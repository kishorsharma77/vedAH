As noted in the publ. intro., the content of this vs. is quite baffling, though the syntax and, for the most part, the lexicon are not. Ge (n. 3) pronounces it a “dunkler Sagenzug,” and I can only agree. I have argued that it is connected with the even more baffling VI.48.17 (see comm. there) and that these two passages associate Pūṣan with the “tearing off the Sun’s wheel” myth that remains tantalizingly out of our reach. But this must remain speculation.

The paruṣé gávi tr., “in ‘the gray cow’,” is of course masc., so should perhaps be “gray bull,” though I meant cow=bovine. The phrase is reminiscent of V.27.5 paruṣā́ḥ … ukṣánaḥ “gray bulls/oxen,” but that phrase is in a dānastuti and does not help us with the metaphor here. For another possible - if extremely tenuous - connection see comm. ad X.5.5.
