As discussed ad IV.48.1 and VI.1.5, I take the phrase rā́yo aryáḥ “the riches of the stranger” here and in IV.48.1 (cf. also VI.47.9; also aryáḥ … rayíḥ in VI.20.1) and the phrase rā́ya ubháyāso jánānām “both the riches of the peoples” in VI.1.5 as referring metaphorically to people, as the most valuable resource of a society. In our passage there are three different parallel designations for these same people: “the clans of Manu” (mánuṣo víśaḥ) understood from the last pāda of the previous vs. (2d), “the riches of the Ārya” (pāda b), and “the Āyus” (āyávaḥ in c). To make matters more complex, these people are not only contending among themselves -- that is, divided and engaging in internal conflict -- but are also fighting united against common enemies, namely the Dasyu (dásyum) and one without commandment (avratám), as was already seen by Ge (n. 3). This is the usual “fission and fusion” model of Rigvedic society, as discussed at length by Proferes (2007, esp. Chap. 2).

The internal conflict is expressed in the first hemistich by the reciprocal verb spárdhante ‘they contend with each other’, while the second hemistich concerns their joint enterprises, expressed by the participles tū́rvantaḥ ‘overcoming’ and sī́kṣantaḥ ‘seeking to vanquish’.
