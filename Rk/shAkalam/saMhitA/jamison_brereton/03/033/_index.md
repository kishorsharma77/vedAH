Visvá ̄mitra and the Rivers  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina / Rivers  
13 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 13  
Although this hymn is found in the Indra collection, the Anukramaṇī identifies  Indra as the dedicand only of verses 6–7, with the remainder divided between the  rivers (Nadyas: 1–3, 5, 9, 11–13) and the poet himself, Viśvāmitra (4, 8, 10). After  two opening verses describing the confluence of the Vipāś and Śutudrī rivers, this  justly famous poem consists of a dialogue between those rivers and Viśvāmitra,  who begs the rivers to stop in their course to allow the Bharata forces, under his  patron, King Sudās (not named here, but see III.53.9), to cross. They accede to his  request in return for his ensuring their future fame in his poetry, and the Bharatas  cross successfully, as is announced in verse 12—after which the rivers are urged  to refill themselves with water and flow again. That it is the poet who succeeds in  temporarily stopping the rivers is yet another example of the power of properly  formulated speech to control the physical world. The final verse (13), in a different  meter, may be a magic spell, exemplifying the continuing belief in the power of the  word by applying this legendary river crossing to a team in trouble at a ford.514 III.33
