yásmai √yaj presents the classic parasmaipada configuration: “sacrifice for someone else,” but āyájase is resolutely middle. I do not have a good explanation for this beyond the fact that the functional distinction between act. yájati and mid. yájate is not well developed in the RV, esp. with preverb ā́, and also that Agni, the subject, is essentially sacrificing to himself.

Although act. sā́dhati can be transitive (and WG so tr. it), it also has intransitive/absolute uses (cf. the same tag in VI.70.3). Moreover, in this hymn sādháyati (3a, 4c) serves as the transitive counterpart; the poet seems to have constructed an -ati /-áyati Grundverb/Kaus. relationship.
