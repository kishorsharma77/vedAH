vaṭūrín- (/mahā́vaṭūrin-) in cd is an impossible hapax, and the wisest course (taken by Ge, WG) is not to tr. it. (Re tries out éperonné ‘spurred on’, with no indication of where he got it.) Unwisely I tender both a tr. (‘overcoming obstacles’) and an etymology, though more in a spirit of adventure than with any confidence that they are correct. I start with the idiom vṛtrá- √tṝ ‘overcome obstacle(s)’, found, e.g., in the fairly well-attested neut. noun vṛtratū́rya- and adj. vṛtratúr-. A hypothetical Middle Indic form to an underlying *vṛtratū/ur- would be *vaṭṭa-tū/ur- (since dentals following original *ṛ often undergo retroflexion: see von Hinüber, Mittelindisch2 165). This could then undergo haplology to *vaṭṭū/ur- and then simplification of the cluster (though we might expect *vāṭū/ur-) to the form to which an -in-suffix was affixed. This is more machinery than should be deployed to explain a hapax, but the explanation falls (loosely) within the realm of possibility -- and a MIA source would fit with the other words in the hymn belonging to a lower or aberrant register. Still it would probably be more sensible to follow Kuiper (see EWA s.v.) in taking it as a non-Indo-Aryan word.

Even leaving aside vaṭūrin-, the verse doen’t make a lot of sense: what does it mean for Indra to cut off heads with his foot?
