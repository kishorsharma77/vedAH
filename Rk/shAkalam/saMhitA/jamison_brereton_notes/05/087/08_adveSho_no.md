The first word in the vs. adveṣáḥ must be adverbial; it of course resonates with the 2nd to last word in the vs., dvéṣāṃsi.

The construction of the gen. (or possibly, in principle, abl.) phrase víṣṇor maháḥ isn’t entirely clear. Old is insistent that it belongs with the voc. samanyavaḥ, hence “of equal fervor with Viṣṇu,” but this adj. is not otherwise construed with a third party but indicates that those so described are equally fervent with each other.

Moreover, the genitive is not the most likely case for the proposed meaning, and we might also expect the gen. phrase to lose its accent or take vocative accent if it were part of the vocative phrase. The standard tr. take the gen. as simply identifying the Maruts as “Viṣṇu’s,” and this may well be the best way to do it. The publ. tr.

construes it with smát ‘together with’ at the beginning of d, as Gr also indicates. The genitive case is problematic, however: smát takes the instr. Further, as Ge points out, rather than smát we should expect *asmát, the 1st pl. abl. prn. to be construed with yuyotana … ápa dvéṣāṃsi “keep hatreds away from us”; see parallels cited by Ge in n. 8d. Unfortunately asmát does not work metrically. WG cleverly suggest that the end of c and the beg. of d, underlyingly *yuyotanā̆ *asmát, were combined in sandhi as *yuyotanāsmát and then decoupled first into *yuyotanā, smát and then, with shortening of the variable final vowel of the impv., to the transmitted yuyotana, smát.

The instr. daṃsánā must belong with the simile: cf. VIII.101.2 tā́bāhútā ná daṃsánā ratharyataḥ “With their wondrous skill as if with their arms they drive their chariot,” also adduced by Ge.
