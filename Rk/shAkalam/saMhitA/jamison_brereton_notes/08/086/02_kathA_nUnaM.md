The danger of imposing an after-the-fact narrative explanation onto a RVic hymn is shown by Ge’s tr. of vímanāḥ here as “Betrübte” (distressed, afflicted).

Although a negative reading of this compound is possible (“without a mind, with a mind [gone] away”), the only other occurrence of the word in the RV (X.82.2) is as a positive attribute of Viśvakarman, “vast in mind.” There is no reason that this sense cannot be found here as well; the next pāda states that the Aśvins gave him insight (dhíyam), and the question in our pāda -- how (kathā́) to praise the Aśvins -- need not be “how can someone with a disordered mind manage to praise them?” but rather “which of the many possible ways should someone with a capacious mind choose for praising them?” The questions in VIII.84.4-7, a hymn that belongs with ours though the Anukramaṇī attributes them to different poets (see remarks before VIII.81 in the publ. tr.), are similar.
