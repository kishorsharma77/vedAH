The adj. urukramá- ‘wide-striding’ is otherwise used only of Viṣṇu (5x), but here encompasses Indra as well, in the dual.

The dual dvandva voc. índrāviṣṇū that opened vs. 5 is here divided into two pāda-final vocc. in c (viṣṇo), d (indra). Presumably because they belong to separate clauses, the dvandva doesn’t decompose into a vāyav indraś ca construction, but it does follow such constructions in placing the 2nd member of the dvandva first (see my 1988 “Vāyav indraś ca revisited,” MSS 49: 13-59).
