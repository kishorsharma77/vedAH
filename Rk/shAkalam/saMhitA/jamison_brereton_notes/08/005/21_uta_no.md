This vs. is structured very like vs. 9, presenting some of the same syntactic problems, but in a somewhat clearer fashion. The first two pādas, utá no divyā́íṣa, utá síndhūm̐r aharvidā are identical to 9ab utá no gómatīr íṣa, utá sātī́r aharvidā, save for the adj. modifying íṣaḥ in a and the acc. pl. found in b. Recall that Ge and Re supply a verb (voḷhám) for ab, separating those pādas from c. Some support for their position might be found in the larger context of vs. 21: the immediately preceding pāda, 20c, contains váhatam with a variant íṣaḥ object (“fat,” not “heavenly”). So it could be possible to read 21ab as a continuation of the VP in 20c, giving support to Ge/Re, who supply a verb from the same root (√vah) to govern the identically structured 9ab. But Ge happily takes ab as the obj. of the verb in 21c, ápa … varṣathaḥ ‘you two will open up’ (s-aor. subjunctive to √vṛ ‘cover, obstruct’). As was noted ad vs. 9, ápa √vṛ ‘uncover, open up’ is semantically very like ví √sā ‘unfasten’, and if refreshments can be the object of the first, this should also be possible for the second.

varṣathaḥ is the only s-aor. form to √vṛ in all of Sanskrit. It is very possible that it was created for this passage because the resulting syllable varṣ evokes the root √vṛṣ ‘rain’, which would be appropriate for the liquids that are its objects in ab. Re also remarks on this word play.
