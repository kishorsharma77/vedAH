According to the opinio communis (Ge, Re, Lü 204 [of IX.61.10], Klein DGRV I.402), jātám ándhasaḥ in pāda b (and the same expression in IX.61.10) contains a substantivized neut. ppl. jātám ‘birth’ with dep. gen. (e.g., Ge “die Geburt deines Tranks”).

However, IX.18.2 mádhu prá jātám ándhasaḥ “the honey born from the stalk” suggests that ‘honey’ (vel sim.) should be supplied here as well, with ándhasaḥ an abl. of source, though Re specifically rejects IX.18.2 as relevant for this passage.

The function of the two yáthā clauses is not altogether clear. I assume that they refer to the two prerequisites for the soma sacrifice: the verbal portion with its praise of the god Soma and the physical production of the ritual substance soma. With both accomplished, the god Soma can take his place on the ritual ground.

On injunc. sadaḥ as a functional impv. see comm. ad IX.2.2 and KH (Injunk. 263).
