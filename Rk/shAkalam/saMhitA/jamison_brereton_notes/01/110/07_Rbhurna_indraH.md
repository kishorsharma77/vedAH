In my interpr. the individuation of the Ṛbhus continues in ab, though not with their usual names.

Note the switch in number between the opening of 6d ṛbhávo vā́jam (pl. - sg.) and that of 7b ṛbhúr vā́jebhiḥ (sg. - pl.).

In b the instr. pls. vā́jebhir vásubhiḥ are ordinarily taken as proper names and instr. of accompaniment. I instead take them as defining the quality for which the Ṛbhu gets designated ‘good one’ and ‘giver’. My tr. also assumes a chiastic structure in vā́jebhir vásubhiḥ vásur dadíḥ, with the first instr. construed with the last nom. sg.

and the middle two terms belonging together.

The analysis of pṛtsutí- is debated (see, e.g., Re EVP XIII.108; AiG II.2.640 §473aβA.; III.73, §29b; II.1 Nachtr. 67). On the one hand, it appears to be a compound consisting of the root noun pṛ́t- and a primary -ti-stem, probably to √sū ‘impel’ (with shortening, like sú-ṣuti to the other root √sū ‘give birth’). On the other, since the root noun pṛ́t- is only attested in the loc. pl. pṛtsú (though the root is also found in the derivatives pṛ́tanā-, etc.), pṛtsutí- appears to be a secondary -tí- stem anomalously built to a case form. This seems to be the current standard view.

However, it seems entirely possible to me that we are dealing with a haplology of

*pṛtsu-sutí- (or -sūtí-), and my tr. reflects this analysis.
