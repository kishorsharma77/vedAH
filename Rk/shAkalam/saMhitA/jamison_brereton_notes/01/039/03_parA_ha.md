Standard treatments (including Old) divide pāda a into a rel. cl. and main clause (e.g., Ge “Was fest ist, stosset ihr um”), accounting for the accent on hathá by its placement immediately after the rel. cl. However, this interpr. requires taking yát sthirám as an embedded relative, preceded by the preverb+part. associated with the main verb (párā ha). Since RV does not (ordinarily) have embedded relatives, it is best to take yád as the subordinator for the whole hemistich (with domain over vartáyatha as well). This also makes the two pādas more parallel: Ge’s tr. of b as also consisting of rel. cl. main cl. (“was schwer ist, bringet …”) is impossible.
