An alternative syntactic analysis of ab would take everything through vā in b as part of the yádi clause with rāráṇaḥ as verb, and start the main clause with dádhase, accented because it’s clause-initial: “If you will take pleasure in my pressed (soma) or in my solemn speech, you will find delight.” There are no strong arguments either way.
