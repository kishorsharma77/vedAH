Here again, as in vs. 4, the dhā́māni of Soma are recipients of the oblation; Ge’s Formen again works more smoothly, but I still consider these to be the locales listed in 4ab, each of which can be a site of sacrifice.

Note the disharmony in number between the neut. pl. subj. (tā́viśvā) and the sg. pred. nom. (paribhū́ḥ) and verb (astu). This could be an example of the inherited construction of neuter pl. with a singular verb, but I think it’s more likely just a constructio ad sensum, with “all these” summarizing the plural subjects of the rel. cl.

as if in a mass. English “all this” can be similarly used, after a listing of discrete entities. The Sanskrit has just been more punctilious about maintaining number agreement.

Ge, Re, WG all supply ‘lifetime’ as the implicit object of pratáraṇaḥ, rather than my ‘us’; they are most likely correct, given how common the idiom ā́yus- prá √tṝ is. I might change the publ. tr. to “lengthening (our lifetime).”
