I follow Janert (1956, Sinne und Bedeutung des Wortes “dhāsi” und seiner Belegstellen im Rigveda und Awesta) in taking dhāsí- as ‘wellspring’.

The post-caesura phrase in c bhinád ádriṃ vidád gā́ḥ contains rhyming verbs followed by their objects; the disyllable ádrim contrasts with monosyllable gā́ḥ, creating an almost syncopated effect. The strict parallelism of the two VPs may account for the unnecessary accent on bhinát, which functions rhetorically like a fronted verb, just like vidát. In fact, as my tr. indicates, I consider the initial subject bṛ́haspátiḥ to be essentially extrasentential, a very topicalized topic.

The second of the VPs is also a mirror-image of the final phrase in 2d gā́ ávindan (imperfect in 2, versus aorist in 3), and it can be considered a “repair” of the somewhat opaque vidát … dhāsím “found the wellspring” that intervenes (3b).
