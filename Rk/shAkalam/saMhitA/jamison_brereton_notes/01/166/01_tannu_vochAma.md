It may not be sufficiently clear in the publ. tr. that “the beacon of the bull” refers to the Maruts themselves. They are presumably Indra’s “beacon” because they are regularly his comrades and they are of glittering appearance -- a little bit like Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer.

The pair “kindling” and “battle” in cd may not seem to form a natural class, but they probably represent two aspects of the Maruts’ naturalistic identity as the thunderstorm: the lightning may be the kindling and the thunder the clash of battle.

Note the phonological echoes in aidhéva..., yudhéva...; similarly tuviṣvaṇo...

taviṣā́ni.
