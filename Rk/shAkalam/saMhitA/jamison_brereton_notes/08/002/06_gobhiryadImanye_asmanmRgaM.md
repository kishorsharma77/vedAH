A quite opaque verse. The underlying point, in the context of the preceding verse, is that though our own preparations of soma may not be of the best, Indra will still come to our sacrifice (vs. 5), even if other sacrificers aggressively pursue him with (better-tasting) soma mixed with cows’ milk. The repetition of two words for cow (góbhiḥ opening the verse and dhenúbhiḥ closing it) draws attention to the notion and suggests that the other sacrificers have mixed their soma with milk (the most desirable way to serve soma), while our soma was characterized in vs. 5 as unmixed, badly mixed, or “sharp” (?).

Pāda b adds its own difficulties to the verse’s interpretation, esp. the rare and disputed word vrā́-. In Jamison 2003 [HPS Fs.] I discuss this word and its contexts at length, suggesting that it means ‘(female) chooser’ (that is, the bride at a svayaṃvara “self-choice” wedding) and is a reduced form of *varā́-. This passage gave me pause, however, and in that article I toyed with the possibility that it contains a different word vrā́- or else that its meaning had become attenuated because it was moribund. I now think that it is the same word vrā́- and that it does here compare the other sacrificers to women chasing husbands, perhaps hinting at the unseemly nature of this pursuit. I take mṛgám … mṛgáyante as a phrasal verb with a cognate accusative, so meaning simply “go hunting.” Note that the accent on abhitsáranti requires it to be part of the yád clause, leaving the verse without a main clause and making its dependence on vs. 5 clear.
