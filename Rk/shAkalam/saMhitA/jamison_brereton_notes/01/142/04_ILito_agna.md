mátiḥ … vacyáte “the thought is twisting its way” gives potential support to the interpretation of úpa hvarate in the previous hymn I.141.1 as having matíḥ as its subj. (contrary to my view), but the other considerations raised ad loc. weigh more strongly for me. As for vacyáte, the “passive” accentuation of this apparently intrans.

verb of motion is treated at length by Kulikov (-ya-presents, pp. 218-23), who acknowledges the standard functional interpr. of this pres. but attempts (rather too ingeniously in my view) to take it as originally passive (“is being directed towards you” in his tr.). Since √vañc seems to me to express precisely non-direct(ed) action, this interpr. does not capture the sense. I do not have a good explanation of the suffix accent, beyond noting that there are other non-passive medial -yá- formations, most notably mriyáte ‘dies’, that have failed to retract the accent.
