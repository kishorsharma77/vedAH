Once again, the attributes and actions ascribed to Sarasvatī are decidedly unfeminine, starting with the almost comically off-kilter comparison of her to a rootgrubbing boar. The identification of the bisakhā́- as a boar is owing to Hoffmann (MSS 8: 5 = Aufs. 387). The point of comparison between the river and the boar must be their noise: śúṣmebhiḥ ‘with her snortings’, though the root-grubbing is presumably part of it, as the river in spate noisily pulls off pieces of the banks.

Note ávase in c, which echoes avasám in 1c and is in turn echoed by á (vi)vās(ema) in d.
