The standard view of avaródhanam is that it defines a closed or fortified place (Ge “der verschlossene Ort des Himmels”; Re “le rempart du ciel”; Doniger [133] “where heaven is enclosed”) - deriving ródhana- from √rudh ‘confine, hem in’. But I take it instead to the other √rudh (/ruh) ‘grow’ and interpr. it as ‘means of ascent’, exactly like róhaṇaṃ diváḥ in I.52.9 (q.v.). So my vision of heaven is a more welcoming place, that extends a ladder down for us to make the ascent.
