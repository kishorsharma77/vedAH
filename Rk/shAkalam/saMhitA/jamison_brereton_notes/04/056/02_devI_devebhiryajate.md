This vs. contains several puns, including a repetition of śucáyadbhir árkaiḥ from 1d. The final word of the 1st hemistich ukṣámāṇe can belong either to √ukṣ ‘sprinkle’ or to √vakṣ ‘grow’, and both are appropriate. And the preceding negated participle áminatī can take different objects and utilize different senses of the root √mī. On the one hand, as Re (and others) point out, the other occurrence of áminatī (I.92.12=124.2) takes daívyāni vratā́ni “heavenly commandments” as object.

However, cf. nearby ámīta-varṇa- ‘of immutable color’ (IV.51.9), which supports Ge’s “ohne (ihr Aussehen) zu verändern.”
