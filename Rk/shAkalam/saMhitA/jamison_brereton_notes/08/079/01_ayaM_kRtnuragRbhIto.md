Both kṛtnú- and udbhíd- appear to be gambling terms here. For kṛtnú- in a gambling context see I.92.10, for udbhíd- X.116.9. udbhíd- means literally ‘bursting/breaking out [/up]’. The semantic development may be something like “break out of the pack / burst to the finish.” viśvajít- ‘all-conquering’ can also fit the gambling scenario, as, arguably, can ágṛbhīta- ‘ungraspable’ -- that is, who is too far ahead to be caught or caught up to. The hymn is ascribed to Kṛtnu Bhārgava; Bhārgava is of course a fairly common patronymic, but Kṛtnu appears only here, clearly lifted from the hymn’s first pāda.

The final pāda consists entirely of the three most resonant words for poet/poetic activity: ṛ́ṣi- ‘seer’, vípra- ‘inspired poet’, kā́vya- (standing for kaví- ‘sage poet’). The juxtaposition of the gambling focus of the first two pādas with the poetic lexicon of the last is striking, but sets the tone for the rest of the hymn, which catalogues the variety of Soma’s skills.
