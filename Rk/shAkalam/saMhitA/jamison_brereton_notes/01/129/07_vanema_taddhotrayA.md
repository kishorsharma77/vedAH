The pun on hávya- in 6b is continued by the same double meaning in hótrā-, a stem that by most accounts does belong both to √hū and √hu. (The standard tr.

only render it by ‘oblation’ here, however.) The fem. citántī-, which looks like a participle to a 6th cl. pres. or (so Wh Rts.) a root aor., is formally isolated and requires metrical distraction. Gr suggests (on no particular basis) emending to *cetáyantyā, but how would such a corruption arise? WG’s *citáyantyā is more plausible but perhaps unnecessary. Lowe (Participles 289) takes it as a Caland adjective beside citrá-, but this also seems unnecessary.

The part. sántam in c at first seems pleonastic; it does not have its regular concessive value. But it was most likely included here in order to indicate which noun the adj. raṇvám modifies. By itself raṇvám could qualify either rayím or survī́ryam in b, but sántam identifies it as a masc. and therefore belonging to rayím, since suvī́ryam is neut. (WG’s use of suvī́ryam as an adj. with rayím in bc is contrary to the usage of this stem elsewhere.)
