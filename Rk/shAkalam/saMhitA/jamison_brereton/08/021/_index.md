Indra (1–16), Citra’s Dānastuti (17–18)
Sobhari Kāṇva
18 verses: kakubh alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
This hymn ends with a brief dānastuti to king Citra (vss. 17–18) and begins with a  pun on his name: in verse 1 Indra is described as citrá “brilliant.” In between the  poet ponders the various different relationships that he and his people might have  with Indra, deploying a surprising range of terminology: “comrade” (vss. 2, 8, 14,  15), “kin” (vs. 4), “rival” (vs. 13), “friend” (vs. 13), and “father” (vs. 14). Amid the  standard invitations to the soma sacrifice (e.g., vss. 3, 5) and praise of Indra’s quali
ties (e.g., vs. 10), the poet depicts himself and his people as previously deprived of  Indra (vs. 7), but as possessing hopes and visions of the god’s entering into rela tionship with them (see esp. vs. 6), and he imagines what they could achieve if this  relationship were activated (vss. 11–12). The stress on the 1st plural “we” (including  Indra along with the mortals) and on “our” states of mind is highly unusual in  R̥gvedic poetry.
The poet’s conception of possible relationships develops in even more unpredict able ways toward the end of the hymn. The pragātha strophe consisting of verses  13–14 begins strikingly by calling Indra friendless, and continues in verse 14 with a  brief and idiosyncratic characterization of some who don’t have relationships with  Indra. The following pragātha (vss. 15–16) urges “us” not to miss our own chance  with Indra, with a noteworthy comparison of “our” potentially damaging lack of  activity to that of aging spinsters.
Thus, though much of the hymn contains conventional Indra-hymn material,  there is a distinct “psychological” tinge to the poet’s depiction of the interaction of  his group with Indra. This depiction of an emotional bond between the worshipers  and the deity makes the abrupt transition to the dānastuti all the more surprising,  especially because the dānastuti seems to belittle Indra’s giving in comparison to  King Citra’s.
