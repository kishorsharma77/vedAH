Although ūtyā́could be taken with the impv., the instr. of ūtí- has a robust relationship with citrá- elsewhere (e.g. I.172.1, II.17.8, IV.23.2, VI.10.5, VI.26.5).

vidā́in the Saṃhitā text can represent either a lengthened form of the impv.

vida or a subj. vidā́ḥ (so Pp., also Gr, Lub). Both Ge and Re tr. as an impv. (as do I), which fits the imperatival tone of the hymn better than a subjunctive.; see esp.

parallel codaya in b. Although neither Gr nor Lub gives other imperatives to this stem, most of the forms analyzed as vidā́ḥ are better taken as imperatives like this one (e.g., I.36.14, 71.7, VIII.61.7).

The particle tú, which ordinarily takes standard 2nd position, is out of place here. The same sequence, tucé tú naḥ, is also found in VIII.27.14, where it is also out of place. I have no explanation.
