Soma Pavamāna
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
Attributed to Vasiṣṭha, the poet of the VIIth Maṇḍala, this hymn ends (vs. 6d) with the  Vasiṣṭha clan refrain, encountered constantly in VII. Martial images dominate, start ing with verse 1 and showcased especially in verse 3 (see also 4cd and 5ab). The aim  of war, to secure peace and prosperity, is depicted in the center of the hymn (vs. 4ab).  Some of the divine beneficiaries of Soma’s invigorating capability are listed in verse 5.
