The very first hemistich of this hymn presents us with a syntactic problem: although the most natural way to read this is with a rel. clause beginning with yó ha and continuing through the second pāda, the verb there, dhāḥ, is unaccented. There are three possible ways to handle this. The first, the one I followed in the publ. tr., is to assume that dhāḥ got de-accented for some reason. Several possible reasons are available, though none of them strong: 1) it lost its accent redactionally from being matched to (properly) unaccented dhāt in 2b, also at the end of its hemistich; 2) the same idiom áme (…) dhāt is found in nearby I.67.3 (unfortunately by a different poet) and this caused the loss of accent redactionally; 3) because the 2nd hemistich of the verse in question is also a subordinate clause (beginning yád dha), the previous subordinate clause lost its verbal accent and became a kind of “honorary” main clause, because the action of cd is based on that of the relative clause that precedes it.

(This seems to be one possibility that Old floats, though he is rather sketchy about it.) Though Ge does not mention the lack of accent, he tr. the whole as a rel clause.

The other two ways to deal with the problem involve having the rel. clause end at the end of the first pāda. Old also suggested the possibility that the rel. cl. is limited to yó ha śúṣmaiḥ. Re, Hoffmann (1967: 181), and WG all follow this path, with tr. of the type “You are great, Indra, who are (so) because of your śúṣma.” I rejected that because of its awkwardness, although I recognized that it solves the accentless verb problem, since the main clause can occupy pāda b without problem.

A third way, also ending the relative clause with the end of the first pāda, seems to me to be less clumsy, and that is to make all of the first pāda the relative clause.

Though yáḥ appears to be fairly far into that clause, in fact it is not preceded by more than one constituent (plus a vocative, which doesn’t count). This produces a tr.

“(you) who are great because of your śúṣma-, you placed ….” This actually has a parallel in IV.22.3 yó deváḥ …, mahó vā́jebhir mahádbhiś ca śúṣmaiḥ “The god who … is great by reason of his prizes and his great śúṣma.” I would therefore now change the tr. accordingly, to this third option.

The next problem in this half verse is the construction of áme √dhā. All the standard tr. render it more or less as “you put Heaven and Earth in panic/fear.” This makes sense of the syntax, but attenuates the meaning of the noun: áma- is an attack or onslaught, or more abstractly offensive power, whereas ‘panic, fear’ suggests the opposite. Therefore, although slightly more machinery is required, I tr. this idiom (found also in I.67.3, IV.17.7) as “put X in the path/way of your onslaught.” Notice that here Nodhas manages to deploy a perfectly orthodox de-coupled dual dvandva for Heaven and Earth (dyā́vā … pṛthivī́). See remarks on I.61.14, 62.8.

The subject NP(s) of cd are neatly interwoven: with víśvā … ábhvā (neut.) chained with giráyaś cid … dṛḷḥā́saḥ (masc.).

Hoffmann (p. 181) argues convincingly that naíjan should not be interpreted as ná aíjan with the Pp., but with the injunctive éjan.
