As in vs. 9, symbolic anointing, here by means of a chant or song, is still represented as physical: Agni “shines” because of it, presumably gleaming from the conceptual fat. I take gāyatréṇa as referring specifically to the Gāyatrī meter (in which this hymn is composed), though it may merely be ‘song’, as Ge (/WG) take it.
