Both Ge and Re take ajani ‘has been born’ in c as the main verb for ab, while I take ab as a separate nominal cl. Either is possible. I would be more inclined towards the Ge/Re solution if mánmanaḥ were an ablative, parallel to abhrā́t in the simile (“has been born *from this conception, like rain from a cloud”). But though mánmanaḥ itself could be abl., it is anchored as a gen. by asyá, which must be adjectival (and hence go with mánmanaḥ) because of its accent. In fact, at least in tr.

“this … praise hymn of this conception” is a clumsy expression, though both Ge and Re make it slighly less so by adding ‘mine’ (“of this conception of mine”). Though 118 the 1st ps. ref. is not found in the text, it does ameliorate the tr. The point is the usual one, that the verbal product, the hymn, arises from the poet’s mental functions.
