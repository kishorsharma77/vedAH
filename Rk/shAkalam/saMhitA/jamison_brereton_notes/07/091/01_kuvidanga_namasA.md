For my interpr. of the context of this vs. see the publ. intro., where I suggest that the vs. depicts the primal situation before the ritual was first instituted, with the gods existing without a sacrificial compact. I take purā́… ā́san as existential, “existed previously,” as I do almost the same construction (but with pf., not impf.) in IV.51.7 purā́suḥ -- but not purā́-āsitha in VI.45.11, where the purā́is contrasted with nūnám in disjunctive vā clauses. The existential reading seems to me preferable to a predicative one, whether vṛdhā́saḥ or anavadyā́saḥ were to be predicated.

The construction of kuvíd is unusual, in that it appears on the surface that the kuvíd construction consists of a rel. clause introduced by yé without a main clause.

Old’s first suggested rendering is of this type (“Bewiesen sich wohl einst die Götter als tadellos?”); similarly Hettrich (Hypotaxe, 145). But Old alternatively suggests supplying a main verb with kuvíd with the relative clause subordinate to that clause (“Wie denn (verhielten sich) die Götter, welche ... waren?”), a syntactic solution silently adapted by Re. In either case ā́san would unproblematically be accented because it belongs to the rel. cl. Although my interpr. differs somewhat from Ge’s, we both take ā́san as the verb of the main clause with kuvíd (“Ganz gewiss waren es schon früher die untadeligen Götter …”), with the rel. clause either requiring a verb to be supplied (Ge) or simply being a nominal rel. cl. (me). By this interpr. the accentuation of ā́san would contradict Gr’s rule (s.v. kuvíd) that the verb introduced by kuvíd is accented only when it is in the same pāda -- but see comm. ad II.35.1 for further violations of this “rule.” The construction I envisage runs into another problem, that the rel. cl. (námasā yé vṛdhā́saḥ) would seem to be embedded in the main clause kuvíd … ā́san). But we have seen elsewhere (e.g., VI.21.2, 22.5, 64.5, 6) that nominal relative clauses can function as pseudo/proto-izafe constructions and be embedded in the matrix clause. Here the rel. cl. would, further, precede the main clause proper, beginning with purā́, and be preceded only by the rhetorical introductory kuvíd aṅgá, so its “embedding” is slight.

For “hard-pressed Manu” see VI.49.13.
