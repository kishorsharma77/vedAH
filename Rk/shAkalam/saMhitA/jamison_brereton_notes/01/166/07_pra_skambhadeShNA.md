The rendering of alātṛṇá- as ‘restless’ follows the suggestion of Hoffmann’s (‘unruhig’) registered in KEWA III.807 and EWA s.v., derived from √rā ‘be at rest’.

The word is found elsewhere only in III.30.10, of Vala. In neither passage does ‘unquiet, restless’ fit the context terribly well, but in neither is it excluded. Kuiper (Aryans, 84-85, in part restating his 1955 Fs. Kirfel views) objects to Hoffmann’s explanation and suggests instead the meaning ‘irresistible’ for our passage and ‘not offering resistance’ for III.30.10. (On a side note, these two meanings, reflecting passive ‘not (to be) resisted’ and active ‘not resisting’ senses respectively, do not seem to me derivationally compatible and should not be found in a single word.) He considers it to be a substrate borrowing and thinks it’s not realistic to expect it to have an etymology. Kuiper has some good points: as was just noted, the meaning produced by the Hoffmann etymology is not a perfect fit contextually and the morphology is somewhat dubious. However, I do not see confidently proposing two incompatible meanings for a single word (with the one suggested for this passage not particularly compelling in context) while forswearing any attempt at etymology.

Better to leave it untranslated in that case.

Pādas c and d are in reverse logical order. The contents of the chant that the Maruts chant (c) must be the deeds of Indra, which they are said to know (d); the knowledge logically precedes the verbal expression of it.
