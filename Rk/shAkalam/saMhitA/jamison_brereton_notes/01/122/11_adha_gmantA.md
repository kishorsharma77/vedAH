The dual part. gmántā of pāda a does not match the pl. impv. śrótā of b nor the pl. voc. rājānaḥ in the same pāda. Drawing the distinction did not seem worth it in the publ. tr. -- which would have to be something like “as you two go …, (do all of you) hear …” The number discrepancy is generally (and in my opinion correctly) interpreted as first a reference to Mitra and Varuṇa and then to the Ādityas as a group. M+V were prominent earlier (vss. 6-7, 9; see also 15c, the final vs.) and in fact in vs. 7 ushered in the dānastuti. The plural phrase in b is used precisely of the three principal Ādityas, including explicitly M+V, in X.93.5: té ghā rā́jāno amṛ́tasya mandrā́, aryamā́mitró váruṇaḥ … This parallel also shows that Scar’s clever idea (171, followed by WG) to construe amṛ́tasya with the verb śrótā cannot be correct.

In c Old takes the hapaxes nabhojū́- and niravá- in full lexical value, rather than as PN, and, at least acdg. to Mayr. (PN, svv.), this remains a live possibility.

However, in the dānastuti context names are more likely, though they can be speaking names. That -jū- echoes -jūta- in 10a and -ravá- echoes ruvaṇyú- in 5a (assuming an analysis ni-ravá- with Old, rather than nir-avá- with Gr) is presumably no accident: puns on personal names are a standard RVic poetic device.
