The (pseudo-)participle dhiyasāná- clearly patterns with dīdhi ye in 1a, hence my complementary ‘being conjured up’. I take it to mean that Indra’s epiphany at the sacrifice is brought about by our chants (arkaíḥ), that his appearance there is literally “thought up” by our thoughts. This notion is close to what is found in the previous hymn V.32.11 (at least by my interpr.), that every sacrifice brings a “newest Indra,” that the Indra of the sacrificial epiphany is newly created by sacrificial activity every time. The standard interpr. of dhiyasāná- by Ge [/WG] is more pedestrian: Indra becomes attentive (“aufmerksam geworden”) through our hymns. The other occurrence of the stem, in X.32.1, in my opinion fits my interpr., but to be honest neither passage is absolutely clear. As for the stem itself, dhiyasāná- does not pattern with the majority of -asāná- stems discussed ad IV.3.6, and I do not have a satisfactory account of it.

The sá tvám phrase does not conform to my rules for the use of sá with 2nd ps.

reference (see my “Sá figé”), and I likewise can’t account for it.

The yā́(ḥ) beginning the 2nd hemistich is problematic. If it is a rel. prn. it has to be a fem. pl., and there is no obvious referent in the context (hárīṇām in b belonging to a masc. stem hári-). Therefore with Ge (/WG) and, very cautiously, Old, I take it as a verb form, belonging to √yā ‘drive’. (Note the past part. yātā́ḥ in 5b.) Because it is followed by two subjunctives, vákṣaḥ and sakṣi (the latter a “siimperative” derived from a subjunctive), I take yā́(ḥ) as subjunctive as well. Indeed, if it is read yāah, the extra syllable would fix the meter of this pāda -- but since the hymn is full of metrical disturbances, this is not a strong argument. Neither Ge nor WG indicates how they interpr. the morphology, but both tr. as an imperative, as they do the two following verbs.

Both Ge and WG take aryáḥ and jánān as parallel acc. pl., while I make aryáḥ a gen. sg. dependent on jánān. There is no way to tell; Thieme (Fremdl., 11 n. 2) refuses to deal with the passage at all.
