It is not clear whether nítya- in this context has already developed its later technical sense of regular, obligatory ritual offering, as opposed to those performed irregularly for special purposes. Or whether it simply means, as Re takes the phrase nítyena havíṣā, “une offrande personnelle.” I have pushed the last phrase sā́sad iṣṭíḥ to “this desire will be” -- that is, “will come true” -- rather than simply “this will be his desire” (so Ge [WG]), since I otherwise find it difficult to interpr. the subjunctive.
