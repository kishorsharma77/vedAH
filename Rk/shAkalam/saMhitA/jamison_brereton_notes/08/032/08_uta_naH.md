I do not understand Ge’s tr. of saṃrarāṇáḥ as ‘mitteilsam’ (communicative, talkative) and as if it were an adjective modifying food (“bring us mitteilsam Speise…”). (I assume that the specialization of this German cmpd for [verbal] communication postdates Ge’s language acquisition stage and his usage reflects some sense of teilen ‘divide, share’.) Kü (421) suggests that this participle means “bereitwillig, spendefreudig,” implying that it is used absolutely and doesn’t take an object. This certainly is possible here, but doesn’t bring us to Ge’s rendering.

In any case, the form here (-rarāṇáḥ to √rā) echoes rāráṇaḥ (to √ran) in 6a.
