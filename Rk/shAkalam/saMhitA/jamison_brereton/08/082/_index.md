Indra
Kusīdin Kāṇva
9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
This hymn is an insistent invitation to the soma sacrifice, punctuated by impera tives: “run,” “come here,” “drink,” and so forth, and larded with descriptions of the  soma in various stages of preparation. It is simple in diction and entirely focused  on the ritual situation and the hope for Indra’s arrival, save for the last verse (9),  which alludes briefly to the myth of the stealing of soma from heaven. The last tr̥ca  is marked by a refrain.
