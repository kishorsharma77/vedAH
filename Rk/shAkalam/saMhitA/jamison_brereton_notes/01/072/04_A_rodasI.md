we find rodasī́in acc. usage: the singular consort has simply been grammatically assimilated to the dual world halves in all her appearances.

The intensive part. vévidānāḥ could technically belong either to √vid ‘know’ or √vid ‘find’, whose middle generally means ‘acquire’, and it is somewhat difficult to know which root is supposed to be represented in Ge’s “Gehör finden bei” and Re’s “trouvant-accueil près de.” With Old and Schaeffer (p. 183-85) I take it with ‘find, acquire’, though I am somewhat puzzled by what the intensive part is supposed to contribute - perhaps the sense of constantly keeping their acquisition close by; this would work better for the consort than the two worlds. Schaeffer’s tr. (p. 185) “nachdem sie die beiden hohen Rodasī gefunden haben” has no intensive nuance, and she indeed suggests that the form does not really belong to the intensive, but is a substitute for the perfect participle (*vividānā́ḥ) on metrical grounds, hence her preterital tr. I find this substitution hypothesis unlikely, given that the intensive is quite a marked formation and the accent patterns of the two formations are different.

The Pp. reads rudríyā (neut. pl.), not -āḥ with most tr. As Ge and Old (Noten) point out, the Pp. reading is not impossible, but the masc. pl. works better. If the first pāda makes reference to Rodasī, a nom. pl. referring to the Maruts makes better sense. Tr. differ on the interpretation of nemádhitā; I render it as close to my interpr.

of its other three occurrences, ‘when facing the other side’, used of battle arrays (VI.33.4, VII.27.1, X.93.13). That it refers to men and gods being divided (so Ge, WG) seems farfetched and ignores the evidence of the other identical occurrences and inserts a referent (men and gods) that is simply not there.

The last pāda echoes 2d, except it is Agni standing on the highest track, not his pursuers.
