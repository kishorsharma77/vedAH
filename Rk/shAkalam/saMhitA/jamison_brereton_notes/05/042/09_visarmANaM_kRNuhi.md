The stilted nominal syntax with dummy verb √kṛ + acc. masc. abstract (visarmā́ṇaṃ kṛṇuhi, lit. “make dissipation”), which together govern a neut. acc. vittám, must result from the lack of a transitive pres. to √sṛ ‘flow, run’ -- pace Narten (“Ai. sṛ …” 1969: 83 and n. 16 [=KlSch 130 and n. 16]), who characterizes several forms of ví √sṛ as “transitiv,” though the acc. expresses the goal/place-throughwhich, not a real transitive object.

The expression prasavé vāvṛdhānā́n is not entirely clear and is variously rendered — Ge “'die im Befehl gross sind,” Re “qui (se croyant) renforcés pour la compétition,” Schmidt (B+I 85) “bei (unserer) Regsamkeit wachsen,” WG “obwohl sie in ihrem Unterfangen erstarkt sind” — differing primarily in what prasavá- is taken to mean. By my interpr. these foes, who violate all the norms of Ārya society by refusing to participate in reciprocal exchange, by acting contrary to vratá- (the chains of command that structure Ārya society), and by hating the verbal formulations that express the Ārya view of the cosmos and their place in it, nonetheless show their strength on the attack, the forward thrust. All the tr. reflect this notion one way or another: the regretable strength of the enemies despite their antisocial behavior.
