I have no idea what the exact referent of the “five oxen” is, but given their stationing in the middle of heaven and their apparent retrograde motion, it seems that an astronomical body (a constellation?) is referred to. Ge (/WG) take ní vāvṛtuḥ as “sind … verschwunden,” but ní √vṛt ordinarily means ‘turn back / home’, of bovines, and given that the subject is oxen, albeit metaphorical ones, this idiom works fine in the passage.
