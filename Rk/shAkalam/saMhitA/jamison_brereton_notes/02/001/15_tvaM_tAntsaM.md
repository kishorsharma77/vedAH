On práti … asi, see comm. ad 8d. As far as I can determine, this is the only occurrence of sám √as in the RV and, rather than meaning something like ‘be together’, it seems to have an idiomatic meaning like prati + ACC, ‘be equal to’ (as if to samá- vel sim.).

On the word order in pāda c, see comm. ad VI.15.14.
