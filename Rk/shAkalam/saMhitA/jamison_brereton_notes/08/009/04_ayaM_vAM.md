I take cíketathaḥ ‘attend to’ in a somewhat sinister sense here: with the help (/invigoration) of soma the Aśvins will turn their attention to Vṛtra/the obstacle and take care of the threat he/it poses. However, I am not entirely certain why the Aśvins are being implicated in the Vṛtra battle and assimilated, as it were, to Indra. The gharma of the 1st half-verse is more naturally their drink. But see 7cd below. Note also that in 12a they drive on the same chariot with Indra. On the basis of that hemistich, which also associates them with Vāyu (12b), we can assume that it is their joint appearance at the dawn sacrifice that brings them into conjunction.
