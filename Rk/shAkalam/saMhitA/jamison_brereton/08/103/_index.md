103 (712)  
Agni (1–13), Agni and the Maruts (14)  
Sobhari Kāṇva  
14 verses: br̥hatī 1–4, 6; virāḍrūpā 5; satobr̥hatī 7, 9, 11, 13; kakubh 8, 12; gāyatrī 10;  anuṣṭubh 14. One trca (1–3), 5 prag ̥ āthas (4–13), final verse (14).  
Another metrically complex hymn, consisting mostly of pragāthas in various com binations of meters, but beginning with a tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) and ending with a single  verse (14). Proferes (2007: 38–40) argues that the opening tr̥ca concerns the forg ing of a unified power from multiple clans by commitment to their mutually wor shiped fire, which is identified as belonging to Divodāsa, the great Bharata leader  (vs. 2). The territorial expansion and the overcoming of other populations therein  are treated in verses 2–3.  
Though the pragātha that follows (vss. 4–5) does not explicitly continue the  theme of victory through centralized leadership, it does promise rewards to the  man who devotes himself to Agni—particularly the renowned “imperishable fame”  (ákṣiti śrávaḥ, vs. 5), a phrase whose Indo-European antiquity has been known  and discussed for a century and a half. And “heroic glory” (vīrávad yáśaḥ, vs. 9), as  well as goods and protection, are the rewards for service to Agni in the following  pragāthas (vss. 6–11). The final pragātha (vss. 12–13) seeks to avert Agni’s anger.  In the summary verse (14) the poet names himself and invites Agni to the sacrifice.
