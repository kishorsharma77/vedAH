The first pāda of this vs. lacks a syllable. It is also identical, save for the last word, the verb, with nearby IX.50.1a út te śúṣmāso īrate (attributed to a different poet, Ucathya Āṅgirasa) -- with the disyllabic asthuḥ here replacing the īrate of IX.50.1 and thus responsible for the metrical truncation. The sense of the two verbs úd īrate and úd asthuḥ are essentially identical: ‘arise/have arisen’. One can speculate that either Avatsāra Kāśyapa, a tricky poet, is calling attention to the opening of his poem by the manipulation and metrical truncation of the unimpeachable phrase found in IX.50.1, or that he wanted an aorist and there is no aor. clearly related to the pres. ī́rte, ī́rate (though of course there are aor. forms to its ultimate root √ṛ). Given the near identity of the two pādas, it might have been better had the publ. tr. rendered śúṣmāsaḥ in the same way in both instances, although the two different tr. work better contextually.

As was noted in the publ. intro. and as Ge also points out, this vs. might be more appropriate to Indra, and in particular the voc. adrivaḥ ‘possessor of the stone’ in b is otherwise used almost exclusively of Indra: there are nearly 50 occurrences, of which only one, besides this one, is addressed to anyone but Indra (Varuṇa in VII.89.2). There is in fact nothing in this vs. that imposes or even invites the identification of the 2nd ps. referent as Soma; we only assume it (correctly in my view) because this is a soma hymn.

The syntax of c is slightly unusual, in that the obj. of nudásva is a nominal relative cl.

yā́ḥ parispṛ́dhaḥ “(those) who are the challengers all around,” with the main cl. referent (*tā́ḥ ‘those’) gapped. (See also 3c below.) Generally the gapping of the antecedent to nominal relative clauses is found in “X and which Y” constructions, not when the rel. cl. is not conjoined. It’s worth noting that this pāda is very close semantically to IX.52.3a in the immediately preceding hymn: carúr ná yás tám īṅkhaya “Who is like a pot, give him a shove,” but there the nom. rel. clause carúr ná yáḥ that defines the obj. of the main verb does have an expressed antecedent tám in the main cl. Note that, IX.52 is also attributed to Ucathya, like IX.50, and both hymns contain expressions on which Avatsāra seems to be ringing changes.
