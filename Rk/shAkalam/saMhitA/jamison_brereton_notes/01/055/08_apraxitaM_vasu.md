The etymological figure in b, áṣāḷhaṃ sáhaḥ, rendered here with the somewhat awkward “undominatable dominance” and belonging to the root √sah ‘vanquish, conquer’, is notable in part because the two root syllables ṣāḷh and sah share no surface phonemes, since the past participle has undergone several regular phonological processes that obscure its relationship to sah. Nonetheless any Vedic speaker would instantly see the connection.

The simile in c is a little unclear in the absence of real-world knowledge of life in Vedic India. WG suggest that, on departure from a temporary stopping place, wells need to be covered over to avoid their getting filled in or otherwise damaged; this seems reasonable, although I don’t see that this action needs to be restricted to camps that are being left. In general it makes sense also in permanent settlements to cover wells to avoid their being contaminated. In any case, the simile seems rather more pointed and precise than necessary: that Indra has many hidden powers, mental and physical, is a commonplace, and the image of wells seems, at least to me, a bit of a distraction.
