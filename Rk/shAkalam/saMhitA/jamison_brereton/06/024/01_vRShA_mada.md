Bullish exuberance, noise, and solemn words are in Indra; he is the  drinker of the pressings and in possession of the silvery drink, when  the soma juices are in his company.
He is worthy to be chanted by men with solemn words as the bounteous  one, the heaven-ruling king of hymns, whose help is imperishable.
