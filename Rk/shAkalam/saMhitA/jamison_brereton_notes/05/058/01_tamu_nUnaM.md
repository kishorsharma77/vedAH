On the phrase … gaṇám mā́rutaṃ návyasīnām with its problematic fem. gen. pl. návyasīnām, see the extensive disc. ad V.53.10.

There is complete fungibility between the collective sg. gaṇám mā́rutam “Marutian flock” and the plural yé in the 2nd hemistich referring to the individual Maruts, which picks up gaṇám mā́rutam by sense though not strictly by grammar.

The eṣām at the end of pāda a seems clumsily pleonastic, however. It must refer also to the pl. Maruts and depend on the acc. gaṇám (“the flock of them”), doubling the vṛddhi deriv. mā́rutam. It should not be construed with the fem. návyasīnām.

āśvàśva- shows phonological play, as well as being a buried etymological pun, if the old connection between āśú- and áśva- holds. It is also a kind of anagram for the poet’s name śyāvā́śva-. Note that both words must be distracted to 4 syllables (āśú-aśva and śyāvá-aśva respectively).

The sequence utéśire is entirely ambiguous between utá īśire and utá ī́śire.

The Pp. reads the unaccented verb, but the utá suggests that the verb is conjoined with váhante and belongs to the rel. cl. and should therefore be accented.
