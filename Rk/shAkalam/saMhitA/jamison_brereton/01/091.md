Soma
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
23 verses: triṣṭubh 1–4, gāyatrī 5–16, uṣṇih 17, triṣṭubh 18–23
Long and metrically disunified, this hymn no doubt falls into distinct segments, but  there is no scholarly agreement about the exact divisions. Some verse groupings are  found together in later liturgical texts (e.g., vss. 16–18, which, though in three dif ferent meters, agree in contents), but in other cases there is no external evidence. It  is possible that the triṣṭubh verses at the beginning (vss. 1–4) and those at the end  (vss. 19–23) belong together, with the dimeter verses 5–16 (plus 17–18) having been  inserted between them. This is suggested by the fact that verse 19 starts with the  same sequence as the beginning of verse 4 (yā́ te dhā́māni), and also by the apparent  ring between 1a prá cikitaḥ and 23d prá cikitsā.
In any case this hymn shares both the rather simplified rhetoric and the totalizing  thematics of Gotama’s hymns to the All Gods. Soma is identified with numerous224 I.91
gods (see, e.g., vss. 3, 5) and is credited with multiple cosmogonic deeds (e.g., vs.  22) and martial powers (e.g., vs. 21). Especially in the gāyatrī verses he is begged for  all sorts of aid and comradeship.
Since this is not a Soma Pavamāna hymn and is not found in the IXth Maṇḍala,  the ritual details that dominate that maṇḍala are essentially absent here. The  exception is the aforementioned triad of verses 16–18, each of which contains a  form of ā́ √pyā “swell,” an idiom used of the soaking of the soma stalks in water  to make them swell up before their pressing. As this action occurs before the puri
fication process proper, it is hardly mentioned in the IXth Maṇḍala (twice in fact,  once [IX.31.4] in an exact repetition of the present vs. 16 in a hymn attributed  to our poet Gotama Rāhūgaṇa), while it is the most prominent ritual detail in  this hymn.

Soma gives a milk-cow, Soma a swift steed, Soma a hero fit for action— one fit for the residence, for the rite, for the assembly, one who brings  fame to the forefathers—(gives these to the man) who will do ritual  service to him.
## 21
Invincible in combats, in battles a deliverer, winning the sun, winning  the waters, herdsman of the community,
born at raids, granting good dwelling and good fame, conquering—you  would we celebrate, o Soma.
## 22
You, Soma, begot all these plants here; you the waters, you the cows. You have stretched across the wide midspace; you have uncovered the  darkness with your light.
## 23
With your god(like) mind, god Soma, battle for a share of wealth for us,  mighty one.
Don’t let it hold out on you. You are master of heroism. On behalf of  both (men and gods? / singers and patrons?) be on the lookout in the  quest for cattle.
