The rel. prn. beginning pāda b, Saṃhitā yā́, is ambiguous: it can stand for yā́(neut. pl. and presumably picking up immed. preceding vīryā̀in the main cl.) or yā́ḥ (so Pp.) (fem. pl. and presumably anticipating púro dā́sīḥ in c). Neither is syntactically satisfying: if it has vīryā̀as its antecedent, as normal syntactic practice would expect, it doesn’t make sense in its clause: Indra didn’t “break into” his manly deeds. If it refers to the fortresses, it works fine with the verb in its clause but has no direct connection to the main clause. I assume the ambiguity was meant and loose subordination was the reason. I render it as a general subordinator to avoid both bad choices.
