As disc. in the publ. intro., this vs. closes the first section of the hymn, at least as I understand the structure. 140 The preverb pári appears with √hi ‘impel’ only here in the RV (and, acdg. to Mon Wms., all of Skt.). It seems to have been suggested by the pári in pāda a, construed with √bhū, in the meaning ‘encircle’. The idiom pari √hi ‘impel around’ does not make much sense, unless the image is of hótrā- compared to horses made to circle a race track. Re thinks rather that it reprises pári bhūtu in a: “l’offrande que (je ceins) autour (de vous en la) poussant” -- but this seems more trouble than it’s worth: he is forced to supply the crucial verb (je ceins: ‘gird, buckle on’) while relegating the actual verb stem hinomi to a participial adjunct (“en … poussant”).

hótrā- is of course completely -- and not very interestingly -- ambiguous between ‘libation’ and ‘invocation’.

In the last pāda Indra and Soma are compared to nṛpátī. Some interpr. (Brown, Doniger) take this as a ref. to the Aśvins, and it is true that the other three occurences of this dual refer to the Aśvins (VII.67.1, 71.4, X.106.4), as duals often do. However, I think it’s more interesting to assume that the poet is comparing these two great gods to human ‘lords of men = kings’, a sly switching of the hierarchy of roles. (Of course he just compared the gods to horses, so being compared to humans may be a step up.) I think Ge is correct in his interpr. of this simile: the gods should encourage our poetic formulations in the way that human kings do, by providing us with material goods. If nṛpátī = Aśvins, the simile doesn’t work.
