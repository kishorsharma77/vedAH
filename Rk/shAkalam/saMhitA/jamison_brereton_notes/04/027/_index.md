(323) Falcon (1-4), Falcon or Indra (5) [=Soma theft] Note the periodic punctuation by ádha (1d, 3a, 4d, 5a) -- and some play with that word: ádhi 4b, adhva... 5c, ándhah 5b, maybe adīyam 1d; also the preponderance of a-init. preverbs, ánu 1a, ápa 2a, abhí 2b, áva 3a, 3c.

The perfect jabhāra is found in vss. 2 and 4 (cf. the pres. stem forms to √bhṛ in the preceding hymn, vss. 4-7). It thus frames the central vs. 3, which could then be an omphalos. That vs. is certainly confused enough to qualify and captures the crucial moment of the grabbing of soma. But since vs. 3 consists of a series of subordinate clauses whose main clause is found in vs. 4, it cannot be syntactically isolated into a free-standing omphalos.
