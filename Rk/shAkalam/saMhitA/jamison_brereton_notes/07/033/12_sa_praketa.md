As Ge points out (n. 12a), praketá- is otherwise only a noun, and so it is best to go against the Pp’s reading praketáḥ in favor of the loc. praketé. (Ge also entertains the possibility of reading *sapraketáḥ.) The “both” are presumably both births; so Ge.

The weaving in pāda c is repeated almost verbatim from 9c, but with the single Vasiṣṭha, not the pl. Vasiṣṭhas as subject. As noted in the publ. intro., I assume that this refers to the production of the sacrifice. See comm. ad vs. 14 below.

The hapax sádāna- is not entirely clear. Ge suggests that it stands for

*sádādāna- by haplology and tr. “der … immerdar Geschenke hat.” He does not
render the utá vā, implicitly taking sahásradānaḥ … sádānaḥ as appositive adjectives.

Klein (DGRV II.169) follows Ge’s interpr. of sádānaḥ without mentioning the possible haplology and states that the conjoined terms in the phrase sahásradana utá vā sádānaḥ “come close to being synonymous.” His tr. “having a thousand gifts or having constant gifts” both illustrates this suggestion and shows how flat-footed such a phrase would be. Old discusses without coming to a conclusion, though he does reject the haplology explan., which goes back to Ludwig. My own interpr. takes the text as given and interprets the second adj. as additive “and one gift (more),” with sádāna- ‘with (a) gift’ standing for ‘with one gift’. If the utá vā should be read as disjunctive ‘or’ (as I admit it should), perhaps this is instead a version of the Archilochus fox-and-hedgehog dichotomy (“the fox knows many things, but the 41 hedgehog one big one”) -- hence “having a thousand gifts -- or one (big) gift.” This in fact is now my preferred tr. What the gifts refer to I have no idea.
