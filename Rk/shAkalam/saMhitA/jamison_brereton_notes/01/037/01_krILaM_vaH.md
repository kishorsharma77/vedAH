There are two ways to take the apparent masc. acc. phrase anarvā́ṇaṃ ratheśúbham in b. In the publ. tr. I interpret ratheśúbh- as a noun, ‘beauty on a chariot’, modified by masc. anarvā́ṇam, with the phrase an appositive to the neut.

śárdho mā́rutam in pāda a. But there are some problems with this. First, the indep.

noun śúbh- is fem. Of course, its acc. is also śúbham, and it is arguable that the bahuvrīhi adj. anarván- would make a fem. of the shape -ā́ṇam, rather than a deriv.

fem. *anarvaṇī- (acc. *-aṇīm). So the interpr. of the publ. tr. remains (barely) possible. However, the standard tr. treat the phrase as adjectival with the preceding neut. acc. This interpr. finds support in V.56.9 śárdhaṃ ratheśúbham, with masc.

śárdham, and also from VI.48.15, where masc. acc. anarvā́ṇam apparently modifies the same neut. phrase as here, but in a simile śárdho ná mā́rutam. See comm. ad loc. To construct a proper neut. for our phrase here is enough to provide the answer: *anarvá *ratheśúp is remarkably unappealing, and a slide into a form more recognizably acc. and more recognizably associated with the underlying stems is easy to understand. For anarvá- see comm. ad I.185.3.

I.37.1-2: An “improper” relative construction, with masc. pl. yé in 2a picking up śárdhaḥ ‘troop’ of 1a, which is grammatically neut. sg., though conceptually plural.
