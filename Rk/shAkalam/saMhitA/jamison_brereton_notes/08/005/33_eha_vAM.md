The publ. tr. “feathered birds, frothing at the mouth” is, to say the least, inelegant and perhaps unintelligible. What I think is meant: the birds are compared to horses (or the horses to birds); pruṣitápsavaḥ ‘frothing at the mouth’ qualifies the underlying horses and indicates their speed. Cf. the overt horses in V.75.6 áśvāsaḥ pruṣitápsavaḥ, VIII.87.5 áśvebhiḥ pruṣitápsubhiḥ (both Aśvin hymns)(latter =VIII.13.11 [Indra]).
