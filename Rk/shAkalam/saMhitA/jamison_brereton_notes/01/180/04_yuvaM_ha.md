This vs. also presents a number of difficulties. The easiest to deal with is avṛṇītam, the 2nd du. active imperfect, to the 9th class pres. to √vṛ ‘choose’, which is otherwise only middle. We should hypothetically expect middle *avṛṇāthām, but in fact, acdg. to Macdonell, no athematic present in Vedic attests such a form, whatever the present class. The 2nd /3rd ps. middle dual forms seem to have been avoided. and this active nonce form is probably modeled on 3rd singular medial impf. avṛṇīta, which is fairly common and occurs a number of times in just this metrical position, after an opening of 5 in trimeter verse. Ge (p. 258 n. 3) attributes the active voice to the fact that the Aśvins are choosing on behalf of someone else; this is an ingenious suggestion and merits consideration, but I think the formal problems tipped the balance.

The real crux in this vs. is eṣé, which has received almost as many analyses as there are RVic interpretors. For some of the various suggestions see Old ad loc., Ge’s n. 4ab, Re ÉVP XVI ad loc., Scar (60-61), Keydana (Inf. 236 n. 135); there is no space (and I have no patience) to discuss them all here. I take it as a dat. inf. to √iṣ ‘send’ + ā́, built directly to the root. This root identification may be supported by vs. 6 of the next hymn, I.181.6b pūrvī́r íṣaḥ … mádhva iṣṇán “sending many refreshing drinks of honey,” with similar sense.

I take the simile apó ná kṣódaḥ as obj. of this inf., parallel to the gharma drink that the Aśvins are sending here. With Gr, I take apáḥ as one of the rare sg. forms of áp- ‘water’, preserved here in what is almost a deconstructed compound. For the gen. with kṣódaḥ cf. I.112.12 kṣódasā-udnáḥ “with a gush of water.” As for the 2nd hemistich, against the standard interpr. (incl. Old), I take cd as a single clause. I supply “refreshing drinks” (íṣaḥ) as subj. of práti yanti with mádhvaḥ dependent on it (not a nom. pl., per Gr), on the basis of the phrase cited above from
