I analyse prā́gāt as pra-ágāt, rather than Pp. prá agāt -- in other words with an accented verb, which is in a non overtly marked subordinate clause, with adhāyi in the main clause. I then supply the same verb again in b. This may seem over-tricky, but it avoids taking smát … mánma as a parenthesis and ties together the two ritual actions, the procession of the horse and the production of the poem.
