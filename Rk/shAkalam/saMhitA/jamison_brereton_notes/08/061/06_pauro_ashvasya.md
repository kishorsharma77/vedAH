Although paurá- is generally a PN in the RV (see Mayrhofer, Die Personenname in der Ṛgveda-Saṃhitā s.v.), reflecting the patronymic it is morphologically, here it cannot be so meant. Among other things, Indra cannot be a descendent of Puru! In this passage it puns on purukṛ́t in the same pāda, as well as purūvaso in 3a, purū́in 8a. Ge’s tr. takes account of this word play (“Mehrer der Rossherde”), but I don’t think that it should be construed with a genitive as he takes it. I take both genitives (áśvasya … gávām) with purukṛ́t (so also Scar 76) and interpret paurá- as ‘stemming from / related to much(ness)’, that is, ‘muchness itself’; “multiplicity … multiplier” is an attempt to capture the pun in English without undue awkwardness.

In c Ge (also Old) takes dā́nam as subject: “bei dir bleibt die Gabe niemals aus,” but the verbal forms to √mṛdh are otherwise always transitive. Old cites VII.59.4 as parallel, but the parallelism is only apparent and the verb there is also transitive.
