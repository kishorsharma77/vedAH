The gen. asya of pāda a could depend instead on viśé - or indeed on both viśé and śárma. Since I don’t know what ‘clan’ is in question, it is hard to determine if it belongs to Soma.

On dhā́ma … vyānaśe, see comm. ad vs. 5. I do not think, with Ge, that the dhā́man- refers to the first “form” of soma in the phases of soma-preparation.

In d note the play in the phrase sáṃ yāti saṃyátaḥ, which belong to different roots (√yā and √yat respectively). The latter has been rendered in quite different ways: Ge: “… gelangt er zu allen Stufenfolgen”; Re “il parcourt toutes les confluences”; Lü (702) “… geht er zu allen Treffpunkten”; Scar (404) Nomen act.

‘feste Aufstellung’. But saṃyát- is generally an adj., usually in the pl. of liquids (V.34.9 ā́paḥ saṃyátaḥ, VIII.100.9); esp. pertinent are two passages in our own hymn: vs. 18 in the next tṛca saṃyátam pipyúṣīm íṣam “continuous, swelling refreshment” and, by implication, in vs. 47 dhā́rāḥ … saṃyátaḥ “continuous streams.” On the basis of these passages, I supply “streams” here as well. See, e.g., vs. 8.
