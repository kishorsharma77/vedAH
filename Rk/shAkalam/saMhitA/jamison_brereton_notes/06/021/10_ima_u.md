Like 1b, pāda c here contains an extravagant etymological figure based again on √hvā ‘call’: hávam (ā́) huvató huvānáḥ.

The phrasing of d also seems awkwardly pleonastic -- ná tvā́vām̐anyáḥ .. tvád asti “no one like you exists, other than you” -- in comparison with the usual expression, found in nearby VI.30.4 ná tvā́vām̐anyó asti “there exists no one else like you” (cf. VII.32.23).
