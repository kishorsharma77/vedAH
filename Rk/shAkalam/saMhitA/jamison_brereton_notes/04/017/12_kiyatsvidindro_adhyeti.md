The exact sense of ádhy eti is not entirely clear. It generally means ‘study’ from the literal meaning ‘go over’ (matching the English idiom exactly), but shows various semantic developments: ‘give thought to, take cognizance of, be mindful of, trouble oneself with’, etc. In all cases, the lexeme ádhi √i has a mental sense (though III.54.9 has a secondary literal reading): I.71.10, 80.15; III.54.9; V.44.13; VII.56.15; VIII.83.7, 91.3; IX.67.31, 32; X.33.7, 32.3, 100.4. Here I think we should read the expression in the light of vs. 4, with its apparent uncertainty about Indra’s parentage

-- esp. given 4a janitā́and 4c yáḥ … jajā́na, matched here by janitúr yó jajā́na.

I take the rel. cl. of cd with the following vs. The two share the verb íyarti, and 12cd can serve as the cause of 13a: when Indra raises a tempest, he destroys the man’s peace.

I take muhukaíḥ as a temporal adverbial instr., expressing how suddenly Indra can erupt -- even though I have revised my view on muhuké in the preceding hymn (IV.16.17 -- see comm. there). I do not think “raises his tempest with/by sudden skirmishes” is what is meant here.
