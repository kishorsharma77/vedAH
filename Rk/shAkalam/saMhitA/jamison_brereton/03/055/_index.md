All Gods  
Prajāpati Vaiśvāmitra or Prajāpati Vācya  
22 verses: triṣṭubh  
The most obvious feature of this hymn is the refrain found in every verse: “great  is the one and only lordship of the gods,” notable for its emphasis on unity  (ékam “one and only” is the final word of each verse) and for the juxtaposition  and implied identity of asura(tvám) “lord(ship)” and devā́nām “gods,” given  that in later Vedic the Asuras and the Devas are locked in eternal enmity. This  familiar Vedic mystery of simultaneous unity and diversity is further exempli  
fied by the references to numerous gods (generally unnamed, but usually recog nizable), especially in the second part of the hymn, in the manner of many All  God hymns.  
However, the hymn has a more structured trajectory than most All God list  hymns. The first part of the hymn treats the mystery of the birth of Agni; once  Agni has been definitively born, Indra comes to the sacrifice as is usual. After  three verses situating the action at a re-creation of the primordial early-morning  sacrifice and introducing the poet (vss. 1–3), the hymn turns to a mystical  description of fire dispersed in many places and hidden in the plants (4–5), and  of its parents, the two kindling sticks (4–7), then of fire as it catches after the  kindling (8–9) and sends its smoke and flames toward heaven (9–10). The kin dling of Agni then takes on both a cosmic and a ritual dimension, as Night and  Dawn and then the Dawns alone are identified as the mother(s) of the infant  Agni, reflecting, of course, the kindling of the ritual fire at daybreak (11–16).  Soon after (17–18) Indra puts in an appearance, coming to the early-morning  sacrifice.  
Not all the referents are clear in these riddling verses, and in some verses several  referents probably lurk beneath the enigmatic phraseology. For example, verse 17  serves as a transition verse between the fire-kindling verses and the appearance of  Indra. The bull here could be Agni himself, or Soma (much of the vocabulary is544 III.55  
somian), or a prefiguring of Indra. Commentators differ in their identifications,  and those given in brackets here are sometimes provisional.
