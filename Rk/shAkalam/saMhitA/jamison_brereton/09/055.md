Soma Pavamāna
Avatsāra Kāśyapa
4 verses: gāyatrī
The first three verses of the hymn are unified by a reference to the stalk (ándhas) of  the soma plant, although the role of the stalk is somewhat vague. Verse 1 is notable  for its mention of agriculture, though again the relevance is not entirely clear. The  martial Soma is on display in verse 4.
## 1
Stream around to us grain upon grain, fruiting upon fruiting with your stalk, o Soma, and all the gifts of good fortune.
## 2
O drop, just as there is praise of you (now), just as (the honey) has been  born from your stalk,
(so) sit down on the dear ritual grass.
## 3
And as cow-finder for us, horse-finder, purify yourself, Soma, with your stalk through the days soonest to come.
## 4
Who conquers and is not conquered, who smashes his rival on just  confronting him—
as such a one, purify yourself, o winner of thousands.
