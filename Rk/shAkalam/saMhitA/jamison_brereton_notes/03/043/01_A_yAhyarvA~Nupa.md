The standard tr. take úpa barhíḥ with the next pāda (“call you to the ritual grass”); Sāy. agrees with my version (see Ge’s n. 1c). There is no principled way to decide, and very little depends on it.

It is not easily possible to register the pun of havya(vā́haḥ) ‘oblation’ (to √hu ‘pour’) and havante (to √hvā ‘call’).
