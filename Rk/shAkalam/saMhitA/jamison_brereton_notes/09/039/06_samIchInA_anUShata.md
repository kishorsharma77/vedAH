As disc. in the publ. intro., this vs. forms a notional ring with vs. 1, with both containing direct speech in a ritual setting in their respective pāda c’s. The speech is more clearly marked in vs. 1, with íti brávan, than it is here. Both the speaker(s) and the addressees are also unclear here. It is likely that the former are the officiating priests, the subjects of the 3rd pl. hinvanti in b and quite possibly of anūṣata in a (so Ge, Lü 602), though Re thinks rather of the soma drinks. As for the addressees of the 2nd pl. impv. sīdata, I think the soma drinks are most likely, as in the identical pāda in IX.13.9, which is preceded by a nom. pl. pávamānāḥ identifying the subject. However, the soma referent in our b pāda is sg.

(hárim) -- though this is not really problematic, given the ubiquitous variation between sg.

and pl. soma(s) in these hymns. However, it could also be addressed to the gods arriving at the ritual ground (so Sāy), the gods whose location was specified in 1c.
