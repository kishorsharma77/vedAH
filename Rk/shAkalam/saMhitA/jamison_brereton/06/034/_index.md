Indra  
Śunahotra Bhāradvāja  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first verse of this hymn is a remarkably condensed expression of the poetic  economy:  Indra is both the recipient of praise songs and the source of inspira tion for those poetic thoughts. Moreover, all poets, past and present, vie to attract  Indra’s attention, each with his own poem. The rest of the hymn develops these  thoughts. Verses 2–3 continue the theme of multiple poets focusing on a single  object, Indra, and then provide a transition to the final two verses (4–5), which  celebrate the benefits that Indra receives from praise and sacrifice in a manner that  indicates that our praise and sacrifice are happening now.
