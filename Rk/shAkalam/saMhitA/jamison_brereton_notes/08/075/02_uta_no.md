This is the only occurrence of śrád- outside the inherited univerbated idiom śrád √dhā ‘trust/put trust in’. As I have discussed elsewhere, ‘trust’ is often specifically trust in the efficacy of the sacrifice, and I think that’s the meaning being tapped here: realize our trust in the sacrifice’s success with tangible results.
