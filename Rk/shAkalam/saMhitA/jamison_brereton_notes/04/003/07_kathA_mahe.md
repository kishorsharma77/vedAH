On the benevolent Rudra see comm. ad vss. 5-8. It is not clear why or how Rudra is the giver of the oblation. Old (see also WG’s n.) suggests that it is in his capacity as paśupati-: he provides the beast for sacrifice. This is possible: though he is not so called in the RV (where the word is not found), this epithet is applied to him in AV (e.g., XI.2.28) and VS (e.g., XXVI.28).

In c rétaḥ ‘semen’ is somewhat surprising, esp. if it is to be construed as the object of brávaḥ -- so much so that Gr (tr., not Wö.) suggested emendation to répaḥ ‘stain’, an emendation accepted by Old (SBE, Noten) and Lü (622) and maintained tentatively by Scar (214). Re keeps the transmitted form but interprets it as a way of referring to negative speech: “Quelle semence (de blâme dirais-tu) …?” But in a culture so fixated on fertility, semen is basically always a positive concept. Important is the fact noted by Ge (n. 7c) that Viṣṇu is elsewhere the protector of semen (cf., e.g., VII.36.9 víṣṇuṃ niṣiktapā́m “Viṣṇu, protector of the poured-out [semen]”). In his n.

(and contra his tr.) Re suggests an alternative interpr. of rétaḥ here as a truncated

*retodhe (cf. retodhā́- 5x) or *retode (Re does not accent either proposed form). This
seems the correct solution, with the -de extracted from havirdé, which ended the preceding pāda.

In d Re suggests that śárave bṛhatyaí is the “état pré-compositionnel” of a bahuvrīhi *bṛhatśarave (no accent provided and no application of sandhi), whose referent is Rudra. Although the arrow is surely Rudra’s as all standard interpr.

recognize, there is no reason to substitute the god for his symbolic accoutrement. Just as Agni can speak to the chariot of the Aśvins (6c, by my interpr.), he can also speak to Rudra’s arrow.

Ge (n. 7d) points out the contrast between Viṣṇu as creator (c) and Rudra as destroyer (d).
