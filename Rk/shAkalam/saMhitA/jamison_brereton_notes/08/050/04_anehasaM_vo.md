The two verses differ from each other almost entirely, except that the openings of the first two pādas are identical: anehásam (a), mádhvaḥ (b). Still, reference to 49.4 aids in the interpretation of this verse: in 49.4 the referent of anehásam is clearly soma; here that is less immediately clear, but surely correct.

See Old for considerable discussion of this verse, though without reaching firm conclusions.
