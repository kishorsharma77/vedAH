The part. pínvamānā is repeated from 4b, with a small twist of phraseology: Sarasvatī swelling with the rivers, rather than the rivers swelling as in 4b.

The syntactic status of the various gods in bcd is unclear. Are they all separate subjects of ā́gamiṣṭhaḥ (so Re)? Or should we supply other verbs? Ge supplies “sei” with cd, but keeps b with a, implicitly making Sarasvatī another subj. of ā́gamiṣṭhaḥ.

Or is this just the beginning of an All God list, with no predicates required -- or feeding into the next tṛca inviting the All Gods to come here?
