The vs. begins with a most unusual sandhi: párītó ṣiñcatā. Ge (n. 1a; cf. ZDMG 65: 307) suggests that it is Prakritizing. Old and Re, less dramatically, consider it to be based on IX.63.10 párīto vāyáve sutám, where the sandhi of itás is correct. (Ge also cites this vs.) Re points out that that vs. ends with siñcata and suggests that the unusual sandhi here “résulte de l’assemblage des extrémités du v.

63,10.” Although the invocation of 63.10 seems apposite, it doesn’t entirely explain the sandhi we find here. The -o of párītó can be explained as the adoption of this word sequence from its position before vd. C in 63.10, but the retroflexion in ṣiñcatā does not follow. In fact, in 63.10, though siñcata occurs after -u (vā́reṣu siñcata), there is no ruki-induced retroflexion over morpheme boundary (nor do we expect it).

Instead I think we must explain the retroflexion as an effect of the preverb pári. By far the greatest number of the retroflexed initials of this root occur immediately after pári, esp. the passive stem (pari) ṣicyá- (15 exx.), but also the ppl. páriṣikta- (8x); see also, in the next hymn (IX.108.7), our exact 2nd pl. act. impv. pári ṣiñcata. There is also retroflexion after the preverb ní (5+), and after the particles tū́(2x) and hí (1x). All of these are contact-induced, unlike our example, where the preverb is separated from the verb. Under these circumstances, there is ordinarily no retroflexion (see pári … siñcata X.32.5, pári … siktáḥ IX.97.15). However, here I think either the numerous exx. of pári √ṣic in IX (15+) imposed distant retroflexion here where it was phonologically unmotivated, or an unretroflexed initial was changed redactionally under the influence of pári ṣiñcata in the next hymn.
