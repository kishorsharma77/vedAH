Mitra and Varuṇa
Urucakri Ātreya
4 verses: gāyatrī
The most interesting question about this hymn is why Mitra and Varuṇa are here  called Rudras, and the most interesting verse is the mysterious final one. Rudra is a  healer but also a terrifying archer, and the purpose of the poet may be to make sure  that the vengeance of Mitra and Varuṇa, which is like the fury of Rudra, be turned  against his enemies. Mitra and Varuṇa should protect and rescue him and direct  their anger toward the Dasyus, not toward him (vs. 3).
This observation may help us understand the last verse, although its mean ing remains uncertain. As also in IV.3.13, we read the beginning of pāda a as mā́ akásya, rather than mā́ kásya with the Padapāṭha and most other interpreters. The  fear expressed in ab, then, is that the poet will be destroyed and thereby become a  nonentity. This fear is not only for the present, but also for the future. In pāda c the  poet asks that after death he not become a nobody, a nonentity, but that in heaven  his remains form a new body and that on earth his life continue in his lineage.
