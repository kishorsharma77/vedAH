The du. mitrā́is used in two different senses: on the one hand, in its appellative sense it refers to the two gods as allies; on the other mitrā́is a pregnant dual PN, meaning “Mitra (and Varuṇa),” with the “and Varuṇa” then pleonastically supplied in pāda b in an “X and which Y” construction (váruṇo yáś ca).

Most take tánā as another dual (to thematic tána-), but struggle to interpr. it. I take it as the instr. sg. of the root noun tán- and in this context as indicating the “(home) stretch” of a race course. The image is of two charioteers running neck and neck and therefore evenly matched.

tánayā of course echoes tánā, though it belongs to a different stem (whichever interpr. of tánā is followed). In this case I accept the general interpr. as du. to tánaya-.
