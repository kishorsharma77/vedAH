Pāda a could also mean “the king has donned his garment of the rivers,” but IX.86.33, which also opens rā́jā síndhūnām, where the constituency is clear, eliminates that possibility.

Note the chiastic #rā́jā … rájiṣṭhām# opening and closing the first hemistich.

Pāda d contains one of the paradoxes beloved of RVic bards. The identities of the subj.s and obj.s of the two duhé are disputed. Old, for ex., thinks that Father Heaven yields Soma in the first clause, while Soma yields Dawn in the second - because pitúr jā́m in X.3.2 refers to Dawn. But this seems to take us too far afield: the strict parallelism of the two mini-clauses—duhá īm pitā́/ duhá īm pitúr jā́m— sketches a closed loop, and introducing an entity not already implicit in the discourse seems unlikely. Ge’s interpr. (n. 2d) seems closer. The subj. of the first duhé is in my opinion Heaven (dyaúṣ pitā́), with half of his name represented by pitā́and the other found earlier in the simile divó ná vṛṣṭíḥ “like the rain from heaven.” This simile is also the clue to the identity of the object: soma as rain. Then this soma/rain is the subject of the 2nd duhé; it yields soma itself, in the form of the plant whose growth is due to rain. This soma(plant) or the soma juice itself can also be reckoned as the “offspring of his father,” namely of Heaven. This could be a reference to the heavenly soma or simply to the soma juice assimilated to rain.
