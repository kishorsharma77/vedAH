Dawn (1–15), Aśvins (16–18)
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
18 verses: jagatī 1–4, triṣṭubh 5–12, uṣṇih 13–18
This metrically complex structure with two different dedicands must originally have  consisted of several independent hymns—probably, with Oldenberg, verses 1–4,  5–8, 9–12, 13–15, 16–18, all but the last dedicated to Dawn. Indeed, the first two  segments (vss. 1–4 in jagatī, 5–8 in triṣṭubh) appear to be partial variants of each  other, the first describing multiple Dawns (except vs. 4), the second a single Dawn.  There are precise agreements in lexicon, phraseology, and imagery, particularly  between verses 1–2 and 5–6, that go beyond standard shared Dawn vocabulary. The  seductive dancing girl of verse 4 also reminds of the smiling siren of verse 6. The  third segment (vss. 9–12) has fewer connections with the first two, but is themati cally unified, especially by the emphasis on “diminishing/belittling” (all expressed  by the root mī in different combinations) in verses 10–12.
All three of the segments in trimeter meter (that is, through vs. 12) contain arrest ing images, and the poet enjoys exploiting ambiguities to poetic effect. In verses 1  and 12, for example, he uses different syntactic constructions in the simile and the  frame because the verb held in common by both can be either reflexive or transitive;  in verse 3 the pun inherent in the root arc (both “shine” and “chant”) allows the  introduction of a simile involving female work-songs, though the dawns themselves  are presumably not chanting.
The last two segments, in uṣṇih meter, to Dawn and the Aśvins respectively (vss.  13–15, 16–18), are, not surprisingly, less complex. Both hope for the arrival of the  divinities at the sacrifice, accompanied by plenty of presents.
