Indra and Agni
Atri Bhauma
6 verses: anuṣṭubh, except virāṭpūrvā 6
Although Agni and Indra separately receive the largest number of R̥gvedic hymns  of any of the gods, they have little to do with each other conceptually or ritu ally, and the relatively few hymns they share (eleven in all) tend either to be banal,  boiler-plate hymns without much content, or else ones favoring one or the other of  the gods. There are elements of both types in this hymn. On the one hand, Indra  and Agni are invoked as a pair through much of the hymn with fairly all-purpose  phraseology. On the other, the two exploits described (in 1cd and the very difficult  3cd, the middle of the hymn) are Indraic: the first a clear reference to the Vala myth,  though with Trita, not Indra, as hero; the second a reference to the Vr̥tra myth, with  some curious features, especially the unidentified wooden object.
