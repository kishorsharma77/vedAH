The object of the verb práti gṛbhṇāti in the frame, which would correspond to the rivers in the simile, is not expressed. Ge (/WG) supplies “die Somaströme,” Re “chants.” Given the liquid nature of the simile, Ge’s suggestion seems the most likely.

Unfortunately most of the examples of ví √śri are used of the opening of the divine doors in Āprī hymns, so there is no formulaic material to aid in determining what to supply. The phrase yudhmá ójasā is repeated in 5b and ójasā alone in 6b, both in the same metrical position.
