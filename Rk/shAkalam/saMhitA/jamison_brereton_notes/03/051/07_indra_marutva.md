This vs. contains yet another implicit contrast between the aor. and pres. of √pā ‘drink’: pāhi … yáthā … ápibaḥ. See comm. ad III.35.10, 36.3, 40.1-2, and 47.3.

It is not clear whether a contrast is also meant between the acc. sómam with pāhi (also 8a) and the (potentially partitive) genitive sutásya with ápibaḥ and, if so, whether it is signaling some sort of aspectual distinction.

The verb ā́vivāsanti lacks an object here, though it usually is construed with one. Ge (/WG) interpret it as ‘invite’ (presumably supplying ‘you’), while Re supplies the gods as object. I think the object slot has been intentionally left blank: with Indra’s guidance and in his shelter they hope to win whatever they fancy, hence my somewhat awk. tr. “seek their win.” Oberlies (Rel.RV I.403) suggests that this is a poetic contest, but I don’t see any evidence of this beyond the plural.

Given the usual rendering of kaví- elsewhere in the publ. tr., I would change the tr. here to ‘sage poets’ or just ‘poets’.
