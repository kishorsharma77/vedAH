As often, vā ‘or’ doesn’t present two balanced choices, but could be paraphrased as “or, to put it another way…” That is, it rephrases and varies (often substantially) a previous statement or question.

The first and last pādas contain forms of mánas-, which I have tr. differently.

The first, in the phrase mánaso várāya, is idiomatic in English as “heart’s desire,” not “mind’s desire/choice/wish.” The expression in the last pāda, kéna … mánasā, might better be rendered “in what spirit,” though I’ve chosen to stick closer to the ‘mind’ sense.

The pf. of √āp can be used presentially (so also Kü, though not with ref. to this passage), and that value works best here: the focus in all four clauses is what we can do to best serve Agni, not what someone has done in the past.
