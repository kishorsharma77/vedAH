párijrayaḥ seems almost like a univerbation of a prepositional/adverbial phrase pári *jráyaḥ “around the (broad) expanse.” It is even possible that one of the forms in this vs. is meant to represent the adverbial phrase -- so, possibly, ab “forth (go your chariots) around the expanse,” referring to the Maruts’ circling the earth or the midspace -- while the other is a nom. pl. (by old haplology), to be rendered as in the publ. tr.: “the waters swirling in their stream bed.” This would alleviate the clunkiness of the repetition, which would then be only apparent. As Ge. remarks (n. 2c), “Trita's Beziehung zu den Marut ist dunkel.” Trita is associated with the Maruts also in II.34.10, 14. In vs. 10 of that hymn Trita seems to be associated with making noise, as here; that is as far as I can get.
