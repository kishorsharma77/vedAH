In c I construe dat. adhvarā́ya with sādhú, giving the latter richer semantics than the mere adverbial “richtig” of Ge or even Re’s “correctement.” Found twice in 42 (1d, 5a), adhvará- reappears here, though the word is too common to make much of this.

As noted above ad 42.3, our pāda d seems to be a clearer expression of the image of the increasing flames of the ritual fire found also in 42.3b.
