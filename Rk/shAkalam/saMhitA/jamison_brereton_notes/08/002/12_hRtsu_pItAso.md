A peculiar ending to a celebration of soma, presumably describing some of the potential side-effects of (over-)indulgence in soma.

With Ge (implicitly) I take ū́dhar as belonging not to ‘udder’, but to a homonymous stem ‘cold’, with Avestan cognate (OA, YA aodar-). See EWA s.v. ū́dhan-. The same ‘cold’ sense is found also in V.34.3 and as a pun in X.61.9. But compare Old, who finds a complex way to rescue ‘udder’, though not one sufficently plausible to me, anyway. See also disc. ad IX.107.20.
