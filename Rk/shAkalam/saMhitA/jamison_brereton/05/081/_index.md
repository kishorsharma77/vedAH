Savitar  
Śyāvāśva Ātreya  
5 verses: jagatī  
The Anukramaṇī attributes both this and the next hymn, also to Savitar, to Śyāvāśva,  the poet of the Marut cycle in this maṇḍala, and indeed the poet names himself at  the end of the last verse (5). However, the subject of Savitar does not seem to have  inspired him to the same poetic heights as the Maruts did. The hymn depicts Savitar  as a power in the cosmos (especially vss. 2–5), but also as a poet and distributor of  benefits to mortals (1–2ab).
