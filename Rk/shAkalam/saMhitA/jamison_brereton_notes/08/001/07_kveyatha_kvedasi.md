On iyatha (rather than iyetha) see Kü (100), following Hoffmann 1976: 553 n. 3.

The verse contains several unexpressed presuppositions. The anxious questions in pāda a are explained by the statement in b: we ask where Indra is because we know his mind is in many places. With Ge I take álarṣi in c also as a question, again explained by d: they have sung to you, so are you coming? Pāda c contains a heavy, accentless vocative phrase: yudhma khajakṛt puraṃdara, the last two of whose members contain object-governing compounds.

The long (12-syl.) third pāda of bṛhatī nicely accommodates such iterations.
