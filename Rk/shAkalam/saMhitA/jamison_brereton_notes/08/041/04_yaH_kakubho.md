The hapax sáptya- is problematic. Most (though not Ge) take it as a derivative of saptá ‘7’ (e.g., Re ‘la septuplicité’, a fine coinage) and point to Varuṇa’s 7 sisters in 2e. His control over the 7 in 9e is perhaps more relevant. Ge tr.

“treue Freundschaft”; though he does not comment, he must derive it from sápti-, though the standard view of the meaning of the latter is now ‘team’ and those meanings seem quite distinct. If the word belongs with sápti-, which I think more likely than a connection with saptá (though 9e now gives me pause), it should mean something like ‘teamwork, cooperation’. The problem is that in this hymn Varuṇa is credited with doing everything on his own; his usual companions, Mitra and Aryaman, are absent. I therefore tentatively suggest that it is based on a syncopated form (sa-pti-) from a putative *sa-páti-, hence ‘joint leadership/lordship’ à ‘leadership, master-ship’. This is a very fragile suggestion, I realize.
