The gen. phrase vāmásya vásunaḥ in b is difficult to construe. Ge supplies “(Spender)” as its head noun; my tr. assumes that it is a loose genitive specification of the paśú- that is lurking in the -kṣú- in the bahuvrīhi puru-kṣú- ‘possessing much livestock’. This interpr. is suggested by the other occurrence of this gen. phrase in VIII.1.31 utá vāmásya vásunaś ciketati, yó ásti yā́dvaḥ paśúḥ “of the valuable goods what will stand out is the livestock coming from Yadu,” where the vāmá- vásu- is identified as a particular paśú-. But the syntax proposed for our passage is sketchy.

By accent rā́yaḥ should be nom. pl., not, as I have tr. it, gen. sg. As Ge suggests in his n. 5c, it reads literally “the paths, the riches …” Nonetheless, Old (ZDMG 55.324 and Noten) considers the nom. pl. reading “forced” (gezwungen) and interprets it as a gen. sg. (on the basis in part of VII.18.3 pathyā̀rāyáḥ with a clear gen. sg.). In the ZDMG treatment he explicitly says that emending the accent isn’t necessary, though he doesn’t indicate why.

In d Ge suggests a haplology of *samudréṇa ná, with an instr. rather than a loc., as in III.36.7 samudréṇa síndhavo yā́damānāḥ, where he proposes a similar haplology. This is possible, but not nec.: I see no reason why rivers can’t unite in the sea as well as with it. As for III.36.7 see comm. ad loc.; I do not think that a simile particle is necessary there.
