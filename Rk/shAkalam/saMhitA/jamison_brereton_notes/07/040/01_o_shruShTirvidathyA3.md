The standard interpr. take vidathyā̀as nom. sg. fem. modifying śruṣṭíḥ (e.g., Thieme [Unters. 48] “die zur Verteilung führende Erhörung”), and this is certainly the default reading. However, it leaves the sám in the VP sám etu with little to do, and I wonder if vidathyā̀is not instead an instr. sg. fem., which would justify the lexeme sám √i ‘come together’. This adj. modifies vā́c- in I.167.3, and “hearing” and “ceremonial (speech)” would make a nice pair. The speech would also stimulate the praise (stómam) we aim at the gods in the next pāda.

In b I take práti … dadhīmahi in its idiomatic sense, ‘to fix an arrow (on a bowstring), to aim’, though a more generic one (Ge ‘anheben’, Re ‘commencer’) is hardly out of the question. 65 In d ratnínaḥ ‘possessing treature’ is perfectly ambiguous: it can be a gen. sg.

and modify asya (standing for Bhaga) or a nom. pl. modifying the 1st pl. subj. of syā́ma. In the publ. tr. I take it as the former (as does Thieme loc. cit.), while Ge and Re take it as the latter (though Re recants in his notes, deciding that the gen. sg. is better, on the basis of ratna-bhā́j- VII.81.4). In fact, I think it’s probably meant to be both, with the nom. pl. a proleptic use, and would now emend the tr. to “may we, possessing [=acquiring] treasure, be at the apportioning of him who possesses treasures.” Gr (s.v. ratnín-), Ge, Re, and Thieme (loc. cit.) all take the referent of asya to be Savitar, and the presence of unaccented asya, which should refer to someone/- thing already in the discourse, supports this interpr. However, since the next hymn (VII.41) is entirely devoted to Bhaga as distributor of goods and since vibhāgé appears to be a pun on his name, I think Bhaga is equally plausible. The lack of accent on asya could be accounted for by this pun.
