On first glance this verse appears to contain a mā́prohibitive with a subjunctive karat (so tr. Ge), which would be grammatically quite anomalous.

Hoffmann (1967: 92) claims that in the Sprachgefühl karat is an injunctive, but this seems extremely unlikely to me because the root aor. of √kr̥is one of the best attested of such formations, and though the stem kára- is well established, there is no evidence that it is not interpreted as a subjunctive. There's no augmented ákara- for example, and no thematic part. *kárant- or *káramāṇa-. I therefore take pāda a as an independent clause, with gapped prohibitive copula (“don’t be”) with mā́. Since the root √as doesn't form injunctives (or an aorist), there is in fact no way to make a prohibitive copular sentence in any other way.

As noted in the intro., I think this may be a reference to the instituting of the Third Pressing, which happens in the evening. The point may be that sacrificers who fail to have a Third Pressing risk losing the presence of a disgruntled Indra to those who do.

I do not entirely understand the social relations depicted in c. Ordinarily, in patrilocal marriage the son-in-law would be at a distance anyway; that is, the wife would be living with her husband’s family. Is this a reference to an in-comer, a husband who lives with his wife’s family because he's too poor and who then makes it worse by distancing himself — or to the return of a bride because the husband was too feckless? Or is this similar to the situation in the Gambler’s Lament (X.34), where the husband loses his wife because of his gambling or other economically ruinous activities? In d “down on his luck” translates aśrīrá-, which phonologically resembles the characteristic offering of the Third Pressing, the ā́śir- ‘milk-mixture’. It thus indirectly hints at the Third Pressing theme.
