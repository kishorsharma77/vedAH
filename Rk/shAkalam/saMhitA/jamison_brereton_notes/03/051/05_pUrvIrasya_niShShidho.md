The stem niṣṣídh- and related forms are difficult (see, inter alia, Scar 596- 97). As Scar points out, there is no obvious direct way to connect it with either √sādh ‘succeed’ or √sidh ‘repel’, and neither of these roots appears with níḥ in the RV (though the latter does in post-RVic texts, but without relevant meaning; see Gotō, 1st Kl., 328). On the other hand, the semantic range of the word itself in context is relatively clear. It usually refers to something offered by inferiors to superiors.

Ge’s Tribut (see his brief disc. in n. 5b) works pretty well. If we want to connect it to the root √sādh ‘succeed, realize, reach the goal’, it may be seen as the material representation of the fulfillment (this is the √sādh part) of an obligation, and the níḥ ‘forth’ may reflect the proffering of these material goods.

I supply ‘streams’ with jīráyaḥ on the basis of the other occurrence of this pl.

in II.17.3 prá jīráyaḥ sisrate … as well as the well-attested jīrá-dānu- ‘possessing lively drops’. There is general agreement in the standard tr. that jīrí- refers to flowing water.
