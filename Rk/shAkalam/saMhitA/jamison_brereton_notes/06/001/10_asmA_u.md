The doubling of the 2nd sg. enclitic te by init. asmaí, the here-and-now demonstrative, is somewhat unusual, though in the same general vein as táṃ tvā (2c, 6c, 7a).

Ge and Re (see also Klein I.329, Oberlies II.133) take védī as a loc., but in this passage, embedded in a long series of instrumentals, there seems no reason not to interpr. it as the instr. it appears to be. See AiG III.155, where Wack identifies it as an instr. here. The very similar passage VI.13.4 yás te sūno sahaso gīrbhír ukthaíḥ … vedyā́naṭ (that is, probably to be emended to *védyā́naṭ and analyzed *védyā …), supports the instr. interpr. -- which is argued for for both passages by Bloomfield (RR ad VI.1.10) and Old (Noten ad VI.13.4).

Re (see also Klein I.52, 71) take bhāsā́, śrávobhiś ca as a conjoined NP, with Re putting immediately following śravasyàḥ into a separate syntagm (Klein doesn’t treat anything but the two nouns). Although ca does generally conjoin nominals, both the pāda break between the instrumentals and the etymological figure śrávobhiḥ … śravasyàḥ suggest that the two instr. belong with different parts of the clause.
