This vs. is a reprise of and variation on vs. 1. Like vs. 1, it treats the rewards that accrue to verbal praise, and in fact repeats two of the three types of verbal products found in vs. 1 (bráhma 1a/3b, dhíyaḥ 1d/3c), with stómam (1c) and hávanāni (3d) being the novel terms. bráhma and hávanāni are modified by bahuvrīhis that express the material reward they will obtain (‘all goods’ [viśvápsu] and ‘cattle as bounty’ [gómaghā] respectively). In the c pāda the chariot motif of 1a returns in slightly different form: we “team up” our insights, as Indra does his teams (niyútaḥ) -- the teams that, pulling his chariot (cf., e.g., I.135.4 rátho niyútvān), will bring Indra and his bounty to the sacrifice, where the “teams” of insights will be exchanged for the goods he brings.

On viśvápsu- see comm. ad I.148.1.
