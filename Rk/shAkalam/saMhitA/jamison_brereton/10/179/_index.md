Indra
Śibi Auśīnara (1), Pratardana Daivodāsi (2), Vasumanas Rauhidaśva (3) 3 verses: anuṣṭubh 1, triṣṭubh 2–3
This hymn is later used for the dadhi-gharma (sour milk and hot milk) oblation at  the midday libation associated with the Pravargya ritual, and indeed, unlike many  R̥gvedic passages pressed into service in middle Vedic śrauta rituals, it seems to have  been composed for just this purpose. The first verse invites the priests to assess the  readiness of the libation; the second and third verses, later the Puro'nuvākyā and  Yājyā respectively, invite Indra to the midday service and offer him the cooked por
tion, clearly identified in verse 3c.
