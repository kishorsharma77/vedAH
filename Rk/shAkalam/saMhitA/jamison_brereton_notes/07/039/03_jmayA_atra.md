There is almost universal agreement that jmayā́represents an adverbial instr. of exactly that shape, despite the hiatus, rather than Pp. jmayā́ḥ. See, e.g., Old, Re, Scar 421, with lit.

With Sāy., cited by Ge, the Maruts must be the referents of śubhrā́ḥ in b: pl.

forms of this adj. generally modify the Maruts, and the midspace is especially associated with them.

Note that marjayanta must be reflexive, with real medial value, rather than being a straight transitive -anta replacement of the type commonly found with -áyaformations.

On urujrayaḥ see comm. ad V.54.2.

Assuming the Agni is the messenger in d (so, e.g., Ge), this vs. contains both standard models of the sacrifice: “the gods come to the sacriifice” and “the sacrifice goes to the gods.”
