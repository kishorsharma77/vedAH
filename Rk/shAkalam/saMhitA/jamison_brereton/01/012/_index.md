Agni  
Medhātithi Kāṇva  
12 verses: gāyatrī  
This simple hymn has a high proportion of pādas repeated from other hymns, and  in some ways seems to have been assembled rather than composed. It touches on  the standard characteristics and roles of Agni: messenger, priest, and poet, con veyor of the gods to the sacrifice, and protector and benefactor of men. There is  essentially no description of fire; the focus is entirely on the ritual.
