As noted in the publ. intro., the three footsteps (trī́ṇi padā́ni) attributed to the Aśvins must be meant to evoke the three celebrated padā́ni of Viṣṇu (cf. I.154.4).

Perhaps it is simply the Aśvins’ penchant for trios (not found in this hymn, however) that is the point of contact. One might note, however, that in the next hymn (VIII.9), also by Vatsa, vs. 2 asks the Aśvins to confer on us the power in the midspace, in heaven, and “through the five peoples of Manu” (i.e., on earth). Since Viṣṇu’s three steps cover the same three cosmic divisions, the Aśvins’ geographical reach may be alluded to here. Even more striking in the next hymn (VIII.9.12d), the Aśvins “stand in the strides of Viṣṇu” (víṣṇor vikrámaṇeṣu tíṣṭhathaḥ).

The purport of the paradoxical pāda b is also not clear; see speculations by Old, Ge, and Re. I think it must have something to do with the anxiety expressed throughout this hymn about exactly where the Aśvins are and our oft-expressed desire for them to leave wherever it is and come to us. So we are never sure whether they are visible or hidden.

The final pāda reflects our also stated desire that the Aśvins forsake other sacrificers to come to us (see esp. vs. 8).
