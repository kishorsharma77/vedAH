The motivation for some of these statements needs some explication. The first hemistich concerns two negative figures; the second one, in pāda b, the man who swells up on surā, the secular and disreputable drink -- in other words a drunk, a lush, or in Ge’s felicitous tr. “die Schnappshelden” -- is implicitly contrasted with a man who handles the much-honored drink soma in a ritual context. But why should a rich man (pāda a) be disfavored? Perhaps because he has what he needs and need not enter into partnership with Indra, whereas we, more needy, are willing to engage in the reciprocal activities involved in honoring Indra. I reluctantly abandoned my tr. of revántam- as ‘fat cat’, primarily because revánt- is not usually used in slangy contexts.

I’m afraid that I don’t understand the second hemistich at all, primarily because I don’t know whether the omitted object of sám ūhasi should be the negative figures of ab or positively or neutrally viewed humans in general. The sentiment of pāda d would support the latter idea: that when Indra enters into battle, he puts everyone together (under his protection), thereby behaving like a father. But the only other instance of sám √ūh (I.131.3), also with Indra as subject, has him shoving the two opposing sides into fighting each other, with a come-what-may attitude. This seems more likely here, in which case pāda d would express the opposing sides’ competing calls to Indra to help them.
