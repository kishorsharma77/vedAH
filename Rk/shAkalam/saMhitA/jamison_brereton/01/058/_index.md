Agni
Nodhas Gautama
9 verses: jagatī 1–5, triṣṭubh 6–9
Although Nodhas Gautama’s poetic intricacy is not as much on display in his Agni  hymns as in his Indra hymns, he excels here in his vivid and dense depiction of  physical fire, especially the forest fire. In the jagatī portion of the hymn, verses con cerning ritual fire (1, 3) alternate with evocations of the unchecked passage of fire  in the woods (2, 4–5), while the final four verses (6–9), in triṣṭubh, are only about  the ritual fire. The ritual verses focus on the choosing and installation of Agni as  Hotar (vss. 1, 3, 6–7), especially in its first enactment by the gods and the human  ancestors (see esp. vss. 3, 6).
The counterpoint between wild uncontrollable fire and ritual fire may subtly  emphasize what a feat of civilizing was accomplished by taming fire for sacrificial  (and domestic) purposes in the legendary past, and how this feat is repeated in the  present day. The last two verses (8–9) beg Agni for shelter and protection for us,  the singers. Again, the image of a guardian fire may acquire special intensity by  contrast with the potentially destructive fire in the wild.
