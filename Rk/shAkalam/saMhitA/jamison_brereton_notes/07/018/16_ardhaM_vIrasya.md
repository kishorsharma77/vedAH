Pāda c is notable for the alliterative and etymological figure manyúm manyumyò mimāya, with the middle term manyu-mī́- containing the noun to its left (manyú-) and the root noun of the verb to its right (√mī). Though mimāya phonologically echoes mímānā(ḥ) at the end of 15c, they of course belong to different roots.

Pāda d contains a rare and curious idiom PATH √bhaj; cf. VII.39.1 bhejā́te … pánthām, possibly IX.102.2 ábhakta … padám, which I take (with Ge) to mean “set out on the road,” similar to, though with a different idiomatic verb, Engl. “hit the road.” The expression is complicated here by the question of how to construe pathó vartaním. Is patháḥ acc. pl. and direct object of bhejé, with vartaním the obj. of pátyamāṇaḥ? Such is the interpr. of Ge and Kü (334, 368) -- Ge with an idiomatic interpr. of bhejé patháḥ, Kü with a more literal one. However, I think it more likely that patháḥ is a gen. sg. dependent on vartaním on the basis of IV.45.3 ā́vartaním mádhunā jinvathas patháḥ “You quicken the course of the path with honey.”
