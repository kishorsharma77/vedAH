I have no idea what the buffaloes (mahiṣā́ḥ) are doing here or why they do what they do in the lap of the waters. Ge (n. 4a) suggests that the buffaloes are the gods or the old singers, but this does not actually explain anything (including why they would be called buffaloes). Ge notes the very similar passage X.45.3 tṛtī́ye tvā rájasi tasthivā́ṃsam, apā́ m upásthe mahiṣā́ avardhan “The buffalos strengthened you, who were standing in the third realm, in the lap of the waters.” That passage occurs in a hymn concerned with Agni’s triple birth, one of which is in the waters, but the identity of the buffaloes remains unclear. In X.8.1 it is Agni himself who as buffalo grows strong in the same place: apā́ m upásthe mahiṣó vavardha “the buffalo has grown strong in the lap of the waters.” The second pāda shows the connection between Agni Vaiśvānara and royal power and the second hemistich the connection between that thematic complex and Vivasvant, as Proferes convincingly argues (Sovereignty, pp. 28-29 and passim).

Note the phonological intertwining of #víśo … / … vivásvato # vaiśvānaró …
