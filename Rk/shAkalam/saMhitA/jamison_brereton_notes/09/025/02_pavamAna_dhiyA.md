hitáḥ here fairly clearly belongs to √hi ‘impel’, given the expressions of movement and goal in the rest of the vs. But the ambiguity between hitá- ‘impelled’ and ‘placed’ is common in this maṇḍala, as we’ve already seen (e.g., IX.1.2).

Both Ge and Re take dhármaṇā to be Soma’s: “nach deiner Bestimmung” and “selon (ta) nature” respectively. However, I take it to refer to the statute or ordinance of the ritual, in particular that which establishes Vāyu as the first recipient of the soma drink: dhármaṇā is used in this exact sense here as well as in IX.63.22 and I.134.5; see disc. ad the latter passage.
