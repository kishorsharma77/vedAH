Agni
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
6 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 15–16
The first fourteen verses in this hymn, in jagatī, end with the refrain “while in com pany with you may we not come to harm.” The first half of the hymn (vss. 1–7) gives  little motivation for this repeated, preventative hope: the subject is primarily the  sacrifice and the mutually beneficial relationship between Agni and the sacrificers.  But in verses 8 and 9 evil rivals of the sacrificer appear, and Agni’s aid against them  is requested. The next two verses (10–11) sketch the dangers posed by Agni himself  as the uncontrolled forest fire, and verse 12 calls for Agni’s help against the most  potent menace of all, the anger of the gods. The remaining verses (13–16) return to  the reassuring realm of properly performed sacrifice, with Agni providing benefits  and protection to the ritualist.
