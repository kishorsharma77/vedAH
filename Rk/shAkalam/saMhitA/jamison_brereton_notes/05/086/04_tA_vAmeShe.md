As noted above, the éṣe + GEN. here helps explain 3cd. It is also integrated into the omphalos-framing (semi)repeated pāda indragnī́havāmahe. Most standard tr., however, render éṣe here not as ‘in quest of, in pursuit of’, but as ‘rush, run, course’ (e.g., Ge “im Rennen der Wagen,” Re “pour la course de chars”, WG “anlässlich eines Wagenrennens”), implicitly accepting Gr’s separation of éṣa- into two stems ‘das Hineilen, Eilen’ and ‘Aufsuchen, Begehren’. éṣe + GEN. is found three times elsewhere in V -- V.41.5, 8 (both rāyá éṣe “in quest of wealth”) and this very pāda in V.66.3 -- and it seems uneconomical to give these similar syntagms in the same maṇḍala two entirely different meanings. Old (ZDMG 62: 477-78 [=KlSch 286-87]) makes similar points, arguments accepted by Bl (RReps ad V.66.3).
