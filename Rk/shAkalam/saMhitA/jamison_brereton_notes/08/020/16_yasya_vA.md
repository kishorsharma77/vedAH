The yásya vā opening this verse, parallel to yó vā in 15c, shows that this clause is still dependent on the main clause in 15ab subhágaḥ sá “very fortunate he …” The main clause in 16c may refer only to the vājín- of ab or to the various subhága- folk of vss. 15-16.

The hapax gatha in b is an anomalous form, with a present 2nd pl. ending (- tha) on a root aorist stem. It is clearly a nonce form generated beside 2nd pl. impv.

gata in 10d. The pādas are otherwise almost identical: 10d havyā́no vītáye gata, 16b ā́havyā́vītáye gatha.
