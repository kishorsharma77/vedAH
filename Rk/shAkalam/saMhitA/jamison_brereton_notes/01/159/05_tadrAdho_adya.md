As Ge notes (n. 5ab), the first hemistich is reminscent of the Gāyatrī mantra (III.62.10), with our pāda a tád (rā́dho adya) savitúr váreṇyam an expanded version of III.62.10a tát savitúr váreṇyam and our b devásya … manāmahe perhaps meant as a partial paraphrase of III.62.10b … devásya dhīmahi, with a misanalysis of dhīmahi as belonging to √dhī ‘think’, rather than being the root aor. med. opt. of √dhā ‘place’ —hence the subj. manāmahe ‘we will think about’. This may provide significant evidence of the status and interpr. of the Gāyatrī mantra at this early period.
