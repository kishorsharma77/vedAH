Though, as indicated in the publ. intro., the 2nd half of this hymn (vss. 4-6) has a very different tone from the first, nonetheless the two halves are bound together.

Note, first, that voc. yaviṣṭha in 4a matches nom. yáviṣṭhaḥ in the same metrical position in 3c. Moreover, the worshiper who was identified as cikitvā́n ‘observant’ in 1d is contrasted with humans who have caused offense to Agni by their ácitti- ‘lack of observance, heedlessness’ in 4b.

Although puruṣatrā́has the locational suffix -trá / -trā́, it seems less a locational ‘among men’ than an abstract ‘manhood, human nature’. Cf. similar expressions with the abstract suffix -tā-: VII.57.4 = X.15.6 yád va ā́gaḥ puruṣátā kárāma.

The use of áditeḥ in pāda c is clarified by the more expansive expression in d.

On the one hand, áditi- is, of course, the name of the goddess and mother of the Ādityas, and the mention of her here ushers in the 2nd half of the hymn, which, as was indicated in the publ. intro., has a distinctly Ādityan tone. On the other, á-diti- means literally ‘unbinding’ (< √dā ‘bind’), and the lexeme ví … √śrath ‘let loose’ in the VP vy énāṃsi śíśrathaḥ ‘let loose our transgressions’ is synonymous with ‘unbind’.
