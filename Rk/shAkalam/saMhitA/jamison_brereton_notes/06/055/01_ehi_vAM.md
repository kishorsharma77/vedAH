The tonic 1st dual nominative prn. vā́m ‘we two’ is a hapax -- the only occurrence of this distinct nominative in all of Sanskrit, replaced post-RV by āvám.

See AiG III.465-66. It opens its clause, but because it follows the vs.-initial impv.

éhi, it appears to be in 2nd position. Is it an accident that this is where the extremely well-attested enclitic dual 2nd ps. vām is ordinarily found?
