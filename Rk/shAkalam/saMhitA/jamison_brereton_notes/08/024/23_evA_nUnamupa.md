A very cute pun, with návam meaning, as often in a hymnal context, ‘anew’, but in conjunction with daśamám ‘tenth’ evoking náva ‘nine’.

caráṇi- is a hapax, but most likely derived from the root √car ‘wander’ (see EWA s.v. CARI , though AiG II.2.207 considers it of unclear meaning). It must have been created to contrast semantically with the very frequent near-rhyme form carṣaṇí- ‘settled/boundaried peoples’, whose gen. pl. carṣaṇīnā́m occurs 35x in the RV, always at the end of the pāda as here (including VIII.23.7 hótāram carṣaṇīnā́m, the adjacent hymn by the same poet). That the short initial syllable of caráṇīnām produces a bad cadence surely draws more attention to the word it was created in opposition to.
