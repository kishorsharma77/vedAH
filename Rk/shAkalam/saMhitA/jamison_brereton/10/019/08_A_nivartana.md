You turner back, turn them here; you turner back, turn them back. The earth has four quarters: from these, turn them back.
The Anukramaṇī gives a choice of authorship for the next seven hymns, X.20– 26: Vimada, the son of Indra or Prajāpati, or Vasukr̥t Vāsukra. The patronymic of  the latter choice would identify the poet as a son or descendant of Vasukra Aindra,  the author of the three desperately difficult hymns that immediately follow (27–29).  The poet of X.25.11 also identifies with or identifies himself as Kakṣīvant, the very  skilled poet of I.116–126.
Whatever the poet’s affiliation, he is fond of unusual meters (see esp. 21, 22, 24,  25) as well as puns on the name Vimada. The hymns are dedicated to Agni (20–21),  Indra (22–1st half of 24), the Aśvins (2nd half of 24), Soma (25), and Pūṣan (26).
