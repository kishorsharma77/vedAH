The standard tr. construe añjíṣu with priyā́utá (“and dear in your ornaments”), but the position of utá is somewhat against this: utá is less out of place if priyā́ḥ is all that it’s conjoining. And añjíṣu goes better semantically with “resplendent” than “dear”; cf., for a connection with √śubh, X.78.7 śubhaṃyávo nā́ñjibhir vy àśvitan, also of the Maruts.
