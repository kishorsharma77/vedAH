This vs. contains almost the same elements as IX.41.4. Our desired rewards are gómat, vīrávat, áśvāvat, vā́javat, which match 41.4 except that híraṇyavat substitutes for vīrávat there. We also want bṛhatī́r íṣaḥ, like the mahī́m íṣam of 41.4. The soma is described as sutáḥ in both, though the vocatives are different: indo versus soma. But the big difference is that 41.4 has the preverb ā́with pavasva, which licenses the accusative complements, while our passage does not. We must simply supply it here, I’m afraid.
