The referent of this marvellous chariot is disputed. Sāy suggested the year, Lüders (Varuṇa, 690) the sun, Ge the praise-song, the sacrifice, or the wish that the gods bring. As Re points out, a choice does not have to be made; the interpretation is “volontairement polyvalente.” However, I assume that the primary reading is the sacrifice and its associated verbal expression, as so often.

The surprising descriptor of this chariot is áviśvaminva- ‘not speeding/moving everyone’. This word has to be evaluated alongside its positive counterpart, viśvaminvá-, used of Pūṣan in 6a. In both that verse and this one Pūṣan (in this vs. along with Soma) is the subj. of √jinv ‘quicken’. This oppositional phraseology favors Old’s suggestion that the chariot lacks something required to “move everyone” until Pūṣan (and Soma) provide the enlivening push. However, Ge’s quite different suggestion, that the chariot only carries gods and qualified priests, gets support from the only other occurrence of áviśvaminva-, in the riddle hymn, I.164.10, where the gods (probably) speak speech that knows everything but does not move everyone (viśvavídaṃ vā́cam áviśvaminvām), a formulation that probably refers to profound speech that only affects initiates or those with already prepared minds. As with the identity of the chariot itself, probably both interpr. can be simultaneously applied. In the publ. tr. vṛ́ṣaṇā appears to be tr. as a voc.; it is not, and the tr. might be clearer as “that do you two bulls quicken.”
