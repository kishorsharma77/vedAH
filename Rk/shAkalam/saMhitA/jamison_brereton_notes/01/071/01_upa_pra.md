The meter of this first verse almost serves as a transition from Parāśara’s Dvipadā Virāj hymns that precede it to his Triṣṭubh ones beginning here (-I.73), as all four pādas (as well as 2a) have openings of 5 (as if in Dvipadā Virāj) and the first two are syntactic units. The hymn then settles down into a pattern of mostly 4- syllable openings.

The underlying fem. subject of this verse is universally taken to be the fingers of the priest producing fire by friction from the kindling sticks. The qualifier sánīḷāḥ can be read with both the simile and the frame: the fingers belong to the same hand as the co-wives do to the same household. So Ge, etc. The sexual innuendo fits the friction context well, in addition to setting the stage for the incest theme to come.

The object phrase śyā́viṃ áruṣīm “the dusky and the ruddy [fem.]” is generally taken to refer to night and dawn (although Old [SBE and Noten] wishes to emend the text to fem. nom. pls. modifying the sisters, a generally bad idea). The identification with night and dawn is certainly supported by III.55.11, adduced by Ge, etc., with the same vocabulary. However, it would essentially duplicate the simile of d (“they delighted in night and dawn, like cows in dawn”), a clumsiness that seems uncharacteristic of Parāśara, and one also wonders why the fingers would care about night and dawn. I think, instead, that this is another of Parāśara’s tricks, using color terms associated with the two time periods to pick out another referent entirely, namely the aráṇi- (fem.) ‘kindling sticks’, which the fingers should care about, since they are manipulating them. The color differentiation is a little odd, but I don't think it's entirely out of the question. In X.184.3 the kindling sticks are called 'golden' (hiraṇyayī), and one can imagine that as the fire begins to catch hold, the upper stick might glow red, while the lower one would be wreathed in dark smoke.
