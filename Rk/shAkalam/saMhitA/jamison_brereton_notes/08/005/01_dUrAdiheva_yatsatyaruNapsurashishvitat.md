áśiśvitat is an isolated verbal form; the stem is otherwise not attested. Gr identifies it as the “Aor. des Caus.,” and formally this is possible (type atitrasat ‘made terrified’ √tras). However, there is no trans./caus *śvetáyati to which it could have been generated, and there is no possible direct object in this passage to justify a trans./caus. reading. It is more likely a nonce intrans. redupl. aor. (type apaptat ‘flew’ √pat) created to substitute for the s-aor. aśvait (or the root aor. *aśvet on which aśvait is built, acdg. to Narten), which would not fit the expected iambic cadence of dimeter verse. The i root vocalism of √śvit would account for the redupl. vowel, which would by chance coincide with the redupl. vowel expected for a causative aorist: short i before the initial cluster.
