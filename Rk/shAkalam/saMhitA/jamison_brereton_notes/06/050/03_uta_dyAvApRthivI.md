There is a surprising lack of agreement about the construction of this vs. Both Ge and Re take ab as a separate clause, which requires them to supply a verb for it (“ihr … besitzet”; “qui avez”). In cd they also both construe maháḥ in the yathā́ cl., but this is impossible, since it precedes the main verb karathaḥ. (I take maháḥ adverbially, as often and in 6d below [by my account].) See Old for a rather fussy disc. of various possibilities in cd. I do not see the problem with my interpr., which has karathaḥ in c govern the accusatives in ab, with a yáthā purpose cl. taking up most of cd (starting with várivaḥ right before the subord. conj.) This cl. lacks an overt verb, but an existential subjunctive ásat ‘there will be’ is easy to supply. (All interpr. must do something like this, unless they emend to accented *kárathaḥ.) Ge (n. 3cd) worries about the tautology of … no, asmé …, which he avoids by construing naḥ with maháḥ … várivaḥ and asmé with the NP of d (“Machet, dass uns grosse Freibahn werde (und) unserem Wohnsitz Befreiung von allem Übel”)(sim.

Re), but I find the pronominal doubling far less troublesome than extracting a piece of the subord. clause and fronting it around the main verb, as the Ge/Re interpr.

requires.
