In d the sequence ṛ́ṣiṃ vā must have been fronted around the rel. yám, since the phrase as a whole ṛ́ṣiṃ vā yáṃ rā́jānaṃ vā does not mean “either the seer or which king” but “which seer or king” -- or even better “which one, whether seer or king.” I take the thematic stem súṣūda- as ultimately deriving from a pf. subjunctive, despite accent. In this particular form, the 2nd pl. indic. pf. *súṣūda, with the rarely occuring 2nd pl. act. pf. ending -a, would have simply been extended by the prim.

ending.
