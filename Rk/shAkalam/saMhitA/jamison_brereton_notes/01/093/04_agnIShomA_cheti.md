As noted in the publ. intro., Bṛsaya, with his very non-Indo-Aryan name, and the destruction of his offspring are found elsewhere only in VI.61.3, a hymn devoted to Sarasvatī. The theft of the provender (avasá-) from the niggard (paṇí-) is also found in that hymn, in vs. 1. The connection between the two hymns to different gods, found in different parts of the Saṃhitā, is not clear to me, but the strong similarity of the passages at least that Bṛṣaya is a paṇí-.
