The hapax kṣúmpa- is universally rendered by modern tr. as ‘mushroom’, though there is no unanimity in earlier interpretations (cf., e.g., Gr: Staude [perennial plant]). There is some etymological support for ‘mushroom’ from modern languages (see EWA s.v.), and ‘mushroom’ works well in the simile, since kicking many varieties of mushroom demolishes them, whereas a perennial plant is generally a sturdier entity. I might go so far as to suggest specifically a puffball, since kicking puffballs releases a satisfying cloud of dust (easily viewed on various YouTube videos), and puffballs do appear to be found in the appropriate geographical area.
