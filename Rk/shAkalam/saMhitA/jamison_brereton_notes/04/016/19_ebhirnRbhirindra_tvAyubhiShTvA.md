The standard tr. supply a verb in ab: Ge “rufe ich,” WG “bitten … wir.” This seems unnecessary: the instr. phrases in ab can be parallel to dyumnaíḥ in the simile in c, all controlled by the participial phrase abhí sántaḥ “(we) dominating” in c.

One of the factors that might support supplying a verb in ab is the otherwise apparently orphaned acc. encl. tvā at the end of pāda a, but even as Ge advances this reason for supplying a verb (n. 19a), he also suggests that tvā could be dependent on immediately preceding tvāyúbhiḥ, an explanation that the close sandhi of the two words (tvāyúbhiṣ ṭvā) might favor.

In b víśve, in the phrase víśva ājaú, must be a loc., although we might expect the pronominal form víśvasmin. It is, however, worth noting that víśvasmin is found only twice in the RV, in the same phrase (víśvasmin bháre) in adjacent hymns in the Xth Maṇḍala (X.49.1, X.50.4). A nominal-type loc. víśve here would also be facilitated by the plural version víśveṣu ... ājíṣu in I.130.8 with simple truncation of the -ṣu.

Although Ge construes dyumnaíḥ not in the simile but as an attribute of the subject (“we”), the almost identical X.115.7 dyā́vo ná dyumnaír abhí sánti mā́nuṣān may (but need not) support keeping it with the simile; Ge separates the two in his tr.

of that passage as well.
