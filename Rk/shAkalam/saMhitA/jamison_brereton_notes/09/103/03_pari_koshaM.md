As noted above, the “seven voices” (vā́ṇīḥ … saptá) remind us of the seven mothers in IX.102.4. As Re points out, Lü (681-82) identifies the saptá vā́ṇīḥ as the heavenly rivers (though not mentioning this passage). If this identification is correct, it is even closer to 102.4, where we identified the seven mothers as rivers. (Gr construes saptá with immediately preceding ṛ́ṣīṇām [“wo weniger gut mit vā́ṇīs verbunden”], which of course evokes the group of the Seven Seers, much more prominent in later texts than in the RV, where they are mentioned only four times, primarily in late hymns: saptá ṛ́ṣayaḥ [IV.42.8, X.130.7], saptaṛṣáyaḥ [X.82.2, 109.4]. However, in that case we might expect overt gen. saptānā́m to modify the gen. pl. ṛ́ṣīṇām). Gr’s objection to taking saptá with vā́ṇīḥ does not seem to have merit, since the phrase saptá vā́ṇīḥ, without the seers, is found elsewhere.)
