The publ. tr. does not render the rel. yáḥ since the rel. cl. is entirely nominal. It is not clear how far it extends - perhaps the first hemistich, perhaps through pāda c, perhaps only the first pāda - since Soma is nominative both in the rel. cl. and in the main cl. The main cl. must constitute at least the last pāda because the finite verb rājati is unaccented.

The phrase padavī́ḥ kavīnā́m is found also in 6a.

What the referent of the “third domain” (tṛtī́yaṃ dhā́ma) is is unclear. Lü (273), not surprisingly, has precisely mapped the spatial geography and considers the third domain to be heaven (1 earth, 2 midspace, 3 heaven), with the fourth, in the next vs., the samudra-, which is higher than heaven. I think it more likely that these are ritual references, quite possibly to locations on the ritual ground that Soma traverses on his journey (see dhā́māni ā́ryā in IX.63.14 and comm. thereon). If “gaining the sun” (svarṣā́ḥ) refers to Soma’s uniting with the milk mixture (assimilated to the sun because of its gleaming whiteness), then the third domain, which comes after, might be the vessels near the ritual fire. If the dhā́man- are not spatial but temporal, this could be a ref. to the third pressing. Ge (n. 18c) takes it as reference to the forms or phases of soma; Re tr. ‘structure’ without further elaboration.

As generally noted by tr. (Ge, Re, also Scar [72]), pāda d involves a play on the names of the Anuṣṭubh and Virāj meters. The publ. tr. fails to register the pun on virā́jam, well captured by Scar “Soma herrscht nach Art eines Grosskönigs.” I would now substitute a fuller (if more awk.) tr.: “Soma, as rhythm [/ the Anuṣṭubh meter], rules as wide-ruling one [/regulates the Virāj (meter) according to rule].” This tr.

assumes that virā́jam represents not only the acc. sg. of the rt. noun cmpd. virā́j-, but also the nom. sg. pres. part. *virā́jan to the them. pres. rā́jati. This seems preferable to trying to construe it as an acc. sg. in the sense ‘wide-ruling’, and the interchange of final nasals would be fairly trivial for a pun. Scar. (72 n. 97) notes that the lexeme ánu √rāj is used in II.43.1 also of regulating meters, there Gāyatrī and Triṣṭubh. The preverb ánu also has to be read with ṣṭúp, as a cmpd decomposed and flanking rājati (ánu rājati ṣṭúp), for the meter name. The technical references to meters here may be the culmination of the kaví- / ṛ́ṣi- theme of 17-18.
