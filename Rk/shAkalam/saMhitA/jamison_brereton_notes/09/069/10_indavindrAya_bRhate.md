Pāda b is oddly phrased: it contains the idiom ā́pavasva, which ordinarily means “attract X-ACC here through your purification” (see comm. ad IX.7.8 and passim), but though it has an acc. (jaṭháram), it would seem quite odd to say “attract Indra’s belly here through your purification.” It seems rather to be a variant of 9b índrasya hā́rdi … ā́viśa “enter the heart of Indra.” And the lexeme ā́pavate does seem to have a variant construction with acc. of goal. Cf. ā́pavasva … pavítram IX.25.6, 50.4 “purify yourself in(to?) the filter.”
