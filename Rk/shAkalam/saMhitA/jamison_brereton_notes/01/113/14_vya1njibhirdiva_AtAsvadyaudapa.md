This verse plays on the lexeme ví √vas that dominated vss. 7-13. The verse begins with the preverb ví, setting up the expectation that a form of √vas will follow.

But instead the pāda ends with adyaut, a near synonym. The next pāda does end with āvaḥ, which matches (vy) ā̀vaḥ of 13b but belongs instead to the root √vṛ ‘(un)cover’.

The verb is here construed with pāda-initial ápa, but the dominant preverb ví is implied by the immediate preceding word (de)vī́(devy ā̀vah). Cf. also remarks on 4b ví … āvaḥ ‘She opened, uncovered’ above.
