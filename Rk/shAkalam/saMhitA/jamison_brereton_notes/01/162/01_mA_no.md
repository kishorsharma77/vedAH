Although the collection of gods serving as witnesses in ab seems somewhat random, the same set recurs in V.41.2, as Ge points out. The reason for their association there is no clearer than here.

Pāda d, pravakṣyā́maḥ (vidathé) vīryā̀ṇi, is a variant on the famous opening of I.32, the great Indra hymn, índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi právocam. The gen. índrasya of I.32.1 is matched by the long gen. phrase in our c: (yád) vājíno devájātasya sápteḥ “of the prize-winning, god-born race-horse.” For another variant on this phrase in Dīrghatamas’s oeuvre, see I.154.1. It is striking here that vīryā̀ṇi ‘heroic/manly’ deeds are attributed to a horse; the establishment of “personhood” for the horse, discussed in the publ. intro., begins here in the very first verse.
