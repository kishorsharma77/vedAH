In the second hemistich the clause beginning ádha yád raises some syntactic/interpretational issues. The standard interpr. (also incl. Klein DGRV II.127) assume that yád stands here for yébhiḥ, rendering the clause, in Klein’s tr., “and (with) what(ever) they bear among us for you with their (poetic) thoughts, (just) as the Adhvaryu's (do).” Besides arbitrarily modifying the relative marker, this interpr.

also requires supplying a 3rd pl. subj. for bháranti different from adhvaryávaḥ. I prefer to keep yád as a subordinating conjunction and read ná as having domain over the whole clause, not just adhvaryávaḥ. Although I am unhappy with this stretching of the function of ná, the other alternations seem to me more radical. For a similar use of ná (in my interpr.), see I.131.2fg and comment thereon. What Adhvaryus bear to a god is soma (II.14.1 ádhvaryavo bháraténdrāya sómam; cf. I.135.3).

I do however now note that bháranti with unidentified subject is found in I.151.7, where they bring songs (gíraḥ) along with thought (mánmanā) to the gods.

Given the verbal connections among these three hymns (I.151-53), I may need to rethink the interpr. here along the lines of the standard tr: “They bring you (songs) along with insights (dhītíbhiḥ), as Adhvaryus (do soma).”
