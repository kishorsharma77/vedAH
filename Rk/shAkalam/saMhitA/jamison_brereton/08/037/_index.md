Indra  
Śyāvāśva Ātreya  
7 verses: mahāpaṅkti, except atijagatī 1  
For the relationship between this hymn and its twin, VIII.36, see the introduction  to the previous hymn. As discussed there, the final verse (7) of this hymn with its  reference to kṣatrā́ṇi “lordly powers” (as opposed to the “priestly formulations” of  VIII.36.7) puts the hymn in the domain of the kṣatriya varṇa. Unlike the previous  hymn, where the brahmanical aspect is muted at best, this hymn does present a  kingly and martial profile in the variant material in the first pādas of verses 2–6.
