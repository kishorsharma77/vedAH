dráviṇo dádhānā in b is essentially the same VP as dráviṇam … dhattam in 1c. I do not know why the s-stem drávinas- was substituted for the thematic dráviṇa-, esp. as the acc. of the latter, dráviṇam, would fit the meter just as well. The first VP, dráviṇaṃ dhattam, reappears in 6c.

There are other echoes of previous vss.: 3cd sáṃ vām … sám repeats 1a, and matīnā́m in c both repeats the same word in the same metrical position in 2a and anticipates it in 4c.

The 2nd half of this vs. is structured like that of vs. 2, esp. pāda d, where both 2d and 3d have the form PREV stómāsaḥ PRES.PASS.PART. INSTR.(‘song’)-aiḥ. The instr.

could, as in the previous vs., express accompaniment.

As in 2, I see a pun here: because of the etym. figure añjantv aktúbhiḥ “let them anoint with ointments,” the principal sense of aktú- must be ‘ointment’, here metaphorical for the “ointments of thoughts.” But instr. aktúbhiḥ often means ‘through the nights’, as in the phrase dyúbhir aktúbhiḥ “through the days and the nights” (e.g., I.112.25), and I see this temporal sense here as well.
