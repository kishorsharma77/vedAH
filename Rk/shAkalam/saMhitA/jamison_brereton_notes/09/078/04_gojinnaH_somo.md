On this vs. see publ. intro.

The first pāda is problematic. The standard interpr. is that Soma’s navel is tied either to the navel in heaven (Ge, Old, Ober [II.13], Kü [242]) or Soma’s navel in heaven is tied to our navel (Re). E.g., Ge: “Du, dessen höchster (Nabel) an den abel im Himmel geknüpft ist.” Before even considering what this would really mean, there is a simple grammatical problem: this interpr. (and those of the others) requires masc. paramáḥ and yáḥ both to refer to fem. nā́bhi-. Disc. of this gender clash is remarkably cavalier. Old suggests that nā́bhi- may be masc. here; Ge (n. 4ab) registers this suggestion but also suggests that the synonym bándhu- could be supplied in substitution (not a bad idea, though bándhu- is rare in the RV and doesn’t seem to show up in the vicinity of nā́bhi-). The push to have two forms of nā́bhi- in this pāda is clearly based on very similar IX.10.8 nā́bhā nā́bhim na ā́dade “He has bound his navel to our navel” and the idiom sám / ā́√dā ‘tie’ with two forms of ‘navel’, on which see comm. ad I.139.1. There is another slight problem, that the rel.

prn. yá(ḥ) is rather too deep in its clause, if the whole pāda forms the rel. cl., as in most interpr.

I don’t have a good solution to this pāda. I would first point out that init. diví te matches up with init. pṛthivyā́s te in b, and at least the disturbance in word order in the pāda may result from the desire to locate heaven and earth in parallel positions.

Otherwise, instead of assuming a masc. nā́bhi- I supply ‘form’ with the masc.

paramó yáḥ in the publ. tr., but there is no particular support for this, and if I was thinking of rūpá- at the time, this doesn’t work because rūpá- is neut. There are no masc. nouns that are regularly qualified by paramá-, while nā́bhi- is qualfied as paramā́(with a fem. form) in X.61.18. The upshot is - I’m fairly sure my rendering is wrong, or at least not right, and I’d be inclined to go with the standard, despite the distressing gender clash: “It was in heaven, to its navel, that your highest (navel) was bound.” As to what this means, presumably it is another instantiation of the “heavenly soma” trope: no matter that the physical plant is earthbound (as in pāda b), it has a heavenly analogue. One thing that is clear is that ādadé belongs to √dā ‘bind’; see comm. ad I.139.1 and Kü 242.

Fortunately the rest of the vs. is relatively straightforward. The “fingers” that grow on the earth are the parts of the plant: if soma is ephedra intermedia (wfhich grows in the Himalayas), it has slender upright shoots that could be conceived of as fingers.
