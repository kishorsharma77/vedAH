Note the chaining between tṛcas, with the refrain of vss. 4-6 vavákṣitha, returning as the first word of the following verse, vavakṣúḥ, with person and number adjustment. Interestingly, it's this verse where the Anhang refrain doesn't precisely match the two following verses: ávardhayat versus prá vāvṛdhe, with the same root but different stem, and transitive versus intransitive. This is the only such deviation in this hymn.
