On mahó rāyé see comm. ad IV.31.11. Again the publ. tr. carelessly follows Ge’s tr., which takes the two forms together, as if they were an adjective-noun syntagm despite the difference in case. I would now take maháḥ adverbially with Old.

See further ad VI.1.2.

The seven lofty and joy-bringing feminine beings (bṛhatī́ḥ saptá … mayobhúvaḥ) in cd, the target of our invocation, are not further specified. I have supplied ‘cows’ on the basis of ab and IX.86.25, which contains saptá dhenávaḥ, but this is by no means certain. See other suggestions in Ge’s n. 1. The problem is that there is no reason for the cows to number exactly seven; either ‘seven’ is, as Oberlies (Rel. RV II.74) suggests, simply an indication of totality, or some more standard group of seven, like the rivers, is being referred to (either via the image of cows or directly).
