Savitar The word vratá- ‘commandment’ is prominent in this hymn (vss. 2, 3, 6, 7, 9).

The point is repeatedly made that all creatures, incl. the gods, follow the vratá-s of Savitar. Another persistent verbal theme is the contrast between sám and ví (4a, 4c, 6a), which can be discerned even when only ví is present (1c, 3a, 5b, 6c, 7b, 8d). The hymn also has a pronounced tendency towards augmented 3rd sg. root aorists (+/- preverb) at the ends of pādas, esp. at the ends of hemistichs: 1b asthāt, 3d ā́gāt, 4d ā́gāt, 5c ā́dhāt, 6b abhūt, 6c ā́gāt, 8c (ā́…) gāt, 8d ā́kaḥ, 11b ā́gāt (cf. also opt.

avyāḥ 10b).
