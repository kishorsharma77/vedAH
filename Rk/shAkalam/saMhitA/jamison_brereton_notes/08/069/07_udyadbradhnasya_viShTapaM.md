Another elliptical 1st dual construction; for disc. see VIII.62.11.

Ge and Hoffmann, inter alia, take bradhnásya viṣṭápam to refer to the height or top of the sun. The phrase occurs also in IX.113.10. bradhná- in VIII.4.13-14 seems to refer to soma. Since viṣṭáp- several times occurs with samudrásya (VIII.34.13, 97.5=IX.12.6, IX.107.14), something liquid makes sense, rather than wandering around on top of the sun. Furthermore, at least in IX.12.6 (and probably IX.107.14) the “sea” in this expression is clearly soma. I also think that it works better as acc. of extent, rather than as goal, since the goal is the grhám ̥ .

For the ceremonial aspects of the second hemistich see publ. intro. Note that sákhi- is an integral part of the “seventh step” mantra at the wedding ceremony: sakhā saptapadī bhava “Become a comrade of the seventh step” (ŚGS I.14.6, etc.; see Jamison 1996: 121). Contra Hoffmann (1967: 255) I separate tríḥ from saptá, and consider the former to refer to drinking soma at the three pressings (so also Ge). I also take the cardinal saptá as if it were the ordinal saptátha-. For the corresponding verse, see 16 below.
