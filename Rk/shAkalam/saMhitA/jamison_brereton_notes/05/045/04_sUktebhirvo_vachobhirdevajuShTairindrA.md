The vaḥ in Wackernagel’s position can be construed in a number of different ways. I take it as the poet’s address to his colleagues to praise and importune the two gods. Since the next two vss. (5-6) consist of 1st pl. exhortations to proceed with the sacrifice and achieve effective ritual poetry, my interpr. fits the larger context well.

Ge also seems to assume the referents are human, but are rather the potential beneficiaries of the poet’s own plea to the gods (sim. WG). By contrast Schmidt (and less clearly Lü) take it as direct address to the gods; Schmidt “… wollen wir jetzt euch, Indra und Agni, zur Hilfe rufen.” Given the number discrepancy between pl.

vaḥ and the dual dvandva índrā … agnī́, this seems unlikely. Note also that the noninitial accent on agnī́precludes a voc. interpr. of the dvandva, though that alone would not prevent vaḥ from referring to them.

I do not understand the intrusion of the Maruts here. They are not gods of the dawn sacrifice, nor are they associated with the Vala myth or with the Aṅgirases.

Perhaps their prominence elsewhere in the Vth Maṇḍala (esp. V.52-61) is responsible for their brief appearance here, prompted by the mention of Indra. They are presumably not only the objects of yájanti but also of āvívasantaḥ: “winning” them would involve persuading them to come to our sacrifice.
