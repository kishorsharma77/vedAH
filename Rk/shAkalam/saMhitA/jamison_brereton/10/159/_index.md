Against Cowives  
Śacī Paulomī  
6 verses: anuṣṭubh  
Like X.145 this hymn is in the voice of a woman, speaking in the 1st person, against  her cowives. But, whereas in X.145 she was in the act of performing the spell with  which she hoped to vanquish her cowife, in this hymn her triumph is complete. She  recites a victory paean, in the appropriate high rhetorical style—albeit with some  dips into the vernacular, such as the diminutivized derivative of the personal pro  
noun in verse 1, māmaká “li’l ole me.” It is worth noting that in verse 3 she extends  her triumph to her sons and her daughter; as the early parts of the Rāmāyaṇa teach  us, one of the most important reasons that cowives plot against each other is to  secure preferment for their children.
