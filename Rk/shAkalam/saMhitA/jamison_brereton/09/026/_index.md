Soma Pavamāna  
Idhmavāha Dārḍhacyuta  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
Attributed to a descendant of the poet of the previous hymn, based on his patronymic,  this hymn contains nothing novel in terms of content, but it is tightly structured. All verses but the last begin with “that one, him” (tám) referring to the Soma, while the  last begins with a 2nd-person variant on this, “you” (táṃ tvā), literally “that you.”  The last four verses (3–6) all contain a 3rd plural “they impell(ed)” (ahyan, hinvanti built to the same root √hi), and the compounds of 3c and 5c “...to/of many” (bhū́ri)  phonologically echo the word for “arms” (bhuríjor) in the middle verse (4a).
