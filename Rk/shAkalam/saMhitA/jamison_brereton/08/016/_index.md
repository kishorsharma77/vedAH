Indra  
Irimbiṭhi Kāṇva  
12 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
This is, in some ways, a meta–praise hymn, that is, a hymn about praising Indra.  Although the hymn is certainly full of actual praise of the deity, it also repeatedly  refers to invoking, praising, singing to, and giving recognition to Indra and his pow ers and deeds—in other words, to the delivery of the praise itself. Perhaps related  to this feature is the noteworthy fact that Indra is in the 3rd person throughout the  hymn, until the direct address and requests of the final verse (12). The constant  3rd-person reference is emphasized by regular fronting and incantatory repetition  of 3rd-person pronouns referring to Indra (see, e.g., vss. 5–6, 8–9) and of his name  (see, e.g., vss. 7, 9, 11).  
As for the content of the praise, it focuses on Indra’s power in warfare, where  separate peoples vie for his aid. Yet, despite the battle theme, the descriptions are  surprisingly devoid of violence, and it is Indra as maker of space (from constric tion, vs. 6) and light (from darkness, vs. 10) and as the verbal advocate for his clients  (vs. 5) who stands out.
