“Fair-weather friend” translates the voc. kadhapriye and is an attempt at an idiomatic English rendering of ‘when-friend’, i.e., ‘uncertain, fickle, or capricious friend’ - following Bloomfield’s (RR, ad I.38.1) attractive explanation of closely related kadhaprī́- as built to the Aśvins’ epithet adhapriyā ‘then-friends’. The epithet is appropriate to the usually reliable Dawn in this verse because the poet questions her as to where she will bestow her presence and favors.
