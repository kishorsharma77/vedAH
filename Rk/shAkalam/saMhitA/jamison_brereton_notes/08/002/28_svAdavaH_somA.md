nā́yám is a famous crux. See esp. Thieme (1949) and more recently Jamison 2013 (Fs. Hock), both with discussion of previous literature. After my recent reconsideration of the evidence I would now eliminate “to the landing site,” since I now think the underlying expression is *nā́ayám “(just) this man here,” which lost its transparency and came to mean “on one’s own” and could be used for any person, not just the 3rd.
