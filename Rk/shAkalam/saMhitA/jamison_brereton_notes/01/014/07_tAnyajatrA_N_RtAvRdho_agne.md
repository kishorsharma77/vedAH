The ab pādas literally mean “make (the gods) possess wives,” but we know from the ritual that this refers to the coming of the gods along with their wives. Cf. III.6.9 pátnīvataḥ … devā́n … ā́vaha. Ge translates our phrase literally: “Die Opferwürdigen … mache beweibt,” but then paraphrases it in his note: “D. h. bring ihre Frauen mit.” The problem would be solved by supplying the preverb ā́, because ā́√kṛ generally means ‘bring/attract here’. Although I am generally loathe to supply material without a clear warrant, it is the case that the immediately preceding pāda, 6c, begins with ā́, which might have been taken to have domain over what follows.
