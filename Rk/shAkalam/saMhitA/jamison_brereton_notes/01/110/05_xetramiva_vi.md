úpastutā in the Saṃhitā text is universally taken, flg. the Pp., as the nom. pl.

of the past part., úpastutāḥ. I take it rather as the loc. sg. of úpastuti- ‘praiseinvocation’. It doesn’t make sense to me that, after having been praised, they would be “crying in want” and seeking (further?) fame, whereas if they lack praise at the praise invocation, their seeking fame is understandable. Loc. sg. -ā to -i-stems is found only interior in the pāda as here, but almost always before consonants.

However, AiG III.152 counts 9 occurrences before -u-/-ū-, as here.

Ge and Re take upamám as the obj. of nā́dhamānāḥ, but that stem is never transitive (as Re admits), and it appears in the preceding hymn (I.109.3) in clear intransitive usage. I take the adj. with śrávaḥ in d. It would also be possible to take it as an adverb: “in utmost need.” WG construe it with the cup in b; this seems the least likely possibility, since the miraculous deed of the Ṛbhus is depicted only in the first hemistich, quite separately their quest for fame in the second.
