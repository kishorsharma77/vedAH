As usual, aryáḥ has a number of possible interpr. Ge takes it as nom. pl.

identical to the sūráyaḥ in d. Old suggests either acc. pl. or abl. sg. without choosing one. Thieme (Fremdling, 73-74) opts for the abl. sg., which he construes (as does Old) with the splv. nṛ́tamāsaḥ: “… als unsere, im Vergleich zum Fremdling sehr heldenhaften Schutzherren …” But of course an ablative with a superlative would be highly unusual (though Old offers a single parallel and a ref. to Delbrück’s Vgl.

Syn.). I also take it as an abl., but suggest construing it with puráḥ. I now see that this is also problematic, since it is not clear that puráḥ ever takes the abl. Gr gives two exx.: but in IV.7.9 the supposed abl. is a gen. and construed elsewhere; in III.53.23 the form in question (áśvān) could be either an abl. sg. or an acc. pl. in sandhi.

Nonetheless I hold to this interpr. Although puráḥ + ABL is not a robust construction, the related purā́is regularly found with the abl. Here I would suggest that we have a sort of pun. The lexeme puráḥ + √dhā ‘set in front, install’ is of course very common, and that phrase is found here, dadhiré puró naḥ. Although, as I just said, to express “ahead of / in front of the stranger” we might expect aryáḥ [abl.] … purā́, there was interference with the VP dadhiré puró naḥ “they have set us in front,” and puráḥ prevailed.
