Aśvins
Suhastya Ghauṣeya
3 verses: jagatī
As we already noted in the introduction to this group of hymns, this brief appendix  is a conventional journey hymn. Nothing in this hymn, save the treatment of the  chariot in verse 1, makes its relationship to the two preceding Ghoṣā hymns evident.  The poet is identified as a son of Ghoṣā by the metronymic Ghauṣeya; his first  name, Suhastya “Good-handed,” is extracted from verse 3.
## 1
This your common three-wheeled chariot—much invoked and worthy of  praise, going again and again to the soma-pressings,
earth-encircling and worthy of the rites—do we invoke with well-twisted  (hymns) at the break of dawn.
## 2
O Nāsatyas, you mount the early-yoked, early-driving, honey-bringing  chariot,
by which you go to the sacrificing clans, o men, and to the sacrifice even  of a weak man, with its Hotar, Aśvins.
## 3
Whether you are going to an Adhvaryu of good hands with honey in his  palms, or to an Agnidh of steadfast skill, a domestic leader,
or to the soma-pressings of an inspired poet, from there drive here to  honey-drinking, o Aśvins.
Kr̥ṣṇa Āṅgirasa is said to be the poet of the next three hymns (42–44), all dedicated  to Indra and showing clear verbal connections.
