Sarasvatı (1–2, 4–6), Sarasvant (3) ̄  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
The multitalented goddess of wisdom and patroness of arts and music familiar from  classical Hindu sources is not the Sarasvatī of the R̥gveda: in this text she is first and foremost a river, and not the mythical river Sarasvatī of later times, but a real,  physical river that flows “from the mountains to the sea” (see vs. 2). Her distin guishing characteristics are all associated with this physical nature: the power and  beauty of her ever-flowing current, and the nourishment and riches it brings with  it. She is often mentioned along with her sister rivers, as first among equals, and  in this hymn (vs. 3) and the next (VII.96.4–6) also with her shadowy male coun terpart Sarasvant.
