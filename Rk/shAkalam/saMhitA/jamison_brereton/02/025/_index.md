Brahmaṇaspati  
Gr̥tsamada  
5 verses: jagatī  
The focus of this hymn is identified in the refrain found in all five verses: the  mortal who is in the favor of Brahmaṇaspati, the lord of the sacred formula tion. The first three-quarters of each verse then specifies the ways in which this  mortal thrives, especially in winning battles and besting his enemies. The first  hemistich of the first verse makes it clear that the fortunate man in question  has won the favor of Brahmaṇaspati by ritual activity, and especially by mak ing his own sacred formulations (bráhman), though the ritual context is not  mentioned again.
