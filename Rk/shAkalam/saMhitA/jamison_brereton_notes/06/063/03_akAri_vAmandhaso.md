There is no expressed subj. to ákāri and the abl./gen. ándhasaḥ has nothing to depend on. Ge takes it as a partitive gen. (n. 3a) but simply tr. as an indef. subject (“Trank ist euch bereitet”), while Re takes it as belonging to an elliptical construction and suggests supplying either sutám or pā́ntam. I prefer to assume that the subject of ákāri has been gapped, and ándhasaḥ is an abl. of source.

In this context I take várīman ‘in/on the expanse’ as referring to the ritual ground on which the barhis has been strewn, rather than simply Ge’s “in voller Breite.” See váriman in 11.

vavande is of course ambig. as to person, but given the 1st ps. in 2a and no intermediate 3rd ps. officiant, it is most likely 1st (so also Ge).

In real-world terms the phrase “the stones have anointed you” is, of course, distinctly peculiar. But in the foreshortened universe of RVic discourse, this simply abbreviates the sequence “the stones pressed out the soma liquid, which was prepared for you to drink, and your drinking of it was as if it were anointing you (and perhaps did, by running down your chins).”
