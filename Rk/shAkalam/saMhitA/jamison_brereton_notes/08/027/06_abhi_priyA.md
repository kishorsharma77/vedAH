The syntax of ab is oddly muddled for what seems on the surface a banal sentiment. The problem is the position of the relative and its relationship both to the priyā́earlier in the verse and accented verb prayāthána later. The key, I think, is neut.

pl. áśvyā ‘equine’. Contra Ge I don’t think that it should be construed with havyā́, with “equine oblations” as a reference to the Aśvamedha -- an interpr. that Re rightly calls “adventurous.” The stem áśvya-, esp. in the neut. pl., is generally used of gifts (rā́dhas-, maghá-) consisting of horses that gods (or patrons) give to mortals (e.g., VII.16.10 yé rā́dhāṃsi dádaty áśvyā maghā́), whereas havyā́are of course oblations given by mortals to gods. I think we therefore must reckon with two different constructions in this hemistich, which accounts for the fractured word order.

On the one hand I see a nominal clause (or rather a nominal clause whose subject is itself a relative clause): “which equine gifts are yours (i.e., come from you), (they) are dear (to us).” On the other, the same predicate priyā́has as subject a full rel.

clause whose verb is prayāthána: “which oblations you drive to, (they) are dear to you.” The vaḥ is used both as a genitive (in the first construction) and as a dative (in the second). Unfortunately it is wrongly placed in the relative clause for this second interpr., but I can only imagine that the poet allowed this small breach to avoid doubling the vaḥ, or rather that the dative could be integrated into the rel. cl.: “which oblations for you you drive to, they are dear.” Note that two different entities are dear to two different groups of beings. I have not yet solved the problem of abhí, however. Re’s interpr. requires prá √yā to be transitive and also intermingles the main and relative clauses in an illegitimate way and should be rejected: “Di(riger) vers (nos) oblations les chères troupes de chevaux que vous mettez en marche.” Ge takes turā́náraḥ as a qualifier of the immediately following Ādityas.

Although both turá- and nṛ́- can sometimes apply to the Ādityas, they are more frequently used of the Maruts, who are somewhat dominant in this part of the hymn (1c, 3d, 5c, 6a, 8a).
