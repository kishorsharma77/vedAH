Although the other occurrence of the med. part. tepāná- (VIII.60.19) is transitive, a passive interpr. works better here.

The gen. ghṛtásya is best construed with dhītíbhiḥ “with visions/thoughts of ghee.” Both Ge and Old suggest that this refers to what we would now call “virtual ghee,” not the real physical substance -- anticipating the purely mental sacrifice of the last tṛca (19-21). But this tṛca (vss. 16-18) seems otherwise to depict a more standard ritual, and I think it more likely that “with visions of ghee” is a shorthand way of referring both to the physical stimulus of Agni’s flame, namely melted butter, and the mental one, the hymns accompanying the libation.
