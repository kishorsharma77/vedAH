Although the standard tr. take antarvā́vat as referring to territory “in between” (e.g., Ge “das dazwischen liegende (Land)”), I follow Schmidt’s (B+I, 102; see also Old ad loc., AiG II.2.893) suggestion that it is a pleonastically marked variant of antárvant- ‘pregnant’, an interpretation that works nicely with the following verse.

Although my translation implies that antarvā́vat modifies kṣáyam, this cannot be true because kṣáya- is masc. My rendering is an abbreviated form of “made his dwelling place into (something) pregnant” (cf. Schmidt “seinen Wohnsitz hat er zu etwas gemacht, das … schwanger ist”).

Where I differ from Schmidt (and some others) is in the interpr. of pastyā̀bhiḥ in pāda c. Opinion is split over whether this stem (and pastyà-) means ‘stream’ or ‘dwelling place’, and Schmidt goes with the former. Although that meaning works well in this passage -- Schmidt takes pāda d as meaning “pregnant (with streams),” that is, well-watered -- on balance the ‘dwelling place’ interpretation fits more contexts better. (Curiously in the same work [B+I, p. 64] Schmidt renders pastyā̀nām in VII.97.5 as “der Häuser.”) For disc. see EWA s.v. pastyà- (favoring ‘dwelling place’ for pastyà- and, less strongly, for pastyā̀-) and Brereton (Ādityas, 94-96 n. 45).

For additional if indirect evidence for ‘dwelling place’ see comm. ad IX.97.18.
