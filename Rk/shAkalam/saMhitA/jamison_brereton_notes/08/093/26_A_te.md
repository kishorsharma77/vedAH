I do not understand Ge’s assertion (n. to 26a), that this verse only makes sense if Agni is the speaker, a view shared by Old. I certainly agree that Agni is the subject: I take 26ab as dependent on 25c, where Agni is the 2nd ps. addressee, and take the participle dádhat of b with the objects found in both a and b, with slightly different senses (‘diffuse’ in a, ‘distribute’ in b, both with preverb ví).

The VP “diffuse your skill” refers to Agni’s sending his light upward and outward; the “skill” in question is preumably his ritual skill, his ability to conduct the oblations to heaven.

The 2nd pl. impv. in c must be addressed to the whole set of ritual participants.

Ge. insists (n. to 26c) that stotṛ́bhyaḥ must be read with pāda b, parallel to dāśúṣe “die Kleinode verteile für den Opfernden, für die Sänger,” but the rigid parallelism of the c pādas in this tṛca suggests rather that it belongs with its pāda. Presumably the full set of participants are chanting on behalf of the subset of “praisers.”
