It is striking that all of ab is made up of vocatives, with each one accented: because of the place of the accent, three of the four words have to be vocatives; only índrajyeṣṭhā(h) could be nom. pl., since índra- has inherent initial accent. The first word of c, víśve, may also be and probably is a voc., making a pair with voc. dévāsaḥ, which opens the preceding pāda. On the voc. of víśva- see comm. ad X.15.6.

It would be satisfying to have three GOD-X bahuvrīhis parallel in semantic and morphological structure, but although Ge (followed by WG) interprets the rāti- in pū́ṣa-rātayaḥ as an agent noun (“mit Pūṣan als Gönner”), rātí- both as simplex and in its fairly numerous compounds is always an abstract ‘giving’ or concretized version thereof (‘gift’), as its morphology as a deverbal feminine abstract would require. I therefore take the third cmpd as a tatpuruṣa pūṣa-rātí- the gift(s)/giving of Pūṣan’. It owes its initial accent to the fact that it is a voc. (as does the bahuvrīhi márudgaṇāḥ [expect *marúdgaṇa-].) The ‘gift’ or ‘giving’ of Pūṣan is described as auspicious (bhadrā́) in VI.58.1.
