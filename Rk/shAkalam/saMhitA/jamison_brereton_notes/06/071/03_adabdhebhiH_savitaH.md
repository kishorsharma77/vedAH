I do not understand why the Vṛtra-smashing is couched in the pres. tense, hatháḥ. The injunc. 2nd du. hatám would fit the same metrical slot, and its corresponding impf. ahatam was in fact used in 1d. The rest of the vs. is preterital, with augmented imperfects amanyata (b), airayatam (c) and pf. paprathuḥ (d). One might argue that the accented injunc. could easily be mistaken for the masc. acc. sg.

ppl. as a modifier of áhim … vṛtrám, but hatám as 2nd du. impv. is fairly common elsewhere (though, it seems, not with an acc. sg. obj. that could facilitate the misidentification). Another possibility is that this is an attempt to convey relative tense in the absence of a functional pluperfect: if Heaven’s giving consent (2nd half of b; ánu … amanyata) logically precedes the smashing itself — not a foregone conclusion: Heaven may have cheered them on while they performed the smashing — then the present hatháḥ would express the action that followed the one conveyed by the impf. amanyata. But I consider this unlikely.

Well-attested samudrá- is otherwise masc.; with Lü (192 and n. 1) I take neut.

pl. samudrā́ṇi in d as an adj. and supply árṇāṃsi from c.
