The image of men stretching their yokes across may refer in part, as Ge suggests, to the beginning of the “Tagewerk des Landmanns.” But as most interpr.

mention, it surely also (or, in my opinion, primarily) is a reference to the beginning of the morning sacrifice: the root √tan ‘stretch’ is regularly used of the sacrifice (probably because of the “stretching out” of the sacrificial ground by carrying the offering fire to the east). That the men are characterized as “seeking the gods” (devayántaḥ) supports a sacrificial interpr.
