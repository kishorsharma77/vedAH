Again Ge takes the presumed loc. asūré as a PN, explicitly rejecting Gr’s ‘sunless time’ in his n. 4b. But I do not see a good reason for this rejection, and given that the Aśvins are the “early-coming” gods and receive offerings before dawn, ‘sunless time’ makes sense ritually. As Old and Ge both point out, asūré is involved in word play with sūráyaḥ, which of course may account for the appearance of this hapax here, as so often.
