With tákṣat we can supply vánā on the basis of I.127.4, as noticed by the standard comm. ṛṇá- is otherwise neut., meaning ‘debt’ (Gr’s supposed fem. ṛṇā́in X.127.7 is actually a neut. pl.) I am inclined to assume that this masc. nom. sg. is a nonce application. But see the cmpd. ṛṇa-cyút- ‘shaking the debtor’ in VI.61.1, in which I also interpr. ṛṇa- as masc. and animate.

The last word of the vs., rāṭ, seems to reprise the similarly pāda-final rā́ṭ in 1a and vanerā́ṭ in 3a, but because it is unaccented, it must be a verb form belonging to √rāj ‘go straight’.
