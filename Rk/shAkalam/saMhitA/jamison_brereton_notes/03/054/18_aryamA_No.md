Ge (/WG) takes pl. yajñíyāsaḥ as predicated of aryamā́… áditiḥ with pāda a simply a nominal clause; this is strictly impossible, since the predicate adj. should be dual. Ge explains the plural on the grounds that the poet is thinking of the other Ādityas. This is possible, but I prefer to take yajñíyāsaḥ as a third term referring to an unspecified set of other gods (quite possibly the rest of the Ādityas), and all three terms as the subj. of pl. yuyóta in c. (So also Re.) The naḥ in pāda a then simply anticipates the same form in c, and b is parenthetical.
