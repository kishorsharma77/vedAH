Indra (1–6), Indra and Br̥haspati (7)  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
This is really an Indra hymn; the final verse dedicated to Indra and Br̥haspati (vs.  7) is simply repeated from the previous hymn (VII.97.10). The theme of the rest of  the hymn is Indra’s close affinity with and unslakable desire for soma. Not only is  it the regular ritual offering that he seeks daily (vss. 1–2), but it belonged to him  from birth (vs. 3) and became his special substance after his first victories (vs. 5).  The deeds and power of Indra are also celebrated. Intriguingly, his mother first  proclaims his greatness (vs. 3): the mention of Indra’s mother, especially in connec  
tion with soma, always tantalizingly alludes to apparently fraught family dynamics  associated with Indra’s birth (see III.48 and IV.18). Verse 5, near the end of the  hymn, repeats the proclamation of his deeds, using the formula sometimes found  and expected at the beginning of a hymn (see, e.g., I.32.1, I.154.1), though not rare  later in the unfolding of the poem.  
The poet, of course, wishes to profit from the battle-might soma inspires in  Indra (vs. 4) and receive some of the spoils of his victories (vs. 6).
