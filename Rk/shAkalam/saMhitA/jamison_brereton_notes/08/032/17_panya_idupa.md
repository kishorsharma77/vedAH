The loc. pánye as beneficiary/target of the verbs √gā ‘sing’ and √śaṃs ‘recite’ is peculiar: these verbs generally take the dative or, esp. with certain preverbs, the accusative. But loc. pánya in sandhi matches the nominative pánya in sandhi (that is, underlying pányaḥ) that begins the next verse (18a), and this match accounts for the unusual case usage. A small, but telling, example of how rhetorical motivations can override strictly grammatical issues.
