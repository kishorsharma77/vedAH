vicāriṇi is generally taken as ‘far-wandering’ vel sim. (e.g., Ge ‘du Wandelbare’), but cf. X.173.2, where the mountain to which the newly installed king is compared is ávicācaliḥ ‘unwavering’; remember also that earth is said to ‘bob up and down’ (nánnamīti) during the thunderstorm in the preceding hymn (V.83.5).

This is the riddle vs.: the puzzle involves positing a number of qualities of the earth that don’t appear to be characteristic of her -- quite unlike the first vs. -- and implicitly asking under what circumstances these unlikely attributes would be true of the earth. who is not explicitly named. In this vs. she is addressed as a ‘wobbler’ (vicāriṇi), she is associated with nights (aktúbhiḥ), she is said to “fling moisure forward” (perúm ásyasi), and she is silvery (arjuni). Neither the unsteady actions nor the silver color and association with night are earth-like.

As Thieme already suggested (Gedichte, 58), the nights can represent the darkness of monsoon clouds and her wobbling results from the thunderstorm. She is also ‘silvery’ with rain, which she ‘flings’ in the forms of streams and rivulets down her slopes, the slopes mentioned in verse 1.
