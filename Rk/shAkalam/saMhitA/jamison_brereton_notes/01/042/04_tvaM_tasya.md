tápuṣi- is attested only twice elsewhere, both times modifying hetí-, hence the supplied ‘weapon’ here.

I.42.7-9: vidaḥ is formally an injunctive and therefore functionally multivalent.

Hoffmann (1967: 263) is not certain that it has modal value, though most tr. (Ge, Re, WG) take it as an impv. (e.g., Ge “schaff hierfür Rat!”). The other question is whether the krátu- that Pūṣan is to find is his own or meant for us (e.g., Re “procure (nous)…”). I have chosen to take the injunctive not as an impv. but a future-oriented indicative and to interpret the krátu- as Pūṣan’s, not ours - the point being that Pūṣan will find the resolve at our sacrifice to fulfill the requests we make of him in the imperatives. However, the other possibilities sketched above are not excluded, and at least in IX.20.3 an imperatival value of vidaḥ is likely; see comm. ad loc. I therefore put forth the alternative tr. “find resolve” for the refrain in this tṛca.
