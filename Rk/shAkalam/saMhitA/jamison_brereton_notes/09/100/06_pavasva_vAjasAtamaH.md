The first vs. of the new hymn matches the final vs. (5) of the previous one: 6ab pávasva … dhā́rayā sutáḥ enlarges on 5b pávasva soma dhā́rayā, with 5c containing sutáḥ. The 2nd hemistichs of both vss. consist primarily of datives of the gods who will drink the soma, both beginning with Indra: 5cd índrāya …, mitrā́ya váruṇāya ca; 6cd índrāya … víṣṇave, devébhyaḥ … There is also a strong echo of vs. 4: 6a vājasā́tamaḥ ‘best winner of prizes’ incorporates in a single word the simile in 4d vājī́va sānasíḥ “like a winner possessing prizes.”
