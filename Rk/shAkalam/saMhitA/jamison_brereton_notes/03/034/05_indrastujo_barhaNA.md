The metaphorical use of viveśa ‘entered’ + an action (‘thrusts’) reminds me of the somewhat slangy English “get into” for “become enthusiastic about / energetically do (some action).” The stem barháṇā- otherwise only appears as an adverbial instr. ‘mightily’, and I am tempted to take it so here (as WG seem to do), rather than as the acc. pl.

assumed in the publ. tr. However, the sandhi context is against this interpr.; note Old’s tart “Gewiss nicht barháṇā Adverb (Hiatus!).” As Ge points out, the referent of fem. gen. pl. āsām must be dhíyaḥ ‘insights’.

For insights having bright color or hue, see the passages adduced by him (n. 5d): I.143.7 śukrávarṇām dhíyam and III.39.2, where dhī́- wears silver garments. The várṇam here plays off áryam várṇam in 9d.
