As with the immed. preceding hymn, the Uṣṇih here is of the 8 8 / 12 form, with some vss. not allowing a 4-syllable final because the word breaks don’t coincide (1c, 3c, 5c) and the others not showing a syntactic or semantic break.

For the similarities with the flg. hymn, IX.105, see publ. intro. and comm. on 105.
