I take dáṃsu here and in I.141.4 as the loc. pl. of the root noun dám- ‘house’ (so also WG) rather than as adv. ‘wondrously’ (Gr, Re). Ge refuses to tr.

As with raśmíbhiḥ in I.132.5 I take raśmíṣu here as a temporal expr., contrary to the standard tr. The extended phrases in I.135.3, 137.2 support this view.

On vakṣáṇā- ‘belly’ as a pl. tantum, see comm. ad X.27.16.
