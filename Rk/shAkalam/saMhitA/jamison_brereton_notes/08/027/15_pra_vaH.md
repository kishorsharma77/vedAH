I assume that Aryaman is tacitly included with Mitra and Varuṇa in c, given the vaḥ in d (and a). In the phrase varuṇa mitra márti yam, trisyllabic márti yam is a sort of scrambling of Aryaman.

On the apparent bad cadence produced by ávidhat, see remarks ad II.1.7, where Arnold’s suggestion to read a long augment is adopted.
