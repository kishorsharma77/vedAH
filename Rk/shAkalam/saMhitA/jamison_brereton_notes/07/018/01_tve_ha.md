Pāda c contains two parallel nominal clauses. Both should be in the causal domain of the hí, but it is located only in the 2nd of the two. We might have expected \*tu vé hí gā́vaḥ sudúghās tvé áśvāḥ, which would have been just as good metrically.

On the pun in d see publ. intro. and comm. ad vs. 4.
