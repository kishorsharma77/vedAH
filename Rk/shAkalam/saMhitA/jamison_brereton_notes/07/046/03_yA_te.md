The first hemistich contains two occurrences of pári, but in fact it should technically have three: the first pári at the end of pāda a governs the preceding abl.

divás in the sense of ‘from’ (note the close sandhi divás pári); the second, in the middle of b, should be construed with both preceding cárati and following vṛṇaktu and is positioned exactly between the two clauses that contain those two verbs.

I take the hapax voc. svapivāta to the lexeme ápi √vat, which I interpr. after the manner of Tichy. See comm. ad I.128.2. The intimacy implied by this lexeme (‘be/make familiar/intimate’) is appropriate to the focus on the household disc. above.

My tr. “o you who are our familiar” does not represent the su-, but it is difficult to incorporate it without making an already heavy tr. even more so.
