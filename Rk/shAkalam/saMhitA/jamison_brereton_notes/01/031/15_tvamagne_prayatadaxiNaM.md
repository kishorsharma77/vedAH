In upamā́I prefer to see the first attestation of the root noun compound upamā́- ‘likeness’ (< ‘measure’), rather than the adverbial instrumental preferred by Old and apparently followed by the standard tr. How an instr. would function here is not clear to me, and Ge’s “der kommt zu oberst im Himmel” seems to push sópamā́ diváḥ further than the meager expression will take it. Old’s objection is that for such a root noun we would expect nom. sg. upamā́ḥ, but this isn’t apposite: in this sandhi situation upamā́would be the outcome in any case, so it is only the Pp. reading that enforces an underlying -ā́final. Moreover, the parallel compounds pramā́- and pratimā́- are attested in the RV with clear asigmatic nom. sg. (X.130.3), suggesting that they have been reinterpreted as -ā-stems (see Scar p. 378). There is no reason that an upamā́- wouldn’t have been treated similarly. See also upamā́in VIII.60.13.
