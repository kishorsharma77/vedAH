sánā is generally taken (Gr, Ge) as a neut. pl. adj. ‘old’ agreeing with bhójanāni, and this is certainly possible. I find the sentiment somewhat odd, however: to announce to Indra that the delights he has given to his client are “old” seems slighting. I prefer to interpret the word as the 2nd sg. act. impv. to √san ‘win’; exactly this form occurs several times in initial position elsewhere. What gives me pause, however, is I.178.4, which contains very parallel phraseology, sánā tā́te indra návyā ā́guḥ, and where I do interpret sánā as ‘old’. The difference there is that the poet contrasts the old deeds of Indra with the new ones (návyā) that have come and so avoids insulting the god. In any case, either the ‘old’ or the ‘win’ interpretation is possible here, though I have a preference for the latter.

The oblation of Sudās’s that was worth pursuing (vītáhavyam) in vs. 3 has now been given by him (rātáhavyāya) here, tracking the progress of the sacrifice to the point of mutual benefit of man and god.

The phrase dāśúṣe sudā́se “for the pious Sudās” displays syllabic metathesis, dā-śū / su-dā, with neutralizing play on all three sibilants. The poet seems to like this 17 collocation: see comment above on vs. 2 for connections across three verses and below on VII.20.2.
