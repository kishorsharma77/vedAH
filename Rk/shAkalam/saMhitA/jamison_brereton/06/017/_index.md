Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
15 verses: triṣṭubh, except dvipadā 15  
This hymn is divided into two roughly equal parts, with the first devoted to the  Vala myth (vss. 2–6), the second to the Vr̥tra myth (vss. 8–12). The first verse  announces these two themes in order, allotting each a half-verse. The two mythic  segments are separated by a verse about Indra’s general cosmogonic deeds (7); the  last three verses (13–15) urge Indra to use the same powers to help the poet and  his patrons. The account of both narratives emphasizes the role of soma in rousing Indra  to his great deeds, and the hymn begins with three verses (1–3) with the insistent  imperative “drink!” The Vala myth is in fact configured as a model for Indra’s  behavior in the present with the mythic deeds presented as still to happen: he is  enjoined to drill through to the cattle pen (vss. 2, 3) and to disclose the sun (vs. 3).  The hymn thus appears to be associated with the activities at dawn. The Vr̥tra myth  is more consistently presented as a deed in the past (though see vss. 8, 11).
