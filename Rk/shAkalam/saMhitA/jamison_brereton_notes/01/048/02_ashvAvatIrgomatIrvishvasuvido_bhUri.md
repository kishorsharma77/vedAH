With most tr./comm. I follow Bloomfield in interpr. viśvasuvíd- as haplology for *viśva-vasu-víd-.

The pāda break favors taking bhū́ri with the verb, as most do (e.g., Ge “geben sie sich viele Mühe”), but semantically it goes better with pāda a. Cf. expressions like bhū́ri te vásu (I.81.2, 6, VIII.32.8), bhū́ri vā́mam (I.124.12, VI.71.4), and esp.

bhū́ri … saúbhagam in 9c below.

On sūnṛ́tā- as ‘liberality, liberal (gifts)’, see Re’s discussion here (EVP III.17), summarizing previous work.
