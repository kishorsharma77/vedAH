The root √nādh ‘(cry/be) in distress’ is often used of people in dire straits (see, e.g., in Kakṣīvant’s I.118.10); here the king’s distress comes not from danger but from want of fame. There may be a touch of humor in this overdramatization of his plight, though see I.110.5 where the Ṛbhus cry out in want at an invocation, likewise seeking fame (śráva ichámānāḥ, exactly as in our 1d).

The patron-poet reciprocal bargain is managed with striking economy here: the king seeks fame in 1d, the poet receives many goods in 2abc, and the desired fame is dispatched to heaven in 2d.
