Dawn  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
This Dawn hymn contains most of the usual Dawn themes: her immediate arrival,  which awakens the world, her beauty and brightness, her daily journey, and, espe cially, her bestowal of riches on her praisers. The second half of verse 7 alludes to  the Vala myth and the release of the dawn cows (see also the Aṅgiras reference in  1d); otherwise there are no mythological elements and no mention of other gods. Although there are no particularly vivid images or striking phrases, the hymn is  pleasingly composed and contains some well-crafted phonological figures that are  unfortunately untranslatable.
