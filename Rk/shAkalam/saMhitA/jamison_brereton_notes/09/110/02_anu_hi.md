The b pāda consists of two words ending in -e, which are construed together by the standard interpr. (e.g., Ge “im grossen Reiche des Wettstreits”). But since -rā́jya- is thematic and a loc. sg., this requires mahé to belong to the rare and secondary them. stem mahá-, rather than the primary and very well-attested root stem máh-. I prefer to separate the two words and take mahé as the dat. to that stem.

There are four other occurrences of clear dat. mahé in IX.108-110 (including our vs. 7), each with a different head noun: ávase (108.14), kṣáyāya (109.3), dyumnā́ya (109.11), vā́jāya (110.7). Both because that last phrase appears in our hymn and because of the vā́jān in c of our vs., I supply ‘prize’, though other datives are possible.
