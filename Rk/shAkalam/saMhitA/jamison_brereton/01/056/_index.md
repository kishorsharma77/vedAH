Indra  
Savya Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: jagatī  
Though characterized by rare words and tortuous expressions, both defying easy  interpretation, the hymn follows a fairly straightforward trajectory. The ability of  soma to strengthen Indra for his great feats is described in the first two verses, which  also depict Indra’s journey to our sacrifice. His power in general is the subject of  the next two verses (3–4), while the last two (5–6) focus on the slaying of Vr̥tra and  its cosmogonic effects.
