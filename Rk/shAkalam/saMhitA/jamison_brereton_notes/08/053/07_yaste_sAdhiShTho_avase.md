If read with what follows, the relative clause in pāda a is even more irregular than those we have already met in the Vālakhilya. However, there is a simple solution. The identical pāda occurs as V.35.1a, where it clearly modifies krátuḥ in b: yás te sā́dhiṣṭhó ‘vasa, índra krátuṣ ṭám ā́bhara “Your resolve to help that best brings success, Indra, bring that here.” Since krátum is found in the last pāda of the preceding verse, 6d, I take the relative clause of 7a as dependent on the krátum in 6d. Unfortunately this straddles a pragātha boundary, but I find it hard to believe that the krátu association played no role in the repetition of this pāda. It is even possible that the somewhat odd bháreṣu in 7b was influenced by bhara in V.35.1b (though see 8d).
