R. N. DANDEKAR  

## Intro
The third volume of my Select Writings contains papers relating to such diverse topics as Vedic history, Vedic cxegesis, Vedic research, Vedic psychology, the Mahābhārata, and some aspects of ancient Indian tradition. For obvious reasons, these papers have not been reproduced in the chronological order of their first publication, 

It needs to be specially pointed out that I have made an attempt to render the discussion in some of the papers more complete and up-to-date mostly by means of additional foot notes. I may also mention that I have slightly modified my earlier views on a couple of points. This too has been clearly indicated. 

My sincere thanks are due to the Bhandarkar Institute Press and the Publishers for their courtesy and cooperation,

<h2 id="vedic-period-antecedents">Vedic period antecedents</h2>
<p>THE ANTECEDENTS AND THE EARLY BEGINNINGS OF THE VEDIC PERIOD</p>
<p>On this occasion,&quot; I propose to place before you, for your consideration and criticism, some of my ideas relating to the antecedents and the early beginnings of the Vedic period. A considerable amount of work of really sterling merit has been done in this field by generations of scholars — Indian as well as foreign. I am, however, inclined to think that, generally speak ing, the Vedic period has been studied, up till now, more or less as an isolated period. Efforts must now be made to fix up that period into the whole scheme of the history of India, which latter, in its turn, must be properly linked up with the history of the world. In other words, we must not study the various problems connected with the Vedic period, each by itself; we must study them all together, mutually correlating, at every stage, the results of our investigations in each case, To my mind, any attempt in the direction of reconstructing the history of the Vedic period, to the fullest possible extent and with the highest possible plausibi lity, must necessarily be governed by the consideration of the following five points : (1) The relation of the Vedic Aryan with the other Indo-European-speaking people of the world. As I shall presently endeavour to show, the Vedic period of Indian history began, in more senses than one, outside the geographical limits of India - that is to say, outside the geographical limits of the pre-15th of August India, and most certainly of the post-15th of August India.

the Indus valley civilisation. This is, indeed, very important Our knowledge of the Vedic history and civilisation is based mainly on literary sources That knowledge would gain 18 historical validity if it were possible to correlate it meapingfully with the surer facts brought to light by archaeological evidence derived during the last twenty five years. Thanks to the untiring labours of archaeologists, the Harappan civilisation now no longer re mains the abstraction that it was it is becoming possible to fill in some of the human details and thereby materially vitalize what had hitherto been an abstraction' (3) The course of the
the Vedic history and civilisation as seen from the Vedic literature itself It will be easily realised that the Vedic literature from the Roveda Samhila down to the various Vedic Sutras refers to different epochs in the Vedic age and to different strata of social life in any particular epoch We see, in the Veda, the development from the nomadic stage of life to the growth of landed aristocracy, from the tribal organisation to the conception of various advanced forms of government, from pastoral commu nities to the rise of some kind of class consciousness and class struggle, from sorcery and witchcraft to complex sophisticated ritualism, and from magic to modism All this development Deeds to be systematically and rationally explained on the basis of the Vedic literature Moreover, it has to be remembered that the Veda does not exclusively reflect the Vedic Aryan way of life and thought, but that a considerabie portion of it is the outcome of culture contacts and racial fusions In this context, we have to consider the problem of the impact on the Aryans of the Dasas, the Panis the Vratyas the Sudras, and various other non Aryan communities mentioned in the Veda, and the consequent inter racial and intra racial conflicts and reactions On such a back ground several characteristic features of the Vedic civilisation, such as, cultural rapprochement, race cooperation, class solidarity,

professional interdependence, societary planning, etc, will be con. spicuously brought out (4) The co ordination of the history of the kings and princes mentioned in the Veda with the dynastic lists of the Puranas This would also include the historical fixation of the families of the Vedic hymn-makers, priests and purohitas, and philosophers Attention may be drawn here to the antiquity of the tıhāsa purana, which goes back to the early Vedic times or even beyond It is observed that, ever since then, distinction has been made between itihasa and purāna. As is shown by one of my predecessors in this office, a careful analysis of ancient Indian historical traditions, made with reasonable caution may produce results, which would prove helpful for our purpose While re constructing the history of India prior to the Mahabharata war, which is presumed to have been fought in 1428 B C, ALTEKAR has tried to fix the dates of the dašarajña-yuddha (1900 BC), of GȚtsamada (2700 B C ), of Srñjaya Sahadeva (2000-1800 B. C), etc 6 (5) Finally, the Vedic period must be correlated with the main trend of events in the post Vedic periods of Indian his tory, such as the antecedents and consequences of the Mahā bhārata war, the rise and fall of city states indicated in the Rama yana, and the expansion of the Aryans to the various parts of India
The five points mentioned above should be made to serve as effective checks on one another A reasonably valid history of the Vedic period can be expected to emerge only from a co ordi pated consideration of the issues involved in these points
Let us take up for a brief discussion only one of these issues The relation of the Vedic Aryans with the other Indo European speaking peoples, or, to put it in general terms, the problem of the Aryans, has occupied the attention of nearly four geperations of scholars The fact that it still continues to interest scholars will become clear from the work relating to that problem which

has been produced in more recent times In 1786, Sir William JONES put forth the epoch-making suggestion regarding the possi bility of there being a common source for Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, and Germanic In 1816, Franz BOPP made the first scientific attempt to illumine the structure of Indo European (IE) and, by 1900, the primitive IE may be said to have become fairly well established It may be claimed that the science of linguistics is now no longer in an experimental stage, hazarding its hypotheses on the strength of unsatisfactory relics of speech scattered over a number of tongues The labours of linguisticians, in the course of the last more than a century, have enabled us to form a clear idea of the primitive le speech as a single and almost homogene ous language A fairly large number of words of the original speech have been reconstructed, and, in most cases, the endings, stress, and precise meaning determined This must, indeed, be regarded as one of the remarkable achievements of human intellect If, then, a single IE speech existed, there must have been people who spoke it And one may further presume that these people must have lived in a fairly compact and contiguous locality, which has been differently called the cradle', the &lsquo;home&rsquo;, or the Ur heimat' of the IE speaking people The problem of the original home of IE is thus as old as the comparative study of languages So much has been written on this subject, and so many mutually divergent theories and hypotheses bave been put forth in this connection, that one is likely to feel inclined to give up the problem as insoluble I, however, think that it is possible to evolve, out of this labyrinth of apparently divergent theories and hypotheses, a consistent and systematic pattern, and that a

time has now definitely come to attempt to do so I admit that, as has been so wisely pointed out, confession of ignorance, how ever tantalızıog, is better than assumption of knowledge But, at the same time, I do believe that, in the interest of historical pro gress, a theory, worked out on the basis of all linguistic, archaeo logical, anthropological, and culture historical material, wherever available, and with the use of what HUXLEY calls scientific imagination, wherever necessary, would be far more desirable than esther excessive caution or outright counsel of despair
The problem of IE involves, so far as it concerns the histori cal fixation of the Vedic period, the critical consideration, prie marily, of four points, namely, (1) the Urheimat of IE, (2) the Hittite problem, (3) the question of the Aryan vestiges in the Near East, particularly in Anatolia, and (4) the relations between the ancient Indians and the ancient Iranians Before I proceed with the discussion, I must make one point quite clear and that is about the exact implication of the term &lsquo;Aryan&rsquo;, which is fre quently employed by scholars in this context It will be found that, in many cases the word &lsquo;Aryan&rsquo; is used more or less as a synonym of the word &lsquo;IE: This is, to my mind not quite justi fiable — and for two reasons Firstly, the word Aryan&rsquo;, as such, is not clearly attested by the European members of the IE linguistic family, except, perhaps, through the very doubtful names, Ariovistus and Ariobriga in Celtish and Ariobiadus in old Germanic At any rate, the special coonotation, which that word gained in the proto Aryan period, such as is indicated by Vedic arja, by Avestan airja, agd also perhaps by Harri occurring 10 the Mitanni records, had not developed in the proto European period of the history of IE And secondly, the identification of the Aryans with the IE speaking people is associated with the uoscientific suggestion that the IE speakers originally formed a racially homogeneous group and the vicious and dangerous repercussions of that suggestion as seen in pan-Germanism and antı Semiticism There is overwhelming evidence to show that the IE speakers did not form a uniform biotype It is suggested that the original IE-speakers were dolichocephalic, leptorrhinian,
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
tall, bright-coloured and blue eyed blondes, who evolved out of the milieu of Northern Europe? The sponsors of this theory eventually introduced, in this context, another synonym for the words * Aryan' and &lsquo;JE&rsquo;, namely, &lsquo;Nordic&rsquo; But DIXON has convincingly shown that the Nordics were not a pure race, but that they lacluded both dolichocephalic and brachycephalic elements. It may be further pointed out that a closer ethoologi cal scrutiny leads one to the irresistible conclusion that the blond biotype did not evolve only in North Europe Blond groups of men were found among the Tartars of Europe and Asia. Simi larly, light coloured people were found among different races even in Asia There is also evidence of the existence, in ancient times, of brachycephalic people in Eastern and Central Europe The theory of Nordicism, or &ldquo;Aryadism' (as it was once understood in Germany), presupposed that the Nordıc race was intellectually far more advanced than the other races In this connection, one need only remember the wise words that the correlation between cranial contours and intellectual characters, if any, is yet to be discovered. Similarly it is not possible to connect any specific funeral custom with any particular race as has been attempted to be done by some scholars SERGI&rsquo;s suggestion that the brachyce phals from Asia were the carriers of the custom of cremation into Europeo has accordingly not received any convincing support. CHILDE has clearly shown that the custom of cremation was not restricted to any single racial group that can be definitely identified 11
7 It is linguistically unsound to suggest that the Teutons in North Europe were the original IE speakers As pointed out by Frist (Indogermanen und Gamane 1, PP 16-51 ) a study of the consonant system in ancient German clearly shows that that language had evolved out of the contact of the IE-speakers with the original inhabitants of Germany HIRT also speaks of the subjugation of the original Germans by an allen people (the Celts?), which influenced the language of the former (Die Indogermanen II, p 616) Also gec W KRAUSE, “Die Herkunft der Germanen JBAIVG 1940-41, PP 18-36

ANTECEDENTS OF THE VEDIC PERIOD
To approach this question from another angle, it may be pointed out that all Nordics did not speak IE languages. The Fings, for instance, were Nordic but cannot be said to bave been the speakers of an IE language. Conversely all the IE-speakers were not Nordics or dolichocephalic blondes. As a matter of fact, even all Nordics were not blondes. The oldest proof of the appearance of the IE-speakers is to be found in the the Egyptian sculpture belonging to the latter half of the second millennium B,C. There they are shown to be brachycephalic. Among the seers of the Veda, who must pecessarily be regarded as IE-spea. kers, several seem to have been dark in colour. The Indian caste system also, by no means, represents the division of society according to biotypes. There is another proof of the appearance of an IE-speaking people. It is to be found on the lower column of the victory of Tiglat-Pileser IV of Assyria in 800 B. C. There they are represented as dark-coloured type of men. The ancient Persians, who were clearly IE-speakers, are shown with black beards in the mosaic pictures of Pompey. The speakers of the Hittite language, which was a proto-IE dialect, consisted mainly of men belonging to the Armenoid race. As depicted in sculpture, they appear broad-skulled, long or hook-nosed, middle-sized, stocky-built men. We have, therefore, to conclude that there did not exist aoy IE race as such. Several distinct races - Nordic, Alpine, South-European, and Asiatic Mediterranean &ndash;spoke je languages, 18 All racial considerations have, therefore, to be scrupulously eschewed while dealing with the problem of IE.228 We have to depend, in this connection, principally on the evidence supplied by linguistics, archaeology, anthropology, and compara tive folllorc. Linguistic palacontology, by itself, is fraught with several pitfalls. Therefore, the results of the investigations in ail the four scicnces mentioned above must be pooled together and checked and counter-checked. Thus alone may we hope to derive</li>

It is not possible here to undertake a detailed examination of the several theories relating to the IE Urhetmat which have been put forth by scholars till now 13 Nor is it necessary What I should like to do is merely to attempt a restatement, in a consis tent and constructive form, of the results of the many investiga tions made with reference to this oroblem To begin with, it may be pointed out that the Arctic home theory is now entirely discoun tenanced by scholars — and quite rightly too 184 But the theory that the onginal home of the Aryans was India atself is being still put forth - more vigorously now, perhaps owing to nationalistic

<li>[TILAK has set forth this theory about the original habitat of the Asyans in The Arche Home in the Vedas (Poona, 1903) He bas durved hus cvidence primarily from astronomy and geology According to &lsquo;TILAK, certain phenomena of nature which are reflected 20 the Vedic mythology could have occurred only in the Arctic region. From the astronomical references in the Vedic texts, TILAK has arrived at 6000-5000 B C as the date of the Vedic mantras ( Onion or the Researches iria the Antigulies of the I edas, Tadic Chronology, Hurts and Suggestions or Sedanga Jonska) During the interval between the two glacial cpochs, which may be called inter-glacial cpoch and which the geologists assign to some time before 10,000 BC, that is. at least five thousand years before the beginning of the intra period, the ancestors of the Vedic scers must have lived in the Arctic region The second glacial cpoch which began about 10,000 B C marked the end of the Arctic home of the Aryans and the beginning of their large scale migrations from among these Aryan immi grants, the Vedic and the Iranian Aryans have preserved in their ancient Iteratures the memories of the phenomena of nature which their ancestors had witnessed in the Arctic region over five thousand years ago
This hypothesis put forth by TILAK does not seem to have received appro bation from scholars. However, I J S TARAPOREWALA bay tried to advance (u The IE homcland a restatement of the question,&rdquo; PAIOC 6, PP 635-42 ) some evidence from the adidad un support of the Arctic home VM APTE (QJMS 51, pp 47-54) derives support for the Arctic home theory from the evidence brought forth by the geophysicist M Ewing and gcologist meteorologist W Dovy (9000 B C as the date for the freezing of the Arctic occan)

<p>sentiments. The main argument of the sponsors of this theory is that, in the Vedic, or, for the matter of that, in the cntirc ancient Indian literature, there is not thc rcmotest hint of the original home of the makers of that literature having been outside India. This argument can be met, I think, satisfactorily, by showing that, when the Vedic Aryans entered into the Saptasındhu country, they could not have had any consciousness that they were entering into a new land in their case, as will be pointed out in the sequel, it was a matter of gradual crpansion from their secondary Urheimat, and not of entry into a forcign land Apart from this, may it not be asked why, if the Aryans migrated out of India, as they must be assumed to have donc according to this theory, there should be no clear reference to such migrations in ancient Indian literature? To assumc further that the Vedic language is the most archaic form -almost the original primitive form - of it is to negate the entire body of results of the science of linguistics. Such an assumption can ill explain the devclop ment of individual IE languages Thc astronomical cvidence, produced to prove the hoary antiquity of the Veda, has always appeared to me to be of doubtful validity. We obscnc that there are perhaps as many dates proposed for the Veda on the basis of that cvidence as there are scholars who have approached this problem from the point of vicw of astronomy! Morcover such a high antiquity for the Veda is not likely to fit in well with the
(Continued from the last page) of peace and stability, the raemories of the experiences of their ancestors un the Arctic region And why, at may be asked, should these memories have been preserved specifically by the Vedic and the Iranian Aryana? It may also be pointed out that CROLL&rsquo;s views regarding the succesuon of glacial and inter glacial cpochs during the Pleistocepe period, which form the bases of TILAK&rsquo;s hypothesis, are now generally discarded The fourth and last Ice age 13 now believed to have occurred about 50,000 B C. (Cf H G WEL14, The Outline of History, p 99 ) Crucs have further expressed doubt regarding the availability of sufficient habitable space near the North l&rsquo;olc for the Aryan settlements The primarily baturalistic and astronomical interpretation of the Vedic mantras, which TILAK adopts, 13 also not much favoured by the modera Vedusts (see DANDEKAR, Vedur Mythological Tracts, 1979) But the major defect of Tilak&rsquo;s theory is that it has completely ignored the linguistic and archacological aspects of the question.]

It is also difficult to understand why, if writing was so common in the Indus civilisa tion, it is not cycn rcferred 10 in the Vedic litcraturc It would bc hardly justifiable to say that there was no occasion in the Veda to refer to writing Similarly thc obvous iconism of the Indus valley ill accords with the cmphatically aniconic religion of the Veda From the anthropological point of view also, it would be a tall claim to say that, in India, man had attained to a high level of civilisation, long beforc 6000 D C (the date indicated for the Veda by somc astronomical cvidence). when the off-shoots from the same stoch, at least from the linguistic point of view, still showcd a lower type of civilisation cien much later, The carly Veda, as a matter of fact, presents a picture of the life of nomadic tribes And, as will be shown subsequently, this fact can be understood in its proper perspective only on the assump tion that the Vedic Aryans were not autochthonous in India 116

( Continurd from the last page) hint of the migration of the Argans into Indi Apart from the essentially negative character of thu argument, it may be pointed out that the Aryan migration into lodia, though not explicitly mentioned in literature, is clearly suggested by several other facts Conuder, for instance, tic semanuc develop ment of the word dasa Dasa or Dihat was originally the mimc of a tribe in West Asia which was antagonistic to the Aryans In course of time, this proper name came to be used as a common noun and denoted in the Agreda an cncmy in general Sulf later, the word dusa came to denot a person who was dcfeated and made a slave (In this last scnsc, the word occurs oply threc times in the Rgreda ) &ldquo;These successi\c changes in the mcaning of the word dasa would clearly indicate the victorious march of thc Aryans towards India Such mythological details as the conflict between the Varupa cult and the lodra cult, thc risc of Indra to the supreme position in the Vedic mytho logy, and the representation of Indra as a demon in the Iranian mythology can be properly understood only on the assumption that Mic Vedic Aryans and the Iranian Araps had separatcu cren before the former migrated to Saptasındhu The statement made with reference to the Bharatas, namely, praca gaiyanlat pythuparfaro yayuh (R' VII 23 1) is also very suggestive in this context (For a fuller discussion of all thesc points, icc DANDERAR, &ldquo;Asura Varuna&rdquo; and &quot; Viraha Indra, Vedic Mythological Tracts ) Further, it may be incidentally pointed out that hardly any reference to the migration of the Aryans out of India occurs in carly Indian literaturo As for the absence outside India or any religious places specifically related to the carly Ved c Aryans we hardly come across any cven in India atself Moreover, in this connection we must takc into account the nomadic tribal character of the life of the Vedic Aryans on their way to Saptasındhu The Nadi sulla us obviously a latc hymn and contains what may be called the backward recounting of the rivers by the poet after he bad reached thc Gangetic valley at the end of the early Vedic period And, finally, if the Aryans were believed to have originally belonged to India one would have to assume that Vedic Sanskrit represented the most primary form of IC and that the Harappan civilisation was post Vedic But the latest researches in linguistic and archacology do not permit such assumption ]

&ldquo;that the IE-speakers entered into Germany as a minority and imposed their speech on a pre-existing population 18 Culturally, too, the ancient Germanic-speakers could not have been the direct representatives of the original IE-speakers The battle-axe or the IEs is certainly not derived from Germany. Morcover, the ancient Teutons were not particularly fond of horses — a charac teristic which betrays that they were not the original IES In their social organisation also one notices a significant departure from the rigidly patrilinear organisation of the IESIt is further to be remembered that archaeological investigations have now proved that the Nordic neolithic culture began latc as compared to the British and the Danubian, and only when the neolithic economy had been left behind in the East Mediterranean and Hither Asia 17
The Urheimat of the IEs must, therefore, be sought else where. The suggestion of GILESIS that Hungary may have a claim to that honour is mainly based on to assumptions : firstly, the original IEs followed the custom of cremation and that custom bas radiated out from Hungary, and secondly, Hungary, which was an agricultural country, must be regarded suitablc for the breeding of horse and sheep 19 Against this hypothesis of GILES, it may be asked : Why should a settled agricultural community have at all migrated out of Hungary? Why is there no attestation, ia the early E speech, of fish and fish-eating, which must have always been a prominent feature of the life in that region ?

traces of arrow heads or other weapons which were clearly known to the IE-speakers 20 On the other hand, we find, in the early Danubian culture, traces of the worship of the Mother-Goddess, which was unknown to the IES As a matter of fact, the very mentality of the Hungarian peasants must be regarded as not having been quite consistent with the activities of the warlıke IE nomads 204
20 There also no sufficient evidence to support the 25$umption that the Custom of cremation originated in Hungary On the other hand, evidence bas pow become avauable which indicates that the original IL speakers buried their dead And why should Hungary alone be considered to have been suitable for the breeding of horse and cattle?
20a [ Paul Tiname has approached the question of the Urhebat primarily from the point of view of semantics Die Heimat der indogerinanischen Gemeinsprache, Wiesbaden, 1954) He argues somewhat like this There are in an IE language some words which are without doubt ur IE in character &ldquo;The objects originally denoted by these ur IE words were, however, not available in the region in which that IE language was used in historical times As a result of this those words card to be assigned different meanings in that language Naturally cnough the region in which that IE language was used cannot have been the Urheimat of the original IE speakers By way of example, THEME has mentioned, in this connection the ur IE word *bh sgos - (= beech) and its cognates like Latin fogus, German boka, and Greek fagas Greek sagas came to denote a tree different from ( but more or less gunilar to ) beech because becch was not available in Greece, while in Latin and German that word retained its orginal mean ng bccausc beech grew in the regions in which those languages were used Therefore, according to THIEME, Greecc cannot bave been the Urheimat THEVE has set forth another criterion A certain object is available only 19 a certain region And though some IE language was spoken in that region, the word denoting that object was definitely non IE Such a region also cannot have been the Urheimat Theme has applied these two crieria to the various reg ons which have been suggested by scholars was the ongnal homes and has thereby arrived at the northern part of Central and East Furope and South Russia as the two most probablc claimants He bas then made a critical study of the UT IE *laks falso, which word, according to him, originally denoted salmon The Sanskrit form of that ur-IE word, namely, laksa / laksa did not deagte salmon because there were no salmon in India, but it was assigned meanings which could be derived albcit indirectly from the two characteristics of salmon namely, plcnitude (laksa) and redness laks) In brief, THEME concludes that the Urheimat or I must be sought for in a region in which salmon were available in abundance Such a region is the one which extends towards the cast and the north sca, to the west of the beech boundary and to the cast of the Ricin that is to say, the region watcred by the rivers Weichsel, Oder, Elbe, and leser

To approach the problem a little differently, let us first try to reconstruct a picture of the habitat and the life of the carly IES on the basis of the latest linguistic researches., We may then get our results tested and checked, and, if possible, confirmed by archaeological, anthropological, and culture-historical cvidence.21 The early IEs must have been most certainly nomadic. Other wise the question of their migrations would not have arisco so conspicuously. Their original home must, therefore, be well adapted for nomadic people. It must allow sufficient scope for extension of tribes in various directions. Further, the latest linguistic rescarches have shonn that the IE speech, before it was divided into different linguistic groups, must have been subjected to a threefold influence. There is, first of all, the influence from Mesopotamia. For instance, IE words like *astar and *peleku show clear aflinity with Akkadian islitar and Assyrian pilakku?? respectively. The carly IE vocabulary is also
(Continued from the last page) Onc objection which may be reasonably raised against Tinese&rsquo;s hypothe sis is that it is based on isolated and specific, instead of on cumulative and representative, cvidence Again, if the ur-It word laks- / lalso- was to common and important, why is it not attested in s-scral early IC languages ? If necessary, it could bave represented some notion different from that or salmon, as in Sanskrit. The connection of the redness of salmon and latud too is farfetched (See in this connection. A MAYRIIOFER, &quot; Altindisch Latti,&rdquo; ZDMG 105, 175-83.) Further, it would sccm strange that ur IC should have a word for a specific Lind of fish but not for fish as such.

particularly favourable for the breeding of goat and shccp The wide use of the latter by the primitive IE speakers would show that the original IE tribes stretched from the steppes in the east to the hilly tracts in the west 29 The trans Caspian wild sheep still has a range from the Ust Urt plateau to Turkistan, and, it is possible that in earlier times, it had extended further north to the Spurs of the Urals As a matter of fact, it is impossible to localise some of the animals, which were so common to the IEs, in any other region * The animals which were presumably unknown to the IEs, such as, tiger, leopard, and camel, also point to the Urheimat having been located in the Ural-Altaic region
At this stage, a reference needs to be made to an objection which may be raised against the foregoing hypothesis It may be suggested that, since honey was so common among the IEs, their original home must be located near the Black Sea, where there must have been an abundance of lime-trees to attract bees $1 But it is quite plausible that the IE *medu was not honey, but just a juice of some kind of berries The word could have derived the specie fic sense of &lsquo;honey&rsquo; only in its later semantic development &quot;

Turning to the flora known to the primitive IEs, one would at once be struck by the fact that the IEs were not familiar with big forests Further, there is, in the IE speech, complete abscnce of words for fruit trecs It can be shown that there are no common words in the IC dialects for the flora belonging specifically to Europe All this again fits in well with thc hypothesis that the Urheimat of the IEs was the northern Ural Altaic region HIRT&rsquo;S becch argument docs not go against thit hypothesis, for, it can be shown that beech was unknown to the early IE There should also be no difficulty regarding the birch, for, it grows freely in northern steppes SS The fact that the early [Es did not possess any knowledge of agriculture would support the assump

tion about their Kirghiz Urheimat It was only later, when some JE tribes migrated to the West, that they became acquainted with plough and other agricultural implements The main occupation of the proto-IEs was cattle breeding, and they must have herded cattle on the grassy steppes The original habitat of the IEs, as indicated by linguistic palaeontology, must have been rocky in formation, with rushing torrents There were no fixed path-ways, and the region generally required free but quick movements, and travel by wagons The climate was continental with not much rain and damp The diseases were few, the most common haying been limpiog' and &lsquo;bent Thus the geological character, the climate, and the general way of life accord well with the hypo thesis that the original home of the IE speakers was located in the North Kirghiz steppes The poor condition of vegetation in that region must have necessitated large scale migrations and movements of herds 36
36 W BRANDENSTEIN has approached the question of the Urheimat of the IEs from the point of view of what may be called applied semantics (&ldquo;Die Lebensforrnen der Indogermanen&rsquo;, in Die Indogermanen und Germanen frage PP 231-277, Du erste ir dogermanische Vanderung, 1936) His method is something like this Onc traces the semantic development of the original IE words in the various later IE languages and then determines from a study of that development the basic meanings of those words A picture is then reconstructed of the civilisation of the IE speakers Of course, it is assumed that the meaning of a word develops in a certain specific order For instance, it is quite understandable that a word like paru comes to mcan, in course of tune, wealth', but it cannot happen the other way round Proceeding on these lines, BRANDENSTEIN has put forth the view that the proto Aryans (who are also referred to as proto Indo-Iraniang) must have been the first to separate themselves from the proto IE3 According to that scholar, one has to think of two main periods in the history of the proto IEs one before the proto Aryans had separated therdselves from the original IL stock and the other after they had separated themeslves The original meanings of many proto IL words have been preserved in the pruto Aryan language be. cause the physical environments and the gereral way of life of the proto Aryans were, to a large extent, sunular to those of the proto IES On the other hand, those proto IE words developed different meanings in the IE Languages of Lurope because the phys cal environments of the speakers of these latter were different from those of the proto-IEs Therefore, if a parti cular word has the same meaning in the proto Aryan language and any

What archaeological and anthropological evidence do we find in support of the results derived from linguistic evidence? In the Near East and Europe, valuable archaeological evidence has been obtained in many ways, but principally through the exami nation of graves and their contents As CHILDE points out, the mode of the disposal of the dead is often regarded as one of the most fundamental customs of a people and one that they would tenaciously preserve 87 The earliest method of the disposal of the dead practised by the JEs was to bury the dead in single graves Over such graves holding the body of the departed, they used to throw a mound of earth dug out from a surrounding ditch. They
(Continued from the last page) other IE language, onc may reasonably presume that that word must have had the same meaning in the original IC Adopting this methodology, BRANDENSTEIN has arrived at some proto IE words and their meanings and has thereby inferred some aspects of the life of the speakers of that language, For instance, according to him, the home of the proto ICs was located in a hilly and rocky region with rapid streams of water At the foot of the hills there were farly wide plains which facılıtated their movements with cattle. There were no regular roads, and so those people used rough wagons (Sk anas) A consideration of such words as set, *melg *agros, *mel, etc, has led BRANDENSTEIN to the conclusion that the proto IEs were not conversant with agriculture In short, it may be stated that the various characteristic features of the habitat of the proto IEs which BRANDENSTEIN has mentioned, clearly point to the North Kirghiz region They also show that the original IE speakers were aomadic cattle breeders and sheep breeders
Incidentally, it may be pointed out that Giles rejects the view that the original IE speakers were nomadic cattle breeders and sheep breeders (CHI 1, 67–68) KEITH (&ldquo;The home of the Indo Europeans', Pauty Comm Vol, p 191 ) also thinks that those people had settled down in their orig nal habitat and had developed quite a strong social organization They migrated from there either on account of the invasions of foreign tribes or on account of the lack of space for the exp1nsion of settlements W J PERRY (The Growth of Civilization, 1923) has advanced the view that the civilisation of nomadic cattle breeders and sheep breeders is later than that of the settled agriculturists Specht (Sprachliches zur Urheimat der Indo germanen', KZ 66 1-74) has raised many objections mainly on the basis of linguistics against BRANDENSTEIN s hypothesis In his rejoinder (12 66, 195-96), BRANDENSTEIN has reiterated thc view that the original home of the IE speakers must be sought for on the European side of the Ural mountain He strongly discountenances the Asian home theory (See f

seem to have been also in the habit of surrounding the mounds with one, or perhaps two, timber fences in the Rgveda also (X 18 4 and 18. 13), we get attestation of a similar procedure, which fact may be regarded as a proof of its having been widely in vogue even among the distant members of the IE family The Kirghiz steppes are thickly dotted with such

It may, however, be mentioned that some scholars have also produced linguistic, archaeological, anthropological, and culture-bistorical evidence which points to two other regions which seem to fulfil the necessary conditions for the Urheimat. But a closer and more critical examination of that evidence convincingly shows that those regions could liave only been what may be called the secondary&rsquo; Urheimats. A comparative study of the European members of the IE linguistic family shows that the speakers of those dialects had separated from the main stock and had marched into low and marshy regions at a sufficiently early date, Words for damp and rain have increased in those western IE dialects. Their new habitat was more extended and presented a different type of flora and fauna. Stuart E, MANN has made a careful study of the IE cognate languages, mainly dealing with some of the names of wild animals, trees, plants, domestic animals, and tools and devices, with a view to arriving at an approximate location of the primitive home of the speakers of these dialects, by a process of elimination 11 According to him, those people had no common words for tropical and sub tropical vegetation and fauna. They lived a highly organised life, reared cattle, sheep, pig, and goat, and kept dogs. They made carts of wood, complete with wheels, rims, axle, and yoke. They ploughed land, sowed seed, and reaped the harvest. Their tools had reached a certain degree of excellence All this would, accord ing to MANN, unmistakably point to the Baltic plain having been the Urheimat.
The Baltic plain, however, could not have been the primary Urheimat. Firstly, the primitive IEs do not seem to have had any contact with sea. The primitive IE speech has no words for sea &lsquo;, &lsquo;fish&rsquo;, or &ldquo;salt&rsquo;. Secondly, highly organised life and agriculture do not accord well with the life of the primi tive IỆs as reconstructed above. The climate, land, flora, and fauna also are of different character. On the other hand, the linguistic evidence, produced by MANN, is not insignificant.

It certainly favours the Pripet region If, however, we were to go deeper into the evidence produced by MANN, we would find that he has taken into account primarily the European members of the IE linguistic family 43 The conclusion is, therefore, irresi stible that the ancestors of the speakers of those dialects separated from the main stock migrated into the Pripet region, and settled down in that region, 10 unity, for a considerable length of time In other words, the Pripet region was a sort of Urheimat of the forerunners of the European members of the IE famıly It was thus only a secondary Urhemat Those tribes must have migrat ed to the Pripet region along the northern coast of the Caspian sea and through South Russia The Volga-Dnieper valley in South Russia, again, could not have been their original habitat, la because the same objections, as have been put forward above against the Baltic region theory, would hold good even in that case South Russian region was used essentially as a passage The Tripolje culture of the Volga Dnieper valley, which presents close resemblance to the primitive IE culture, indicates the west ward march of one great migration of the IE speakers
Even prior to this major migration into the Pripet region, however, there must have taken place a major migration from the Urheimat in the south eastern direction in this latter case, the immigraots did not experience much radical change in the matter of geological conditions, climate, flora, and fauna.

gion around Balkh, where these tribes migrated and settled down, was just the south-eastern end of the series of steppes originally inhabited by the primitive JEs. From the Balkh region, a rolling grass-covered steppe stretches westward to the eastern shore of the Caspian sea. &ldquo;From this steppe, passing northwards along the coast of the Caspian, it is usually possible to pass by means of dry steppe or salt desert round the northern end of that sea to the Volga, whence another steppe stretches westwards as far as the Dnieper, and for some way northwards until it passes by means of a belt of park-land into the dense deciduous forest that occupied the most of Central Russia. &quot; That the speakers of some members of the IE linguistic family settled in the region around Balkh, for a considerably long time, can be proved on the strength of linguistic, archaeological, and anthropological evi dence. As a matter of fact, some scholars are inclined to believe that it was the Urheimat of the primitive IEs 432 In that region, one comes across a large number of graves with mounds, around which are placed one or more, mostly two, circular timber fences, Linguistically also it is shown that the ancestors of the speakers of the Eastern group of IE dialects – whom later history entitles us to name proto-Aryans-separated from the main body of the primitive IEs, leaving behind the remaining stock of the IE speakers in the original home. A study of the meanings of certain words and roots in the original IE speech, on the one hand, and, in the immediate ancestor of the Aryan dialects, on the other, clearly proves that the original meanings of the former were retained in the latter, while those roots and words had deve loped newer meanings in the European members of the IE lingui stic family. We may, therefore, draw two conclusions in this regard : Firstly, the proto-Aryans must have separated from the main stock earlier than the speakers of the early European IE

dialects, and, secondly, the proto-Aryans must have migrated to a region which was not radically different from the JE Urher mat As will be shown in the sequel, the further course of events in the history of the Aryans clearly points to that region having been the region round Balkh Archaeologically also, the Balkh region 079 be the proper connecting link between the Urheimat, on the one hand, and the different localities to which the proto Aryans migrated later on on the other the investigations made by HEINE GELDERN In this connection are highly suggestive and helpful for the reconstruction of the history of the Aryans It appears that these tribes merely moved southwards from their habitat via the Jaxartes and the Oxus The region around Balkh was, therefore, not the primary Urheimat of the IEs It was only a secondary Urheimat, but, in a sense, it can be regarded as the Urheimat of the proto Aryans
To recapitulate we may say that linguistic, archaeological, anthropological, and culture historical evidence entitles us to as sume that the North Kirghiz steppes, between the Urals and Altai, was the home of the IEs whom, as will be shown later, we shall have to call, more precisely, the proto IES This was the primary Urheimat From this region, the first major migration started in the south eastero direction - the immigrants having uiti mately settled down in the Balkh region, before their further migrations It was thus a secondary Urheimat, or, in a sease, the Urheimat of the proto-Aryans The other major migration passed through the Volga Dnieper valley, and the immigrants settled 10 the Pripet region, prior to their further separation It was, there fore, another secondary Urhelmat It should, however, be borde in mind that even before these two major migrations took place, there had occurred an isolated migration that of the Hittites, which we shall consider presently But before that isolated mig ration is taken up for consideration, it may be, incidentally, pointed out that, on the strength of the evidence provided by the facts that

the proto-Hellenes can be shown to have entered Greece in about 2200 B C., that the Hittites, as will be soon pointed out, started on their isolated migration in about 2800 B, C., and that the proto Aryans must be assumed to have separated from the main stock in about 2600 B. C., tlie proto-IE unity can be, with reasonable cer tainty, dated at 4000-3500 B, C.45
The Tocharian dialect, which was brought to light in com paratively recent years, should present no difficulty for the foregoing hypothesis. The facts of morphology show that Tocha rian bears close affinity to Slavonic and Armenian. It was be lieved that Tocharian belonged to the centum group of the IE cognate languages. Recent researches in linguistics, however, tend to show that the division of the IE languages into centum and satem groups is not very valid. Even as it is, there is eviden ce to show that Tocharian was a satem language. On the whole, it may be assumed that the proto-Tocharians first turned west wards, weat up to the Dnieper, but thence retraced their steps and started towards Central Asia.46a That would explain why their

TRUBETZROY suggests ( AL 1, 81-89 ) that the IE languages may owe theit common traits to later contacts just as well as to common descent. These views, bowever, are unacceptable.

Turning now to the Hittite problem, we find that four main stages can be distinctly marked in the bistory of that problem (1) Already, in the eighties of the last century, two cuneiform tablets discovered in the Egyptian state archive, popularly called the Arzawa letters, were known to the world of scholars. Even as early as 1902, KNUDTZEN had tried to interpret those letters and had declared their language to be JE in character But greater impetus was given to the study of this problem by the discovery by Hugo WINCKLER, 10 1906-07, of the great state archive of the Chattı empire containing more than 10,000 cupel form tablets The script of the tablets was Accadian cuneiform, and the language more or less similar to that of the Arzawa letters Unfortunately WINCKLER died before he could apply himself to a deeper and closer study of the tablets (2) The second stage in the history of the problem is marked by the publi cation, in 1916, of the monumental work of HROZNY wherein that scholar calls the language the Hittite language, definitely fixes its IE character, and presents, in a systematic manner, its main features from the linguistic pojat of view 47 (3) la the third

stage, a more scientific approach was made towards the problem by Ferdinand SOMMER of München who combined in himself profound knowledge both of IE linguistics and Assyriology. (4) The fourth, and perhaps the fipal, stage is characterised by the outstanding contributions made in this field by American lingui sticians - more particularly by STURTEVANT.
The sources for the study of the Hittite problem are mainly three, namely, the 10,000 or more cuneiform tablets from the state archives of the Chatti empire; the Arzawa letters discovered at El-Amarna; and the fragments of lexicons in which Sumero-Akka dian words are explained by means of corresponding Hittite words. For the sake of the convenience of discussion, the results of the investigations in this field may be, with advantage, classi fied under three heads : racial affinities of the Hittites; the Hittite language; and the history and general culture of the Hittites.
As indicated elsewhere, while dealing with the IE problem, it is always desirable to avoid, as far as possible, all enthnologi cal speculations It may, bowever, be incidentally pointed out that the Hittites, that is, the speakers of the Hittite language, seem to show three racial layers - the original Mediterranean racial type was superimposed by the brachycephalic Armenoid type, which, in its turn, was superimposed by the nomadic Turks. As a matter of fact, there is reason to believe that this kind of mixed racial set up has persisted in Asia Minor throughout, even in spite of the linguistic vicissitudes which have occurred in that region, and persists even to this day. The study of the Hittite language is obviously more important from our point of view. It should be remembered, at the very outset, that the cuneiform tablets discovered by WINCKLER present not one but at least eight different linguistic types out of which we are concerned, at this stage, only with Hittite and perhaps Luvian. A superficial study of Hittite led scholars to suggest that it was a hybrid language, which shows considerable affinity with the primitive IE but which cannot be clearly assigned to any specific IE

sub-group, or that it was a Caucasian language with Aryan influence on it 49 There were also observed in that language certain Mongolian traits, and, consequently, its close connection with Tocharian was assumed A deeper and more scientific study of Hittite has, however, brought out the following main features of that language It bears close affinity with the so called centum group of the IE dialects In the field of voca lism, it is more akin to the western IE group. There is no feminine gender in it The character of the plural number is 20 complete, and only faint traces of the dual can be observed. It possesses a peculiar &lsquo;H&rsquo; sound Its verbal system and case system appear to have been of a much simplified character. There is only a small number of tenses and almost complete ab sence of moods. Though, from the point of view of phonology and vocabulary, the IE character of Hittite may not be quite evident, its grammatical structure definitely proves that it belongs to the IE family. It is an IE language in its flexional structure 50 There can be hardly any doubt that Hittite is the earliest off-shoot of the IE family that can be attested. Its special peculiarities, some of which are mentioned above, are not to be regarded as in dicating deterioration or aberration of any IE speech, but they can be scientifically explained to have been the result of a natural process of development of an earlier stage of the IE speech as has now been reconstructed. When compared with the other members of the IE linguistic family, Hittite appears distinctly primitive in character. We have, therefore, to conclude that its origis and early development more or less coincide with the origin and development of the IE speech it self. In other words, it is a sister, rather than a daughter, of the ur-IE, existing side by side with it, prior to the emergence of the proto-Aryan and the proto-European IE language-groups. The Mongolian or Altaic influence on Hittite can now be understood in its proper perspective, for, a similar influence has already been shown to have worked on the primitive IE We may, therefore,

31
now put the whole history of the Hittite language like this: From a hypothetical language, which must now be called proto JE language, there developed, in course of time, two languages, namely, the IE and the Hittite &ndash; one hypothetically reconstructed and the other now actually attested by records.1 The Hittite speakers must have separated from the IE-speakers almost in the initial stage of the development of the two languages, presumably some time between 2800 and 2600 B. C., migrated in the south western direction, and eventually settled in Asia Minor. They must have entered that region along the north coast of the Cas piap sea and across the Caucasus, it is impossible to accept the suggestion, made by SCHACHERMEYR, that the Hittites entered Asis Minor via west,52 There is to be found no trace of theirs in the west. And, further, why should they have proceeded to Asia Minor abandoning the rich plains of the west which they are as sumed to have crossed? in Asia Minor, the Hittites seem to have been soon absorbed among the indigeneous people of that region, and, though their language preserved much of its original character on ing, perhaps, to its superiority, it was not a little in fluenced by the languages of Asia Minor and the surrounding localities. The affinity, which Hittite bears to the western group of IE languages, thus becomes easily understandable.
These conclusions arrived at on the basis of the study of the Hittite language are fully confirmed by the history of the Hittite people as can be reconstructed from the sources mentioned above, The fact that the Hittites, under Mursitis I, conquered Babylon in 1760 B. C. by overpowering the dynasty of Hammurabi would indicate that they must have set up a powerful empire in Asia Minor, at least a few centuries before that event. The subjugation of a powerful dynasty like Hammurabi&rsquo;s could not have been
51. The discos cry of Hittite has given rise to the assumption by some scholars of a pCW stage in the genealogical scheme of the Indo European languages, namely that of primitive Indo Hittite, which preceded proto-IC, this latter having further developed, on the one hand, in Uic direction of proto-Hittite, and, on the other, of IE as reconstructed from Sanskrit, Greek, Laun, etc. CF, S.

achieved otherwise. It may further be pointed out in this connec tion that the records of the Hittites, which begin from 1900 B. C., do not show any consciousness on their part that they were immigrants in that locality They must have, therefore, settled there some centuries prior to 1900 B, C. It will thus be not too much to presume that the Hittites entered Asia Minor between 2800 and 2600 B. C. We are not particularly concerned with the events in the history of the Hittites. We may only add that, in the earliest period of their history, the Hittites were influenced by the Assyrians from Cappadocia; that, in the glorious regime of their illustrious king, Subbiluliumaš, they concluded a peace treaty with the Mitannis, who were, from the linguistic point of view, distantly related to them; and that, by about 1230 B, C., their power began to dwindle until at last it disappeared complete ly after a quarter of a century,
This brief review of the Hittite problem will now enable us to understand properly how and why some IE names can be dis covered in the Hittite mythology; how and why the Hittite religion presents some apparent resemblances to that of the Mingan Greeks who were not IE-speakers; and how and why their culture was so significantly akin to the Babylonian culture.
Mention has already been made of the sensational discovery of records made during the two decades before and after the beginning of this century in Asia Minor and the surrounding locality. The linguistic, historical, and other related facts, which have been brought to light by these records, have materially changed the conventional ideas about the JE problem. One very striking result of the new investigations based upon these records, namely, the Hittite problem, and its significance, have been already referred to. Some of these records have further brought to light nanies of kings, places, and gods, and certain other words, in the dialects employed in them, which indicate surpris ing resemblance between these dialects and the IE languages which had already become quite well known from the ancient literatures of Irdia and Iran, in other words, the languages be longing to the proto-Aryan group. We have to confess that the
ANTECEDENTS OF THB VEDIC PERIOD
33
material at our disposal in this connection is not much, and that, therefore, no very definite results may be expected from the study of that material. At the same time, it must be pointed out that whatever conclusions can be reasonably drawn on the strength of that material are quite revealing so far as the history of the IEs -or, more particularly, the history of the Aryans - is concerned.
Let us first collect together all the relevant information about the tribe which is known to history as the Kassites. The Kassites lived in Zagros mountains, between Media and Babylonia. As for their language, which is, for our purpose, of greater value, only forty words in it can be attested with some amount of certainty. DELITZSCH and SCHEFTELOWITZ, who have made a special study of those words, feel no doubt about their IE character.53 It is observed that, in some vocal and gutteral sounds, the Kassite language comes nearer to the Vedic language than to any other language, and that there are, in it, no traces of specific Iranian and Armenian peculiarities. That, in its essential form, the Kassite language has no connection with Sumerian and Elamite would become obvious even from a casual study of it. In its yocabulary, Kassite seems to have preserved mapy archaic Aryan words, though some of them are seen to have been lost in the later developments of the Aryan speech. But far more sigoificant than all this are the Kassite names. Attention may be drawn only to a few of them. Šurias, Marattaš, Šumalia, Suquamuna, and Abirattaš remind us, for instance, respectively of Sanskrit Sürya, Marut, Sumall, Su( so Jcamāna, and Abhiratha. The word bugas in compounds corresponds with Sanskrit bhaga. This linguistic evidence should, therefore, leave no doubt about the fact that the Kassite language had been a member of the same group of IE languages to which the Vedic Sanskrit be longed. In other words, the Kassite language must have been 30 off-shoot of the proto-Aryan language. When could the speakers of Kassite have separated from the main stock of the proto-Aryans? The history of the Kassites tells us of their conquest

of Babylon by the end of the eighteenth century BC. It would, therefore, be necessary to assume that they had come and settled in those parts of western Asia sufficiently long before that event.ssa Another fact also must be taken into account in this connection, namely, that the records of the Kassites show that they were almost submerged into the indigenous population of that region. Only some basic features of the Aryan speech and culture seem to have been retained in their speech and culture. This fact would indicate, not that they were not essentially Aryan in character, but that they must have lived among the peoples of that region for a con siderably long period prior to their emergence in history through their records As a matter of fact, this assumption should hold good with reference to all the other peoples in western Asia which show linguistic and cultural affinity with the ancient Indians and Iranians The essentially Aryan character of the Kassites would be further confirmed by the fact that they are credited with bav jog introduced the use of horse for drawiog chariots into the ancient Near East. The recorded history of the Kassites extends only from 1700 B, C, to 1170 B, C.
Hugo WINCKLER discovered, in 1906-07, at Boghaz Koj, a tablet which records a peace-treaty concluded about 1400 B. C. between the Hittite monarch, Šubbilulumas, and the king of the Mitandis, Mattiuaza. As witnesses to this treaty have voked, in that record, four gods whose names are almost identi cal with the Vedic gods, Indra, Varuna, Mitra, and Nāsatya. Another tablet was discovered at the same place, by FORRER, some time later. It deals with horse-breeding, and contains certain pumerals which are morphologically similar to later Aryan numerals. Moreover, the names of the Mitanni kings are obviously Aryan games. We read, for instance, names like Subandu, Tušratta, Mattiuaza, Artasumara, etc, which unmistak. ably remind us of Subandhu, Tvesaratha, Mathivāja, Rtasmara, etc. On the very face of it, all this would clearly point to the

essentially Aryan character of the Mitanni speech and religion. Further, the affinity of the Mitannis with the Kassites can be affirmed with a fair amount of plausibility. Who were these Mitannis ? Assuming that the gods mentioned on the Boghaz Kõi tablet are specifically Vedic in character and also assuming that the Vedic religion originally developed on the Indian soil before 2000 B, C, JACOBI, who is supported by KONOW, HILLEBRANDT, and WINTERNITZ, suggests that the Mitannis represent the Indian tribes which had migrated from India to the west. An attempt is made to support this hypothesis with two more facts : Firstly, PARGITER finds evidence in ancient ladian traditions of the Vedic tribe of the Drubyus having migrated to the west.55 And, secondly, evidence is produced to prove that, even later, Indian tribes have migrated to Asia Minor and Armenia. But the very starting point of this hypothesis, namely, that the gods of the Boghaz Koi tablet are specifically Vedic in character has been challeaged by several scholars. OLDEN BERG sees in them proto-Iranian gods, and, therefore, connects the Mitannis with early Iran.sTo say that the Mitannis were the Aryans on their way to Iran and India is hard to believe, because the origin of the Rgvedic mantras must be definitely assigned to a period prior to 1400 B. C.
A deeper study of all the available material relatiog to the Mitagnis would help us to understand the entire situation in its proper perspective. The Mitanni language is a sotem language, and is seen to be specifically identical neither with Vedic, because, in Mitandi, ra is changed to orla, nor with ancient Iranian, because Mitanni retains s between vowels. That language, therefore, was presumably akin to the ancestor of both Vedic and ancient Iranian. The religion of the Mitannis, as

indicated by the four gods mentioned on the Boghaz Koi tablet, presents only the basic conceptions of the Vedic and Iranian reli gions, and not their special developments. The Mitanni tribes call themselves Harris, that is, Āryas, and their warrior-class is called Marianna which seems to be equivalent to the Vedic marya. Their pig-tail, their religious symbols of stastika and inverted tri apgles, and their funeral customs clearly betray their IE - or, to be more precise, Aryan - Origin. They borrowed words and ideas from the peoples of western Asia to whom they gave, in return, horse and war-chariot which are objects possessing distin ctly Aryan character. They could have come to their new home on upper Euphrates, not by sea, nor through Asia Minor, Dor via Caucasus, but from the south-western direction. They first settled down in Northera Mesopotamia, and, in course of time, became a strong power in that focality. But, like the Kassites, they were soon submerged into the local population. All these facts would show that, like the Kassites, who were the vanguards of the proto-Aryan migrations, the Mitannis also were immigrants from the proto-Aryan Urheimat in the Balkh region, who must have separated from the main stock of the proto-Aryans in the initial stages of the formation of the Aryan speech and religion. There must have, indeed, been several such minor migrations of the proto-Aryans, as is indicated by the Aryan elements in the records of the Hyksos kings and those discovered at El-Amarna. These more or less successive but stray immigrant tribes of the proto-Aryans, who seem to have migrated, only in small numbers cach time, came to Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, North Meso potamia, and the surrounding region, between 2300 and 2000 and settled there. There they established their powerful princi palities but were gradually absorbed by the indigenous popula tions. And, according to the extent to which they were absorbed, they have retained the Aryan character of their language, religion, and culture, in greater or smaller degree.58

Not much need be said about the relations between the an. cicat Indians and the ancient Iranians. Their mutual affinities in the matter of language, rcligion, and social organisation are too patent to need any specific mention. When the ancestors of the proto-Aryans left the IE Urheimat in the North Kirghiz steppes and set out on their journey towards the region around Baikh, the proto-Aryan speech and religion also may be said to have begun to take shape. The stray and minor migrations of the proto-Aryans from this secondary Urheimat near Ballh carried with them in western Asian regions the basic forms of that speech and religion. But the remaining stock of the proto-Aryans, which must have been of considerable proportions, evolved, out of that basic Aryanism, a new and noble form, which may be appro priately regarded as the common ancestor of the Veda sad the Avesta, both from the linguistic and religious points of view. A considerable portion of the Vedic mantras and the Avestan gāthas, at least in their primary form, was produced by these proto Aryans who were left behind in the Balkh region after the migra tions of the Kassites, the Mitannis, and others. I say primary forms, because I believe that it is necessary to recognise two-dis tinct layers in the evolution of the Rgveda. The Vedic mantras must have been originally composed in a living dialect, which we may call proto-Rgvedic. These mantras were, later on, worked upon by the hymn-makers, who purposely used an archaic-look ing, priestly, artificial dialect, which was presumably not their own vernacular. As EDGERTON has pointed out, these hymn makers were members of a priestly guild, the intellectual leaders

of their community, and very proud of their status. They were carefully trained, and, on the whole, handled their archaizing language quite well.80 But, as was to be expected, they slipped now and then. As in the matter of language, so too in the matter of literary form, we have to recognise two stages ; one of stray, scattered mantras, and the other of organised, systematic hymn making and samhitiharana.
In a sense, the Rgveda may be said to bave been born outside India. For, a considerable portion of the corpus of the Rgvedic mantras took its initial shape in the Balkh region, between 2400 and 2000 B C., though its priestly revision, obscuration, and division and arrangement into family-collections were accomplished later in the land of the seven rivers. The origin and development of the Avesta must have proceeded more or less on the same lines, but in a different locality and under different influences. The ancestors of the Indian Aryans and the Iranian Aryans formed the main stock of the proto Aryaps, after the stray migrations of their cousins, the Kassites and the Harris or the Mitannis,61 The former lived together and developed their language and religion which may be called proto Vedic-Avestan. It was in the Balkh region that they evolved their specific religious ideology centering round the notion of the cos mic law and its administrator (Rra-Varuna) as also the fire-cult and the Soma-cult which latter was facilitated by the abundant growth of the Soma plant on the Mujavat mountain in their neighbourhood. In course of time, however, some tribes separat ed themselves from the proto-Aryan stock, gradually migrated to the North of Iran in a peaceful manner, and later settled down in that country. As was to be expected, they took with them to their new habitat that form of language and religion which they had developed when they had lived together with their Indian brethren, that is to say, the proto-Indo-Iranian language and religion. But, owing to their new environments, which were diffe.

rent from those in wbich the Vedic Indians later lived, the further development of the ancient Iranian language and religion was a little different from that of the Vedic language and religion, The ancient Iranians specially sponsored the Varuņa-religion, which, under the influence of the great religious reformer, Zarathushtrá, assumed, about the beginning of the first millennium B. C., the form of the religion of Ahura Mazdah. The ancestors of the Vedic Indians were more ambitious. They set out from their home in the Balkh-region towards Saptasindhu on what eventually proved to be a march of conquest and colonization. On their way they encountered many physical impediments and consider able human opposition (vľtra and dāsa). In conformity with this new trend in their way of life, they created a new religion - the religion of warlike and heroic Indra. It is, indeed, natural that Vítrabā Purandara Indra, to whose victorious leadership the Vedic Aryans owed their great exploits, should dominate the Rgveda-Samhita.[According to my revised view, it was a few adventurers from among these Indra-worshipping Vedic Aryan tribes pushing forward towards Saptasindhu who retraced their steps, went to Anatolia, and established their kingdoms in that region.
On the basis of the foregoing discussion, I feel justified in visualising the main trends in the early history of the IEs some what as follows: In the earliest period to which we can push back their history, on the strength of linguistic, archaeological, anthro pological, and culture-historical evidence, we find the IEs, who were racially a mixed but linguistically and culturally a more or less homogeneous community, living in the region between the Urals and Altai, to the north-east of the Caspian Sea and to the north of Turkistan, that is to say, broadly speaking, in the North Kirghiz steppes. It is this region which must be regarded as the most suitable locality for the emergence of the ul-IE speech such as we are now able to reconstruct. It is again this region which

EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
can satisfactorily account for the obvious Altaic, Ugro-Fipnic and Semitic influences on the primitive IE speech and culture. This region may, therefore, be reasonably called the primary Urheimat of the IEs. The conditions of vegetation in this locality, where the IE tribes originally berded sheep and cattle on grassy steppes, must have, in course of time, necessitated their migrations out of it, and the movements of their herds on a farge scale. A study of the subsequent course of events would enable us to presume that this JE unity dated from about 4,000 B, C., which is, as a matter of fact, a fairly late date in the history of man on this earth This, then, is the first landmark in the history of the IEs.
The second landmark in their history is represented by the isolated migration of some tribes from among the proto-IEs in an early stage of the development of their language and civilisation. These tribes separated from the main stock of the 1Es in the North Kirghiz steppes, came a little southwards, and entered Asia Minor via the northern coast of the Caspian sea and across the Caucasus. They were the Hittites. The records of these isolated IE immigrants, which date from about 1900 B, C., show no consciousness on their part of having been immigrants. This fact would indicate that they had settled down to the south and in the interior of Asia Minor long before that date. This is furtber confirmed by the fact that these out siders emerge into the history of western Asia as powerful empire builders. This would be properly understandable only on the assumption of their very early settlement in that region. The isolated migration of the Hittites may, therefore, be presumed to have started between 2800 and 2500 B. C. Their separation from the proto-lEs at a very early date and then losg sojoure la ise lation from the main stock must be considered to have been responsible for the fact that their language, though essentially IE in character, has developed some special peculiarities which are not to be seen in other JE languages. Even after this solitary migration, the main body of the IEs continued to live together for some time, which fact can be definitely proved on the strength of linguistic evidence.
ANTECEDENTS OF THE VEDIC PERIOD
41
The third landmark in the early history of the IEs is chara cterised by two major migrations. The earlier major migration was in the south-eastern direction. These tribes, whom we are entitled to call the proto-Aryans, separated from the main body of the IEs (minus, of course, the Hittites ) and moved to a locality which was not very different from their Urheimat, namely, the region around Balkh. This plain of Balkh is the end of a long area of light rain-fall that stretches from the slope of the Hindu Kush mountains westward towards the Caspian sea. Here, between 2600 and 2300 B. C., the proto-Aryan language and religion must have attained characterisation&rsquo;. For our present purpose, namely, the reconstruction of the antecedents and the early beginnings of the Vedic period of Indian history, it may be added that it must have been in this region that the Vedic langu age and religion began to take shape. A major portion of the Vedic mantras, in their primary form, was produced in the region around Balkh; only their revision, priestly obscuration, artificial archaization, and samhitikarana were accomplished in the land of the seven rivers. A critical study of the Rgveda. from ti linguistic and literary points of view, makes it necessary to recognise these two stages in the production and evolution of that Veda. The proto-Aryans must have made their home in the Balkh region for a considerable length of time, so much so that they almost forgot their connections with their primary Vrheimat in the North Kirghiz steppes. The region around Balkh may, therefore, be appropriately called a secondary Urhei mat – that is, the Urheimat of the proto-Aryans.
The second major migration from the primary Urheimat was effected along the northern coast of the Caspian sea, through the dry steppe or salt desert, to the Volga, whence another steppe stretches westwards as far as the Dnieper. These westward migrating tribes, however, seem to have used the Volga-Dnieper valley in South Russia not as a permanent habitat, but only as a passage. They seem to have migrated still farther westwards into the Baltic plain, especially into the Pripet region. Linguistic evidence points to the Pripet region having been another secondary

Urheimat. Just as the Balkh region may be called, in a sense, the Urhemat of the proto-Aryans, the Pripet region may be called the Urheimat of the proto-Europeans, or, to be more precise, of the common ancestors of the speakers of the European members of the IE language-family.
From these secondary Urheimats in the Balkh region and the Pripet region, there were started further migrations, which, in contrast with the major migrations from the primary Urheimat, may be termed secondary migrations. These secondary migra tions represent the fourth and last landmark in the history of the IES For our present purpose, we are concerned mainly with the migrations of the Proto-Aryans from Balkh. We know that, ever since the proto-Aryans migrated to and settled down in the region around Balkh, their speech and religion had beguo to assume a distinctive form. In course of time, some of the tribes from among the proto-Aryans peacefully migrated into Iran and there developed a form of religion which was quite akin to the proto-Aryan religion. The ancestors of the Vedic Indians, on the other hand, ambitiously moved southeastwards, conquering, under the aegis of their newly created pational war-god Indra, the Dásas and the Vrtras whom they encounte red on their way. Eventually, by about 2100-2000 B.C., they advanced as far as Panjab where they came across what was perhaps the last phase of the Harappan civilisation. It may be presumed that Indra, the warlıke leader of the Vedic Aryans who was later transformed into the national war-god, administered the final crushing blow to the already tottering Harappan civilisation, which, incidentally, was a civilisation of fortified settlements, and thus qualified himself for the proud epithet of purandara, the breaker of forts.63

region directly from Balkh, as suggested above. It was rather the * result of an isolated adventure, round about 2100 B, C., of some groups from among the Indra-worshipping proto-Aryans who had already left Balkh on their southeastward march towards Sapta. sindhu. They took advantage of the political upheaval, caused by the Kassites, to push forward and subsequently consolidated their power in North Mesopotamia, Syria, and Palestine. There is evidence to show that the Mitannis overthrew the Hyksos dynasty. In the earlier stages of their adventure, the Mitannis came in contact with their not-distant cousins, the Kassites, while, at a later stage, they had an occasion to encounter and eventually conclude a peace-treaty with the Hittites, who, too, were distantly related to them from the linguistic point of view. Another point to be noted about these adventurers is that, being small in number, when they are actually attested in later history, they appear to have been absorbed by the indigenous peoples of North Mesopotamia, Syria, and Asia Minor, At the same time, they seem to have completely overwhelmed the local population perhaps on account of their superiority in the matter of language and religion, and also as the result of their warlike spirit and adventurous enterprise. But their supremacy did not last long. As a matter of fact, their whole history can be said to have extended over a period of less than 1000 years - from 2100 B, C. to 1200 B.C. Unlike their cousins in Iran and India, they soon disappeared from the scene, together with their language, religion, and culture, never to be revived again.64 ]
This, then, is a brief statement relating to the antecedents and the early beginpiogs of the Vedic period of Iodian history. I realise that it by no means presents a complete picture. Many details still need to be added to it. Nor has it been possible for me to undertake an elaborate and conclusive discussion of the several problems involved in this connection. As a matter of fact, that was not my intention. My intention was oply to indi cate certain lines on which the reconstruction of the history of

In the same strain as of W. D. WHITNEY, who was speaking about India&rsquo;s literary history, it may be said that such hypotheses put forth in the field of ancient Indian history are pins set up to be bowled down again'. It is, however, my belief that, in the interest of historical progress, it is pecessary and desirable that such pias' are set up even though only to be bowled down and replaced by stronger and firme pias.

<p>SOME ASPECTS OF THE INDO-MEDITERRANEAN CONTACTS
The subject of my lecturel is : Some Aspects of the Contacts between India and the Mediterranean World. Let me begin by defining my subject geographically and chronologically. For the purpose of this paper, by &quot; Mediterranean World &quot; I have under stood, on the one hand, the Levant which included Asia Minor and the Fertile Crescent with Egypt at its western terminus, Syria Palestine forming its western band, and Assyria-Babylonia con stituting its eastern bow, and, on the other, Greece and Rome. By India I mean the Indian subcontinent, I shall deal with my subject roughly in four chronological periods, which, for the sake of convenience, I shall designate as Indo-Mesopotamian period, Indo-Anatolian period, Indo-Hellinistic period, and Indo-Roman period.
An important aspect of the proto-historic India is represented by the Indus valley civilization (now more popularly known as the Harappan civilization) which has been brought to light, in its various ramifications, during the course of the last forty years or So. On the basis of an examination of the craniological series of Mohenjodaro, a majority of anthropologists and ethnologists are now inclined to reject the theory that the Mohenjodaro people contained a mixture of such types as the Negroid, the proto. Australoid, the Veddoid, etc., and to suggest that the Indus valley people belonged to the mediterranean branch of the europeoid race. Mario CAPPIERI, for instance, says that in the fourth millennium B. C. and probably before, North-West India seems to have been inhabited by a long-head race, which had a high

vault, long face, and thin and prominent nose,&lsquo;3 Indeed, in different parts of the region which included Anatolia, Palestine, Mesopotamia, Iran, and North-West India, one has to assume the existence of a very archaic racial type of extensive diffusion, relatively homogeneous and living in well defined, small, indepen dent groups This type belongs to tbe great group of mankind, which G SERGI has called the Mediterranean race. Most of the anthropologists, who have examined the human remains found in the excavations of the regions from the Aegean Sea to the Indus and who have minutely studied the prehistoric skulls and skele tons, admit that the long-head forms belong to the Mediterranean stock. The Mediterranean type of people is believed to have been the carliest contributor of agriculture and urban civilization in almost the whole extensive area stretching along the Mediterra nean basis towards the east up to North-West India. It is sug gested that the rise of the Indus cities was due to a kind of cul tural explosion or revolution occasioned by the penetration into India of a new ethnic group, namely, one of the Mesopotamian peoples - presumably the Ubaidians - which was subjugated and forced out by the Sumerians.
However, in view of the fact that the skeletal remains exca vated from the various sites of the indus.civilization are extre mely meagre, it would perhaps be hazardous to assert that the authors of that civilization belonged to the eastern type of the Asiatic proto-Mediterraneans. There is, indeed, no evidence to suggest any wholesale migration of peoples from Mesopotamia to the Indus region. There is also reason to believe that the socio political patterns of the Mesopotamian and the Indus civilizations were quite distinct from each other. It is further to be noted that, besides the Mediterranean type, the Indus skeletal remains were found to include stray brachycephalic Alpine or Armenoid types as well. Therefore, on the basis of the available evidence, it would be safer to assume that the Harappans originated in the local soil, that their civilization was essentially an indigenous develop ment, but that they had very busy and active contacts with, among

INDO-MEDITERRANEAN CONTACTS
47
others, the Mesopotamians belonging to the Mediterranean stock from whom they borrowed some techniques of urban life.
The contacts between the sodus and the Mesopotamian re gions can be traced back to the Sargonide period of the Sumerian history (circa 2500 B, C) and seem to have actively continued up to at least 1900 B. C. A mention may be made in this connec tion of actual finds of objects which were typical of one civiliza tion in the archaeological sites representing the other civilization. Such are, for instance, the distinctive but uras (pyxis) in the proto-historic cities of Mesopotamia and Elam, the bone inlays of the characteristic Iodus kidney-shape, segmented, etched and gold disc beads, bronze amulets of couchant bulls, Early Dynastic scarlet ware with the figure of humped bull, and pottery bearing kaobs. The stylistic and typical details of these objects are such as would render improbable the assumption of coincidental similarities The evidence of the discovery in the Royal Tombs of Sumer of the figure of squatting monkey, carpelian beads, and a peculiar type of hair-dressing as also of the discovery in Harappa of a distinctive type of terracotta figurines, fashioned in the round, depicting nude male body, perhaps ithyphallic, with ex tremely obese stomach, prominent buttocks, shoulder-holes for the attachment of movable arms and stubby tail, hundreds of specimens of which have also been excavated from the Meso potamian sites, is certainly quite illuminating. A terracotta die of Indian origin discovered by Professor SPEISER in his Tepe Gawra excavations again suggests a basic synchronism between the Mesopotamian Old Akkadian period and the &ldquo;mature&rdquo; Harappan period 4 A reference may be made here also to the figurines of the so-called Eye-Goddesses, which have been discovered in the Indus as well as the West Asian archaeological sites. It is rightly pointed out that functional architecture is common to the Indus valley and Sumer. The similarity between the Indus region and Mesopotamia in the matter of corbelled arch (as attested in Tell Asmar and Mohenjodaro), circular wells

EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
of segmental bricks, and stone or baked clay lattice screens for windows cannot be regarded as being fortuitous It may be in cidentally added that the Indus civilization shows some improve ment in certain respects over the technique of Mesopotamia as is testified by the irregular streets of Ur and the planned ones of Mohenjodaro
The evidence of seals is perhaps more convincing As many as thirty ladus seals are said to have been actually excavated from Sumer They can be understood as being indicative of trade contacts between the two regions Such trade link between India and West Asia is confirmed by the discovery of Indus like seals in the island of Bahrain in the Persian Gulf. It has now been shown that the Indus civilization was a marıtıme civilization and not merely a land locked one Lothal which represented a sou thera extension of the Harappan civilization was undoubtedly a port with an impressive dochyard and served as an important centre of sea faring activity between the Harappan and the Meso potamian regions &amp; It is even suggested that the presence of mature Harappan civilization can be attested along the coast as far west as the Dasht valley and that Sutkagen dor in the Dasht valley and Sotka koh in the Shadı kaur valley north of Pasoi played a key role as Harappan ports? It is further suggested that the enterprissog merchants of Kull civilization may have served as middlemen between Mesopotamian and Indus regions A spe cimen of the so called Persian Gulf seal, which, as indicated above, is a variant of the Indus pattern, is discovered at Lothal,

while Briggs BUCHANAN speaks of&rsquo; a dated seal impression con necting Babylonia and ancient India. * Mesopotamian records mention specific goods and materials which used to be imported from foreign lands, and at least some of these must have been imported from the Harappan regions. It is, however, interest ing to note that there are no traces of wares imported by the Harappans Presumably they were &lsquo;soft&rsquo; and &lsquo;consumable&rsquo;, such as garments, wool, leather products, and perfumed oil. In deed, the viability of the Mesopotamian and ladus civilizations depended largely on mutual active trade, and it is not without significance that the end of the international trade of the Larsa period in Mesopotamia coincided with the end of the &lsquo;mature&rsquo; Harappan period.
A reference has already been made to the skeletal remains in the Indus valley which are suggestive of Mesopotamian Mediterranean stock. The Mesopotamian records mention several distant places, some of which may be identified with Indus localities. For instance, the inscriptions of the kings of Akkad and certain lexical texts originating in that region mention Magan or Makkan, which scholars identify with Makran in Baluchistan, and Melubha, from which place carnelian and special kinds of wood were imported by sea by the Babylonians and which is identified with Lothal and its environs.10 Dilmun is frequently mentioned in Sumerian texts and glorified in Sumcrian mythology. It is described as a place where the sun rises (that is, which is towards the east) and as a prosperous land dotted with great dwellings. Samuel KRAMER is inclined to identify

He further points to the signifi. cance of the facts that the great Sumerian water-god Enki was most intimately connected with Dilmun and that the Todus civili zation was characterized by the cult of a water deity and sea faring ships 11 A reference may be made in this context also to words like taimáta, urugulā, and algi viligi occurring in the Atharvai eda (V 13 ), which are obviously non Aryan and which are supposed to have been derived from Mesopotamian Tiamut (the dragon ), urugala (the underworld), and Bilgi (an ancient Assyrian god) Thus, though it is not possible to ascertain at this stage the exact nature and extent of the interdependence between Indus India on the one hand and Mesopotamia which was a part of the Mediterranean world on the other, the fact that active coptacts had developed between the two regions early in the third millennium B. C and had continued for nearly 800 years can be proved beyond doubt
As a matter of fact it does not seem unlikely that the Indus people had established trade links even with the Minoan Crete In this connection, a reference may be made to the correspondence between the Mother Goddess cults of Harappa and Syria Crete Syrio-Cretan type of doves, snakes, and tree worship was prevalent also in Mohenjodaro and Harappa Further, the segmentai variety of faience beads from Harappa resemble not those of Ur but those discovered in Crete
If the evidence for the Indo Mesopotamian contacts is mainly archaeological, that for the Indo Anatolian contacts is essentially linguistic It also needs to be pointed out that the relationship between India and Anatolia was not of the nature of direct and continuing contacts As a matter of fact, neither of the two regions seems to have been at all conscious of this relationship.

south-west of Ankara ) - presumably, the ancient name of the place was Hattuša - by Hugo WINCKLER in 1906 represented a treaty concluded between the Mitannian ruler Mattiwaza (son of Tušratta) and the Hittite king Suppiluliuma, in the fourteenth century B.C. As witnesses to the treaty are involed, among many other gods, four gods whose names are clearly akin to those of the Vedic gods, Mitra, Varuna, Indra, and Nasatya. About twenty years before this discovery, that is, in 1887, there was discovered at El-Amarna in central Egypt a large number of tablets with writings in cuneiform characters. This collection constituted a part of an ancient archive containing the correspon. dence of Pharaoh Amenophis IV (circa 1364-1347 B, C.) and his father Pharaoh Amenophis III (circa 1402–1364 B, C.) with the castern states – particularly with the city-states in Syria Palestine and with Mitanni in castern Anatolia whose rulers were matrimonially related to the Pharaohs. The names of the Mitanni rulers mentioned in this correspondence, such as Arta tama and Artassumara, also show linguistic affinitics with Aryan names. Three years earlier, that is, in 1884, Friedrich DELIT ZSCH had drawn the attention of scholars to the Aryan influence on the language of the Kassites who seem to have had their principality to the south-east of the Mitannian realm, just to the north of the Persian Gulf. For instance, the word for the sun god in that language was Šuniaś, and, both in form and meaning, it corresponded with the Vedic word sürya. Further, in the course of the archaeological expedition of 1906-12 itself, there was brought to light at Bogazkoi a text dealing with the breeding and training of horses, which belonged to the 14th century B. C. and wbose apiborship was attributed to one Xikkuly described as aśšušćani ( which word is obviously related to asia - horse' and sam-&lsquo;to tame) from the land of Mitanni. This text contains some numerals like aika, lira, panza, šalia, etc, which are unmistakably reminiscent of Sanskrit eka, tri, pañca, sapta, etc. These numerals occur as the first members of the compounds formed with - uartanna, which form is clearly connected with Vedic vartani - its i ending having been changed to a-ending as is to be seen in such Vedic compounds with numerals as dasãigula

(from daśa + anguli) and tryañjala (from tri ef anjal). Finally, between 1925 and 1931, there were unearthed important documents from the city of Nuzi which was situated at the south-eastern end of the Mitannian realm. These documents again contained words like babru-nnu (babhru ), parita-nnu (palta), and pinkara-nnu (pingala) to denote the colours of horses.
This Aryan linguistic material gleaned from different sources, which, however, were directly or indirectly connected with the Mitanni state in ancient Anatolia and wbich generally belonged to the second millennium B, C., is classified under three main heads, namely, (a) Dames of four Vedic gods, (b) thirteen appellatives - among them four substantives, three adjectives, five Dumerals, and one verb - seves of which are derived from Kikkuli&rsquo;s work, three from Nuzi, and three from Hurrian records, and (c) a oumber of personal names.13 About the Aryan character of the first two of these classes there can hardly be any doubt, while the third class contains words which seem to be local variations of the original Aryan forms. In the context of this last class, it may be incidentally pointed out that the mutual influence of the Near Eastern speech and the Aryan speech may be discovered in such phenomena as the peculiar development of the Indo-European vocalısm in Aryan, the participles in- ma-of Luwian with a middle or passive meaning corresponding to the formations like Sanskrit ksāma, stima, bhima, dasma, migma, uma, etc,15 and the Aryan words with Hurrian suffix like mutunni and aššuššanı,16 As regards a more precise linguistic characterization

of these Aryan linguistic remains in Anatolia, one may think of three alternatives: they represent either the proto-Aryan stage or the Irano-Aryan stage or the Indo-Aryan stage. A critical and comparative study of all this material, in the details of which it is neither possible nor Decessary to enter here, has led to the conclusion that the language presupposed by the various forms is nearest to the Vedic Sanskrit.
The mention of the four Vedic gods in the Mitanni-Hittite treaty is particularly significant in this connection. It has been shown that these four gods are mentioned together also in the Rgveda (X, 125. 1 ) and the Atharvaveda (III. 4, 4) and that in the Rgveda they are not unoften celebrated as protectors of treaties or contracts.17
How can this superimposition of the Vedic Aryan element on Mitapoi be historically explained ? It would seem that, after the dark period following the fall of Babylon in about 1650 B. C., the Hurrans spread over a major part of Syria and Mesopotamia and established in that region the kingdom of Mitanni. In this adventure of theirs, the Hurrians were led by Aryan warriors, often referred to as mariann (Vedic marya), who, though comparatively few in number, eventually emerged as rulers and noblemen. Five or six generations of Aryad rulers of Mitanni can be attested from the available records. Two facts need to be emphasized at this stage: (1) The names of the Mitapoi prince involved in the treaty recorded on the Bogazkoi tablet and his father - Mattiwaza and Tušratta - are unmistakably Indo-Aryan, 19 (2) Besides the four Indo-Aryan gods, quite a large number of other gods, presumably Hurrian, are mentioned on the Bogazkoi tablet. It would, therefore, not be wrong to suppose that the Indo-Aryan gods belonged to the Indo-Aryan ruling family and noblemen, while the other gods belonged to the large Hurrian population. It is rightly suggested by HERZFELD that it could have

I visualise the entire course of history in this connection roughly as follows 20 The earliest common habitat of the speakers of proto IE (who, however, did not necessarily belong to the same racial stock), which can be attested on the strength of the available linguistic, archaeological, anthropological, and culture historical evidence, is the North Kirghiz steppes between the Urals and Altai In view of the facts that the proto-Hellenes can be shown to have catered Greece in about 2200 BC, that the Hittites, as will be soon pointed out, started on their isolated migration in about 2800 BC, and that the proto-Aryans must be assumed to have separated from the main stock in about 2600 BC. the proto IE unity can be. with reasonable certainty, dated from 3500 B C It has now been shown that the Hittite language is the oldest offshoot of the proto IE family It shows considerable alipity with proto IE but it cannot be assigned to any specific IE branch We may, therefore, assume th. there occurred an isolated migration of the Hittites from the common proto-lE habitat even before the JE speech bad assumed its specific form The Hittites proceeded towards the south west and occupied the region between the Caucasus mountain and the Caspian sea This may have happened about 2800 B C After a few centuries of comparative able vion, the Hittites are known to have pushed forth further towards the south-west through the Cilician gates and to have established their sovereignty over the highlands in the great bend of the Halys river in the course of their further expansion, they scem, on the one hand, to have reached the Mediterranean sea towards the south west, and, on the other, to have established some kind of suzerainty over the Mitannian kingdom towards the

south-cast. So far as the former event is concerned, it has been pointed out that the contact with the sea had great significance for the laod-locked people like the Hittites, and the sea (aruna in Hittitel ) was, therefore, much glorified in their texts. As for the latter event, it has been pointed out that, in spite of the fairly long period of proximity of the Hittites and the Hurrians, there do not seem to have occurred any significant political-cultural contacts between them until the middle of thc 14th century B. C., when, through a treaty recorded on the Bogazhoi clay tablet, a political and matrimonial alliance came to be established between king Mattiwaza of Mitanni and his suzerain king Suppiluliuma of the Hittites.
But we have anticipated a little. Let us go back to the migrations of the proto-IE-speaking peoples. Even after the isolated migration of the Hittites in the initial stage of the development of proto-IE, the remaining proto-IE-speakers, who may now be designated as JE-speakers, continued to live in the North Kirghiz region for some time. The next landmark in the history of these people is represented by two major migra tions. The earlier major migration was in the south-eastera direction. Some of the tribes of the IE-speakers separated from the main body of the IE-speakers and migrated to a locality not very different from their Urheimat, namely, to the region round about Balkh. The other major migration was towards the Pripet region from where there later occurred further secondary migra tions towards, among others, the Aegean world, Italy, and Germa nic lands. We are, however, concerned here more with the tribes which migrated to and eventually settled down in the Balkh region. Here, between 2500 B, C. and 2300 B, C.. the proto Aryan language, which, on the one hand, had evolved out of IE and, on the other, was the ancestor of ancient Iranian and Vedic Sanskrit, as also the proto-Aryan religious ideology, which represented the anterior stage of the Avestan and the Vedic religious ideology, attained characterization.

EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
As from the Pripet region, so too from Balkh there occurred, in course of time, secondary migrations - first of the proto-Indo Aryans towards the land of seven rivers in the south-east and, presumably much later, of the proto-Irano-Aryans towards Iran in the rest. There is reason to believe that, while the proto-Indo Aryans were fighting out their way towards India, their language and religious ideology gradually developed the specifically Vedic character. It was also during the course of this their onward march, under the leadership of Vitrahā Indra, that some adven turists from among them, instead of proceeding towards Sapta sindhu with their comrades, turned back and wended their perilous and protracted way towards the north-west. It was the descendants, by several generations, of these yaliant proto-Indo Aryaa defectors who ultimately reached the central bend of the Fertile Crescent, iasinuated themselves among the local Hurrians as their leaders, and eventually established the Mitaoni Kingdom under their sovereignty.3: The Mitannian kings were ncither the ancestors of the Indo-Aryans, nor were they, strictly speaking, the Indo-Aryans who had migrated from India to East Anatolia. Their ancestors had, however, been closely related to the ancestors of the Indo-Aryans as members of one and the same linguistic and religious fraternity. But they had separated themselves from the latter even before thc latter had entered fadia and had thus become proper Indo-Aryans. One branch of the proto-Indo Aryans entered Saptasindhu by the end of the third millennium B. C. and soon succceded in firmly laying the foundation of Vedic religion and culture. The other branch of the proto-Indo Aryans made its appearance, a few gcacrations later, in Asia Minor&rdquo; as the group of condoticeri who cstablished the kingdom of Mitanni by the middle of the sccond century B. C. The lates of these two branches of the prolo-Indo-Aryan community proved to be quite distinct from cach other. The proto-Indo-Aryans migrating into North-Western India ucrc comparatively few in

number, but they seem to have possessed tremendous power to diffuse their language and culture so that, instead of being absorbed by the indigenous population, they could superimpose their own language and culture on that population. The Vedic language and culture soon became deeply and permanently rooted in the Indian soil. As against this, the proto-Indo-Aryans, who had made a detour in the direction of the Near East and who must have lost many of the features of their proto-lodo Aryan language and religious ideology already in the long process of that detour, could influence the indigenous Hurrian population of that region, through their language and religion, only super ficially and that too because they had manoeuvered to establish themselves as a ruling class withia that population. Unlike their brethren in India, they disappeared from the scene of history, politically and culturally, within less than 200 years. It is only on the hypothesis as stated above that the stray Indo-Aryan elements in the Mitannian and allied records of about the middle of the second millennium B. C. can be adequately accounted for.
An important aspect of the Indo-Mediterranean contacts was represented by the contacts between the Phoenicians and the Indians. But very little archaeological, linguistic, or historical evidence is available for it being possible to make any adequate statement about those contacts. A suggestion is often made that the Panis mentioned in the Rgreda must have been Phocpician merchants. The Panis are no doubt described in the Rgveda as rich traders and usurers, but the Rgveda also gives the impression that the Panis were not mere casual traders. They seem to have become more or less permanently settled in India, and the Vedic Aryans, in the course of their colonization, continually encountered them and that too in a hostile manner. This would certainly go against their identification with the Phoenicians. The Panis seem to have been connected, in a special way, with Divodása, the river Sarasvati, and the family of the Bharadvājas. Then there is the legend that Saramā discovered the place where the Panis had kept the kine of the Vedic Aryans in captivity. All this does not conform with the general character of the Phoeni.

cians as known from their history The Phoenicians were famous throughout antiquity for their maritime prowess which feature is hardly ever attributed to the Panis in the Rgveda 24 It was only after the end of the old Babylonian civilization that the region of Syria Palestine began to assume importance, and it was only as the result of the conflict between Egypt on the one hand and the Hittite Mitanni kingdoms on the other that the Phocnicians who had established themselves between Lebanon to the north and Palestine to the south enjoyed a period of inde pendence The earliest evidence of trade contacts between Phoenicia and Western India goes back only to 975 BC In that year, Hiram, king of Tyre, sent his fleet of ships of Tarsbish' from Egion Geber, at tbe head of the Gulf of Akaba in the Red Sea to fetch &lsquo;ivory, apes, and peacocks from the port of Ophir (which is identified with Sopara) to decorate the palaces and the Temple of King Solomop 25 But this commerce in merchandise between India and Phoenicia does not seem to have been accompanied by commerce in other aspects of culture and cryilization
This however, happened in a distinctive manner - but, perhaps, in the reverse order - 11 the case of the contacts between the Greeks and the Indians It may be pointed out, at the outset, that as members of the collateral branches of the IE linguistic family, the Indians and the Greeks were, in a sense closely related to each other When however, they met again many centuries later, they did it as complete strangers In the 6th century BC Persia served as a link between the Greeks and the Indians Indian troops are known to have served under the Persians when they invaded the Greek possessions, while Greek officials and mercenaries are known to have served in the Persian administra tive set up even in India When, for instance, Darius had

advanced as far as the head-waters of the Indus in 510 B. C., he is reported to have sent a Greek mercenary, named Skylax, to sail down the Indus and make his way home via the Red Sea. Skylax took the old route followed by the Phoenician traders and arrived at Arsinoe (which is identified with modern Suez) after a voyage of two and a half years.26 For whatever he tells us about India, Herodotus (born in 484 B. C.) has apparently depended largely on the account of Skylax. Panini (6th-5th centuries B, C.) shows acquaintance with the Yavanas or the Ionian Greeks. In this connection it may be pointed out that the true classical Hellenic thought and culture origtoated and developed in lonia in West Anatolia rather than on the mainland of Greece. It is, indeed, surprising that, even after having come into sufficiently close contact with the lonian Greeks, the Indians, who were generally endowed with a sharp linguistic sense, had not noticed the similarities betwecn their own language and the language of the Yayanas. Ctesias, another Greek, who lived at the Persian court at Susa for a fairly long time, has also written about India, but his account has tended to be more romantic than realistic.
It seems that, before the times of Alexander the Great, thought travelled from the east towards the west. Thales (6th century B, C.), who is called the Father of Greek philosophy and who belonged to Miletus in Ionia, postulated a physical-natura listic principle, namely, water, as the one basic substance from which all else in the universe was composed. The Eleatic School aimed at discovering the ope reality underlying the material phenomena, and the Orphic movement emphasized that the soul, which was immortal and which was distinct from the body, sought release from the body. According to Heraclitus (540-475 B. C.), life was change and the entire universe was ever in flux, while Democritus (460-370 B, C.) believed that the reality was the mechanical motion of atoms. No direct evidence is available which might belp us to ascertain whether the Indian philosophica

thought bad exercised any significant influence on these and similar Greek speculations. But the facts such as that these and allied philosophical doctrines had already been known in India, that many of these doctrines had originated among the Tonian Greeks (or the Yavadas) who had close contacts with Persia and through Persia with India, that, according to his biographer Iamblichus, Pythagoras (born in 580 B. C.) had studied the esoteric teachings of, among others, the Brāhmaṇas, and that there is the traditional account of the meeting in Athens between Socrates and some learned Brāhmanas, point to the high probability of the influence of Indian thought on Greek philo sophical speculatioss.
Alexander&rsquo;s momentous campaigns in the East brought the Greeks in closer and more direct contact with the Indians than heretofore. Alexander, educated under the tutorship of Aristotle, set out on his victorious march in 334 B. C. and conquered ja quick succession Asia Minor, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt where he founded the city of Alexandria, Then he turned eastward, marched over the Fertile Crescent and defeated the large Persian
forces of Darius III in the battle of Arbela in 331 B. C. Five years later he reached Panjab. Alexander was not only a conqueros, he was also an explorer. During his military exped! tions he was always accompanied by trained historians, scientists, and philosophers. Indeed, he was the pioneer of the Hellenistic (as against Hellenic) movement, which had for its aim the &lsquo;extension of Hellenic culture among the non-Greeks. His dream &lsquo;of bringing about the marriage of Europe and Asia&rsquo; did not materialise, but, in the course of his attempts in that direction, the centre of gravity of Greek culture came to be shifted from Greece to Asia. Alexandria developed into the biggest city of the realm-a great cosmopolitan centre of academic and commer cial activities. Alexander&rsquo;s conquests gave rise to a new move ment of colonial expansion in the East, which implied the establishment of a number of new cities and kingdoms with Greek rulers and Greek advisers and the diffusion of Greek culture. It must, however, be noted that the vast mass of the

61
people, on whom the Greek rule had been clamped, did not become hellenized.
Alexander&rsquo;s Indian conquests proved almost ephemeral, so much so that they have been rarely mentioned in contemporary literature. But their general impact was vomistakable. For one thing, it is not unlikely that Kautilya&rsquo;s exaltation of the king&rsquo;s absolute authority and his emphasis on the vast bureaucratic governmental machinery with centralised control, which did not fit in well into the pattern of India&rsquo;s traditional polity, were the result of the influence which the Hellenistic model in that regard must have exercised on that sagacious political teacher and administrator. It was again through Greek (and Persian) contacts with India in the 5th-4th centuries B. C. that iron is said to have been brought to India 27 Those contacts also resulted in a kind of second urbanisation,&lsquo;28 and cities like Charsada and Taxila came to be built. It is suggested that the builders of megaliths in South India were a people of Mediterra nean stock who probably came to the West coast by sea, entered South India in about 500 B, C, and then spread northwards.to Trade between India and the Hellenistic world received great impetus. There were several trade-routes, the two more common having been: (1) overland ; Pāçalıputra-Taxıla-Bactra (the capital of Bactria ) - tben west by south across the long stretches of the Persian and the Median territory to Seleucia - and from there either up the Euphrates reaching Antioch, or via Edessa to the Mediterranean; and (2) by sea : From India&rsquo;s west coast - to ports of the Persian Gulf – then up the Tigris to Seleucia - and then onwards by either of the two routes mentioned above.

After the death of Alexander at Babylon in 323 B, C, his vast empire broke up into four parts - the Ptolemaic empire in Egypt, the Seleucid empire in Syria and Persia, Antigonus&rsquo; empire in Macedonia and Greece, and the Oriental Greek and Bactrian kingdoms to the north-west of India Seleucos Nekator of the Syrian Persian Greek empire, who tried to emulate Alexander by invading Pataliputra, was defeated by Candragupla Maurya (322-298 B C ), and a matrimonial alliance is reported to have been concluded between the two. Seleucos also appoin ted Megasthenes as his ambassador in the court of Pataliputra The cultural contacts between the Maurya and the Seleucid realms continued even after Candragupta&rsquo;s death, and the amusing episode 18 narrated that Bindusara, Candragupta&rsquo;s successor, wrote to his contemporary Antiochus I of Syria asking for a sample of Greek wine and some raisins and a sophist who would teach him how to argue, and that Antiochus, while sending the wine and raisins with great pleasure, informed him that it was not good form among the Greeks to trade in philosophers. After Asoka (273-232 B, C.) became converted to the religion of the Buddha, he, as mentioned in his thirteenth rock-edict, dispatched missionaries to Antiochus and four other Greek kings, namely, Ptolemy Philadelphus of Egypt, Antigonus Gopatas of Macedonia, Magas of Cyrene, and Alexander of Epirus,30 with a view to winning them over to the Law of Piety and World Peace. It is also noteworthy that a special board in charge of foreigners in Jodia had been set up in the Maurya administrative system.si

other. Rome entered into Hellenistic affairs in 212 B, C., but the acme of the Graeco-Roman civilization, which was characte rized by the assimilation of the Hellenic elements and the preservation of Hellenistic culture in the East, was reached during Pax Romapa (that is from Augustus (30 B, C) to Marcus Aurelius [ 170 A. D. ]).
During this period, the Gāndhāra region had become the main centre where the Indian culture and the Graeco-Roman culture encountered each other and often fused together. Trade was perhaps the most essential link of this cultural contact. Indeed, the Kusāna prosperity seems to have depended largely on foreign trade. It is not unlikely that the advent of the Kusānas in Shen-to (that is, the lower Indus region) was primarily motivated by the prospects of rich gains from its thriving Indo Roman commerce. 82 During the Kusāna rule, the Graeco Roman trade with the East was at its height. A sea-captain from Alexandria who had then visited India has reported that spices and silks left Indian ports to be exchanged for Roman gold coins, Greek wines, and choice girls for the royal harems. The Milindpanha ( Ist century A. D.) also contains references to brisk maritime trade between India and Alexandria, The two great cities of Gāndhāra, namely, Begram and Taxila, had developed into veritable trade-centres on the Balkh-Gandhāra route. There bave been found at Begram ruins of a &lsquo;palace (assignable to the 2nd-3rd centuries A D.), two rooms of which have yielded a hoard of Mediterranean and oriental wares, such as glass vessels from Syria and Egypt, Indian ivories, bronze bowls from Western factories, steelyard-weights in the form of busts of Minerva and Mars, and a good deal of specimens of Roman art like figures of Harpocrates, Hercules, and the grotesque philosopher&rsquo; of the Alexandrian type. According to Mortimer WHEELER, this must have been a customs depot.

Evidence is available to show that equally active and rich trade was carried on between the Tamil region in South India and the Roman empire, in the early centuries A. D. As a matter of fact, even before the Romans had come on the scene, the Tamil country was engaged in prosperous trade and commerce with Egypt and the Greek kingdoms. In this connection it is note worthy that the Hebrew word for peacock and the Greek words for ginger, cinnamon, and rice have been derived from Tamil. The Periplus of the Er; threan Sea by an Alexandrian sea-farer, of about the time of Nero, describes the journey from the Red Sea along the Indian coast from the mouth of the Indus to that of the Gangā But the most frequently followed trade-route seems to have been : Alexandria-Aden-Indian Ocean-Muziris ( Cran. ganore ) in Malbar. The discovery of the Monsoon in about 50 A. D must have given added fillip to the sea-journey from the Gulf of Aden to India between May and October and the return journey between November and March. According to Pliny, who complained of the drain of Eastern luxuries upon Rome, Rome used to pay fifty million sesterces annually for balance of trade with India The large hordes of Roman coins found in South India would also bear ample testimony to the magnitude of trade between India and the Roman world. The exports from India consisted mainly of pepper, cinnamon, spices, drugs, pearls, silks, and muslins, while among the merchandise imported into Jadia were precious metals, pottery, glassware, wine, silverware, and human cargo (constituted of craftsmen and masons). It is certainly not without significance that several specimens of Roman glass have been discovered in the excavations at Dharoikota (Dhanakataka ) in Andhra.4 Attention may further be drawn to the fact that Tamil authors have referred in their writings to Roman colonies in South India at places like Muziris, Madura, and Pukar - the colonists having mainly been the natives of Syria and Egypt with Roman officers in charge. Incidentally, it may also be mentioned that, in the course of excavations at Pompeii in 1939, there has been discovered a fine ivory statuette

of Indian workmanship supposedly portraying the Hindu goddess Laksmi. Some merchant must have brought it bome after his Indian adventure, before 79 A. D. when Pompeii was over whelmed. 35
So far as political relations are concerned it may be men tioned that the Kuşāpa king Kadphises III had sent an embassy to Rome in 99 A, D. to congratulate Trajan on his accession. Actually, more than a century earlier, a Pandya embassy, under the leadership of Zarmannchegas (Śramanācārya), had left Bhțgukaccha in 25 B, C, and waited upon Augustus at Samos in 21 B. C. with presents for the Emperor which are said to have consisted, among other things, of gigantic python, huge tortoises, and an armless boy who could shoot arrows with his feet. Indeed, at least nine ambassadors from India are known to have visited Roman emperors up to the times of Constantine, The purpose of these embassies must have been both diplomatic and commercial
Indian philosophy seems to have made a tremendous impres sion upon the thinkers of the Graeco-Roman world. We are told that Appollonius of Tyana ( 50 A. D.) had gone to Taxila to study under the Brāhmana teachers there, while the gaostic Baroksanes had learnt many curious facts about India from the Iodian embassy in Syria (218-222 A. D.) Indeed, gnosticism came to be described as orientalism in a Hellenic garb'. Clement of Alexandria (150-218 A. D.), who, incidentally, was the first Greek writer to mention the Buddha by pame, even went to the extent of asserting that the Greeks had stolen their philo sophy from the barbarians (by which term he must have meant the Indians As if to counterbalance this, the Indian astronomes Varāhamihira admonished his readers, a couple of centuries later, that the science of astronomy was well-established among the Yavanas and that, therefore, though they were barbarians, they must be respected like India&rsquo;s own ancient sages. It is, therefore,

not surprising that two of the five principal schools of Indian astronomy came to be named Romaka (after Rome) and Pauliša (after Paul of Alexandria, 378 A. D.). The assumption of some kind of Hellenistic influence on the growth of Sanskrit drama during the Kusāna period would not be altogether unwarranted. Similarly the type of coinage introduced by the Indo-Bactrian kings was essentially Hellenistic in character. For one thing, those coins either had the names and portraits of the rulers inscribed on them or they showed figures of divinities belonging to the Greek pantheon. Secondly, the names given to some of those cojas, such as Dīpāra and Dramma, are obviously Indian forms of Greek Dinarius and Drachma. The standardızation of this coinage in respect of form and weight was also something which had been unknown in India in the earlier periods.97
But perhaps the most enduring monument of the Indo Hellenistic cultural fusion is to be seen in the Gāndhāra art, which is also significantly called the Graeco-Buddhist art. This school of art was actually inaugurated only after the direct Greek domination in the North-Western region of India had ended, and was patronised mainly by the Sakas and the Kusānas who had continued the tradition of their Hellenistic predecessors. The themes of the Gāndhāra art are essentially Buddhistic, while the style of execution is undeniably Hellenistic. The Gāndhāra Buddha, for instance, looks like an Apollo wearing costumes whose &lsquo;wet&rsquo; drapery is derived from the Classical art. Indian sages and priests are clearly reminiscent of bearded philosophers and sages of the Hellenistic world, and the Yaksas, the Garudas, the Nāgas, and other semi-mythical beings appear to be mere eastern versions of the genit of the Hellenistic pantheon. The influence of the Hellenistic art-forms is unmistakably reflected in

physiognomy, drapery, the wavy treatment of the hair, the use of Corinthian colonette as a space-divider in relief compositions, etc., adopted by the Gāndhāra artists.3: Verily, the religious penchant of Indian culture, united with the aesthetic penchant of Greek culture, has produced this sublime and creative school of art.

<p>THE CULTURAL BACKGROUND OF THE VEDA
It is generally believed - and, to a large extent, rightly believed that a proper understanding of the Veda affords the master-key which can uprave many a problem relating to ancient Indian culture and civilization. Every serious student of ancient Indian civilization, therefore, begins, naturally enough, by asking himself the question: What is the Veda? Let me also then, by way of a general introduction to my lectures, today begin by posing such broad questions as : What exactly is connoted by the term, Veda? What is its real nature? What is its extent and what its cultural background?
When we speak, in more or less general terms, of Sanskrit language and of Sanskrit literature, we are actually speaking of two languages and of two literatures. In other words, there are, strictly speaking, two Sanskrit languages, the Vedic Sanskrit and the Classical Sanskrit, the one being distinct from the other in respect of several essential linguistic characteristics. Corres pondingly, there are two Sanskrit literatures, the Vedic literature and the classical Sanskrit literature, the one being distinct from the other in respect of nature, extent, and cultural background. I shall try briefly to elaborate this point. In what way is the Vedic language distinct from the classical Sanskrit? It is well known that the science of comparative philology has established the position of Sanskrit as a very important member of the family of Indo-European languages. It is, however, not so very well known that by &ldquo;Sanskrit' is here meant principally the Vedic language and not so much the classical Sanskrit. The implica tions, from the linguistic point of view, of what I have just now said are indeed manifold. Without, however, going into the details of this question, I shall only emphasize what is pertinent to our present purpose, namely that, so far as the study of Indo</p>

European linguistics is concerned, the Vedic language has all along been distinguished from the classical Sanskrit. The second point of distinction, to which I shall now refer, is perhaps more tangible. I shall put it like this: The classical Sanskrit, as we know it, is essentially a static language. It is completely tied down by the rules of grammar - the grammar of Pānini and, to a certain extent, of his immediate successors. Accordingly, there is in that language absolutely no scope for dialectical develop ments and no possibility of dialectical differences. For instance, the Sanskrit, as spoken and written in Kashmir, bas been quite the same as the Sanskrit as spoken and written in the southern most parts of India. Similarly the Sanskrit, as it was spoken and written in the days of Kālıdāsa or Samkarācārya, was not in any way different from the Sanskrit as it is today spoken and written by a Pandit of Banaras. To resort to a mathematical metaphor, Sanskrit has remained an invariable in the time-space-context, As against this, the Vedic language had been growing and changing throughout its career. It had, indeed, been a &lsquo;living&rsquo; entity. The Vedic language as represented in the Rgvedic mantras, for instance, shows certain linguistic peculiarities which are absent in the Vedic language as represented in the Satapatha brālmana. Again, the occurrence, in the Vedic language, of what are technically called &lsquo;prakritisms would justify our positing the existence of several Vedic dialects. Such a language, with its proneness to change and growth, could not have failed to evoke significant psychological reactions from the speakers of that language.
Another distinctive feature of the Vedic language, as against the classical Sanskrit, is the important role played in it by accent or siara. Apart from ensuring the rhythmic, musical character of the Vedic language, accent also governs the sense of a Vedic word. A story is told in the Vedic literature of how an incorrectly accented word yielded a sense redically different from the one which was intended by the speaker and thus brought disaster on him, when he was, naturally, most unprepared for it. Tvastr had a three-headed, six-eyed son; he was called Visvarūpa. Indra

hated Visvarupa and cut off those heads of his Tvastf was furious and exclaimed, “Has he indeed slain my son?&rsquo; He thereupon performed a Soma sacrifice excluding Indra from a share in the Soma But Indra disturbed Tvasti&rsquo;s sacrifice and forcibly drank the Soma The remains of the Soma Tyaşlı offered upon the Ahavaniya fire, saying, &ldquo;Hail, wax great Indrašatru ” The moment the Soma reached the fire, it developed into human shape as Tvasts&rsquo;s son And, since it so developed whilst rolling onwards ( vrt ), the person born from it came to bi called Vstra But because Tvastsaid, &ldquo;Grow thou, Indrašatru' accenting indra, the first member of the compound indrasatru Indra slew Vrtra. Had Tvasti said. “Grow thou, Indrašatru', accepting satru, the second member of the compound indrašatru Výtra would certainly have forthwith slain Indra The word, indra fatru, is a compound, and can be interpreted either as a genetive tatpurusa compound, that is to say, as indrasja sarruh, mean ing one who is the slayer of Indra, or as a bahusrihi compound, that is to say, as indrah satruh jasya, meaning one whose slayer is Indra Tvasts, of course, wanted his son to be indrašatru in the tatpurusa sense - he wanted him to be the slayer of Indra Now, according to the rules governing the accent of Vedic compounds in a tatpurusa compound, the second member of the compound is accented, while in the bahuvrihi, the first member is accented As it happened, in his great excitement, Tvastr pronounced the word, indraśatru, in the formula, indrašatrur varuhasia, with an accent on the first member and thus made that word yield the bahuvrihi sense The sacrifice performed by Tyastr was otherwise perfect As the result of it Tvastę did obtain a son, namely, Vitra, who did indeed become indrasatru - but in the bahuvrihi sense, and not in the tatpurusa sense as Tvastr had desired Accordingly, Vstra, instead of becoming the slayer of Indra, became one whose slayer was Indra I have recounted this interesting story in order to underline the important role of accent in the Vedic language and the scrupulous care which

people were expected to take in respect of it. In the classical Sanskrit, on the other hand, accept hardly plays any significant role. It will now become clear, from what I have said so far, why, from the linguistic point of view, the Vedic language has to be regarded as distinct from the classical Sanskrit.
far more striking, however, than the points mentioned above in connection with the two languages, are the points which distinguish the Vedic literature from the classical Sanskrit litera ture. The most distinctive claim made on behalf of the Veda is that it is apauruşeya. Let us, for the time being, stick to the traditional view in this regard. According to that view, no human agency has been responsible for the creation of the Veda. The Veda is not man-made; it is god-given. There are, no doubt, frequent references in the Vedic literature itself to several rșis who are said to have been respoasible for the various Vedic mantras. But we have to understand this their responsibility in a limited sense. In order to make this point clear, the Vedic rșis may well be compared to Columbus, Columbus did not create America; he only discovered that land. Similarly, the Vedic rsis did not create or compose the Vedic mantras; they only saw' or dis covered the mantras which had been in existence from times immemorial. Arşi, indeed, is one who sees': rşır darśanai. What the rsis were able to see through their intuitive &lsquo;vision&rsquo; is the Veda - the word, veda, being linguistically connected with Lat. video (=to see ). That is, really speaking, why the Veda is also called darsana - that is to say, the object of immediate vision and not of mediate knowledge.
There is another imagery employed to bring out this character of apauruseyaiva. The Veda is not infrequentiy called the sruri that is, what is heard'. The music of the infinite, which is the Veda, had been going on since eternity. The ancient sages heard it and transmitted it to posterity as their richest heritage. The Veda is sruri in the sense that it is the rhythm of the infinite heard by the soul.3 Obviously no such claim can be made on behalf of the classical Sanskrit literature,</li>
<li>RADHAKRISHNAN, Indian Philosophy I, p. 128.
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
This traditionally accepted apauruşeyatva of the Veda led to some very important consequences It was argued that, being apauruseya, the Veda represents the most complete and the most perfect expression of truth For, it is only what is created by man, which is most likely to be characterised, in one way or another, by defects and imperfection. The apauruseya Veda, which is naturally free from such defects and imperfections, must then be regarded as the most infallible authority in every walk of life The apaurusejatia of the Veda thus logically led to veda pramanya, that is, to the concept of the unimpeachable validity of the Veda. Indian logic usually speaks of three main pramānas or means of knowledge - pratyaksa or direct perception, anumāna or inference, and sabda or the Vedic authority of these three the first two, namely, pratyaksa and anumana, are likely to be vitiated by the natural deficiencies and imperfections of human sense organs and intellect Accordingly, their vilidity is only relative, The third pramāna, namely, Sabda or the Veda, on the other hand, being apauruseya, is free from such deficiencies and imperfections and must, therefore, command absolute validity. Such faith in the absolute validity of the Veda is, indeed, one of the main planks of the Brahmanic ideoloagy Verily it is this criterion which demarcates the two main currents of thought &ndash; the astıka and the nastika - which have flown side by side throughout the cultural history of ancient India The ăstikas (usually called the orthodox) are not, as popularly understood, the theists - those who believe in the existence of god : they are those who have perfect faith in the absolute validity of the Veda, while the năstikas (the hetero dox) are those who challenge this claim of absolute validity made on behalf of the Veda, 34
THE CULTURAL BACKGROUND OF THE VEDA
73
Another distinctive claim pade on behalf of the Veda - a claim, which, in a sense, originates from its apaurnseyatva - is that the Veda is the fountain-head of all knowledge. Religion and philosophy, law and history (itiläsapurana ), fine arts and natural and technical sciences - the beginnings of all these branches of knowledge are traditionally traced back to Vedic sources. This fact would not surprise us if we took into account the vastness of the extent of the Veda. Setting aside the traditional view regard ing the apauruşeyatra and looking at things from a strictly histo rical point of view, one would easily realise that the Veda could not have been produced by one author - not even by one genera tion of authors; it must have been the outcome of the intellectual labours of generations of authors through centuries. What is true in the context of time and authorship is also true in the context of space. It is not possible to assign the produc tion of the Veda to any restricted geographical locality. In deed, without being guilty of exaggeration, one may say that the activity which gave rise to the Veda did, in a sense, extend from the Oxus to the Gangā.* All this vastaess of extent, from the point of view of chronology, authorship, and geographical locality, naturally resulted in the manifold character of the form and the contents of the Veda. Though, therefore, the Veda is popularly regarded as the sacred scripture of Hinduism, ia the sense in which the Koran is regarded as the sacred scripture of Islam and the Bible of Christianity, we have necessarily to distin guish the Veda from the other two works. It is well and truly

said that the Veda is not one single book, it is verily a whole library and literature
And this brings us to perhaps the most characteristic feature of the Veda - a feature, which clearly distinguishes it from the classical Sanskrit literature In spite of its great complexity and diversity in the matter of form and contents the Veda, as a whole is actually found to be characterised by a remarkable unity As will be shown in the sequel, this unity is a kind of logical unity- that is to say, a unity brought about by the logical development of thought from one period of Vedic history to another Of perhaps no other ancient literature than the Veda can it be said that it so faithfully reflects and is so deeply influ enced by contemporary life Throughout the cultural history of the Vedic age Vedic literature and Vedic life have vitally acted and reacted on each other The thread of historical development which runs through Vedic life also binds together in a unified whole the various literary works which are collectively called the Veda Consequently, the importance of the Veda as a valid source of ancient Indian cultural history is far far greater than that of the classical Sanskrit literature
A reference may be made in passing to two other peculiari ties of the Vedic literature The first is that the major portion of the literature which is known as the Veda has been handed down, from generation to generation, through oral tradition The Veda was not written and read it was recited and heard This is another reason why the Veda is known as Srut: The fact that such an extensive literature has been preserved intact through the ages without having been reduced to writing must indeed, be regarded as one of the marvels in the literary history of the world It may, however, be added that perhaps it was the oral tradition itself which helped the Vedic texts having been prescrved perfectly intact For, as the students of textual criticism know, it is in the written out texts that corruptions omissions and interpolations creep in and, in course of time, become rampantAnd how wonderful are the devices which bedTHE CULTURAL BACKGROUND OF THE VEDA

been developed since fairly early times to facilitate the memoris ing and the perfect preservation of the Vedic texts! A single mantra from the Rgveda, for instance, was studied in five principal modes of recitation. Various kinds of permutations and combi pations of the words in a mantra were ingeniously thought out and marshalled into service. There is the normal mode of recita tion, governed by the rules of metre and rhytbm, which is called the sanhita patha. Then there are the pada-pãtha, where each word in a mantra is pronounced separately without coalescence or samdhi and with its own specific accent; the krama-pāíha, where the words are recited in the order : ab, bc, cd, de&hellip;, the jasa pātha (ab, ba, ab; bc, cb, bc; &hellip;); and the ghana-pātha (ab, ba, abc, cba, abc; bc, cb, bod, dcb, bed..). And all such compli cated labours did yield marvellous results. For, to take an exam ple, the entire Rgreda, which consists of 1,028 hymas (about 10,560 mantras or about 74,000 words), bas, through over three millenia, remained perfectly free from veriae lectiones - except in one passage (= VII. 44. 3), where the reading is either bradhnam mamścator varunasya babhrum or bradhnam māścator&hellip;.
But there is also another side to this peculiarity, namely, the oral transmission of the Veda. It is more than probable that, owing to the fact that the Veda had not been reduced to writing, a considerable amount of literature produced by the Vedic poet priests was lost in course of time. Again, there are clear indica tions that there did exist, in those early days, certain literary traditions wbich had not been given a fixed literary form, which, in other words, continued to remain in a fluid and floating condition, and a major portion of which must have, accordingly, become lost to us. In other words, the Vedic literature, which is available to us today, does not represent the entire literary output of the Vedic age. I am often tempted to compare the literature of the Vedic age - indeed, the entire Sanskrit literature - with an iceberg. Just</li>

as a major portion of the iceberg is submerged under waters, only a small portion of it being visible to us, even so, perhaps a major part of the literature of the Vedic age is buried in the abyss of time and only a small part of it has become known to us. A historian of the Vedic age can ill afford to ignore this fact.
Though what I have said so far relates mostly to the exter nals of the Veda, I believe that it has helped to prepare the ground for my main task today, which is to analyse the cultural background of the Veda For such an analysis, it would be
of the Vedic age into certain distinct periods. These periods may either be chronological or they may be logical. As it is, in the case of the Veda, as I shall endeavour to demonstrate presently, the chronological periods correspond surprisingly well with the logical periods.
The history of the antecedents of the Vedic Aryans? shows that certain tribes from the common Indo-European stock mi grated from their primary Utheimat in North Kirghiz towards the south-east and, in course of time, settled down in the region round about Balkh Here they seem to have lived for quite a long stretch of time - indeed, for so long a time that they soon began to regard that region itself as their original home. These people, who are generally known as the proto-Aryans, were the ancestors of the Vedic Aryans and the ancient Iranians. It was in the region round about Balkh that these proto-Aryans developed the Aryan language, which must be regarded as the parent of the Vedic language and the ancient Iranian language, and the Aryan religio-mythological thought, which eventually gave rise to the religions and the mytliologies of the Veda and the Avesta. In course of time there occurred further migrations of these proto Aryans - some warlike, adventurous tribes from among them left the region of Balkh and advanced towards the land of the seven rivers in their quest for fresh fields and pastures new, while other tribes of a more quiet and peaceful temperament gradually moved</li>

westwasds and finally settled down in a land, which later came to be called Iran, that is, āryānām (of the Aryans), the land of the Aryans. We are of course here concerned with the warlike tribes who advanced - often aggressively- towards the land of the seven rivers - the tribes who were the immediate forefathers of the early Vedic Indiabs. One of the main features of the Aryan religio-mythological thought which constituted the common heritage both of the early Vedic Aryans and the ancient Iranians, was its cosmic character. The Aryans, like their other Indo-European brethern, always lived close to nature. Their early religious thought was, therefore, conditioned by the peculiar way in which they reacted to the vastness, bounty, and brilliance of nature. Like their other Indo-European brethrea, the Aryans also gave expression to their sense of awe, occasioned by the vastness, bounty, and brilliance of nature, through the mythologi cal concept of the Father Sky &ndash; Vedic Dyauh or Greek Zeus, Vedic djauh pitar or Roman Jupiter. What must, however, be regarded as a unique contribution of the Aryans to mythological ideology is the striking advance which they made over this ancient Indo-European concept. The Aryans seem to have realised - and this realisation on their part, indeed, marks a distinctive stage in the development of human thought-that the universe or nature, vast as it is, is not an unregulated, haphazard entity but that it is governed by some definite law. In other words, the universe is not chaos; it is cosmos. The concepts of this cosmic law (the Vedic șta and the Avestan aša) and of the dispenser of this law (the cosmic magician Asura Varuna or Ahura Mazda ) are essen tially Aryan and, to a large extent, constitute the main theme of the common mythological heritage of the early Vedic Aryans and the ancient Iranian Aryans. The mantras relating to this, what may be called, cosmic religion, in both its aspects, the Dyauh aspect and the Rta-Varuna-aspect - which were produced by the ancestors of the early Vedic poet-priests may be said to represent the beginnings of the Veda. Another important feature of the Aryan religion was the fire-cult A comparative study of the Indo-European religions would show that the fire-cult, as such, is found only in the Vedic and the Avestan religions. Ignis, the
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
Latin counterpart of Agni, has no religious significance whatso. cver, and the worship of Roman Vestn ( the goddess of the hearth) and Greek Hestia can hardly be said to correspond with the fire-cult as it had been developed among the Aryans A mod tion must also be made in this context of the peculiar Soma Haoma-cult which had become a characteristic feature of the Aryan religio-mythological ideology. The Vedic poct-priests, like their Iranian compcers, must have produced several mantras relating to the fire-cult and the Soma-cult In addition to these two types of mantras, namely, the mantras relating to the cosmic religion and those relating to the firc-cult and the Soma-cult, which owe their origin to the common religio-mythological ideology developed by the Aryans, the direct ancestors of the Vedic Indians produced mantras relating to a religio-mythological idcology which was essentially their own. The ancestors of the early Vedic Indians were an aggressive, warlike people. Trom their secon. dary Urheimat in the region round about Ballh they set out on an adventurous campaign in the south-eastern direction. This their onward march was by no means smooth or uneventful They had to face, on the way, many natural impediments as also strong opposition from various antagonistic tribes, whom they collectivelly called the dāsas or the viras. But under the aegis
8 There is no doubt that the Soma cult as a religious cultus specifically proto Aryan in origin It is not attested in the religious idcology and practice of any other branch of the IE family The provenance of the original Soma plant, which played the central role in that cult, must, therefore, be sought in the region of Balkh The Mujarat mountain, which is mcrtioned in the Vedic literature (and in the desta ) as the home of Soma, can actually be shown to have been situated in that region It is, however, now difficult to As certain the identity of the original Soma plant The various identifications which have been suggested are, to my mind, not wholly convincing In course of time, the Vedic Aryans developed out of the Soma cult a highly complex and sophisticated Soma ritual In that connection, it may be pointed out that when they moved way from the Balkh Majavat region they found it difficult to oblain or cultivate the original Coma plant They, therefore, used, at different times and in different climes different substitutes for Soma which were presumably as near to the original Soma as possible from the points of view of the botanical character and effect However, to all such substitutes they gave the name
Soma'.

of their heroic leader, Indra, whom, incidentally, they later trans formed into their chief god, they successfully overcame all that opposition and eventually entered the Saptasindhu country. To suit this new phase in their cultural life, the Vedic Aryans evolved, in the course of their victorious campaign, a new type of religion. It was what may be called the hero-religion.
Broadly speaking, therefore, while living in the region of Balkh and during the course of their progress towards Sapta sindhu, the Vedic poet-priests produced mantras or prayers mainly relating to the three aspects of their religion - the cosmic religion, the fire-cult and the Soma.cuit, and the hero-religion. But this three-fold religio-mythological ideology cannot certainly be said to have covered the entire domain of religion of the Vedic Aryan community. By its very nature this ideology must have been rest ricted to the classes of poets, priests and warriors.10 Side by side with it, there must have been in existence, as among other primi tive peoples su too among the Vedic Aryans, the usual religion of the masses - the religion, that is to say, which comprised magic, witchcraft, superstition, etc. Naturally enough, there were pro duced mantras relating to this religion of magic as well. The word, mantra, is, indeed, a very remarkable word. It can be employed with reference to both the above-mentioned currents of the Vedic religious thought and practice. In relation to the ideo logy of the cosmic religion, the fire-cult and the Soma-cult, and the hero-religion, mantra may denote a prayer, while, in relation to the religion of magic, it may denote a magical formula or in cantation. These two types of mantras, relating to the two currents of religious thought and practice, which the Vedic Aryans produced in the region of Balkh and in the course of their victorious march towards Saptasındhu, constitute the beginnings of what, in later times, came to be called the Veda. In a sense,</li>

therefore, the Veda must be said to have been born outside India These mantras thus represent the first period of the literature of the Vedic age As I have tried to indicate, the character of the contents of the literature of the Vedic Aryans, during this period, was directly influenced by the peculiar way of their life and thought Not only this The form of that literature also was conditioned by their way of life. During this long stretch of time, the Vedic Aryans lived, as should be quite obvious, a no madıc, unsettled life Their literary creation, namely, the various mantras, also were correspondingly more or less unsettled and fluid in form They were not then given a fixed literary form They were being continually revised and modified These mantras, again, were all scattered about in an unorganised form In other words, the unsettled, unstable way of the life of the Vedic Aryans was reflected in the fluid and scattered condition of these mantras
As the culmination of a series of victorious battles which they fought on their way from Balkh to Saptasındhu under the sponsorship of Indra, who, as indicated earlier, had by this time been transformed from a heratc leader into the national war god, the Vedic Aryans entered the land of seven rivers (which, incidentally, must have included the present Afghanistan, the N. WF, and the major part of Panjab) ayowedly in order further to conquer, to colonise and to civilize It may be presumed that they were greatly impressed by the natural richness of Sapta sindhu Fertility of the soil, abundance of water, regularity of seasons, invigorating sunshine - all these environmental factors must have been responsible for the decision of the Vedic Aryans to settle down in that country Accordingly, in course of time, there arose in Saptasındhu various settlements and colonies of the Vedic Aryans Now they began to lead a more or less settled life And this change in their way of life had its inevit ablc effcct on their religious thought, practices, and literature The old mantras, produced by their immedinte ancestors were already there, though in a scattered condition Many of these were being revised and refined and generally given a fixed literary form New mantras also were being produced But what was
THE CULTURAL BACKGROUND OF THE VEDA

perhaps most significant in this connection was that the Vedic poet-priests Bow thought of collecting together all the old and Dew mantra material and organise and arrange it properly. This tendency to collect and arrange the large mass of scattered mantras only reflects the comparatively stable, settled, organised way of life which the Vedic Indians had developed by this time. All the old and new mantras were first brought together into two collec tions according to the character of the mantras - the mantras relating to the cosmic religion, the fire-cult and the Soma-cult, and the hero-religion (as also to the various other religio-mythological features which must have been evolved as a matter of coursell ) formed one collection or samhitä, and the mantras relating to magic, witchcraft, etc., formed the other collection or samhitā. It is needless to add here that we can speak of such classification of the mantras only in a very broad sense and mainly for the sake of the convenience of understanding. It must be emphasized that the characterisation of the mantras, included in the two collec tions, as belonging to one kind of religion or the other is by no means exclusive; it is necessarily representative.
locidentally, it may also be pointed out that even the term * religion employed in this context is, strictly speaking, not quite apposite. A critical student of the history of human thought particularly in so far as it pertains to man and his place in the universe - knows very well that that thought bas, broadly, deve loped through three distinct stages – the stage of magic, when man regarded himself essentially as a part of and not apart from the universe; the stage of religion in which man and universe (that is, spirit and matter) came to be differentiated from each other and both made subservient to a third entity, namely, god; and, finally the stage of science, which has again emphasized the peculiar kind of identity of the differentiated entities, namely, spirit and matter, Howsoever tantalizing this subject might be, I would hardly be justified in allowing myself such digression. I shall, therefore, only say this much, namely, that the early Vedic thought seems to</li>

oscillate between magic and religion?? - and now revert to my main theme.
The bringing into being of the two collections of mantras - this process is technically known as the samhitikarana - must be said to represent the second period of the history of the Vedic literature. This sanihuta-period followed the mantra-period both logically and chronologically. The samhıtā, which was mainly a collection of mantras relating to the cosmic religion, etc.- in other words, relating to the religious ideology and practice which had developed among the classes of poets, priests, and warriors - was called the Rgieda (RV); and the sarhitā which was mainly a collection of mantras relating to magic, etc. &ndash; in other words, relating to the religious ideology and practice of the masses - was called the Atharvaveda( AV). It was, of course, natural as also inevitable that some mantras of one kind should have found their way in the collection of the mantras of the other kind-that the so called Rgvedic prayers should have come to be included in the AV and the Atharvanic magical formulas in the RV. It is, therefore, only in a representative and not an exclusive sense that the RV can be characterised as the Veda of the classes and the AV as the Veda of the masses. Within these samhırās also, the mantras were not collected in a haphazard manner. A definite scheme was evolved and more or less scrupulosly stuck to. The mantras in the RV, which were grouped together to form various hymas, were first classified according to their authorship. It is interest ing to note how, in this respect also, a feature of the life of the Vedic Indians has significantly influenced their literary activity The scattered mantras in the mantra-period were regarded as essentially belonging to the community as a whole. This was just as it should be when people lived a truly communal life. After their early settlements in Saptasindhu, and, perhaps, as a result of these, however, the Vedic Indians seem to have developed a new pattern of social life in which family, in a larger sense, became</li>

the recognised social unit. It was, therefore, the authorship of a particular family which served as the criterion for classifying the hymns of the Rgveda. These hymns were no longer regarded as belonging to the community as a whole; they now came to be recognised as the literary production of specific families of Vedic poet-priests. The RV-samhita, accordingly, came to be divided into ten family books (which are called mandalas ) 13 Within these mandalas, again, there was further a fixed order in the arrangement of the hymns which was governed by the considera tion of the devatāsl4 and the extent of the hymns. We can speak of such samhitiharana, which implies the collection and the arran. gement of the scattered mantras according to certain fixed criteria, only in respect of the RV or the Veda of the classes. It is well known that what is known as the family-consciousness is not so very predominant among the masses. The principle of family-authorship has, therefore, not been applied to the AV or the Veda of the masses. The names of two ancient seers, Bhrgu and Angiras, are, no doubt, closely associated with that Veda. But a careful study will show that it is not so much to assert the authorship of their families that the names of Bhfgu and Angiras are originally connected with the AV; it is rather to emphasize the fact that the AV embodies the two types of magic which had been traditionally associated with the names of Bhrgu and Angi ras - the wholesome (that is, bhaişaja, santa, and pauşsika) magic of the Bhrgus and the black or exorcistic (that is ghora or ābhicărika) magic of the Angirasas.

The saṁhita-period saw the growing stability and prosperity of the Vedic Indians - both in political and social spheres, Theit original tribal settlements assumed, in course of time, the form of territorial states and monarchical kingdoms. Prominent among these latter were the kingdoms of the five tribal leaders - Pīru, Anu, Druhyu, Turvaša, and Yadu. The political prestige of these five kingdoms, indeed, became so great that the entire Vedic Indian community as against the original inhabitants of Sapta sindhu - came to be broadly characterised as pañca janäh-the five peoples-that is to say, the peoples coming under the political domination of the above-mentioned five states. At the same time, new and more adventurous tribes of immigrants were still pouring into the land of the seven rivers. One such tribe was the tribe of the Bharatas, who were making rapid progress under the military leadersbip of Sudās and the priestly guidance of Visvamitra. Sudās was a very ambitious person. It was his ambition to bring all the earlier Vedic Aryan kingdoms and settlements, including the five ones of Pūru, Anu, etc., under the political supremacy of the Bharatas. Between the pewly founded settlement of the Bharatas and the earlier five kingdoms of Püru, Anu, etc. there lay the powerful principality of the Trtsus, who presumably, were once closely connected with the Bharatas, Sudās, who was a great military leader, was also a shrewd statesman. He soon realised that, if he could win over the Titsus to his side as bis military and political allies, his campaign against the five states would be considerably facilitated and the chances of his dream of political supremacy coming true would be brighter. He, there. fore, started taking steps in that direction. The most influential personality among the Tytsus was their purohita, Vasistha Sudas offered Vasistha the office of the purohita of the valiant tribe of the Bharatas and in return demanded the political and military alliance of the Titsus. To cut a long story short, Sudās eventu ally disengaged his original purohita, Viśvā mitra, and appointed Vasistha in his place As the result of this strategy the BharatasTHE CULTURAL BACKGROUND OF THE VEDA

and the Tětsus came to form a single political and military unit with Sudās as their leader and Vasistha as their purohita. The germs of the notorious antagonism between the families of Vasi stha and Viśvāmitra are, perhaps, to be found in this ancient episode. Viśvāmitra was naturally enraged at this summary treatment given to him. He was certainly not a man to take things lying down. He, accordingly, went over to the five older kings and prepared them stroogly to resist the aggressive plans of Sudās. A military confederation of ten prominent kings was eventually formed for this purpose - a confederation, which com prised Vedic India as well as non-Aryan Indian elements. The battle between the Bharatas and the Trtsus on the one side and the confederation of ten kings on the other is traditionally known as the dāśarajña-yuddha (or, the battle of ten kings ). In this battle, which constitutes an important landmark in the early political history of the Vedic Indiaos, Sudās was ultimately victo rious and the Bharatas attained political domination - a domina tion, which, incidentally, they continued to enjoy for a long time afterwards and which, perhaps, gave India her name, Bhārata varsa. It was claimed that it was not only the military might of Sudās that was responsible for this victory. Far more efficaci ous, perhaps, in this connection was the magical potency of the mantras of Vasiştha ( sarjā irtsünám abharat purohiih-RV VII. 83. 4). All these and allied details regarding the battle of ten kings have found their rightful place in the RV.18
Far more significant, from our present point of view, than these political developments was the marked change in the social and economic life of the Vedic Iodians. Agriculture and cattle breeding were vigorously practised and these eventually paid good dividends. People as a whole were becoming generally rich and contented and their way of life also was becoming more complex, The new economy created in them a sense of security and, what is more pertinent, afforded them enough leisure. As is well known, it is this sense of security and leisure which helps to make a simplc religion complex. That is exactly what happened in

respect of the Vedic religion. The religion of the samhita-period - both of the classes and of the masses - must indeed be said to have been comparatively simple, particularly so far as its practices were concerned. But the changed conditions in the life of the Vedic Indians did not fail to react on the character of their religion. The character of the religion of a people is determined by the way of life of that people. Accordingly, the sense of prosperity and security newly achieved by the Vedic Indians and the ample leisure which they had now at their command encouraged them to make their older simple religion more elaborate and compli cated. As a matter of fact, quite a new religious cuit came to be evolved - the cult of Vedic sacrifice, which gradually superseded the ideology of cosmic religion, hero-religion, etc. It must be emphasized, at this stage, that the concept of sacrifice as such was not new to the Vedic Indians. Like all other primitive peoples they too had their own kind of sacrifice. What, how. ever, they did in the latter part of the samhita-period was to load the institution of sacrifice with innumerable and exceedingly como plicated details relating to such items as the number of sacred fires, the number of officiating priests, time and place of the per formance, formulas to be recited, oblations to be offered, utensils and other material to be used, etc. - details, which were, indeed, quite unheard of in connection with the primitive Aryan sacrifice and which were governed more by the rules of magic than of logic. They thus transformed the ancient cultish rites into a kind of systematized sacerdotalism. This new, complex institution of Vedic sacrifice naturally demanded a literature of its owo - a literature, that is to say, which would be devoted more or less exclusively to the discussion of the theory and practice of Vedic ritual. And such literature had, indeed, been in the making and it soon dominated the literary world of the Vedic Indians. It comprised the Yajurveda and the Samaveda, which, though tradı tionally characterised as sanihıtās, are, so far as the main trends and tendencies of their contents are concerned, actually subser vient to Vedic ritual, and more particularly the brahmanas. It is after these latter texts that I propose to call the third period of the history of the Veda as the brahmana-period,

The brālimaņas, as literary works, are as complex and com plicated in character as the theme with which they deal, namely sacrifice. In them, all the minute details of sacrifice were marshalled and discussed thread-bare&ndash;and this with such egre gious earnestness as to imply that nothing else mattered in the world Aod, in a sepse, nothing else but sacrifice did, indeed, matter so far as the Vedic Indians in that period were concerned For, sacrifice had become almost the centre of their entire religious life. It was no longer regarded as a means to an end; it became the end in itself. The authors of the brālnianas seem to wax eloquent when they have to debate even a petty point relating to the sacrificial procedure. Indeed, the pettier the point the more eloquent and earnest was the discussion about it. But, as a matter of fact, in the way of thinking of the Vedic poet-priests of this period, nothing relating to sacrifice could at all be petty or trifling. For, according to them, a sacrificc could either be per fect and blameless in all its minutest details and thus become completely efficacious or it could be deficient in one single minor detail and thereby become not only a failure, negatively, but posi tively operate as a source of danger and disaster. There was, in this respect, no half measure. It was because they failed to appreciate this peculiar ideology of the Vedic poet-priests that scholars like MAX MULLER were tempted to remark that the brāhmaṇas were &ldquo;simply twaddle&rdquo; and, what was worse, they were “theological twaddle&rdquo;. 18 And does such a remark not ignore several other significant features of the brâhmana texts, such as, for instance, those which pertain to the literary history of ancient India ? It seems to have been the claim of the authors of the brāhmanas-a claim, which, incidentally, it is impossible to uphold - that almost every Vedic mantra was primarily intended for being employed in connection with some or the other item of sacrifice. While, therefore, discussing the ritualistic purpose which the various mantras were expected to serve, the authors of the brāhmaṇas have incidentally given their own interpretations of those mantras. Tendentious though these interpretations may</li>

have often been, the fact cannot be gainsaid that, in a sense, the brahmanas constitute the earliest commentaries on the samlittås. Another significant feature of the brāhmaṇas is that, with the Krsna Yajurveda, they represent the first specimens of Sanskrit prose, The fact that the brahmanas have been written in prose is easily understandable; for, prose is often found to be more suitable for complex hair-splitting. The importance of the brahmanas as a repository of ancient legends must also not be overlooked in this context.
For our present purpose, however, it is the consideration of the social repercussions of the institution of sacrifice and of the brahmana texts that is more important. Sacrifice had beca loaded with so many details and its procedure had become so very complex and elaborate that it became absolutely impossible for an ordinary person to master those intricacies of ritual and adopt it as a form of worship on his own. The natural conse quence of this was that an independent class of priests gradually came into being. The character and functions of these new ritual-priests were obviously different from those of the poet priests of the mantra- and the samhita-periods. These new ritual-priests now assumed the position of the inevitable inter mediaries between man and his socio-religious objectives. A worshipper (or, to be more precise, a sacrificer) was now more or less a passive factor in the entire sacrificial procedure. Preparations for the sacrifice were made, formulas were recited, and oblations were offered by the various officiating priests, while the sacrificer himself was there only in name, for, all this was apparently being done in his name. As has been already pointed out, sacrifice had become almost the sole object of the socio religious interests of the Vedic Indians in that period. Io some ways, it may have also promoted various other activities subservient to it. But all that was only incidental. The more serious repercussions of this all-pervading power of sacrifice are indeed to be seen elsewhere. The master-key to the whole sacrificial system was in the exclusive keeping of the newly arisen class of priests, who indulged vociferously in the intricate details of that cult and
THE CULTURAL BACKGROUND OF THE VEDA
89
who must have, in their own interest, continued to multiply those details. It was, therefore, but natural that, in course of time, this class should have dominated and, to a certain extent, exploited the credulity of the other classes in the Vedic society. People were not entitled to ask questions regarding the validity or significance of the various sacrificial details. For, as the priests claimed, every one of those details was duly prescribed and sanctioned by the scriptures. And the correct interpretation of those scriptures was, of course, the one which the priests themselves offered. This state of things engendered among the people at large a sort of intellectual slavery-an attitude of blind acceptance. The brâhmaņa-period thus saw the social and intellectual domination of the priestly class over the other classes of society.
The next period, namely, the upanısad-period, is essentially a logical consequence of the brāhmana-period. History has shown us that the domination of one class of people over the other classes cannot continue for a long time. Sooner or later a violent reaction against that domination is bound to make itself felt. There did, accordjogly, arise, in the upanişad-period, a band of new thin kers who boldly challenged the spiritual validity of the sacri ficial system and even the authority of the scriptures on which that system was claimed to have been based. The attitude of in quiry now arose gandually to replace the attitude of acceptance. The banner of free thinking was raised and people were encouraged to think for themselves and to ask questions. And questions they did ask with an exuberance which was but natural after a long period of intellectual confioement. Their questions extended from such naive one as if the cow is red, why should her milk be white?' to such profoupd opes as those relating to the pature of man, universe, and the ultimate reality. Though the upanisads deal with these latter questions more or less exclusively and thus mark, in a sense, the beginnings of the philosophical literature of India, they cannot be said to embody any system of philosophy in the strictest sense of the term. They indeed constitute but

about the shifting of emphasis from the mere form of religion to the true spirit of religion Brahmanical ritualism made place for upanısadıc spiritualism The teachers of this new spiritualism did not come necessarily from the older priestly class Indeed, there were instances where the members of the priestly class went over to the members of the non priestly classes and the members of the socially higher classes went over to the members of the socially lower classes for instruction and enlightenment This certainly helped to counteract, at least to a certain extent. the exclusiveness of the earlier period In view of what has been said so far, and only to the extent indicated, the upanısads may be charac terised as the harbingers of a social and intellectual revolt The upanısadıc teachers threw open to all classes, witbout any distinc tion, the doors of philosophical knowledge and religious practice lo a sense, they may be said to have promoted what may be called a spiritual democracy
So far, however as the history of Vedic life and thought, as such, is concerned, all this achievemept of the upanısads, remark able as it is, seems to have been outweighed by certain pecuhar weaknesses of their teachings For one thing, the teachings of the upanı sads cannot be said to have been quite suitable to the common man For, the proper understanding and realisation of those teachings demanded a high intellectual level and an austere spiritual discipline The absence in the upanısads of any consistent system of thought and the generally mystic character of their doctrines were hardly likely to appeal to the people Again, the upadisadıc teachings were far too individualistic to be able to hold people together even in a spiritual brotherhood The upanısadıc period did not produce any one single leader of thought upder whose banner people could muster aod forge ahead in their spiritual quest A multiplicity of teachers and thinkers - all equally great-, more often than not, proves a disadvantage Similarly the emphasis put by the upanısadıc teachers on abstract metaphysical thought and the ideal of renunciation made them entirely neglect the practical aspect of the spiritual life of the people In other words,

the upanisads gave to the people some philosophy but no religion. Though, therefore, what the upanışads aimed at and what they actually achieved was really great, their influence as a whole seems to have been short-lived. Consequently, from the point of view of the evolution of Vedic thought and life, the upanişadic period was followed by a break in the continuity - by an interregnum.
This interregnum saw the growth of what are usually called the heterodox systems of thought-particularly of Jainism and Buddhism. It is possible to trace the beginnings of many of the essential tenets of these systems to pre-Vedic proto-Indian thou ght-complex This latter, as we saw, was, in the meantime, superseded - though superficially - by the Vedic Aryan thought, Now, however, in the peculiar circumstances created by the upa nişadic period, that thought began to assert itself in various ways and forms. The upanişads had already inaugurated an era of free thinking. They had challenged the traditionally accepted authority of the Vedic scriptures. They had also helped to liberalise, to some extent, the exclusive social order sponsored by Brahmanism. This was, indeed, a most propitious background for the promo tion of the heterodox systems of thought. These systems not only took advantage of that background but considerably streng thened their own position by avoiding the weak points from which the upanisads suffered. For instance, in contrast with the upa nisads, they offered a more or less consistent teaching By laying perhaps a greater emphasis on ethical conduct than on mere abstract contemplation they made their appeal truly all-compre hensive. They had realised the importance of missionary activity in the field of spiritual life and, through their sanghas, they approached the people at large with the message that religion and philosophy, in their broadest sense, did not constitute a preserve intended only for a select few but that every one, who possessed the necessary carnestness and faith, could avail himself of them. And, above all, these heterodox movements of thought had the unique advantage of the inspiring leadership of outstandiag per. sonalities like Buddha and Mahīvira. The Vedic way of life and thought, which had, by thea, developed up to the upanişadıc
92
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
stage, suffered greatly on account of these new forces. Though it cannot be said to have been completely overwhelmed by them, it did receive a set-back. Apart from the growing strength of the heterodox systems of thought, this period of set-back also saw the reaction to the ideal of complete renunciation of this-worldly life, sponsored by the upanısads, in the form of the enunciation of of new ideals in polity and social regeneration.
But, after all, this period proved to be only an interregnum. There had still remained many enthusiastic adherents of the Vedic way of life and thought though they had become temporarily dormant. They now consolidated their forces with a view to resuscitating their ancient heritage. They had learnt from expe rience that, in order to accomplish this resuscitation, it would be necessary to reorganise, systematize, simplify, and popularise the entire Vedic way of life and thought. Fresh literary efforts were, accordingly, made in this direction - efforts, which must be be said to have inaugurated the fifth and the last period of Vedic literary history. The principal literary works of this period, which are obviously meant to be ancillary to the Veda, are characterised by the unique literary form which had been developed about this time, namely the sutra-form. This period may, therefore, be called the sūtra-vedānga period. The Vedic teachers started by producing three kinds of sūtras - the Srauta-sūtra, the grhya-sutra, and the dharma-sutra, wlich may, broadly speaking, be said to relate respectively to the religious aspect, the personal and domes tic aspect, and the social and political aspect of the life of the Vedic Indians. They also produced several other works which served as efficient aids to the study and understanding of the Veda, The history of ancient India shows that this comprehen sive cultural movement, which was started with a view to reorga Dising, consolidating, and popularising the Vedic way of life and thought, yielded fairly striking results.
Such then are the extent, the nature, and the cultural back ground of the Veda. I have so far spoken of the various periods of the history of the Veda. Let me, however, hasten to add that these periods can by no means be demarcated in a hard and fast

manner. I am, indeed, often tempted to compare the Veda with a rainbow. Just as it is not possible precisely to mark out where one colour of the rainbow ends and the other begins - one colour almost imperceptibly fades out into the other - even so it is not possible to say where one Vedic period ends and the other begins, for, the trends and tendencies of one period, not infrequently, pass on to the next and then gradually become extinct. There is also another significant aspect of this metaphor. Does the Veda, like a rajobow, not constitute one of the most remarkable exam ples of unity in diversity ?17

<p>(1) There seem to have been two major waves of migration of the Aryans into India The early tribes left the region of Balkh ( where their ancestors had lived for a fairly long time) and, after a long and arduous journey in the course of which they had to encounter various impediments (both natural and human), eventually reached the land of the Seven Rivers (Sapla Sindhu) The fertility of the soul the abundance of water, the regularity of seasons, the bright sun shine-these were among the many eco logical factors which prompted them ultimately to settle down in that region (which roughly tocluded parts of Afgh70istan, the NWF, and Panjab) Their tribal organization then came to be gradually transformed into territorial states Five such Aryan states became particularly prominent in the early period of the Aryan settlement in Sapta Sindhu, namely, Puru, Anu Druhyu, Turvasa, and Yadu It was presumably after these five states tbat the early Aryan settlers were collectively called Panica Japah (Five Peoples) Side by side with these Aryan settlements, there were in existence in and round about that region a few non Aryan (indigenous Indian) settlements as well
(2) The second wave of the Aryan immigrants was more homo geocous in character in that it was constituted of a single major tribe-the tribe of the Bharatas Sudās, the leader of the Bharatas,THE DĀŠARĀJÑA
who were presumably few in number, was a very ambitious man. He aimed at bringing the early Aryan settlements (collectively called Pañca Janāh) and the indigenous non-Aryan principalities under his control and thereby establish the sovereignty of the Bharatas throughout the Aryandom (Sapta-Sindhu). Sudās appears to have been as much an intrepid warrior as a wise statesman. He was convinced that, in order to achieve his goal, diplomacy and military strategy would both be equally necessary.
(3) To the north-west of the early Aryan settlements there was the fairly powerful state of the Títsus. It would seem that, while the Titsus were independent of the Pañca Janāh, they had originally been related to the Bharatas. The new comer, Sudās, realised that, with a view to overpowering the Pañca Janah and the neighbouring non-Aryan principalitics, he would have to win over the Tștsus to his side. Accordingly he devised a shrewd stratagem to establish a political and military alliance with them.
(4) In the socio-political organization of the early Vedic Aryans, tlie Purohita played a role which was as important as - jf not more important than that of the king or the tribal leader. Spiritual Authority and Temporal Power-Sacerdotium and Regnum-went hand in hand. It can be seen from the Rgveda that, in the initial stage, the Purohita of the Bharatas was Bharadvāja. However, while they were advancing into Sapta Sindhu, Bharadvāja&rsquo;s place was taken by Viśvāmitra. Vasiştha was the Purohita of the Titsus, and was, accordingly, the most influential person in the cian of the Trtsus. Sudās knew that, if he could sway Vasiştha in favour of the Bharatas, his purpose would be adequately served. By a bold stroke of diplomacy, he managed to dispense with the services of Viśvāmitra and offered to Vasistha the office of the Purohita of the victoriously progressing clan of the Bharatas. Vasiştha accepted the offer, and, as the result of this, an alliance was established between the Bharatas and the Trtsus, with Sudās as their military com mandant and Vasistha as their Purohita—the ultimate aim of the alliance having been the Bharata sovereigoty in the Aryandom. .

(5) But Vośvāmitra was not a man to take such things lying down. Embittered by the supercilious treatment meted out to him (cf. RV III. 53 23 ), he went over to the Pañca Japāh, woke them up to the danger of the impending invasion by the Bharatas, and eventually manoeuvred them into forming a kind of loose military confederation for the purpose of arresting the Bharata onslaught He also hoped thereby to avenge the indignity which he had been made to suffer. It may be presumed that this con federation, which came to be known as the Ten Kings (Dasa Rājāpah), consisted of the five states of the early Aryan settlers and some neighbouring non-Aryan principalities. Obviously, the number ten' in this context has to be understood as being only generally descriptive rather than definitive. The names of some of the leaders and members of the confederation&ndash; Aryan (Pūru, Turvaša, Druhyus, Ādava, etc.) and non-Aryan (Pakthas, Bhalānases, Visānins, Śimyu, etc )-are actually mentioned in the Rgvedic hymns relating to this subject.
(6) The two sides arrayed themselves against each other the Bharatas and the Titsus led by Sudás and Vasistha on one side and the Ten Kings presumably under the leadership of Bheda and assisted by Viśvāmitra, among others, as their Purohita, on the other for the eventful war which has been described in the Veda as the Dāśarājõa or the War of the Ten Kings. (The word dāśarăjña itself occurs only three times in the Rgveda) The war consisted of many battles and skirmishes (though there is no evidence to suggest that it extended over several generations ), but the decisive battle seems to have been fought on the bank of the river Parusni (modern Rāvi). Under the benign aegis of the Aryan war-god Indra and with the help of Vasistha&rsquo;s efficacious priestcraft (purohui), Sudas won the final victory and thus suc ceeded in establishing the sovereignty of the Bharatas in the region of Sapta-Sindhu. I believe that the source of the name Bhāratavarsa by which India came to be known is to be sought in this great historical event. This event, again, is the basis of the many versions of the traditional rivalry between the families of Vasiştha and Viśvāmitra.
The DĀŠARĀJÑA
97
(7) I must hasten to add that the Dāśarajña has nowhere in the Vedic literature been described in a consistent and connected narrative. In the Agreda, apart from a few stray references in the third and the sixth Mandalas, fairly detailed references to it occur in hymns 18, 33, and 83 of the seventh Mandala. The Dāšarājña is also referred to, directly or indirectly, in the Maitrājani-Samhita III. 3.7, the Kathaka-Samhilă 21.10, the Jaiminiya-Brāhmana 3.244, the Tandya-Brāhmana 15.3.7, the Kausitaki-Upanişad 3.1, and the Great Epic. I have collated the relevant material from the various versions of the Dasarājñia, have tried to eliminate the inconsistencies and deficiencies in them as far as possible, and have reconstructed a plausible history mainly with the help of constructive imagination.

<p>THE TWO BIRTHS OF VASISTHA A FRESH STUDY OF RGVEDA VII 33. 9-141

It is suggested that every regular family book (mandala ) of the Rgveda contains what may be called a family-hymn, the main purpose of which is to glorify the progenitor of the family and to celebrate some special attainments and characteristic cxploits of that family as a whole Such family hymds usually occur at the end of the group of hymas relating to Indra, for, it is believed that the peculiar distinction achieved by the family is essentially the result of Indra&rsquo;s benign favour. The thirty third hymn in the seventh mandala of the Rgveda has, accord 10gly, to be regarded as the family-lıymn of the Vasisthas who are traditionally recognised as the authors of that mandala ?
The Anukramanı of Katyāyana characterises RV VII 33 as a samstava, which term is explained by the commentator Sad gurusisya as sahastuti In other words, according to Kätyāyana, the hymn contains mutual laudation by Vasistha, the progenitor of the family, and his descendants As the commentator has ela borated, in the first nine stanzas, Vasistha praises his descendants,

while, in the last five, the descendants praise their great ancestors According to Saunaka&rsquo;s Brhaddevată (V 163 ff ), the hymn is a dialogue-hymn — the Sarianukramanı also alternatively suggests : vasişthasja saputrasye &lsquo;ndrena 1ā samvadah &ndash; or it is merely an Indrasukta, a hymn in praise of Indra Both these views, how ever, seem to be upacceptable
Actually the present hymn is a kind of ballad which seeks to glorify Maitrāvarun Vaststha, the progenitor of the Vasistha family, and shows many of the characteristics of a ballad For instance, like a ballad, it is made up partly of direct speech, whereby either the bard himself assumes the roles of the different characters in the story and speaks out their speeches (1 and 4. of Indra, 14 of Agastya) or he rhetorically addresses the person who is being glorified, samely, Maitrāvaruni Vasistha (as in 10 and 11), and partly of narration in the third person The hymn is further characterised by such features as repetition (eg be gingings of the first three quarters of 3, 9 cd and 12 cd), ellipsis (9, 10, 14 ), absence of proper sequence of stanzas, impromptu addition (12 b), and parenthesis (12 a), which are common to oral poetry like ballad + That the central theme of this hymn 15 the glorification of Vasistha is skilfully brought out by the poet by deliberately introducing the word vasistha, whether in singular or in plural and in different cases, in all its stanzas, In this connection, it may be pointed out that, even where the word occurs in plural, it can be understood as referring to the progenitor of the family himself, the plural having been used as a token of respect (ādararthe)
3 GELDNER (Der Rig Veda, Part II, p 211 ) adds A Vási tha as the tpokesman of the whole family proclaims, in the presence of his ancestor, the latter&rsquo;s glory and indirectly that of his descendants Indra joins in this glori fication and supplements (st 1 4) as it were the parralion by that Vísisha

This family hymn of the Vasisthas can be divided into three clear-cut sections (a) 1-6 Vasistha personally called upon Indra (st 1 abhi pra manduh, the Gopatha-Brahmana 2 2 13 also says that Vasistha was the only seer who had personally seen Indra sayo va indram pratyaksam na &lsquo;paśyams tam asistha eva pratyaksam apaśyat) and won him over to his own side, that is to say, to the side of the Trtsus and the Bharatas (2), and, through Indra&rsquo;s favour (3) and Vasistha&rsquo;s priestcraft (4) prayers (5), and leadership (6) the Trtsu-Bharatas became victorious in the Dasarajña, (b) 78 Vasistha was a master of mystic knowledge and inimitable priestly prowess, and (c) 9-14 the two births of Vasistha It will be easily realised that the sequence of these three sections should properly have been the other way round namely, first, the section dealing with Vasistha&rsquo;s double birth, secondly, the one eulogising the special attainments of Vasistha, and, finally, the one celebrating the victory in the Daśarajña
The story of Vasistha&rsquo;s birth has, obviously, to be regarded as the core and kernel of this whole hymn For, it is, indeed, the peculiar character of the birth of Vasistha which may be said to distinguish him essentially from the other Vedic seers More over, while the other two topics namely, Vasistha&rsquo;s priesterait and his positive role in the Dasarajña, have occurred in several other passages in the seventh book, a more or less detailed refe rence to his miraculous birth is to be found only in the present hymn Four things need to be clearly borne in mind before any attempt is made to analyse the section dealing with the birth of Vasistha (9-14) First, the various stages in this story have not been set forth here in their proper sequence It is, therefore, necessary to rearrange many of the quarters (pādas )

of these six stanzas so as to make them yield a logically consistent account. Secondly, the word vasiştha, whether used in singular or in plural in these stanzas, is invariably to be understood as referring to the progenitor of the family of the Vasisthas. Thirdly, the various features of ballad-poetry, mentioned above, parti cularly ellipsis and mixing up of third person narration and second person locution are quite conspicuous in this part of the hymn. And lastly. this hyma evidently constitutes a kind of an appendix to the original Samhita - among other things, it does not have the usual refrain - and thus contains many ideas which are reminiscent of a slightly later age.
The poet begins by proclaiming (9 ab) that he (te : used ādararthe), that is, Vasistha, alone (11), on account of the light of his heart (hrdayasya praketaih) or inper vision, moves about freely in, that is to say, is quite familiar with abhi saṁ caranti) the thousand-branched mystery sahasravalsam ninyam) that this manifold and multifarious phenomenal world is. The use of the present tense, in this context, is intended to suggest that such knowledge was natural and innate to Vasiştba. Since Vasiştha already possessed that knowledge, he did not feel either any curio sity or any enticement in respect of being born in this world and actually experiencing the various vicissitudes of the worldly life or saṁsära. And yet, he did become inclined to take birth in this world, because, as the poet tells us (9 c), he wanted to weave fur ther (vayantah) the garment (paridhn) which Yama had started weaving (yamena tatam ). Yama was, according to the Vedic mythology, the progenitor of the human race. This idea is ex pressed here through the imagery of the starting of the weaving of a garment. Every one is obligated to see that the weaving of this garment, which Yama has initiated, continues uninterrupted ly, lest the buman race itself may otherwise eventually disappear from the face of the earth. It is verily this reasoning which

underl.es the concept of pier-rna (= debt which one owes to his fathers), which is one of the three major debts that it is incumbent on every one to requite.10 Vasistha thought of taking birth in this world not because he was in any way enamoured of this samsåra - he alreadly had the innate knowledge of all its secrets, good and evil, without having had to get physically involved in it; but there was this obligation of ensuring the uninterrupted conti. nuity of the human race.
The pādas 9 ab are usually interpreted as if they referred to Vasistha&rsquo;s behaviour after his advent in this world. Vasistha is said to have moved about fearlessly within the thousandfold mystery of this world. 11 This is, however, too literal and obviously pointless. Moreover, with such an interpretation, the words hrdaj asya praheraih would lose all their significance. So too would the reference to the weaving further of the garment of the human race. This latter reference actually provides a definite cosmic-ethical motivation for the event of Vasistha&rsquo;s birth, and undoubtedly elevates, though perhaps indirectly, the character ol Vasistha. The poet seems to have been particular about this point. That is why he repeats that statement once more in 12 cd, where, incidentally, the desiderative sense is clearly brought out (vayisyan). The deliberate use, in 9 ab, of the present tense abhi san caranti, which verb, in view of the phrase hrdayasya praketaih, is necessarily to be understood in a figurative sense, and of the narrative past (upa seduh) in 9 cd, should not be underestimated. The verse-halves, 9 ab and 9 cd, have, therefore, to be syntactically joined to each other with some such words as
and yet words which the bard presumably did utter while singing the ballad. It was only with a view to fulfilling his cosmic ethical obligation of promoting the continuity of the human race that Vasistha, as the poet tells us (9 d), approached the celestial nymph (apsarasah: plural ādararthe) with reverence (upa seduh)

THE TWO BIRTHS OF VASISTHA

due to a mother.12 The päda 12 d confirms this by stating that Vasistha was born of the celestial nymph (apsarasaḥ pari jajñe pasisthah). How did this happen?
Once upon a time, Mitra-Varuņa (Mitrāvarunau ) were pre vailed upon by means of salutations (13 a : isitä namobhih) to attend a long Soma-sacrificial session (sattra), which was being performed by Viśve Devāh (mentioned in 11 d). Indeed, they were ioitiated to officiate as priests (jätau) at that saftra. There they happened to see the celestial nymph Urvasi (mentioned in 11 b), who was also present at the satira presumably to participate in the ritual drama connected with the sattra, and, were intensely allured by her superb beauty. They could not control their passion, and, suddenly and simultaneously (13 b: samânam) discharged their fecundating fluid (relah sisicatuh ), which was eventually collected in a jar (kumbhe).
The dual of jātau and işıtā (in 13 a) leaves no doubt that those two participles have to be connected with Mitrāvaruņā, who have been mentioned in 10b - mitrāı arunā being the only noun in dual in the present context. The phrase satire ha (13 a) is interpreted variously. It is read (against the Samhitāpātha and the Padapătha) as satrā ha; and the phrase satrā ha jātau (= verily, born together ) is then understood as emphasizing the simultaneous birth of Mitra-Varuna.13 It will, however, be agreed that the mention of the simultaneous birth of Mitra Varuna has no relevance whatsoever to the main theme. More over, changing the reading sattre ha to satrā ha would seem to be quite upwarranted. It is alternatively suggested that one might analyse sattre lia in the Sanhitāpātha as safrā iha (against the Padapātha ): Mitra-Varuna arrived (jätau = prāptau) at that place (tha) together (satra). Such a reference too is hardly pertinent. On the other hand, it may be pointed out that, with out the assumption of a satira, it would be very difficult ratio

Dally to explain the simultaneous presence of Mitra-Varuna Viśve Devāh, and Uryası at one and the same place 16 In the present context, the word jātau is used in the technical sense of diksitau (initiated) The Artareya Brahmana (VII 22 4), for instance, clearly states that one who gets himself initiated is, 10 deed, born again from the sacrifice yajñād u ha vă esa punar jāyale yo dik sate Mitra Varuna did not attend that sattra as its dividities It is also obvious that, in that sattra, they were initiated as officiating priests and not as sacrificer ( Yajamāna), for, they are said to have been persuaded with salutations to be present at the sattra and accept the priestly office Attention may be incidentally drawn here to the character of Mitra Varuna as divine priests 16 It may also be presumed that the Maitrāvaruna, who is one of the sixteen principal priests of the later Vedic ritual, has something to do with the priestly character of Vedic Mitra Varuna For, while the names of most of these sixteen priests are indicative of their specific functions in the ritual, that of the Maitrāyaruna seems to have been directly derived from his divine prototype
The suggestion that Mitra Varuna were seduced by Urvasi by means of obeisance ([ urvaśyā] namobhih 15ıtā) in attending the sattra is evidently unwarranted it clearly militates against Urvasi&rsquo;s role in this drama as indicated in 11 b (it would, indeed, appear from 9 d that Urvasi did not take any initiative but had to be induced to mother Vasistha ), against the statement in 13 b (which suggests suddenness of action on the part of Mitra Varuna), and also against the usual story-motif prevailing in similar situations in Indian legends It would seem that, when Mitra-Varuna happened to have a glimpse of Urvasi, their erotic emotion was roused and they could not control the consequent sudden (as seems to have been implied by the word samānam ) discharge of their semen.

not be wasted or should not cause any damage by falling on the ground, it was made to flow into, that is, it was collected in a jar.16 Before proceeding with the further details of the central theme of Vasistha&rsquo;s birth, the poet tells us ( 13 cd )- almost parenthetically-that, out of that semen (tatah), verily (ha), arose ( ud iyāja) Māna or Agastya from the middle ( madhyāt) of the jar, 17 and that the seer born out of that very semen they call Vasistha (tato jātam rsim āhur vasistham).18 The words fatah madhyāt (13 c) are also interpreted as tasya kumbhasya madhyāt (from the middle of that kumbha) and tataḥ (13 d) as tasmāt kumbhat bahh (outside the kumbha)! But this is rather farfetched and also unnecessary. It is, however, possible to understand tatah (in 13 d) in the sense of thereafter&rsquo;, for, Vasiştha is traditionally believed to have been born after Agastya and to have accordingly been Agastya&rsquo;s younger brother,20
Now to revert to the main theme (11 cd ). While the fecun dating fluid of Mitra-Varuna was being collected in the jar (13 b), a drop of it fell out. But the sacrificers Vißve Devāh, pre sumably apprehensive of the disaster which that drop might cause if it was allowed to reach the ground, promptly held it fast upon a lotus (drapsaṁ skannam višye devah puskare adadanta). It was of course by no means easy to tackle with that concentrate of virsle power, but Viśve Devāh were cnabled to do so with the help of the divine, magically potent spell (darvyena brahmana)

wbich they commanded 21 And here the bard, rhetorically addressing Vasistha, says In that Viśve Devāh held up that drop of the semen of Mitra-Varuna on a lotus, they actually &quot; held you&rdquo; (na adadanta) 22 It may be added that, in this context, the word två is used proleptically
How this was so is explained in 10 ab This passage is ex ceedingly elliptical As has been mentioned above, Vasistha wanted to take birth in this world in order to weave further the web of Yama He now saw the most propitious opportunity to do so Moving away from, that is to say, abandoning his natural essential existence, Vasistha, like a flash of lightning as it were (vidyuto jyotih [ iva), entered into the drop of the semen of Mitra-Varuna, which had been held up on a lotus by Viśve Devāh, with a view to taking birth out of that drop The imagery of the flash of lightnjog suggests, on the one hand, the resplendence that constituted the original basic form of Vaşistha, and, on the other, the spontaneity with which Vasistha decided to avail himself of the unique opportunity for carrying out his cosmic ethical mission Approvingly, Mitra Varuna watched Vasistha abandoning (part sam pihånam, in the secondary seose) his natural essential form and entering into the drop of their semen and blessed him When (yad in 10 b) this happeged, an important phase of the great event of Vasistha&rsquo;s first birth may be said to have been accomplished (10 c) Incidentally it may be pointed out that it is possible to interpret 10 a as (When Mitra Varuna saw you) going away from your original lightning ( splendour-) form (vidyutah ab! ) to the mass of light (Jyoth acc ), that is to say, to the drop of semen But, as indicated above, the earlier interpretation would seem to be poetically more apposite

Varuna. She also realised that a female agency, in some form or the other, was necessary in the process of the germination of that seed. Presumably the poet wanted to suggest that Urvasi received some kind of inner reverential appeal from Vasistha himself this might be implied by 9 d: apsarasah upa sedur vasisthāh&ndash; and was thereby induced to act as she did. She meditated upon that seed, and this eventually resulted in the birth of Vasıştha,23 “ You, o Vasistha &ldquo;, says the bard addressing him, &ldquo;are, verily, the child of Mitra-Varuna, and at the same time, you, o Brahman, are born from the mind of Urvašī&rdquo; (11 ab). The appellation, Brabman, may be taken to have been used here proleptically.** The interpretation of urvaśyāḥ in, 11 b as an ablative form (&ldquo;born from Urvašī— from [her] mental power&rdquo;) is rather odd. Similarly to suggest that urvaśyah may be understood as an object-genitive and may be figuratively connected with manas in the sense of passion&rsquo; (&rsquo;t born out of the passion (of Mitra Varuna for Urvası”) is ingenious, but it manifestly misses the main point. The word manas in this context denotes the mental activity on the part of Urvasi. She fixed her mind (abhidhyāna) on the drop of the semen of Mitra-Varuna caught up by Viśve Devāh on the lotus, thereby exercising her volition (sanikalpa) that a son be born out of that drop. The birth of Vaşiştha was not the result of any normal physical activity - Vasistha was not yonija - and this fact at once establishes the superhuman cha racter of his birth.25
“This, then &ldquo;, says the poet, &ldquo;was your one (first) birth (10 c).20 When Agastya took you ( and introduced you) to the clan (of the Tetsus; cf. St. 6), (there occurred your other
23. It would thus be clear why, in Il cd, the holding up of the drop of the semen (drapsa) on the lotus was regarded as being tantamount to the holding of Vasıfsha himself (fa). Attention has already been drawn to the proleptic use of tua in that context.

(of gods to the clan of men But this is unacceptable, for, there has been no indication whatsoever of Vasistha&rsquo;s having belonged to the clan of gods It is possible to take visah as accusative plural (of course, ignoring the accent) and translate : &ldquo;When Agastya brought you over to the Tștsu people (cf St 6)&rdquo; But, idiomati cally, the accusative would not go quite well with a jabhara Under these circumstances, one would feel inclined to ignore the Pada pātha and read yıse (dat sing 28
Before proceeding to elaborate the second birth of Vasistha the bard proclaims (12 a) presumably with a view to reiterat ing the initial statement made by him in 9 ab, that “ (Vasistha ), being endowed with inner light ( sapraketah), had the full prior knowledge (pravidvan) of both ( ubhayasya) (his births)” It may be noted that the word sapraketah establishes a corres pondence between 12 a and 9 ab, which seem to echo each other This correspondence is further confirmed by the near identity of 9 cd and 12 cd However, here again we have to go against the Samhitāpātha and the Padapatha and read sapraketah instead of sa praketah (which latter would hardly make any sense) One cannot think of interpreting praketah as an adjective, for, if no where occurs in the Rgveda as an adjective Nor would it be natural to read prakete (loc ) and translate it with “in (that is, on account of his inner light&rdquo; In view of the whole context, there is hardly any doubt that ubhayasya refers to the two births and not, as sometimes suggested, to the two worlds, heaven and earth, or to the two peoples, divine and human The pada 12 b contains some kind of impromptu statement made by the bard, but its sense is not at all clear

Mitra-Varuņa and Urvasi were responsible for bringing Vasistha into this phenomenal world. But mere biological birth was not going to help Vasiştha in the fulfilment of his cosmic ethical mission. It was at best only a necessary precondition. What was now needed was what may be called a social birth or a socio-ethical personality.29 Agastya, the elder brother, is, there fore, said to have presented Vasistha to the clan of the Títsus urging them to receive him as their Purohita.30 Addressing the Trtsus, Agastya says: &ldquo;Here would Vasiştha come unto you, o Pratrds (14 d); do you receive him with honour, entertaining good will (for him)” (14c). The Pratçds32 are evidently to be identified with the Tįtsus mentioned in st. 6 of this hymn. For one thing, both names are derived from the same root trd. Further, the name Prated would easily remind one of Pratardana who was one of the early kings of the Trtsu-Bharatas.92
What is, however, particularly important for our present pur pose is that, while introducing Vasistha to the Pratsds, Agastya emphasizes the special priestcraft of Vasistha (14 ab). The pâdas 14 ab are variously explained. It is suggested that 14 ab form a part of the narrative, while 14 cd constitute the direct address of Agastya to the Títsus. In that case, bibharti ( narrative present) in 14 a is connected with ā jabhāra in 10 d. and its subject is taken to be Agastya. Agastya, bearing the Soma-crush ing stone (grāvānam bibhrat; grāyan to be understood as the symbol of the Adhvaryu&rsquo;s office), that is, in his capacity as the Adhvaryu, takes (bibharti) Vasiştha, who is a bearer of Ukthas (that is, a master of the Rgvedic ritual; Hotr) and a bearer of Sāmans (that is, a master of the Sámavedic ritual; Vågāts), to the Trtsus, and announces before them (agre pra vadāti: &ldquo;Here would Vasistha . etc.&rdquo;. It must, however, be pointed
29. In a similar context, the Manusmp. II. 147-148 uses the two signi ficant words, sathbhan and jāli,

out that strictly speaking the root hhr has two altogether diffe rent senses in bibhart, and a jabhira There is, again no point in referring to Agastya as the Adhvaryu And, finally, the charac terization of Vasıştha as a master of both the Rgicdic and the Sāmavedic rituals is quite unwarranted A far better sense could be derived from st 14, if that whole stanza was regarded as consti tuting the speech of Agastya &ldquo;(This one, here ) &ldquo;, says Agastya to the Titsus ( 14 ab), &ldquo;supports (bibharti) the supporter of Ukthas (the Hot) and the supporter of Sūmans (the Udgült), (and he also supports him who) is the supporter of the Soma crushing stone (the Adhvaryu ) (elliptical, jah) gravanam bibhrat (sarjate tam api bibliariil), and (he alone) may speak with authority in front of all of them (agre pra vadall)&rdquo; 11 will be clear that this entire description in 14 ab applies aptly to the Brahman Agastya eulogiscs Vasistha as the Brahman par excellence The significance of the appellation brahman prolepti cally used with reference to Vasistha in 11 b may now be properly realised The Brahman generally supervises and maintains in order (bibharti) the activities of the other three principal priests (who are here denoted by means of the symbols of their special functions, namely, Uktha, Saman and graian) It is again the Brahman who has the authority to sanction (pra vadati), as it were, the performance of the various sacrificial rites * We often find, for jostance, that, when the Adhvaryu announces that he would start a particular rits, the Brahman is required to acquiesce before the Adhvaryu actually starts that site Incidentally, in

view of the comparative lateness of this hymn (to which a reference has already been made ), such specification of the duties of the four principal priests of the Vedic ritual may not be regarded as anachronistic, It is quite understandable that Agastya should have recommended Vasistha to the Pratşds in such glow ing terms, for, Vasiştha, though a seer of the Rgveda, has been traditionally recognised as a master of Atharvanic practices, and, therefore, as being best qualified to officiate as Brahman and Purobita,35

<h2 id="varuna-vasistha-and-bhakti">VARUNA, VASISTHA, AND BHAKTI</h2>
<p>The sage Vasistha has played a very significant role in the cultural history of ancient India. There is, indeed, hardly any period of the Vedic and the Epic ages on which Vasiştha and his family have not left the special stamp of their almost inimitable personality. Even if one restricted oneself to the copsideration of the period of the Rgveda, one would not fail to be struck by the remarkable contribution made by Vasistha and the Vasişthas, particularly to the socio-political and religious aspects of the culture of that period. As the Purobita of Sudās Bharata, Vasiştha was vitally javolved in the &ldquo;battle of the ten kings &ldquo;, victory in which ultimately gave Sudās supremacy over the entire contemporary Aryandom. But Vasiştha&rsquo;s contribution to the religion of the Rgveda was perhaps of a far greater consequence. It is well known that, at a certain stage in the evolution of Vedic religion and mythology, there inevitably developed a kind of conflict between the older Varuna-cult and the newer Indra-cult. The credit for bringing about a compromise between these two cults and thereby avertiog a schism in the Vedic community largely belongs to Vasiştha. The group of hymns in the seventh mandala relating to Indrāvaruņau ( 82-85) bear ample testimony</p>
<ol>
<li>Vasinha&rsquo;s important role in the Rgvedic period is quite patent. Among other things, his divinc origin and double birth are specially celebrated (VII, 33). (See“ The two births of Vasiştha &quot; published elsewhere in this volume.) As for the Atharvoorda, Vasstha was an expert in Atharvanic practices and was, therefore, regarded as being specially qualified to officiate as Purohita. In the ritual of the Bräknanas, the office of Brahman was usually assigned to a Vasiştha. Like most of the other Rgvedic seers, Vassfha too was not prominent in the Upanisadic period presumably because the Upanigadic idcology developed in a mileu different from that of the Sathhitds and the Brahmapas. A well-known Dharmasūtra 13 ascribed to Vasıątha, Io the two Epics and the Puranas, Vasıştha is often represented as a major character.</li>
<li>Sce“ The Dasarājña&rdquo; published elsewhere in this volume.&rsquo; A reference Tay also be made in this connection to the conflict between the families of Vasięgha and Viśvāmitra, which arose primarily out of a pricstly rivalry but which later had serious socio historical repercussions.

to this. In these hymns, Vasistha has sought to demonstrate that Varuna and Iudra were not antagonistic to each other but that they were essentially complementary,3 “Indra conquers and Varuna rules » &ndash; this slogan, which symbolised Vasistha&rsquo;s attitude in this regard, reflects an integrated socio-political and religious ideal.
The other contribution of Vasistha in the field of religion is important from the point of view of the history not only of the Vedic religion but also of the early Indian religion as a whole. The earliest unmistakable literary traces of the doctrine of bhakti are to be found in the seventh mandala of the Rgveda, particularly in the group of hymns relating to Varuna (86-89). It is now hardly necessary to examine at any length the long out-dated theory regarding the doctrine of bhaktı having been originally borrowed from some non-Indian sources Suffice it to say that the peculiar relationship between Varuna and Vasistba, as represented in the Varuna-hymns of the seventh mandala of the Rgveda, shows most of the essential characteristics of the classical doctrine of bha kti-though by no meaas in any rational order or systematic form
One of the basic characteristics of bhaktı is, on the one hand, the realisation by the devotee or the bhakta of the vast distance which separates him from God - of the unsurpassable greate ness of God as against his own humble position - and, on the other, the inner urge on the part of the bhakta to establish a kind of personal communion with God notwithstanding that distance. This feature of bhaktı may be said to have been very well brought out in the first two stanzas of VII. 86. A cursory perusal of VII 86 tends to create the impression that the first stanza in that hymn, which glorifies the cosmic majesty and activity of Varuna, is, on the face of it, not quite in consonance with the other stanzas which are of an essentially personal character. Again the word tu in the very first pāda of the first</li>

staoza: strikes one as being rather out of place. Here there is no preceding clause with which that tu may be connected as an adversative particle. On the other hand, to regard it either as an emphatic particle or as a mere expletive vould be tantamount to adopting the maxim : sthitasya gatiś cintanijā. The first stanza in this sūkta thus gives the impression of occurring rather abruptly. Similar is the case with the second stanza. The word uta in the first pāda of that stanza&rsquo; does not seem to connect that stanza logically with the preceding one and there fore appears to be just hanging in the air, I would, however, suggest that the first two stanzas of VII, 86 give expression, in a very telling manner, to the continuing initial conflict in the mind of a bhakta. Vasistha, as a true thakta, had been entertaining the hope of being able to establish a personal communion with his special divinity (ista-devată) Varuna. This, indeed, represents the most earnest longing of a bhakta in respect of his God. “But (tu),&rdquo; Vasiştha feared, a wide gulf separated him from Varuna, for, Varuna was so great that, &quot; through his cosmic majesty (mahınā), the creatures (janīrsı) become stabilised (dhiră )$-(of Varuna) who props asunder the two worlds, even though they are enormous” (VII. 86. jab).84 “And yet (uta),&rdquo; Vasistha continued to assert, “I persist in conferring with myself as to when (and how I may be within the innermost presence (Larune antar ) of Varuna&rdquo; (VII.&lsquo;86, 2ab ).88 So understood, the first stanza of VII. 86 is not only not inconsistent with the</li>

second, but it actually provides the very necessary conceptual background for the train of thoughts in the second and subse quent stanzas e Indeed, the starting point of bhaktı may be said to be this overcoming of the sense of the distance between God and the devotee by means of the unextinguishable desire of the devotee to win a kind of sāyujyatā with God 10
But it was not only this natural and inevitable difference between the cosmic majesty of Varuna and the earthly and morta&quot; insignificance of Vasistha that hept the two apart Vasistha was also deeply conscious of his moral ineligibility for a communion with Varuna He knew that he was a sinner - the wise ones whom he approached unanimously told bim that Varuna disliked him on that account ( VII 86 3) This feeling of moral guilt (enah in 86 34, ägah in 86 4a) on the part of a bhakta is another basic factor of the doctrine of bhakti Vasistha&rsquo;s manifold reaction to his acknowledged sinfulness is beautifully manifested in the Varuna hymns, many passages in which remind one of the classical tracts dealing with the relationship between God and the devotee. To begin with, Vasistha tried to explain away his sins In a stanza (VII 86 6 ) 104 which gives one of the finest expressions to a sinner&rsquo;s psychology, Vasistha argued that it was not his own free will (syah daksah) which was at the bottom of his moral lapses - his actions were by no means deliberate

(acilih). It was, verily, on account of destiny (dhrutil jul or passion (manyuh) or evil influence (asti jjāyān kanizasa upāre) that be became a singer. Elsew here in this group of hymus (VII. 89.5) also, Vasiştha prays to Varuņa that, since he might have transgressed Varuna&rsquo;s laws but unknowiogly (acilija-on account of the poverty of will-power (kratrah dinala: VII. 89.3) Varuņa should not punish him for that sin (mā nas tasmad enaso dera ririşah).
But there were also certain factors which should atone for Vasistha&rsquo;s sins. For one thing, Vasiştha nov sincerely repented for his sias. The drstānta of pasutrp tāyu (VII. $6.30) is clearly suggestive of this. Just as a thief (täyu), who had stolen cattle</li>
<li>The word dhruti, which occurs in the Rgpeda only in this passage, is usually derived from the root dhor ( to tempt&quot; &ldquo;to scduce&rdquo;); dhult is then understood to mean &ldquo;seduction&rdquo;. But the idea of scduction is suggested by VII. 86.6c ( asti pyījän toisasa upare). (See the following foot-note. ) GELDNER (De Rig Veda II, 257), who connects this passage with VII. 60.9 (varnadhrulah), translates the word dhruts with Verfehlung (gegen Varupas Gebote). GELDNER construcs : dhruthi suah daksah na (the transgression of your law is not of my own frec will). However, Sāyana seems to have hit the mark by deriving the word from the root dhru (galisthairyayoh ) and explaining it as sthird utpetsamaya ca nirmita daivagalb; (cf, the word dhra.) Vasiştha argues that cvery person is a slave of bis fate or destiny. It may be incidentally pointed out that the word artha in Bhiqma&rsquo;s repeated pronouncement, arthasya puruso dasah (MBh 6. 41. 36a, 51a, 669, 77a), also mcans destiny (from the root; fixed destination) and not &ldquo;noacy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Wealth&rdquo; (as is usually understood ). This latter is a secondary scasc. Bhima does aot want to suggest that he is serving the wrong party because Duryo dhana is &ldquo;paying&rdquo; him; he is, indeed, only emphasizing the omnipotence of destiny (which is a major motif in Indian cpics). The word artha has been uscd io the sense of&quot; destination &quot; &quot; goal&quot; in VII. 18. 9a.</li>
<li>Sāyana understands Dyayan in this passage to mean God (Varuna ?). God as the controller (upore upagals samipe niyant;tvena sthitah) makes a person to act in a particular way. Sāyaṇa quotes : esa hy eva &lsquo;sadhu karma karayoli tarts yam adho minişate (Kaus-Up. 3.8). The passage would rather mean: A senior person gydan) 15 (always there to mislead (updre : dat. inf.) the juniors (karijasah). Or: A senior person is (often) involved (ast) in the scduction (upare : loc. sing.) of the junior.</li>
<li>Vasiştha also pleads that he is but a &lsquo;hunan (manus34) and therefore taşıly prone to err. Cf. VII, 89,5 : yat kur ce &lsquo;dath sarupa daide jane &ldquo;Shidrohar manusyas cardmasi / acilli yol taza dhama yuyopima mi nas tasmad naso deva ririsan.

(pasutrp) but who eventually repented and admitted his crime, was released, so too did Vasistha, who had sinned but later repented for his sins, expect to be released (ava sri) 1* Far more pertinent, however, was the fact that Vasistha wanted to surrender himself completely to the mercy of Varuna ( VIT 86 40 ava tia &lsquo;nena namasa tura ijam. The root 1 with ara, accom panied by namasā, clearly conveys the sense of such surrender A similar sense seems to be suggested by aram karanı (VII. 86 7a) At the same time, Vasistha often emphasised his solemn resolve to free himself from all traces of sin He said that he would surrender to Varuna freed from all sins (anenah VII 86 4 )- that he would attend upon Varuna without any trace of moral guilt (anāgah VII 86 7) This sincere keenness for moral improvement is yet another essential characteristic of a bhakta But, above all, Vasistha had great faith in Varuna&rsquo;s compassion - he knew that Varuna showed mercy even to 2 perpetrator of sins (VII 87 79 yo mrlayatı cakruse cid ägan) He, therefore, earnestly besought the yaksın Varuna not to make him suffer for his sins (VII 88 60 må ta enasyanto yaksın bhujema He, however, never failed to repeat that he did not want to press himself on Varuna while he was under the shadow of the feeling of moral guilt that he wanted to submit himself

The personal relationship which Vasiştha claimed with Varuna unmistałably reminds one of the classical relationship between a blakla and God. Vasiştha called himself a friend, sakhā, of Varuna (VII. 86.49) - a friend, even though he might have sioned against Varuna (VII. 88. 66; frām ägāmsi krnaval sakhā te). He was, indeed. Varuna&rsquo;s constant kinsman, ever dear to him ( VII. 88.64: āpır nityah priyah).14 He would also serve Varuna like a slave or dāsa (VII. 86. 74).18 The drsțânta in VII. 86. 5d (srjā vatsan na damno vasistham) suggests yet another aspect of the relationship between Varuna and Vasiştha - Vasiştha was like a tethered calf ever longing to be united with the mother-cow.
Another significant feature of the classical bhakta-God. relationship, which may be referred to in this very context, is the estrangement which sometimes occurs after God and the devotee have enjoyed a fairly long spell of personal friendship, Vasistha too was not a stradger to this experience. &ldquo;Where has that well-known friendship of ours gone,&rdquo; he once asked in great anguish, “when, in the past, we used to be associated with each other without any guile ? &quot; 14 The dialogue between Varuna and Atharvan in the Atharlaveda (V. 11)-and Atharvan in this context is presumably none other than Vasistha himself1? — also</li>

presupposes some such estrangement, perhaps of a more serious nature 17a
The God involved in bhakti is always a personal God - a true bhakta is, indeed, often vouchsafed a direct vision of this personal God The pure and most agreeable prayer which Vasistha prof. fered unto Varuna (VII 88 lab) turned the worshipful Varuna towards him 18 Vasistha thus came within the direct sight of Varuna, and, whenever later he worshipped Agni, he looked upon the face of Agni as the face of Varuna 19 In other words, Agni, who was always easily visible, served as the medium through which Vasistha could visualise Varuna and meditate upon him Vasistha also seems to have enjoyed the privilege of being a fre quent visitor to Varuna&rsquo;s thousand-doored palace (VII 88 5cm) Like a true bhakta, Vasistha was further privileged to share in some mystic experiences in the company of Varuna “ When we two, Varuna (and myself),&rdquo; Vasistha reminisced on one occasion, “climb into the boat, when we steer forth to the midst of the ocean, when we sail upon the back of the waters - then do we swing on a swing, for glory&quot; (VII 88 3 ) 20 On another occasion, Varuna is said to have presented before Vasistha the cosmic mystery of light and darkness (VII 88. 2cd) The doctrine of grace is vitally related to the classical doctrine of

bhakti. Varuņa too is known to have showed special grace to Vasistha. But that grace was of a different type from the classical one. Varuna initiated Vasistha into the secret of the threefold seven names of the &ldquo;cow” (VII. 87.4). Elsewhere (AV V. 11) Varuna is described as having bestowed upon Atharvan (Vasiştha) the gift of peśni or the cow, which symbo lised the magically potent jāk or speech. As a matter of fact, Vasistha became a Rşi as the result of Varuna&rsquo;s special grace (VII. 88.46: rşin cakāra svapā mahobhih).
Most of the essential features of the classical doctrine of bhakti are thus clearly anticipated in the hymas addressed to Varuņa by Vasiştha ( VII. 86–89). As in the classical representa tion of bhakti, the refrain of Vasistha&rsquo;s utterances also may be said to be, on the one hand, the reiteration of his own moral ineptitude and suffering, and, on the other, his constant and repeated prayer for Varuna&rsquo;s mercy: mila sukṣatra mrlaya. 23

VASISTHA AS RELIGIOUS CONCILIATOR
The seventh mandala of the Rgveda is important from various points of view, such as those of the personality of its author Vasstha, the socio political history of the Vedic period, and the evolution of the Vedic religion and mythology So far as this last point of view is concerned, two things strike us most, namely, (1) that the essential elements of the classical doctrine of bhaktı are more or less clearly adumbrated in the hymns in that mandala relating to Varuna (VII 86-89 ) and (2) that Vasistha seems to have made special efforts to bring about a kind of compromise between the ancient Varuna-cult and the new Indra-cult 2 A critical study of the hymos relating to the dual divinity Indrāvarunau (VII 82-85)- and more particularly of the passages examined below – would afford ample evidence in this regard Vasistha may be said to have originally professed special loyalty to what may be called the Varuna cult — the seventh mandala reflects Vasistha&rsquo;s partiality for Varuna in various ways However, when, in the course of the evolution of the Vedic religion and mythology, the Indra cult became the dominant faith and when, consequently, a conflict between the Varuna cult ard the Indra cult became imminent, Vasistha exhibited a very practi cal and realistic attitude and deliberately sought to co ordinate and harmonize the two religious cults
It may be pointed out that there are in the Rgveda eight whole hymas and parts of two hymns which are devoted to the glorification of the dual divinity Indravarunau, but all of them, except the four hymns in the seventh mandala, are more or less conventional in character The four hymns in the seventh

mandala, on the other hand, are highly significant in that they throw much helpful light on the relationship between the two gods. A deliberate effort seems to have been made by Vasiştha to emphasize that the spheres of activity of Varuna and Indra, though separate, were essentially complementary, and that the two gods were not only not antagonistic to each other but the fully integrated functioning and furtherance of life - cosmic and social - depended on their collaboration on equal terms. These hymns presumably presuppose a copiict between the ancient Varuņa-cult and the new Indra-cult and transparently reflect the sagacious lead given by Vasiştha in the matter of averting the schism which must have threatened the Vedic Aryan comm
The following passages are particularly illuminating in this context :
(1) VII. 82. 2a : saṁrāļ anyaḥ svarā! anya ucyate vām. Of the two gods Indra and Varuna, one, namely Varuda, is called sanrāj, while the other, namely Indra, is called svarāj. This is, indeed, very significant and throws considerable light on the evolution of the Vedic mythology and religion. Indra was originally a human hero who led the Vedic Aryan tribes in their victorious march towards Saptasindhu Id course of time, history was transformed into mythology and the human hero into the national war-god. Indra had thus won his divine sovereignty (raj) through his own (sva) prowess and exploits - in other words, he was sya-rāj. As against this, Varuņa was conceived of as the world-sovereign-san-rāj- even in his original character. He represented an important stage in what may be called the cosmic aspect of the Vedic mythology. It was the vastness, brilliance, and bounty of nature which had first struck the religious imagination of the early ancestors of the Vedic Aryans, They mythologised this their impression in the form of the cosmic parents Dyāvāpsthivi.

Dyavāprthivi was, however, arrested in the Vedic mythology, presumably because the Vedic poet priests soon tended to empha Size another aspect of the world phenomenon, namely, that tha universe, though vast, was not an unregulated orderless chaos but that it was governed by a subtly working all comprehending law This cosmic law was called Rta and its mighty adminis trator was Varuna Through his asuric power, Varuna became samraj — world sovereign — and established law and order 10 this enormous universe ca Vasistha had duly recognized this historical process of the evolution of the Vedic mythology, which incidentally, was determined by the vicissitudes in the cultural life of the Vedic people As was but to be expected the human heroic aspect of the Vedic mythology represented by Indra succeeded the cosmic ethical aspect represented by Varuna But as Vasistha seems to suggest in the passage under consideration this fact must be viewed in its proper historical perspective so that it would effectively counteract any idea of antagonism between the two gods Both gods are great (mahantau 2b) 10 their respective roles All other gods have conceded this, and so, in the highest heaven, they subserve Varuna and Indra by consigoing into them (sam dadhuh) their splendour and their glory 6

(kşemasya ). But, with a view to eliminating even a remote possibility of a dichotomy between the two gods being suggested by such hard and fast allocation of functions, Vasistha seems to have deliberately used the word yurām iostead of yurayoli anyam. Presumably, he wanted to emphasize that the two gods did not work in their respective spheres independently of each other but that both of them collaborated with each other in both the spheres. It will be seen that, in conformity with the changed conditions of the life of the Vedic people, Varuna&rsquo;s role as ad ministrator of the cosmic law was modified so as to be related to the socio-political context. It was suggested that, even after the rise of the Indra-cult, Varuna&rsquo;s role in the Vedic religion had by no means been rendered nugatory. For, Varuna was believed to have been responsible for law and order pot only in the cosmic sense but also in the socio-ethical sense. Human life has two main aspects — the yoga-aspect (creation or acquisition of thiogs which one did not possess and command ), which is denoted by .the words yutsu and pitanāsu in the first pāda, and the hşema aspect (preservation and sustenance of what one already had or has later created or acquired) and lodra and Varuna preside over these two aspects respectively.
Io the third pada of VII. 82.4, Indra and Varuņa are said to be the lords of both kinds of wealth (isänä vasıa ubhayasya). The word ubhayasya is variously interpreted as meaning heavenly (divya) and earthly (pārthia) or divine (daira) and human (mânuşa) or belonging to one&rsquo;s side and belonging to the enemy. In the present context, however, I am tempted to relate that word to the concepts of joga and kşema mentioned in the first two pādas. It is again worth noticing that, for the same reason for which the word yuvām is used for yurayo! anyam, both the gods</li>

As a matter of fact, the interpreta tion of yujām as yuvayoh anyar, suggested in connection with VII. 82. 4 ab, is confirmed by this passage, For, here, Varun directly connected with the ksema-aspect, and the word anyar (obviously referring to Indra) is actually used in the fourth pāda. As in the preceding passage, the yoga-aspect is here jndirectly suggested by the words subham iyale “goes out to win glory.&quot; Indra is not mentioned by name, but is denoted by the epithet ugra ‘formidable&rsquo;as also by the mention of his war-associates Maruts. And, as if to maintain a proper balance, the poet also mentions Varuna&rsquo;s associate Mitra in the third päda. Mitra is said to subserve ( duvasyati Varuna by implementing the latters mandates in connection with h sema.

One of them, namely Varuna, manifests his prowess for the sake of the great prize or reward (mahe Sulkāya ), and the other, namely Indra, for the sake of vehemence (tvise) It is obvious

that tvis is indicative of warlike activities, while the &ldquo;great prize&rdquo; is indicative of post-victory security, order, and peace.10
The real difficulty is about varunasya. It is suggested11 that varunasya is to be connected with both Sulkāya and tvise. Varuna is really the god of both war and peace; and, in tbese two spheres, he operates through his two subordinate associates, Indra and Mitra. In order to promote the peace-activities (mahe Sulkāya) and the war-activities (tvise) of the supreme ruler Varuna, Mitra and Indrala manifest their respective special prowesses. There can be hardly any doubt that Vasistha was originally a great champion of the Varuna-cult. As such, it should not be surprising if he regarded Varuna as the supreme god and Indra, like Mitra,13 as his subordinate associate, But, in the present context, Vasistha specifically wants to establish a kind of co-ordination or compromise, on equal terms, between Varuna and Indra. So it would not be proper to connect varunasya with both sulkāya and tvise. Sayara seems to be right when, with reference to varunasya, he says : upalaksanam etat. Varunasya implies both varunasya (mahe sulkāya) and indrasya (to be supplied : Ivise). In the case of Varuna (varunasya ), for the sake of the great prize, and of Indra, for the sake of vehemence, each of the two gods manifests his own special prowess.14

One of the two gods, namely Varuna, lias stopped or checked (i atirat) the stranger (ajāmım) who had approached with the intention of killing (snathayantam ) That is to say, Varuņa pursuaded those who had originally entertained hostile feeling with reference to the community of the Vedic Aryans to get over that feeling - Varuna tried to create an atmosphere of peaceful understanding between the Aryans and the &ldquo;strangers&rdquo;. This was, indeed, an important aspect of Varuna&rsquo;s responsibility as the upliolder of law and order The third pāda cannot be properly interpreted as One of them (Varuna ) has laid low the enemy who strikes a blow 15 For one thing, with such an inter pretation, there will not be any essential difference between the activity indicated by the third pada and that indicated by the fourth, and the contrast intended to be suggested by the use of anyah anjah will not be brought out It may also be pointed out that the word ajamı does not depote an enemy in general at least not in the present context, ut rather means &ldquo;one who is originally a stranger to the community but who may be ultimately prevailed upon to become socially adjusted to the community&rdquo; 10 Similarly, a atirat is not so strong a word as to yield the sense “has laıd low&quot;. Further it needs to be remembered that Varuna&rsquo;s special character was not that of an overpowering conqueror - Varuna was concerned more or less exclusively with the establishment of peace and good will not only within the Vedic Aryan community but also between the Vedic community and those who were strangers to that community but who might, for one reason or another, be acceptable to the community Accordingly, the third pada cannot be regarded as referring to a warlıke situation, it rather refers to a situation of social tensions and adjustment

It may be here added that, though the concept of bondage underlies the entire Varuna-Řta mythological complex, that concept is represented with a different emphasis in connection with the different members of the Varuga-circle: Varuņa binds down the vast universe and thereby makes the cosmic Rta opera tive; Mitra unites the people, mostly belonging to the Vedic community, through the bond of friendly contract; and Aryaman&rsquo;s function is to bring together the Aryans and the &ldquo;strangers ” by means of hospitality and good will. It is this last activity which is intended in the present context. It is well known that Mitra and Aryaman, like other Adityas, are regarded merely as different aspects of Varuņa and that their special functions are often attributed to Varuna himself.17 The fourth pāda obviously refers to Indra who successfully wards off (pra vrnoti) or fights away many foes (bhūyasan) with the assistance of but a few associates (dablireblih )18
Incidentally, it is perhaps significant that in the last stanza of this hymn (VII, 82), besides Indra and Varuna, Mitra (who is referred to in Sc) and Aryaman (whose activity is intended in 6c) are also mentioned,19

He does not brook even the slightest remissness. But Varuna&rsquo;s law operates in a subtle manner, while men are temperamentally
sposed to various forms of seduction22 and are, therefore, liable to sin against that law, albeit unconsciously. The poet, therefore, prays that. under such circumstances, Varuna&rsquo;s ill will and displeasure (helak ) may not overtake (parivrjyah) them.23

Tai denotes the entity which is the highest one (paramam), and which is hidded or secret or esoteric (guhā), that is to say, which is beyond the comprehension of ordinary men.14 In other words, tat stands for the ultimate philosophical reality.15 Only a “seer&rdquo; (Vena) can have a true knowledge of it; indeed, Vena does not only &ldquo;koow&rdquo; it in an indirect manner, but he &ldquo;sees&rdquo; it, that is to say, he has a direct intuitive perception or realisation of this ultimate reality.18 The use of the words, vena and paśyat, is thus very significant from the point of view of the real objective of Indian philosophy which is not merely indirect knowledge but direct experience or realisation.
Now this ultimate reality, which is the same thing as the prime cause of the universe, is described as that in which the universe becomes of one form. Here we find the later Upanisadic doctrine in its germinal form. In the Upanisads, the first cause is said to be one, uniform, and subtle, but its effect in the form of the universe to be many, manifold, and gross.12 Essentially, the universe is but a fiction of names and forms,18 it is not different from the ultimate reality. What transitorily appears as visa ( many, manifold, gross ) is, before it issues forth from the one cause (at the so-called creation), and also becomes, after it is absorbed into the one cause (at the so-called dissolution), ekarūpa (one, uniform, subtle ),19 The paraman guha, wbich Vena “sees” thus clearly reminds us of the Upanişadic brahman or sat. The doctrine set forth in the first half of AV II. 1. 1 is seen to have been further elaborated in the Upanişads.

If in the second quarter of AV II. 1. 1 we find the Upanişadıc doctrine of sat (or brahman) and jagat in its germinal form, in the third quarter we find the classical Sãókhya doctrine of prakril in its germinal form. Prśni is here said to have produced (aduhat), on the one hand, idam, and on the other jāyamanah The word prsni usually means &ldquo;spotted one,&rdquo; &quot; one of variegated colour,&ldquo;30 The Sankhya praksli, which represents the state of equipoise of the three gunas &ndash; sattva, rajas, and tamas-, is often described as being of three colours - white, red, and black respectively corresponding with the three gunas. One may recall, in this context, the she-goat (ajā), of the Svetāśvatara-Upanisad, which is red-white-black.21 This she-goat also is suggestive of the Sānkhya prakrt1.22 While, in AV II. 1. 1c, the concept of the Sānkhya prakrti is visualised in the form of a cow (?) of varlega. ted colour, in the Upanisad, it is visualised in the form of a red white-black she-goat. Peśni (= mūlaprakrti) produced idan, that is, the material world, on the one hand, and jāyamānāḥ of generations of the human race, on the other. It will be seen that, according to this interpretation, aduhar is understood to mean &quot; yielded by way of milk&rdquo;,&ldquo;produced.” Just as a cow (prśni) yields or produces milk, so too prśni (mülaprakrti) yields or produces idam and jāyamănăh. WEBER23 seems to understand duh in the sense of sto milk” and not of “to yield milk.&quot;** According to him, Prśni is the &quot; milker&rdquo; and not the &ldquo;yielder of milk.” He so construes the quarter that it means that Prśoi milked out jāyamnānäh from idam (Prśni correspondiog to the

milker, idam to cow, and jāyamānal to the milk). Further, according to WEBER, idam stands for tat paramani gultā in the first half of the stanza. GRIFFITH follows WEBER. It would, however, be strange if one and the same entity was referred to as lat in the first half of the stanza and as idam in the second, without any special reason. Similarly, if, as suggested above, tat implied the one ultimate cause (the Upanisadic brahman), it would not be convincing to posit by its side any other entity of equal status like Pęśni which was supposed to have extracted the beings (jājamānah) out of that tal. Further, when the word prsni clearly denoted a cow, it would not be appropriate if it was made to mean a &ldquo;milker,&rdquo; Attention may also be incidentally drawn to the impropriety of a peuter word idam being made to suggest something which is milked from rather than something which is milked out.
This whole incongruity has arisen on account of the attempt made by WEBER and others to combine the two halves of this stanza syntactically as well as ideologically. As a matter of fact, two distinct doctrines have been adumbrated in this stanza &ndash; tho Upanisadic doctrine of brahman in the second pāda and the classical Sankhya doctrine of prakrtı in the third pāda. The word idam in the third pāda need not be connected syntactically with the word fat in the first pāda; actually it implies something which is quite different from what is implied by tat. In the present context, idam (this) may be best interpreted as &ldquo;this that we sce round about us,&rdquo; that is to say, the world, particularly the material world.

(Tem. acc. pl.) and then connect this jāyamānā with the sub stantive prsnih.si It is further suggested that the clause might then be made to mean that Prśni, who was born (of fat or brahnian), on her part, produced idam (jagat). In other words, Peśni is to be understood as the creative power32 (or mājā) of tat-a kind of Demiurge who operates on behalf of iar which by its very nature is not prone to any action. Pęśni is accordingly supposed to play the role of Isvara. Such an inter pretation may fit in with the Vedāntic theory of creation, but we would hesitate to accept it in the present context. And this, for the following reasons. Firstly, the emendation of jāyamānāḥ into jāyamāna is quite unwarranted. Secondly, the word jāyamānā literally means “ being born&quot;, and this meaning will not suit the suggested interpretation. For, Pršni cannot be thought of as “having produced” (aduhat) something while she herself is * being born.&quot; On the other hand, jāyanānal in the sense of &ldquo;those that are being bora&rdquo; would suggest the continuous process of the birth of generations of human beings. It may also be added that, from the strict Vedāntic point of view, īśvara or mājā is not &quot; born” of the brahman. It is, therefore, more reasonable to vaderstand jāyamanah in the sense of prajah and as the second object of aduhat,33
The fourth pâda of this stanza refers to the fact that hosts of beings, who discovered light for the first time (that is to say, who were afforded the opportunity of being born ), shouted in joy at this great wonder of creation.31

<p>ATHARVAVEDA III. 4 : &ldquo;ELECTION OF A KING&rdquo;
Introduction
It is usually suggested that the ancient Indian thinker possessed only a &lsquo;theological&rsquo; and &lsquo;philosophical&rsquo; mind. The large amount of ancient Indian literature relating, either directly or indirectly, to political science (Arthaśāstra or Dandaniti) would, however, clearly indicate that he also possessed what may be called a political&rsquo; and &lsquo;economic&rsquo; mind. Indeed, some of the thinkers of ancient India went to the extent of claiming that Arthaśāstra or Dandaniti was the most fundamental of all sciences,
One of the most basic concepts in ancient Indian polity was that of kingsbip. In the Vedic literature - more particularly, in the Brahmanas - we come across various speculations, mostly embodied in mythical legends, about such topics as the origin and nature of kingship, the functions of the king, the types of sovereignty, and the checks on the autocracy of the king. So far as the origin of kingship is concerned, one may distinguish between two main currents of thought. It is pointed out in one of the Brahmana passages that the highest god (Prajāpati) bestowed his own special power upon one of the gods (Indra) and thus enabled him, though a jupior, to rule over the gods. There is another significapt variation of this theory of the divine origin of kingship. The Mahābhārata, for instance, speaks of a Mare di nature irom Wrich Prajapati rescued Ype &lsquo;auman race by laying down a code of conduct for all people and by creating the institution of kingship,3 The Great Epic here refers to three</p>

distinct stages in the process of the evolution of kingship, namely, (a) the golden age of stateless&rsquo; society, in which there was &lsquo;neither kingship nor king, neither sceptre nor the bearer of the sceptre&rsquo; and in which all people protected one another by means of righteous conduct on the part of each one of them ), (b) the period of decadence characterised by the prevalence of a state of nature 5 and (c) the divine origination of law and the adminis trator of las (that is, the king) 6 The Satapatha-Brahmana also seems to hint at a similar origin of law and kingship?
It may be incidentally mentioned here that in the Vedic literature there are but very rare references to any divinity attaching to the person of a historical hing In RV IV 42 9, king Trasadisyu is called ardha-dera (half-god ), and, in AV XX 127 7, Pariksit is referred to as a god who is abole mortals. The idea of the personality of a king having becu constituted of essential particles derived from different gods was de cloped, perhaps for the first time, in the Alamısmrti.
ATHARVAVIDA III 4: &ldquo;ELECTION OF A KING&rdquo;
143
Three main points need to be noted in connection with the second current of thought relating to the origin of kingship. Firstly, the need for kingship was felt on account of special emer gency such as that of war, secondly, kingship was the result of some kind of election, and, thirdly, the king was expected to fulfil certain obligations to the people in this theory, which may be described as the theory of the elective origin of kingship, two principles were thus involved - one of election and the other of implied social contract
Atharvaveda III 4 contains quite an upambiguous reference to the Vedic practice of the election of a king 10 It does not form part of any mythical legend, but presumably describes actual historical conditions It would seem that the king was elected not by the whole community, but by a smaller body which constituted what may be called the electoral college. This hymn is important also for some other ideas concerning polity which occur in it

VIII 12 gives another version of the theory of the elective origin of kingship That passage is further important for the different types of state which it mentions ($nraya bhauja, suardiya, patroja etc) and for the formulas used for the proclamation of Indra s elect on to sovereignty (eg dharmasya gopta ajanı)

[1. I read manusyah (sing). A king was Indra in human form. What Indra was to gods, a king was to the human tribes. It is also possible to understand manusyāh as an adjective (fem. acc. pl.) qualifying a word like višah (to be supplied). The meaning in that case would be: O Indra, Indra! Do thou come hither unto ( these ) human (tribes) (in the form of the newly elected king). 2. A pun on the word saruna is intended also in this context. It would seem that the king was elected not by the whole clan or tribe, but by certain elders of the clan, who constituted the electoral college and who are here referred to as sarunas or electors (cf, sajātäh above). In another sense, Varunas may mean Varuna and other gods, who had made Indra their king. To read rarnaih (= social orders ?) for varunaih is not convincing. 3. = varunah. 4. Two distinct currents of thought seem to have been mixed up in this reference, He=Varunah ( sing. ), that is, God Varuna; or the (personified) electoral college ( see note 2 on st. 5 above). The author of this stanza seems to have in mind the mythological phenomenon of Varuna&rsquo;s flaving made place for Indra as the chief god of the Vedic pantheon in the course of the evolution of Vedic mythology (See: DANDEKAR, &ldquo;Some aspects of Vedic mythology; Evolutio nary mythology,&rdquo; UCR 12, 1-23).

<p>ATHARVAVEDA VII, 12 &ldquo;CHECKS ON MONARCHY : POPULAR ASSEMBLICS
Introduction
Though the normal form of state in ancient India had been monarchy, sufficient care was taken to see that it did not tend to degenerate joto autocracy. The ancient Indian monarch func tioned under various checks - direct or indirect, constitutional or otherwise.
(1) Firstly, it was cmphatically laid down that Dharma (= law) was superior to Kşatra (=sovereign power of the king): Indeed, Dharma was described as the “ Kşatra of Ksatra.&rdquo; A passage in the Brhadāranyaka-Upanişad,1 for instance, sets forth three significant principles of ancient Indian polity, namely, (a) that the society cannot flourish in the absence of any of its four constituents - Brahiman, Ksatra, Vis, and Sūdra, (b) that Brahman or spiritual power is the source of Kşatra or martial power, and (c) that Dharma or law is the ultimate authority in social and political matters. The Upanişad points out that there is nothing higher than Dharma and that Dharma serves as a solid guarantee even for a weaker man against the possible oppression by a stronger man. The absolute supremacy of Dharma thus constitutes one of the most basic concepts of ancient Indian social and political philosophy.
(2) Then there was the Purohita who, as the embodiment of Brabman, functioned as the inevitable mentor of the king not only in spiritual but also in temporal matters. Ailareya-Brahmana VIII. 24-27 asserts that a king is by no means self-sufficient he has to depend on the Purohita for his spiritual and temporal well being and progress. The Purohita is said to possess five formi dable powers. &ldquo;Surrounding the king with these powers (for his protection ) he stands like the sea (surrounding) the earth.</p>

ENORCISCS IN INDOLOGY
The kingdom of (such a) nobic (ruler) becomes inviolable&rdquo; The relation between the Purohita and the king is said to be tantamount to &lsquo;marriage of Brahman and Ksatra The king is described as being &lsquo;femalc&rsquo; to the Purohit? but &lsquo;male&rsquo; to his own rcalm The union of regnum and sacerdotum must, indeed, bc regarded as one of the essential principles of Indian polity
(3) Similarly thc strict and detailed rulcs prescribed in respect of the training and the conduct of the king must have cxcrcised considerablc influence upon the character of monarchy Ancient Indian polity docs not treat specifically of the rights and privileges of the state and the subjects but leaves them to be inferred from the dulics and responsibilities of the king and the citizen with which it deals at some length It would be seen from Lausilija Arthasstra I 19, which deals with the duties of a ling that a definite and cxacting time tablc reculated his activities A king was expected to keep in touch with cicry department of administration Special stress was laid on the inadvisability of his keeping himself isolated from the subjects Arigorous time table such as this one, which governed the day to day life of a king by accounting for almost cvery moment of his saling Jile could have hardly allowed him any scope for developing auto cratic tendencies
(4) The Kausilija Arthasastras further points out that though monarchy was the normal form of state in ancicat ladia, the sovereign power was not concentrated in the person or the office of the monarchi alone The state or soycreignty was regarded as an organic whole made up of seven constitucots ( which were called the angas or limbs of the body politic)-the
CHECKS ON MONARCHY,: POPULAR ASSEMBLIES 151
monarch being just one of those constituents. The state, it is emphasised, could function effectively only if these constituents remained properly integrated with one another. So far as the precautions against a possible autocracy are concerned, attention may be drawn to what Kautilya has to say in the present context, about the perfection of the king,&rsquo; and about the qualities by means of which people are attracted towards him&rsquo; as also his
qualities of intellect, energy, and personality.&rsquo;
(5) Public opinion, expressed through the constitutional changels of popular assemblies like the sabha and the samiti, must also have served as an effective check on ancient Indian monarchy.
Atharvaveda VII. 12 is a charm to procure influence in the sabha and the samill.? Though there is, in the Vedic literature, sufficient indication that the sabla and the samiti were distinct types of popular assemblies, we cannot derive from that literature any clear idea about their specific natures and functions as also about the extent to which they operated as constitutional checks on Vedic monarchy. It is not unlikely that they denoted different kinds of bodies at different times and in different localities.

o Fathers, 4
[1. Many kinds of assemblies seem to have been in vogue in the Vedic period, as is suggested by such words as sabha, samiti, sena, sangrāma, surā, sangati, and vidatha. It cannot, of course, be claimed that these words are used in a technical sense in all the contexts where they occur. As for the sabhā and the samiti, different views have been expressed regarding their natures and functions The samitz is, for instance, said to have been the national assembly of the whole people or višal, with the village forming the basis of its constitution. It is further suggested that the samiti had evolved only in the late Vedic period. According to another view, the samiti was a congregation for purely sacrib cial and religious purposes. However, so far as the early Vedic period is concerned, the samiti seems to have been an assembly of the folk. It is of course not clear whether it had any representa tive character as such or whether it was merely a general gather. ing of the people, and whether it had any statutary constitution or whether it was convened only in an ad hoc manner. There are references in the Veda which suggest that the ruling king attended the meetings of the samiti (rajā na satyah samitir iyānah - RV IX. 92. 6; yatrau &lsquo;sadhih sam agmata rājānah samitāv iva - RV X. 97, 6) (Incidentally, it is doubtful whether the word samih is at all used in the sense of assembly in RV X. 166. 4). It 1 also suggested that the support of the samitt was often regardcu as a considerable source of strength to the king (nā &lsquo;smai santitih kalpale — AV V. 19, 15; dhruvāya te samitih halpatan iha - AV VI. 88 3). But there is no evidence to show that the election of a king was one of the functions of the samiti (cf. DANDEKAR, &quot; Athanaeda III. 4,&rdquo; published elsewhere in this Volume). The sabhā is variously described as an exclusive gathering of a higher order or as a village assembly presided over by grāmani or as an Advisory council of a select few or as the standing committee of
CHECKS ON MONARCHY : POPULAR ASSEMBLIES 153
the samiti. The exact relationship between the sabha and the samiti cannot be ascertained from the Vedic references. It would, however, seem (a) that the sabhā was a smaller and a more exclu sive body, (b) that it met more frequently than the samiti, (c) that it was entrusted with some kind of administration of justice (as implied by the word kilbisasprt in RV X. 71. 10?), and (d) that its decisions were generally binding (see the next stanza). 2. Like kingship, the sabhā and the samuti too were regarded as having been of divine origio. They must have enjoyed great prestige and authority in Vedic polity. 3. that is, help me in my plans; (comm.: upetya siksajalu samicinan rādayatu). 4. The reference is not clear. Does it mean elders or senior members ? A new member is seeking the blessings and cooperation of the elders in his efforts to become influential in the assemblies. The keen desire to prevail in the sabhi and the samiti indicates that the deliberations in these bodies were of great consequence in the public life of the times.)

[1.. To know the name of any entity is to be able to exercise a kind of magical influence over that entity. This is one of the basic concepts of the ideology of the Atharvanic magic and occurs frequently in that Veda. 2. This word is variously inter preted: (a) “that which is agreeable to men&quot; (nar-ista) or &ldquo;that which promotes interchange of talk and ideas among men&rdquo;: it is thus understood to refer to the social&rsquo; rather than to the
political&rsquo; aspect of the function of the sabhi; naristā = sport, mirth (cf. AV XI. 8. 24). (b) The word is also derived from nar and stha (=gathering place for men). (c) This word occurring in Vaj. Sar. 30. 6 is explained as &ldquo;most favourable to men.&rdquo; Cf. (a), (d) naristā is linguistically connected with German Narr: it is thereby implied that the sabhä is usually fickle. (e) But the scholiast is perhaps right in explaining it as na ( = not) - rista

Paipp, reads : veda vai sabhe te nāma subhadra &lsquo;si sarasvati. 3. nāma = verily, indeed, certainly; or = nämnā, by name? Vai is an expletive. 4. The words sabhāsad ( = member of the king&rsquo;s council or of the body of assessors ?) and sabhya ( = member of a general assembly?) are said to be distinct in meaning, but Vedic evidence does not seem to confirm this 5. The anxiety of the speaker to win over the members of the body to his own point of view becomes evident throughout this hymn ]

<p>THE SANVĀDASŪKTA IN THE ATHARVAVEDA
The Samvadasūktas or dialogue-hymns constitutc one of the distinctive features of Rgvedic hymnody. Various views have been put forth by scholars regarding the genesis and nature of these hymns. OLDENBERG, for iastance, speaks of the ancient Akhyānas or narratives made up of prose and verse and suggests that only the verse-portions of some of such narratives, which were perhaps supplemented by extempore prose additions by the narrator, are preserved in the form of the so-called Samvāda sūktas. He, therefore, characterises these hymns as ākhyāda hymns. CHARPENTIER, however, regards these hymns as pieces of epic poetry which do not need any additional prose.* OLDEN BERG&rsquo;s Akhyāna-theory is rejected, among others, by HERTEL and VON SCHROEDER, who look upon these hymns as frag ments of ritual dramas. W. H. RIDGEWAYS who emphasizes the religious origin of drama, HILLEBRANDT, WINDISCH, ind Sylvain LÉVI according to whom the Samvadasūktas are like some sort of rough sketches of drama, support the Vedic drama heory, While accepting the essential dramatic character of the Samvādasūktas and the probability that they presuppose some kind of Drśya entertainment, some scholars have expressed doubt as to their connection with ritual.
There is also the suggestion - which can be hardly accepted - that the Sanvādasūktas are merely the result of the Vedic poets&rsquo;</p>

endeavour for greater literary effect through the exploitation of different speech-forms.10 Recently it has been pointed out that OLDENBERG&rsquo;s Akhyāna-theory is fuodamenatlly sound and that old Ākhyāna-verses are quoted in the Rgveda with a view to putting them to magical use by means of the secondary additions to them of appropriate spells, 11

In the present context, it is not intended, nor is it necessary, to subject these various theories to a critical examination. Suffice it to say that even a casual study of most of the so-called Sam vādasūktas would indicate that those hymns were essentially of the nature of ancient ballads. GELDNER has described them as lyrical poems with epical subject matter and dramatic lay-out.&quot; Like ballads, these hymns are usually made up partly of direct speech, whereby the bard either himself assumes the roles of the different characters in the story which is being depicted and speaks out their speeches presumably with suitably varyiog articulation of rhetorically addresses some of those characters, and partly of narration in the third person. These hymos are further characte rised by such features as repetition, ellipsis, absence of proper sequence of stanzas, impromptu additions, and parenthesis, which are common to oral poetry like ballad. On the basis of their central themes, one may broadly classify these ballads as histo rical, mythical, ritualistic, speculative, etc.
As against the RV which has several Samvādasūktas, the AV contains only one Samvādasūkta. It is the eleventh hymo 10 the fifth Kānda of the Saunaka-Samhitā of that Veda. It is well known that, unlike the RV-Samhitā, authorship is not the criterion which governs the arrangement of the AV-Samhita. AS a matter of fact, in respect of most of the hymns of the Ar, the authorship is indicated by the mention of the class of</li>

· the hymns secms to have been regarded, in many cases, as the norm for the arrangement of the AV-Samhiti. The fifth Kānda is said to belong to the first grand division of the AV. It consists of thirty-one hymns which are made up of 376 stanzas. Accord ing to the Anukramani, the hymns in this Kānda are assumed Bormally to contain eight stanzas each; but actually only two hymns (namely, the ninth and the tenth, which, however, are rather of the nature of pary āj a-sūk tas than artha-sūhtas) are of this normative length
The eleventh hymn in the fifth Kāņda of the AV, which contains eleven stanzas, is constituted of a dialogue between Varuna and Atharvan. Incidentally, the portion of the commen tary (which is traditionally ascribed to the authorship of Sāyana) on this Kānda is not available. As for the ancillary literature, the Vartānasūtra does not quote this hymn at all, while the Kausikasūtra mentions it only once (12.1) in connection with a rite for general welfare. But the viniyoga prescribed in the Kausikasūtra seems to have hardly any relevance to the subject matter of the hymn.
The gist of the hymn is briefly as follows: Varuņa had bestowed upon Atharvan the gift of a cow,15 which he later wanted to revoke. Atharvan, on his part, seeks to propitiate Varuna and to convince him of his being worthy of the gift. Thereupon, Varuna, satisfied with Atharvan&rsquo;s pleading of his case, returos the cow to him, and, to boot, assures him of his eternal friendsbip. It has already been pointed out that Atharvan is not the name of any specific person. It rather stands for a class of priests closely associated with the AV.18 As against this, the</li>

present dialogue, wbich presupposes a specific context, requires a specific person, belonging to the Atharvan class of priests, as a correspondent of Varuna 17 The various indications in and about this hymn point to that person being Maitrāvaruni Vasistha
For one thing, there is the tradition that Vasistha, though a seer of the RV. was well versed in the Atharvadic lore and practices He was, therefore, regarded as being eminently suited for the office of the priest belonging to the AV The Atharvanic priestcraft can be viewed in its two main aspects, namely, ritua listic and socio political It has to be remembered that, in the initial stages, the AV was not included in the sacred Trayi and that the priests of the Yajurveda (the Adhvaryu ), the RV (the Hot), and the Samaveda ( the Udgāts) shared among themselves the entire gamut of a sacrificial performance When, however, the claim of the AV as Brahmaveda18 came to be duly recognized,

a place was made for the priest of that Veda in the scheme of the Vedic ritual. That priest was called Brahman (masc.)29 But, since there had remained no specific ritualistic duty which could be assigned to the Brahman, he was entrusted with the overall supervision and superintendence of the ritual procedure. And it s exactly in this capacity that Agastya urged the Pratşds (that is, the Tștsus) to receive Vasiştha, for, as Agastya emphasized, Vasiştha would &ldquo;support the supporter of Ukthas (the Hotr) and the supporter of Sīmans (the Udgāts), (and he would also support him who) is the supporter of the Soma-crushing stone (the Adhvaryu ), and (he alone) would speak with authority in front of all of them.&rdquo; That the Brahmatva or the Atharvanic ritualistic priestcraft was Vasistha&rsquo;s forte is thus well-established.

This their attitude may be said to have become more aggressive in the course of timc unul they alipost weat to the extremc of claiming the superiority of their Veda to the ohter Vedas. While this attitude had been developing, there was also becoming cvident another current of thought, which was quite independent of the current of thought which had given rise to the attitude mentioned above. It was gradually being realised that, Crom the point of view of the highest knowledge, the Trayl was, after all, limited in scopc. Therefore, a more comprehensive, all inclusive, and even transcendental &ldquo;Inowledge&rdquo; came to be thought of; it was called Brahman. As the Taittiriya-Sarita 7.3.1.4 has stated : parimila pārcah parmitani samani parımılanr sajūty athai &lsquo;stasyai &lsquo;ad into na isti yad brahma. The two above-mentioned currents of thought subscquently coalesced with the result that the aggressive protagonists of the AV claimed that thcir Veda dealt with this limitless Brahman — that it was the Brahmaveda. Cl. Gopatha-Br. 3.4 : clad oai bhayıs thah brahma jad bhrgeanligirasah. On account of this character of the AV, it also came to be known as Jataveda, Jātavidya, or Sarvavidya (that is, &ldquo;the lore of all being&rdquo;). Tor Sarvavidyā, çf. TBr III. 10.11.4.</li>

cularly in the context of the Dasarājña, as the Purohita par excellence.22 The purohiti (or the priestcraft) of the Titsus, whose leader Vaşistha was, is said to have proved most efficacious in that war.23 The Taittiriya-Samhită (IIJ. 5. 2. 1) stresses Vasiştha&rsquo;s pre-eminence in both the aspects of the Atharvanic priestcraft - ritualistic and socio-political - in the following single unequivocal statement: tato vasistha-purolulāh prajāk prājāyanta iasmad väsisiho brahmi kāryah prar &lsquo;va jayate. Vasistha, accord ingly, is the Atharvan: his identity with Atharvan of AV V. 1124 may thus be regarded as being clearly indicated.25
Secondly, the peculiar kind of relationship between Varuna and Atharvan, as envisaged in AV V. 11, would unmistakably remind one of the relationship between Varuna and Vasistha as reflected in the seventh Mandala of the RV, particularly in the group of hymns relating to Varuna ( 86-89). Indeed, as I have suggested elsewhere, Vasistha may be said to have originally professed special loyalty to the Varuna-cult, though, when a conflict between the ancient Varuna-cuit and the new Indra-cult became imminent, he exhibited a very practical and realistic attitude and deliberately sought to co-ordinate and harmonize the two religious cults.28
THE SAMVĀDASŪKTA IN THE ATHARVAVEDA

elements of the classical doctrine of Bhakti are more or less distinctly adumbrated in Vasistha&rsquo;s hymns to Varuna.37 One such element is the close personal relationship - not unoften oscillat ing between love and displeasure, union and estraogement, which fact verily lends to that relationship a fine human touch - which Vasiştha claims with Varuna. And it is exactly this kind of Telationship which is presupposed in the present dialogue between Varuna and Atharyan,
Not only this. Just as Vasiştha looked up to Varuna as bls special god &ndash; as the god with whom he sought to be united in Bhaktize - Varuna too, on his part, made Vasiştha the recipient of his special grace. Indeed, Vasistha owed his very Rşibood to Varuņa&rsquo;s grace.29 This is paraphrased by another statement, which is particularly relevant to our preseat discussion, namely that Varuna initiated Vasistha into the mystery of the threefold seven names of the cow&rsquo; who symbolized the magically potent Vak. Now in view of what has already been said above about Vasistha and Atharvan, there should be hardly any doubt that the initiation of Vasiştha by Varuna into the mystery of the twenty one names of the cow mentioned in RV VII, 87. 4 and the gifting of a cow to Atharvan by Varuna implied in AV V. 11 refer to one and the same episode.

Those words, no doubt, imply a mild reproach. Prśni here symbolises the magically potent vāk. See the introductory remarks, Punarmagha is variously interpreted: (1) ROTH (Ueber den AP, 9) Traaslates it with greedy&rsquo;; (11) punarmagha may mean one who re-bestows a gift upon another, the implication being that he first takes it back from the person upon whom it was originally bestowed; (iii) punarniaghatva is read as one word meaning re-bestowal, and is understood as the object of acikitsih; (iv) Atharvan deliberately uses the epithet in order to praise (flatter) Varuna, anticipating that Varuna would re-bestow the gift upon him alone. In all cases, the underlying idea is that of a revoker of gift. I

[Varuņa continues. It is rather unusual jn a Vedic Sanvāda sūkta that the speech of one and the same speaker extends over three continuous stanzas. Varuna here points out that, if any one could truly claim to be Kavi and Jätavedas, it was he alone. * It is further suggested that, if any one else were to put forth such a claim, it would disturb the order which it was for Varuna, as administrator of the cosmic law Rta, to establish and maintain (note the significance of dharisye).

| Varuna speaks. He replies to Atharvan&rsquo;s query, in the form of a riddle - of a Brahmodya. (c) In view of the context, it is necessary to change varuna (voc. sing.) to varunah (nom. sing.). Varuņa unfolds the cosmogonic mystery to Atharvan, Cf. RV VII. 88.2 cd, where Varuņa is said to have presented before Vasiştha the cosmic mystery of light and darkness. (de) These two Padas, which are in no way connected with Varuna&rsquo;s unfolding of the cosmogonic mystery, may be understood as an impromptu addition made by the bard himself rather than as a part of Varuņa&rsquo;s speech. They, indeed, constitute an interesting poetic device. As suggested in c, Varuna is to be supposed, to have explained to Atharvan Vasiştha, in the fourth and the fifth Padas, the real significance of ab. But, since that knowledge is essentially esoteric, it has to be kept secret from unqualified people. Cf. RV VII. 87. 4 cd : vidvān padasya gulya na vocad yugāya vipra uparāya śikṣan. The space of the two Padas, d and e, which should have contained Varuna&rsquo;s exposition of the mystery, would have, accordingly, to be left blank. But the bard avoids this by inserting these two &ldquo;filler Pādas. They do not belong to the main theme of the dialogue, but are of the nature of popular sayings. It is this kind of material of common vogue and general import - benediction or expres sion of good wishes or imprecation (as in the present case) - which is usually employed by way of a &lsquo;filler&rsquo;. Such fillers (as, in modern parlance, &quot; May God bless you,&rdquo; “God save the King.&quot; &ldquo;Damn it,&rdquo; etc.) are inserted to indicate several things, such as the speaker&rsquo;s wantiog to remember something or his wanting to avoid mentioning something explicitly, etc. We have to imagine that, during the interval when the bard uttered the trite sayings in Padas d and e, Varuna secretly imparted to Atharvan the esoteric &amp;nowledge. The choice of the particular

sayings as fillers&rsquo; is, as will be shown in the sequel, deliberate and significant It is also possible but poctically not at all apropos - to interpret the two Pädas as implying that Vasıştha&rsquo;s obtaining the knowledge of the cosmogonical mystery would result in the downfall of the Panis and the Dasas )

<p>A Survey of the Work of some Western Scholars
In 1805, Henry Thomas COLEBROOKE published his essay, &quot; On the Vedas, or Sacred Writings of the Hindus,'&ldquo;1 and thereby became entitled to the distinction of being perhaps the first Western scholar ever to write at some length about the Veda.&rdquo; In this essay, COLEBROOKE deals with what may be called the * externals&rsquo; of the Vedic literature rather than with its contents. He gives, mainly on the strength of the manuscripts coliccted by himself, the first sketch, in any European language, of the Rgreda (RV) and, to a smaller cxtent, of the other three Vedas. He also speaks of the Vedic rşis, the various Vedic schools, and the Vedic commentaries, and incidentally touches upon the question of the authority of the Veda. He further refers to the Aitareya Brahmana, tre Sarikhāyana-Brīlimana, and the Sarapatha-Brālt mana. From among the Vedangas, hc mentions the Sūtras only in passing, but he emphasises the importance of the Nirukta and evinces special interest in Jyotişa. About the Vedic religion and mythology as such he has hardly anything to say. Whatever information about the Veda COLEBROOKE has given in his essay is generally correct, but his writing also shows that he had not made any deep study of the Veda. Indeed, COLEBROOKE cannot be said to have even formed a proper estimate of the Veda. He says that the Vedas are far too extensive to be trans lated in entirety and that the ancient dialect in which they are written is exceedingly difficult and obscure, and further adds that their contents are such as would render such translation bardly rewarding either to the reader or to the translator, COLEBROOKE&rsquo;s attitude towards the Veda was thus somewhat resigned&rsquo;, and,</p>

accordingly, his essay did not prove particularly conducive to further Vedic research

Friedrich ROSEN was a devoted pupil of BOPP (about whom it is said that he, being himself great in research work, accomplished more through his power of stimulating others than by systematic instruction), and his work Radices Sanscritae
clearly reflected the influence of the master. But ROSEN&rsquo;s true genius was revealed in the bold plan which he had conceived of publishing the entire RV-Samhuta with Latin translation and notes. In 1830, he published his Rig-Vedae Specimen for which he had utilised Yaska, Pūnini, and Sayana. His work on the edition of RI&rsquo; was, however, interrupted by his untimely death, and the part of it, which is now available, was published only posthumously,10 This part contains the text of the first 121 hymns with translation ( which is, to a large cxtent, based on Sāyana&rsquo;s commentary). The exegetical notes cover the portion only up to RV I. 31.6. This edition of RV, sadly incomplete as it bad been, served as the basis of Vedic philology in Europe for a pretty long time. A new branch of Xnowledge was, as it were, taking shape, albeit falteringly, out of this edition. What is, however, significant in the context of the present study is that ROSEN&rsquo;s work affords a few glimpses in what later on developed into comparative mythology. He it was, for instance, who, in connection with the legend of the Panis and the cows, first drew attention to the comparable myth of Cacus and Evander.
Eugène BURNOUF (1801-1852) was essentially a pioneer and pathmaker,&rsquo; and, though he himself wrote little about the Veda, bis lectures on the subject at Paris proved a veritable source of inspiration to his many pupils, among whom may be specially mentioned ROTH, MAX MULLCR, REGNIER, and NEVE,

ROTH&rsquo;s first work, Zur Litteratur und Geschichte des IVeda,&quot; written at the age of twenty-five, is truly epoch-making. Verily it was this monograph which, small as it was, must be said to have inaugurated the era of critical Vedic scholarship. The monograph consists of three sections dealing respectively with the Sanhitā, the Prātsakhya, and the history in RV 1% It would be interesting to compare ROTH&rsquo;s work with that of COLEBROOKE, As against the latter&rsquo;s counsel of despair, for ROTH, the Veda offered a very rich and fertile field for research In his view, for the history of Orient - indeed, for the entire history of anti quity, there was perhaps nothing more important than the study of the Veda ROTH was interested more in the contents of the Veda thad in its form - his work was &lsquo;pbilological&rsquo; rather than linguistic, lexical&rsquo; rather than grammatical He believed that the hymns of RV were not the creation of a theological speculation, nor did they grow out of minute liturgical practice (which, according to him, definitely belonged to a later age). Their language, religion, and cult were more indigenous than those of the subsequent periods. The Indian commentators did not possess a key to these - they were overpowered by prejudice and did not have a sense of historical development. ROTH&rsquo;S slogan, therefore, was: &lsquo;Away from Sāyana&rsquo; He insisted that the RV-exegesis must seek to make the texts yield their own sepse, One must bring together and study comparatively all the passages which are related to one another verbally or from the point of view of contents ROTH further emphasised that RV and the Brahiranas had to direct connection, that there was a considerable gulf between the two.13 Incidentally it may be

Vedic (and, therefore, Indo-European ) gods were personifications of natural powers and phenomena, particularly the meteorological phenomena. In his &ldquo;Zur altesten Geschichte der indogermanis. chen Volker,&ldquo;92 KUHN first applied his comparative study of Indo-European (IE) languages – particularly Vedic, Greek, and Germanic - to the reconstruction of Indo-European antiquity. But his priocipal work in the field of comparative mythology is Die Herabkunft des Feuers und des Gortertranks.23 Here he points to the traces, among the various le peoples, of a common pantheon of gods and a common mythology. These traces he discovers mainly in legends and folk-tales.&rdquo; For this purpose, he has brought together a considerable amount of material, suggesting a large number of etymological equations (which are, however, not always acceptablc) and mythological comparisons. He seems to think of the Vedic mythology not as an Indian&rsquo; mythology, but merely as an aspect of the boundless IE mytho logy. All that the Veda docs for him is to provide materials for comparison. This has resulted in the undue prominence which he has given to such figures as Saranyū and Sārameya, whose counterparts, according to him, may be easily found in Erinys and Hermeias respectively. Uşas reminds him of Brunhild. He identifies Rbhus with Greek Orpheus - even with Germanic Elben - and the Gandharvas with Kentauren. In his above mentioned book, Die Herabkunft des Feuers, KUHN has studied, among others, the legend of Purūravas and Urvasi and of Cyavana from the point of view of comparative mythology. His papers on &quot; Pitars as phenomena of light,&rdquo; &quot; Dwarfs as souls of the dead&rdquo;, and &quot; Dwarfs as phenomena of light &ldquo;are included in the second volume of Mythologische Studien non Adalbert Kuhn.25 In the same volume he has dealt with “Cows in Indogermanic</li>

published in the first volume of his journal, Indische Studien, a paper on the two legends from the Satapatha-Brāhmaṇa, namely, the legend of Manu and the Deluge and the legend of Videgha Mātbava. This latter legend, according to WEBER, clearly referred to the migration of the Vedic Aryans from the region of the river Sarasvati to that of the Sadānīrā in Kosala-Videha. Later, WEBER also dealt with other legends, such as those of the rejuvination of Cyavana, the revengeful requital after death, Vāmadeva&rsquo;s two mares, and Purūravas and Urvašī. Of course, in the course of his profuse writing, WEBER had many occasions to discuss the nature of the Vedic gods. While doing so, he has depended, to a large extent, on the etymologies of the names of these gods. At one place, for instance, he has identified Asvins with the Gemini stars and has added that they were called Nāsatyau because they appeared like nose (or island) in the ocean of the morning sky.' Elsewhere he has accepted the equation, Sárameyau - Kerberos. He has also referred appro vingly to the identification of Dyauş-pitā with Zeus Pater and Jupiter and of Surya with Helios and Sol.
The principal achievement of Theodor AUFRECHT in the field of Vedic studies was that it was he who published the first complete edition of RV 31 This edition, which gave the text transcribed in Roman characters, must be said to have exercised, for a pretty long time, by far the greatest influence on the Vedic studies in Germany. As for the Vedic religion, AUFRECHT believed that Savitr, Varuna, Dyauh, and Vişou were the oldest gods, and that, in RV, the worship of these gods seemed to be superseded by the worship of newer gods.

In the preface to the second volume of his edition, AUFRECIIT gratefully acknowledges the inspiration which he had received for his work from Roses and Ron, A mention may be made here also of AUFRECHY&rsquo;s edition (1879) of the Attareya Brahmana, with
extracts from Sāyana&rsquo;s commentary, glossary, index of verses from RV, and notes.

when AUFRECHT&rsquo;s edition of RV was nearing completion, that is to say, in 1863, Émile BURNOUF, the nephew of Eugène BURNOUF, published his Essai sur le Veda, 32 which as the subtitle indicated, consisted of studies on the religion, literature, and social organization of India from the early times to the brahmanic period. In this book, the younger BURNOUF has dealt, among others, with such topics as the origin of caste, the absence of any hierarchy among the Brāhmanas, the Vedic ritual, and the origin of gods and their symbolic nature.33 His treat ment of the Vedic religion was oriented by comparative linguistics and comparative mythology, but his general approach was essen tially speculative. According to him, the Vedic ritual was but an abridged representation of the grand working of nature. For him, Agni personified the principle of fire as also of life. Many of Émile BURNOUF&rsquo;s ideas about the Vedic religion and mythology seem to have been later adopted and developed by BERGAIGNE.
In the field of Vedic studies, the pame of Friedrich MAX MULLER is celebrated as that of the scholar who gave to the Vedists the Editio Princeps of the RV-Samhita with the commen tary of Sāyana. But MAX MÜLLER must also be regarded as the first scholar who roused genuine interest for the Veda among the generally educated people of the West. He did not write only for the specialists, and yet his expert knowledge of the facts of the Veda invested his writings with a kind of authority. It was while attending E. BURNOUF&rsquo;s lectures in Paris that MAX MÜLLER received the inspiration for the edition of RV with</li>

33 On the ono hand this book served as a complement, and more parucularly as a corrective, to von BOHLEN&rsquo;S Das alle Indien (1830), and, on the other, it found its complement and corrective in 2IWER&rsquo;s Alrindisches Lebm (1079).</li>

Sāyana&rsquo;s commentary. The first volume of this edition was published in 1849 and the last in 1874. As for Vedic exegesis as such, MAX MULLER has not done much except perhaps his English translation of the Hymns to Maruts.35 His main concern seems to have been the religion of the Veda.38 MAX MULLER believed that the true history of mankind was the history of man&rsquo;s religion. And he further believed that from no other source did one understand the origin and development of religion so thoroughly as from the Indian scriptures.s? “While Hesiod gives us,&rdquo; he writes, as it were, the past bistory of a theogony, we see in the Veda the theogony itself, the very birth and growth of the gods, i, e. the birth and growth of the words for god.&ldquo;938 He did not approve of the tendency to study the mythology of the Veda as isolated from the religion of the Veda. According to him, myth-buildjog was something morbid; a mythological religion always presupposed a healthy religion. Another favou. rite contention of MAX MULLER was that religion was closely connected with language, and that, therefore, the approach to the science of religion should be similar to that to the science of language. 39
MAX MULLER started his discussion of the Vedic religion with certain firm assumptions. All religions, according to him, had some common basic elements, such as the realisation of the Divine in the actual, the feeling of human weakness and depen dence, the faith in the divine ordering of the world, the conscious ness of good and bad, and the hope for a higher and better life. Again, all religions, howsoevermuch they might differ in other respects, agreed in one point, namely that their evidence was not

entirely supplıcd by sensuous perception If, then, all religious ideas transcended the limits of sensuous perception, to what did they owe thesr ongia? Two possibilities could be suggested in this connection Firstly one might think of some kind of external revelation Or one might assume that man possessed a religious instiact by which he, alone of all other living creatures, was enabled to perceive the infinite, the invisible, the divine MAX MULLER was not inclined to subscribe to any of these two views in entirety, though 10 connection with the Vedic religion, he does seem to have accepted an Uroffenbarung-an original revelation as implied by the word sruti. Proceeding further in his own peculiar way MAX MULLER pointed out that, by a simpl psychological analysis, one could discover &ldquo;three classes of things which we can perceive with our senses, but which leave in us three very distinct kinds of impression of reality 10 (1) Tangible objects, such as stones, shells, and bones, which were supposed to have been the earliest objects of religious worship by the religion historians who held fetishism to be the first beginning of all religion, 41 (2) Semi tangible objects, such as trees, moun tains rivers, the sea, and the earth, and (3) Intangible objects, such as the sky, the stars, the sun, the dawn, and the moon The testimony of the Veda, Max MULLER further pointed out, showed that out of the three foregoing classes of objects, the first was' hardly represented at all among the so called deities of the Rig Veda &ldquo;12 In other words, there were no traces of fetishism in RV, though, according to MAX MULLER, they began to appear is more modern hymns, particularly those of the Atharvaveda As for the semi tangible objects, each one of them could be met with among the deities of the Veda MAX MULLER has characterised such deities as semi deities in the intangible objects could be discovered the germs of what might be called full deities Indeed the various objects belonging to the second and

the third classes were the windows through which the ancient Vedic Aryans first looked into infinitude - into divinity, i
This, then, is a brief, but certainly not quite adequate, sketch of MAX MULLER&rsquo;s view regarding the origin of the Vedic religion. MAX MULLER&rsquo;s conception of the Vedic religion was essentially naturalistic. He believed that the Vedic poets always sought to perceive the divine &lsquo;, the supernatural&rsquo;, the infinite,' behind the natural'. All divinities, except those which, like the sky, the sun, etc, were actually visible, were anthropomor pbised. And, usually, a name was given to a god, which denoted the special characteristic of the nature (or form) of that god, such as Indra (from indu = drop) the rainer, Rudra the howler, Maruts the thrusters, and Varuna the all-encompasser 43 MAX MULLER was a comparative religionist and a comparative mythologist, and he raised the superstructure of his theories pertaining to the subject of religion and mythology on the three basic assumptions, namely, the assumption of a common IE pantheon of gods and a common IE mythology, the assumption that most of the mythology was made up of natural phenomena translated into the laoguage of myths and legends, and the assumption that etymologising the names of the Vedic gods helped, on the one hand, to illumine their character, and, on the other, to establish their relationship with their counterparts in other IE mythologies.44 He accepts, for instance, the identifica tion of Sārameyau with Hermeias ( as suggested by KUHN) and of Dyu-Niś with Dionysos (as suggested by BENFEY). Saramā is compared with Helena, and consequently with Uşas. Vivasvat and Saranyū (Erionys ) personify the sky and the dawn. Urvasi also is Usas or the dawn. Aditi, implying infinitude or immorta lity, is one of the oldest names of the dawn, that is, of that portion of the sky whence every morning the light and life of the world flash forth. She personifies the golden sea behind the dawn. Asvinau represent the day and the night, and Yama is</li>

It will be seen that a distinctive feature of MAX MULLER S view of the Vedic mythology is that, in his naturalistic conception of that mythology, he always emphasized a solar interpretation 48 One did not need to wonder, he said why so much of the old mythology the daily talk, of the Aryans was solar In his inimitably eloquent way he wrote “What else could it have been? The names of the sun are endless and so are his stories, but who he was whence he came and whither he went remained a mystery from beginning to end man looked up to the sun, yearning for the response of a soul, and though that response never came, though his senses recoiled, dazzled and blinded by an

effulgence wbich he could not support, yet he never doubted that the invisible was there, and that, where his senses failed him, where he could neither grasp nor comprehend, he might still shut his eyes and trust, fall down and worship.&ldquo;47 It should, however, be remembered that solarisation of many Vedic divinities marked but a subsequent stage in the evolution of the Vedic mythology, and that MAX MULLER&rsquo;s solar interpretation might refer only to that particular stage.
MAX MÜLLER&rsquo;s special contribution to the study of the Vedic religion is his theory of henotheism in RV. The earliest form of the religion of the Veda, he says, is neither polytheism nor monotheism; it is what he prefers to call henotheism or kathenotheism, that is to say, &ldquo;a successive belief in single supreme gods,&rdquo; It is to be clearly distinguished “from that phase of religious thought which we commonly call polytheism, in which the many gods are already subordinated to one supreme god, and by which therefore the craving after the one without a second has been more fully satisfied. In the Veda one god after another is invoked. For the time being, all that can be said of a divine being is ascribed to him. The poet, while addressing him, seems hardly to know of any other gods,&ldquo;48 To identify Indra, Agni, and Varuna is one thing; it is syncretism.49 To address either Indra or Agai or Varuna as, for the time being, the only god in existence with an entire forgetfulness of all other gods is quite another. It is this latter tendency, the henotheistic ten dency, which is fully developed and predominantly reflected in the hymns of RV.50 By way of traciog the further development</li>

The Italian scholar, Angclo de GUBERNATIS, was a compa. rativc mythologist, and, though he had been a pupil or WEBER, he mostly followed KUHIN, MAX MULLER, and George Cox, He wrote his principal work on the animals in the Indo-European mythology in Italian, but it was Srst published in an English translation under the file Zoological Mythology. In this book, GUBERNATIS has dealt with the animals under three calcgories, namely, the animals of the land (the bull and the cow being the most prominent among these), the animals of the mid-region, and the animals of water, and the starting point of the treatment 10 cach chapter is RV. The relationship between the gods and the animals is variously cxpressed. A god is compared with an animal, as, for instance, when Indra is called ursabha; or a dividity is represented as assuming the form of an animal, as, for instance, when Aditi is represented as a cow; or animals arc said to drive the vehicle of a divinity and thereby reflect its</li>

character and power. GUBERNATIS&rsquo;s interpretation of mytho logy is paturalistic; he believes that the myths based on the phenomena relating to the sky are brought down to the earth and carried forward in the form of fables, legends, and fairy-tales in ever newer variations. Accordiogly, whatever has been said about animals in mythology he traces back to the sun and the 1000, the thunderbolt, the lightning, the dawn, the clouds, the night and the darkness, and explaios it in the light of the mutual connections between these natural phenomena. He further points out that a large qumber of myths have originated out of
contradictions' and &lsquo;antetheses,&rsquo; that is to say, out of the contrasting forms in which these heavenly phenomena appear to one and the same observer, let alone, to different observers. Aurora is the morning and the evening twilight, but she appears also during the night, which fact explains why there is a reference to her slightiy demoniac character in some cases. Indra is the god of rain and thunder, but he is also the socturnal sup. About the two Aśvins, GUBERNATIS says that one of them represents the white moon and the other the sun, or he identifies them with the morning twilight and the evening twilight respectively. He further adds that Rāma and Laksmana are the epic representa tives of the Vedic Asyins. Among other identifications in zoolo gical mythology, suggested by GUBERNATIS, may be mentioned the following: The ass is the steed of the sun during the night; the goat is the sun; the stag represents the resplendent phenomena which appear in the cloudy or nocturnal forest; and the fox is the ruddy negotiator between the bright day and the dark night,
In another of his works, namely, Letture sopra la Mitologia Vedıca,51 GUBERNATIS treats of the Vedic gods, beginning with Dyauh and ending with Rudra, in a more or less elementary manner, He compares the Vedic myths variously with Christian concepts. Elsewhere,55 he has characterised RV as the Bible of the Aryans. The folk-religion of the Aryans, according to him,</li>

is born out of their observation of natural phenomena The hero of the bright phenomena is god, that of the dark ones is satan. GUBERNATIS asserts that mythology and epopea ' are necessarily interdependent At the same time, epopea' without war is unthinkable Therefore, in mythology, the concept of heavenly war must predominate Following this line of argument, GUBER NATIS discusses the different representations of this heavenly war in all the mandalas of RV one after another 50 For him, Vasistha, Visvämstra, and Sudās are all mythical characters 87 Even the essential basis of the Ramayana is, according to him, mythical Lanka is the cloud or the night, Rama is Visou or Indra, that is, the sun, Sitā is Usas or the dawn, the monkeys are the rays of the sun In this connection, it must be pointed out that the etymologies suggested by GUBERNATIS are not always sound and that his mythological equations are often bold and farfetched 58
A kind of reaction against the approach to the Vedic mytho logy exclusively from the point of view of comparative mytho logy - an approach which was so enthusiastically sponsored by KUHN and MAX MULLER - was but quite patural, and became evident, to a certain extent, 18 Jobo MUIR&rsquo;s Origmal Sanskrit Texts, so particularly in the fifth volume in the series.

He accepts the identification of Varuna with Ouranos, and consequently describes the former as representing the all-encompassing sky He cites ROTH and WCSTERGAARD in connection with the development of Varuna&rsquo;s character from the ancient sky god to the god of the ocean He also discusses the relationship between Varuna and Ahura Mazdah 61 As for Adili, MUIR considers her to be &lsquo;a personification of universal, all-embracing Nature, or Belog, while ROTH and MAX MULLER, on whom he normally depends, see in her the personification of infinity He refers to the view of GOLDSTUCKER, who distinguishes between the cosmic and the human or historical clements in the Aśvin-myth, and suggests that, like Rbhus, Aśvins were originally renowned mortals, who, 10 course of time, were translated into the companionship of
gods.63

If AUFRECHT was the first scholar to bring out a complete edition of RV, Alfred LUDWIG was the first to publish a complete German translation of that Veda. Actually two German transla tions-one by LUDWIG and the other by Hermann GRASSMANN appeared about the same time. The first part of GRASSMANN&rsquo;S translation of RV ( mandalas 2-8), with critical and exegetical notes, was issued at Leipzig in 1876, and the second part (manda las 1, 9, and 10 ) in 1877,63 LUDWIG&rsquo;s work was planned on a grander scale 61 It consisted of six volumes - volumes 1 and 2 contained a complete translation of the RV-Sanihita; volume 3 was intended to be a kind of an exhaustive iatroduction; volumes 4 and 5 constituted a detailed commentary: and volume 6 consisted of a register of citations, an index of conjectures, a glossary, and a material and grammatical repertory. The third volume of LUDWIG&rsquo;s work is entitled Die Mantralitteratur und das alle Indien, als Eilertung zur Übersetzung. In it, LUDWIG has brought together and supplemented through his own resear ches the findings in Vedic philology of ROTH, MAX MULLER, and MUIR, among others. it is, indeed, a rich storehouse of materials. So far as the Vedic mythology, religion, and philo sophy are concerned, it may be pointed out that LUDWIG has, among other things, commented upon such concepts as ta. brahman, saija, and mayã. He has rejected the identification of Varuna with Ouragos. Varuna, according to him, was not the sky-god in the elementary sense of the word; Dyauh was the proper sky-god. More or less similar to, but perhaps more systematically written than, LUDWIG&rsquo;s third volume is Heinrich ZIMMER&rsquo;S Altindisches Leben.66 Curiously enough, ZIMMER

has not at all dealt with mythology and ritual, though he has included in his book some sections on cosmology and astronomy, where his main authority is WEBER.
Friedrich BOLLENSEN is particularly well known as a critical editor of Sanskrit dramas, but he has also made a few interesting contributions to Vedic philology. In one of his &ldquo;Beiträge zur Kritik des Veda,&ldquo;67 he has dealt with the Vedic gods, Mitra, Varuna, Aryaman, and Indra. He depends largely on the etymologies of the names of these gods, but his etymologising is not always convincing. For instance, he derives mitra from the root smi which means to be bright, ito emit rays of light.' According to him, Varuna originally represented the day-light. He connects the word varuna with the root var, which, he says, often implies the same thing as the root vas ( - to shine). He understands devaḥ aryaḥ in RV VII. 64. 3 as referring to Aryaman, who, in his view, is the proper Deus Aricus. On the other hand, Indra (derived from the root indh), says BOLLENSEN, is the national god in the religious context. Aśvios are, for him, the morning star and the evening star.
A mention may be made at this stage of the rather peculiar views about the Veda of Hermann BRUNNHOFER. BRUNNHO FER begins by emphasizing that, as the first step towards a proper understanding of the Veda, one must free oneself from ROTH&rsquo;s interpretation of it. His own starting point is the study of the names of persons and places occurring in the Veda. Depending mainly on phonetic similarities, he connects these pames with the names of persons and places in ancient Iran, and asserts that the original home of the Indian Sanskrit-Aryans' was Iran and Turan, His principal work is entitled Iran und Turan,and comprises his historical-geographical and ethnologi cal investigations about the oldest scene of Indian ur-history. His methodology, based on phonetic equations, is fully illustrated in this book. He had already suggested that sakapūta in RV X.

sought to cut new paths. As against the lexical efforts of ROTH and GRASSMANN, BERGAIGNE insisted that, as far as possible, the meaning assigned to a Vedic word should be such as would be found adequate in all the passages where that particular word occurred Similarly, by way of a reaction against the methods of comparative mythology which had been, in a sense, overworked by KUHN and MAX MULLER, he restricted himself only to RV and tried to reconvey the profuse and apparently complex mythology of the Veda in a simple system which could be expressed in a few formulas. According to him, RV was full of priestly rhetoric, subtleties, and paradoxes,?? Mythology and cult were rigorously interdependent - one could not be properly explained without the aid of the other. The rsis of RV were themselves quite conscious of this interdependence.
The religion and mythology of RV, as systematised&rsquo; by BERGAIGNE in the form of what OLDENBERG calls algebraic' formulas, may be set forth, in broad outlines, as follows: The mythology of the Vedic Aryans is closely connected with their sacrificial cult. This latter, by the very rites which constitute it, or at least by the greater part of the formulas in which these rites are described, appears at once to be an imitation of certain celestial phenomena. These phenomena are of two kinds: (1) those which accompany the rising of the sun (solar phenomena ) and (2) those which accompany the fall of rain after a long drought (meteorological phenomena ). In both these kinds of phenomena, Vedic mythology distinguishes between male and female elements. The male element in the first group is the sun and the female element is the dawn (or dawns); the male and female elements in the second group are respectively lightning</li>
<li>According to OLDENBERG (Vedaforschung ), BERCAIGNE regarded RP as a product of bizarre rhetoric. OLDENBERC further says that BERCAIGNE did not bother to thunk of anything other than RV, he apparently pissed the point that the literature immediately following RV dealt with the same sacrificiar ritual for which the RV-hynns had been composed, and that, therefore, 115 literature could be regarded as a kind of commentary on RV, OLDENBERG adds that BERCAIONC rcalised the importance of this literature only in a last days.

193
and cloud (or waters). These different elements can be represen. ted differently in the framework of mythological anthropomor phism and zoomorphism.78 The supposed relationships among these elements are consequently reflected in the mythological connections among these beings of two sexes whether in human or animal form. For instance, the concomittance, priority, and posteriority of the patural phenomena are expressed in terms of sexual union or collateral kinship, paternity or maternity, and filialation of the mythical beings, respectively. Of course, these relationships can be confounded or reversed according to the different or manifold points of view. This would explain the incest between brother and sister, and father and daughter, referred to in the Veda, as also such descriptions as the daughter has given birth to the father the son has begotten his mothers.' The sun is represented as the son or the lover or the father of Usas; and the celestial waters are said to be either the mothers or the daughters of lightning. This mythological idiom is reproduced also in the description of the Vedic ritual. The Vedic ritual can be thought of as comprising two principal stages, namely, the stage of the preparation of the oblation and the stage of the oblation being offered into the sacred fire. Here, too, BER GAIGNB points to the male and the female elements. The male element is the fire and the female element is the oblation or the prayers, and both these are represented as corresponding to the male and the female elements of the celestial phenomena.79
One of the most basic assumptions of BERGAIGNE is that the sacrificial ritual is the true reproduction on earth of the cosmic happenings, that is to say, of the acts which are accom plished in heaven.80 The elements of the ritual are not mere</li>
<li>The most frequently occurring figures of animals are: (males) - bird, borse ( winged or otherwise ), bull, call, (females) - mare, cow.
79 The correspondence between the ritual and the natural phenomena is, according to BERCAIGNE, nowhere more evident than in the formulas which consecrate the relation of the prayers to the firc zad the consecrated beverage.</li>
<li>It may be recalled that this point had been adumbrated in thc writing of BURNOUF (Junior), some years before BERGAICNE wrote his book.

symbols of the elements of the celestial phenomena; they are, verily, identical with them in nature, and, like them derive their origin from heaven. Vedic sacrifice, it is emphasised, is not a mere imitation - it is actually accomplished by means of the elements borrowed from heaven by men who claimed origin from heaven, On the other hand, the natural phenomena are themselves regarded as sacrifice. BERGAIGNE explains that the real sigpi ficance of a sacrifice being conceived as a replica of the celestial phenomena is that, under the particular form of naturalistic worship, the sacrificial practice produces in effigy that which it is desired should take place in reality. It is a kind of symbolic magic which is common to most of the primitive peoples and continues even up to a well-advanced state of civilisation.1 BERGAIGNE further explains that the Vedic sacrifice, which is regulated according to the seasons of the year and even according to the hours of the day, has for its object the maintenance of the natural order of the world, in solar as well as meteorological phenomena It can prove efficacious enough even to fasten rain fall when needed.
BERGAIGNB&rsquo;s conception of the Vedic mythology is, in the main, naturalistic. He accepts from his predecessors the sugges tion that the principal phenomena of nature drawn upon by the Vedic mytbology are suprise and thunder. The various relations of heaven and earth are viewed as directly naturalistic 63 BER GAIGNE, however, hastens to add that the Vedic mythology also knows of other deities besides those which directly represent the clements, or the worlds in which these elements operate. In this connection, he mentions Pusap and Visnu 81 As for Indra, that god does derive his attributes from the elements over which he

rules. But he also has the character of a warrior-god.85 Accord ing to BERGAIGNE, Indra is the god who makes the sun rise after the dawn, and who, armed with the thunderbolt, makes the celestial waters flow. It is, however, pointed out that, in the case of Indra, the sacrificial magic becomes effective in respect of the celestial phenomena oply in an indirect way; Indra is said to be achieving his exploits, when intoxicated with Soma, In the context of Indra, BERGAIGNE makes a very significant observation. He speaks of a twofold conception of the order of the world in the Vedic mythology. In the Indra-mythology, this conception is
dualistic', while in the mythology relating to Varuna and Adityas, it is unitarian.' Both &lsquo;good&rsquo; and &lsquo;evil&rsquo; are involved in the Indra-mythology - the former being represented (in the physical sense ) in the form of light and rain and the latter in the form of darkness and drought. The &lsquo;good&rsquo; is related to Indra, the
evil' to Vrtra. As against this, Varuna (and Adityas) are sovereign gods. They rule over the world &lsquo;unopposed&rsquo;, while Indra has to wage constant wars. In the unitarian conception of the world-order in the Varuna-mythology, &lsquo;good&rsquo; and evil' are referred to one and the same god. Accordingly, Varuna&rsquo;s character has a double aspect - propitious and penal, while Indra is exclusively benevolent. Indra is always a friend, while Varuna acts like a judge.
The study of the sovereign gods like Varuna leads Ber GAIGNE to the consideration of the Vedic ideas about morality. He asserts that the RV-hymns are not the work of moralists. The purpose of these hymns is essentially ceremonial and ritua listic. The poets of RV have never sought to formulate morality in precepts. There may be, if at all, only vague generalisations regarding the vices to be supped and the virtues to be fostered.88</li>
<li>Agni and Soma, as the sun and the lightning, are also martial gods; they are conqucrors of night and drought, of dawns and waters. But the difference between these two and Indra lies in the degree of personifica. tion of the natural powers</li>

The lead given by BERGAIGNE In the matter of writing comprehensive treatises on the Vedic religion and mythology was enthusiastically followed by a number of well known Vedışıs A KAEGI&rsquo;s Der Rig Veda dre alteste Litteratur der Inder88 is a kid of general introduction to RV, and, to respect of Vedic exegesis, conforms largely to the ideas of ROTH ' According to KAEGI, the majority of the hymns of RV which he characterises as the premier intellectual monument of our race,&rdquo; mainly comprise invocations and glorifications of deities which are, in most cases, personifications of natural phenomepa They are prayers to the Eternal Ones and constitute perhaps the best specimens of vigor ous primeval poetry &quot; Les religions de l&rsquo;Inde by A BARTH91 is a

more solid work and contains many original ideas. BARTH has divided his book into two parts; in the first part he deals with the religion of the Veda, apd in the second with Brahmanism, that is, with the ritual and the philosophical speculations, and the decline of religion.92 The Veda, according to this scholar, is pre-eminently a &lsquo;sacerdotal&rsquo; literature - it can in no sense be called &lsquo;popular.&rsquo; Not even in the oldest hymos can one discover primitive natural simplicity. BARTH further asserts that to speak of a Vedic people' as such is quite unwarranted. We cannot think in terms of any such specific people whose ideology is reflected in the Veda. The hymns of RV not only constitute just a portion of the great thesaurus of the ancient Aryan poems, but they do not even represent the entire religious poetry of the early Vedic age. An important point stressed by BARTH is that, at the time of the RV-hymns, side by side with the hierarchical Vedic religion, there must have also existed several popular religious cults - cults such as those out of which Vaisnavism and Saivism arose in later times. Another point made by him is that, in RV, Varuna caa by no means be said to appear in a state of decay' (as suggested by ROTH) BARTH also says - and quite rightly-that it will not be proper for ope to seek to discover profound thought in every hymn of RV. In this connection, he deciares that the Vedic poets often strive to be unintelligible' and manifest afisc tation and indolence. 93

far as the correct understanding of RV is concerned He also discards the interpretations of most of the Western Vedists 5 He asserts that the hymns of RV contain neither the invocations to gods nor any mythology of gods, but that, almost exclusively and in ever newer variations, they describe sacrificial ritual This does not, of course, mean that they deal with the details of any specific sacrifice, but sacrifice in general is invariably their main concern They speak mainly of Agni and Soma, which latter, according to REGNAUD, is not a drink prepared from the juice of some plant, but an oil or a spirituous liquid with which the sacrificial fire is nourished Trying to determine the meanings of the words of RV through etymology, REGNAUD offers absolutely new inter pretation of many Vedic hymns For instance, he says that the two hymns to Usas (RV I 123, 124 ), the translation of which he has given in his monograph, do not celebrate the natural phenomena of the sun and the dawn, but that, under these symbols, they describe the sacrificial offering, the flame of Agni, and the flaming and inflammable liquid, Soma Similarly, in connection with his translation of RV IV 26 and 27, he gives his own interpretation of the myth of the advent of Soma » By and large, REGNAUD&rsquo;s approach to the Veda may be said to have been oriented by three assumptions, namely, that there is a complete break of tradition between RV and the later Sanskrit literature, 97 that, so far as RV is concerned, the readings are certain, the vocabulary uncertain, and the contents for the most part not properly understood, and that (and this is particularly important ) a large majority of Vedic words mean nourishment,' sacrificial offering &lsquo;98 In support of this last assumption,

REGNAUD shows, by means of his peculiar etymologising, that āji does not mean . battle, but that it is connected with ajya and &lsquo;means &lsquo;nourishment.&rsquo; Similarly, prstha does not mean back,&rdquo; but liquid; prthivi is the sacrificial liquid which widens&rsquo; in the course of its flow, and dyauh is the libation.' The ascription of such meanings to various Vedic words is obviously intended to confirm the hypothesis that RV is essentially a Veda of sacrifice.
E. W. HOPKINS has himself confessed that in writing his books' he had not desired to compete with BARTH book under the same title' However, it must be conceded tha the scope of the work of HOPKINS is larger than that of BARTH. HOPKINS first deals with the sources and methods and then gives a general description of India. He follows this with a statement (but not a critical discussion) about the pantheon of Vedic divinities and about the Brahmanic ritual and the Upanişadic speculations. The concluding part of his book is devoted to the consideration of popular Brahmanism, the Grhya-Sūtras, and the &lsquo;Dharma-Sūtras. HOPKINS&rsquo;s treatment of Vedic gods is conserva tive and cautious so far as the different schools of Vedic inter pretation are concerned. He divides these gods into three classes *upper,&rsquo; middle,' and &lsquo;lower.&rsquo; This classification is obviouly too vague, and cannot be said to be warranted by the facts of the Veda. Indeed, this entire section of HOPKINS&rsquo;s book betrays a lack of definite criteria on the part of the author. His treatment of the Vedic ritual also is deficient in the sense that many signifi caat concepts and practices have not found adequate exposition at his hands. HOPRINS does not have any specific theory of his Own regarding the Vedic religion, nor does he present that religion in its historical development. He is conscious of the various problems arising out of the complex nature of the Vedic religion, 1co but he seems to fight shy of tackling them squarely. Compared to HOPKINS&rsquo;s book, E. HARDY&rsquo;s Die vedische-brah manische Periode der Religion des alten Indiens,201 which was</li>

published a couple of years before, may be said to contain a little fuller and more systematic treatment of the Vedic religion 132 HARDY deals with the Vedic gods under different categories such as the sun and the moon gods, Varuna, Agni, Soma, Indra, the Taip and the wind gods, newer divinities, and genii, demons, aod spirits He has also devoted a few sections to the consideration of legends. sacrificial rites, religious practices, and theosophy But even HARDY&rsquo;s book is of the nature of a straightforward statement rather than of a critical exposition
The real compeers of BERGAIGNE in the field of Vedic religious and mythological studies and research are Alfred HILLEBRANDT and Hermann OLDENBERG Like BERGAIGNE, HILLEBRANDT also firmly believed that the Vedic mythology and the Vedic ritual were essentially inscparable The extension
of the Vedic mythology to the Vedic cult was a vital feature of his work 103 His study of the Vedic ritual was very deep - perhaps deeper than that of BERGAIGNE He was thus eminently equipped for the task which he had undertaken, but his expert knowledge of the Vedic ritual itself proved- not unoften - a serious handicap so far as a balanced estimate of the Vedic mythology was concerned 101 A prominent characteristic of HILLEPRANDT&rsquo;S mythology was a philological interpretation of the Vedic texts He sought to interpret the Veda as much as possible from itself He losisted on the essential distinction between Vedic and classical Sanskrit being properly appreciated As for Pall, he felt sure that it would not help much in the understanding of the Vedic mythology As a matter of fact, Pall had, according to him, already caused a good deal of misunderstanding It was HILLE BRANDT&rsquo;s contention that RV necessarily contained much that

could not be called &lsquo;Indiad. He said that, on the assumptioa of a restricted Indian provenance of Rr, much of it would remain upintelligible. A considerable portion of RV had its origin outside India. For instance, the eighth mandala showed un mistakable traces of the lands tying to the west and to the aorth of India. In this sense, RV&rsquo; had to be regarded as being more alin to the Avesta than to classical Saoskrit literature. HILLE BRANDT sought very little help from comparativc mythology. Similarly he was exceedingly wary in accepting the validity of etymology in mythological matters. Etymology, cven if correct (and one could not be too sure of its correctness !), was mytho logically uscless because the meaning which it furnislied was so general that it might designate a number of different things and consequently give no clue to the individual character of the god in question,103 A rcference may be made here also to HILLE BRANDT&rsquo;s confidence in his own methods and conclusions regarding the Vedic mythology. In spite of the severe criticisms and discussions of the thicories which he had set forth in the first edition of his Vedische Mythologie, he did not think it necessary to revise any of them substantially in the second edition which was published a quarter of a century after the first,
HILLEBRANDT adopted the view that most of the Vedic gods were personifications of natural phenomena. He believed that there was general agreement among Vedic scholars as to the gecessity of deriving most of the old Indian deities from physical phenomega,' but he was also aware that there was considerable difference of opioion among scholars about the specific natural phenomenon which a particular god was supposed to servesert 194 Further he was quite definite that the mythological materials in RV did not warrant the recognition of any abstract. deities, 107 or</li>

of any euhemeristic traces Ancestor-worship, he further said, had certainly been one side of ancient mythology, but it was not the only or even the most prominent one. The great lights of heaven, which regulated the course of time, created the summer and the winter, and dispelled the darkness of pight, could not have influenced the mind of the primitive man less than the belief In the power of the deceased or in maligo spirits HILLEBRANDT pointed out that the Vedic Aryans, whether herdsmen or husband men, were not entirely troglodytes, they felt more than we did the influence of these forces which governed their daily life &ndash; the sun and the moon, the storm and the weather Fetishism too, according to him, must be assigned but a very limited share in the Vedic mythology
HILLEBRANDT interpreted the ladra-Vrtra myth as reflecting the conflict between the demon of winter (Vrtra) and the sun of the spring season (Indra) He further pointed out that the Vedic tribes must have brought this myth to ladia from far away He did not accept the theory that lodra was a rais god and Vitra a cloud demon. According to him, clouds did not play any sigpifi cant role in RV. Varuna was, for him (as for OLDENBERG), the moon god, but he completely rejected OLDENBERG&rsquo;s other observations about the Varuna mythology 108 Aditi meant imperishableness, and not omnipresence or infinitude. According to HILLEBRANDT, brahman meant growth'. and Brhaspati. Brabmanaspat) was the lord of growth (that is, growth of plants) - the moon Indra, he added in this connection, was the Ksatriya among the gods and had developed from the physical phenomenon of the spring sun into a god warrior, Bphaspati was the heavenly Brahmana and purohita and took his origin from the moon as the presiding deity of the Brāhmanas 109 The most striking feature of HILLEBRANDT s exposition of the Vedic mythology is his assumption of the unique spiritual character imputed by the Vedic poets to the moon Indeed, he went to the

extent of asserting that the moon was the very centre of the Vedic religious ideology 110 Io the Indian belief, the sun occupied but a subordinate position HILLEBRANDT firmly maintained that, in the Veda, Soma was and had always been identical with the moon, the heavenly well of amrta 111 He insisted that the equa. tion, Soma = the moon, held good in every one of the Vedic contexts. He stoutly defended his lunar theory against various attacks When, for instance, it was argued that the reference in
RV to the roaring' of Scd would go against his lunar theory, he instantly retorted that there was nothing to be surprised at in such a reference, for, certain primitive peoples did actually speak of the moon as roanog &lsquo;1: A major part of HILLEBRANDT&rsquo;S writings was devoted to the reiteration that Soma, as the moon, dominated the entire Vedic religion and mythology Later on, he slightly modified this assertion by stating that, with Agni, Soma dominated the Vedic thought. But even Agoi was, accord ing to him, an aspect of the moon The same natural pheno menon underlay the conceptions of Agni and Brhaspati - 10 One case the fire form of the moon and in the other the nectar form of the mood 113 The aerial Agn was the moon, so was Apām Napāt the moon HILLEBRANDT was of the view that RV knew the three srauta fires the ahavanija was connected with Surya and the bearen, the garhapaly a with the terrestrial Agnt and the earth, and the dah sina with the aerial Agni and the mid region He further suggested that the semi-circular shape of the fire-place for the dah sina fire clearly symbolised the moon 114 Incidentally.

it may be pointed out at this stage, that HILLEBRANDT did not accept the threefold classification of the Vedic gods into celestial, atmospheric and terrestrial He thought that, though such classification was useful from the practical point of view, it was Open to several theoretical objections For one thing, the limits between these classes would be constantly shifting in accordance with the varying interpretation of the characters of the gods About Rudra HILLEBRANDT said that he was neither the chief of the souls of the dead nor the lord of the mountains, but that he was the god of the hot and rainy season which was the most dangerous time of the year in ladia Usas, according to HILLEB RANDT was not only the dawn of the single day, but she also personified the beginning of the year Usas represented the commencement of the ritual year and Rudra its conclusion 113 Surya was a mythological synonym of Usas, she was not the sun in female form in a sense Sarama also was mythologically equivalent to Usas In the Atharia eda, Usas was represented as Viraj whose two cales rose out of the sea and who was brought into connection with sacrifice

king at stated intervals. In another connection, he asserted that human sacrifice was the source of RV X. 18.8; 85, 21-22. Had human sacrifice not been an actual fact, the Brālmanas would not have preserved a record of it. As for animal sacrifice, HILLE BRANDT stated that, in the selection or avoidance of certain animals for sacrifice, no trace of totemism or theriomorphism could be found.118 He further said that the Indian conception of sacrifice was opposed to the Semitic in so far as the latter was an act of communion in which god and worshipper joined in partaking of the flesh of the animal, 119
OLDENBERG&rsquo;s Die Religion des Vedal20 certainly constitutes one of the most remarkable contributions to the study of Vedic religion and mythology. This book falls into two main parts - the first deals with the Vedic mytbology and the second with the Vedic cuit. Like BERGAIGNE, OLDENBERG fully realises the importance of the Vedic ritual for the proper understanding of the Vedic religion as a whole.121 He says that, without the background of the Vedic ritual, all discussion about the Vedic religion will lack the essential local colour. As for the scope of OLDENBERG&rsquo;s work, while BERGAIGNE bas restricted himself only to the hymns of RV, OLDENBERG covers the whole field of the Vedic literature, for, he believes tbat the literature immediately following RV deals with the same sacrificial ritual for which the hymns of RV are composed. OLDENBERG generally adheres to the naturalistic interpretation of the Vedic mythology. He says that the higher gods, that is to say, those gods which are not of a semi-divine or fetishistic nature,122 of the Vedic, and certainly also of the IE period, are without exception the deified represen tations of the entities in nature or of the forces which are active

OLDENBERG has put forth in his writings a number of origi nal ideas and theories about the Vedic religion and mythology
123 OLDENBERG speaks n the connect on of primary or ol le elements wh ch a e preser cd better nr ual than in poctry ani secondary or newer elements who lead to be ascr puion to the gods of inadeatal character such as that of b ngers of 1ht or uplolders of the cosmic order

207
A reference will, however, be made here only to the more impor tant ones from among them. One of such theories relates to the Varuna-mythology. OLDENBERG begins by pointing out that Varuna, Mitra, and Adityas constitute a homogeneous mythological unit in the Veda. This unit corresponds, in almost all respects, with the Avestan mythological unit comprising Ahura Mazdah, Mithra, and Amesha Spentas The ancient Iranian Mithra is universally recognized as the sud-god Conse quently his Vedic counterpart, Mitra, also must be regarded as representing the sun. Arguing further in this vein OLDENBERG suggests that Varuna, who is often associated with Mitra very closely but as being operative in a sphere opposite to that in which Mitra operates,125 has to be regarded as representing the moon 126 It would then naturally follow that Adityas represent the planets.127 The other point made by OLDENBERG in connection with the Varuņa-mythology is still more striking. He points out that Varuna, Mitra, and Adityas are specifically Indo Iranian divinities, that they do not have counterparts in other IE mythologies. At the same time, the Indo-Iranians already had a sun-god (Sürya ) and a moon-god (Candranas) endowed with more distinct characters. It is, therefore, suggested that the Indo-Iranians must have borrowed the conception of the addit10-' nal sun-god (Mitra) and moon-god (Varuna) from some neighbouring people. These people, it may be surmised, were the Akkadians (the Babylonians) who were particularly interested: in the planets128 and presumably had in their mythology a compact group of gods representing the sun, the moon, and the planets. Two other considerations would, according to OLDEN BERG, seem to confirm this surmise : firstly, that the Akkadians

<li>The Vedic and the Avestas Aryans originally had very line interest in the plancts,

EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
speak of their moon god cxactly as the Vedic Indians speak of Varuna, and, secondly, that an ethical god like Varuna can have been borrowed by the Indo Iranians from a people like the Akkadians who had adopted an ethical way of life before the Indo Europeans 129
Another special contribution of OLDENBERG&rsquo;s to the study of the Vedic mythology is his assumption regarding the existence in RV of what may be called abstract divinitics The deities in RV which admit of being regarded as abstractions are of three types (1) deities resulting from purely allegorical personiGcations of abstract ideas like Manyu and Sraddhā, 130 (2) deities in whose case the attributes or epithets are transformed into individual names, such as Prajapati, Brhaspati, etc , 131 and (3) deities whose names originate from the particular spheres of their activities - each such name having the form of a nomen agentis, Ike Savitr (impeller), Vişnu (wanderer). Tvast (fashioner), and Pusan ( nourisher) As has been already pointed out HILLEBRANDT takes a strong objection to OLDENBERG&rsquo;s con ception of abstract divinities He says that they do not seem to be the gods of a rational and realistic people He caustically observes that such dividities would show that the Vedic poets worked not in nature but in a study room
According to OLDENBERG, Indra is a storm god who bears certain pre lodian features He emphasises the point that, in RY, Indra is nowhere spoken of as &lsquo;raining&rsquo; He agrees with HILLEBRANDT&rsquo;s observation that clouds as such do not play any great role in that Veda OLDENBERG accordingly thinks that the RV poets understood the release of waters by Indra pot as the release of celestial waters but as the setting free of terrestrial waters from terrestrial mountains He explains Indra&rsquo;s winning
129 OLDENBERG lays great stress on the consp cuous contrast between Indra who is a truly IE god and Varuna who is adopted by the lodo Iranians from a Semic people

of light metaphorically as the attainment of bright goods after overcoming terrible dangers ' 132 OLDENBERG accepts the identification of Parjanya with Perkunas and suggests that that god definitely goes back to the IE period. For him, Apām Napāt does not personify lightning; he rather personifies &lsquo;the fire in all water, especially rivers and ponds&rsquo;. Similarly, Rudra is not the storm-god; he is a demon of disease coming from forest and mountain, like Mars Silvanus. OLDENBERG, following MANNHARDT, regards Aśvinau as representing the morning star and the evening star. He points out, in support of this assumption, that the morning star is the only light beside the morning fire, the dawn, and the sun, that the time of Aśvinau, theic luminous nature, and their course around the heavens are applicable to the star, that the star of the evening is naturally asso ciated with the morning star, and that the evidence of comparative mythology favours such an assumption 183 As for Soma, OLDEN BERG severely criticises HILLEBRANDT&rsquo;s view that, throughout RV, Soma stands for the moon. He has no doubt that, in a large majority of passages, Soma clearly personifies a special ritual plant and its juice. The identification of Soma with the moon begins to occur only in later literature. In RV, the moon is nowhere said to be the food of gods. In RV X. 85, the lunar character of Soma is referred to as a secret knovo only to the Brāhmanas. This would show that such character was but incipient. In some cases, again, the identification of Soma and the moon has to be regarded just as the result of poetic imagery.
OLDENBERG also adversely criticises MAX MÜLLER&rsquo;s theory of henotheism, that is to say, the theory of the Vedic belief in individual gods alternately regarded as the highest. 5131 He points out that, on the one hand, hymos addressed to Viśve Devas are frequent, in which all deities, even the lesser ones, are praised in</li>

succession, and, on the other, the technical priest cannot but have koown the exact relative position of each god in the Soma ritual, for which the great mass of Vedic hymns are composed and which includes the worship of almost the entire pantheon Henotheism is, therefore, rather an appearance than a reality The indefinite ness of outline in the Vedic gods and the natural exaggeration of the poet priest in extolling the attributes of the god he is addressing seem to have been the main factors operative in this congection
OLDENBERG&rsquo;s discussion of the Vedic ritual is quite illumi nating in the course of this discussion he has profusely drawn upon anthropological and ethnological materials He points out that the Vedic ritual indicates predominantly the benevolent character of the principal Vedic gods 135 The oldest Vedic ritual, he states, knows of seven priests with distinct functions - the brahman priest having been non-existent in the oldest portions of RV 156 Comparatively speaking, the element of thanksgiving is mostly absent in Vedic sacrifice 137 Similarly the magical element also is not very conspicuous in the early Vedic ritual 139 The Vedic people, however, had in their ritual the rite of initiation (diksā) in common with the most diverse primitive peoples The object of this rite was to bring about an intercourse between the sacrificer and the gods by inducing a kind of ecstatic condition. OLDENBERG recognises the existence of only certain traces of human sacrifice in the Vedic ritual, as, for instance, in the rite connected with the agnicayana, wherein man is one of the five

sacrificial victims. Howcver, the Satapatha-Brāhmana already refers to the human sacrifice as a thing of the past, and substitutes are already seen to have begun to be cmployed. As has been pointed out elsewhere, OLDENBERG agrees with HILLCBRANDT in assuming that the Indian conception of sacrifice is opposed to the Semitic in so far as the latter is an act of communion in which god and worshipper join in partaking of the flesh of the animal.139
A distinguished English contemporary of HILLEBRANDT and OLDENBERG was Arthur A. MACDONELL. The nature and extent of MACDONELL&rsquo;s famous book, Vedic Afythology,140 were perhaps determined, to a certain extent, by the series in which it was published, namely, &ldquo;Grundriss der indo-arischen Philologic und Altertumstunde.&rdquo; As required by the Grundriss, MACDO NELL&rsquo;S Vedic Alythology is characterised by a careful and intel. ligent collation and lucid exposition of all relevant material relating to the subject. In this book, the author has attempted a detailed but discerning statement about Vedic gods and heroes catirely on the basis of original texts. Accordingly, as was expected, the book constitutes a most valuable source-book for the study of the Vedic mythology 11 MACDONELL begins by stating the general problems connected with the Vedic religion and mythology and outlining the method to be pursued in tackling those problems. He then makes a few observations regarding the Vedic conceptions of the world and its origin. Then comes the main part of the book embodying the description of the Vedic gods who are considered under various categories, such as celestial gods, atmospheric gods, terrestrial gods, abstract divinities,
139 Incidentally, reference may be made here to two more points : Firstly OLDENBERG does not doubt the existence of totemism in the Vedic religion He further suggests that, in view of the existence of totemin also in Greece and Italy, totemism must be regarded as IC. Secondly, he thinks (10 opposition to Rotu) that RP refer, though indirectly, to a belief in hell

goddesses, dual diuinitics, groups of divities, and lower divinities This is followed by sections dcaling with pricsts and herocs, animals and objects, demons, and eschatolosy So far as the description of tlic Vedic gods is concerned, MACDONELL first gives the characteristic (catures of cach god, independent of any critical spierprctation, and then adds at the end a cry brief scvic of the different victs which huc been put forth by scholars in connection with the personality and character of that particular god It will be seen from the scheme of MACDONCLL&rsquo;s book, as set forth above, that, in bus itcaiment of the Vedic mytholos), the author, unlike BCRGAIGNE, HILLCHRANDT, and OLDENBERO, has kept aside the subject of Vedic ritual almost catirely flis classification of the Vedic gods most of whom he regards as personifcations of natural powers and phenomena, is far 100 schematic, and, though perhaps useful (rom the practical point of VICW, 15 theoretically not sound Again, in his brok, MACDO NELL has not sought cither to enunciato any original theories of his own or to subject to a critical cxamination the theories of other scholars Altogether, his book is esscntially retrospective&rsquo; in character
It is, hoxcrcr, possible to denle some of MACRONELL&rsquo;S salicnt views on the various aspects of the Vedic mythology from his other writings and critical revicus Tor instance, he took strong objection to OLDENBERG&rsquo;s suggestion that the waters released by Indra were understood by the Vedic pocis to haic been thc terrestrial waters set free from the terrestrial mountains MACDONELL felt certain that the Indra-Vrtra fight basically reflected an atmospheric phenomenon, and that by the waters set free by Indra were meant the waters released from the clouds. Indra was the rain god, and, though he was nowhere in RW referred to as &lsquo;raining, the stercotyped mythological terms used to describe the phenomenon hardly Ict any doubt about the character of that god At the basis of the identification of Varuna with Ouranos, MACDONCLL saw not only 1 phonclic equation but also a fundamental equation of conceptions He hesitated to accept the suggested correspondence between the

213
Vedic Adityas and the Avestan Amesha Spentas.142 He pointed out that OLDENBERG&rsquo;s theory that Adityas personified the seven planets was not at all convincing. For one thing, the number seven was scarcely characteristic of Adityas – pot more than six were mentioned in RV, while in the Athanaveda eight Adityas were mentioned. Incidentally, he asserted that the moon had always bees regarded in India as a lesser divinity than the sup.243 Accord ingly, the great Asura Varuna could hardly be said to have personified the moon, MACDONELL found HILLEBRANDT&rsquo;S suggestion that Soma was the moon-god throughout RV too dogmatic. Soma originally personificd the ritual plant, and, even in bis subsequent cosmic aspect, be was more akin to the sun than to tåe moon. In RV, he was described in words applicable to the sun and was never expressly connected with the moon. How was it, MACDONELL asked, that none of the Vedic commentators, in whose time Soma and the moon were believed to be one, ever mentioned that Soma was the moon-god also in RV? The later identification of Soma with the moon, according to him, went hand in hand with the separation of the world of gods associated with the sun from the world of Pitars conaccted with the moon. BỊhaspati, MACPONELL pointed out, was originally an epithet representing sacerdotal side of Agoi&rsquo;s nature. which had already at the beginning of the RV-period acquired an independent character. He, therefore, regarded Byhaspati as a terrestrial divipity. There was no doubt that Apām Napāt was connected with lightning Referring to OLDENBERG&rsquo;s suggestion that Apám Napāt was the fire in all water, especially in rivers and ponds.&rdquo; MACDONELL asked how such extinguished fire could shine forth’and that too in the highest place. He did not also agree with HILLEBRANDT who had suggested that the semi-circular shape of the fire-place of the dakşına fire symbolised the soon. According to him, it rather denoted the arch of the mid-recian 14
214

MACDONELL was inclined to accept GOLDSTUCKER&rsquo;s view that Asvins represented the inseparable duality of light and darkness which constituted the morning twilight 145 Savits was clearly the sun god MACDONELL took OLDENBERG to task for having unnecessarily invcrted the probable order of the cvolution of the personality of that god by suggesting that Sayitr originally repre sented a pure abstraction, but later attracted a large body of solar traits. HILLCBRANDT&rsquo;s characterisation of Rudra as the god of the most dangerous scason of the year did not accord with the Rgvedic mode of thought Nor could one accept OLDEN BERG&rsquo;s comparison of Rudra with Mars Silvanus Maruts were the children of Rudra How could Rudra&rsquo;s character be so different from that of his children? MACDONELL thought that the evidence of RV was not sufficient to indicate what natural substratum Rudra had It would, however, appear that Rudra was the storm god in whom the balcful nature of lightning was prominent, as against its action which was wholly beneficial to man in the case of Indra MACDONELL further pointed out that one widely diffused primitive conception which the Indo Europeans must have inlierited from an carlier stage was the notion of heaven and earth having been the universal parents
jf. through his Vidic My thology, MACDONELL provides a fairly comprehensive and useful catalogue of facts about the Vedic mythology, Maurice BLOOMFIELD, in his The Religion of the Veda, 140 presents a very readable account of the development of the Vedic religion from RV to the Upanisads BLOOMFIELD deals in his lectures147 with such topics as India the land of religions, the priestly religion, the pre historic gods of lodia and the beginnings of Hindu theosophy, and his exposition is unle formly clear and consistent His general attitude towards the

interpretation of the Vedic mythology is said to be onc of wise conservatism. This becomes evident in his third lecture wherein under the title &quot; The Pre-historic Gods of India,&rdquo; he has treated of Vedic and IE mythology. Ile sticks to the identification of Varuna with Ouranos, in spite of the lunar theories newly advo cated by HILLEBRANDT and OLDENBERG. It may, however, be pointed out that BLOOMFIELD seems to agree with HILLE BRANDT in his assumption that, in RV, Soma uniformly personifies the moon.god, though he rejects that scholar&rsquo;s sugges tion that the worship of the moon dominates the religious thought of RV. He is also not inclined to accept HILLEBRANDT&rsquo;S interpretation of the Indra-Vrtra myth as reflecting the conflict between the winter-demon and the spring-sun. BLOOMFIELD favours the methods of comparative mythology and refers with approval to such equations as Sārameyau = Cerberus. He does not find any clear traces of totemism in the Veda, though he thinks that some of the Vedic gods may have been originally represented in the form of animals, which later became the vehicles of those gods. In this connection he suggests that Asyins were presumably reckoned as flamingos.
BLOOMFIELD is rather reluctant to admit any settled intel lectual religious consciousness&rsquo; in RV. He is aware that, while singing of the wonderful achievements of their gods, the poets of RV do grow truly warm and feel their theme - that sometimes they are really carried away by it-, but he does not believe that
either the greatness and majesty or the incomprehensibleness of the gods have produced a permanent impression of their superio rity and perfection. He further points out that the so-called
henotheism in RV does not have quite the true riog - it is perfunctory. God after god is glorified as the highest, they each in tura establish the heavens and the earth, they start the sun on his course, almost indifferently well. It would, however, seem that it was the rotation of the gods in the Vedic ritual, rather than the forgetfulness of the virtues of the preceding god, which was at the bottom of hepotheism. Henotheism, says BLOOM FIELD, is &quot; polytheism grown cold in service, and unnice in its
216
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
distinctions, leading to an opportunist monotheism in which every god takes hold of the sceptre apd none keeps it.&rdquo; Two other significant points made by BLOOMFIELD in the course of his discussion of the Vedic religion and philosophy relate respectively to the doctrine of the Ātman and the doctrine of Bhakti. He entirely discountedances the theory143 that the Atman-doctrine originated among the Ksatriyas. He also holds that the Bhakti ideology is fairly ancient in India and has grown side by side with and within the same circles of thought as the colder monism of the Upanışads. According to BLOOMFIELD, Yājõavalkya does not intend to expound to Maitreyi “the extremes of supersensual rationalism.&rdquo; In effect, the Upanışadıc seer expresses the ideal of union with the supreme being, which is really the kernel of the doctrine of Bhakti, He wants to suggest that the knowledge of the Supreme is but a preparation for the love of God.
Leopold von SCHROEDER may be said to have revived the school of comparative mythology which had, to a certain extent, fallen into disrepute in the intervening period. His Arische Religion149 does not contain much new material on the subject. There is evident in that book the same old tendency to advance mythological equations, often on the basis of bad etymologies. Trita Āptya is, for instance, identified with Athena Tritonis, Sārameya with Hermes, and Panis with Priam.150 Apollo is said to be closely akin to Agai, while Aegis is understood to represent the dark thunder-cloud However, SCHROEDER&rsquo;S carlier work161 is more interesting from the point of view of Vedic folklore and popular religion. The central theme of the book is the so-called dialogue-hymns in RV. In these dialogue-hymns, SCHROEDER discovers the texts of ancient mysteries and mimes, relics of a drama which died out later (the later Samhitas and the Brāhmanas having nothing parallel to it) agd which is not histori</li>

cally connected with the later drami though the latter sprang from the same roots 151 He further connects thosc dramatic pieces with the Vedic vegetation ritual. He finds clear traces of this latter in such myths as of Agastya and Lopamudrā, Yama apd Yami, and Vpsühap: 153 Similarly, according to SCHROE DER, Vedic Maruts shou really charactcristic features of an ancient vegetation-ritual In this connection he points out that, in the IE tribes, the youth among the people performed, at certain scasons of festival, dances at wluch arms were borne and 10 which the performers represented the souls of the dead 154 SCHROEDER suggested that the decay of the ritual drama in Vedic times was due to the opposition of the priesthood to phallic ritual
M WINTERNITZ saw in RV a mythology in the making 15 He believed that, in that Veda, originally, natural phenomena were glorified as such Gradually these natural phenomena were transformed into mythological figures The names of gods such as Indra, Varuna, etc, originally indicated certain natural pheno mena and natural beings In course of time, the epithets, which at first emphasized a particularly important side of a natural being, became god&rsquo;s names and new gods. One could thus see gods arising, as it were, before one&rsquo;s eyes In his Le Vedisme, 156 L de LA VALLÉ POUSSIN contests this view of WINTERNITZ He asserts that the Vedic mytliology as represented in RV is already a fully accomplished fact - it is a system whosc origins are already far past.

a simple formula. For instance, the peculiar ideology associated with Varupa cannot be logically derived from the simple myth of the sky by night. Similarly the ethical conception of fla cannot be derived merely from the observance of physical order. LA VALLÉE POUSSIN believes that, in this connection, the reminis cences of an ancient philosophy must have been operative. He further points out that the IE sky-god, Dyaub, cagnot lave been a primitive bigh god. According to him, the character of Rudra is made up of Aryan and Hindu elements. LA VALLÉE POUSSIN admits the presence of fetishism 10 the Vedic religion, The fetishistic use of animal and material objects in the Vedic ritual caq by no means be denied. But such use need not be regarded as the most primitive. It will be seen that the sacrificer clearly distinguishes between the god and the temporary presence of the divine spirit in the animal or the jostruments,167 Inciden tally, one of the interesting observations made by LA VALLÉE POUSSIN is that the Atharvaveda, with all its degradation, is an aristocratic Veda.
An emphatically Indian orientation given to Vedic research this was the most essential feature of the work of Richard PISCHEL and Karl F. GELDNER. It is clear from the maior part of their writings158 that these scholars were mainly occupied with the Vedic exegesis rather than with the Vedic mythology. But it must be remembered that the study of the Vedic mythology had developed and in hand with Vedic word-philology and that, therefore, the two were almost inseparable. PISCHEL and GELDNER started with the firm belief that RV was an Indian, and exclusively an Indian, literature. Therefore, in order to under stand RV adequately, one had to understand India thoroughly. Linguistics, which connected India&rsquo;s languages with the European languages, was a dangerous guide. It was decessary to recognise that the gulf between the earliest culture of the European Aryans and that of the Vedic age was such that no amount of phonetic

equations could bridge it. The most dependable guide in the matter of the understanding of RV was the totality of the later Indian literature. For, in their thinking and feeling, the people of India had ever remained &quot; basically an Indian people with an Indian spirit&rdquo;. One could see them as such as clearly in the hymns of Vasistha and Visvamitra as in the Kadambari of Bāņa, This attitude of PISCHEL and GELDNER obviously reflected a strong reaction against the work of comparative linguisticians and comparative mythologists - against, that is to say, the &ldquo;joteria tional generalities ” jo which the scholars of the earlier periods had indulged. PISCHEL and GELDNER also represented a strong reaction against ROTH&rsquo;s school of Vedic interpretation, whose slogan was: Away from Sayana. These two scholars asserted equally vehemently that Sāyana had comprehended the true chara cter of RV far more adequately than the European Vedists. They declared that the Veda - its language, its religion, and its moral ideas - must be interpreted with the help of the later Hindu litera ture. The key to the understanding of the Vedic literature was to be found in the critical analysis of the post-Vedic Jiterature.159 Indeed, these scholars sought to prove that beneath the words and phrases of RV lay ideas which subsequently &quot; found expression in the Brālimanas, the later religious hand-books, the epics, and even the belles lettres of the classical period.”
As in Vedic exegesis so in Vedic mythology the main empha sis of PISCHEL and GELDNER was on the specifically Indian current of thought. The Vedic mythology, they said, must be expounded in the light of the later Indian mythology and not of IE mythological concepts. It was their contention that the entire mythology of RV manifested a distinctly Indian stamp. For an adequate understanding of the Vedic mythology, one had, there fore, to derive help from the classical Hindu mythology and even the contemporary Indian folk-religion, 160 Accordingly, PISCHEL

and GELDNER, seems to have become more pronounced in the subsequent periods. Sten KONOW, for instance, unequivocally declared in his The Aryan Gods of the Mitan People162 that the conception of Vedic religion as a worship of nature and natural phenomena was fundamentally wrong.163 Another tendency which had become prominent besides this anti-naturalista was the more marked awareness of the prevalence in the Vedic religion of what might be called the ideology of primitive magic. In this context, mention may be made of the marvellous work of W. CALAND. CALAND concerned himself more or less exclusively with a critical study of the literature and practices of the Vedic ritual. He fully realised that the Vedic ritual was for the most part a Zauber Ritual, and that, in order adequately to understand that ritual it was necessary to have a fair knowledge of the magic-ritual thought and practices of other primitive peoples. He specially stressed the point that, to be able to expound the Vedic ritual correctly, a philologist had to be a competent ethnologist and an ethnologist a qualified philologist. It was, however, not only in the Vedic ritual that the element of magic had been so conspicuous. The primitive magic-ideology dominated the Vedic mythology also. As typifying the two-fold tendency of anti-naturalism and emphasis on the magic-ideology may be mentioned Hermann GÜNTERT&rsquo;S remarkable book, Der arische Weltkonig und Heiland,161 This book is a veritable thesaurus of ingenious ideas and suggestions. GUNTERT seeks to investigate, mainly in the light of linguistics, the origin in the remotest prehistoric times, the growth, and the transformations of certain religious and ethical concepts of the IE-speaking peoples. In a sense, his work pertains to the questions of historical semasiology. Making the

mythology is quite conventional; he adheres to the view that the Vedic divinities are manifestations of various forces of nature. However, he speaks of Varuna as the lord of the ethical law, of Indra as the lord of the cosmic law, and of Agoi as the lord of the ritual order, asserting that each of these gods has his own rta. He further adds that Iodra is also the god of heroic action, that he represents an apotheosis of the traits “which the Aryans lost more or less through the influence of climate and the fusion with the aborigines.” It may be incidentally pointed out that GRISWOLD&rsquo;s writing occasionally betrays a tendency to interpret (obviously in a forced manner) the names and functions of the Vedic gods according to his own fundamental notions and to read, into Vedic passages, the ideas of later times as, for instance, in his discussion of the Vedic conception of sin. One also wonders whether the concluding chapter, in which the author deals with the religion of RV as a preparation for Christianity, does not detract from the generally sober outlook of the book.169
If HILLEBRANDT was the moon-mythologist, Johannes HERTEL may be said to have been the fire-mythologist. The essence of HERTEL&rsquo;s conception of Vedic religion and mythology was that they revolved round the central theme of light and fire.169 He believed that fire surrounded the world and pervaded every individual being. Fire was thus a universal power in macrocosm and microcosm. He further believed that, in the Veda, fire was identified with vaderstanding (wisdom, reason, prudence) and power. Indeed, he also believed that these two ideas were not restricted only to the Veda, but that they had already been Aryan (Indo-Iranian), and, in all probability, even todogermanic. HERTEL firmly stuck to his doctrine that brahman ( which word he connected with phlegma) originally denpted the cosmic fire which streamed forth into the world, through the fifts in its covering, in

the form of the sun the moon, and other constellations 1&quot;0 He pointed out that the Aryans regarded both Somn and milk as the liquid form of this heavenly firet and imagined that by drinking them they absorbed that fire into their hearts He even suggested that the cremation of the dead was actually meant to facilitate the passage from the mortal to the fiery (spiritual) body HERTEL sought to establish these peculiar theories of his regard ing the early Indo Irndian Weltanschauums on the basis of a critical examination of such words as saksa dhena and vasu Re insisted that these words Originally denoted light and fire, and that that primitive meaning was bot only suitable but was also necessary in the various Vedic (and Avestan) passages where those words occurred His discussion in this connection was however obviously one sided and clearly smacked of dogmatism HERTEL often referred to the dualism between the powers of light and fire (whose incarnations were the Devas who were the givers of rain and fire and who likewise were the embodiments of the highest wisdom and power and the powers of darkness This dualism also was Indogermanic, and did not begia, as had been generally supposed with Zoroastrianism According to HERTEL the Indogermanic Deva religion was represcnted in its purest form in RV and in its next best form in the older Yasts Among other striking ideas put forth by HERTEL may be men tioned his identification of Ahura Mazdah with Bphaspati He suggested that both these divinities represented the God of heaven who had been deprived of all naturalistic attributes but in whom the concept of heavenly fire had been preserved Then there is his assumption of the conflict between the Indra worshipping tribesVEDIC RELIGION AND MYTHOLOGY

and the Mithra-adoring tribes the Mazda yasnians). He believed that a reference to the condlict occurred in RV X. 22. The Kayis mentioned in the tenth stanza of that hymn were, according to him, the Avestan tribes of East Iran. They were there characte rised as naksatrašaras, that is, as &ldquo;deriving divine fire or inspira tion (saras) from the stars,&ldquo;1&rdquo;? because the East Iranians looked upon the constellations Tistrya and Satavaēsa, and, above all, upon Mithra (= the starry heaven), as being pecularly endowed with this divine fire.
Rudolf OTTO is one of the few scholars who has approached Vedic religion and mythology not as a philologist or an Indologist, but from the point of view of the psychology and evolution of reli gion as such.173 Actually what he has sought to do in his Gottheit und Gottheiten der Anerl7t is to apply to the Vedic religion his theory about the origin of the conception of divinity 175 His starting point is that the genesis of the Vedic gods (or, for the matter of that, of any gods ) cannot be traced back to the effects produced on men&rsquo;s minds by the great phenomena of nature, such as the sun, the sky, the storm, thc winds, ctc. It is the specific and a priori faculty of apperception of a power, which may best be termed a &lsquo;numer&rsquo;, that is at the bottom of all consciousness of divinity. OTTO tries to define aumen negatively by pointing out that it does not signify mere terror or mere wonder. It is a complex entity, and among its constituents may be mentioped a consciouspess of might which involves respect, a feeling of the presence of power which may be expressed as wrath (manyu) or as glowing flame, and a kind of victorious majesty. It reveals itself through a natural dualism of wrath and mercy. Further, this numen may exist within man himself,178 or outside man in

Dyauh is not the sky-god, but denotes simply a god.183 Mahi Dyauh mentioned in RV X. 133. 5 is the precursor of Mahādeva.18€ Speaking of Maruts, OTTO rejects the usual suggestion that they are the storm.gods. He thinks that men living close to nature are not likely to be so affected by the natural phenomena as to be inclined to ascribe to Maruts the characteristics of anger and fury which are assigned to them in RV. Maruts are, indeed, conceived not merely as dreadful but also as demoniac. In this connection, OTTO makes an important point. He says that the idea of &lsquo;demoniacness&rsquo; does not arise in man&rsquo;s mind after he has come across the storm. winds; it is already there in his mind. He only projects it, as it were, and finds a suitable substratum for it in the storm-winds. The Aryans have apperceived the numinous also in such animals as the horse and the ox, as is testified by the mythological concepts of Dadhikrā,185, Dadhyar, aad Aśvins. OTTO connects AŚvins with the primitive yoke of cattle, 186 in which the pastoral people located a numen. The idea was subsequently transferred to steeds. Ašvins came to be eventually regarded as saviour-gods because they were originally supposed to aid man with the homely
products derived from the ox and the cow.
The most significant contribution of J. PRZYLUSKI to the study of the Vedic mythology was that he drew pointed attention to what might be called the non-Aryan (non-IE) elements in that mythology.

had come into contact with the Austro-Asiatic people at various points in the course of their wanderings and colonisation activities, and had thereby been substantially influenced in their way of life and thought By way of a striking example of such influence he mentioned the Vedic Varuna-mythology 187 The concept of Varuna, he asserted, was borrowed by the Vedic Aryans from the neighbouring Austro Asiatic people These latter worshipped the god of sea as their greatest god The realm of this god lay beneath the waters of the sea The Aryans, having come into contact with the Austro Asiatic people, borrowed from them their great god in his original character as the god of sea That was Varuna PRZYLUSKI agreed with PISCHEL and KRETSCH MER188 10 their assumption that Vedic Varuna was originally the god of ocean According to him, the introduction of this new god into the Aryan mythology marked the weakening of the Brahmanic orthodoxy and the entry upon the scene of the recently assimilated population PRZYLUSKI suggested that, just as the concept of Varuna was derived from the Austro Asiatic mythology, the name Varuna also was derived from the Austro Asiatic language The name Varuna was connected with the Austro Asiatic word baru (bharu) which meant &lsquo;sea&rsquo; However, PRZYLUSKI went on to point out, siace, for the continental Aryans, the sea did not have the same impor tance as for the maritime Austro-Asiatic people, in the Vedic religion, the sovereign god could not be regarded as residing at the bottom of the ocean He had to be elevated and enthroned in the highest heaven, on the top of the world-mountain Varuna thus first came to be attached to Asura, the god of the sky, and was eventually identified with him Nevertheless, a section from among the Aryans always remained faithful to the Austro Asiatic

The concepts of Aditi and Asvios provided, according to PRZYLUSKI, further evidence of the non-Aryan elements in the Vedic mothology,190 PRZYLUSKI found for Aditi a prototype in the Great Goddess of the early religions of Western Asia.191 A special feature of the ritual connected with chis Great Goddess was flagellation, the main purpose of which was the renewal of the life of the creatures, the augmentation of their vigour, and the stimulation of their power of reproduction. Some traces of the idea of flagellation could be discovered in the Adıtı-mythology in the Veda. In a passage in the Atharvaveda (IX. 1), Aditi was frequently referred to as madhukaša;18% and, in the primitive ideology, both madiu ( honey) and kaśā (whip) were the princi pal constituents of the ritual of flagellation. PRZYLUSKI further pointed out that Aśvins too were closely connected with madhu. This conceptual affinity between Aditi and Asvigs was but a

The religion of the Aryans developed in the opposite directions One section adopted the Hittite Arupa, god of the sca, these were the ancestors of the Indians, who, during the post Vedic times, continued to recognise in Varuna a sea god As for the Indians who adherep to the Vedic relgion, they amalgamatcd Aruna and Asura, the god of the sea and the god of the sky. The worshippers of Varuda, the sca-god, regarded those, who made Varuna the Asura, as hercucs, and in the end the belich of the former prevaucd after the Vedic epoch. According to KRETSCHNER, all Indiang had to pass through a sorc-Asiatic epoch, which left clear traces in their religion, language, and culturc Like Varuda, Indra also was traced back to the Hittite mythology KRETSCHMER connects Indra with the Hittito god Inaras (&rdquo; Zum Ursprung des Gottes Indra,&rdquo; Wien, 1927, and &ldquo;Indra vad der heilutische Gott Ioaras,&rdquo; KT I, 1928).

reflection of the West Asian mythology relating to the Great Goddess attended by two cavaliers (originally by two animals, by two horses) 193 In the Veda, Asvins were sometimes represented as the attendants of Aditi The original non-Aryan character of Asyins seems to have been indicated by their other name Nāsatyau This latter name was presumably an Aryanısed form of some Austro Asiatic word satja might be connected with Austro Asiatic sadam which means horse, &ldquo;194 while na might be regarded as just an affix 195 Asvins were originally divine horses and later became divine cavaliers PRZYLUSKI put forth two other suggestions in connection with the Vedic Great Goddess firstly, that, in the Vedic period, the Great Goddess and her attendants were sometimes represented under the form of a divine tree surmouoted by two birds,196 and, secondly, that, in the Vedic religion, as in the religion of Syria, the Great Goddess came to be transformed into the sun (Surya) He believed that the three stages of human evolution were the economic, the social, and the spiritual, and that, in the first stage, the Great Goddess was the Mistress of Animals, in the second, she became the wife of two men (an idea indirectly represented in the mythology of Aditi and Ašvins), and in the third, she became the wife of one husband (as suggested by the myth of Surya, the wife of the two Asyins, becoming the wife of one Soma) 107 A mention may be made in this context of another of PRZYLUSKI&rsquo;s propositions, namely, that Vedic Visnu, who had no counterpart in IE mythology, was to be connected with non Aryan Vith, a race living in Vethadipa in the Deccan 198

&ldquo;the most prolific as well as the most encyclopaedic. One may say without any fear of contradiction that in the two sumptuous volumes of The Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upani shads,199 KEITH provides ample evidence of his thorough acquain tance with almost everything that had been published on the subject till then. His genius, however, is essentially negative. His forte may be said to consist in trying to show how the theories advanced by other scholars are deficient. His own approach to the subject is usually unimaginative; his attitude is over-cautious - he shrinks from setting forth any positive views. His motto seems to have been : Confession of ignorance, however tantalizing, is better than assumption of knowledge. Notwith standing all this, it must be conceded that, in The Religion and Philosophy of the Veda and Upanishads, he has presented a very competent survey of all – or, almost all – existing knowledge about a wide range of topics relating to the Vedic religion and philosophy. In that book, he begins with a study of the sources, and then, in its four major divisions, he deals in great detail respectively with the gods and demons of the Veda, Vedic ritual, the spirits of the dead, and the philosophy of the Veda. In the Appendix, he takes up for critical discussion such topics as the age of the Avesta and RV, the sacrifice of Purusa and the origin of the world,200 the Aryan conception of the heaven,201 the drink of immortality,202 the IE fire-cult, cremation and burial, and the Dravidian element in Indian thought. KEITH&rsquo;s work thus constitutes a comprehensive digest on Vedism.203
So far as the Vedic mythology is concerned, KEITH is by no means a heretic - he is usually joclined to adhere to what are generally regarded as conventional veiws on the subject. Like BLOOMFIELD, he adopts, in this connection, the policy of &ldquo;wise

where the Aryans encountered the Austro-Asratic people and how the concept of Varuna came to be borrowed by the former from the latter And, finally, KEITH asks in his dominant mood of wise conservatism Is it not simpler to accept that Varuna is identical with Ourapos? He also argues that the development of Varuna the sky god into Varuna the sea god is quite natural in view of Varuna&rsquo;s connection with the waters of the heaven In spite of the new theories regarding the original characters of Pusan and Visnu,20- KEITH still sticks to the orthodox view that they are sun gods Aśvios are connected with patural phenomena.

occurrence of totemism in the Vedic religion cannot be denied But he hesitates to accept as convincing the evidence usually put forth in this connection, such as the names of tribes like Matsyas, Ajas, Māndūkeyas, and Vatsas, and the reference in the Salapatha Brāhmana to Kūrma (Kaśyapa ) being the father of the bumao race. At the same time, he believes, as against HILLEBRANDT, that traces of totemism may be seen in the selection or avoidance of certain animals for sacrifice In this connection, he quotes Pärashara Grhjasūtra III 11 10 which says &ldquo;At a sacrifice directed to a special deity, the animal belonging to that deity should be offered&rdquo; He concludes that “totemism merely accounts for the rare ceremonial eating of the slain god and not for the numerous instances of animal sacrifice found in early Vedic religion &quot; Totemism must have been 10 an advanced stage of decay wbea the practices in question were in vogue KEITH does not agree with HILLEBRANDT (and OLDENBERG aod HOPKINS) in his views regarding the difference between the Vedic conception of animal sacrifice and the Semitic conception He thinks that, while, according to both the conceptions, the animal is chosen because of its close connection with the god, and, in the actual sacrifice, it is filled with that god&rsquo;s divinity, the Indian does not see in the death of the victim the death of the god Similarly, the victim is not regarded as a close kis by the Indian sacrificer as by the Semitic As for human sacrifice, KEITH&rsquo;s view is that the Vedic Indians cannot have failed to practise a rite of which instances are found in many religions But it must have been a rare offering -“seldom, if at all, put 10 force&rdquo; So little notice is taken of it in ancient Indian literature According to KEITH, the sacrifice to Jumbaka on the head of a man of repulsive appearance is not a relic of the Vedic practice of slaying the aged and worn out king The man is clearly a scapegoat, and the purpose of the offering is to remove the guilt of the village outcastes KEITH considers the analogies between Vedic sacrifices and Greek mysteries208 to be precipitate About SCHROEDER&rsquo;s theory regarding mysteries and mimes in RV, he

J. CHARPENTIER was an ardent critic of the methods and most of the conclusions of KEITH,209 He was a confirmed anti naturalist. He beld that the moon was not impersonated in the austere and majestic figure of Varuna, nor was the sun the nature substratum of Vişnu. Indra was not the god of thunder or summer-heat; he was &ldquo;the heroic and somewhat grotesque chief of a flock of early knights-errant,&ldquo;210 who was, in course of time, transformed into their god by a &ldquo;rustic, semi-Domadic, strong, and half-barbarous people.” On the other hand, Varuna and Mitra must have originated in a society where law and order were regarded as particularly important. Varuna was the king in &ldquo;a well-ordered city-state.&rdquo; In a society which had not quite settled down, such a superhuman enforcer of law and order was bound to present a somewhat sinister aspect. This would account for the darker features of Varuna&rsquo;s character. The concepts of Varuna and Mitra implied a much higher civilization than the Indo-Iranian civilization. It was, therefore, not unlikely, accord ing to CHARPENTIER, that those two gods had been borrowed by the Indo-Icanians from some other people. As regards Asvins. CHARPENTIER accepted the view of the Aitihäsıkas and saw in those divinities two beneficent saviour-princes of yore. Furtber, he suggested that the mysterious qualities accorded to the smith in ancient tales might account for part of the character of Rbhus.212 It might be remembered that, in the IE period, a prominent position was generally assigned to the wainwright.

According to CHARPENTIER, the early and close connection between Rbhus and the Rathakāras could be taken as well esta blished Their rival was Tvastr, who presumably represented the old fashioned craftsmanship as against the new techniques evolved by Röhus CHARPENTIER understood the word apsaras in the sepse of &ldquo;body less,&rdquo; i form less&rdquo;, Apsaras was a being, who could, at her own sweet will, assume different forms In his noteworthy monograph Brahman,212 CHARPENTIER undertook a thorough, critical study of the concept of brahman from the linguistic, exegetical, and religio historical points of view He accepted HILLEBRANDT&rsquo;S proposition that the Vedic brahman and the Avestan barasian were closely related to each other and originally denoted a bunch of sacrificial grass 213 He then showed how that original conception of brahman later on developed in the directions of magical power, hymn or spell, and the ultimate principle of the universe Another noteworthy contribution of CHARPENTIER to the study of the Vedic mytho logy was Die Suparna-Sage 21€ In this monograph, CHAR PENTIER analysed the various motifs of the Suparna legend, and thereby also threw light on several problems connected with Indian legends in general

represented as an entirely independent god; he was only the instrument of rta.218 In RV, the concept of Varuna was simul taneously macrocosmic and microcosmic. Varuņa also became the extended cosmic representation of an earthly kingship. Further, according to HEIMANN, the idea of a primary mono theism was in no way reflected in RV. She thought that W. SCHMIDT&rsquo;s view that all polytheism was a distortion of an original Ur-gott - of original monotheism - was not valid for Vedic mythology.217 Similarly, pantheism&rsquo; or &lsquo;theopanism was not an adequate characterisation of the Vedic religion. HEIMANN sought to provide a philosophical rationalisation for Vedic henotheism.218 She also insisted that the henotheism of RV must be viewed together with the later concepts of ista devatā and bhakti. Her treatment of the supra-personal process of the Vedic sacrifice210 fits in well with her general conception of the ancient Indian Weltanschauung.
This longish survey may now be concluded with a brief reference to the work of some of the contemporary Western scholars. To begin with Georges DUMÉZIL, his basic dogma pertains to the tripartite ideology of the Indo-Europeans. According to DUMÉZIL, it is possible to deduce from a critical and comparative study of the oldest Indo-Iranian, Celtic, Italian, and Greek sources that the Indo-Europeans had the conception of a social structure based on the distinction and hierarchisation of three fuoctions, namely of priests, warriors, and producers, This conception gave rise to their tripartite mythology 220 DUMÉZIL divides the Aryan gods into three main classes - moral, military, and economic. So far as the Vedic religion and mytho logy are concerned, the two antithetical but complementary divine rulers Mitra and Varuna are the representatives of the first class,

Indra ( Or Vayu) of the second class and Asvins of the third class 2*1 As for Varuna, DUMÉZIL asserts that there is a very close affinity between Varuna and Ouranos - both linguistically and conceptually 22 The two words, varuna and ouranos, are to be derived from the root *uer which means to fasten,&rdquo; to bind. The idea of bondage is clearly expressed through the pašas of Varuna Bondage is a primary feature also of the character of Ouranos He is the master of the bond&rdquo; the fetterer of his foes Filial rivalry is common to both these mytho logies Ouranos as sovereign is threatened by his sons, while Varuna&rsquo;s son Bhrgu regards tumself as superior to his father 123 Another common point is the impotence brought upon these two gods In this connection, Ouranos was the victim of the machinations of his wife Gara and Kronos DUMÉZIL finds 11

practice.324 According to him, the word brahman is to be traced back to IE *blielgh, which had a religio-magical sense. Greek pharmakos and Latin flanien are also to be connected with *bhelgh. Thus brahman, like flamen, originally means a scape goat. DUMÉZIL contends that Brāhmanas achieved historical importance mainly as substitutes for the royal victim, who, according to the primitive belief, bad to be sacrificed for reviving life in nature. Kings were in the habit of majotaining men to act as substitutes during the periods of epidemics, famines, or other occasions for reviving the life of nature, when &quot; royal blood had to be spilled for public good.” Such men (Brahman. Brāhmanas ) were treated with formal deference, and would take part in the sacrificial offering of one of their number thereby acquiring a sombre prestige. DUMÉZIL adds that the magical conception of a scape-goat underwent a parallel development in India, Greece, and Rome. DUMÉZIL accounts for Varuna&rsquo;s close congection with waters in two ways: Varuņa is the guardian of the ritual order, and waters are a great ritual agency; that is why Varupa is so closely connected with waters. There is affinity between Varuna and waters also because both of them are responsible for fecundity in nature.
Mitra, says DUMÉZIL, is the Aryan god of contracts. He analyses the double sovereignty of Mitra-Varuna by pointing out that Mitra represents the clear, calm, benevolent, sacerdotal aspect while Varuna represents the assailant, sombre, ipspiring, violent, terrible, warlike aspect.225 Mitra is brahman, Varuņa is rāj.226 DUMÉZIL regards Aryaman as representing the third aspect of sovereignty.229 He emphasises the great similarity, both

the Vedic religion, a blend of ritual and mythology, each of which needs to be explained with the aid of the other. RENOU generally accepts the views of BERGAIGNE - he seems to be particularly in sympathy with the view that all mythological portrayals in the Veda are but variants of the sacred fire and the sacred drink.283 However, RV cannot be regarded as a mere ancillary to ritual. The function of sacrifice, says RENOU, Is to bring together all uncoordinated phenomena and build them up into an organic whole. He adds that the Upanisads carry the speculations of the Mantra and the Brāhmana to their logical conclusion. As for the relation between the Indus valley civilisa tion and the Vedic civilisation, RENOU suggests that one does not owe anything to the other. He, however, thinks that some form of Hinduism already existed in Vedic times (and certainly went back to the Indus valley civilisation) and that the esoterism of Taptra can be traced back to the Veda itself. Elsewhere RENOU has treated in some detail the Vedic god Indra.254 Referring to Indra&rsquo;s epithet vstrahan, he points out that, both in the Avestan and the Vedic mythology, Výtrahan originally repre sented the rather abstract concept of a god who destroyed resistances (vītrani) Later on, that god came to be absorbed by the hero Indra who had been transformed into a god. RENOU points out that, in the Atharvaveda, Indra is represented more concretely and in a more life-like manner.235

Like KEITH. Jan GONDA is a prolific and versatile writer on Vedism, having a firm command over an impressive array of bib liographical material; but, unlike KEITH, GONDA has a definite view-point of his own, which has oriented all his writings. He contends that &quot; for a more complete (or rather, a less incomplete) understanding of RV, a deeper understanding of primitive and semi-primitive culture, a deeper insight into the thought, inner life, religion, literature, etc., of the primitive man is necessary.&rdquo; For the primitive man, a close contact, a parallelism, a mutual influence between nature and the world of man are always extant. GONDA tries to illustrate this point by a detailed study of the Manduka-Sukta in RV (VII. 103 ).236 He thinks that it is wrong to speak of secular' hymns in RV, for, broadly speaking, there is nothing exclusively secular' or &lsquo;profane&rsquo; (in the modern sense of the words ) in RV. Io the Vedic society, characterised by the primitive aspects of the human mind and human culture, the religious - or, to be more precise, the magico-religious - element cannot be detached from other domains of human thought. GONDA ayers that, in Vedic times. religion' and magic' are inextricably interlaced. Accordingly, he emphasises the magico-religious significance of various Vedic concepts. For instance, he studies words like alamkāra and bhūsati and shows how they basically imply “magically causing one to become more complete, stronger, more beautiful, and more honour. able” or “investing with magical power.&rdquo; Speaking of the Purohita, GONDA says that the Purohita is so called because, like several divinities who are called purohita, he holds as shield in front of the person to be protected “the strength of the magical potence attaching to his own person.&rdquo; The sacrifi cial daksinā is by no means conceived as the salary or fee of the priest; rather, by paying it the sacrificer magically buys himself loose from the priest. According to GONDA, religious festivals (and sacrifices ) were the means employed by the primitive man to simulate or resuscitate the vital powers of nature. This can

be seen from the original sense of the word utsava 237 GONDA has similarly stressed the magico-religious significance of many other words and concepts like guru, miya, pratisthā, and amhas. Subjecting to a critical examination all the carlier views about brahman,23he concludes that the potion behind brahman is that of a vast but not unspecific power of support and foundation, which in the speech of the Vedic priest-poets was especially articulated as “ritual, sacred, or magical utterance.&rdquo;
. lo his Aspects of Early Vişnuism,219 GONDA discusses the question of how Visou, who had held a subordinate position in the Rgvedic pantheon, came to be elevated to supreme godhead in the later mythology. In that connection he considers such separate topics as Visnu and fertility, Vişou and Indra, Vişnu aod sajra, Visnu and the mountains, Visnu and yūpa, and Visgu and Logship, pinpointing those characteristics of the Vedic deity &ldquo;which have persisted and reached maturity in the subsequent period and which enable us to gain an insight into those factors which helped, or even predisposed, him to gain the high position which he occupies 10 Hinduism.&rdquo; He points out that the ancient Indian views regarding Visnu show a remarkable' degree of consistency, and that the two most prominent characteristics of Visou are his &quot; pervasiveness” and his identification with sacrifice. In the course of his discussion, GONDA has made several points of religio-historical significance. For instance, he says that one cannot deny the existence of a form of worship among the Vedic Aryans or characterise it as autochthonous because RV is silent about it. Similarly, an Aryan, Austric, or Dravidian name does not necessarily indicate a religious cult of exclusively Aryan, Austric, or Dravidian origio The existence of a particular god

or cult among the primitive non-Aryan tribes docs not exclude the possibility of an independent evolution of a similar god of cult within the original Aryan community. The nature of Vedic Agni forms one of the many subiccts treated in GONDA&rsquo;s Some Obsenations on the Relations between Gods and Powers.240 With reference to Agai&rsquo;s epithet sahasah sūnuh, GONDA suggests that, by establishing a filial relationship between an entity and a power, the entity in question becomes a representative of that power - it actually becomes that power.**1 He further suggests that the designation of Agni as &lsquo;son&rsquo; may be connected with the concep tion that the churning out of the fire represents a sexual act. GONDA&rsquo;s recent publication, Dle Religionen Indiens 1: Veda und alterer Hinduismus, 212 may be said to contain a conspectus of his typical views regarding the Vedic religion and mythology. In the first four chapters of this treatise, the author presents an illumi. nating and thought-provoking survey of the religious ideology of the Veda, 243 under such headings as the Veda, Brāhmanas, and Powers, the Gods, the Rites, and the Religious and Philosophical Speculations.

<p>Manas is the buman faculty which is usually associated in the Veda with a variety of psychological activities. The considera tion of the genesis of the Vedic concept of manas brings forth a number of unique characteristics of that human faculty. Let us first approach the question of the origin of the concept of manas from the linguistic point of view. It is believed by some scholars that the words, manas, manus, manyu, mensch, mann, etc., are derived from the Indo-European (IE) root men- which has the sense of thinking', &lsquo;mental activity&rsquo;, etc. The possibility is thereby suggested of the notion of man as a thinking being', having been prevalent even in a very remote period. The anthro pological investigations have, however, led to a doubt as to whether the proposed etymology is correct. The idea of man as a thinking being', as against beasts and other creatures who are supposed to have been denied the faculty of thinking, cannot possibly have prevailed in that age. The primitives generally did not believe in any kind of essential differentiation among the several aspects of creation, whose existence was, according to them, wholly dependent upon a universal all-penetrating magic fluid like Aronda or the Vedic asu.? It was the amount of such magic fluid, and not the possession or non-possession of any special mental or physical faculties, that determined the gradation among the beings io the universe.
There is another fact to be noted in this connection. A fair kuowledge of the human anatomy on the part of the IE people has given rise to a large number of words denoting several parts of the human body, which are to be found in many IE languages and which are linguistically connected with one another. It may be further observed that the words, in several IE languages, de poting' sensations', &lsquo;emotions, and other such non-physical (or</p>

psychological) phenomena are connected with the names of bodily organs. Io Homeric language, for instance, zred, zreues, prapides (connected with diaphragm ) denote almost all the varieties of will, thought, understanding, ctc. Further it is not unlikely that the words khólos (anger), kérdos ( advice, gaio); and kerdosúne (cunning, will) are connected with hardla (heart). In later Greek, the entrails seem to be regarded as the seat of feelings and sensations (cf. dplankuizomai). The Latin words, vecors ( wrong-sensed ), recordari ( remember ), etc., indi cate that those faculties were again connected with cor, cordis (heart). In the Slavonic languages, particularly in Russian anger and excitement are associated with liver. These linguistic facts show that many words denoting non-physical or &lsquo;psychod logical phenomena &lsquo;were derived in most IE languages from the names of different bodily organs. They were not at all connected with manas or its linguistic counterparts in other languages. The association of manas with human psychology is, therefore, clearly an afterthought.
How then are the words manas, manus, etc., to be derived, It may be suggested that these words can be regarded as having originally been loan-words in IE; they are the IE counterparts of the primitive word mana, which denoted the universally pero meating magic fluid which, according to the primitive notions, made all beings what they were. This fluid mana was further supposed to have been capable of bestowing upon beings some kind of Occult power which made them men&rsquo;. It may, there. fore, be assumed that the words manas, manus, man, mensch, etc., have come into existence as the result of the influence of prim. tive thought. Those words did not originally denote exclusively psychological or non-material notions. Manas, for instance, did not originally denote what we today call “mind&rsquo; — that was a later modification of the original conception &mdash; but it denoted a comprehensive all-penetrating fluid or magic potence like mana of the primitives. Manas was, therefore, regarded as being as much</li>

• material&rsquo; in nature as mana. This original notion about manas, as a form of matter, has becn preserved, to a considerable extent, in the Vedic literature, even after manas came to denote human mind. It is this phenomenon in Vedic psychology which I have called Somatism of Vedic Psychology
IO RV II, 12. 1, Indra is called manasian. This cpithet does not indicate, in this context, the possession on the part of Indra of any special mental' power, The poet presumably wants to counterbalance manasan Indra - Indra who possesses large quantity of manas-substance &ndash; with asura Varuna - Varuna who possesses large quantity of asu-substance'. The words nanasyu (as in RV X. 171.3) ( one desirous of manas-sub. stance') and nianasaspati (as in AV VII. 97, 8) (one who com. mands any amount of manas-substance) are also to be explain ed as belongiog to the original' mana-manas-conception'. Other significant passages, in this connection, are to be found in the funeral hymns, e. g., RV X. 57.3,5; AV VIII, 1, 7; 2.3. In all these passages, manas suggests a dualism with the physical body not in the sense of &lsquo;cogitatio&rsquo; and &lsquo;extensio&rsquo;, but in the sense of a. potence-bestowing substance and its substratum'. The loss of manas (not evidently in the sense of mind, but in its ori ginal sense of mana-potence) results in virtual death. It is, again, in its original sense, that the Vedic poet speaks of the bestowal of manas on beings (RV X. 57. 3-5). A critical comparison of such references to manas in the Rgveda (particularly as in X. 57 and 58 ) with the references to manas in its modified form us, for instance, in Vajasaneyi-Samhitā 34 would clearly bring out the distinction between the two notions denoted by the word manas in the Vedic literature. In the former we have the original mana-manas-concept', while the latter passage consti. tutes one of the finest descriptions of the faculties of the human &lsquo;minds</li>
<li>How the concept of manas as &lsquo;mind&rsquo; evolved from the primitive * mana-manas concept&rsquo; is an interesting problem of Vedic psychology. Its consi. deration is, however, beyond the scope of this paper,
SOMATISM OF VEDIC PSYCHOLOGY

The fact that manas originally represented some form of material substance is amply corroborated by the Vedic descrip tions of the several activities of manas. Manas is often repre sented as being capable of such modifications as are usually asso ciated with matter. Manas is, for instance, considered to be capable of movement in space. It is always said to be moving from place to place. No function of manas is possible without some movement on its part. There are prayers in the Rgveda for manas to move in a particular direction and come nearer to the poet : dejāsas cin manasā san hi jagmuh (III. 1. 13), prācinena manasa barkaņāvarā (1. 54, 5), anăcinar su te mano grāvā krnotu vagnuna (I. 84.3). The idea of motion or movement implied in the functioning of manas can also be derived from such passages as mano dânāja codayan (VIII. 99, 4), blad. rar no api vātaja manah (X, 20.1), parā hi me vimanyavah patanti vasyaiştaye (I. 25. 4). Incidentally, it may be pointed out that the notion of manas leaving its substratum, viz., the physical body, and going forth to the object of comprehension has developed into a remarkable feature of the later Iodian epic stemology. Modern science holds that the external objects, in the form of light-rays etc. issuing from them, go up to the human senses. Some ladian theories of knowledge, on the other hand, maintain that manas and indriyas go forth to the objects of per ception and conception. This doctrine is known as indrlyäņām prāpyakārita.</li>
</ol>
<p>A similar feature of manas is indicated when the poet speaks of turning the manas of the divinity : nū indra rāye varivas krdhi na ā te mano vavrtyāma maghāya ( VII, 27.5). Further, there are references to the placing' of manas : Ive pito mahānan devānām mano hitam (I. 187.6), mano jatrā vı tad dadluh (VIII. 13, 20). There are also references to the yoking' or directing' of manas : yuñjate mano dīnāya (1, 48.4), inanaso na prayuktısu (1.151.8), apo acchā manaso na prayuktih (X, 30. 1). A more intensive form of such an idea, which is clearly indicative of the material nature of manas, is suggested by the grasping' of and by manas: svene &lsquo;ra dhiro manasă yad agrabhit (I. 145.2). Further, manas

EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
is described as beiog controlled &lsquo;, .bound down&rsquo;, driven from afar&rsquo;, etc. (VIII. 11.7).
The Vedic poets further speak of the tcasion' of manas &ndash; another feature which indicates that mianas was regarded as a material substance'. It could be &quot; loosened&rdquo; or &ldquo;unyoked&rdquo; like a horse which had been yoked : vi mrlikāja le mano rashir aśvani na sandutant / girbhir varuna simahl (I. 25. 3). Manas becomes hard and can be &lsquo;softened&rsquo; : paneś cid vi mrada manah (VI. 53 3). In such passages, there is a clear indication of the Vedic conception of manas being capable of thickening' or solidification Manas biods. down others (I. 164. 37) and can itself be bound down by external forces (1. 138. 1) Manas is said to shake through fear (X. 121.6). There is further a reference to the churning of manas : eva malhnami Te manah (AV II. 30, 1), as well as to controlling' or &lsquo;disci. plining&rsquo; it (VIII. 33. 17). The functions and the activities of manas are so described in the Veda that thereby manas is actually represented as being a &lsquo;material substance&rsquo; and its activities as actual modifications in the nature and position of that sub. stance. The word päka employed in connection with manas (VII. 104, 8; X. 2. 5; 114.4) also brings forth prominently the somatic' nature of manas, Manas was regarded as a kind of &lsquo;matter&rsquo; which was subject to being &lsquo;ripened&rsquo; or &lsquo;cooked&rsquo;. Such descriptions may not be explained away as mere imaginative or poetical representations of the activities of manas. They clearly betray the original somatic' nature of manas. Manas must have been regarded as a kind of material substance', and its activities were, therefore, necessarily described as mechanical and dynamic modifications of that substance'.</p>
<p>This feature of Vedic psychology is seen to have persisted even in later literature. The Chandogja-Upanişad declares that for its formation manas is dependent upon alimentation, Manas &lsquo;is said to have originated out of the food that we eat : annamajam hi somya manah (Ch. Up. VI, 5. 4; 6. 1-2). Though most of the later Indian systems of philosopby, with the exception of the Carvãkas who believe that consciousness&rsquo; originates as the result of the gross material clements comiag together, regard citla or vijñana as somcthing peculiarly psychical, it must be remembered that the pature and thic activities of cilta are represented by themi a&rsquo;s if it was a material substance. Even later Indian psychology is thus primarily somatic. in character. Such is the case parti cularly of the Buddhist and the Yoga psychological teachings. In Abhidhanıma, for example, all clements arc graded according to their grossness — from the grossest carth to the subtlest soul matter. The Buddhist psychologists speak of six dhātus and five skandlas, which terms again betray their somatic naturc. All consciousness-phenomena, like fechags, emotions, perception and conception, knowledge, etc., arc regarded in the Yoga merely as disturbances in or modifications of tlic psychical substancc. According to the Yoga-psychology, manas is parinām), that is to say, it is constantly suffering a thousand modifications. The teras vptti and prayiti arc cicarly indicative of this feature. Vitti means the activity of an object; praytii means the going forward of the citra towards its object. Dhirana means litcrally the binding of citta to the desired object; dhyāna is explained as the homogc. Deity of the stream of consciousness. The stream of consciousness is not a metaphorical imagery but it is a real slow of the waves of citla. The first type of disturbance' in the psychical matter is, from the somatic&rsquo;standpoint, that of movement, vibration or oscillation'. The second type is that of solidification or thickea. ing', which is indicated by the gradation made by the Buddhists - yathaudārikam- of the four psychological skandhas, namely vijñana, samiskära, vedanā, and sarijñā. The third type of dis. turbances in the soul-matter is that of defilement or affliction'. This is indicated by the notions of klesa, asrava, and prasāda. According to the bhāşya on Yogasūtra II. 11, cilla, when defiled and amicted through klesa, is to be treated in the same manncr as a dirty cloth. The Yogācåra school of Buddhism, represented by Maitreya Asanga, believes in the divisibility of citta. All these conceptions in later lodian psychology clearly remind one of the descriptions of manas and its activities in the early Vedic litc. rature,</p>
<h2 id="hrd-in-vedas">hRd in vedas</h2>
<p>Another current of thought also is associated with the notion of hrd. A study of certain words in Gk, Lat, etc., possessing psychological significance, such as phren, phrénes, kérdos, vecors, recordari, proves that the human faculties of feeling, willing, etc, were connected by the people speaking those languages more parti cularly with the heart. The same feature is to be noticed in the Veda also, It is obviously on account of certain distinctive features of hrd, such as its being the innermost as well as the most vital and the most sensitive organ in the human body, that certain primary psychological functions have come to be connected with it. Primi tive thinking does not seem to have countenanced any abstract conceptions. Whatever is real must be, according to the primitive thought, concrete and substantial. So the psychological experi ences also were associated by the primitive man with concrete physical organs And the bodily organ, which was particularly .affected by such experiences as fear, anger, hatred, longing, love, etc.,,was evidently the heart in this manner the heart became the starting point of early psychological speculations. In what may be called the pre-analytical stage of Vedic psychology, side by side with hrd, manas also played a similar role and that too in a more or less material form 3 Several psychological ex. -periences and functions had come to be related to manas. 1 would, however, seem that, when manas was later conceived as the human faculty connected with certain specific psychological (functions, such as sankalpa, the Vedic poet began to lay greater stress upon the original association of hrd and the primary psy ichological experiences. In such cases hrd may be said to have been regarded rather as a psychological faculty than as a mere physical organ. The association of hrd and hurdaya with manas (RV, VII, 98. 2; VIII, 100.5), dhi and manisi (RV. I. 61.21 would confirm this assumption It is from this point of view that a few characteristics of hrd as constituting an element of the human personality will be described in this paper. For, the role of hrd in human life as represented in the Veda is, as is perhaps

quite natural, essentially psychological. But,' for the sake of a clear understanding of this entire conception, the significant deve lopment in the notion of hrd, broadly outlined above, should not be lost sight of
In the so-called analytical stage of Vedic psychology híd seems to have been distinguished from manas in that it then camc to be regarded as the basis of all spontaneous psychological ex periences. All such psychological phenomena as do not require any sort of positive effort for their manifestation are normally connected with hrd. &lsquo;Fear&rsquo;, for instance, is said to enter into the heart (RV I. 32. 14); elsewhere it is spoken of as being placed in the heart (RV X. 84.7; AV IV. 31.7). Similarly one finds that desire is spoken of as having its roots in the heart (RV X. 40. 12). A Vedic poet says that Agni knows their hearts : asmaddhirdo blūrijanmā yi casļe (RIX. 5.1). Siyana, in his commentary, explains lidah as hrdayāni, that is to say, abhilaşitāni : asmakam hrdayāni abhilasilani jānālt. Incidentally, we clearly observe here a peculiarity of the Veda, pamely that a human faculty itself is made to represent its own function. The &ldquo;longing' on the part of a person is manifested in his heart (RV X. 123. 6). The feelings of pleasure' and satisfaction spring from the heart (RV I.43.1; VIII.43.31; AV XX, 87.2). Soka, in the same manger, burns the heart (RV X. 103. 12; AV VI. 18. 1; XIX 28.2), or the heart is said to be free from, torment' (AV XVI. 3. 6) The Vedic poet refers to himself, in another sepse, as invoking Indra with a burning heart : yar tvà hrda focatā johanim (AV 11. 12. 3). The words, Liriñã hrdā (RV V.4 10), suggest, according to GRASSMANN, the feeling of grati tude. It will be thus seen that, in all these cases, the sponta neity of the psychological phenomena is suggested through their association with hrd.
Besides spontaneity', the association of the psychological phenomena with hrd also signifies their sincere,'' spiritual,' and inspired character ( AV I. 60.3; 116. 17). It should be noted

in this connection that, in the Veda, lird is often considered to be the proper fountain of song. The Vedic mantra springs directly from the heart of the poet (RV 1. 60.3). In one Vedic passage, Indra is implored to accept such a song, which goes up to bim, in all exuberance of sincere and spontaneous feelings and emotions, like a beloved to her lover (RV III. 39, 1). In another passage, the streams of poetry are described as flowing out of the ocean of the heart : etā arsanti hrdyāt samudrät (RV IV. 58, 5). The heart is the ocean from out of which the genuine feelings of a Soma-inspired poet flow forth. According to the Vedic poet, the seat of genuine poetical inspiration is the heart. Indeed, in RV III. 26. 8 a Vedic poet seems to have succinctly set forth the whole process of the origin of a truly inspired song. First of all there flashes a light (jyotih: inspiration ). It touches the poet&rsquo;s heart. The seed of the song thus sown begins to sprout with all the spontaneity, sincerity, and spirituality associated with hrd (hrdā anu prajānan). The words in which that song (arka) is to be formulated are then made to pass through the threefold sieve of inner thought (tribhih pavitraih apupot) so that they may ultimately spring forth as a properly refined, well thought out, and well wrought prayer (mati).? It is directly from hrd that the poet addresses the divinity: hrdā hūyanta ukthinah ( RV VIII, 76,8).
Not only does the Vedic song originate from hrd but its appeal too is directed towards hrd. It is in this sense that the Vedic song is often said to be hrdısprś (RV I. 16.7; X. 47. 7). It ought to go directly to the heart of the divinity (RV VII. 101,5). It must also lie within the heart : hrdi stoma upaśrilas cid astu (RV VIII. 86,8). The Vedic song, indeed, forms the
5. In this connection one may recall the Wordsworthian conception of poetry as the spontancous overflow of powerful feelings. Such poetry may ba distinguished from the vaco mali (RV I. 143 1) type of poetry, in which a cons cious effort is made, as by a laksa' a carpenter', to put the best words in the best order and thus to make the prayer a sunku, a well wrought song.

bridge between the heart of the poet and the heart of the divinity and thus brings about the true communion between the two. It should be noted that an interesting commingling of ideas on the part of the Vedic poet occurs in this connection. Like stoma, Soma also is called hrdisprš (RV X, 25, 2),for, it is said to enter into the depths of hrd ( RV III, 42. 8, IX. 60. 3; 108. 16). It is not only in this respect that Soma is similar to stoma, the Vedic song. Just as the Soma-juice is pressed out and purified three times ( RV IX. 73. 8), so too is the Vedic song purified and perfected through the functioning of hrd and manas : samyak sravanti sarito na dhenā antar hrda manasā pūyamānah (RV IV. 58.6: also cf. III. 26 8) Soma is often referred to as pouring into and reposiog in the heart (RV I. 91. 13; 168, 3; 179.5; VIII. 2. 12; 48. 12) From out of the heart spring forth the in spired songs of the Vedic poet. These two notions seem to have merged into one another. The Vedic poet, therefore, represents the origin of the song in terms of the stream of Soma (ghrta. dhārāk) flowing out of the ocean of the heart (RV IV. 58. 5; also cf. IV. 58 11; X 5.1; 89.4). This conception of Vedic poetry originating from the heart of the poet and having a direct appeal to the heart of the divinity would clear up a common mis understanding about its nature, namely, that Vedic poetry is often purely conventional in form and content.
According to the early Indian thinkers, true comprehension lies not in indirectly knowing' a thing, but in directly feeling' it. The Vedic poet seems to express this idea when he suggests that true comprehension appears in hrd Through the light' of hrd, there dawned upon Sunahấepa the true knowledge of the nature and function of Varuna : 1ad ayam keto hrda ā vi coste (RY 1.24.12). In another passage (RV V. 31.9), darkness is said to have been driven away from the heart. Another striking passage (RV VII.

It will be seen from the foregoing brief statement regarding the salient features of hrd and its functions that the original notion about hrd was greatly influenced in the Veda by other psychologi cal concepts, particularly by the manas concept It would, there fore, be interesting to note in this connection the main features which characterise the relation between hrd and manas in the Veda To begin with, it appears that the word hrd is connected with manas, in certain passages, more or less as an adjective Thus the word hrd seems to qualify, to a certain extent, the functions of manas The phrase hrda manasa occurs more than once in RV in one context, RV X 177 1, Sayana rightly explains hrda manasā as antarmukhena manasa The ideas of spontaneity, sincerity, spirituality, introspection, true knowledge, etc, which are usually associated with hrd are thus brought into contact with the function of manas A specific type of think ing' is here indicated by the addition of the word hird In another context (RV VI 28 5), Sayana again suggestively ex

plains the phrase hrdā manasā as Sraddhāyuklena manasā. The distinction between the two concepts of hird and manas implied here is that manas represents the faculty of thinking-of reason, while hrd represents the faculty of feeling-of faith'. The real intellectual approach towards anything should be, according to the Vedic poet, one characterised both by reason and faith. A linguistic study of the words meaning &lsquo;heart&rsquo; in the cognate IE languages would show that, properly speaking, the Vedic equi valent of the original IE word *kered, *kred, should have been Śrd. In its place, lird, which is merely a Iliyme-word, has actually been preserved. It seems, however, that śrd also has been re tained in Vedic in another form, viz , śrad. The Vcdic verb śrad v dha, which corresponds with IE kred dhē, literally means &lsquo;to put one&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;, that is, to believe, have faith'. The man Der, in which that verb is used in šrad asınai dhatta (RV II, 12,5) makes it clear that srad must have been used as an independent word, obviously in the same sense asi hrd 12

· The Vedic poet tries to express the distinction between the human faculties of hrd and manas and their respective functions in several ways. One passage (RV VIII, 100, 5) is particularly illuminating in this connection. Indra explains the reason for his sudden appearance on the earth. When he sat alone, upon the back of the much sought after (sky)', there entered in him a feeling of urgent anxiety. He wondered why such a feeling should bave originated Thereupon an inner voice told him that his devoted singers were invoking him, and so he came down to the earth. This entire psychological process on the part of Indra has been very picturesquely described by the Vedic poet. The heart is, as we have seen so far, the human faculty which is usu ally the seat of “ feelings'. Manas, on the other hand, is the human faculty which is responsible for positive thinking'. In this particular psychological experience of Indra, his lid could

&lsquo;feel&rsquo; something, but it was unable to find out the real cause of that feeling. As a matter of fact, the function of hrd ended with the feeling. Indra, therefore, brought into action his other psy chological faculty, pamely, manas. His manas investigated into the nature of the feeling which arose in his hrd and supplied, so to say, the answer to the query of hrd: manas cin me hrda a pratyavocad acıkradan chi sumantah sakhayah. It is manas which, on account of its main function of positive thinking, completes the whole psychological process by supplementing the psychologi cal experience of hrd. Thereafter follows the &lsquo;doing&rsquo;, namely, Indra&rsquo;s appearance before his devotees. This passage is remark able also from another point of view. It throws considerable light on the Vedic thinker&rsquo;s conception of the three most primary phases of human action, namely, feeling, knowing, and doing.
A similar functional distinction between the two human faculties, hrd and manas, seems to be suggested in a passage from AV (VI. 73. 2), where the poet refers to hrdaya as the seat of
vehement feelings in contrast to manas which is supposed to be the seat of conscious designs':30 vah fusnio hrdayesy anlar akūtir jā jo manasi pravistă. The twofold conception of Vedic poetry, firstly as an outburst of the exuberance of feelings directly springing from hrd, and secondly as a conscious artistic effort, in the manner of a taksā, an artisan, to put the best words in the best order, often connected with manas, also make the distinc tion between the nature and functions of hard and manas quite clear. Such primary analysis of psychological functions is not an uncommon phenomenon in the Veda (cf. RV I. 61. 2; X. 10. 13; 123. 6).
Finally, we fiad in the Veda the beginnings of the later view regarding the relation between hird and manas. In AV XIX. 9.5, hrd is clearly referred to as the abode of manas and other indriyas. The reference is important from two points of vicw. Firstly, it appears from this reference that in later Veda manas came to be regarded as one of the indriyas, though still the most essential, that is to say, mcrcly as one of the several constituents of the

human personality;12 and, secondly, hrd gradually came to lose its essentially psychological import.

<p>THE MAHABHARATA : ORIGIN AND GROWTH
In the history of Indological studies there has been evident a tendency to exaggerate the importance of the Vedic Aryan element in India&rsquo;s culture-complex According to this school of thought the Veda has made the greatest contribution to the moulding of the Indian way of life and thought through the ages As a matter of fact, ancient Indian culture, or, more precisely, the Hindu culture, as a whole, is not infrequently characterised as Vedic culture Even a casual survey of the Hindu way of life and thought would, however, lay bare the inadequacy of such a characterisation The principal gods of the Vedic pantheon, such as Indra and Varuna, are now no longer worshipped, their place has long since been taken by the gods of the people, like Visou and Rudra Siva Mythology and demonology other than those of the Veda have been ushered in and now cater to the instinctive demands of the people in connection with what may be called the embellishment and ornamentation of religion. The elaborate system of sacrifice, which had been evolved and consolidated dur jog the Brāhmana period and resuscitated and reorganised during the Sūtra period and which had come to be recognised almost as the hallmark of the Vedic religious practice, has now become well nigh extinct. The profound philosophical speculations of the Upanısads, which were once regarded as the last word in the field of mysticism and spiritualism, have either undergone vital modi. fications or have been cotirely superseded by other systems of thought The fastidious rules governing man&rsquo;s personal, domes tic, and social life, prescribed by the Sūtras, have given way to a Dew ethical code In short, the ideals sponsored by the Veda have long since ceased to operate as the exclusive motive force so far as the Indian way of life and thought are concerned There. forc, the claim that no litcrary work has influenced and still conti. nucs to influencc India&rsquo;s cultural life to such a remarkable extent As the Veda can be regarded as hardly warranted It has to be

realised that Brahmanism of the Veda has long since disappeared, and Hinduism, which traditionally claims to have derived its inspiration from the Veda but which, historically speaking, bas actually assimilated within itself perhaps more non-Vedic elements than the Vedic ones, has become the dominaot force in the socio religious life of India. And the literary works, which have left an abiding imprint on the socio-religious life sponsored by Hinduism, are not so much the Veda as the popular epics.
Even, among these popular epics, if there is any one single work which has proved to be of the greatest significance in the mak ing of the life and thought of the Indian people and whose tradi tion continues to live even to this day and influenee, in one way or another, the various aspects of Indian life, it is the Mahābhārata, the great national epic of India. Men and women in India from one end of the country to the other, whether young or old, whether rich or poor, whether high or low, whether simple or sophisticated, still derive enlightenment, entertainment, inspira tion, and guidance from the Mahābhārata. In times of stress and trial, the Mahābhārata has given consolation and brought a message of hope as much to an illiterate villager as to an experi enced statesman, Indian writers, ancient and modern, have found in the stories of the great epic excellent vehicles for the expression of their creative genius. If we were to consider, for instance, the popular folk-songs, or the ballads sung by itinerant bards, or the well-known literary works written in various Indian languages by eminent men of letters, we would find that many of these had drawn their inspiration and material from the Mahābhārata. There is, indeed, no department of Indian life, public or private, which is not vitally influenced by the great epic. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the people of India have learnt to think and act in terms of the Maltābhārata.
The Mahābhārata is, indeed, a unique phenomenon in the literary history not only of India but of the world. Just consider its extent. The Mahabharata, as we know it today, consists of 1,00,000 stanzas. It is thus by far the biggest single literary work known to man. A comparative statement would, perhaps, make
264
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
the enormity of the work more patent. The Mahabharata is eight times as big as Homer&rsquo;s Illiad and Odyssey put together; it is, indeed, bigger than all the epic poems in European languages put together. The tradition about the various forms in which the Mahābhārata is known to have existed, as mentioned in the epic itself, is still more astounding. We are told that the great Vyäsa produced the Mfahābharata consisting of six million stanzas. Of these six million, three million are recited among the gods, one an half million among the pilars, one million and four lacs among the Gandharvas, and the remaining 1,00,000 have been assigned to the earth for the human beings. The mythical character of this tradition apart, there is no doubt that it contains some indications regarding the history of the text of the Mahābhārata. This much at least can be safely assumed on the strength of that tradition, namely, that, in its long course, the literary activity, which even tually gave rise to the great epic, was characterised by the processes both of compression and expansion. At this stage, attention may be incidentally drawn to another remarkable feature of the Mahābhārata In spite of its vast extent, the epic does not give the impression of being a motley mass piled up together. Without dilating upon the Mahābhārata as a piece of literary art, one can say with conviction that, on a closer study, one finds .the epic, as a whole, presenting a surprisingly well-balanced and harmonious structure.
But it is not only its size that entitles the Mahābhārata to the claim of uniqueness. Its contents too are unique in many rese pects. Even a casual reader of the Mahābhārata would be struck by its essentially encyclopaedic character. Indeed, it may be said to be embodying almost all knowledge about Indian religion and mythology, law, ethics and philosophy, statecraft and art of war, and history and ethnology, which had been current in that epocb. Vyāsocchistam jagat sarvam: There is no subject under the sun which the versatile Vyasa, the traditionally recognised author of the epic, has not tackled, The Mahābhārata constitutes a very</p>

comprehensive historical record of a large slice of India&rsquo;s past-a record which, to boot, is prepared with a marvellous insight into the lives of men and women belonging to all strata of society: In a truly cinematographic fashion, the epic unfolds, through reels after reels, as it were, the moving picture of the cultural life as lived by the people of India through centuries. The name, Mahābhārata, is explained in the epic itself as follows: mahattrad bhāratatvāc ca mahābhāratam cyate. Whatever the true inten. tion of the author, the strikiog character of the epic tempts me to interpret this verse-half as: This epic is called Mahābhārata on account of its mahariva (that is, its enormous size) and its bharatatja (that is, its essential. Indianness). None could have brought out this Indianness' of the epic in a more telling manner than that versatile German Indologist, OLDENBERG, who has declared that in the Mahābhārata breathe the united soul of India, and the individual souls of her people.' In the fullest sense of the term, therefore, the Mahābhārata can be said to be the national saga of India. It is, indeed, no wonder that the Indians should have raised the cpic to the status of the fifth Veda (bhāratam pañcamo veda!) and thus invested it with the sanctity and authority of the four Vedas. As a matter of fact, the verse-half about the name, Mahabharata, which has been quoted above, is, through a clever pun, sometimes, read as : malaltiad bhāravattvāc ca mahābhāratam ucyate. It is thereby perhaps suggested that the Mahābhārata actually outweighs the Veda and other sacred writings of India.
But the appeal of the Mahābhārata is not merely Indian or national; it is essentially human or universal. A proud claim is made on behalf of the epic:

How must have this unique work-vast in extent, encyclo paedic in character, and universal in appeal-come into being ? Prima facie it would appear that the Mahābharata could not have been the creation of ope author or eyen of one generation of authors With reference to it, therefore, one has to speak in terms not of creation but of growth The suggestion that the epic is the outcome of a long and continual literary activity 15, however, by no means acceptable to all critical students of the epic. There is, for instance, the view of Rev DAHLMANN.&rdquo; According to DAHLMANN, who, incidentally, is one of the most prolific critical investigators of the Mahabharata problem, it is quite unnecessary to speak of the different layers of the composi tion of the epic, because it can be proved that the epic belongs to one single stratum It will be seen, asserts that scholar, tbat, in spite of its general prolixity and of the fact that didactic digressions and irrelevant episodes often break the continuity of its main story, there is in the epic a striking unity of characterisation lo other words, the author of the epic does not ever lose sight of

the main argument. The feud between the Kauravas and the Pāņdavas, which forms the central theme of the poem, is accord. ing to DAHLMANN, not historically authentic. Had it been so, some traces of it would certainly have been preserved also else where in Indian history. It would appear that the main purpose of the author was didactic&ndash;that is to say, to present the conflict between Good and Evil and to emphasize that Good would in the end prevail over Evil. As an adequate vehicle for this didactic teaching, the poet has spun out a story from the ancient epic material relatiog to the Kurus and the Pandavas. DAHLMANN eventually concludes that the Mahābhārata presents itself as a unified work, that, in it, two elements—the didactic and the epic -have been artistically welded together, that this welding together of the didactic and the epic elements has been conceived and worked out by a sipgle jospired poet, and, finally, that all this must have been accomplished not later than the Sth century B. C.
It may be incidentally stated here that, even before DAHL MANN&rsquo;s time, SORENSEN, the eminent compiler of the famous Mahābhārata Index, had, in 1883, spoken of the oldest form of the Mahābhārata, which, according to him, must have been of the nature of a saga, as having represented a unified whole. BARTH, who has subjected to a critical examination the views of several Mahābhārata scholars, also finally pronounces the judgement that the epic can lay claim to being an upmistakably uniform work. If, according to SÖRENSEN, the factor, which invests the epic with a unity, is the ancient saga of the Kurus, according to Sylvain LEVI, it must have been some didactic teaching such as the one which is embodied in what later came to be known as the Bhagavadgita.? Sylvaio LÉVI characterises the Bhagavadgiia as constitutiog a Kşatriya code of conduct based on the religious ideology of the Bhāgavatas. The central purpose of the poem is, according to that scholar, to rally together the Ksatriyas in the</li>

service of Lord Krsna. With a ricw, then, to convincing the Ksatriyas that the scrvicc of Krona is, indeed, the true guarantec of their success and welfarc, &amp; Bhāgavata poct must have woven round the Bliagavadgitū thc cpic tale of the Kauravas and the Pandavas
OLDENBERG has characterised all such attempts at discoser. ing in the Malabharata a unified and harmonious whole-more or less justifiably but rather in strong terms&ndash;as constituting * scientific monstrosity&hellip; When, for instance, DAULMANN speaks of the unmistakable unity of characterisation in the epic, one can hardly persuadc oneself to accept that claim. There are, in the Nahābhārata, certain obvious inconsistensies, both pertainjog to the story and the characterisation, which would remain unci. plained in case of the assumption of the unified authorship of the work. Again, if the central purpose of the Malabhārata had really been to induct the Ksatriyas in the service of Lord Krsna, the single poet, who is averred to have been the author of the epic, would have taken care not to represent Krsna in a dual character. Further, it is, indeed, strange that, in this unified poem, in which didactic teaching is claimed to have been presented in the garb of an epic with a view to propagating that teaching among the people at large, there should have been glaring discrepancies between the theory of law and ethics, which must have been sought to be taught, and their practice as manifested through the persons and events in the story. And, finally, may we pot ask how one single author could have been as he is actually seen to be in the Mahābhārala-at once a great poet and a miserable bungler, a wise sage and a weak-beaded simpleton, a genial artist and a droll pedant? How could he bave sponsored mutually opposing systems of religion and philosophy? It may also be pointed out that, if DAILMANN&rsquo;s date of the epic-poem were to be accepted, it would have to be presumed that the cultural
nted in the Mahābhārata synchronise with those

represented in the Jātakas. But FICK&rsquo;s remarkable study relat ing to the Jatakas. clearly indicates that there is a wide gul ween the two. But perhaps the most convincing argument against the acceptance of the unified character of the Mahābhārata is the mention in the epic itself that it had been narrated on three different occasions and, therefore, has three different beginnings and three different forms.ga
The more common method of approach to the study of the Mahābhārata has, therefore, been shat is popularly known as the analytical method. Even a casual reader of the epic will be struck by certain conspicuous inconsistencies in it. He will, for instance, find&ndash;and this to his dismay&ndash;that the Pandayas, who have been glorified as the heroes of the epic, are never shown to conquer except through some kind of deceipt or fraud, Bhişma, the veteran warrior, could be overpowered only on account of Sikhandi&rsquo;s strategic intervention between him and &lsquo;Arjuna. Drona became the upfortunate victim of an anbiguous declaration pur posefully made by Dharmarāja, who is generally represented as the paragon of piety and righteousness. In his final encounter with Karna, the Pandava hero, Arjuna, is shown to have dis regarded all rules of dharma-yuddha. Indeed, several such instances can be quoted. And the wonder of it all is that these unchival rous acts were perpetrated by the Pandavas not only with the condivance of their friend, guide, and philosopher, Kțşoa, in whom, as a matter of fact, they recognised the incarnation of God, but on his active instigation. How can such obvious anomalies be explained away? This question formed the starting point of the penetrating investigations of Adolph HOLTZMANN.10 Following in the foot-steps of his paternal uncle, HOLTZMANN ultimately evolved a theory in connection with the growth of the Mahābhārala-a theory, which, on the face of it, aight seem more ingenious than convincing. He suggested that, in its original</li>

form, the epic must have been a poem in which the Kauravas were the heroes. Later on, however, as the result of changed circumstances, the epic was, as it were, set upon its head. It was, in other words, subjected to a process of tendentious inversion. The Kauravas, who were the righteous party in the original epic, now came to be represented as the villains and the Pandavas became the heroes,
HOLTZMANN does not stop only with enunciating a theory. He has also tried to offer some historical motivation for this wholesale inversion of the epic. He suggests, for instance, that the military feud between the Kauravas and the Pandavas is but a reflection of a conflict between the ancient ideal of chivalry sponsored by the Kauravas and the new polity and statecraft, which had been evolved in the meantime and which were adopted by the Pandavas. That feud is, according to him, also the reflec. tion of a religious conflict. The Kauravas, who seem to have been the yotaries of ancient Saivism, had to encounter the subsequent rise of Vaispavism, which the Pandavas seem to have accepted as their religious creed In the Mahābhārata, however, there is to be found no trace of such a collision between Saivism and Vaisnavism. HOLTZMANN is, therefore, required to adopt, in this connection, a more or less circuitous way. He points out that Saivism and Buddhism had many things in common, that Buddhism and Brahmanism were opposed to each other, and that Vaisnavism had assimilated several teachings of Brahmanism. So the con flict between saivism and Vaisnavism must have actually been represented as a conflict between Buddhism on the one hand and Brahmanism on the other.
As a matter of fact, this entire process of inversion is, according to HOLTZMANN, characteriscd by certain distinct stages Originally there must have existed an aocient poem composed by court-singers to extol the mighty deeds of the Kauravas. In course of time this ancient poem underwent two main transformations&ndash;both the transformations having been tendentious in character, Firstly, a talented. poet trans formed it into a poem in praise of an ancient Buddhist ruler,

counterpart in the downfall of the Kurus and its literary reflec. tion in the inversion of the original epic poem The followers of Krsna were shrewd enough not to give up altogether the original epic, which had already struck deep roots among the people They only recast it by giving it a strong Kęsnaite bias But this their recasting must be said to have been only skin deep, for, even after being tendentiously recast, the new epic clearly betrayed several essential features of its original form This is the reason why the present recension of the epic is characterised by many obvious inconsistencies and contradictions GRIERSON mentions a Brāhmana antı Brāhmana conflict as the principal motive for some kind of inversion of the original epic The Kauravas of Madhyadesa were, according to him, sponsors of Brahmanism They came into conflict with the Pancala Pandavas, who were unorthodox people, as is indicated, for instance, by the polyand rous marriage between the Pancāla princess, Draupadi, and the five Pāndavas The starting point of the actual struggle would then seem to have been the insult given to the Brāhmana, Drona, by the anti Brahmanic Pancāla king, Drupada Drona, seeking retribution, went over to the Kauravas, who claimed to be the defenders of Brahmanism, while Drupada was supported by the Pandavas, who were matrimonially allied to the Pāñcalas
The fact that different-and, what is more significant, mutually contradictory-motives have been suggested for the in version of the epic by HOLTZMANN and the other two scholars, definitely detracts from the soundness of their ingenious hypo thesis Moreover such a hypothesis has absolutely no external evidence to support It For instance, GRIERSON s assumptions regarding a war between the Kauravas of the Madhyadeśa and the Pañcala Pandavas and of a Brahmana-anti Brahmana conflict are historically unattestable Equally untenable i5 HOLTZ MANN&rsquo;s assertion that the present recension of the Mahabharata could not have been in existence before the 12th century AD. For, it can be proved, on the strength of the manuscript evi. dence, that no substantial or significant additions have becn made to the epic after the 11th century AD Even in the 8th century

AD, the Mahabharata must have been known io the from 10 which we now know it, namely as epic plus dharmasastra Indeed, there is inscriptional evidence to show that, in the 5th century AD, the Mahabharata was known as the work of Vyasa and as consistiog of 1,00,000 stanzas There is thus sufficient ground to suppose that, since at least a couple of centuries before 400 AD, the epic has remained practically unchanged Even so far as the internal evidence was concerned, one would search in vain for any traces of Buddhism in the epic HOLTZMANN, who speaks of a Buddhist transformation of the epic, himself admits this Similarly it would be difficult to find any portions of the epic where Brahmā is specifically glorified as the leading god As a matter of fact, a conflict of any consequence between the cult of Brahma and the cult of Krsna is almost unknown in the reli gous history of India All that can, therefore, be said of the inversion theory is that it is certainly attractive in its basic sugges tion but highly strained in its ramifications 120
12a In recent years I myself have tended to believe that, at a very carly stage, the original epic poem must have been tendentiously redacted in favour of the Pandavas Presumably, the Pandavas were not the direct legal scions of the huru family, though they mght have been in some way related to that family it is significant that the name Pandava does not occur In any carlier text But, being politically ambitious the Pandavas staked their claim to the throne of Hastinapura In order to support that claim they asserted their close relationship with the Kuru family through the myth of their hay. ing been the children of Kunti (and Madri) and the gods, Dharma, Vāyu, and Indra (and the two Afvins) They also cstablished politically useful alliance with the Pancalas through their marriage with Draupadl It further seems that, in their conflict with the hauravas, the Paodavas occasionally resorted to what might be called unchivalrous strategy Eventually the Pandavas came out victorious and, as a matter of course, the bardıc poem cmerged as a Pandava oriented saga It is not unlikely that the Pandavas bad actively sponsored one of the popular religious cults which was later assimi lated into hispaism When, therefore, the bardic poem, Jaya, was transfor med into the epic Bharata under the acgs of Krybaism, the Pandavas came to be represented as the special proteges of Krsna Similarly, in the appa rently unchivalrous episodes relating to the overpowenog of Bhisma, Droba harra, etc (see supra), the Pandavas are shown to have acted under the advice of hrsra Tor, a new political ethics bad arisen in the wake of popular Hinduism, and hopea, as a pragmatic leader, must have subscribed to it (see DANDEKAR, Insights into Hinduism p 255 )</li>

Ever since 1837, in which ycar LASSCN may be said to have inaugurated the modern period of critical scholarship relating to the Mahābhārata, it has been the theory of additions and nor. mal revisions which has held the field in onc form or another. Such a theory has, indecd, an initial advantage in that it is fully supported by the ancient Indian literary tradition. Moreover, as has been already pointed out, there is a clear mention in the epic itself that it was narrated on three different occasions and accordingly has three different beginnings and three different forms. It was, therefore, safe to start with the assumption that the Mahabharata, as we know it, was the result of a long process of growth. All that one was then expected to do nas to trace the various stages of that growth and to rationalise it, if possible, by offering some culture-historical motivation for it. LASSEN himself is of the opinion that the present recension of the cpic, which he calls the Saunala recension because Sauti gave a recita! of it at a sacrifice performed by Saunaka, is the second recension of the Mahabharata. It is, according to that scholar, this recen. sion, which is referred to in the Assalajana-Grhja-Sutra (III.4) where a Mahābhārata is mentioned by the side of a Bhārala. The ASGS, which is ascribed by LASSEN to about 350 B. C., thus knew of the two recensions of the epic—the Mahābhārata recen sion and the Bhārata recension. Jt can be presumed that by the Mahābhārata recension Afvalāyada actually meant the Saunaka recension, for, as LASSEN argues, ĀŠvalāyana is traditionally known to have been a pupil of Saunaka. The Saunaka recension must, accordingly, have come into being before about 350 B. C. LASSEN further adds that all Krsnaite interpolations are later than the Saunaka recension, that is later than the 4th century B.C. It will be easily seen that LASSEN&rsquo;s datiog of the AGS in the 4th century B, C. as also his identification of Saunaka, the teacher of Āśvalāyana, with Saunaka, who performed the sacrifice at which the Mahābhārata was recited, are quite hypothetical Further it is not clear why LASSEN should regard the Krsnaite elements in the epic as belonging to a period later

than the 4th century B. C. Pānini&rsquo;s reference to Vāsudeva and Arjuna clearly presupposes the existence of the Bhagavata cult, and Panini is certainly older than the 5th century B.C.
Through his apalysis of the Mahabhārata, WEBER has tried to discover Vedic sources for the epic material.14 But he cannot be said to have succeeded in discovering any direct organic connec tions between the Veda and the epic. LUDWIG follows,1s to a certain extent, the lead given by WEBER. But his main contri bution to the Mahabharata-problem must be said to be the emphasis which he has put on the two-fold motif of the epic&ndash;the historical and the mythical. The historical kernel of the epic is, according to him, the fact of the capture of the Kuruksetra on the banks of the Sarasvati by the Bharatas, who are already celebrated in the Veda in connection with the daśarajña battle. The character of the Paodavas is by no means strictly historical. As a matter of fact, LUDWIG suggests that each of the five Pândava brothers must have originally belonged to a different tribe and that the concept of the five Pāņdava brothers implies only a confederation of five tribes (again a reminder of the ten kings&rsquo; of the dāšarăjña). On these scanty and perhaps mutually unrelated historical foundations the epic-poet built up an entire superstructure embodying a seasonal myth. Some of the pointers to this seasonal myth are, according to LUDWIG, the blindness of Dhrtarāstra ( which stands for the powerlessness of the winter sun ), the polyandrous marriage between the Pandavas and Krsnā (which implies the contact of the rays of the pale sun [ Pandu ) with the dark earth ), and the self-imposed blindfolded ness of Gaodhāri ( which indicates that the consort of the winter sun was covered with clouds ) 150 Without examining all this at any length I shall only say that this method of telescoping natural

phenomena into mythology, which had once been very common, now fails to convince any critical student. Even the protagonists of this method would find themselves at loose ends, should they attempt to go the whole hog with it!
Perhaps the most detailed elaboration of this analytical method is seen in HOPKINS&rsquo;s famous book about the great epic.&rdquo; He speaks of the four stages of the growth of the Mahabhārata ex tending from 400 B.C. up to 400 A.D.&ndash;the stages, that is to say, of the Bharata lays, of the Mahabharata tale with the Pandavas as heroes, of the didactic interpolations, and of the later additions. The suggestions of HOPKINS, so far as they go-and they do go far enough , certainly have the great merit of clearing the ground for a proper approach to the Mahabhārata problem,
I may now briefly state my own view in the matter : I believe that, in a sense, the beginnings of the Alahābhārata, viewed as a whole, have to be traced back, both from the points of view of cultural history and literary history, to a period before the Vedic tās came into existence. A critical student will find that
Indian literature are characterised by two distinct literary traditions, which, for the sake of convenience, I have chosen to call the süta-tradition and the mantra-tradition. It will be easily realised that both these literary traditions were oral traditions; but there were certain essential differences bet. ween them. Broadly speaking, the sūta-tradition related to what may be described as secular matters and the doings of human heroes. The sūtas or bards, who were mainly responsible for this tradition, sang of the achievements of human heroes and kings, and of the normal life of the common people. In their ballads and popular folk songs, traditional legends and historical

Darratives, one finds represented several aspects of the secular life of the ancient Indians. The sūta-tradition thus comprised quite
a large amount of popular, bardic, legendary, and historical material. The mantra-tradition, on the other hand, related to what is generally understood by the terms, religious thought and practice. It consisted of the prayers, panegyrics, and magical incantations of the ancient Vedic Indians, their ritual fomulas and imprecations, and their spiritual yearnings and philosophical speculations.
It may be safely presumed that these two literary traditions - one secular-historical and the other mythological-ritualistic- both of which, must have, for obvious reasons, been originally fluid in character, had been growing side by side. In course of time, the very nature of the contents of the mantra-tradition demanded that the literature produced in that tradition should be properly organised and given a fixed literary form. For, in the matter of religious thought and practice, the poet-priests and the ritual priests of those days, as indeed of all times, brooked no elasticity. It is verily a universal phenomenon that some kind of rigidity and woodeoness soon begins to prevail in religious practice and correspondingly in religious literature. The literature produced in the mantra-tradition, accordingly, came to be collected and consolidated at a very early date, and, as the result of this, the Veda, as we know it, came into being. The sūta-tradition, on the other hand, continued to remain in a fluid and floating condi tion. This fact has given rise to the interesting paradox, namely, that, though many aspects of the contents of the sūta-tradition chronologically refer to a period perhaps earlier than the ope&rsquo; to which the contents of the mantra-tradition refer, the literary monuments, as such, of the sūta-tradition, which have come down to us, are distinctly later than those of the mantra-tradition.
The advantages of being reduced to a fixed literary form at an early stage of growth are self-evident. For one thing, it must have certainly facilitated the preservation of the mantra-tradition in a more or less perfect condition. On the other hand, a very large portion of the literature produced in the süla-tradition must278
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
have drifted along and eventually been lost. But there is also a serious disadvantage, from the culture-historical point of view, from which the mantra-tradition must have suffered. On accouat of the very fact that it was reduced to a fixed litorary form at aa early stage of its growth, the literature in the mantra-tradition was bound to become more or less static. It must have also soon lost its capacity to be responsive to the various vicissitudes in the life of the people at large. The sūta-tradition, on the other hand, remained dynamic and reacted and responded to the changing conditions The result of all this was that the sūta tradition assimilated into itself various elements belonging to both the Vedic Aryan and the non-Vedic proto-Indian cultures, while the tendencies represented in the mantra-tradition were, to a very large extent, priestly-hieratic. The literature in the mantra. tradition was essentially the literature of a limited section of the community while the sūta-tradition necessarily possessed a far wider popular appeal. One thing. However, must be emphasized in this connection. In spite of its general fluid and floating condition, the existence of the sūta-tradition was recognised by the mantra-tradition. For, in several texts belonging to the latter tradition, we come across frequent references to what was then known as itthâsa-purāna. As a matter of fact, such references have led some scholars to assume that, side by side with the literary monuments belonging to the mantra-tradition, there must have been in existence actual literary monuments belonging to the siita-tradition also. But there is not much evidence to support such an assumption. All that we can say in this respect is that the süla-tradition had certainly been in existence and recogoised at that time, but that that tradition had not then come to be con. solidated so as to manifest itself in the form of fixed literary monuments.
There is another point to which attention may be drawn in this connection. Apart from the frequent mention of itihasa. purāna in the literature belonging to the mantra-tradition, several clements of the süta-tradition had actually found their way in that literature. This was, indeed, inevitable. But, whic
TIIL MALIIDUĀRATA : ORIGIN AND GROWTH
279
adoptiog such clements in their literature, the sponsors of the mantra-tradition gave thosc clements an essentially priestly bias. The real purpose of thc sūkias rclatips to the battle of the ten lings, for instance, is not so much to celebrate the exploits of the Bharatas as to glorify the magical potency of the pricst-craft of Vasiştha. The clements of the süla-tradition have been pre served in the literature of the niantra.tradition in various forms. In the Samhitas we come across hymns, which are essentially human-historical in character, such as, for instance, those relating to the historical cvents like the dã Sarajna or those containing the praise of the libcrality of patrons (danassulis). Each of the Brahmana.texts can be pormally divided into tho parts, namely, the vidhi part and the artharada part. The vidhi part mainly deals with the theory and practice of somc Vedic sacrifice, whilc the arthavada part is gencrally devoted to the glorification of that Vedic sacrifice. By way of such glorification, the authors of the Brāhnanas very often quotc historical or mythical instances, which confirm the promised cslicaciousness of that particular sacri fice as a whole or of a specific item or detail of that sacrifice. Presumably many of these stories originally belonged to the literary tradition of the sūtas. Then there are a number of gärhās (or floating stanzas of popular wisdom) quoted in the Brälmaņa literature—and these too have to be traced back to the süta-tradition. Finally, there is a prescriptive provision made in some Vedic sacrifices for the recitals of ancient mythological and historical legends, which arc technically known as pāriplaas and nārašasis. But, as has been indicated above, all these elements of the sūta-tradition were exploited for purely priestly purposes and must be said to have accordingly lost their essential sautic character.
In the history of ancient Indian literature we can thus visua lise the growth of two principal literary traditions. One of them, namely, the mantra-tradition, soon came to be consolidated, so to say, on account of its avowedly priestly-religious purpose and con sequently began to manifest itself in fixed literary forms. The sūļa-tradition, on the other hand, continued to remain fuid, for a

pretty long time, presumably because its sponsors had not found any central motif or any adequate literary nucleus which would serve as a unifying factor for its many and varied elements In due course, however, such a motif for the unification and con solidation of the sautic material offered itself in the form of an important event in the history of ancient India As the result of the famous Vedic battle of ten kings, the clan of the Bharatas had attained a kind of sovereignty over the other states and prin cipalities - both Aryan and non-Aryan The scions of this great clan seem to have held sway over a major portion of Northern India, more or less unchallengedly, until some time round about the 13th and the 12th centuries B, C, when an apparently minor domestic quarrel among them happened to loom large on the poli tical horizon of the nation as a whole 164 The story of the con flict between the Kauravas and their cousins, the Pandavas, is too well known to need recounting That conflict arose out of the claim which the Pandavas advanced for a share in the blind king Dhrtarăstra&rsquo;s sovereign kingdom of Hastinapura By virtue of the preeminent position which the house of these scions of the Bharatas held in Indian politics of the time, what should have normally been an ordinary family feud soon assumed the proportions of a national crisis Kings and chieftains from all over the country arrayed themselves into two belligerent camps in accordance with their respective loyalties An epoch making war was fought on the famous battle-field of Kuruksetra This war continued just for eighteen days, but those eighteen days shook the whole country Entire armies on both sides - comprising mostly the flower of Indian youth-were laid low on the earth Eventually the Pandavas came out as victors in the war, which, very appro. priately, came to be called the Bharata war

nation of the bards of that time.168 Numerous ballads and songs must have been produced by the bards patronised both by the Kauravas and the Pandavas - the same episodes in the conflict being perhaps sometimes described with the Kaurava bias as well as the Pandava bias. After the dust raised by this national catastrophe bad settled down and a comparatively more peaceful era had been ushered in, all those ballads must have come to be welded together into a single unified literary work with a common central motif, namely, the victory of the Pandavas over the Kauravas 16c During this process of literary unification efforts must have paturally been made to revise many of the older ballads so as to bring them in line with the general trend of glorifying the victors, though, as can be easily realised, the results of such tendentious revision could not have been other than superficial. It may also be presumed that, in redacting these ballads, many ancient bardic and legendary elements were grafted, more or less organically, upon the historical elements relating to the Bhārata war. It is not unlikely that, in many cases, this operation substantially changed the original complexion of per sonalities and events, But with all this, one thing must be conce ded, namely, that the central motif was never lost sight of in this redaction and that, ultimately, a homogeneous literary with a more or less fixed literary form, was brought into being. This work claimed to constitute a historical poem with its central theme developed through the three stages of bheda (dissension ), rājyayınāśa (loss of the kingdom), and jaya ( victory):
16b It needs to be pointed out that the Bhārata war could certainly not have been an affair of such gigantic proportions as described in the Maha. Bharala, It is also doubtful whether the war had any nation-wide repercussions as such. Presumably, it assumed the importance which it did on account of the vital position of the Bharatas, the Kurus, the Pancalas, etc, in that period of the history of ancient Iodia. The factor of bardıc magnification and cxaggcration must also have come into play profusely. Incidentally, GONDA regards such double ethnic names as Kuru-Bharata, Kuru Pancāla, etc, as being indicative of the preference of the early Indian for bipartitions, complc. mentary oppositions, and other forms of duality conceived as unity (VIF 12,
120-27).

bhedo rajyarınašaś ca jajašca jay atam sara 17 This historical cpic poem, which dealt with the Bhārata war and which was very appropriately called Jaya ( - Victory), must, indeed be regarded as the first literary monument belonging to the suta tradition As a matter of fact, this poem facilitated, to a great extent, the crystallisation of further sautic material For, once a literary nucleus was created, it was easy to rally round it various other elements of the fluid sura tradition Accordingly, many ancient bardıc lays - more particularly those which cclebra ted the exploits of the Bhärata clan - must have been added to the Jaja in such a manner that they soon came to form an integ ral part of that historical poem While more and more material belonging to the suta tradition was thus becoming consolidated, the historical poem, Jaya, was being gradually transformed into the epic Bharala
But such transformation of the Jaja into the Bharata seems to have received perhaps a stronger impetus from another quarter In order to discover the source of that impetus, we shall have to turn to the religious history of ancient India While, on the one hand, the sūta tradition had just begun to become crystalli sed in a fixed literary form the literature belonging to the mantra tradition, which, as we have seen, had got an earlier start in the matter of crystallisation, had, on the other hand, already passed through at least three distiact periods of its history - the saminta period, the brahmana period, and the upanısad period On an earlier occasion, I have tried to show how the conditions created during the upanı sad period resulted in bringing about 2 virtual break in the continuity of the Vedic (or Brahmanic) way of life and thought 18 The interregoum following the upanışan period, indeed, proved to be exceedingly eventful from the point

of view of the religious history of India. The natural reaction to the conditions created by the upanişads manifested itself mainly in four forms - firstly, the rise of the heterodox systems of thought; secondly, the comprehensive movement, intiated in the sütra-yedārga-period, for the resuscitation and consolidation of the Vedic way of life and thought this movement having been started as a counterblast against the heterodox movements); thirdly, the development of new ideals in polity and statecraft (as seen in the arthasistra); and fourthly, the steady growth of a popular religion - a religion, which had its roots in the thought and practices of the indigenous population of India but which had not altogether forsworn the Vedic Aryan influences. It is the last two aspects - and, more particularly, the fourth aspect - of the reaction, which seems to have operated most fundamentally in the matter of the consolidation of the epic Bhārata. The comprehensive movement started for the revival of Brahmanism, which found its literary expression in the stītras and the vedārgas, did, no doubt, serve as an efficient counterblast against the heterodox religious movements. But, as it happened, the sūtra vedāriga-movement could not free itself from the spell of the fastidious ritualism and exclusive social order sponsored by the earlier Brahmanism. It could not, therefore, command a truly popular appeal. Indeed, what started as a popular Vedic movement to counteract the influence of heterodox religions, reverted, in a sense, to the exclusiveness which was characteristic of the brahmana-period. As against this, another popular reli gious movement, which, as a matter of fact, started with a kind of opposition to certain features of Brahmanic religion but which, in the long run, claimed to owe allegiance – howsoever nominal and superficial – to the Veda, proved remarkably effective in arresting the onslaught of the pop-Vedic religions. This popular religious movement seems to have started mainly among the Vrşnis and the Sātvatas and to have soon spread among other tribes such as those of the Abbiras, the Yādavas, and the Gopālas. All these tribes belonged to and ruled over various parts of the middle and western India. The principal teacher and leader of
284
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
this new religious movement was Krsna, who, in course of time, came to be associated, in one way or another, with the various tribes mentioned above. As is but natural in such cases, he soon became their tribal hero, and, later, their tribal god.188
There were four main planks in Kççna&rsquo;s religious platform. The first of these pertains to the goal of spiritual life. The goal of spiritual life as enunciated in the upanışads is ātmajñana (= realisation of the self). The spiritual emancipation of an individual consists, according to the upanısads, in his realisation that the individual soul (ja) is, in the ultimate analysis, identi. cal with the universal soul (brahman). As the result of nescience, the universal soul, which is the only reality, becomes conditioned by the limitations of the physical body, the sense-organs, and the intellect, and thereby the illusion of the individual soul is cres ted. Through true knowledge, the individual shakes off his 10 dividuality, which is after all unreal and temporary, and becomes conscious of his real nature. The upanışads also emphasise that the phenomenal world is essentially unreal and that, therefore, so long as an individual remains involved in its various operations, he has no chance of attaining his spiritual goal. By thus deny ing the reality of the world and by making the individual the centre of their speculations, the Upanisadic teachings have, in a sense, divested themselves of all social value. The individual is, indeed, encouraged to run away from his social responsibilities and bury himself within himself. As against this individualistic, abstract, and more or less negative concept of spiritual life, Krsna taught that the true spiritual life consisted in loka-sangraha - that is to say, in the promotion of the stability and solidarity of society. Society, as a whole, can function properly only on the princi ple of ethical interdependence of its various constituents. Every individual must, indeed, regard himself as an essential constituent of society and must make his contribution towards its building up, preservation, and progress. Krsna thus gave a distinctly
18a. For details, sce“ Hinduism : retrospect and prospect&rdquo; and “ Vaiba vism and Saivista &quot; in DANDEKAR, Insights into Hinduism,
THE MAHĀBHĀRATA : ORIGIN AND GROWTH
285
social orientation to the thought relating to spiritualism. The upanisadic ideal of atmajñāna necessarily presupposes a complete renunciation from this-worldly life. In the new popular religion of Krşna, with its goal of Toka-sangraha, an empty life of renunciation had no place whatsoever. In the place of sannyāsa, therefore, Krşna taught the doctrine of harmayoga. Every person has got to perform his social duties as best as he can. But this does not necessarily imply that he should indulge in all kinds of activities and thus neglect his personals piritual emancipation. In karmayoga, Krşna has struck the most remarkable compromise between the metaphysical ideal of individual emancipation and the ethical ideal of social responsibility. It is not action, as such, which constitutes a bar to individual emancipation; it is the attitude in which apy particular action is done, which determines whether or not that action would constitute such a bar. It is, indeed, possible, according to Krsna, to combine the ethical advantages of activism with the spiritual advantages of reduncia tion by adopting a way of life, in which one fulfils his social obligations through proper actions which he performs in an attitude of renunciation so far as his own personal interest in those actions is concerned. The goal of one&rsquo;s life should not be Werely to attain one&rsquo;s own emancipation; it should rather be to continue to work even after attaining personal emancipation, with a view to securing the emancipation of his fellow-men. In his religious teaching, Krsna may be said to have thus reinter preted the upanisadic ideals of sannjäsa and moksa in terms of social ethics.
The third aspect of Kssna&rsquo;s teaching pertains to religious practice. The Brahmanic ritualism, as we have seen on another occasion,19 could not, for obvious reasons, become a truly popular religious practice. It also implied some kind of social and intellectual exploitation. With a view, therefore, to counter acting the inevitable exclusiveness engendered in religious matters by the cult of sacrifice, Kęşa replaced that cult with the cult of
19. Sce the paper mentioned in foot-note 18.

EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
bhaktı And as is very well known, in the religious history of India, nothing indeed has proved so successful in bringing about a truly democratic spiritual brotherhood among men as the cult of bhaktı It may, however, be incidentally pointed out that, so far as ritualism is concerned, Krsna has not altogether given up the concept of sacrifice Like the concepts of moksa and samnyasa, he has rather reinterpreted it in the light of social ethics
And finally, the popular movement of Krsna is characterised by its emphasis on religious and philosophical synthesis The Brahmanic teachers as we know from the brahmanas and the upanisads had been rather opinionated in their speculations relating both to ritualism and spiritualism As a shrewd leader of men Krsna realised that religious and philosophical dogmatism often tended to divide the people while synthesis united them Without, therefore, sponsoring any particular system of thought exclusively he tried to discover the possible similarities among the various systems and to represent them as but different points of view and different ways of approach - all in the ultimate analysis, having the realisation of the one and the same supreme reality as their common goal
This new teaching characterised by its bold emphasis on loka samgraha instead of atmañana, karmayoga instead of samnjasa bhaktı instead of ritualism, and philosophical synthesis sostead of dogmatism naturally appealed to all strata of society It served a two fold purpose On the one hand through its drastic departure from the Brahmanic teachings it made up for the inevitable weakness of the Brahmanic way of life and thought, and, on the other, while doing so, it took care to create the impression that the Brahmanic way of life and thought was not being altogether abjured
The rise of Krsnaism on the religious horizon of ancient India synchronised with the partially accomplished process of the enlargement of the historical poem, Jaja, into the epic, Bharald This newly emerging literary monument of the suta tradition

had instantly caught the imaginotion of the people. What wonder then that the practically-minded sponsors of Krsnaism should have thought of employing this popular epic as a vehicle for propagating their religious teaching? They, accordingly, redacted the partially completed epic, Bharata, in such a way as to make it serve their own purpose. They started by associating the heroes of the epic, namely, the Pandavas, with Kțsoa. Krsna came to be represented as a relative of the Pandavas, indeed, as their friend, guide, and philosopher. The Pandavas, in their turn, came to be represented as being fully conscious of the god-head of Krsna. It came to be suggested that Krsna was really res ponsible for all that the epic heroes were enabled to achieve. In short, Krsna soon became the central figure of the epic - the pivot round which all persons and events in the epic revolved. And as Krsna&rsquo;s personality grew in divinity, the cpic correspond ingly grew in its extent. New legends were produced or old legends modified with the sole purpose of confirming and glorify ing the divinity of Krsna. And these legends were introduced in suitable contexts in the older epic, and where such contexts did not exist they were artfully created. All credit is, indeed, due to the remarkable ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Krsnaite redac tors, who brought about these basic changes in the older epic in such a manner as not to give any cause for even a faint suspicion that the character of Kțsaa was really extraneous to the original epic. But the real cornerstone of this Kęsnaite superstructure must be said to be the Bhagavadgita. The Bhaga vadgitā epitomises, in the most perfect manner, the religious, ethical, and metaphysical teachings of Krsna, which have been briefly outlined above.19a This work, indeed, gave quite a new complexion to the whole epic. The Krsnaite redactors, who seem to have been creat literary artists, conceived a very dramatic back ground for this Lord&rsquo;s Song so as to render it more appealing to the people. In a sense, it made tbe people realise that philo sophising was not something to be practised in isolation by a select

few; philosophy rather dealt with the problems which confronted a common man in his normal life. One may, therefore, say that, just as the Bharata represented the literature of the people, the Bhagavadgitā represented the philosophy of the people.19)
Broadly speaking, the epic Bhārata is thus the result of the operation of the processes of bardıc enlargement and Krsnaite redaction on the bistorical poem, Jaya. The heroes of this historical poem were Ksatriyas; the large amount of bardic and legendary material which came to be added to that poem was also mostly related to the Ksatriya warriors; even the religious teach ings which came to be propagated through the epic were derived from the non-Brahmanic sources. In short, the epic, in this form, showed a distinct Ksatriya - non-Brahmanic - imprint. In the reli gious history of India, two movements, originating in two distinct ideologies, seem to have been jointly responsible for stemming the growth of the heterodox systems of thought, which had streng thened their position during the interregnum following the upani şadic period. They were the sūtra-vedānga-Brahmanism and Hinduism-Krsnaism. By its very nature, however, it was the latter which held the field after the decline of the heterodox religions But once the danger of the avowedly anti-Brahmanic religions was past, the sponsors of Brahmanism again began gradually to assert themselves They knew that, though Krsnaism represented, in some respects, a definite reaction against Brahmanism, it was not avowedly anti-Brahmanic. It was, therefore. possible to bring

regarded as an authentic Krsnajte document. They introduced into the epic-sometimes in place, but, more often, out of place-a large amount of material relating to Brahmanic learning and culture. Whole tracts dealing with Brahmanic religion and philo sophy, law and ethics, cosmology and mysticism, and social and political theories found their way into the epic. New legends with a distinct Brahmanic bias now came to be inserted into the epic. In most of these legends, the heroes of the epic came to be represented as the defenders of Brahmanic faith and culture. In this context, it may be incidentally pointed out that, in comparison with the methods of the Krsņaite redactors, those of the Brahmanic redactors were obviously gross. As a matter of fact, the activity of the sponsors of Brahmanism ought to be described not as artistic redaction but as flagrant interpolation.
In this process of brahmanisation a significant change was effected also in the character of Krşna himself. The personality of Kșşma had by that time already become essentially syncretic, for, there were assimilated into it elements derived from various socurces - elements, for instance, relating to Vasudeva-Kssaa, the tribal hero of the Vrsnis; Gopāla-Kțsna, the tribal god of the cowherds; Bhagavān-Kļşna, the teacher of Krşgaism as embodied in the Bhagavadgitā; and Yādava-Krşoa, the mentor of the Pandavas. As the result of the Brahmanic revision, Kysna now came to be regarded as an avatāra of the All-God, Vişnu, and, ultimately, even as being ideoticat with the uponisadic Brahman.196 The elements relating to Brahmapic dharma and niti were superimposed upon the bardic-historical elements derived from the sūta-tradition and the religio-ethical elements derived from Krsnaison - and eventually the Bhārata became transformed into the Mfahābhārata.
It is possible to derive, from thc Mahābhārata itself, certain clues which would help us in formulatiog a hypothesis regarding the identity of the train Brahmanic redactors of the epic. A critical cxamipation of the legends and doctrines, which have been in

serted into the epic during the brahmanising process, would reveal that a majority of them showed an unmistakable bias in favour of the family of the Bhārgavas.20 The Bhārgavas have, no doubt, played a very significant role in the cultural history of ancient India. But when we take into consideration the fact that they did not have the remotest connection with the kernel of the epic, the other fact, namely, that the largest number and the greatest variety of legends in the Mahābhārata relate to them, assumes a special significance in connection with the growth of the epic. The tendency to bhrguise the epic, so to say, becomes manifest in several ways. Just consider the very beginning of the Nahā. bhārata. It is well known that the famous Bhārata war was fought at Kuruksetra. But the sūta, Ugraśravas, who recited the epic at the sacrificial session of Saunaka, refers to the scene of the war not as Kuruksetra but as Samantapancaka. This then gave the epic redactors an opportunity to glorify an outstanding event in the career of one of the most intriguing personalities among the Bhārgavas, namely, Paraśurāma For, on being asked by the sages, assembled at Saunaka&rsquo;s sacrificial session, why the place was called Samantapaficaka, the sūta narrates the story of how, between the tretā and the dräpara ages, Parasurama extir. pated the entire race of the Ksatriyas, collected their blood into five pools, and offered that uncanny oblation to his pitars. Indeed, this exploit of the total annihilation of the Ksatriyas, which is said to have been repeated by Parasurama twenty-one times, has itself been referred to over and over again in the epic. Bhargavarama is further glorified by being represented as the preceptor of several Mahabharata warriors &ndash; Drona and Karna being the most outstanding among them. And lest one might feel inclined to doubt how Bhārgavarāma, who had lived between the tretā and the dräpara, could at all have been the guru of the epic warriors, who are believed to have lived between the dvāpara and the kalı ages, the epic redactors have forestalled such a doubter

by already proclaiming that it was quite possible since Rāma Bhargava was ciramjiva ( = long-lived). The inclusion of Paraśurāna in the list of the sixteen kings in the sodaśa-räjakiya section of the Dronaparvan,22 which recounts the heroic deeds of sixteen illustrious kings of antiquity, when, actually, Parasurama was no king at all; the reference, in the Bhagavadgitā, to the three Bhārgavas, namely, śukra (kavinām ušanā kavih),23 Paraśurāma (rāmah sastrablirtām ahan),24 and Bhrgu ( maharşınām bhgur tham )25 as the vibhūtis of the All-God; the mention of Bhigu as having been born directly out of the heart of Brabmā (brahmano hrdayan bhittvã nińsrto blagavān blirguh)28-and this in close proximity to the celestials, - these are some of the other instances of a tendentious revision of the epic by bold Brahmanic redactors with strong Bhargava leanings. The Bhārgavas are often repre sented in the epic as great teachers of dharma and niti. This is, indeed, a claim to which they seem to be entitled, for, is the expert knowledge of the Bhargavas in the field of dharma and niti, also not otherwise confirmed,- for instance, by such facts as that the Manusmrtı is traditionally knows also as the Bhrgusam htā? Even the normal life of the people has not escaped the influence of the Bhārgavas. There occurs in the Mahabhārata an interesting legend explaining how two things, which later became quite familiar in every-day life, namely, sandals and umbrella, came to be introduced the person responsible for this introduc tion, of course, being a Bhārgava.27 All these and similar other facts would thus lead one to the irresistible conclusion that it must have been the Bhargavas who were primarily responsible for the brahmanisation of the epic. As a matter of fact the brahmani sation of the epic not infrequently amounted also to its bhrguisation.

It is generally believed that the Veda has made the most significant contribution to the moulding of the Indian way of life and thought, through the ages As a matter of fact, ancient Indian culture, or, more precisely, the Hindu culture, as a whole, is not infrequently characterised as the Vedic culture A critical analysis of the Hindu way of life and thought would, however, expose the inadequacy of such characterisation The principal gods of the Vedic pantheon, like Indra and Varuna, are now rarely worshipped The elaborate system of sacrifice, which had been evolved and consolidated during the Brahmana period and resuscitated and reorganised during the Sutra period and which had come to be recognised almost as the hall mark of the Vedic religion, has pow been almost entirely relegated to the back ground The philosophical speculations of the Upanisads have either undergone vital modifications or have been superseded by other systems of thought In short, the values sponsored by the Veda have long since ceased to operate as the essential motive force of the Indian Weltanschauung It is not the Brahmanism of the Veda, but popular Hinduism, which traditionally claims to have derived its inspiration from the Veda but which, historically speaking, has assimilated within itself perhaps more non Vedic elements than the Vedic opes, that dominates the socio religious life of India And the literary works which have left an abiding imprint on the socio religious life sponsored by Hinduism are not so much the Vedas as the popular epics Even among these popular epics, if there is any one single work which has proved to be a factor of inestimable import in the making of the life and thought of the Indian people and which still continues to

be a living force in Indian life, it is the Mahabharata, the great national epic of India.
The Mahābhārata is, indeed, a unique phenomenon in the literary history not only of India but of the whole world. For one thing this epic, which is traditionally believed to consist of 100,000 stanzas, is the biggest single literary work kaown to man. It is eight times as big as Homer&rsquo;s Ilhad and Odyssey put together. But it is not only its size which entitles the Mahābhārata to the claim of uniqueness. Its contents too are unique in many respects. Even a casual reader of the Mahābhārata would be struck by its truly encyclopaedic character. The Mahābhārata constitutes a dynamic record of an extensive period of India&rsquo;s history - a record which is prepared by poets who possessed a marvellous insight into the lives of men and women belonging to all strata of society. It is well and truly said that in the Mahā bhārata breathe the united soul of Jodia and the individual souls of ber people. But the appeal of the Mahābhārata is not merely Indian or national; it is essentially human or universal. As the author of the epic justifiably claims :
dharnie că &lsquo;rthe ca häme ca rrokse ca bliaratarsablia /
yad ihā &lsquo;sti tad anyatra yan ne &lsquo;hā &lsquo;sti na tat kvacit // In matters relating to religion and ethics, to material progress and prosperity, to the enjoyment of the pleasures of personal and social life, and to spiritual emancipation, whatever is embodied 10 this epic may be found elsewhere; but what is not found here it will be impossible to find anywhere else. Indeed, it will not be an exaggeration to say that there is hardly any human thought or sentiment which has not found expression in the Mahabharata; and there is hardly any situation conceivable in human life which has not been portrayed in it.
How did this unique work - vast in extent, encyclopaedic in content, and universal in appeal - come into being ? Prima facie, the Malābhārata does not appear to have been the creation of one

author or even of one generation of authors. It must have been the outcome of a long and continuous literary activity spread over many centuries, Scholars like DAHLMANN, however, believe that the Mahābhārata is a unified work, that in it two elements - the epic and the didactic - have been artistically welded together, and that this welding together has been accomplished by a single inspired poet. More or less similar views have been put forth by SORENSEN, BARTH, and Sylvain LÉVI. OLDEN BERG, on the other hand, has characterised - justifiably but rather in strong terms - all such attempts at discovering in the
ibhārata a unified work as constituting &lsquo;scientific monstro sity.&rsquo; He, therefore, advocated the analytical method as the only sound method for the study of the epic. An analytical approach inevitably leads one to the assumption that, through the centuries, the epic has been subjected to several revisions and redactions involving numerous variations, additions, and omissions. This process of constant revision and redaction of the epic has, however, been represented differently by different scholars Adolf HOLTZMANN, for instance, suggested that in its original form the epic was a poem in which the Kauravas were the heroes. Later on, however, on account of changed historical circumstances, the epic was, as it were, set upon its head. It was subjected to a process of tendentious inversion, with the result that the Kauravas, who were the righteous party in the original epic, now came to be represented as the villains, while the Pāndavas, with all their unchivalrous ways, were made the heroes. It is obviously not possible here to examine HOLTZMANN&rsquo;S views at any great length. Suffice it to say that this and similar other theories have to be regarded as being more ingenious than convinciog.
Let me briefly state my own view regarding the origin and the growth of the Mahābhārata. A critical student of ancient Indian literature knows ibat in the earliest period of the literary history of India there developed, side by side, two distinct literary traditions, which for the sake of convenience I have chosen to call the süta-tradition and the mantra-tradition.
THE MAHABHARATA AND ITS CRITICAL EDITION
295
Broadly speaking, the mantra-tradition related to religious thought and practice while the stīta-tradition related to secular matters and the doings of human heroes. The mantra-tradition consisted of mythological legends, prayers, and panegyrics, magical incanta tions, ritual formulas, and mystic speculations of the ancient Vedic Indiaos, while the sūta-tradition comprised a large amount of popular, bardic, legendary, and historical material. It may be safely presumed that, in the initial stages, both these traditions were fluid in character. In course of time, however, the very nature of the mantra-tradition made it imperative that its contents be properly organised and given a fixed literary form. The early literary monuments belonging to the mantra-tradition have been preserved for us in the form of the Vedic literature. The sūta tradition, on the other hand, continued to remain in fluid and floating condition. No doubt some of its elements had inevitably crept into the mantra-tradition and had been reduced to a fixed
literary form. Accordingly, in the Vedic literature also we come across such sautic material as the dána-stutis and the gathās, and the pāriplalas and the nārāśamsis. But, by and large, the sita tradition continued to remain fluid for a pretty long time, presumably because there had not been in existence any central motif or any adequate literary pucleus which could have served as a unifying factor for its many and varied elements,
Such a literary nucleus, however, soon offered itself in the form of a bardic-historical poem relating to the Bhārata war. The antecedents of this war are too well known to need recount ing. As the result of the famous Vedic battle of the ten kings the clan of the Bharatas had attained a kind of sovereignty over the other contemporary states and principalities, both Aryan and non-Aryan.3 The scions of this great clan continued to dominate politically a major part of Northern India almost unchallenged until some time between the 14th and the 12th centuries B. C. About that time, there arose among the Kauravas and the Pandavas, both of whom claimed to be the legal heirs to the

the Bhagavadgilā. The Bhagaradgitā epitomises the religious, ethical, and philosophical teachings of Krşņa, and the Krşpite redactors of the epic must be said to have conceived a very dramatic back-ground and form for it.
Broadly speaking, the epic Bhārata is thus the result of the operation of two processes on the bardic-historical poem Jaya, namely, of the process of bardic enlargement and that of Krşaite redaction. It may be noted that the large amount of bardic and egendary material which came to be added to that poem as also the religious teachings and ethical code which came to be propagated through the epic were mostly derived from the non Brahmapic sources. In the religious history of India, two move ments, originatiog in two distinct ideologies, seem to have been jointly responsible for stemming the advance of the heterodox systems of thought, which had strengtheped their position during the interregnum following the Upanisadic period. They were the sūtra-yedariga Brahmanism and the popular Hinduism. By its very nature, however, it was the latter which held the field after the decline of the heterodox religions. But once the danger of the avowedly anti-Brahmanic religions was past, the sponsors of Brahmanism again began gradually to assert themselves. They knew that, though the popular Hinduism represented, in some respects, a definite reaction against Brahmanism, it was not avowedly anti-Brahmanic. It was, therefore, possible to bring about a workable compromise between Brahmanism and the popular Hinduism - that is to say, so far as the present context is concerned, between Brahmanism and Kțsnaism. The sponsors of Brahmanism accordingly attempted to brahmanise, so to say, the popular religion of Krsoa as far as it was feasible to do so. Indeed, they attempted thus to brahmanise several minor popular religious sects. So far as Kęsnaism was concerned, the sponsors of Brahmanism seem to have started their brahmanising operation with the epic Blärata which had, by then, almost come to be regarded as an authentic Kțsnite document. They introduced in

The elements relating to Brabmanic dharnia and nitt were thus superimposed upon the bardic-historical elements derived from the suta tradition and the religio ethical elements derived from Krsnaism - and eventually the Bharata was transformed into the Mahabharata
The transmission of the Mahabharata (or the Šatasālasri Samhita) is characterised by a truly bewildering mass of versions and sub versions Indeed no other work illustrates the dictum &ldquo;as many manuscripts so many texts, more aptly than the great epic This phenomenon of luxuriant growth and indiscriminate fusion of versions can be explained only on the assumption that after its composition the Mahabharata had, in the course of all these centuries been handed down in different forms and sizes from bard to bard througli oral tradition and that therefore, no special care had been taken to guard its text against partial corruption and elaboration or against arbitrary emendation and normalization This state of things must have continued even after the text of the epic had been reduced to writing The epic itself seems to bear testimony to this process, for, while referring to the five direct pupils of Vyasa namely, Sumuntu Jaimini, Paila, Suka, and Vaisam pāyana, it says
samlitas laih prihakivena bharalasy a prahasılah 8 8 AIBA 1 57 75
THE MAHĀBHARATA AND ITS CRITICAL EDITION

Accordingly, even in its early phases, the Mahābhārata text tradition had been not singular and uniform but multiple and polygenous. And this is, indeed, what is to be expected of &amp; work which has proved to be a vital force in the life of a volatile people. The numerous variants, additions, and omissions which distinguish the various versions of the Mahabharata are indicative of the dynamic character of the epic. They cmphasise the fact that thMahābhārata had been organically related to the life of the people as a book of constant inspiration and guidance.
But it was also natural that, with the advance of scientific Indology which had become evident in India and outside in the course of the past hundred years, the need should have been felt for a critical edition of the Mahābhārata. The credit for first voicing this need, in more or less clear terms, goes to WINTER NITZ who, in his paper presented before the 11th International Congress of Orientalists held at Paris in 1897, laid special stress on this desideratum of a critical edition of the Mahābhārala &ldquo;as the only sound basis for all Mahābliärata studies, nay, for all studies connected with the epic literature of India.&rdquo; There were, no doubt, available in India scveral printed cditions of the epic. The Molībhārata was first published at Calcutta, in four volumes, during the years 1834-39. This was followed in 1862 by the well-loown police edition lithographed in Bombay by Ganpat Krishnaji, who issued the same in printed form in the following year. In South India, there had been current a text of the epic which differed substantially from the texts of the Calcutta and the Bombay editions. All these cditions were, however, sadly deficient from the critical scliolar&rsquo;s point of view, for, they either merely reproduced the version of a particular type of manuscripts or else were eclectic on no recognizable principles and, therefore, failed to remove the uncertainty of the text. WINTERNITZ who was convinced that a critical edition of the Nialūbhūrala was a sine qua non for all historical and critical research regarding the great epic of India,&rdquo; persisted in his efforts, as the result of which the International Union of Academies resolved in 1904 to under take the preparation of such an edition. Funds were raised for
302
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
the purpose, and a specimen of the edition prepared by LÜDERS was actually published for private circulation among scholars. But then came the first world war which interrupted all scholarly work in the West However, soon after the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute was founded in 1917, its workers, in their youthful enthusiasm, decided to venture upon the critical edition, making a fresh start. Accordingly, in April 1919, Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar formally inaugurated the work by writing on the collation sheet the mangala-sloka of the epic :
nārāyanam namaskrtya naram cai &lsquo;va narottamam/
devin sarasvatiṁ cai &lsquo;va tato jayam udirayet // Ever since the time when the question of the critical edition of the Mahābhārata was first mooted, it had been clearly realised that, on account of the peculiar manner in which the epic had been transmitted through the centuries, it was not possible to apply to it the special canons of textual criticism which were derived from a study of classical ( Greek and Latin ) texts and which depended ultimately upon there being a more or less complete concatenation of copies and examplars reaching finally back to a single authentic written archetype. It was, therefore, necessary to tackle the problem of the Mahābhārata textual criticism in a different manner. The method of the Mahabharata textual criticism bad to be evolved only from a special study of the Mahābhārata manuscripts and of the peculiar conditions of the transmission of the text of the epic And such a study made it clear, almost at the very beginning, that an eclectic but cautious utilization of all manuscript classes was the only method which could be fruitfully employed in respect of the Mahābhārata. Since all categories of manuscripts had their strong points and their weak points, each variant had to be judged on its own merits A text constituted on eclectic principles, with due circum spection, was bound to present a more faithful picture of the elusive &quot; original” than any single extant codex could do.

I shall now attempt to state-of course, in broad outline - the methodology of the Mahābhārata textual criticism adopted by the Institute. The first step was obviously the search for and collection of as many manuscripts of the epic - that is to say, manuscripts comprising the entire epic ( which however are rare) or a group of parvans or a single parvan (which last are the most numerous) - as possible.
The collection of manuscripts was followed by the collation of manuscripts. For this purpose, the text of the epic popularised by the commentator Nilakantha was taken as the vulgate. The various manuscripts were compared with the vulgate, letter by letter, and the differences in readings, etc., were carefully recorded. This collation-work was a stupendous task involving many lacs of collation-units.10 Of course, not all the collected manuscripts were thus collated. The dictum which served as the main guidiog principle in the matter of the selection of manuscripts was that, in textual criticism, it was not the number of manus-, cripts of a given text but the number of independent versions of that text that really mattered. In this connection it was observed that manuscripts written in a particular script, which were more or less exclusively derived from the region in which that script was used, usually represented a distinct version. This is the reason Why the various versions of the Mahābhārata are, except in one case, denoted in the critical edition by the names of the relevant scripts. 11 It must, however, be pointed out that the case of the Devanāgari script was peculiar in that it was a sort of a .vulgar script, widely used and understood in India. Similarly, as has been already indicated, the process of free comparison of manus

cripts and extensive mutual borrowings had always been in evidence, and the Devanagari was the chief medium of contami nation between the different recensions and versions Another criterion for the selection of manuscripts for collation was their age Old manuscripts, even though fragmentary and partly illegible, were preferred to modern looking manuscripts, though complete and well preserved Within a version discrepant types were chosen in preference to similar types
A critical study of the voluminous collations pertaining to any parvan of the Mahabharata at once brings out the fact that the epic has been handed down in two major recensions or text traditions, namely, a Northern (N) recension and 1 Southern (S) recension Further, it also shows that cach of these recensions is characterised by a plurality of versions, cach of which latter again contains a multiplicity of sub groups The Northern recension is represented by the manuscripts written in the scripts of Āryāvarta, such as Sarada, Nepall (Newari) Maithill, Bengali, and Devinigarl, while the Southern recension is represented by the manuscripts written in the scripts of Daksina. patha, such as Telugu, Grantha, and Malayalam Apart from these scriptal differences, the two recensions differ in the matter of the division of the Mahabharata into its various parvaps ror instance, against the commonly adopied conventional division of the cpic into eighteen parvans, there is a Southern tradition of
vision of the epic into twenty four parvans Besides this the manuscripts of the two recensions show numerous other discrepancies, big and small discrepancies in the spelling of the most ordinary words, c &amp; N irida S srila or rrila, especially of proper names N Naimşa, S aimiša, in the readings of words, phrases, lines, and stanzas, in the scquence of all these clements, 111 the relative position of single adhy lyas, and in the relative sequence of wholc crisodes &ldquo;Then there are numerous additions and omissions It may be pointed out that the Southern

recension is longer than the Northern recepsion, because of the additional passages which have been distributed all over that recension of the epic. The story in the Southern recension is richer in details and elaborate in treatment. Altogether that recension gives the impression of a deliberate attempt at precision, schematization, and a thoroughly practical outlook. The Northern recension, on the other hand, is vague, unsystematic, and inconse quent. The Southern recension, which may be said to present the textus ornatior, is marked by a distinct ethical bias and is full of septentious maxims, while the Northern recension contains a naively narrated story. In spite of these differences between the two recensions of the Mahābhārata - differences which must not by any means be underrated - the two recensions also reveal a distinct and undeniable family resemblance. In other words, a study of the manuscripts belonging to the two recensions unmistakably leads us to the conclusion that they must have been independent copies of a single orally transmitted text.
The stemma codicum or the genealogy of the Mahābhārata manuscripts may then be represented somewhat as follows: The Ur-Mahābhārata, the origin and growth of which I have already attempted to trace, had, at some stage in the course of its oral transmission through different rhapsodists who recited the epic differently, consolidated itself into two distinct text-traditions or recensions, namely, the Northern recension and the Southern recension. The Northern recension is then seen to have branched off into two major sub-recensions - the North-western sub recension and the Central sub-recension. The North-westera sub-recension further gave rise to two versions, namely, the Säradā and the Kashmiri versions, while the Central sub-recension grew into two groups, the Eastern group, comprising the Nepāli, the Maithili, and the Bengāli versions, and the Central group which is represented by the Devanagari version. The Southern Tecension seems to have branched off into two sub-recepsions - the Eastern sub-recension comprising the Telugu and the Grantha Versions, and the Western sub-recension comprising the Malaya lam version.

Now something about the main characteristics of the different versions : The Sāradā version which is, in a sense, an isolated version, being least contaminated with other versions, preserves the text of the epic in a more or less pristine form. It has, accordingly, proved to be of the greatest value for the critical edition. The Kāshmiri version is quite peculiar, for, though the manuscripts of this version are written in the Deva pāgari script, they show an unmistakable textual affinity with the Śäradā version. These manuscripts have, indeed, to be regarded as Devanāgari transcripts of the saradā versioD. Here, then, is a case where the script of the manuscripts does not determine their text-critical value. The Nepali, the Maithill, and the Bengali versions often go together, showing minimal mutual variations. Though the unitary character of the Bengali version becomes easily manifest, that version tooks, in many cases, like &amp; sub version or an Eastern extension of the central Devanāgari version. The composite character of the Devanagari version becomes evident from the features of both the Northern and the Southern recensions partaken by it. The Telugu version stands on the border-land of the Northern and the Southern recensions, but its essential character as a version affiliated to the major Southern textual tradition is unmistakable. Among the Southern versions, the Telugu and the Grantha versions are closer to each other, while the Malayalam version often stands by itself. Indeed, in a sense, the Malayalam version may be regarded as being in relation to the Southern recension what the Sarada version is in relation to the Northern recension.
Apart from the large number of manuscripts belonging to the various versions mentioned above. certain testimonia or aids of a particular or subsidiary character have been used by way of critical apparatus for the critical cdition of the Mahabharata. Thcsc testimonia normally consist of (1) the adaptations of the cpic like the Javanesc adaptation Bläratam ( about A. D. 1000) And the Telugu adaptation by Nannaya (about A. D. 1025 ) called Andhra Bhūralamu, (2) the epitomcs in Sanskrit like the Bhāratamarjari of Ksemondra (about A. D. 1050 }, the Bald.

<p>bharata of Amaracandra Süri (13th century A. D.), and the Pāndavacarita of Maladhāri Devaprabha (16th century A. D.), and (3) the various commentaries on the epic, like the Jhāna. dipika of Devabodha (early 11th century A. D.7), which is, incidentally, the oldest available commentary, the Vişamasloki of
Vimalabodha (between A. D. 1150 and A. D. 1300), the Bhārata i rthaprakāśa of Sarvajña Nārāyaṇa, the Bharatārthapradipikā of
Arjunamiśra (15th century A. D.), the Laksālanikāra of Vădirāja (16th century A.D.), and the Bhāratabhāvadipa of Nilakaotha (17th century A. D.).
It is on the basis of all this elaborate critical apparatus that | the text of the epic is finally constituted. It is neither possible
nor necessary to dilate. here, upon the canons which have governed the copstitution of the text in the critical edition. Some broad indications may, however, be given here. The first principle of the Mahābhārala textual criticism is to accept as original a reading or a feature, which is documented uniformly by all manuscripts alike. In other words, in order that a reading or a feature should be regarded as authentic, it must satisfy the condition of the originality of agreement between what may be proved to be inore or less independent versions. The rule arising out of such agreement between independent recensions or versions, which may be stated as N=S=constituted text, is easy to compre hend and simple to apply: only its sphere of operation is rather restricted. Difficulties arise when there is fluctuation; and that is the normal state. When there is such fluctuation, the choice falls, as a corollary of the previous rule, upon a reading which is documented by the largest number of more or less independent versions, and which is supported by intrinsic probability. The presumption of originality in these cases is frequently confirmed by a lack of definite agreement between the discrepant versions. Uccasionally we get « double&rdquo; agreement, that is, agreement
etween two or more groups of each recension; for instance, the Sarada and the Kashmiri versions of the Northern recension agree with the Malayālam version of the Southern recension, and simul taneously, the Bengālī version of the Northern recension agrees
308
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
with the Telugu and the Grantha versions of the Southern recen sion. In these circumstances, one of the agreements must, generally speaking, be accidental, since both can hardly be original; and either may de adopted if they have equal intrinsic merit. However, owing to the much greater correctness and reliability of the Sarada and the Kashmiri versions, the readings of this group have, as a rule, been adopted in the critical edition, other things being equal.
The general tendency in the course of the transmission of an ancient text is to simplify a difficult word or expression. A common rule of textual criticism, therefore, is that a lectio difficilior is more origipal than a lectio facilior. Similarly, grammatically irregular forms are more original thap regularised variants. This holds good also in the case of the Mahabharata. Therefore, solecisms, when shown to be original by a clear agree ment on this point between independent versions, have been all owed to stand uncorrected. In this connection it should be remembered that the original text of the epic may not have been necessarily a correct text or a felicitous text throughout. Attention may also be drawn, at this stage, to another rule of textual criticism, namely, that a textus simplicior is generally more origi pal than textus ornatior. Further, as a general rule, preference is given to a reading which best suggests how the other readings may have arisen. Another important rule which the editors of the Mahābhārata have scrupulously observed is that, irrespective of the result that it may lead to, the objective documentary evidence must be, as far as possible, the final deciding factor in the constitution of the text. In other words, interpretation must be given precedence over emendation. Accordingly, emendation has played a very inconspicuous role in the critical edition. Actually it has been resorted to merely for the purpose of unify. ing divergent and conflicting manuscript evidence, never in opposition to clear and unanimous testimony of manuscripts. The editors have always been careful not to force their subjective views in the matter of the constitution of the text. Wherever the manuscript evidence in respect of a line, phrase, word, or word.
THE MAHẤBHARATA AND ITS CRITICAL EDITION 309
part is equally balanced, this fact is indicated by a wavy line printed under that element of the text. A wavy line is thus used when the transmitted readings appear to be obviously corrupt or when the Northern and the Southern receasions offer two different readings of equal value or when the evidence pro et contra of documentary and intrinsic probability is equally balanced. Inci dentally it may be added that the high hopes entertained by some scholars that the Parvasamgrahaparvan would supply a decisive clue for the reconstruction of the original Mahabharata have been found to be not well founded.
What did the critical edition aim at and what does it claim for itself? To begin with, it must be pojated out that the critical edition did not aim - indeed, it could not have aimed - at presenting anything like the original copy of the epic as Vyāsa may bave written it. It did not also aim at a reconstruction of the Ur-Mahābhārata, that ideal but impossible desideratum. It did not, again, seek to reproduce the text of the poem as recited by Vaišampāyana before Janamejaya or even by the Sūta before Saunaka. The critical edition modestly aimed at presenting a text of the epic as old as the extant manuscript material permitted with some semblance of confidence. If the editorial work has been done properly, the critical edition may claim to embody the most ancient text of the epic accordiog to the direct line of transmission - a text which is purer than others in so far as it is free from the obvious errors of copying and spurious additions, The constituted text may claim to be the ancestor of all the extant manuscripts of the epic. As indicated above, the constituted text is not necessarily a correct text from the grammatical point of view por a felicitous text from the literary point of view. It contains loose and archaic lipguistic forms and constructions, apacoluthons and lack of syntactical concord. There remain many contradictions and superfluities. There is an evident lack of literary finish. These features - and aren&rsquo;t they natural in dynamic poetry? - must have been inherent in the old poem. Where they are met with in the critical text, they are documented by the manuscripts themselves or at least are inferable from them310
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
with a high degree of probability. The critical edition has only cleansed the text of the Mahābhārata of puerile modern accretions and obvious errors of repetition. On the other hand, it has rescued from undeserved oblivion many an authentic archaism. which had been gradually ousted in the course of the transmission of the text.
The critical edition of the Mahābhārata claims to be an edition in the preparation of which all the important extant versions of the Great Epic have been taken into consideration and all important manuscripts collated, estimated, and turned to account; it is, further, an edition in the preparation of which the various collateral testimonia have also been critically utilized, Another important feature of this edition is this : Since all diver gent readings of any importance are given in the critical notes printed at the foot of the page, this edition, for the first time, renders it possible for the reader to bave before him the entire significant evidence for each individual passage. The value of this method for scientific javestigation of the epic is obvious. Further, since not even the seemingly most irrelevant line or stanza actually found in a Mahābhārata manuscript collated for the edition is on any account omitted, this edition of the Maha bhārata is, in a sease, more complete than any previous edition, It is a veritable thesaurus of the Mahabharata tradition,

<li>Characteristics of Eastern Culture
It would be convenient if I begap by defining, to a certain extent, the implications of the terms, “Eastern,&rdquo; &quot; Culture,&rdquo; and “Characteristics,&rdquo; so far as the present paper was concerned. It has now become almost trite to say that the categorisation of thought and culture as Eastern&rsquo; and Western&rsquo; is not at all scientific. There are, as we all know, great and fundamental differences between the various ideologies that have originated apd grown in the geographical East. The cultural matrix of China, Japan, Indonesia, India, and Asiatic Russia can by no means be regarded as a single entity which may be analysed and studied as such. Similarly the differences between the Latin and the Germanic cultures as also between the cultures of the European continent on the one hand and those of the Americas on the other cappot be certainly overlooked. Further it has been osten pointed out that there is hardly anything in the so-called Oriental thought which cannot be found in the wide range of Occidental thought, and, conversely, there is nothing in the traditional Western thought which has not found expression in the Orient. Notwithstanding all this, in view of the fact that the ways of life and thought of peoples are invariably conditioned by their anthropo-geographical situations and the course of their history, and mainly as a convenient point of departure for a comparative study of their thought and culture, it may not be ahogether unwarranted to speak in terms of the Eastern tradition and the Western tradition. It would, however, be advisable to remind ourselves, jo this connection, of what has been so very well said, namely, that we might divide in order to distinguish if we did not distinguish in order to divide.</li>

Even a casual student of the history of Indian culture will be struck by what TOYNBER calls the religious penchant of that culture. With a view to bringing this penchant into relief, one may as well contrast it with the mechanical and technological penchant of the modern Western civilisation or the aesthetic penchant of the Hellenic civilisation. This religious penchant or the spiritual attitude of the Indian finds a very striking expression in the motivation of Indian philosophy. Indian philosophy, as has been often rightly emphasised, springs from the unrest of the soul rather than from any metaphysical curiosity. In the West, philosophy is a kind of scholastic Occupation or academic game; it is often isolated from life and consists of purely theoretical speculations. As against this, the Indians have sought to give a practical orientation to their philosophical thought. They aim at spiritually realising what is intellectually known. After the three stages in one&rsquo;s progress on the path of philosophy, namely, śrayana (knowledge derived through study), manana (cogita tion), and nididhyāsa (constant and repeated meditation), säksātkāra (direct realisation) is invariably mentioned as the final goal. Koowledge is barren unless it is transformed into vision ( darśana) or experience. This pragmatic view of philo sopby has resulted in the so-called systems of Indian philosophy subordinatiog their theoretical differences to the ultimate spiritual
s goal. Philosophy is after all a means to not an end in itself.
And this leads us to another significant attitude of the Indians, pamely, tolerance. Philosophy and religion not being regarded as ends in themselves, there is in India do scope for philosophical or religious dogma. There may be various roads which can take one to the ultimate goal of spiritual realisation, and any talk of exclusiveness in this regard is generally repulsive to the ladian mind In the course of her long history, India has,

accordingly, welcomed different races and religious cults without having ever entertained the idca of aggressively converting them to any specific way of life and thought Thus hospitality, this elementary good manners 10 matters of spirit, to use RADHA KRISHNAN&rsquo;s felicitous phrase, has characterised the Indian tradi. tion through the centuries
But the non individualistic attitude must perhaps be regarded as the most basic attitude of the Indian The genesis of this attitude has of course to be traced back to his cosmic Weltans. chauung The Western thought is essentially anthropo centric &ldquo;Man is the measure of all things&rsquo;. this dictum of Protagoras has oriented the entire outlook of the West As agajost this, in India, man is regarded as just a part of the cosmic whole in the same way as an animal or a tree Man is just one of the many forms in which the Supreme Bcing becomes manifest in this Universe An Upanısadıc seer has put this 10 a ycry telling manner He proclaims that the essential self or the vital essence in man is the same as that in ant, the same as that in gnat, the same as that in elephant, the same as that in these three worlds, indeed, the same as that in the whole universe Co ordination (or setting side by side ) of the various aspects of creation, 10 cluding man, and not subordination to man of other things is the guiding principle of the Indian thought No unique position is ascribed to man in the cosmic scheme of things The Indian man, therefore, acver assumes any domincering attitude in life On the contrary, he is ever eager to siok bis individuality in the ocean of cosmic totality. Humility or surrender before reality comes naturally to the Indian He realises that what is called

life is after all a state of temporary and, from the ultimate point of view, apparent disintegration or standing aparthe, therefore, seeks to achieve te integration through Yoga and mysticism
It is on account of this son individualistic attitude that India has failed to produce any real work of history as we understand at today That is also why in Jodia one speaks not in terms of individual philosophers but of schools of philosophy All interest is concentrated on ideas and not on individuals on principles and not on personalities In India individuality has, indeed, been never regarded as a problem worthy of senous consideration As against this, the West has consistently opposed the rejection of individuality However, in recent times, Western individualism has been stoutly challenged by the new ideals of collectivism and socialization And therein we see one aspect of the present crisis in the West
A natural consequence of the Indian non individualism is Indian non activism Individualistic West is aggressively activistic The Western man has been trying to understand nature with a view to ultimately being able to control and direct her forces And the success that he has so far achieved in this his endeavour has prompted him to further activism While detachment&rsquo; 15 the watchword of the Indian s behaviour the Westerner takes deep interest in this life and seeks to make it more and more happy and useful The Indian transcends all this worldly values, be regards them as being merely subservient to the values of another better existence He sees no salvation in the exclusively humanistic ideal of the West &ndash; in its anxiety to remould human society or to reform the state While the West believes that if anything is to be perfected it is this life and this world with all its complexities, the Indian is convinced that there is nothing per manent - either physical or psychical - In this temporal world, nothing enduring, and that, therefore, instead of striving to change this world one would do well to aspire for another better existence

The non-activistic and essentially contemplative Indian has consequently lagged far behind the West in the matter of scientific knowledge and matcrial progress. But, thereby, India and the East may be said to have escaped, to a large cxtcnt, another aspect of thc crisis which the West is now facing. On the onc hand, the West is feeling frustrated at the thought that, with all its knowledge and equipment, it has not succeeded in bringing peace and contentment to this world, where, on the contrary, tension is growing day by day in every splicrc of lifc; and, on the other, instead of remaining the master of its activistic impulse, the West has become almost its sfasc. The means of production and the products have, for instance, tended to dominate the producer. The economics of the non-activistic India Hould preach the desir ability of reducing the needs rather than of increasing the pro duction.
At this stage I may incidentally refer to an apparent locon gruity. I have spoken above of detachment and religiosity as the distinctive features of the Indian way of life and thought. Para doxical as it may sccm, the Indian tradition is by no means devoid of litcrature and art characterised by carcirce sensuous abandon and of religions glorifying orgiastic cults. Indeed, this polarity itself must be mentioned as a characteristic ladian attitude. Or course, this polar attitude is not to be vicucd, as it is sometimes donc, as being the result of the Indian ideology being primitive at the base and highly cultured in devclopment. Rather the two poles - attachment&rsquo; and &lsquo;aloofness&rsquo;, &lsquo;abandon&rsquo; and asceti cism&rsquo;-are to be understood as being indicative of the essential Dature of one single integrated wholc. In the cosmic-magic ideology, the two extremes of asceticism and sexuality, of capas and kāma, arc regarded as being by no means exclusivc; in an ideal situation, they may co-exist and thereby engender a lind of superb spiritual balance. In the Hindu mythology, Siva, who is celc brated as the most prc.cminent among the Yogins and the ascetics, is also represented as being ever united with his spouse Sakti who is the centre of rcligious orgies.</li>

Turning now to the way of approach to the problems of life and reality, it may, at the very outset, be broadly pointed out that the Western approach is intellectualistic, analytic, and regulative, while the Indian approach is intuitive, synoptic, and conformistic. The Western man believes that there can be no knowledge which cannot be expressed by means of verbal and logical symbols. Knowledge, according to him, is a body of strict concepts, and the categories of reason necessarily coincide with those of reality. He revels in setting forth all knowledge in a systematic frame work. To him reason is the only test of reality; formal logic is his very god. On the other hand, in conformity with his general attitude, the Indian regards nyāja (logic) as subservient to reli gion. The aim of logic is not so much epistemological as religious. The Indian has also fully realised the limitations of logic. He, no doubt, accepts the validity of reason, but he positively believes that the ultimate reality is beyond the reach of discursive and demonstrative logic. He is naturally unwilling to accept the absoluteness of any system of thought; for, according to him, truth manifests itself in many ways, and dogma is but the re flection of intellectual vanity. Further, the Indian believes that, in the ultimate analysis, all logical systems are based on the
relativity&rsquo; and uncertainty of human experience.
Like the individualism and the activism of the West, its uncompromising intellectualism also has caused a major crisis in Western life. Logical positivism has collapsed before relativity, and the undeniable evidence of the irrational, produced by modern psychology, has brought about the fall of reason from its high pedestal, India has sought to overcome this inevitable intellectual indeterminateness by postulating sabda (scriptural authority) as a valid source of loowledge. The Indian has deep faith in the scriptures, which, according to him, embody the results of the supra-rational perception and intuitive ex perience of the ancient sages. Sensual perception (pratyahşa) and logical inference (anumāna ) are necessarily limited in scope. for, the capacity of the human senses and of the human intellect is obviously limited. But, at this stage, the Indian exhibits a
THE EAST AND THE WEST
319
remarkable epistemological optimism. He firmly believes that where pure intellectualism fails, faith often functions effectively.&rdquo; In this connection, it may also be pointed out that, for his progress on the path to the direct realisation of reality, the Indian takes the aid of such non-intellectualistic disciplines as Yoga. As against this, the Westerner is critical of everytbing; he hesitates to put faith in anything; for him gothing is sacred by virtue of itself. Therefore, he suffers from a terrible intellectual frustration,
The attitudes of the Indian and his way of approach to the problems of life and reality have inevitably influenced his thought and practices. Indian cosmology, for instance, accepts the essential oneness of all aspects of being. There is no qualitative difference between one entity and another. According to one phase of the early Vedic thought, the same magical potence, asu, permeates through everyone and everything - god, man, animal,, trees, etc. &ndash; and the apparent manifoldness of form and type is due to quantitative differences. The later doctrine of advaita is but a metaphysical expression of this original cosmic-magic view. It is further believed that the universe, vast and complex as it is, is by no means chaotic; it is governed and regulated by an all pervasive universal law, Rra. Nothing is higher than this cosmic law. Even gods are subservient to it and capaot outgrow it.
Indian metaphysics cannot be defined in the usual terms of idealism, materialism, realism, etc. The manifold phenomenal manifestations are apparent, transitory, and contingent; they are

6. Jacidentally, attention may be drawn in this context to a peculiar feature of India&rsquo;s religio-philosophical ideology. Though the Indian has accepted fabda or scripture as the ultimately valid source of knowledge, the religious thought and practice in lodia have by no mocans ternained static on that account, through the various periods of her long history. Unlike many other religions, Hinduism was never bound down by the “ Loub ' and the &ldquo;Prophct.&rdquo; It would seem that fabda-frutanga had but louted application - it was accepted only as an epistemological device - and that frequcat changes were wrought to religious concepts and precepts so as to make them conform to the changing times.

deeper fundamental plane it has proved to be remarkably dynamic. As for the second vicw, it is necessarily partial and tendentious. Many European historians, and others who had come under their influence, believed that Europe was the scene of the origin and growth of real culture and could, therefore, alone be a proper subject of history They, therefore, deliberately refused to study the history of the Eastern civilisations. The erstwhile popular assumption of the Hellenistic origin of Indian drama, art, medi cine, etc, for instance, was but an ego-centric illusion of the Western mind The correct view would be that, in the course of history, the Indian culture and the Western culture had influenced each other in several ways,
How can the fact and the nature and extent of the influence of one culture upon another be determined ? Direct, specific, and unequivocal evidence in this regard is obviously not always possible. We have often to depend on the evidence which is circumstantial and inferential. It is also not possible to state in very precise terms the various aspects of such infuence, One point needs to be specially emphasised in this connection. Similarities or resemblances between two cultures, however striking, are not always a sure criterion of the influence of one culture upon the other. Similarities may be accidental. Side shoots sprouting out from two different stems are, pot unoften, seen to approximate one another as a matter of course. Similar ideologies and practices may also evolve independently in two different areas. Similar problems faced by the human intellect on similar backgrounds may be tackled independentlly but in similar ways Such similar-looking cultural growths are really
parallel,&rsquo; It is further not unlikely that the influence of a common third source, and not mutual contact, is the cause of some resemblances. Some resemblances may, again, be only apparent and superficial. The apparently similar concepts may have actually originated from entirely different contexts and on entirely different planes The cosmic non-individualism of India, for instance, cannot by any means be regarded as being similar to the collectivistic or socialistic non-individualism of the modern
THE &lsquo;EAST AND THE WEST
323
West. Similarly, the claim that the sages of ancient India had anticipated in their speculations some of the results of modern science (e. g. coormous number of years from the beginning of creation to the present yuga; infinite number of worlds existing outside our own; presence of worlds even in the space of an aton; etc.) must be regarded as untenable. Lastly, it must be pointed out that partial resemblances are always deceptive.
We may, however, set forth some workable criteria for our present purpose. The Indian way of life and thought is essentially traditional in character. It is seen that even original thinkers have been chary of afirming the originality of their contributions; they have always tried to fit in their contributions into the traditional pattern. Whatever, therefore, seems not to belong to the traditional pattern may be regarded as the result of foreign jofluence. So too, whatever is peculiar to a particular author or school - that is to say, whatever was generally not knows or accepted before that author or school and is generally not known or accepted after that author or school - may be the result of foreign influence. It might be further assumed that borrowing would normally occur in those spheres of life and thought in which India had not made sufficient advance. Generally speak ing, no foreign borrowing or influence might be expected in the fields of philosophy, religion, literature, etc. It has also to be remembered that the influence of one culture upon another may either be general and of a more or less permanent character, or it may be limited to a particular sphere of life and to a particular historical period. In many cases, Western ideas and ideals, being exotic, have failed to strike root in traditional India. What is, however, perhaps most important in this context is that it should be possible to account for the phenomenon of influence Tationally and in conformity with the history and cultural develop ment of Iodia.
The first principal landmark in the history of the intercourse between lodia and the West must be said to be represented by the obvious relationship between the Indus valley civilisation and the contemporary civilisations of Western Asia. A more or less324

uniform culture-complex may be presumed to have extended from the Mediterranean to the Indus in the fourth and the third millennia B.C. A little later the Indo-European-speaking tribes from the West and the North migrated into the North-Western region of India. These people, popularly known as the Vedic Aryans, brought with them their own language, religion, and culture, which, in course of time, proved to be some of the most fundamental factors in the evolution of the Tadian culture. Words of Babylo nian and Chaldean origin occurring in the Veda, rare as they are have also to be understood as implying some contact between India on the one hand and Babylon and Chaldea on the other. Similarly, the early Dravidian language and culture show unmistakable affinities with the prehistoric cultures of Anatolia, Armenia, and Iran The Lycians of Asia Minor, in their inscriptions, called themselves Trimmlai, which word is presumably related to dramila or Tamil A large number of ancient place-names in that region are shown to conform to Dravidian forms. The Hurrian and the Kassite languages also show great alioity with the Dravidian. These linguistic affinities between Western Asia and South India are clearly confirmed by cultural affinities.12 A more direct evidence is available of vigorous trade gojog on between the Phoenicians of the Levant and the merchants of Southern and Western India found about 975 B, C.
More siguifcapt, however, from our present point of view is the period of the contacts between India and Greece. It must be pointed out that, in this context, Greece has to be understood in a wider sense as comprising Greece and Greek colonies in Asia Minor, Egypt, Italy, and Sicily, while India has to be understood io a far too restricted seose as being coextensive only with the region of the lodus. The connecting link between India apd Greece in this carly period was the Persian empire. It is histori cally attested that the Persian emperor Darius sent a Greek mercenary, called Scylax, to sail down the river Indus to its mouth, in about 510 B. C. It is not unlikely that Herodotus

THE EAST AND THE WEST
325
(born 484 B. C.), who gives several significant details about India, has utilized the accounts of Scylax&rsquo;s adventures. Ctesias (401 B, C.), another Greek who had travelled in India, wrote quite a lot about this country, but his descriptions are rather fanciful. But, even before the times of Darius, India seems to have heard and known of the Greeks, la this connection, it is significant that the great grammarian of Sanskrit, Pānioi, refers to the script of the Yavanas (lonians) in a familiar way. A mention may also be made here of the interesting tradition, which Eusebius attributes to Aristoxenus (330 B. C.), namely, that an Indian Pandit actually visited Athens and conversed with Socrates. The Indian Pandit, it is said, asked Socrates what he was occupied with. On being told by Socrates that his work consisted in inquiriog into the life of man, the Indian Pandit smilingly retorted that none could hope to understand things human who had not understood things divide. It is generally believed that Alexander&rsquo;s raid on the Indus region (4th cent. B. C.) facilitated deeper and more extensive contacts between India and the West. But the raid itself did not make any discernible impact on the history of Indian culture. The Hellenistic intrusion into India must be said to have really begon with Demetrius, the Greek king of Bactria, who crossed the Hindu Kush in 190 B.C. And, even after the Greek principalities in that region had come to an end, the Hellenistic influence on India continued through the “Philhellenic” sakas, Parthians, and Kuşānas (2nd cent. B. C. to 1st cent. A. C.).
During the first centuries A. C., Alexandria had developed into a great cosmopolitan cultural centre. According to a tradition, the Alexandrians honoured a Buddhist monk from Bhțgukaccha and listened to him with as much attention as to Saint Paul. There is also evidence of brisk trade and other contacts between South India and the Roman Empire.194 Similarly some Indian rulers are known to have appointed

So far as the Hellenistic contacts with India are concerned, broadly speaking, before Alexander&rsquo;s campaign, thought seems to have travelled - mainly, and quite understandably - from the East towards the West Though positive evidence in this connection is mostly lacking there is a strong probability of the Indian thought having rafluenced the Greek philosophers Chronology and historically demonstrable contacts would seem to support the assumption of such influence Thales, the father of Greek philosophy postulated water as the basic element It is not unlikely that in this postulation he was influenced by the Vedic concept of primeval waters Similarly the Upanisadıc theory of one single Reality underlyiog the phenomenal manifoldness may be presumed to have been the source of the speculations of the Eleatic school The entire body of the religio philosophical and mathematical teaching of Pythagoras had been known in India

already in the 6th century B. C., and the biographer of Pythagoras tells us that the latter bad travelled exteosively and had thereby become familiar with the thought of the Brāhmaṇas among others. The afinities between the Orphic school and India&rsquo;s transcendental philosophy are self-evident, and, if any influence is to be presumed, India must be regarded as the source of that influence. The same thing may be said in connection with Neoplatonism on the one hand and Vedānta, Yoga, and Buddhism on the other. In this context, one may usefully refer to the verdict of Clement of Alexandria who proclaimed that the Greeks bad stolen their philosophy from the barbarians. According to Lucianus (2nd cent, A. C.) also, philosophy had beea first cultivated in India before it came to Greece. Further, it is well known that gnosticism is often characterised as &ldquo;Orientalism in Hellenic Mask.&rdquo;
As suggested above, the flow of culture definitely changed its course from the time of Alexander onwards. It was the Western thought and culture which now began to influence the East. Some aspects of this jofluence, so far as it operated on lodia&rsquo;s cultural development, may be noted here.
The polity of the Mauryan age (4th century B. C.), as reflected in the Arthasāstra of Kautilya, exhibits certain features which are alien to the traditional political thought of Jodia. 180 According to the traditional view, the highest sanction in social and political matters vested in Dharma. In the Indian theory of government, both Brahman, the spiritual authority (normally symbolised by the Brāhmana Purohita ), and Kşatra, the temporal power ( normally symbolised by the Ksatriya ruler), were, in the ultimate analysis, always subordioated to Dharma. Indeed, sacerdotium and regnum were both regarded as but instruments of Dharma. As against this, according to the Arthaśāstra of Kautilya, from among the four sources of authority, namely, Dharma, civil and criminal law, custom, and royal edict, each

succeeding one was superior in validity to each preceding one.14 This kind of absolute exaltation of the king&rsquo;s authority was unknown to ancient Indian tradition. Nor can it be said to have been generally accepted in the post-Mauryan periods. It clearly marks a deviation from the cosmic non-individualistic ideology of India. It may, therefore, be presumed that Kautilya derived this concept of monarchic absolutism from the political ideas and ideals of the Persians and the Greeks. The intercourse between India and the West had become closer and the interchange of ideas more active and vigorous in the period immediately following Alexander&rsquo;s Indian campaign. And it is, indeed, not unlikely that, when Kautilya says that he has formulated his political theories on the basis of traditional sciences (sästra) and actual practices (prayoga),15 the practices intended by him are the political practices obtaining in the Persian and the Greek empires. Incidentally, a reference may be made in this connec tion to the view of STEIN that the chapter in Kautilya&rsquo;s Artha Šāstra, which deals with the Sāsanādlukāra (II. 10), bears á composite appearance and shows signs of having been remodelled in the light of Roman Imperial letters of a later time, 15a
Another teaching of Kautilya, which does not seem to fit in well into the pattern of India&rsquo;s traditional polity, relates to the vast bureaucratic governmental machinery with centralised control.16 The Maurya rulers are known to have actually tried to translate this teaching into practice. The Mauryan state, which sought to plan, control, and direct the entire social and economic life of the nation, departed fundamentally from the traditional practice of not interfering actively in the daily avoca. tions of the people. In this matter, Kautilya must have obviously received inspiration from the Hellenistic concept of the State. As ROSTOVZEFF says, through such radical centralisation of government, Candragupta and Kautilya did more to &ldquo;hellenise&rdquo; India than Demetrius and Menander.17

Another field in which the Hellenistic influence becomes perfectly evident is art. In the Gāndhāra art, which is also significantly called Graeco-Buddhist art, the subject is Buddhistic while the style of execution is undeniably Hellenistic. This art was actually sponsored only after the direct Greek domination in the North-Western region had ended, and was patronised mainly by the Sakas and the Kuşānas who continued the tradition of their Hellenistic predecessors. The traditional cosmic non individualistic outlook of the Indians did not encourage the sculptures of individual isolated figures. It must have been the contact with the anthropocentric West which had inspired the sculpture of the figures of the Buddha. Indeed, the religious penchant of the Indian culture united with the aesthetic penchant of the Hellenistic culture produced this one of the most sublime and creative schools of art. It must, however, be pointed out that the later specimens of the Gāndhāra art were characterised by a lack of sympathy, sincerity, and spontaneity. The artists tended to indulge in a kind of mechanical mass-production of sculptural figures. Such mechanical approach and attitude were unknown in India, and their origin also has to be traced to the Western influence.
The Western influence on the ancient Indian coinage is equally conspicuous. A type of coins previously unknown to India came to be introduced by the Bactrian Greeks. These coins had the names and portraits of the rulers inscribed upon them. This may be presumed to have been the result of the influence of the anthropocentric West. The earlier Indian coins had been mostly punch-marked. The Hellenistic character of this gew coinage becomes evident from two facts: first, instead of the figures of the rulers, these coios sometimes show the figures of the divinities belonging to the Greek pantheon; and second, the pames Dinara and Dramma, given to some of these coins, are obviously Indian forms of Greek Dinarius and Drachma. The standardisation of the new coinage in respect of form, character, and weight was also something which had been unknown in India in the earlier periods, and must, therefore, be presumed to have been due to foreiga influence.

Astronomy may be mentioned as still another sphere in which the lodian thought was influenced by the Greek and the Roman theories In this connection, the view expressed by Varaha mıhıra is highly significant This distinguished Indian writer on astronomy of the 6th century A C says &ldquo;The science of astronomy is well established among the Yavanas Therefore, though they are barbarians, they must be respected like our own ancient sages 18 Alberuni refers to another writer, earlier than Varahamihira who records high praise of Greek scholars As a matter of fact after the 3rd century A C, the influence of Greek and Roman knowledge in various sciences began to be effectively felt among the learned circles in India It is, therefore, not surprising that two of the five principal schools of astronomy came to be named Romaka (after Rome) and Paulisa ( after Paul of Alexandria, 378 A C)
The contacts between India and the West, which, in the earlier periods of history, had been more or less occasional and brief, have tended to become steady and permanent in recent years Consequently, the influence of the West on the Indian way of life and thought in modern times, has proved to be compa ratively deeper and more extensive It is but natural that, in this context, one has to think primarily of the lado British intercourse during the last two hundred years or so A few characteristics of this Indo British impact may be stated here To begin with, it would be seen that the British influence began to operate 10 India from above downwards The large masses of the Indians semained almost unaffected by that influence, at least in the initial stages of the intercourse between the British and the Indians Whatever influence there had been was, accordingly, only superficial Attention may also be drawn to the attitude of the Early Europeans who came to India They were all inspired by a purely mercenary and adventurist spirit They looked upon India as colonie d exploration and not as colonie de peuplement In this respect, they differed fundamentally from the ancient

Indians who had colonised in the different regions of South-East Asia. By way of contrast, two features of this ancient Indian colonisation may be particularly emphasised. Firstly, these colonies had little or no political connection with the metropolitan India; and secondly, these colonies never entertained the idea of economically exploiting those various regions for the sake of the mother-country. On the other hand, those regions themselves became independent Indias in miniature.
The dealings with the Indians of the early British officers were actuated by a sense of racial superiority and scorn for everything Indian. Their ignorance of the heritage of India and of the East was colossal. MACAULAY was perhaps the most shining example of this kind of racial and cultural arrogance. When such an attitude is in evidence, the process of cultural give-and take is necessarily retarded. A tribute must, however, be paid, at this stage, to the great service rendered by the European Orienta lists in India and in the West to the cause of the wider and fuller appreciation of India&rsquo;s art, philosophy, and literature. But, in actual practice, the influence of the Orientalists was quite limited in extent. On the whole, therefore, the early intercourse between the English and the Indians may be said to have proved sterile. As a matter of fact, neither then por later did the English make any attempt - though they were in a position to do so - to develop a new form of civilisation, a sort of Indo-British civilisa tion, in India. Whatever influence India has received from the West, during this period, is mostly due to the initiative of the Indians themselves.
While considering the impact of the English on India, one must also not forget that the Indian civilisation and the Western civilisation are essentially different in ethos. As indicated else where, the attitude of the Indians and their approach to the various problems of life were quite distinct from those of the West. Many features of the Western civilisation failed to be appreciated by the Indian mind; they were exotic and did not strike root in the Indian soil.

The reaction of the Indians to the impact of the Western culture in modern times may be said to have been fourfold. There were some Indians who had been completely swayed by the Western way of life and thought. Their entire outlook was Westernised-so much so that they were dominated by a sense of revolt against the Indian tradition. Indeed, as converts to the new ideology they exhibited greater fanaticism than the Westergers themselves. The other extreme was represented by the people who wanted to repudiate everything that was foreign These people believed that there could be nothing richer and nobler than the traditional Indian culture and that those who were even slightly inclined towards the Western way of life and thought were paving the way to perdition for India Their reaction to the impact of the West often bordered on obscurantism. Even at the remotest hint of anything foreign they withdrew themselves into the closed shell of ancient traditions. The third kind of reaction was resignation to the new situation There was a class of people - and the majority of people belonged to this class &ndash; who passively accepted the things as they came. They did not bother themselves about either the mending or the ending of the new dispensation. The thought-leaders from among the newly educated middle class, however, saw the possibility of a fruitful blending of the Eastern and the Western cultures. They might have differed from one another in respect of the emphasis in the new synthesis on one culture or the other. But they generally aimed at evolving a new culture which would be essentially Indian in spirt though Western in form and expression. They also hoped that, as the result of this dynamic synthesis, they would be able to fight away their Western rulers by means of the very weapons which the latter had made available to them,
Some of the actual results of the influence of the British on Indian life may now be briefly stated here. With the foundation in 1857. under the auspices of the British government, of the three Universities - at Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras - the doors of knowledge may be said to have been, for the first time, opened to all lodiaps irrespective of sex, class, or creed. For instance, the
THB EAST AND THE WEST
333
study of the real language of the Indian culture, namely, Sanskrit, which had till then been restricted to a specific class, could now be pursued by anybody in the Universities and the secondary schools. This was, indeed, a tremendous experiment to universalise education - at least in theory. The content and the methodology of the new education were also mostly derived from the English pattera. Education, it was realised, must inculcate among the students an attitude of inquiry as against the traditional attitude of acceptance. Mere line-by-lipe study of ancient texts, intensive as it had been, was found to be static and non-productive. An attempt was, therefore, made under Western inspiration, to make the study of any subject dynamic and broad-based by adopting critical, comparative, and historical methods. As a result, the new scientific literature was not restricted to being merely interpretative; it also tended to become creative. The aim of education, it came to be reiterated, was not, as formerly under stood, only the conservation of ancient knowledge; it was also the acquisition - and more particularly the creation - of new kaowledge. The scope of study in schools and Universities was, accordingly, considerably enlarged by the addition of new subjects.
In the field of public administration, several centuries after the Mauryas, the British again sponsored a vast bureaucracy with centralised control. However, their two most remarkable contributions in this sphere must be said to be the setting up of all-India services and the insistence on the absolute authority and universality of law. These two went a long way in integra ting India iolo a politically homogeneous unit.
India has had and still continues to have mostly an agrarian economy. But the industrial revolution, which the country has witoessed during recent years, is, without doubt, wholly due to the impact of the West. The impact of the West and the general world-situation have rudely shocked India out of her traditional non-activism. The Indians have now realised that they will not survive the new global struggle for existence unless they industria lise their country, and that they cannot industrialise their country334
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
unless they learn the sciences and technology of the West. Contrary to her traditional spirit, India is now aiming at raising the material standard of living of her people.
As for the influence of the West in the sphere of religion, I do not want to refer, in this paper, to the proselytizing activities of the Christian missionaries in India. Nor do I want to say anything about the ineffective attempts of the Portuguese to evolve a sort of an Indian-Christian civilisation, I want to mention quite another kind of influence. Though the traditional religious life of India seems to have been generally unaffected by the impact of the West, the Western thought has influenced the religious ideology of modern India - at least at certain levels - in various subtle ways. This influence has worked in four main directions, namely, rationalisation, liberalisation, universalisation, and activisation, Modern Indian thinkers have sought to reinterpret India&rsquo;s religio-philosophical ideas and ideals in terms of modern knowledge and aspirations, and thereby to render them appealing to the rationalistic disposition of the Western and the Western-educated Indian intellectuals. They have tried to dispel the general misunderstanding that Indian religions are crude conglomerations of superstitious beliefs and primitive practices. Tadia&rsquo;s religio-philosophical ideology, they assert, would effectively meet the claims of the metaphysical curiosity as well as of the spiritual quest of even the modern world. This was, indeed, what Swami VIVEKANANDA did - obviously under the Western influence; and this is what RADHAKRISHNAN is doing now.
Attempts were also made, again under the influence of the Western thought, through movements like the Brahmo Samaj, to rid the Hindu religion of its exclusive character. Caste distinc tions and worship of specific gods, which had been the hall-marks of this exclusiveness, were discarded, and all persons, irrespective of sex, caste, and creed, were brought together within the larger brotherhood of bhakti for a universal godhead. In some cases, the Indian theology was sought to be actually brought close to the Western theology. The Indians have been traditionally
THE EAST AND THE WEST
335
actuated by a spirit of tolerance in the field of both thought and practice. They were gencrally always willing to sacrifice the petty superficial differences in creed and cult at the altar of the ultimate spiritual goal. It was, therefore, by no means difficult to emphasise the liberal outlook and the universal aspect of Hinduism so as to make it conform to the new situation. But perhaps the most significant change which the Western impact brought about in the religious sphere was the social value with which religion came to be so emphatically reinvested. Religion, it was asserted, must not aim merely at individual salvation. Service to society was as much a religious duty as service to god. Religion and social reforms must not be regarded as antithetical. Indeed, the humanistic aspect of religion must be allowed to dominate over its denominational aspect. Such views definitely re-activised and re-vitalised lodian religion, and a new missionary zeal became evident in the sphere of religion, as exemplified by the Ramakrishna Mission and the Arya-Samaj.
It would not be an exaggeration to say that, even in their recent struggle for dependence, the Indians received their main inspiration from the West. For one thing, the contact with the West helped India to regaip her lost individuality. A new sense of nationalism and social solidarity was engendered among the Indians and spurred them on in their freedom struggle. Whether that struggle took the form of constitutional agitation or of secret revolutionary insurrection or of moral non-violent resistance, the leaders of the struggle invariably derived the impetus from the writings and doings of Westerners like ROUSSEAU, MILL, MAZZINI, TOLSTOY, THOREAU, and RUSKIN. Of course, in order to be able effectively to appeal to the patriotic instinct of their followers the lodian leaders had to fall back, from time to time, on the teachings of the Bhagavadgitā and the Buddha and on the heroic examples from the Epics and the historical annals of India.
What is the prospect of the influence of the West which has been operating in India in recent years? As indicated above, a new form of social compromise seems to be evolviog out of this Western impact. The Indians are avidly experimenting with the
336
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
various economic, political, and social systems and thought patterns of the West, but they are also becoming keenly aware of the serious crises which the individualistic, intellectualistic, and activistic West is facing today. They realise that, if they do not become divorced from the essential spirit of what may be called Indianism, they will still be able to avoid those crises. A new society with Western equipment seems inevitable, but in order that this new society should be enabled to survive the crises of the modern age it must have an Indian soul GANDHIJI, indeed, sounded a timely note of warning to his compatriots when he told them that they might allow winds from many quarters to blow over them but that they must not allow themselves to be swept off their feet by those winds

<p>It is customary to regard the Veda as the starting point of the entire ancient Indian way of life and thought. A critical consideration of the question regardiog the genesis of several significant concepts and practices which had prevailed in ancient India would, however, show that they could by no means be traced back to the Veda, either ideologically or from the point of view of literary documentation. It would appear that, long before the Vedic Aryans migrated into the land of the seven rivers on their avowed mission of conquest and colonisation, a distinct socio-religious pattern had evolved in the Indian sub continent. Unfortunately do direct literary sources are now available to enlighten us on this pre-Vedic non-Aryan pattern of life and thought. But the cumulative evidence of archaeology, anthropology, ethnology, and linguistics yields a more or less vivid picture in this respect. Moreover, this pre-Vedic pattern of life and thought had extended so far and wide and had become so firmly established on the Indian soil tbat it did not fail – indeed, it could not have failed – to influence the Vedic Aryan ideology itself in an uomistakable manner. In spite of the obviously deliberate attempts on the part of the Vedic (Brahma Dic) hierarchy to suppress these intuences, it was compelled, presumably on account of sheer popular pressure, to accommo date into its own pattern of life and thought some aspects of what was to it an alien way of life and thought, albeit in a modified - in some cases vitally and substantially modified - form. It is, indeed, only on such an assumption that the Occurrence in Brahmanism of certain concepts and practices, which are obviously non-Vedic in character, can be accounted for.
By way of illustration, attention may be drawn to the Siva religion and the practices and cults associated with it. The fact
338
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
that the existence of this religion is clearly evidenced in the Indus valley civilisation is sufficient to prove its pre Vedic non Aryan provenance Indeed, it can be shown that the worship of Siva, the red” god, had spread in several parts of India long before the penetration of the Vedic Aryans in those parts - different features of the character and the cult of that god having been emphasized in different regions The Sıva religion was essentially non Vedic in character It was obviously an iconic religion, while idol worship was entirely unknown to the Veda The formal worship of this pre Vedic god consisted, among other things, in besmearing his icon with some substance (püja) and offering raw oblations (balı directly before it As against this the typical Vedic form of worship was honia, that is, offering of ablations to gads through fire – the gods themselves not beiog actually present in the form of idols and it being believed that those oblations were conveyed to them by fire who was therefore called havja vahana carrier of oblations&rsquo; Further there were usually associated with the Sıva religion cults which glorified a life of repunciation, asceticism, wandering mendicancy, and severe austerities Some kind of yoga practices also seem to have figured prominently in these cults The Vedic Aryan ideal, on the other hand, was one of a materially secure and prosperous family life Similarly, the early Veda does not show any traces of joga In this connection we may indeed speak, 10 very broad terms, of two traditions – the pre Vedic non Aryan Muni Yatı tradition and the Vedic Aryan Rsi tradition The non Vedic character of the cults sponsored by the Siva religion is clearly sodicated by the antagonistic attitude, towards Yaris, of lodra, the chief god of the hieratic Vedic religion But it may be presumed that the Siva religion had been so very deeply rooted among large sections of the people that the protagonists of the hieratic Vedic religion found the pressure of that popular religion almost irresistible They were, therefore, obliged to accept, how soever reluctantly the Sıva religion and the cults associated with it The Vedic god Rudra for instance, is but an aryanised version of the proto Indian Siva It is significant that the various references to Rudra in the Vedic mythology and ritual isolat

339
that god from the other gods of the Vedic pantheon in a very conspicuous magner, One also gets the unmistakable impression that the cults of the Vrātyas, the Munis, and the Brahmacārins, which were closely allied to the Rudra-Siva-worship, followed a way of life which was fundamentally different from that of the Vedic Aryans.
All this would indicate how very inadequate it was to seek in the Veda the only or even the main fountain-head of Indian thought as a whole, It is, indeed, possible to point to some other concepts in Indian thought, such as atomism, for which it is not possible to posit any Vedic origin. Further, a critical study of some later systems of Indian philosophy like Samkhya, Yoga, Vaišesika, Buddhism, and Jainism would show that there existed in these systems a substratum of common concepts which were definitely not derived from the Veda but which might be traced back to a pre-Vedic Magadhan thought-complex. The traditions regarding the various lives of Gautama Buddha and the twenty three Jaina Tirthamkaras who preceded Mahavira are certainly quite significant in this connection. It would seem that the pre-Vedic current of thought with its many ramifications continued through centuries to serve as a significant source for the later Todjan thought to draw upon. The Vedic Aryan current of thought, which was, in a sense, foreign to the Indian soil, never succeeded - indeed it could not have succeeded - in superseding it completely. As a matter of fact, a large number of elements in the classical Hindu way of life and thought clearly betray a pre-Vedic non-Aryan origin. From this point of view, the Aryan Vedism may be regarded as a graod interlude in the continuity of ancient Indian thought.
The earliest literary manifestations of Indian thought are, however, to be found in the Veda. It should be remembered that the Veda, in respect of whose creation tradition denies the operation of any human agency, is not one single book. It has been very aptiy described as a whole library and literature. Its extent in point of the authorship, of the geography and chronology of composition, and of the form and contents is, indeed, vast. But
340
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
a critical student would notice that, in spite of its vastness and variety, there runs through the Veda a thread of logical develop ment which invests it with some kind of unity. From the point of view of literary form and contents, this literature, which is usually called the Veda, is broadly divided into three classes, the Samhitā, the Brahmana, and the Upanisad. These three classes also correspond to the three successive periods in the history of the Vedic literature and culture - each succeeding literary period being logically and historically the natural - indeed, the inc vitable - outcome of the preceding period. Long before they entered India, the Vedic Aryans, who had been living in the region round about Balkh together with their Iranian and Anatolian brethren, must have started producing prayers (mantras ) relating to their religion. The character of this religion was determined by the kind of life they had been living. At that early stage of their cultural history, the Vedic Aryans lived close to nature - as a part of it rather than apart from it. It was, therefore, the vastness and brilliance of oature, its blessings and maledictions, and, above all, the inexorable and subtly operating law which regulated all its manifestations, that dominated their religious ideology. The earliest mantras of the Vedic Aryans accordingly pertained to this cosmic religion, to which they gave expression through such mythological concepts as those of the divine parents, Dyāvā-Prthivi, the cosmic law, Ria, and the sustainer of that law, Asura Varuna Side by side with this cosmic religion, the Vedic Aryans had also developed a kind of simple fire-worship and elementary Soma-cult. The cosmic religion of the Vedic Aryans tended towards anthropo morphism but it was not idolatrous. Fire was, therefore, regarded as the liaison between gods and men.
la coursc of time, there occurred a distinct change in the condition of life of the Vedic Aryans and consequently in their religious ideology. They set out towards India on campaigns of conquest and colonisation, fought, on their way, a series of batiles with several antagonistic tribes whom they collectively called Disas and Výtras, and anally emerged as victorious
INDIAN PATTERN OF LIFE AND THOUGHT
341
colonisers of that part of India which was known as the land of the seven rivers. In this epoch-making warlike enterprise the Vedic Aryans were led by their heroic leader, Indra, whom they soon made into a god. The individual was gradually institutiona lised, and history came to be transformed into mythology. In this process of the mythologisation of history, several elements derived from the ancient primitive myth of the Hero and the Dragon were made use of. And later, as was but to be expected, the Vedic Aryan war-god also came to be invested with a cosmic character. Naturally enough, this hero-religion superseded the earlier cosmic religion almost completely, and consequently dominated the first regular collection of mantras, made by the Vedic poets and priests on the Indian soil, namely, the Rgveda,
Perbaps with a view to counteracting the growing influence of this essentially warlıke religion, which glorified military prowess, the Vedic poets and priests deified, in the form of Bphaspati-Brabmanaspati, who is in many respects modelled after Indra, the magical potency of their prayers and priestcraft.
Sun-worship, which also figures prominently in the Veda, is, in a sense, just an aspect of fire-worship. But a critical study of the Vedic mythology would also show that it had greatly influenced many a mythological concept sa the Veda with the result that dividities, which had originally nothing to do with the solar phenomena, came to be regarded as sun-gods at some stage in the evolution of their personality and character. For instance, Vişou, who had originally belonged to a popular religious cult but who was later elevated to the hieratic Vedic pantheon through the process of the hierarchisation of popular divinities, belongs to this category. Savitr, Mitra, and Püsan are other gods who have been subjected to the process of the solarisation of the originally non-solar divinities.
The religious speculations of the early Vedic Aryans manifest ed themselves mainly in two forms-mythology and cosmology, Like many other primitive communities, the Vedic Aryans believed that the creation of the universe and the procreation
342
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
of the human race were the result of a primeval sacrifice which was of the nature of the self immolation of a cosmic being This cosmic being is represented in the Rgieda as the hermaphrodite god man, Yama, or as the Virāt Purusa Apart from this concept of the primevat cosmic sacrifice as the starting point of creation, there are represepted jo the Rgveda two other significant currents of cosmological thought According to one of them, the source of all powers and existences, divide as well as earthly, was conceived as the &lsquo;golden germ&rsquo; - a form assumed by an unnamed ur god This golden germ is obviously the precursor of the golden egg of the later cosmogony The other cosmogonic theory is far more profound It seeks to controvert the generally prevalent view that the world has evolved out of &lsquo;gon betog&rsquo; or asat At the same time, this theory asserts that the source of this world cannot be, strictly speaking, characterised as being' or sat in the beginning there was a certain unapparent condition which, on account of the absence of distinctness, was not an *entity, and which, on account of its being the instrument of the creation of the world, could not also be regarded as a * D01 entity' Besides these cosmogonic theories, one comes across, even in the early Veda, other theosophic speculations regarding the problem of reality.
Side by side with the mythology, the cosmogony, the theo sophy, and the ritual of the classes' among the Vedic Aryans, which were embodied mainly in the Rgveda, there had also existed what may be called the religion of the masses' This religion, mainly represented in the Atharvayeda, comprised a variety of charms, imprecations, and exorcistic practices which were primarily intended to appease, to bless, and to curse. The motif recurring throughout this religion was, of course, magic
It would be seen that, in the first period of the cultural history of the Vedic Aryans as reflected in the Samhitās of the Rgseda and the Atharsaneda, the religious practices of the Vedic Aryans, in contrast with the manifold character of their religious thought, had been few and quite simple This was, indeed, in full conformity with their nomadic way of life When, how'

ever, they settled down and began to experience a sense of security and prosperity, their religion, naturally enough, tended to become increasingly complex, Out of a primitive form of ritual, which the Vedic Indians, like any other ancient commu nity, had already known, they now developed a very elaborate system of sacrifice. As a consequence of this, there arose, of necessity, a new class of priests who alone could master the many and highly complicated details of the sacrificial procedure and who indulged with great avidity in discussing those details, often in a hair-splitting maqner, in the Brāhmaṇa texts which they produced for that purpose. And, perhaps with a view to maintaining their hold over the contemporary religious thought and practices, these priests continued to load the ritual with still more details. They insisted on a scrupulous observance of all those details, so much so that such observance, iostead of being a means to an end, came to be looked upon as the end in itself. It must, however, be pointed out that the Brabmanic system of sacrifice did make a certain distinct contribution to the specula tive wisdom of India - though in an incidental manner. For instance, it sought to discover all kinds of symbolic tres or mystic bonds, bandhutā, between the various details of the sacrifice on the one hand and the different aspects of the cosmos on the other, and thereby tried to establish a kind of magico. ritualistic advaita. It also helped the growth of many sciences, such as phonetics, grammar, etymology, astronomy, etc., though the Brahmapic lucubrations in these fields can at best be described as pre-scientific science.'
The mechanical sacerdotalism evolved by the Brahmanic priests and represented in the Brāhmanas had its expected reaction. Some sections of the non-priestly classes, which had been reduced to the position of mere passive instruments in the hands of the priests, and the free-thinkers among the priests themselves, now began to question the efficacy of sacrifice as a means for attaining the true spiritual goal, as also to doubt the absolute authority of the scriptures which were pressed into service, often by circumvention, in order to establish that efficacy,344

The new shift, which was clearly reflected in the Upapisads, was from an attitude of blind acceptance to that of critical inquiry, from externalism to essentialism, from priestly exclusive ness to equality and freedom in the religio philosophical quest The Upanisadıc thinkers looked outwards' and inwards', and, through an analysis of the macrocosm and the microcosm, tried to discover the ultimate reality underlying them. They finally arrived at the grand concept that the ultimate reality underlying the apparent manifoldness in the world was one and permanent, whule the phenomenal world itself was merely a bundle of fleeting names and forms Through ignorance, man forgets his real nature, gets involved in the phenomenal world, and, as the result of the inexorable law of karman, continues to live through the transmigratory existences until he realises the identity of his true self with the ultimate reality and thereby becomes spiritually emancipated,
Though the teachings of the Upanisads have dominated Indian philosophical thought as a whole most profoundly, their immediate iniluence cannot be said to have been commensurate with their essentially radical character For one thing. on account of its peculiar mysticism, the philosophy of the Upa nişads could not be easily comprehended by people at large It, therefore, necessarily represented a way of life and thought intended only for the select few Again, the Upanisadıc thinkers succeeded to a certain extent in dislodging the earlier religions of the Samhitas and the Brābmanas, but they, as it were, left the people in the lurch by their failure to substitute any new religion of their own They apparently did not realise that people could live without a philosophy but that they could never live without a religion The gap thus created by the Upanisads in the religious life of the people was filled in, more than adequately, by such religious movements as Buddhism and Jainism This naturally mcant a serious set back to the old Brahmanism In order, there fore, to counteract this onslaught of the non-Brahmadic religions, the rear guards of the old Brahmanism started a comprehensive movement to consolidate, reorganise, and revitalise the BrahmiDIC

345
way of life and thought This revivalist movement in what might be called the Sutra Vedanga period touched all spheres of human life - religious, academic, domestic and social Indeed, it was then that, for the first time, conscious efforts were made to evolve a definite pattern of Brahmanic society This social aspect of Brahmanism is best represented in the Grhya Sutras and the Dharma Sutras and the later Smçtıs and other texts relating to the Dharma-sastra
One of the concepts which was elaborated and emphasised at this stage, in a special mapper, was that of dharma The word dharina has been used in most of the Brahmadic texts from the Rgveda downwards, and in different contexts, it has denoted different ideas, such as Vedic ritual, ethical conduct, caste rules, and civil and criminal law Actually, however, the concept of dharma is all comprehensive and may be, broadly speaking said to comprise precepts which aim at securing the material and the spiritual sustenance and growth of the individual and the society. Another significant characteristic of dharma, which deserves to be specially noted, is that it has always been regarded as sot being static The content of dharma has often changed in the changiog contexts of time, space, and environments
In spite of the essentially comprehensive character of dharma, in its most common connotation, it was limited to two principal ideals, namely, the organisation of social life through well defined and well regulated social orders (popularly known as varna dharma) and the organisation of an individuals life, within those social orders, through well coordinated stages ( = aśrama dharma) Thus, in popular parlance, dharma almost came to mean just varna-aśrama dharma
The varna vyavastha has, indeed, come to be regarded as the most essential feature of the Brahmanic society Even later Hinduism, which differs from Brahmanism in many significant respects, has scrupulously preserved this peculiar social organisa tion Though the word varpa vyavastha is generally translated as caste system, it should be remembered that, strictly speaking,
346
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
varna does not denote caste as we understand it today. Caste system is jāti-yyai asthā which no doubt represents a ramification of the original varna-vyavasthä or the system of social orders. From the early Brahmanic texts we can derive but little historical information regarding the origin and development of varnas and jātis. The aim of those texts was avowedly to glorify and defend the social organisation governed by the concepts of varnas and jātis. They, therefore, either speak of the divine origin of those social phenomena or give some mythical accounts in respect of them,
A complex social phenomenon such as the caste-system must, indeed, be presumed to be the result of the interaction of a variety of factors. The word varna (= colour, complexion) itself would indicate that one of these basic factors was racial distinction. In the Rgveda we actually come across references to the ārya-varna (= the Vedic Aryans) and the dāsa-varna (which is the name collectively given to all the racial groups other than and antagonistic to the Vedic Aryans). Another important factor was magico-ritualistic in character. The four main social orders were distinguished from one another on account of the specific roles which they were expected to play in connection with the communal sacrifice. These roles were determined by certain definite concepts of taboo, pollution, and purification, Corresponding to their roles in the ritual, these orders were assigned distinct colours, which fact also seems to have confirmed the use of the word varna with reference to them. This magico ritualistic origin of the four social orders is indirectly indicated by their mention in the Puruşa-sūkta (RV 8.90) as the limbs of the cosmic sacrificial Purusa. Then there was the impact on the social organisation of the Vedic Aryans of the pattern of social life which had been already evolved by the indigenous Indian communities; and this impact must have been responsible for the consolidation of yarna in the form of the social phenomenon which, in course of time, came to be designated as jäti or caste. In the initial stages, the varņas of social orders were more or less Quid and elastic. But, 10 course of time, they hardened into a
INDIAN PATTERN OF LIFE AND THOUGHT
347
rigid social system characterised by a large number of castes, sub castes, and mixed castes Elaborate discussions occur in the Dharma sastra texts regarding their respective duties and religious, social, and legal privileges and disabilities
Within these social orders (or castes ), an individual&rsquo;s life was organised into four distinct stages, called asramas, in such a manner that the individual should be enabled to realise, through a properly graded scheme, the four ends of life, namely, kama or aesthetic expression of natural instincts, artha or material prosperity, dharma or ethical conduct, and moksa or spiritual emancipation. These four stages of life are life of a student. life of a householder, life of a hermit or recluse, and life of an ascetic It will be seen that the aśrama dharma seeks to resolve the conflict between the two ideals, namely, the consolidation and the progress of the society on the one hand and the spiritual emancipation of the individual on the other In connection with the scheme of the aśramas, the Dharma sustra texts have stated clearly and at some length the Brahmanic ideals regarding such topics as education, position of woman, and family life Attempts have also been made to render the broad scheme of the aśramas more viable and effective by prescribing various samskaras or sacraments wbich are, as it were, the lamp posts on the road leading to the full fledged growth of man&rsquo;s personality These samskaras cover man s whole life - actually beginning from its prenatal and ending with its post-morteo phase
It will be thus seen that the Brabmanists had developed quite a remarkable social philosophy This philosophy continues to constitute - though in a more or less modified form - the basis of the Hindu society even up to this day The fact of its emergence would also serve as a corrective against the popular misconception that the ancient Indians always thought in terms of fatalism, pessimism, and otherworldliness

<p>A proper integration of the interests of the individual and the society may be said to constitutc the central problem of all social philosophy So far as the ancient Indian thinkers were concerned, they had developed in this field two distinct disciplines, namely Dharmaśāstra and Arthaśāstra. As a matter of fact, the ancient Indian concept of Dharma is very comprehensive and touches all aspects of man&rsquo;s relation with the society. One such aspect is political in character and often manifests itself in the form of the relation between the subject and the state. In view of the fact that the state in ancient India was mostly monarchical, this aspect of Dharma was known as Rajadharma ( duties of kings ). Naturally enough, the Rājadharma which, by and large, corres ponded with political theory and practice, formed but one of the many topics dealt with in the larger scheme of Dharmaśāstra. Dharmaśāstra was normally divided into three main sections, namely, ācāra or rules of conduct, vj&rsquo;avahāra or civil and criminal law, and prayascitta or expiation and punishment, and the Rājadharma was included in the section embodying the rules of conduct.
In course of time, however, polity came to be regarded as being important enough to be recognised as an independent branch of knowledge, under the same of Arthaśāstra. As against Dharmaśāstra, Arthaśāstra may be said to have given quite a new orientation to political theory and practice. It may be presumed that this new orientation was, at least to a certain extent, the result of the movement of popular Hinduism which, incidentally, arose, on the one hand, to counteract the essentially</p>

individualistic and renunciatory tendencies of the Upanisads and, on the other, to check the growth of the heterodox religions, Indeed, it is not impossible to find some indications of this new political ideology in the Mahābhārata itself. In order to overpower the Kaurava warriors, like Bhisma, Drona, and Karna, the Pandavas are seen to have often employed, under the advice and active direction of Kssna himself, such ruses and strategies as cannot be said to have been in strict accordance with the traditional rules of righteous war (dharma-yuddha). The ultimate victory of the Pandavas over the Kauravas symbolises, in a sense, the predominance of the new Arthaśāstra ideal over the older epic ideal of chivalry.
As for the essential difference between Dharmaśāstra and Arthaśāstra, it may be stated in broad and rather over-simplified terms, as follows: while Dharmaśāstra insisted on the righteous. Dess of both the means and the ends, Arthaśāstra concerned itself primarily with the attainment of the ends irrespective of the nature of the means employed for that purpose. It is not unlikely that one of the reasons why Arthaśāstra is traditionally believed to be a science ancillary to the Atharvareda is the similarity of their attitude in respect of the means and the ends, It would seem that the Arthaśāstra ideológy had completely dominated the polity of ancient India. Attempts were, however, made from time to time to reassert the superiority of Dharma Šāstra over Artbaśāstra by prescribing that, in the case of a conflict between the two, Dharmaśāstra should prevail.
Time was when it used to be argued that the genius of aacient ladia was so much preoccupied with metaphysical and theosophical matters that it had become intrinsically incapable of evolving any proper concepts in a secular science such as polity. Such a view, however, is now completely discounte panced. For. we know of several fields of activity in which the

ancient Indians have beautifully blended together the religious and the secular. Indeed, they took a fully integrated view of human existence, interests, and ideals, and evolved such concepts as those of the three debts (rna), the four cods of man (puru sārtha), and the four stages of an individual&rsquo;s life (aśrama), whereby they hoped effectively to coordinate the material with the spiritual and the personal with the social. As in the field of social thought, so too, in the field of political thought, the ancient Indians have made. ever since the early Vedic period, some very significant contributions. And these contributions, it must be added, were not always of the nature of mere description or rationalisation of a given state of political conditions. They often included the formulation, in a more or less scientific manner, of distinct theories of polity and principles of adminis tration. These political theories and administrative principles could not certainly have been mere idle speculations; they must have been vitally influenced by the various political forces and environments as much as they themselves must have, in their turn, influenced those forces and environments. It should also be remembered that they were generally of an indigenous origin, for most of them had been foșmulated at a time when there was no possibility of any foreign influence.
One thing, however, has to be conceded, namely, that systematic literature on the science of polity and the art of government began to be produced in ancient India only after the period of the early Upanisads Indeed, no systematic litera ture in any branch of knowledge can be said to date earlier than that period. But, though the early Vedic texts can by no means be characterised as embodying any organised thought in political science, they do afford not a few glimpses into the political ideology of the ancient Indians - glimpses which may be derived either directly from theoretical discussions or indirectly from mythological legends and references to contemporary political conditions. In the Atharva eda, for instance, there is a distinct category of hymns called Rājakarmāni which relate to matters pertaining to rulers. In one of such hymns we get a clear
ANCIENT INDIAN,POLITY
351
reference to the election of the king by the people (III. 4). Another hymn refers to the two popular assemblies, the sabha and the samiti (VII. 12).5
The Brāhmana texts contain still more numerous and varied references to political concepts and practices. For instance, there are found in them indications of kingship having arisen out of a state of nature (ŚPBr. XI, 1. 6. 24; I. 8. 1. 1-10) or as the result of the will of the Highest God (TBr. II. 2. 10. 1-2; 7,2) or as the upshot of election and social contract ( A Br. I. 14; VIII. 12). One of the Brålmana texts mentions several types of states known in that period (ABI. VIII. 12), while several others speak, in their descriptions, of the coronation ceremony and such matters as the king&rsquo;s position and prestige, his entourage, and the taxes which normally accrued to him (SPBr. V.3. 1; ABr. VIII. 10-12). The question of the relative position, from the political point of view, of the different social orders is also not infrequently mooted in the Vedic texts (RV IV. 50, 7; ABr. VII. 28-29; VIII. 4; TM Br. XI. 11. 1). Naturally enough the political concepts of the Samlitā- and the Brāhmana-periods were more or less directly related to the various forms of social and political organisation which obtained in that period, such as primitive communism, tribal democracies, small territorial states (mainly monarchical jo character &ndash; the monarchy, in some cases, being tinged with some sort of popular election), confederacies for political and military purposes, and suzerainty which one state sought to enforce on other states.
By their very nature the Upanişads cannot be regarded as constituting direct sources for the study of ancient Indian polity. But the various phases of the Weltanschauung of the Upanisads could not have failed to exert an appreciable influence on the formulation of the political thought in ancient India. There was another indirect way in which the Upanisads may be said to have helped the evolution of political thought in ancient India. The</li>

peculiar character of the teaching of the Upanisads engendered conditions which resulted in a temporary break in the continuity of the orthodox Brahmanic way of life and thought This interregnum produced by the Upani sads saw the growth of three significant thought movements which interacted upon one another Firstly, the heterodox systems of thought, like Buddhism, pushed themselves forward and sponsored a way of life and thought which was different from the orthodox Brahmanic way of life and thought Secondly, there was started, more or less as an antidote against heterodoxy, a great revivalist movement which aimed at reorganising, systematising, and consolidatiog the religious, social, and political thought and practices of orthodox Brahmanism And lastly, there was popular Hinduism, which took a strictly realistic and practical view of the religious, social, and political conditions of the period and formulated its general ideology in consonance with those conditions Each of these three ideological movements made, in its own way, some distinct contributions to the political thought of ancient India It was, for instance, the challenge with which Buddhism confronted ortho dox BrahmapSDthat was responsible for the emphasis which came to be put on the theory of social contract in connection with the origin and nature of kingshup Buddhism also seems to have introduced certain democratic concepts in Indian polity The revivalists, on the other hand, reorganised the ancient Brabmanic social and political philosophy and presented it in the form of the Dharmasūtras, spceial acecnt being given to Dharma as the guiding force of all activities in that field Iucidentally, it was these Dharmasutras which were later elabora ted in the form of Dharmaśāstra texts like the Manusmrti As suggested elsewhere, the popular Hinduism, which formally claimed allegiance to the Veda but which had actually assimilated into itself influences from various quarters and had consequently evolved quite a new ideology - an ideology which was often divergent from that of orthodox Brahmanism , must have helped the growth of political concepts and practices which eventually developed into Arthasastra as against Dharmasastra

The early Dharmasutras are mostly theoretical in character. They do not seem to have been specifically related to any particular set of social and political conditions. It is, therefore, possible to assume that, side by side with those Dharmasūtras, there had existed some kind of Arthasastra literature - presumably in the form of sūrras and more realistic in outlook - which served as a practical guide for the contemporary political dealings. That literature is now unfortunately not available - except perhaps in fragmeats - and is mainly known through references to it in later works. It was, however, a lucky chance that a remarkable book belonging to the second phase of the evolution of that literature - to the phase, that is to say, of thorough amplification of the older aphorisms - was discovered about fifty years ago. This was the well-known Arthasāstra attributed to Kautilya, the minister of Candragupta Maurya, who was a contemporary of Alexander the Great. This work is of exceptional interest and value, for, it has almost revolutionised the traditional view regarding certain aspects of ancient Indian history and culture.
The Arthasästra of Kautilya reflects, in a striking manner. the social and political forces which were at work in the early 4th century B. C. Alexander&rsquo;s incursions into India had helped to emphasise the need for establishing a central political and military power. The Arthasāstra has, accordingly, laid down policies in direct pursuance of the ideal of welding together, into a more or less unified pattern and under the control, direct or indirect, of a single authority, the variety and multiplicity of smaller states that crowded the stage of Indian history at that time. Interstatal relations thus constitute one of the main topics in Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthasāsira. Kautilya defines Arthaśāstra as the science which treats of the means of acquiring and maintaining the sovereignty of the earth. And it was but natural that a practical administrator like him should have occupied himself more fully with prescribing adequate ways and means for maintaining the earth, that is, for effectively administering the government of the dominion, than with mere theorising about the fundamental principles of political science.
45ANCIENT INDIAN POLITY

Dharma. In this spiritual venture of his he found solace in the teachings of the Buddha. Under Asoka&rsquo;s patronage Buddhism received great impetus and, consequently, it threw out a strong challenge to ancient Brahmanic traditions. The last Maurya monarch&rsquo;s commander-in-chief, Pușyamitra Sunga, who over threw his master and thereby established his own dynasty in Magadha, was a strong adherent of Brahmanism. Therefore, when he came to power he made a bold bid to resuscitate the Brahmanic way of life and thought. He performed the ašva medha sacrifice, actively promoted Sanskrit language and litera ture, and tried to re-establish the Brahmanic ideals in the social sphere.
It is out of this last activity that the Manusmrti has presum ably evolved. The Manusnirti represents perhaps the earliest attempt to amplify and consolidate the social ideology embodied in the ancient Dharmasītras. In the matter of political thought and art of government, however, it has not registered any significant advance.
The Mahābhārata which, in its fipal literary form, is more or less contemporaneous with the Manusmrti, is definitely richer in political speculations. The entire rajadharma section of the Šāntiparvan, for instance, constitutes a veritable compendium of political theories, rules of diplomacy, and details of adminis tration. But the main achievement of the Mahabharata consists in the synthesis of the older theories which it has attempted rather than in the enunciation of any new theories. And perhaps more significant than such theoretical discussions are the indi cations of political thought and practice which can be gleaned from the events actually described in the epic. At any rate, the total polity of the Sunga period may be said to have been ibe result of the attempts at blending together the political ideology of Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthasästra and the social ideology of the Manusmrti. Iadeed, this continued to be, by and large, the basic pattern of polity in the succeeding periods of ancient and medieval history of Igdia.
356
EXERCISES IN INDOLOGY
Among the later works in Sanskrit dealing with the subject of political science may be mentioned the Yajnaraikasmet (YS), the Kämandalija-Nitisara (KN), and the Sukrani (ŚN). The first of these words belongs to the category of Dharmaśāstra and the other two belong to that of Arthaśāstra. What Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthasāsira was in relation to the Maurya period and the Manusmrtı to the Sunga period, the YS may be said to have been in relation to the Gupta period. Though the YS, like the Manusmrti, does not male any original contribution to ancient Indian polity, it reflects, to a large extent, the social changes which had been brought about by the beginning of the Gupta epoch. Like the Manusmrti it also puts great emphasis on the rarnaśramadharma being the central theme of social theory; and when we take into account the vigorous co-mingling of foreign tribes, which characterised the preceding period, such an emphasis becomes quite understandable.
It would, however, seem that, in actual practice, the attitude of the Gupta rulers had been remarkably liberal and rational Nowhere is this better exemplified than in their administration of justice. The Gupta law-makers brought all persons, irrespecs tive of caste, property, and position in society, under the purvick of the king&rsquo;s supreme law. No person was regarded as being above the law. For instance, the YS denied to the Brāhman15 several legal concessions which they had previously enjo It also did anay with the many legal inequities from the Sūdras suffered. The law relating to women was considerably revised and brought in line with their changeu social status. The Gupta rulers were, however. shrewd enous to hasten slowly. In all matters of socio-legal reforms tried to strike the golden mean between the progressive terasu cies encouraged by the political and social conditions of the and the traditional orthodox conservatism. Attention may drawn to another significant feature of the Gupta lawy. earlier works on Dharmaśāstra presented a queer mx secular and religious law. The YS has clearly separated two aspects of law and has discussed yyavahāra or law proper

more systematically. It further lays greater stress upon private law than on criminal law.?
The KN, which also is traditionally ascribed to the Gupta period (circa 400 A.D.), is but a metrical conspectus of Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthaśāstra. Its author shows no originality whatsoever nor are any traces to be found in it of any practical experience of governmental administration on his part. The KN can thus be said to indicate, on the one hand, the unique sway which Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthasāstra held over ancient Indian polity and, on the other hand, the general fossilization of political thought in the succeeding periods.
Incidentally a reference may be made in this very context to the Kural, a comprehensive work in Tamil by Tiruvalluvar, which deals with three out of the four ends of man (puruşārthas ), namely, dharma (religion and ethics ), artha (material progress and prosperity), and kāma (aesthetic pleasure). This work probably belongs to 450-500 A. D, and, like most of the Tamil literature produced in that epoch, shows unmistakable influence of earlier Sanskrit works. Even a casual perusal of the section on polity in the Kural would make it quite evident that Tiruva lluvar was closely acquainted with Kautilya&rsquo;s Arthašāstra and had derived his inspiration and material from that work. Contrary to our expectations, therefore, the Kural does not contain any political thought which can be characterised as peculiar to South India.
The last phase of the history of ancient Indian polity is represented by the ŚN, which is usually ascribed to about 800 A. D. This work also is of the nature of a conspectus of the earlier works on Arthaśāstra, but it is remarkable for its</li>

detailed treatment of administrative machinery, foreign relations, and military policy.
Apart from such works dealing with Dharmaśāstra and Arthaśāstra, attention may be drawn to certain other sources for the study of ancient Indian polity. Useful information about the political theory and practice in ancient India can be gleaned from the accounts of foreign travellers who visited India at different times. Then there are the large number of inscriptions belonging to the various historical periods. These epigraphic records do not, of course, contain any theoretical discussions on the subject, but they throw considerable light on the various aspects of the revenue, military, and judicial administration, the social and economic conditions, and the central and local govern mental machinery in those respective periods. And this is, indeed, what we need for a proper estimate of ancient Indian polity. For, after all, does ancient Indian polity not concero itself more with the practical problems of goveroment and administration than with an academic discussion of political theories ?
