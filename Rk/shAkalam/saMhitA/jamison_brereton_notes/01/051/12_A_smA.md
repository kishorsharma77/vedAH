Another verse with tricky constructions. In the first pāda the loc. vṛṣapā́ṇesu goes misleadingly easily into English (“you mount the chariot to…” like “the bus to town”). Despite my tr. I think it more likely that vṛṣapā́ṇesu is functionally a loc. absolute of the type “when bullish drinks (are available)” à “on the occasion of bullish drinks / when there are bullish drinks.” In pāda b most tr. (Gr, Ge, Re, WG) take prábhṛtā as representing -āḥ out of sandhi - following the Pp., hence a nom. pl. m. past participle - but as Old points out, this is very disruptive to the syntax. Better, with Old, to interpret it as a loc. sg. to the

-i-stem prábhṛti- ‘presentation’, a possibility suggested by Pischel (see Old) and
mentioned by Ge in his n.

Pāda c is standardly taken as preposed to d and the verb is tr. as indicative (e.g., Ge “du … deine Freude hast,” Re “tu prends plaisir”), but cākánaḥ is undeniably subjunctive; yáthā + subjunctive regularly builds purpose clauses, which are regularly postposed. I therefore take pāda c with ab: the purpose of Indra’s mounting of the chariot is the pleasure he will receive at the soma sacrifice.

In d all tr. take ślókam as ‘fame’, but the noun refers rather to a very perceptible noise or call that signals some event. The event is often the sacrifice and the ślóka-, the noise, is often issued by the pressing stones (e.g., I.113.3, 139.10, III.53.10); the noise of the ślóka- is loud enough to reach to heaven (e.g., I.83.6, 190.4). This pāda contains this same notion of the ślóka-, the audible signal of the sacrifice, going to heaven, but it seems also, oddly, to suggest that Indra follows it there. Perhaps this refers to Indra’s departure to heaven at the end of the sacrifice, a common theme.
