In pāda c the preverbs abhy ā́are oddly positioned, after the caesura, and, more important, the two apparent acc. objects śátrūn ‘rivals’ and bhandanāyátaḥ ‘those seeking blessings’ are antithetical, with only the first an appropriate obj. to jahí. The problems disappear if, with Ge, we supply a second verb to go with the preverbs and to govern the 2nd acc. A verb of motion fits well, and √i, √gam, and √yā all appear with this combination of preverbs, whereas √han does not. Ge goes for slightly richer semantics: “(komm) … zu (Hilfe)” - without specifying what verb he supplies, but note that √av does not appear with those preverbs.

The identities of Soma and Indra appear to bleed into each other in the course of the vs. In ab the 2nd ps. subject is clearly Soma, on the basis of voc. pavamāna (a) and priyó mádaḥ (b). The assumption then is that the impv. jahí in c is also addressed to Soma. But in d we get direct address of Indra and at the end of the pāda he is the subj. of a second jahi. Therefore pāda c, which contains no lexical clue to the addressee, could be addressed either to Soma or to Indra (or both).
