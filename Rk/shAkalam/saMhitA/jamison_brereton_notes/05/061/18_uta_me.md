The Rathavīti phrase is in the loc.; the publ. tr. renders it as if the addressee, which is technically incorrect. It is either a loc. absol. without participle or a “chez/bei” expression: “speak for me thus when R. (is present) / at R’s.” Since the net result is the same, I have kept the easier-to-parse addressee tr.
