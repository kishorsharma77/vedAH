Dawn As noted in the publ. intro., ví is the signature word of this hymn. The first and last hemistichs of the hymn (1a, 5c) begin with ví and a form (indeed two, in the etymological figure in 1a) of √vas: 1a vy uṣā̀āvaḥ and 5c vyuchántī, forming a ring, and ví opens 1d, 2a, 3c, 4d as well. This preverb also gets played with in various ways: 2b opens with víśo ‘clans’, whose 1st syllable falsely promises the preverb. The regular oppositional counterpart of ví, namely sám, opens 2c and provides the 2nd syllable of 1c (susaṃdṛ́gbhiḥ). The alliteration of 3c is also set in motion by its opening ví (see below).
