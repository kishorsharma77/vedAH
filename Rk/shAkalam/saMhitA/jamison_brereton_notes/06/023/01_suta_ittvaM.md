The rendering of nímiśla- as ‘intertwined’ may be a bit over the top, but ‘attached to’ or ‘linked to’ is too anodyne; assuming an underlying sense ‘mixed’, the point is that Indra can’t be separated from the substances and words offered to him in the ritual.

The standard NP suté sóme is polarized at the boundaries of pāda a, allowing sóme to directly adjoin its rhyme form (and ritual partner) stóme over the pāda boundary -- a simple but effective use of word order.
