The gender politics of this vs. would not bear modern scrutiny: the idea seems to be that the Earth enjoys rough sex because she gets nice presents. But it is a powerful image.

The poss. adj. mīḷhúṣmant- occurs twice in the RV; the other form is found in VI.50.12, where it is masc. and seems barely distinct from mīḷhvás- ‘giving rewards, generous’. Here in this fem. form the possessive value of -mant- does have force, assuming the correctness of Ge’s and Re’s interpr. as ‘possessing a generous (man/lord/spouse)’. WG take it rather as ‘Soldatenbraut’, interpr. mīḷhvás- as ‘one who has mīḷhá-’ (booty, etc) and further suggesting that the woman in question was part of the spoils of war. This is appealing in some ways, but it does not fit well with the last word of the hymn, mīḷhuṣī́.

As Ge points out (n. 3a), párāhatā may have two senses -- simply ‘beaten aside’ by the onslaught of the Maruts and ‘(sexually) penetrated’, for which sense he cites ŚB XI.5.1.1 vaitaséna daṇḍéna hatāt [sic, not Ge’s hatā], the ŚB paraphrase of Urvaśī’s … mā … śnathayo vaitaséna (X.95.5) “you pierced me with your rod.”
