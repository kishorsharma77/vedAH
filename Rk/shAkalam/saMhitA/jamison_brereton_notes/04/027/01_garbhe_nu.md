The major problem with this vs. is pāda d, with a nom. śyenáḥ and the 1st sg.

nír adīyam. At first glance this seems to require that the speaker be the falcon, not Soma. The problem, and various previous suggested solutions, are discussed at length by Old. He rejects an emendation to 3rd ps. *adīyat (rightly in my view) and suggests instead that we must indeed take the speaker to be the falcon. In this he is followed by Ge (/WG). However, this makes problems with pāda c (“a hundred metal fortifications guarded me”), where the 1st ps. speaker should surely be Soma, whose release from captivity in heaven is the subject of the hymn, not the falcon, who flies freely around. Moreover, it seems unlikely that we would care about the long-standing knowledge that the falcon has (ab), whereas again Soma’s knowledge is relevant. A somewhat ad hoc, but still satisfying (to me anyway) solution was suggested by Thieme (Gedichte, 41), who takes ádha śyenáḥ as an abrupt nominal clause -- “Then the falcon!” -- expressing the surprise advent of the bird in Soma’s place of captivity. The 1st sg. verb can then have Soma, the speaker, as its subject.
