Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The emphasis in this hymn, as often in Indra hymns, is on Indra’s victories and the  gains he won not only for himself but also for gods and mortals. In several verses  (esp. 3 and 6) Indra’s sheer power, reinforced by his backup troops, is contrasted  with his control of clever tricks and artifice; both types of approach contribute to  his success.
The underlying theme of victory, expressed in a variety of ways earlier in the  hymn, becomes insistent in the numerous repetitions of the verb “win” (√san) in the  last three verses before the refrain (vss. 8–10), which contain eight forms of the verb  (including four forms of the perfect sasā́na in a single verse [9]); the root appears  previously in the hymn only in the root noun compound svar-sán “winning the sun”  in verse 4.
The poets’ role in spurring Indra to victory is mentioned several times at the  beginning of the hymn (vss. 1–2), but is otherwise backgrounded; the poets’ task in  the hymn is more to celebrate and praise (vss. 6, 7, 8) the god than to inspire him. In  fact, it is Indra who grants inspiration to the poets (vs. 5), an action that precedes  and makes possible their praises in verses 6–8.
One curious feature of the hymn is the presence of phraseology and imagery  characteristic of the god Agni in 3cd and of fire-priests in 4ab. The point of contact  is probably to be found in verse 4, where Indra is said to win the sun and make it  shine, and to find the light, since the kindling of the ritual fire at dawn is associated  with and often presented as the cause of the sunrise.
