In d JPB takes paurá as pauré out of sandhi, as a PN. In VIII.61.6 I take it as ‘multiplier’ (of Indra) in a pun with purukṛ́t-. In VIII.50.5 a clear loc. shows the sense that JPB wants. In V.74.4 there are three exx., one apparently a PN, the other also apparently a pun on puru- (JPB tr. ‘muchness’). I’d be inclined here to take it in non-PN name fashion, either as loc. “in its muchness” or modifying soma: “soma multiplied” (to puru) or perhaps more likely, given pṛṇántaḥ in c, ‘filling’ or ‘in its fullness’.
