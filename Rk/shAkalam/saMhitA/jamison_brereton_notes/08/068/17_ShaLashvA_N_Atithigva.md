vadhúmant- means literally ‘having women, brides’, but Ge raises the question whether in this context it really refers to mares. I think this unlikely.

Dānastutis regularly lump horses and female humans together. Very parallel is I.126.3 śyāvāḥ ... vadhū́mantaḥ ... ráthāsaḥ, “dusky (horses) and chariots carrying brides.”
