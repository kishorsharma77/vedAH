Indra  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
9 verses: gāyatrī  
An elementary hymn, focused entirely on the ritual and on Indra’s journey to it and  participation in it. In this it is reminiscent of III.35, though in a different meter, and  

like that hymn this one entirely lacks praise of the god, reference to his past deeds,  and prayers for his gifts and aid.
