As in the immediately preceding hymn III.32.9-10, the poet here seems to be trying to express verbal nuances that are not coded systematically in the Vedic verbal system, in particular another variety of anteriority. Here the sequence of moods is unusual: pres. optative in the subord. cl. (saṃtáreyuḥ), pres. subjunctive in the main cl. (árṣāt). With the optative he seems to be aiming at a future perfect (“will/would have crossed”) whose prospective action precedes that of the main verb, namely the subjunctive referring to future time. Although I have not examined the entire RV with this in mind, these experiments in anteriority seem confined to -- or at least especially pronounced in -- the work of this poet. Note also that the poet makes no attempt to generate an opt. to the pf. tatāra or to use the already existing pf. opt.

tuturyā́- (RV 5x). This provides further evidence, if more were needed, against Dahl’s claim that the pf. opt. denotes “epistemic possibility and anterior aspect” (Time, Tense and Aspect, p. 402 and in general pp. 392-402). If this were a stable function of the pf. opt., surely Viśvāmitra would have availed himself of that formation.

The vs. reprises much of the vocabulary from earlier in the hymn: iṣitá índrajūtaḥ is an elaboration on índreṣita- in 2a; the oft-repeated prasavá- returns again in the expression prasaváḥ sárgataktaḥ repeated from 4c.
