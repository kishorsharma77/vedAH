Soma Pavamāna
Kaśyapa Mārīca
4 verses: paṅkti
This final hymn in the Soma Maṇḍala has the feeling of an afterthought. The seer  addresses himself in verse 2, and the fortunate ritualist depicted in verse 1 is most  likely Kaśyapa as well. In verse 3 he produces a triad of heptads, which have little to  do with his call to Soma to protect us (3d). The final verse (4) repeats this call and  enlarges on the dangers we wish to avoid.
## 1
The one who has stridden along the domains of the self-purifying drop, of him they say “(he will) have good offspring”—the one who has
dedicated his thought to you, Soma.
– O drop, flow around for Indra.
## 2
O seer Kaśyapa, strengthening up your songs with the praises of the  mantra-makers,
do homage to Soma the king, who was born as the lord of plants.
– O drop, flow around for Indra.
## 3
Seven are the quarters, each with its separate sun; seven are the Hotars  sacrificing in due order.
The Āditya gods, who are seven—with them, o Soma, protect us.
– O drop, flow around for Indra.
## 4
The oblation that is readied for you, o king—with that, o Soma,
protect us.
Let no hostile man overcome us, and let nothing whatsoever afflict us. – O drop, flow around for Indra.
