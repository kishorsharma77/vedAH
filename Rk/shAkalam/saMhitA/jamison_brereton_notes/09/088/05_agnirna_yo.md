Because the finite verb kṛṇute in b is unaccented, the rel. cl. must be confined to pāda a, and this in turn means that sṛjyámānaḥ is a predicated pres.

participle. On the phrase in pāda b, see comm. ad IX.76.1.

The loc. váne must be read twice, in both simile and frame, with different senses. Just as Agni/fire is set loose in the firewood, Soma is set loose in the wooden cup.
