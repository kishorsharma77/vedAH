As noted ad VI.54.8 above, this vs. contains a more complex variant of ī́śānaṃ rāyá īmahe in VI.54.8c. There I interpr. rāyáḥ as both a gen. sg. with ī́śānam and an acc. pl. with īmahe. In our vs. here, ī́śānam is found in pāda b with an undoubted gen. phrase rā́dhaso maháḥ, while in pāda c rāyó sákhāyam īmahe we again find a rāyáḥ that is both gen. sg. (with sákhāyam) and acc. pl. (again with īmahe). This complex seems like a partial “repair” of 54.8, since it makes clear that ī́śānam takes the gen., which in turn suggests that rāyáḥ in 54.8 may have that reading too.
