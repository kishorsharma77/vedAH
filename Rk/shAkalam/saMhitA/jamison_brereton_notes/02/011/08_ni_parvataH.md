After the three augmented aorists in the previous vs. and with akrān in pāda b, the injunctive sādi in pāda a is a little surprising, esp. since this pāda seems to describe the same action as 7d. I wonder whether the poet is playing a trick: the negated participle áprayuchan almost seems to have the augment we expect in *asādi but transposed to the next word (and of course etymologically and functionally quite distinct). Note that áprayuchan occupies the same metrical position as áprathiṣṭa in 7c (the immediately preceding hemistich) and shares the same first two syllables.

The s-aor. akrāṇ in b should be tr. “has roared” to match the other augmented aorists in the immediate context.

The lexeme ní √prath occurs only here in the RV and, at least according to Mon.-Wms., in all of Sanskrit. This isolation makes it all the more difficult to figure out what is going on in pāda d, since the reference of the almost equally isolated dhamáni- is unclear. Note the placement of the preverb ní after the verb paprathan at the end of the verse, an almost mirror image of the opening of the vs. ní párvataḥ.

This vs.-final paprathan ní is also echoed by the end of the 1st hemistich in the next vs. asphuran níḥ. Both verbs precede their preverbs, but despite having apparently identical endings, -an, the first is a real 3rd pl. -an, where asphuran represents 3rd sg. asphurat in sandhi.
