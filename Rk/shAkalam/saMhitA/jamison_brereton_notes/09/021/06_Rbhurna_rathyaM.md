The adj. ráthya- generally modifies either chariot horses or chariot wheels; here, with the presence of a craftsman, the latter is most likely. So also Gr, Ge, and Re.

As was just noted, pāda b dádhātā kétam ādíśe is almost identical to 5b dádhātā venám ādíśe. Nonetheless, Ge and Re unaccountably (at least to me) take the VP entirely differently here from 5b: they take návaṃ, dádhātā as a phrasal verb “renew, make new,” with ādíśe filling a different syntactic role. E.g., “Erneuet, um (ihn) zu mahnen, seinen Vorsatz …” (Sim. Keydana, Inf., 318, who shows no awareness of the parallel in the immed.

preceding vs.) First, I know of no other exx. of náva- √dhā in the sense ‘make new’, a sense expressed rather by náva- √kṛ (e.g., X.143.1). But, more important, the close parallelism between 5b and 6b strongly suggests that they should be interpr. the same way, with the acc. the subj. of the infinitive.

By the Ge/Re (/Keydana) interpr., in the simile the craftsman is “renewing” the wheel; by mine, he is “setting/placing” it on the chariot, with a slightly different sense of √dhā than in the frame.
