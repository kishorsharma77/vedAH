sudákṣiṇa- is a triple pun. In its only other RVic occurrence (VIII.33.5) it means ‘having a good right (horse)’, but it could equally mean ‘having a good right (hand)’, alluding to the immediately preceding vájrahasta- ‘having the mace in his hand’. And, in keeping with the theme of giving, it can refer to the dákṣiṇā-, the priestly gift’ distributed at the dawn sacrifice. This would respond to the rāyáskāma- ‘desirous of wealth’, which opens the verse.
