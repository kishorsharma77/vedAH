The root affiliation of sám … varanta is disputed. Most take it as belonging to √vṛ ‘choose’ (Ge, Re [apparently, see below], WG); I follow Gr and Lub in assigning it to √vṛ ‘cover’. Although it is difficult to judge, there are more clear root aor. subjunctive middle forms to ‘cover’ than to ‘choose’ (though cf. I.140.13 where varanta does belong to ‘choose’ and takes íṣam as object). Moreover, sám does not appear to be found with ‘choose’, but is at least marginally attested with ‘cover’ (cf. VIII.17.7 and X.16.7).

The other question about this verb is what is its subject. Ge takes íṣaḥ as the acc. pl. obj. and supplies the singers or rich patrons as subj. (sim. WG): “Sie bitten sich alle Genüsse (als Lohn) aus.” Inserting a 3rd ps. subject is a bit awkward in a verse in which the human petitioners are otherwise in the 1st ps. (a asmát, c naḥ, d syāma). Re takes íṣaḥ as the subject, in one of his finer sleights of hand: “Puissent les jouissances-rituelles affluer (-comme-par-choix!),” where the supposed root verb appears only in the parenthesis and the Sanskrit justification for “affluer” is entirely unclear. I take íṣaḥ as the subject, with ‘us’ supplied as object: “completely cover (us)” expresses the abundance of refreshments Indra will provide.
