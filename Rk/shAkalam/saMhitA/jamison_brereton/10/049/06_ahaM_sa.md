I am the one who (aided?) Navavāstva of the lofty chariots—I, the smasher  of Vr̥tra [/obstacles], shattered the Dāsa like obstacles [/Vr̥tras]—  
when he [=Navavāstva] was causing (me) to grow strong and spread  
out according to due ritual order. I made the realms of light on the  
distant far shore of airy space.
