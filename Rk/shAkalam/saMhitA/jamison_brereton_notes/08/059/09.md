I am a little uncertain why/how Agni protects us with hymn(s) (gír-), which are what we usually offer to him. Ge and Re soften the expression by tr.

‘word(s)’, but that is not what gír- means. Perhaps Agni’s “hymns” are the crackling noises of the fire, or else the instrumentals express cause: “protect us by reason of (our) hymns.” I prefer the former of these solutions. (See 18a below.) The various instrumentals cannot directly take up the pāyúbhiḥ of 8d, because pāyú- is masc. and all four number instrumentals (ékayā, etc.) are unambiguously feminine, as is gírwhen it finally shows up in c.
