The subject must change between pādas a and b, since the subj. of a is fem.

and b contains a masc. nom. sg. (urāṇáḥ). I supply Agni as the subj. of b, as he clearly is of the repeated pāda III.19.2c. So also Old (SBE); others are less explicit.

The standard tr. take urāṇáḥ as transitive, with devátātim as obj. (e.g., Ge “die Götterschar sich erwählend”) (also in the identical pāda III.19.2c). But in all clear cases urāṇá- is passive (as opposed to trans. vṛṇāná-), and it seems esp. unlikely that the occurrence here would be transitive when the next vs. (4d) contains the same form in the same metrical position (verse-final) in clear passive usage (cf. also the next hymn IV.7.8c). Moreover it is not entirely clear to me what “choosing” the divine assembly would mean, whereas Agni’s being chosen as a priest is a standard trope. The occurrences of devátāti- in vss. 1b and 9d show that the divine assemblage was present at the ritual and that Agni was acting on their behalf. Taking urāṇáḥ as the passive it ordinarily is leaves the acc. devátātim ungoverned grammatically, but in the publ. tr. I construe it loosely with pradakṣiṇít. It is possible that it could instead be loosely construed with urāṇáḥ “being chosen as priest for the divine assemblage”).

On akrá- see comm. ad I.189.7.

It may seem odd that the wooden post “anoints” the sacrificial animal tied to it, and in fact WG dissociate pādas c and d and make Agni the subject of d. But this striking turn of phrase can be explained both as a metaphor and by the principle of ritual transfer. Metaphorically “anoint” can simply mean “make ritually fit for sacrifice,” and this may be in play here: tying the animal to the post is a regular step in the animal sacrifice. But more interesting is the ritual transfer. In the one hymn in the RV devoted to the post (III.8), the post itself is anointed by the priests (III.8.1a añjánti tvā́m … vánaspate), and later in that hymn the mechanism for that anointing is made clear: the offering ladles have been stretched over the posts (III.8.7b yatásrucaḥ). Thus the posts dripping with ghee presumably transfer the ghee to the attached animals, anointing them in their turn. Note that in our vs. the first pāda concerns the outstretched ghee-filled ladle (yatā́… ghṛtā́cī), and we can assume that the same ritual sequence obtains here: ladle anoints post, which anoints animals.
