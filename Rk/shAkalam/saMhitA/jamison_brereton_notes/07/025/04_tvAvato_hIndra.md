The prohibitive clause ná mardhīḥ is of course grammatically incorrect.

We expect mā́with the injunctive in prohibitives, and in fact find it with this same stem several times: mā́no mardhīḥ IV.20.10, mā́no mardhiṣṭam VII.73.4, 74.3, 29 always with the 1st pl. enclitic following the mā́. Non-prohibitive forms of √mṛdh almost always occur with the negative ná, e.g., ná mardhanti (I.166.2, III.54.14); there are no positive attestations of this verb. Our passage must be an odd conflation of the prohibitive passages with enclitic no and the non-prohibitive passages with negative ná. Or alternatively, and in my opinion less likely, this is a non-prohibitive use of the injunctive: “you do/did not neglect.” That, however, is Hoffmann’s solution (Injunk., 101), taking it “als allgemeine Eigenschaft” of Indra’s: “du lässt nicht im Stich.” See his discussion, where he also points out that that *mā́mardhīḥ would be metrically bad.
