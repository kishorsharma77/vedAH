I am not entirely certain of the force of ádhi: my ‘over’ does not parse very well in Engl. tr. But the point is probably that the verbal part of the ritual, embodied by the fem.

dhītí- ‘insightful thought/speech’ and therefore conceived of as female, is produced at the same time as the “semen” of Soma, namely the juice itself. This semen is attributed both to a bull, Soma as hypervirile adult male animal, and, if we supply rétasi in c for the genitives to depend on (so also Ge and Re), to a calf, presumably not yet sexually mature, who is further the son of these mothers (the words, at least by my interpr.). Ge (n. 4) calls the verse “ein Paradoxon,” though he doesn’t bother to explain what he thinks the paradox is. I assume that it is the identification of Soma as both bull and calf.

I further assume that the “mothers” (mātáraḥ) of c are co-referential with the dhītáyaḥ of a, though it might be possible to separate them -- with the mothers being the milk-mixture or some other ritual substance. Lü (247) considers the mothers distinct from the dhītáyaḥ and referring to the heavenly streams, but this is a predictable result of his idée fixe.
