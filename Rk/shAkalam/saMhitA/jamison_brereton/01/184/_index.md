Aśvins
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
This last hymn in Agastya’s series to the Aśvins is a symmetrically shaped five-verse  composition, since the final verse (6) is simply repeated from the previous hymn  (183.6). The first two verses call the gods to the sacrifice and urge them to enjoy the  sacrifice and be attentive to the poet. Verses 4–5 return to the scene of the sacrifice,  requesting that the gifts and attention of the Aśvins be directed to us, not to others  (vs. 4), while verse 5 contains a common type of summary of the hymn in which it’s  found, announcing its completion (5ab), and ends with the Aśvins in the company  of Agastya (5d). The poet’s positioning of his own name directly adjacent to that  of the Aśvins (voc. Nāsatya) in the final pāda of this series was surely deliberate.
The middle verse (3) makes a brief detour into mythology: the participation of  the Aśvins in the bridal journey of Sūryā, Daughter of the Sun (5ab). The verse  is addressed, in the first instance, to Pūṣan, who also participates in this episode  elsewhere. Several obscure images are found in this verse—the simile comparing  the Aśvins to arrow-makers (3a) and the journey of their lead horses (3cd) with the  well-nigh-impenetrable simile involving “vast Varuṇa,” which may refer to the sea  and reflect the generally later association of Varuṇa with waters. These difficulties  are, of course, appropriate to a structurally isolated middle verse.
