The ‘gift’ (rātí-) in b is the ladle containing the ghee. Re points to passages (III.19.2, IV.6.3) where the ladle is described as rātín- ‘possessing/providing gifts’.

In d Ge takes áyukta as passive, with the Hotar as subj. and nā́satyā as the obj.

of a loc. inf. hávīman: “der eingespant is, die Ns zu laden.” The pass. interpr. is explicitly rejected by both Old and Re, in favor of a rendering like mine. Although Ge’s interpr. is appealing in certain ways, there are several things against it: 1) the well-attested mid. root aor. of √yuj is almost always transitive (pass. áyukta in V.17.3, I.48.7) -- there is after all a distinct passive aor. áyoji, áyujran to express this function; 2) I know of no instances (nor does Old) in which loc. hávīman(i) functions as an infin. and takes an object.
