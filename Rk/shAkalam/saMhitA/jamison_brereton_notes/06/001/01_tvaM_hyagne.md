As noted ad loc., the first hymn of Maṇḍala IV begins identically (IV.1.1.a): tváṃ hí agne, with the same puzzling use of ordinarily causal hí in the first pāda of a hymn. It might be possible here to tr. the first hemistich as a causal clause subordinate to cd: “Because … you became the first minder of this insightful thought and the Hotar, you made …” On the stem manótar- see comm. ad II.9.4 and IV.1.16, 5.10. Note also that the HvN pausal resolution of the word as manóta is faulty; it should end in a long -ā.

Ge construes the gen. asyā́dhiyáḥ with both manótā and hótā, but the latter doesn’t usually govern a genitive.

The sīm in c presumably refers to the dhī́- of b. The publ. tr. could be slightly altered to “made it into power …”; so Ge “… machtest es zu … Macht.” On the infinitival construction in cd, see also Keydana (253). Note the attraction of the object of sáhadhyai into the dative case (víśvasmai sáhase). Pāda d is also noteworthy in having three forms of √sah, though two belong to the same s-stem.
