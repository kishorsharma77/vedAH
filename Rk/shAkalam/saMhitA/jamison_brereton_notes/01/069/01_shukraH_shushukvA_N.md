The etymological figure śukráḥ śuśukvā́n is not as redundant as it seems, because both forms are found in similes with the sun — svàr ṇá śukrám (II.2.7, IV.45.2) with the adjective and svàr ṇá śuśucīta (II.2.10, X.43.9) with the perfect — both are found together in X.43.9 svàr ṇá śukráṃ śuśucīta. In other words, since the similes "like the lover of Dawn" and “like the light of heaven” have the sun as their underlying referent, at least one of the √śuc forms is, as it were, bound to it formulaically.
