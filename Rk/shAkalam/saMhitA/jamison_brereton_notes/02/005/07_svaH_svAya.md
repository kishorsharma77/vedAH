The convoluted but rhetorically balanced expression sváḥ svā́ya dhā́yase kṛṇutā́m ṛtvíg ṛtvíjam (“Let him, as Rtvij, ̥ make himself R̥tvij, to suckle himself”) makes explicit Agni’s double role in this hymn: he is both a divine version of each priest in turn and represents the corresponding human priest. Here as divine Ṛtvij he makes himself into the human Ṛtvij, whose function is to give nourishment to the ritual fire, that is, to himself -- a kind of closed and reflexive circle. Once the mechanism of the identifications that have run through the hymn has been laid bare, the poet briskly finishes up the hymn, beginning with the summary 2nd hemistich here.

Most tr. struggle to construe stómaṃ yajñáṃ ca with the closest verb, vanéma.

Somewhat against my principles, I instead take ā́d áraṃ, vanéma as parenthetical and construe the first NP with rarimā́. (I have displaced the tr. of the ā́d clause to the right, because the parenthetical tr. was difficult to parse.) In favor of this interpr. is the fact that the standard tr. require ā́d to be in a highly unusual position, in the middle of its supposed clause. As it happens, WG interpr. the syntax as I do.
