This vs. is quite straightforward until we reach pāda d, where the nom. ahám ‘I’ demands a verb that isn’t there. Keeping in mind the theme of divine/human reciprocity that runs through the last hymn and the rest of this one and employing our usual method of attempting to supply missing material from context, it seems best to supply a form of práti √grabh complementary to práti … jagṛbhyāt in a with Aditi as subject. The poet wishes to grasp the bráhman- produced by the gods (c) in order to turn it into praise (stóma-) for the gods (a). This reciprocal relationship may be signaled by the first word in the vs. práti ‘in return, in response’.

The other question in d is what to do with the untethered locc. mitré varuṇé. I have followed Ge in loosely construing them with mayobhú ‘joy itself’, even though this stem does not elsewhere take a loc. Ge (n. 2d) cites a series of parallels with locc.

mitré váruṇe that seem to have similarly loose beneficial value.
