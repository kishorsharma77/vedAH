As was just noted, the Paṇis (niggards) may be indirectly implicated in the verb avamīt in 2d. Here they appear overtly, as the hiders of ghee -- presumably a reference to their stealing of the cows, since the gods find the ghee in the cow in pāda b.

The threefold nature and creation of ghee has been variously interpreted; it again participates in the numerology of the hymn. I do not have a view on it.
