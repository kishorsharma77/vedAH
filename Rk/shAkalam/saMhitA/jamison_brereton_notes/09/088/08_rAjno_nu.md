This vs. is identical to I.91.3, also a Soma hymn. Unfortunately the publ. tr.

of the two vss. differ in pāda b. In I.91.3 I tr. “lofty and deep is your domain.” I now think this should be harmonized with the tr. here “yours is his lofty, deep domain.” The vs. attributes to Soma some of the salient characteristics of the three principal Ādityas overtly in a, c, d, and it seems unlikely that one pāda would deviate from this pattern. Both Varuṇa (I.123.8, IV.5.4) and (more often) Varuṇa + Mitra (I.152.4-5, VII.61.4, X.10.6, X.89.8) possess dhā́man-. Here Soma’s dhā́man- can be identified with that of just-mentioned Varuṇa (so the publ. tr.) or anticipate Mitra (pāda c) in addition to Varuṇa.
