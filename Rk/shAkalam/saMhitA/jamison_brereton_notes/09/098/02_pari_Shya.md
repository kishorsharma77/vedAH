On the instr. drúṇā and the phrase drúṇā hitá- see comm. ad IX.1.2. One of the problems with the standard interpr. of this phrase, that it refers to the wooden cup into which the Soma is poured, is that it would be out of sequence, since the vs. otherwise describes the early part of Soma’s journey across the ritual ground.

The pāda-final avyáyam (a) and avyata (b) echo each other.

The actual target of the simile in b, the nominative equivalent of Soma in the frame, is gapped, being represented only by the adjuncts ráthe and várma: “like (a man/warrior) on a chariot his armor.” In the publ. tr. “a man” should be in parens.
