The dat. índrāya opening pāda b echoes the dat. indriyā́ya, which closes the preceding vs. (6d). It is also piquant that Soma adopts “Vṛtra-slayer” (vṛtrahán-), Indra’s own epithet, when he acts on behalf of Indra.

The two aims of Soma’s purification abhí devávītim and índrāya “towards pursuit of the gods” and “for Indra” are grammatically non-parallel.
