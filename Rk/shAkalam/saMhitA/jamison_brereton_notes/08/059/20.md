The voc. āghṛṇīvaso is taken lit. by Ge and Re (‘Glutreicher’ and ‘riche en ardeur-de-feu’ respectively). But ā́ghr̥ṇi- is an epithet exclusively of Pūṣan, and it is highly unlikely that it would be used only here, in this awkward compound, without that reference. So it must mean ‘who has the goods of Pūṣan’ -- presumably the cows and other domestic stuff that are appropriate to this last pragātha.
