On the syntax of pāda a, see comm. on 1c.

Against the Pp (and all standard tr., as well as Krick) I take the sandhi form ávara as standing for loc. sg. ávare, not nom. sg. ávaraḥ. Although ávara- is a pronominal adjective, and several instances of ávare are nom. pl., there are also several that are undeniably loc. sg. (II.9.3, 24.11). Taking it as a nom. sg. requires attributing lesser powers to Indra, which strikes me as pragmatically unlikely (cf., e.g., Old “geringer (an Schnelle) war Indra”). My interpretation identifies the horse/sun-bird with Indra and situates him in a lower realm (the midspace, presumably).
