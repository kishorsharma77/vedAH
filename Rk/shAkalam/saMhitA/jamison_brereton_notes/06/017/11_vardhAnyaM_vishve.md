For Agni as the subj. of pácat and cooker of the buffaloes, see V.29.7-8 adduced by Ge and Old, ZDMG 55.321.

In the 2nd hemistich we have only two expressed subjects, Pūṣan and Viṣṇu, but a plural verb dhāvan. The obvious solution, as seen by all, is to assume that other gods participated in this action.

The question is -- what action? The verb is generally assigned to √dhāv ‘run’.

Gr gives a transitive-causative value to this stem in this passage and this passage alone (Gr “jemandem [D.] etwas [A.] zuströmen”); Ge follows this trans. interpr.: “… liessen für ihn den … (Soma)stengel … strömen,” and indeed interprets another passage as having this value (IX.54.2). However, since all other acc. with √dhāv are goals to an intrans. verb of motion, this contextual adjustment is unacceptable. Gotō (1st Klasse, 183 and n. 325) disputes both of Ge’s trans. interpretations and fixes this passage by dividing the two pādas into two clauses. The first has an acc. goal sárāṃsi (“…eilen zu den drei [Soma]seen”), which seems reasonable (indeed cf. IX.54.2 ayáṃ sárāṃsi dhāvati), but he must supply a verb (‘gave’) out of thin air to make pāda d to work: “[sie geben] ihm den Vrtrat ̥ ötenden, berauschenden Somastengel.” The problem can be solved by assigning the verb to the other root √dhāv ‘rinse’, part of the standard vocabulary of soma preparation. VIII.2.25 (ā́dhāvata … sómaṃ vīrā́ya) presents an exactly parallel construction with soma as acc. obj. and the recipient, Indra, in the dat. Moreover, ‘rinse’ would add a complementary foodpreparation term to √pac ‘cook’ in pāda b, with both solid and liquid nourishment thus covered, whereas ‘run’ is a bit of a non sequitur. The only thing that gives me pause is X.113.2 tám asya víṣṇur mahimā́nam ójasā, aṃśúṃ dadhanvā́n …, where we have Viṣṇu, the aṃśú, and an undoubted 'run’ (to the separate root √dhan[v]). But this late passage does not seem to me sufficient to outweigh the fact that a ‘rinse’ interpr. here allows the hemistich to be a single syntactic unit and forestalls the need to supply a verb for d out of nowhere.
