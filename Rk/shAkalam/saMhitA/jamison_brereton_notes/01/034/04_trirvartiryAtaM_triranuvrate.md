suprāvyè: prāvī́- and related forms I take, following Old (Noten ad II.13.9; also Scar. 501) to √vī ‘pursue’, rather than to √av ‘help’ (e.g., Gr). The forms are specialized for the pursuit of ritual activities.

tredhéva “as if threefold” presumably refers to the Aśvins, who, though only being a pair, are as effective as if they were three.

With Ge (/WG) I take akṣárā (in akṣáreva) as nom. sg. fem., corresponding to the Aśvins, who are subject to pinvatam. See Old’s somewhat inconclusive disc.

(ZDMG 63 [=KlSch p. 310]) of the various options. Rivelex (I.16-17) takes it as a neut. nom. pl. collective; Gr. also as a neut. pl., though without specifying case.
