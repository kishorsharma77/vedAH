As noted in the publ. intro., the clichéd́ intro. “I shall proclaim (prá √vac) the manly deeds …” associated esp. with Indra hymns (esp. I.32) is here directed to both gods. The “real” subjunctive vocā is found only here in the RV, in contrast to the more common injunctive / functional subjunctive vocam.

The enclitic vām is unusually stationed pāda-final, but in fact it occupies 2nd position in its small clause, the loc. absol. sutéṣu vām “on (the soma-drinks) having been pressed for you two.” Ge takes vām with following vīryā̀(“euren Heldentaten”), but the pāda break that separates them makes that less likely. Re ignores the vām in his tr. and attaches the loc. absol. to the rel. cl., which is syntactically unlikely. Pādafinal vām is in fact a tic of this hymn; see 2a, 4a, and 5a besides our 1a. Perhaps it echoes the 2nd syllable of yuvám ‘you two’, found at pāda end in 1d, 2c.

The contents of the 2nd hemistich is quite dramatic. The standard view going back to Sāy. (see Ge’s n. 1c) is that the slain Fathers are the Asuras and that this event is also reflected in the enigmatic X.124. However, see my 2016 treatment of X.124, “The Divine Revolution of Ṛgveda X.124: A New Interpretation. Beyond Asuras and Devas” (Ged. Staal), which rejects the view that that hymn concerns the Deva/Asura conflict. Here in our passage, certainly the easiest interpretation is that the rivals of the gods are the Asuras, but keep in mind that the Deva/Asura conflict so prominent in the Brāhmaṇas and later does not really surface until very late RV.

Moreover, even in the old interpr. of X.124 neither Indra nor Agni appears to have been an Asura. I do not know what to make of our passage, but I doubt that the old interpr. holds.
