I take cde as consisting of two relative clauses, both introduced by yáyoḥ in c. The first is only pāda c and is a statement of ownership (“whose is this whole moving world,” phrased in the publ. tr. as “to whom … belongs”); the second comprises de, with yáyoḥ construed with vásu and Heaven and Earth the subj. of the dual verb bibhṛtáḥ. (Re’s tr. is sim.) Ge’s tr. differs from mine in taking cde as a single relative cl., with “this whole moving world” as a parallel subj. to Heaven and Earth. He must assume that bibhṛtáḥ has been attracted into the dual by the nearer paired subject. I prefer to take the dual verb seriously, and I also wonder if the moving world (which usually refers to the animate beings therein) has a collective lap. For the lap of Heaven and Earth, see nearby VIII.42.2 pātáṁ no dyāvāprthiv ̥ ī upásthe (in the same hymn cycle).

Judging by word order, iyáṃ dyaúḥ should belong together and I have so tr.

them. But iyám has the wrong deixis: iyám expresses near deixis and, when indicating a cosmic division, ordinarily characterizes the earth (cf., e.g., X.60.9 iyám prthiv ̥ ī́mahī́). It also has the dispreferred gender: dyaúḥ is ordinarily masc., though occasionally fem. Since demonstratives are often separated from their nouns, I am tempted to take it with pṛthivī́here (“heaven and this great earth”). But a series of passages in which the feminine near deictic does seem to belong with ‘heaven’ (prthiv ̥ ī́ṃ dyā́m utémā́m III.32.8, 34.8, X.88.3, 9, 121.1) gives me pause, and IX.96.3 dyā́m utémā́m is even worse, because it is not conjoined with an ‘earth’ word. So I have honored the word order as well as accepting the gender switch.
