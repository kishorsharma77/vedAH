mahé was mistakenly omitted in the publ. tr. Substitute “to great generosity.” I follow Old in taking góparīṇasā as standing for -āḥ, nom. pl. to a thematic stem, rather than, with Ge (and Pp.), as -ā and instr. sg. of the s-stem. In the simplex both párīṇas- and parīṇasá- exist, though the latter occurs only once (IX.97.9), where it is indirectly associated with cows/milk. Old points out that soma is generally the subject of √mand (as in 14b mandantu … índavaḥ), and taking góparīṇasā(ḥ) here as modifying a plural form of soma drinks or drops would save having to supply another element in the instrumental. However, Ge’s interpretation does have in its favor that the more common simplex is párīṇas- and that it is regularly found in the instrumental. ### 25-27 The proclamation of Indra’s deeds called for in 25c is presumably contained in the following two verses.
