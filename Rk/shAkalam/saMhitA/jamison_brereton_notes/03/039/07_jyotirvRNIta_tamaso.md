The IXth class vṛṇīta in pāda a is ambiguous: it can be either injunctive or optative; the standard tr. take it as the former, expressing straight past time. I instead interpr. it as optative, primarily because of the parallelism with 8a, where the light chosen in 7a, “should suffuse the two world-halves” with opt. ánu ṣyāt (note also syāma in 7b, 8b). However, the ambiguity of vṛṇīta allows it serve as pivot between the past-time narration of vss. 4-6 and the expressed wishes of 7-8.

The rendering of purutámasya in the publ. tr. makes it seem to qualify the hymns, not the bard. The tr. could be slightly emended to “… of the bard, who is the latest of many.”
