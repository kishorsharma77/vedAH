Both Ge and Re take iṣtá- in the cmpd. iṣtá-yāman- as belonging to the root √iṣ ‘send’ (e.g., “[d]er seine Fahrt beeilt” and see Ge’s n. 3a). But as Old (ZDMG 62 [1908] 473-74) points out, we should then expect *iṣitá-yāman-. (Like me, Old attributes iṣṭá- here to √iṣ ‘seek, desire’, though his interpr. of the cmpd. differs from mine.) The parallel passages with iṣṭáye in conjunction with √yā that Ge adduces in his n. (and others he doesn’t cite) all belong, in my opinion, to ‘seek, desire’, not ‘send’.
