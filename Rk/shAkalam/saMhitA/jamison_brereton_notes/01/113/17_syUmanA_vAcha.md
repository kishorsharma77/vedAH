Ge and Re take the singer, the subject of ab, as the human singer, which in turn requires them to interpret the mid. part. stávānaḥ, which is overwhelmingly passive in value, as having active meaning. I (and independently WG) take the referent in ab to be Agni (so already, tentatively, Old). This not only allows stávānaḥ to be interpreted in its usual fashion, but also fits the rest of the lexicon. Agni is regularly called váhni- in his standard role as conveyor of the oblation, and he is also called ‘hoarse-voiced’ because he crackles (cf. I.127.10, VI.3.6, VI.11.3).
