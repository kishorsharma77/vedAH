On ámati- see comm. ad I.73.2.

The problematic pāda is c. The rivers who are its subject are not, in my opinion, either real-world rivers (so, it seems, Ge) or the heavenly streams so beloved of Lü. Rather, to fit the context, they must be, metaphorically, the outpourings of light at dawn, which are so intense that they threaten to destabilize the world with their floods -- a threat countered by the solidity of Heaven described in pāda d. The two bahuvrīhis in c, dhánv-arṇasaḥ … khā́do-arṇāḥ, have been much discussed. Noteworthy first is the fact that they have (almost) the same final member: if both cmpds are nom. pl. the 2nd members are -arṇas- and -arṇa- respectively.

Thieme rejects the variation in stem, taking both as containing -arṇas-, which requires the 2nd form to be nom. singular. In his interpr. the many rivers described by dhánvarṇasaḥ have joined into one, modified by singular khā́doarṇāḥ. It is a clever solution, but rather over-clever and in fact unnecessary. Both árṇas- and árṇa- exist independently, and the plural built to a cmpd. with árṇas- as final member (that is, - arṇasaḥ) would not fit a Triṣṭubh cadence, while one built to the parallel stem -arṇadoes nicely, as if truncated from a Jagatī cadence with -arṇasaḥ (see such a cadence in I.182.7).

What then do the cmpds mean? Again, a variety of interpr. have been suggested. I take dhánv-arṇas- as an equational bv., ‘whose floods are dhánu-’. A dhánu- appears to be a high flat plain or steppe; two of its five occurrences in the RV are characterized as bṛhatī́- ‘lofty’. In our context I think it refers to what we often call a “wall of water,” a mass of oncoming water far above flood stage, perhaps already flooding over the banks and across the adjacent land. As for khā́do-arṇāḥ, it should mean something like ‘whose floods are a biting/devouring’; in this case, I think Ge (flg. Sāy.) is correct that the rivers are devouring their banks, eating away at the solid ground. The sturdy pillar of heaven in d provides a bulwark against this featureless undulating torrent of light.
