It is not clear what (if anything) utá is conjoining. Klein (DGRV I.371) says there’s an ellipsis of the verb in the 2nd clause, but he doesn't say what verb. I am reluctant to add semantics to utá of the type ‘even’, ‘also’, ‘especially’, as Re and Ge do in their different ways. In the publ. tr. the pf. part. śuśukvā́n is translated (“and when you blaze …”) as if it contrasted with an unexpressed different activity of Agni’s. I might now be inclined to take it as an implicitly subordinated circumstantial clause to be construed with the prohibitives of cd: “and when you blaze …, let not …” However, the tr. “when you …” obscures the fact that the verbal notion is expressed by a nom. sg. participle, which should (and does not) modify the subject of the mā́ clause(s) in cd. However, note that Agni is the subj. of the mā́clauses that occupy all of vs. 5.
