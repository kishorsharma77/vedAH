In c I construe ádhvanaḥ as an abl. with syannā́(ḥ) rather than a gen. with vimócane. The effective difference is trivial, but the image seems more dynamic if the horses, unhitched, rush off into the roadside pastures (perhaps in pursuit of the “dappled females,” though if the latter are antelopes, this would lead to species crossbreeding).
