Let these manly deeds of yours not get old because of us, and let the  brilliant deeds not age—let them not age before us.  
What glittering, immortal (deed) of yours shall sound anew in every  generation,  
o Maruts, fix that firm in us as well as (brilliance) difficult to surpass— and what is difficult to surpass.
