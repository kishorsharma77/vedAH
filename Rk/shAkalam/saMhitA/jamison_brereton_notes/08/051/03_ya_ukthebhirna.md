With Ge I read aviṣyántam, not áriṣyantam. See his n. on 3d. Old rejects the emendation, but since the áviṣyantam is found in the Khila collection and in “die gute ind. Ausgabe des Pp.,” I think the reading is justifiable, esp. given the poor transmission of the Vālakhilya. The publ. tr. should have an asterisk before “a man greedy for food.”
