The root-noun cmpd viśva-víd- is ambiguous, between ‘all-knowing’ and ‘allacquiring’ (see Scar 489). In this context, given svar-jít- ‘winning the sun’ (2b) and satrājít- ‘winning compeltely’ (4c), ‘acquiring all’ seems to work better; however, the very next hymn contains two instances of the same cmpd (IX.28.1, 5), where ‘knowing all’ is favored.
