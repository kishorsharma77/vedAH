Soma Pavamāna
Prabhūvasu Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Soma as the source and support of wealth and as ally in conflict is the theme of this  hymn, which is characterized by pleasing etymological figures (e.g., vss. 3, 4, 6) and  variant repetitions (e.g., vss. 2 + 5).
## 1
Bringing broad wealth for us, o self-purifying one, purify yourself in  a stream
with which you will find the light for us.
## 2
You drop who set the sea to swaying, who set all in motion, purify  yourself
as the supporter of our wealth with your strength.
## 3
With you as hero, you possessor of heroes, might we overcome those who  give battle.
Stream toward us what is choice.
## 4
The drop sends forth (its speech), the prizewinning seer seeking to win  the prize,
finding his commandments to be his weapons.
## 5
Him who sets speech to swaying do we clothe with songs as he is being  purified—
Soma, the herdsmaster of the people.
## 6
Under whose commandment all people find support—under that of the  master of support
who brings outstanding goods while he is being purified.
