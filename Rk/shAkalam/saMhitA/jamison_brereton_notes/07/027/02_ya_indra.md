The relative clause in the first pāda has no overt referent in the main clause of b, but I supply an instr. téna (see also Ge’s n.; his first alternative, to supply tám, is less attractive because śikṣa- doesn’t ordinarily take an acc.).

I interpret c as containing an implicit pun. The form vícetā(ḥ), masc. nom. sg.

of vícetas-, derived from the root √cit ‘perceive’, means ‘discriminating’, hence my ‘tell things apart’, and is regularly applied to Indra (and other gods). But this leaves dṛḷhā́with no verb to govern it. (It cannot be object of ápa vṛdhi in d, because the hí in c should trigger verbal accent.) I suggest that vícetā (in sandhi) might also be secondarily construed as the agent noun of ví √ci ‘pile apart, pull apart’, governing dṛḷhā́. Of course we would expect the Saṃhitā text to show coalescence of the final vowel of the agent noun and the initial vowel of the next pāda, but the recitational text would not reflect that. Although most agent nouns compounded with preverbs take suffix accent, compare nícetar- (I.184.2) to a different root √ci ‘perceive’. If this suggestion seems too radical, it would also be possible to detach the preverb ví from vícetā(ḥ) and supply a form of √vṛ ‘cover’ (found in ápa vṛdhi in d), producing the familiar lexeme ví √vṛ ‘uncover’.
