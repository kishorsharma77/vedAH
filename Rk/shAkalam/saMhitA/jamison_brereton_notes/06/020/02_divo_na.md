This vs. begins like vs. 1, with a form of ‘heaven’ followed by the simile marker ná (1a dyaúr ná, 2a divó ná). In this case there is nothing in the frame that explicitly corresponds to the gen. diváḥ in the simile, though the dat. túbhyam is roughly parallel: like the “lordship of heaven,” lordship was conceded to you (Indra) and is therefore yours.

The standard idiom for ‘concede’ is ánu √dā, not, as here, ánu √dhā. Cf., with phraseology similar to here, VI.25.8 ánu te dāyi … satrā́te víśvam … (sim.

II.20.8). But √dhā is also found in this idiom elsewhere, e.g., VI.36.2 satrā́dadhire ánu vīryā̀ya. Old (ZDMG 55.326, Noten) seems prepared to follow Gr (Tr.) and v.

Bradke in emending dhāyi to *dāyi, but this seems unnec. The two roots are formally very parallel and in many contexts their meanings are barely distinguishable; I see no reason why √dhā cannot have acquired this idiomatic meaning with ánu in imitation of ánu √dā. In this particular case ánu √dhā may have been used in preference to ánu √dā because of the technical use of anudéya- in vs. 11 below. See disc. there.

Note that the ‘lordship, lordly power’ (asuryà-) is in the control of the gods and conceded to Indra, another indication that the later Asura/Deva divide is not present in the core RV. See also VI.36.1 below.
