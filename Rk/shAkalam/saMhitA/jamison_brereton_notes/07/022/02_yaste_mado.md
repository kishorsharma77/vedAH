I tr. ásti as an existential (“exists to be yoked”) rather than simply a copula with the predicated gerundive yújyaḥ (“is to be yoked”) because the 3rd sg. pres. of √as is almost always an existential, given that the copula is almost always gapped.

However, this may be too emphatic a tr., and it is the case that a surface copula is more likely to be found in subordinate clauses than main clauses. See Jamison 1990 (“Tense of the Predicated Past Participle …,” IIJ 33: 1-19) pp. 4--5. The gerundive + asi in 7c (hávyaḥ … asi “you are to be invoked”) supports a simple copula interpr.
