Like almost every verse involving Uśanā, this one is quite obscure. On the morphology of the name, see my art. in Fs. Jasanoff; for the mythological background and development of Uśanā, chap. 4 in my RV between Two Worlds. I take this verse as a disguised treatment of the Vala myth, with which Uśanā Kāvya is associated elsewhere. Pāda a is also found at I.130.9; there I take Uśanā as an acc. of goal (or perhaps a gen. with a gapped ‘house’), while here I take it as an instr. As discussed in the Fs. Jasanoff article, the word uśánā behaves essentially like an indeclinable in the RV.

In my analysis the curious expression ukṣṇó rándhram “the loins of the ox” (on randhrá- see Gotō 1985 [MSS 44] and EWA s.v.) is a reference to the Vala cave: the loins are a weak or vulnerable spot in animals, and MIA randha- ‘opening, cleft, weak spot’ shows how easily this can develop into a word that might qualify a cave.

A similar circumlocution for the Vala cave is náme góḥ “in the bend of the cow” (III.39.6). Ge takes the phrase instead as a personal name; as he points out Ukṣṇo Randhra is a PN in PB 13.9.19/JB III.150 and has the epithet kāvya-, apropos of the so-called Aukṣṇorandhra Sāman, but this is surely a secondary reinterpretation of this opaque vs. The roaring in c is the noise of the cows penned inside the cave.

Note the phonetic echo in the initial words of the first two pādas: #uśanā \#ukṣṇas.
