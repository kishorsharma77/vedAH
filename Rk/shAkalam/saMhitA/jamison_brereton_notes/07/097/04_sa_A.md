The second pāda contains an equational rel. cl. with expressed copula ásti; main cl. equational expressions almost always lack copula (when asti is found, it is generally existential), but overt copulas are not uncommon in dependent clauses. It is of course optional; see the nominal rel. cl. in the preceding vs., 3d, which lacks copula.

Pāda c contains a phrase in the nominative, kā́mo rāyáḥ suvī́ryasya “desire for wealth in good heroes,” which is picked up abruptly by the acc. prn. tám, object of the immediately following verb dāt. There seems no other way to interpret it -- and it goes perhaps too easily into English -- but both the syntax and sense are slightly off.

The fronted expression seems like a topicalized phrase, but in Vedic topics would not default to the nominative but remain in the appropriate case for the larger syntactic frame; see in the next vs. the acc. phrase that occupies the whole of pāda a, which is the obj. of the verb in b. Moreover, one doesn’t give wishes/desires but rather the contents of those desires, so that the referent of tám may be rayí-, not kā́ma-. Both concerns suggest that the relationship between the kā́ma- phrase and the abbreviated táṃ dāt clause is less close than it appears. Re supplies some structure to the first phrase -- “(En nous est) le désir …” -- and something like that might produce the necessary distance.
