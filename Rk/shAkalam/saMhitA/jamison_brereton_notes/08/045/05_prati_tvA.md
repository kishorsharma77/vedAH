Śavasī is taken by many as the name of Indra’s mother, but there is no particular reason not to take it in its lexical sense, referring to the same woman.

The Pp. text divides the beginning of b into girā́v ápso, with the second word the s-stem ápsas- ‘breast’, a word otherwise used of Uṣas (I.124.7, V.80.6). But even in a proverbial expression such as this seems to be, where semantic latitude is to be expected, “like a/the breast/chest at a mountain” (or Ge “Wie mit der Brust gegen den Berg ...,” taking ápsaḥ as a truncated instr. *ápsasā) doesn’t make any sense. Old suggests a different word division: girā́vápso, with the latter being the word for ‘wasp’ found elsewhere in Indo-European, though not directly in Indo-Aryan (except, quite possibly, in I.181.8); see EWA s.v. vápsas-. This does allow sense to be made of the expression: the extraordinary size difference between a wasp and a mountain dooms the wasp, but wasps are notoriously belligerent and therefore willing to take on any opponent, however unlikely they are to defeat it. In the same way, anyone who is foolhardy enough to take on Indra will ensure certain defeat for himself.
