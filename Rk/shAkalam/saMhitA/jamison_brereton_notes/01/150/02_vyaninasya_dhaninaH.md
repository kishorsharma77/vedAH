This vs. is constructed in opposition to vs. 1. In vs. 1 the poet declares himself under the protection (śaraṇé) of Agni (gen.) as if under that of the sun (gen.); vs. 2 contains a number of genitives qualifying a negatively perceived person, who is therefore implicitly contrasted with the genitives of vs. 1. To support this balanced structure I supply “from the protection” (*śaraṇā́t) for the genitives to depend on (sim. WG) and a verb of motion with the preverb of separation ví that opens the verse (hence “(I go) away (from ...)”). There are, of course, other ways to supply the supporting structure.
