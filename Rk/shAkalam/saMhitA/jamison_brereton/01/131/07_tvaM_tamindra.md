You, powerfully born Indra, grown strong, being kindly toward
us: (smash) the mortal who acts the foe—that mortal, o champion,
with your mace—
smash (him and) whoever wishes us ill. Listen to (us), as the one who  listens best.
Let malevolence stay away, like an accident on a journey—let all
malevolence stay away.
