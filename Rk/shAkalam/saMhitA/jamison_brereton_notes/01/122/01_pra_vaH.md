On pā́ntam see Old’s lengthy n. ad loc. The stem pā́nt(a)-, generally read with distracted root syllable, occurs 8x in the RV. As Old demonstrates, there are most likely two different stems involved: a them. noun pā́nta- ‘drink’ and the act.

part. of the root aor. of √pā ‘drink’. The noun is the more common (6x), while the part. is most likely found only in vs. 4 of this same hymn (du. pā́ntā) and as nom. pl.

This image is especially appropriate for Rudra, a god of course famous as an archer, and the Maruts, who are depicted in
