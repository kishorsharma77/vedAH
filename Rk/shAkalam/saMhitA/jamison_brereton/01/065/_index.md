Agni  
Parāśara Śāktya  
10 verses: dvipadā virāj  
As is generally the case with dvipadā virāj meter, the hymn falls into two-verse units,  essentially equivalent to a single trimeter verse (forty syllables, versus forty-four  [triṣṭubh] or forty-eight [jagatī]). The five-syllable units in which the verses are orga nized lend themselves to brief, discrete semantic and syntactic units, producing a  mosaic-like effect. In this hymn, as in the following one, the mosaic fragments are  often similes—especially pronounced here in the middle verses 5–6, though found  throughout. Each simile highlights a particular aspect of Agni.  
The hymn also follows a ritual and mythological trajectory. It begins with the  hidden Agni (vs. 1), alluding in mythological terms to the well-known story of  Agni’s flight and rediscovery by the gods, which is treated in verses 2–3, but also, in  ritual terms, to the fire hidden in the wood before kindling. This kindling is accom  
plished by the end of the hymn, where Agni spreads through the firewood and  awakens at dawn, conspicuous and visible from afar (vss. 7–10). The relationship of  Agni to waters, in his identity as Apām Napāt, is another theme in the hymn (vss.  4–7, 9), though the epithet Apām Napāt is not mentioned.
