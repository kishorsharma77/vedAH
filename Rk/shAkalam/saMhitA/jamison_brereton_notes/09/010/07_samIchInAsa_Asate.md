Ge and Re take the seven siblings here as the seven dhītí- of 8.4 and 9.4, which is quite likely -- though the priests themselves are also a possibility. Ge adduces IX.66.8 sám u tvā dhībhír asvaran … saptá jāmáyaḥ “Together the seven siblings cried out to you with insightful thoughts,” which has both the 7 siblings and the thoughts -- but the referent of the siblings in that vs. is not clear. Ge there takes it as the fingers, which seems somewhat perverse, given that seven is not a canonical number for fingers -- and fingers don’t cry out.

I prefer rivers, since the “seven streams” were mentioned in the previous vs. ### 08
ā́dade belongs to √dā ‘bind’, not ‘give’; see, e.g., Kü 242. On the idiom see comm. ad I.139.1, IX.79.4.

Ge, Re, and Kü all take b as a simile (“wie das Auge an die Sonne”), presumably with cid as the simile particle. But, as I have stated elsewhere (see, e.g., comm. ad I.173.7), I am not at all convinced that cid is ever so used. Here, the point is the real identification of Soma, or his eye, with the sun, not a comparison to Soma’s kinship with me; see ékam ákṣi in 9.4, the transformation of Soma into sun(s) in our vs. 5c, and esp. the transformation of the sun’s eye into Soma’s eye in the next vs. (9c).

Gr identifies duhe in c as a 1st ps.; Ge and Re take it as 3rd sg. passive with ápatyam as subj. (e.g., “Die Nachkommenschaft des Sehers wird herausgemolken”), interpr. kaví- as a reference to Soma and ápatyam as the soma juice. But medial forms of √duh are generally transitive, with the sense ‘give X as milk’, and I follow that interpr. here, with Soma the unexpressed subject/agent. I suggest that c explains a: “binding his navel to our navel” means that he makes himself our kin and indeed takes responsibility for providing us with offspring. I take kavéḥ as referring to the (human) poet. Soma repays our devotion and care (see esp. vs. 7) with the usual ritual rewards, including sons.
