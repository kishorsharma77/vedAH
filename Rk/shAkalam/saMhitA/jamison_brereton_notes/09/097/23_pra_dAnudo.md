Since √pū does not appear with prá, it’s best to supply a verb of motion with the prá opening pāda a and take b (with pavate) separately. Note the alliteration in pāda a … dānudó divyó dānu(-pinváḥ).

This vs. identifies Soma as ‘truth’ (ṛtám b) and also contains in c the possessive internal deriv. dharmán- to dhárman-. If I am correct that jyéṣṭhasya … dhármaṇi in the immed. preceding vs. 22b should be interpr. “on the foundation of preeminent (truth -- ṛtásya), both resonant words, ṛtá- and dhárman-/dharmán-, were already implicitly present in the previous vs. In 23 Soma is then depicted as the embodiment of these words (cf. Ge’s “das (verkörperte) Gesetz” for ṛtám), and they define his kingship (rā́jā in c, also in 24b). Unfortunately it does not seem possible to signal the dhárman- / dharmán- connection in English tr., but ‘possessor of the (royal) mandate’ may be too specialized for the latter. Perhaps better ‘founder, foundation-giver, institutor, maintainer’. On Soma as “truth” see also IX.107.15 and IX.108.8.

The ten reins are presumably the fingers of the presser, as is usual for ten anything in IX.
