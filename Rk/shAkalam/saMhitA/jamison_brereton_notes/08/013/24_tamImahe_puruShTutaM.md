Pāda b yahvám pratnā́bhir ūtíbhiḥ is a deliberate echo of 20a yahvám pratnéṣu dhā́masu, and the only indication that yahvám is neut. in 20b but masc. in 24b are the pronouns tád and tám respectively that open the a-pādas. The phrase pratnā́bhir ūtíbhiḥ also recalls pravátvatībhir ūtíbhiḥ in 17b. These patterns suggest there is some reality to the below-the-radar thematic unity I’ve sketched out for the three tṛcas, vss. 16-24.
