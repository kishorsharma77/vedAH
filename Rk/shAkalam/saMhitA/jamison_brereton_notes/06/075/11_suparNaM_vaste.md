The “eagle” is of course the feathers that provide the fletching at the back end of the arrow. The “tooth” of the arrow is presumably its tip -- the arrowhead -- so called because it “bites” its target. The arrowhead is quite unlikely to have been made from a deer’s tooth, however -- their teeth being short and flat and unsuitable for piercing. But acdg to the internet, deer antlers were/are used for primitive arrowheads. The cows in pāda b are of course leather sinews, and again the internet tells us that sinew was/is frequently used to attach the arrowhead to the shaft (with some how-to advice, which generally involves chewing on the leather first).

Pāda b recalls 5d, though the material objects in questions are different, the quiver in 5, the arrow in 11: pāda-final prásūtā matches prásūtaḥ in 5d in the same metrical position, and both contain the past part. of √nah ‘tie’ earlier in the pāda, also in the same metrical position, 5d x x nínaddhaḥ, 11b x x sáṃnaddhā The verb of pāda d is literally “run together and apart” (sáṃ ca ví ca drávanti), but “clash and separate” seemed to me to have a better ring.
