The priestly subject of this vs. is the Potar, found in the final pāda, but there is a teaser in pāda b, in the form of an agent noun nétar- ‘leader’ in the expression yajñásya netári “to/in the leader of the sacrifice.” But netár- is not a technical priestly role; the real priestly title derived from the root √nī is Neṣṭar, found in vs. 5 (néṣṭuḥ).
