As usual, the form iṣé is subject to multiple possible analyses, but most interpr. opt for a dat. of íṣ- ‘refreshment’, as do I. With most (but not Old), I split pāda a into two nominal clauses, based on the apparently clause-initial sequence ā́hí after the caesura. The enclitic naḥ must of course belong properly to the 1st clause, though it can be understood with the 2nd as well.

In pāda b, the referent in the simile qualified as párijmā ‘encompassing’ has been variously identified: Ge (sim. Lü) Vāyu, Re the sun or Agni solaire, Gr Agni himself. By contrast, I supply ‘household’ (gáya-), on the basis of nearby VI.2.8, where Agni is said to be párijmeva … gáyaḥ “encompassing like a household” (on which see comm. ad loc.). This simile would play on Agni’s well-known connection to the domestic sphere. The point of comparison is that the household is the unit that controls the wealth of its members. I supply “over treasure” on the basis of rátnam in pāda a; kṣayasi in b needs a gen. complement to parallel the simile in c: mitró ná bṛhatá ṛtásya.
