The med. 3rd pl. pīpayanta here echoes act. 3rd pl. pīpayan in I.152.6b and both are transitive: the form in our vs. is simply an -anta replacement/variant of the usual type. Both have cows as (partial) subjects (dhenávaḥ and gā́vaḥ respectively), but in I.152.6 the cows are, in my view, the streams of ghee swelling the fire, while here the cows and waters are the usual additions to the soma drink. Agni is not absent, however, at least in my view: the lord of the house in c is probably Agni, and his position as ‘foremost’ (pūrvyáḥ) refers to his placement to the east as the Āhavanīya fire.

In d the naked vītám can be fleshed out by comparison with I.151.3 vītho adhvarám, despite Ge’s “Bekommet Lust” and Re’s “Goûtez”; WG’s “Verfolgt!” at least reproduces the same verb they use for vīthaḥ in I.151.3.
