Maruts
Evayāmarut Ātreya
9 verses: atijagatī
This final hymn of Maṇḍala V is clearly an addition to the original collection, and  it is composed in an unusual lyric meter found only in this hymn and a few scat tered verses in the rest of the saṃhitā, consisting of five pādas arranged in two  half-verses: 12 12 / 12 8 8. (It is convenient here to place the final two pādas on  a separate verse line.) The end of the first hemistich of each verse is marked by  the unusual formation evayā́marut, which serves as an internal refrain, syntacti cally unconnected to the rest of the verse. This word is aberrantly formed, and  our translation reflects what we consider its intent, rather than a literal value. (The  Anukramaṇī names Evayāmarut as the poet of this hymn, but the name is obvi ously secondarily derived from the refrain. We would not be surprised if Śyāvāśva  was responsible for this playful Marut hymn.) Indeed, the syntax is lax in a number  of verses, which appear to be constructed of metrical phrases with internal syntac tic unity but loosely strung together.
In terms of content the most striking feature is the close association between the  god Viṣṇu and the Maruts. The Maruts are mentioned with Viṣṇu in other places  in the R̥gveda, but not in such a sustained fashion as here. The thematic connection  between them is not entirely clear, but Viṣṇu’s famous three strides from earth to  heaven, via the midspace, do remind us of the ever-journeying Maruts, who gener
ally inhabit the midspace but are found also both in heaven and on earth.
