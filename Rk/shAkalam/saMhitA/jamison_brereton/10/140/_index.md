Agni
Agni Pāvaka
6 verses:  viṣṭārapaṅkti 1, satobr̥hatī 2–4, upariṣrḁ̄ jjyotis 5, triṣṭubh 6 [per the  Anukramaṇī, but this doesn’t accurately reflect the meter of 5 and 6. Former is rather  satobr̥hatī, while latter is 12 12 12 8]
Metrically varied but unremarkable in contents, this hymn recycles and enchains its  vocabulary and phraseology while staying close to its core message: the ritual fire is  lovely and brilliant, and it brings—or should bring—precious prizes to the humans  who tend it.
