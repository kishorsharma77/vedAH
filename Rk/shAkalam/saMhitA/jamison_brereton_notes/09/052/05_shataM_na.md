The two numbers in ab, śatám and sahásram, participate in meaningless syntactic variation. Both must ultimately express an instrumental relationship to the verb; in the first the instr. is directly expressed by ūtíbhiḥ, but in the 2nd the instr. must be assumed (“[with] a thousand”) and the enumerated substance is expressed by a partitive genitive. It’s a clever little slippage and barely noticeable. See Old’s disc.
