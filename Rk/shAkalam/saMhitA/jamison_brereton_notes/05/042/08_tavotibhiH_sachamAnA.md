The standard tr. (incl. also Schmidt, B+I 84 and Scar 202) take ab as a separate nominal cl. The difference is trivial.

Less trivial is the difference between my rendering of the last part of d and that of all the others. They take subhágās téṣu rā́yaḥ as the nominal main clause to the rel. cl. (yé aśvadā́ḥ …) that occupies the rest of the hemistich. Cf., e.g., Ge “denen gehören die beglückenden Reichtümer.” In contrast I take subhágāḥ with the rel. cl., qualifying the givers, and rā́yaḥ as acc. pl. in the main cl., and in the main cl.

I supply a verb ‘confer’ (vel sim.) extracted from ratnadhéyam in 7a. In favor of the standard tr. are the facts that by accent rā́yaḥ is better analyzed as nom. than acc. (though acc. pl. so accented are not rare) and that no verb need be supplied. Although I am usually reluctant to supply material, in this case there are countervailing factors.

First, with the exception of one late passage (X.140.5), subhága-, which is quite well-attested, is only used of animate beings, not of wealth or the like. Moreover, the standard rendering leaves Bṛhaspati with little to do. The givers are “accompanied by your help” (távotíbhiḥ), but otherwise seem to do quite nicely on their own -- whereas we might expect him to be acting on their material behalf by giving to them, just as in the next vs. he is asked to strip the niggardly of their possessions and do worse by other anti-ritualists. By my interpr. the vs. expresses the usual Rigvedic trickle-down theory of material redistribution: the gods give goods to the patrons of the sacrifice (kings, etc.), who then confer them on the priests and poets.
