codayitrī́maghónaḥ is perfectly ambiguous, since maghónaḥ could be either gen. sg. or acc. pl. In the former case it would refer to Indra, the archetypal maghávan-, in the latter to the pl. patrons (the sūrí- referred to in pāda a). According to the standard distribution of cases, suffix-accented -tár- agent nouns should take the gen.; indeed our stem does just that in I.3.11 codayitrī́sūnṛ́tānām. However, this distribution is not absolute, and given the recent mention of the pl. patrons and the absence of Indra from this hymn (and mostly from this hymn cycle), a pl. reading is quite possible as well.

sūnṛ́tātvatī at the end of c forms a faint ring with sūnárī at the end of vs. 1.

Note that it also recalls I.3.11 just cited.
