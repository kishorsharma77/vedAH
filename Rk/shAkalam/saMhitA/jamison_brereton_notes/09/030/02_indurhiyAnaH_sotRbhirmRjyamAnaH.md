It is not clear how to interpr. indriyám in the phrase vagnúm indriyám, as also in similar expressions: I.92.1 ślókam indriyám, VIII.52.7 hávanam ... indriyám. Most take it to mean “Indra-like,” that is, presumably, loud, powerful (e.g., Ge “ein indrahaftes Geschrei”).

I think it more likely that it identifies the cry as “destined for Indra, appropriate to Indra.” Indra is always the special target of invocation in the Soma maṇḍala and VIII.52 is an Indra hymn. Of course, both senses could be meant.
