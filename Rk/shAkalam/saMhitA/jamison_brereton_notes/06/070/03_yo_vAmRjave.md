On the double etym. figure prá prajā́bhir jāyate, see comm. ad VIII.27.16.

With Re I take dhármaṇas pári with a full lexical sense of each element, rather than, with Ge, as a weakened adverbial “pflichtgemäss” (dutifully). Heaven and Earth provide the physical foundation (dhárman-) starting from which the pious man can found his family line, just as Heaven and Earth themselves took their places (apart) according to the dhárman- of Varuṇa in 1c.

The abundant references to real liquids in vss. 1-2 find their metaphorical expression in the creatures ‘poured out’ (siktā́) from Heaven and Earth (d). This ppl.

picks up the imperative rétaḥ siñcatam “pour the semen” addressed to H+E in 2d.

However, I take the implicit subj. of siktā́to be bhúvanā ‘creatures’ vel sim. (see 1a), not, with Gr, rétāṃsi ‘semens’. prajā́ḥ ‘progeny, offspring’ from the previous pāda would also be possible; it would only require altering the Pp reading siktā́to fem. pl.

siktā́ḥ, but no alteration to the Saṃhitā text.

My “poured out from you” of course tacitly misrepresents the case of dual yuvóḥ, which must be gen.-loc., not abl. But it’s worth noting that the 2nd du abl.

yuvát is attested only once in the RV, and I take yuvóḥ as an ex. of the all-purpose genitive: poured out from you and hence yours.

The explicitly contrastive víṣurūpāṇi sávratā reminds us of the phrase in the Yama/Yamī hymn X.10.2, sálakṣmā … víṣurūpā, describing Yamī compared to Yama: “having the same marks, but dissimilar form.” ### 04-05 These two vss., concerning ghee and honey respectively, have similarly structured 1st halves: a case form of the substance opens the vs. (4a ghṛténa, 5a mádhu), while the 2nd pāda consists of three 3 cmpds in the dual with the substance as 1st member. The 2nd members do not repeat (ghṛta-śríyā ghṛta-pṛ́cā ghṛtā-vṛ́dhā; madhu-ścútā madhu-dúghe mádhu-vrate), but only the last two are not root noun cmpds.
