Waters, your ceremonial share of Waters which the waters hold, which aids our sacrifice to Gods, This as a remnant here I leave. Do not thou wash it clean away. With this we let the man go by who hates us and whom we abhor. Him would I fain o'erthrow and slay with this our ceremonial act, with this our prayer, our thunder-bolt.
