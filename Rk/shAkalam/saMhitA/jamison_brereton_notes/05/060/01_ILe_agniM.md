The opening of the hymn, ī́ḷe agním, is a flipping of the opening of the first hymn in the RV, I.1.1 agním īḷe, but this phrase, in both orders, is found a number of times in the RV. However, it’s worth noting that this is the only other place where it opens a hymn. This is the only occurrence of the ppl. prasattá- ‘seated to the fore/in front’, and it here seems a substitute for the standard puróhita- ‘placed in front’, of Agni as the offering fire on the ritual ground. If ī́ḷe agním is a conscious evocation of RV I.1.1 (or a templatic Agni hymn), then prasattáḥ could be evoking the third word of I.1.1 (agním īḷe) puróhitam.

However, the gambling phrase that follows goes off in a very different direction; as is recognized by all standard tr., the phrase ví cayat kṛtám is dicing vocabulary. For the VP see I.132.1 and Falk (1986, Bruderschaft und Würfelspiel, pp.

126-28).
