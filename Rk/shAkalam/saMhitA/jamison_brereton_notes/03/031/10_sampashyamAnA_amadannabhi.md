What “the milk of the age-old semen” means is unclear to me. Ge suggests that they’re milking their old cows, but the rhetoric seems rather overblown just to express that. Lü (620-21, fld. by Schmidt 168) identifies the semen as ṛtá- and the milk as the Kultlied of the Aṅgirases. This may well be, but nothing imposes this explanation, and Schmidt in fact worries briefly (173) that logically the Aṅgirases should already have their Kultlied since they should have used it to free these very cows. On niṣṭhā́- ‘outstanding’ see Old, Scar (648-49). The word must be derived from nís √sthā, not ní √sthā and in fact goes literally into English as ‘stand out’, with the same idiomatic meaning. In addition to two occurrences of the simplex (this and IX.110.9), it is found in several compounds: karma-niṣṭhā́- X.80.1 a hero who stands out through his work, puruniṣṭhā́- V.1.6 (of Agni), VIII.2.9 ‘standing out among many’ of soma. Ge (unaccountably) takes it as ‘Verteilung’ (fld. by Re, Lü 528-29, Schmidt 168), an interpr. about which Old comments rather acidly. Old’s own interpr.

is essentially reproduced here and was also adopted by WG.

Note the partial responsion between ghóṣa in c and góṣu in d, in the same metrical position.
