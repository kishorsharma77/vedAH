Agni
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: triṣṭubh
This brief hymn describes Agni’s appearance “in his own home” (vs. 1b) and “in the  household” (vs. 2b), but although he is a domestic fire, Agni also extends to heaven  and earth and the four directions (vs. 1cd). Agni’s principal function here is to pro tect the household against unnamed difficulties (vss. 2a, 2c) and accusations (vs. 2c).  It is because he protects the family that he is Varuṇa and Mitra (vs. 3a), since these  two gods guard the structure of the household and of the larger society.
## 1
We have come with great reverence to the youngest one, who, kindled,  shines in his own home—
to him of shimmering radiance between the two wide world-halves, to  him facing out in every direction, receiving the well-poured offering. 2. Overcoming all difficulties by his greatness, Agni is praised in the  household as Jātavedas.
He will guard us from difficulty and reproach, (guard) both us, who are  singing, and our generous patrons.

You, Agni, are Varuṇa and Mitra. You do the Vasiṣṭhas make strong  through their thoughts.
In you let there be good things easy to gain. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.
