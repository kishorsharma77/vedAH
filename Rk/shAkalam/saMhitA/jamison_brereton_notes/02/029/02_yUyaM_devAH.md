The sequence in pāda c, abhikṣattā́ro abhí ca kṣámadhvam, invites interpr. as an etymological figure, but the agent noun, as it stands, must belong to √kṣad ‘mete out, apportion.’ Old tentatively suggests an emendation to abhikṣantā́r- (√kṣam), though he also allows that the transmitted reading may be correct and the poet is playing with Gleichklang. This seems the better course, esp. given that the stem is found once elsewhere (VII.21.8), though abhí is not otherwise attested with this root.

It’s worth noting that abhí √kṣam is found only in this little group of hymns (II.28.3, II.33.1, 7, in addition to this).

The reason for the accent on the main verbs (abhí …) kṣámadhvam … mṛḷáyata is not entirely clear, since neither begins its clause or pāda and they are not subordinated. They must be implicitly contrasted in some way, but, impressionistically, other such sequences are not accented.

The three ca’s in cd signal two differerent conjunctions. The first, in the preverb + verb sequence abhí ca kṣámadhvam, conjoins this impv. with mṛḷáyata in d, in an inverse ca construction (X ca … Y); the 2nd two, in d, conjoin the temporal expressions adyā́ca … aparáṃ ca. This is Klein’s view as well (DGRV I.188, 190, 155; cf. II.39).
