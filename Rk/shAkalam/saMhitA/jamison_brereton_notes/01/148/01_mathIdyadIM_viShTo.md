As in I.141.3 the homonymous roots √math ‘steal’ and ‘churn’ probably both contribute to this passage, with the former in mythological, the latter in ritual context.

The identity of the second member of the hapax cmpd. viśvā́psu- here and in the apparently related viśvápsu- (3x) is disputed. The explanation now current (accepted by Mayrhofer, EWA s.v. psu- and reflected in WG’s tr.) is Thieme’s derivation (Gram.Kat. 539) from √bhas ‘breathe’, hence ‘ganz aus Atemhauch bestehend’. However, this sense does not fit the passages very well, and for these compounds I therefore prefer Re’s derivation from vásu- (EVP 3.29, 12.107-8), despite Thieme’s criticisms and the phonological difficulties. Dīrghatamas seems to play with this word: note the scrambling in pāda d vápuṣe, and in his I.162.22 viśvápúṣam ‘all prospering’ seems another variant. Somewhat more tenuous, note that the companion qualifier here, viśvádevyam twice elsewhere appears with pūṣán-, once also in I.162., vs. 3 (also X..92.13).
