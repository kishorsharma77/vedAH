WG suggest that átyā(ḥ) is a hapax related to ánta- ‘border, edge’, ántya-, tr.

‘Begrenzungen’. Since no other forms show such a putative zero-grade, since ántyais not found in the RV, since the stem átya- is well attested, and since there is no metrical advantage to reducing an *antyā(ḥ) here to átyā(ḥ), this suggestion doesn’t merit adopting. In a hymn of this nature, the females might as well be steeds as boundaries. For other attempts to reinterp. átyā(ḥ) see those rejected by Old and another given by Ge (n. 2c).
