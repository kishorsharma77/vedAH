Another etymological figure appears in c: vṛjánena vṛjinā́n “… the bent ones [i.e., morally twisted or corrupt] with his band [i.e., his circle of helpers bent around him],” both derived from √vṛj ‘twist’, though the semantic connection is somewhat less obvious than in the etymological figures in 3ab.

There is another, thematic connection between vss. 3 and 6. As there, Indra here achieves his victory first with his comrades (śárdha- 3a), then with his tricks (that is, by “out-tricking” [amināt] with his shape-shifting abilities, várpa- 3b). In such cases his overwhelming strength might be almost superfluous -- hence my parenthetical “(though).” Note that abhíbhūti- (abhí √bhū) is a different lexical realization of abhiṣṭí- in 4b (if to abhí √as, as is the common opinion; cf. EWA s.v.).
