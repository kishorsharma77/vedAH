In this vs. (which is also repeated as IV.4.13, where it is transparently secondary; see comm. there) the masc. pl. rel. yé seems to have a referent in the main cl. expressed by a form of the sá/tám prn., as would be expected: acc. tā́n sukṛ́taḥ “those of good (ritual) action.” The publ. tr. reflects this apparently transparent relative / antecedent relationship: Agni’s protectors are themselves protected by Agni.

However, the problem is that the sukṛ̥́taḥ would normally be the sacrificers, not Agni’s protectors (pāyávaḥ), who should be helping Agni to protect the sukṛ́taḥ.

Hence the move by Ge and Re to supply a parenthetical “with them” in the main cl.: “your protectors who guarded …, (with them) he guarded those of good action.” The instr. pl. pāyúbhiḥ is elsewhere used in constr. with an impv. ‘protect!’ addressed to Agni (I.31.12, 95.9, 143.8). In contrast to Ge and Re, Old (Noten) argues for interpreting the syntax as it stands, and the renderings of WG and Kü (412) also do not supply an instr. in the main clause. I am of two minds; on the one hand, a rendering with supplied instr. seems to reflect the usual RVic situation better, but, on the other, syntactically the yé … tā́n construction is unimpeachable and the poet may have been aiming to express something slightly out of the ordinary. In the end I’ll let the publ. tr. stand, but with some question.

The juxtaposition of impf. arakṣan in the rel. cl. and rarákṣa in the main cl. is striking and begs for some functional differentiation. Kü (412) tr. “schützten” and “geschützt hat” respectively but doesn’t otherwise discuss. The action of the rel. cl.

took place in the (semi-)mythological past while the main cl. may refer to the ritual near-past with present relevance.
