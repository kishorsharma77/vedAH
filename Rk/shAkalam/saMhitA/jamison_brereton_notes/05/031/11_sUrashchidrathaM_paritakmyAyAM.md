I think that this vs. is structured by the implicit contrast between jātá- and náviṣṭha-, both used of Indra, but I seem to be alone in this (though see Gr’s lapidary comment s.v. náviṣṭha). Ge (/WG) take náviṣṭham as adverbial (Ge “aufs neue,” WG “zum letzten Mal”). This is certainly possible, but if it is taken as modifying Indra, the sense becomes more complex and interesting. In the first hemistich “I” announce the famous stable Indra of myth and authority, born (jātám) for these roles and continuously occupying them, but in the second hemistich it is the Indra of the ritual who’s the focus -- the Indra who is newly brought to every new ritual and whose epiphany is like a new creation every time, caused by the ritual actions themselves.
