As noted in the publ. intro., the NP in the gen. that occupies the first hemistich (and part of pāda c) remains unresolved until the governing verb, ápāḥ ‘you have drunk’, which opens the second hemistich. The referent of this phrase -- namely soma -- also remains unresolved until the very end of pāda b, with the tip-off mádhvaḥ ‘of the honey’. (Though initial mandrásya ‘gladdening’ might appear to point to soma, in fact it’s far more often used of Agni.)
