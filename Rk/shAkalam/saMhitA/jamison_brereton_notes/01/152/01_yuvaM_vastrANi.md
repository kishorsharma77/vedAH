Ge (/WG) take the “garments of fat” to be rain, though WG consider a reference to a libation also possible. Given the ritual focus of the previous and following hymns, and esp. I.151.8a yuvā́ṃ yajñaíḥ prathamā́góbhir añjate “They anoint you first with sacrifices and with cows,” I take the garments of fat to be the oblations offered to them.

Pāda b is likewise unclear, in part because the sense of mántu- is not entirely understood: seen comm. ad IX.73.6. Assuming ‘counsels’ is a reasonable rendering, I think the point is that M+V provide us with an unending stream of good advice.
