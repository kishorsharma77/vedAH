With Old, I reject the interpr. of cid in abc as a simile particle (contra Sāy and Ge); in all three cases the cid can be interpreted in its usual ‘even, even though, just’ sense. However, I differ from Old on the purport of the vs. He thinks it describes concrete events, possibly as a “Beschreibung von Zauberhandlungen,” while I think it contains two figurative descriptions of the impotence of the enemy -- in this I am closer to Ge’s notion of similes than to Old. I also find myself in the odd position of being in general agreement with Griffith’s interpr. (based on Ludwig’s).

Each hemistich describes an action involving great effort and drama that produces trivial and insubstantial results. In ab an ax is thoroughly heated, but this formidable weapon only cuts off the blossom of a silk cotton tree. (That silk cotton tree flowers are a vivid red might remind the audience of the real blood that might have been shed by a blazing hot ax.) In cd a pot, also heated, is boiling (yéṣantī), indeed has boiled over (práyastā), but all it produces is foam.
