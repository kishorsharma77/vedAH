As Ge points out, pāda a recalls VI.1.9a with īje śaśamé as here; the addition of ṛdhát- in pāda b also recalls VI.2.4a ṛ́dhat … śaśámate. In fact, the diction of the first hymns in this Agni cycle is very similar; cf. e.g., the repetition of áṃhas- (VI.2.3, 11; 3.1.2, 4.8), the use of the verb √naś (ā́naṭ VI.1.9, aśyām VI.1.13, naśat 2.5, naśate 3.1, 2, aśyā́ma 4x 5.7), etc. Other echoes have been treated elsewhere in the comm. The two forms of naśate in these first two vss. express mirror images: the first (1b) has the virtuous mortal as subject, suitably rewarded by attaining the light; the 2nd (2d) has the same mortal as object, with the verb negated, to express the evils that will not reach the mortal.
