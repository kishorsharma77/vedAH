The repetitions and lexical and phonological echoes that have served Nodhas well in the first three verses increase here, to an almost incantatory level. To point to a few of these: a sá suṣṭúbhā sá stubhā́(again a syncopation, as in 3c); b svaréṇa … svarí yo …; c: saraṇyubhiḥ echoes the sá’s of a and the s(v)ar’s of b, while finding its own faint echo in the final śakra of the pāda; d ráveṇa is a virtual anagram of svaréṇa in b, darayo is almost a rhyme form of svarí yo in b in the same metrical position, and both svarí yo and darayo precede the hemistich-final words ending in - gvaiḥ.

All other tr. take this verse as a single sentence with 2nd ps. subj. However, as I have shown (1992: “sa figé”), sá with 2nd ps. reference is limited to imperatives and should not appear with an injunctive like darayaḥ. I therefore consider the first hemistich to continue the 3rd ps. reference of vs. 3, with a switch to 2nd ps. in the second half. This type of switch is quite common in the RV.

In c I do not take saraṇyú- and phaligá- as personal names, pace Ge et al. The tr. ‘bolt’ for the latter follows Hiersche (Asp., ‘Riegel, Vershluss’), based on a possible connection with parigha- (Up+) ‘iron bar for shutting a door/gate’; see EWA s.v. However, as ET points out, a less specific sense such as ‘barrier’ would fit the contexts better and would also make fewer assumptions about early technology.
