This vs. appears to have no main clause. I take it as loosely attached to the preceding vs., while Ge attaches it to the next one. Old (fld. by WG) disputes the Nebensatz analysis, pointing first to the odd doubly accented Pp. analysis of prā́sṛjaḥ as prá ásṛjaḥ: if the verb is accented, we would expect univerbation with the preverb and loss of the preverb accent. He instead suggests that yád is to be construed with the participial phrase vṛtráṃ jaghanvā́n, as if it contained the finite verb jagántha -- a mixed construction. I am in general reluctant to allow a subordinating conjunction to have domain over a participle, and in this particular case this assumption would further require bits of the main clause and the subordinate clause to be interwoven in a fashion unprecedented (as far as I know) even in RVic syntax: the major part of the subordinate clause would be plunked down between the object of the main verb, apáḥ, and that verb (prā́sṛjat), and the 2nd half verse would consist of NPs modifying the object of the subordinate clause but following the end of the main clause. I do admit that the position of yád dha in pāda a suggests a close relation with the participial phrase, but I do not consider that position sufficient to override the arguments against that analysis.

The vs. contains several nice oppositions: śáyānam … cáratā “(him) lying (still) with (your) moving (weapon)” and the etymological devī́r ádevam “the goddesses, godless …” In addition note the etymological pun: vṛtrám … vavrivā́ṃsam.
