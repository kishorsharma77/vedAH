Ge takes ārokā́ḥ (only here in RV) as “Maschen” (mesh), and this does seem to be the meaning in late Vedic. This idiomatic sense presumably developed from ‘light flashing through openings’ to the ‘openings’ themselves. However, mesh or netting does not seem a particularly apt comparison here, and I prefer to take the word in a more literal, but still concrete, sense, esp. since rocate appears several times in the hymn (8c, 10b). By ‘brilliants’ I mean gems or gem-like objects (rhinestones, e.g., had they been invented then) that catch and flash light. A more abstract sense, like ‘flashes’ or ‘flares’, risks near identity with what it’s being compared with (tvíṣaḥ).

The force of the particle pile-up ghéd áha is not entirely clear to me, but this poet is partial to it. See ghéd … áhā in 30, as well as ghéd in 29, áha in 8. I have not found ghéd (…) áha elsewhere in the RV.
