Indra and Pūsaṇ
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: gāyatrī
Indra and Pūṣan are invoked together at the very beginning of this hymn, in a  construction (the dual dvandva) that implies habitual intimacy. In the next two  verses (2–3) their contrastive attributes are used as definitional descriptors; in verse  2 Indra is the first identified, while in verse 3 the order is the opposite. The end of  verse 3 and verse 4 seem to background Pūṣan while foregrounding Indra’s great  deeds, but the final two verses (5–6) return them to equality, and indeed in both  verses Pūṣan is mentioned first, with Indra almost an afterthought. The implied  equipoise between the two gods would of course be amusing to a Vedic audience,  given the sharp distinction between their importance in the pantheon.
In the translation we have retained as much as possible the order of the ele ments, even though this violates normal English patterns, because the balance  between the two gods and their qualities is conveyed by their careful stationing in  the verse.
