The standard tr. take the two loc. phrases in pāda a as real locationals, but I consider it unlikely that the Adhvaryu (who is Agni himself) would stand on the barhis, which would unhelpfully go up in smoke. Rather these should be loc. absolutes, as Old (SBE) takes them. In this particular case the loc. absolutes seem to be used, in conjunction with the aor. indic. ūrdhváḥ … asthāt, to indicate two layers of prior action before the present indicatives indicating the current ongoing ritual action, namely the circumambulation associated with the animal sacrifice (see publ.

intro.), here expressed by eti in pári … eti in cd. The two loc. absolutes express the first layer of action: the barhis must be strewn and the fire kindled. Once the fire has been kindled, there comes the second layer of action, resulting directly from the first: the fire stands upright -- that is, catches and flames up. Only then can the firebrand be taken out and the circumambulation (pári … eti) begun. Thus, the aor. does express its usual sense of immediate past action, but English “has stood upright” does not capture this sense here. It might be better “Once the ritual grass had been strewn and the fire kindled, the Adhvaryu stood upright ... (Now) Agni circles ...” I thank IH for causing me to think this through more thoroughly.
