Elliptical and with some syntactic puzzles. See Old on the verse in general and the multiple solutions proposed in earlier lit.

In b I supply “be there” as the verb; Ge, to more or less the same effect, “beistandest.” In c I supply Śuṣṇa as the object of both verbs, since he is the demon Indra ordinarily slays for Kutsa. The problem here is that the verbs are not parallel: injunctive śiśnathaḥ followed by imperative ní codaya. Somewhat reluctantly I ascribe imperatival value to śiśnathaḥ (so also Ge without comment), possible because of the functional shape-shifting ability of injunctives. (See the same form in VIII.70.10.) However, I am not certain how often regular injunctives can show imperatival value, as opposed to lexicalized forms like dā́ḥ and dhā́ḥ. The root √cud does not otherwise appear with ní, a fact that makes its value here even less clear. Ge supplies “horses” as object, while Old suggests importing ávaḥ ‘help’ from a.
