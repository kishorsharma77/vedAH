I tr. amita- as ‘matchless’ rather than ‘immeasurable’ because of its etym.

connection with pratimā́na- ‘match’ (6c, 8a), amātrá- ‘matchless’ (7c).

The Pp. reads akalpáḥ in c, and following this reading has led to very “free” (so Old) tr. of the word and interpr. of the syntax (e.g., Ge “Durch seine Stärke macht Indra ein Gegengewicht unmöglich”; Re is even freer), where “(macht) unmöglich” for akalpá- seems distinctly odd and the syntactic relation between it and pratimā́nam is loose at best. The difficulties disappear if we instead read loc. akalpé.

As Old points out, by accent the word should be a bahuvrīhi. The one example of kálpa- in the RV seems to refer to arrangements, ritual or martial (IX.9.7: ávā kálpeṣu naḥ pumas, támāṃsi soma yódhyā “help us in our arrangements, o male; the shades of darkness must be fought”), and a bahuvrīhi “without arrangement/order” modifying an underlying ‘battle’-word (perhaps khaja- ‘tumult’ extracted from immediately preceding khajaṃkaráḥ) makes perfect sense in context.

This leaves an equational sentence índraḥ … pratimā́nam ójasā “by his strength Indra is the match,” and we need only supply the specification of what he is the match for. I sc. ‘all’ on the basis of II.12.9c, also describing Indra: yó víśvasya pratimā́nam babhūva. However, esp. in conjunction with 8ab, it might instead be the earth, or heaven and earth. Cf. I.52.13 (also of Indra) tvám bhuvaḥ pratimā́nam pṛthivyā́ḥ (also 12); X.111.5 índro diváḥ pratimā́nam pṛthivyā́ḥ.
