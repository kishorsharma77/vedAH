Indra
Savya Āṅgirasa
11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 6, 8, 9, 11
Etymological figures and lexical repetitions abound in this hymn, and through  this repetition Indra comes to “own” certain words—particularly “daring” and  “sovereignty.” Much of the hymn (esp. vss. 1–6) consists of praise of Indra’s vari ous violent deeds, interspersed with exhortations to sing these praises to the god.  In verse 7 the earthly king is invested with some of Indra’s prestige—as long as he  emulates Indra’s habit of command and also shows the Indraic quality of generos ity to the poets. This generosity is also urged on Indra himself in verses 8–9 and  11, with a curious and obscurely phrased treatment of the Vr̥tra myth interspersed  in verse 10.
