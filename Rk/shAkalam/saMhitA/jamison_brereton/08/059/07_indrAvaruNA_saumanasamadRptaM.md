Indra and Varuṇa, establish undistracted benevolence and thriving of  wealth among the sacrificers.
Establish offspring, prosperity, and development among us. Lengthen  our lifetime for long life.
The grouping of the VIIIth Maṇḍala hymns that follow the Vālakhilya hymns (60– 103) is not as clear as in the earlier section of the maṇḍala, in great part because  the poets are far less likely to identify themselves. Nonetheless, the order of deities  and the number of verses per hymn provide good evidence. We follow Oldenberg’s  (1888: 216–18) proposed structure.
The next collection of hymns (VIII.60–66) is ascribed to Pragātha and several of  his sons. All but the first are dedicated to Indra.
