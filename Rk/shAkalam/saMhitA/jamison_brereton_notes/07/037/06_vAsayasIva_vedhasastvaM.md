The trans.-/caus. vāsáyasi is here used in a curious idiomatic sense. The other two occurrences of this stem, nearby each other in III.1.17, 7.3, are straightforward in function: ‘cause to dwell / settle down’. But here the verb is used in a complaint: ‘cause to wait, cool one’s heels, hang around, bide one’s time’. The idiom is reinforced by the very rare use of the simile particle iva with a verb. My “seem to be …” is meant to capture this iva; it could also be rendered ‘as it were’. Ge (n. 6) suggests that this is a hint to the poet’s patron that he (the poet) has been waiting too long for his dakṣiṇā.

The adj. tātyá- is a transparent deriv. of the familiar word for father, tatá- ‘daddy, papa’. I therefore think the rather formal register of Ge’s väterlich and Re’s paternel strike the wrong note; surely the idea is that Indra’s dhī́- is affectionate and indulgent.
