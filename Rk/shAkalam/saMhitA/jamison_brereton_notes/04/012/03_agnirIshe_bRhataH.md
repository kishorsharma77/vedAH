Assuming (as I do) that Thieme and Hoffmann are correct in their assessment of √vidh ‘honor, serve’ as a secondary root derived from ví √dhā ‘apportion’ (for reff. see EWA s.v. VIDH), the second half-vs. encapsulates an etymological pun: #dádhāti … vidhaté …, #ví ... This casts considerable doubt on Bloomfield’s (RR, ad loc.) characteristically acerbic judgment “The preposition ví which limps, with sharp tmesis, behind its verb dádhāti …. impresses me as secondary.” Furthermore, the positioning of ví directly before ānuṣák ‘in due order’ is found elsewhere (cf. I.72.7, VI.5.3). In such phrases the ví presumably emphasizes that goods are apportioned to each deserving recipient separately and in order.
