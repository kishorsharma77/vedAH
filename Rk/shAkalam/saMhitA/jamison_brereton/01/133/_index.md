Indra
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
7 verses: triṣṭubh 1, anuṣṭubh 2–4, gāyatrī 5, dhr̥ti [atyaṣṭi] 6, atyaṣṭi 7
This metrically complex hymn is the last one in the Paruchepa Indra cycle and is  longer by one verse than the preceding hymn (I.132). It also falls naturally into  two parts on the grounds of meter, subject matter, and diction: verses 1–5, which  are mostly in dimeter meter and have an Atharvan cast, and verses 6–7 in atyaṣṭi  (or modified atyaṣṭi) meter, which more nearly resembles the atyaṣṭi hymns ear
lier in the cycle. As Oldenberg already saw, we can thus analyze it as two hymns,  of five and two verses respectively, which then conform to the usual patterns of  arrangement.
The first hymn contains a number of odd formations, whose meaning and ety mology are unclear; our renderings are provisional. Despite these uncertainties, we  can happily grasp the gusto with which the poet urges Indra to destroy troops of  witches and other demonic beings.
The second short hymn also enthusiastically rouses Indra against enemies, but in  a style more recognizably R̥gvedic, and it situates the action in the interplay between  the soma-pressing sacrificer and Indra, the recipient of the soma and the sacrifice.
