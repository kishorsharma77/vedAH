Soma Pavamāna
Medhyātithi Kāṇva
6 verses: gāyatrī
In this last hymn attributed to Medhyātithi, he is at particular pains to draw atten tion to the importance of the poet’s role in the preparation of the soma. Not only  does he name himself in verse 3, but the first three verses emphasize the clothing  (vs. 1), beautification (vs. 2), and adornment (vs. 3) of Soma with hymns. In the  final verse (6) he asks for a proper recompense for the poet (that is, himself) who  produces these hymns.
## 1
The one who is groomed like a steed with cows [=milk], for exhilaration,  the delightful one—
him do we clothe with hymns.
## 2
Him do all our hymns, seeking aid, beautify in the ancient way—
the drop for Indra to drink.
## 3
While being purified, he makes his journey—the delightful Soma,  adorned with the hymns
of the inspired poet Medhyātithi.
## 4
Self-purifying Soma, for us find very beautiful wealth
of a thousand lusters, o drop.
## 5
The drop, like a steed running for the prize, keeps neighing in the filter, when he has overflowed it, in search of the gods.
## 6
Purify yourself for prizewinning, for the strengthening of the inspired  poet who hymns you.
Soma, give us an abundance of heroes.
