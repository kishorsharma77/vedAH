As should be clear from the immed. preceding discussion, as elsewhere in IX I take dhā́māni ‘domains’ as referring to the filter and subsequent locales that the soma traverses, not, with Ge, Soma’s forms. (What Re means by “structures” is uninterpretable to me.) The physical locations on the ritual ground can also be viewed as the cosmic domains over which Soma has dominion - hence the hyperbolic statement in d, attributing universal rule to Soma.

On víśvasya bhúvanasya rājasi, see the identical phrase in 28b.

vyānaśí- belongs with the redupl. -í-stem type of cakrí-, etc. (cf. weak pf. vyā̀naś- to √(n)aś); see AiG II.2.292. It can therefore govern the acc., like other instances of this formation type, and we can easily supply dhā́māni from pāda a, strongly supported by the parallel later in the hymn: IX.86.15 yó asya dhā́ma prathamáṃ vyānaśe “who has reached through his first domain,” with the medial perfect to ví √(n)aś.
