Ge takes the participles in b (sī́dan … punānáḥ) as implicitly predicated (“er läutert sich und setzt sich …”), but there seems no reason to do so. They are surely parallel to the part. in pāda a (sṛjyámānaḥ) and detail the various circumstances under which Soma keeps roaring.

The verb in b, 3rd sg. mid. janayata, seems to be a true middle with selfinvolvement of the subj. -- “he generates (his own) thoughts through his own powers.” - not dependent on the purely formal 3rd pl. -anta replacement janáyanta (see my “Voice fluctuation in the Rig Veda: Medial 3rd plural -anta in active paradigms,” IIJ 21 ([1979] 146-69). The self-involvement of the subj. is even clearer in the near-twin passage I.95.4 vatsó mātṝ́r janayata svadhā́bhiḥ “ The calf [=Agni] begets his (own) mothers with his own powers.” See comm. ad loc.
