On the lexeme yújyāya √vṝ see comm. ad IX.88.1.

The expression naíváthā (that is, ná eváthā), placed between the two instrumentals, is opaque: eváthā is a hapax. Old helpfully adduces IV.30.1 nákir indra tvád úttaraḥ .. .nákir evā́yáthā tvám “There is no one higher than you, Indra … no one who is exactly as you are,” and our eváthā appears almost to be a blend of evā́ yáthā or some abbreviation thereof.
