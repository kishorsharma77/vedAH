The ritual and/or real world situation depicted in pādas a and c is unclear. In particular, in pāda a what plants does soma (+ milk) pour onto? Ober (II.42) may well be right that it depicts soma as rain, though we would still lack a ritual analogue to the plants receiving rain in the real world. Rain in this pāda would fit with the lightning imagery in c. Soma him/itself flashed forth (ví didyute) in IX.80.1, and “ever-flashing light” (dávidyutatī- rúc-) is associated with the soma drinks in IX.64.28.

The publ. tr. construed dhā́rayā with sutáḥ, because this expression (IX.51.5, 72.5, 100.6, 108.5) or minor variants (IX.3.10=42.2, 10.4, 97.45) are fairly common in this maṇḍala. However, both Ge and Re take it with pavate, parallel with vidyútā (e.g., “Der ausgepresste Soma laütert sich mit Blitz (und Regen)guss”), and this may be preferable in the rainstorm context.
