Ge follows Sāy. in interpr. this vs. as referring to rain and river waters.

Although this would accord better with the enigmatic gush (dhāsí-) of 6d, it doesn’t fit the vocabulary or apparent sense of this enigmatic vs. The best clue we have is pāda a, where “to fill the belly” (jaṭháram pṛṇádhyai) belongs to a phrase for drinking soma to satiation (cf. nearby VI.69.7 and V.34.2, X.104.2, as well as other locutions involving soma and the belly). (Both Old and Re also take the pāda as referring to soma.) Once the poet has established the soma context with this reasonably clear phraseology, he can (and does) treat the subject in a more obscure fashion.

In b and c I take the feminine plurals sábhṛtayaḥ ‘of the same rearing / pedigree’ and yuvatáyò ’vātāḥ ‘unsurpassable maidens’ as referring to the fingers (of the priests) that press the soma. Such locutions, referring to the shared kinship of the fingers (because they belong to the same hand), are frequent in the IXth Maṇḍala and the forms are always feminine. I am tolerably certain of the second identification, since the action ascribed to them in pāda d, distributing their “milk,” would be a reasonable way (given the tropes of soma preparation) to characterize the work of the pressing fingers. I am less certain about the identification in b, because “fill the seat” (sádma … pṛṇánti) is not as easy to connect with soma preparation. “Seat” could refer, inter alia, to the ritual ground or the cosmos -- both are attested -- but neither is generally flooded with soma. sábhṛti- is a hapax, so it does not help identify the referent. So the sense of pāda b remains in doubt for me.

Note another ex. of a -dhyai infinitive, though this time not as the predicated substitute for a main verb.
