I take the phrase suṣavyáḥ sudákṣiṇaḥ as referring to Indra’s two horses, since it follows immediately on a hemistich (4cd) concerning those horses and his chariot. But ‘sides’ or ‘hands’ are also possible. Ge simply fails to supply a referent (“Der eine gute Linke, eine gute Rechte hat”). I.82.5 yuktás te astu dákṣiṇa utá savyáḥ ... supports my interpretation as horses.
