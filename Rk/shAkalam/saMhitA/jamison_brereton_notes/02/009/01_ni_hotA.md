vídāna- is ambiguous: it can belong either to √vid ‘know’ (Ge [/WG], Re, though he registers the ambiguity in n.) or √vid ‘find’ (Old [SBE]). I assign it to the latter and think it refers to the myth of the discovery and recovery of the fugitive Agni. The word forms a weak ring with suvidátra- in the final vs., 6a, assuming the latter word is a derivative of √vid; see comm. ad vs. 6.

ádabdhavratapramati- is an unusual cmpd for the RV in having three members, and with its initial accent (on which see AiG II.1.293) the accent falls about as far from word-end as it is possible to be.
