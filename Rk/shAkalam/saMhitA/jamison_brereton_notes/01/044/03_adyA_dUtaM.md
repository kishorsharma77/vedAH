My interpretation of bhā́ṛjīka- I owe to Thieme (Unters. 40 n. 2; see EWA s.v. ṛjīka-).

adhvaraśrī́-. Pace Gr, Old (SBE) Ge (/WG), I very much doubt that -śrī́- in this compound (or others) has transitive value: ‘das Opferfest verschönend’. For extensive disc. see Scar (545-46), who lays out a number of interpretive possibilities but seems to lean towards the one I also favor. (So also Re.) Related to the analysis of this compound is the interpretation of yajñā́nām adhvara-. Ge (WG) take the former as dependent on the latter (clearest in WG “der die Opferhandlungen der Opfer verschönt”), but I think it more likely that the two nouns are parallel and depend on -śrī́-, one as an independent gen., one as 1st compound member. So Re.; Scar adduces VIII.44.7 adhvarā́ṇām abhiśríyam, with an independent gen. of adhvará-, which supports this analysis.
