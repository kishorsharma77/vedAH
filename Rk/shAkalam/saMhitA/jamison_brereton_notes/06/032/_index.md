Indra As noted in the publ. intro., the first vs. is a meta-verse in which the poet refers to his own just-composed praise; the remaining vss. constitute that praise, and all begin with the prn. sá, a stylistic repetition that unifies and defines the praisehymn proper. It is noteworthy that, although the vocabulary and rhetoric leave no doubt of the identity of the recipient of the praise, the name “Indra” is not mentioned until the last vs. (5b) and the word “god” not at all. In this connection note the unaccented dat. asmai ‘for him’ in the first pāda of the hymn. Such unaccented oblique pronominal forms assume a referent already in the discourse, so Indra is present from the beginning despite not being named or even referred to at this point in the hymn, and the dative descriptors that follow in this vs., particularly vajríṇe ‘possessing the mace’ in c, simply reinforce the audience’s recognition.
