Agni
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
11 verses: anuṣṭubh, except śakvarī 11
In its first half (vss. 1–5) this hymn echoes the themes of VI.1: Agni as the joint con cern of all the separate units of Ārya society (and indeed of the gods as well) and  the success that attends the man who fulfills his ritual responsibilities to Agni. The  hymn ends the same way (vss. 10–11), with special mention of Agni’s position in the  individual house as well as his role as clanlord. The similarity between beginning  and ending is marked by a signal of ring composition: the god Mitra compared to  Agni in both the first and last verses. Agni is often compared with or identified with  Mitra (“Ally, Alliance”) because of his position on earth as guest and helper of  men, though himself a god, and because, as god, he mediates the sacrificial alliance  between gods and men.
By contrast, the verses in between (6–9) offer a sequence of increasingly dense  and complex images of fire, starting with a simple one of whirling smoke and sun like brightness (vs. 6), but the comparisons in verses 7cd–8 rely on multiple puns  and terse and elliptical phraseology. This middle section sets the stage for the rest  of the Agni cycle with its focus on the physical aspects of fire.
