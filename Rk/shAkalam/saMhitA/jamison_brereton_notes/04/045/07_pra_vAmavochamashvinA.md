This final vs. in part reprises vs. 1: ráthaḥ begins both b pādas, and párijmā ‘earth-encircling’ of 1b is paraphrased by 7c yéna sadyáḥ pári rájāṃsi yātháḥ “with which in a day you drive around the dusky realms” -- though -jman- and rájas- are of course unrelated, there is some phonological similarity. Given this ringcompositional effect between vss. 1 and 7, it is barely possible that we should supply dhíyam from cmpd dhiyaṃdhā́- in 7b as obj. to úd iyarti in 1a (see disc. there).
