With Ge (/WG) I take the two as the Hotar and Adhvaryu priests, with pāda a appropriate to the former and b to the latter. Although it is something of a surprise to find the charged word mithunā́, which is usually used of a sexual pairing, applied to two males, it is presumably because the two priests have complementary duties. I do not think that it refers to the sacrificer and his wife, contra Old (flg. Benfey). As I have argued at length elsewhere (Jamison 2011, 2016 [UTexas Vedic conf.], and forthcoming [World Skt. Conf. Edinburgh]), I consider the ritual Patnī to be a ritual role introduced only in the late RV and very controversial at that time, and I doubt that she would be so casually alluded to here.
