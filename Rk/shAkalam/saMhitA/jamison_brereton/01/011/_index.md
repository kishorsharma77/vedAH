Indra  
Jetar Mādhuchandasa  
8 verses: anuṣṭubh  
Attributed to a descendant of Madhuchandas, the poet of I.1–10, this relatively  simple hymn has little distinctive about it. Several famous deeds of Indra are men tioned (Vala verse 5, Śuṣṇa verse 7), and our praises and Indra’s countergifts are  celebrated. These general themes are similar to those found in the Indra hymns of  the ancestral Madhuchandas.  
The poet is fond of etymological figures: “best charioteer of charioteers” (1c),  “the conqueror who is not to be conquered” (2d), “with your tricks...the tricky...”  (7a), and the probably etymologically unrelated but phonologically similar máṃhate  maghám “grants the bounty” (3d).
