I take váriṣṭhā as a likely pun, not only ‘widest’ (hence a throat that can accommodate a lot of soma at one gulp), but also ‘best’; cf. disc. ad VI.37.4.

For prá √sthā with soma as expressed or implied obj., cf. I.15.9, VII.92.2, and, with prásthitam, II.36.4, 37.2.

I do not know the exact semantic nuance of sám √vṛt, but I think it must mean something more than Ge’s “mitkommen.” I take it here as purposive ‘turn oneself to’, with gavyúḥ expressing the purpose, but this may be pushing the idiom.
