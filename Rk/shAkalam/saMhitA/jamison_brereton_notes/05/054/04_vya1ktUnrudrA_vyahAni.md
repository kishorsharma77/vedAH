The vs. sets up pairs of antitheses: nights/days (a), midspace/dusky realms (b), with the third only indirectly implied: fields [=dry land]/ *water [via boats] (c).

The īm that interrupts the simile nā́vaḥ … yathā in c is superficially puzzling, but I think it is related to the implication just noted: it stands for the acc. ‘waters’ in the full realization of the phrase “like boats (through waters).” It is also worthy of note that the cadences of pādas c and d are phonologically similar, esp. at beginning and end, though they achieve this through very different grammatical means: … nā́va īṃ yathā # … nā́ha riṣyatha #.
