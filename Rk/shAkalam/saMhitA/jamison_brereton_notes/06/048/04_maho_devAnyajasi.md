Pāda a juxtaposes two 2nd sg. forms of √yaj, the indic. pres. yájasi and the - si-impv. yákṣi, in separate clauses. This juxtaposition presumably accounts for the accent on yájasi.

In d the obj. must be vā́jā, extracted from vā́jotá. Grammatically this should be a dual, but a dual is semantically unlikely (Old “Dual vā́jā ist gewiss nicht anzunehmen”). Best to take it as a pseudo-/nonce neut. pl. For the phrase cf. (as Ge does) I.48.11 vā́jaṃ hí váṃsva; on this basis it is likely that vā́jā is obj. of both rā́sva and váṃsva, although the position of utá associates it esp. with rā́sva.
