Indra (1–20), Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇa’s Dānastuti  (21–24)  
Medhyātithi Kāṇva  
24 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, 1–20, arranged in pragāthas, anuṣṭubh  12, gāyatrī 22–23, br̥hatī 24  
Like the previous two hymns, this one consists of a long praise of Indra (vss. 1–20)  followed by a short dānastuti (21–24). The Indra portion is arranged in stan dard pragāthas, while the dānastuti is metrically more varied. The verse pairs of  the pragāthas are for the most part internally unified, but like many of the longer  hymns in VIII there is not much apparent structure in the hymn as a whole. There  are, however, several recurrent themes:  the greatness (mahimán) and vast power  (śávas) of Indra (e.g., vss. 4, 6); the gods and poets who have previously celebrated  Indra and have been helped by him (e.g., vss. 7–9, 16); and the sheer noise made  by Indra’s praisers (e.g., vss. 3, 7, 16, 18). In the context of all this previous poetic  activity, verses 13 and 14 raise anxious questions about what constitutes the proper  topic of praise poetry and how to configure these praises anew, the perennial prob  
lem of the R̥gvedic bard.  
The dānastuti is far easier to interpret than those of the previous two  hymns: the patron Pākasthāman is celebrated for his gift of a particularly fine  sorrel horse, given also by Indra and the Maruts. The first half of the last verse  (24) seems to contain an adage, or adapted piece of folk wisdom, as a foil to  further praise of the patron in the second half of the verse. The verse itself has  a slight Pindaric ring.
