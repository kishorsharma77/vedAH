Soma Pavamāna
Ambarīṣa Vārṣāgira and R̥jiśvan Bhāradvāja
12 verses: anuṣṭubh, except br̥hatī 11
The themes that dominate this hymn are standard soma tropes. The normal stages  in the preparation of the soma are treated (see esp. vss. 2–3, 6–10), and the poet  regularly reminds Soma of the gifts he should bring to his mortal preparers (see esp.  vss. 1, 4–5, 12). Indeed the hymn begins and ends with an appeal for vā́ja “prizes”  (vss. 1a, 12cd), in a sort of ring composition.
However, although the sentiments expressed and descriptions provided are unre markable, the hymn is characterized by very choppy and sometimes incoherent syn tax (which for purposes of translation has been cleaned up somewhat). Since there  are also metrical disturbances in the hymn, one wonders if it has been transmitted  entirely correctly.
