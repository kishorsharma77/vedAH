Indra and Bṛhaspati As disc. in the publ. intro., this hymn seems to be modeled on the Indra/Vāyu hymns just preceding, esp. since in standard śrauta ritual there is no joint offering of soma to Indra and Bṛhaspati. Like Indra and Vāyu in IV.46.3-7, Indra and Bṛhaspati are consistently addressed with a dual dvandva, índrābṛ́haspátī, which is found only here. (Note the correct dual 1st member índrā, in contrast to índra-vāyū discussed ad IV.46.2.) This dvandva is found as an unaccented voc. in every vs., save for 5, where the fully accented form occurs as an acc. In addition, in 3b there is a headless Vāyav Indraś ca construction, índraś ca, lacking the voc. *bṛ́haspate -- though the preceding pāda does contain voc. indrābṛhaspatī. See further below.
