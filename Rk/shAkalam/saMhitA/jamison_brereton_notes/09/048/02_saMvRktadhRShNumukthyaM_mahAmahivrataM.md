This vs. is couched in the acc. and entirely dependent on vs. 1, qualifying Soma.

Contra Gr, the cmpd sáṃvṛkta-dhṛṣṇu- must be a bahuvrīhi; cf. esp. Old and Scar (504).

The cmpd mahā́mahivrata- is unusual in having three members, esp. since the first two are etym. identical. With AiG II.1.236 it’s best to take mahā́as ‘very’ (cf. also Schmidt, vrata p. 100).

There is somewhat stronger evidence for a Somaraub connection in this vs. than in vs. 1. In particular Soma is said to be “eager to break a hundred strongholds” (śatám púro rurukṣáṇim); in IV.27.1 these same (or similar) strongholds guarded him (śatám mā púra ā́yasīr arakṣan) before he was rescued, and so he would be eager to break out of them. Note the phonological similarity between arakṣan and rurukṣáṇim; the latter is a hapax, with in fact no other desid. forms built to the root √ruj elsewhere in Skt., so the echo may have been deliberately constructed.

If pāda c refers to Soma’s desire to break out of confinement, it’s possible that sáṃvṛkta-dhṛṣṇu- also refers to this confinement: ‘having his bold(ness) encoiled’, with dhrṣṇu a quality of Soma - rather than my original interpr., that Soma had encoiled the dhṛṣṇú- of another. Note that Soma is qualifed by dhṛṣṇú- in the immediately preceding hymn (IX.47.2). The use of the idiom sáṃvṛkta- ‘encoiled, encircled’ could reflect the circular fortresses.

A connection between the 100 strongholds in this vs. and the explicit Somaraub allusion in the next vs. was suggested by Hilldebrandt, but unfortunately rejected by Old— too fastidiously I think.
