Despite the distance between them and the syntagms in between, I take rāyā́ and ūtī́as parallel polarized instr. to be construed primarily with gántā. Ge and WG differently, though also differently from each other.

It is tempting to interpr gántā in d as a periphrastic future, a temptation yielded to in the publ. tr.
