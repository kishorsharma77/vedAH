This vs. has produced more consternation than it deserves, because of the reluctance of many interpr. to allow yéṣām to be coreferential with the subj. of vibhrā́jante. In these interpr., if the subj. of that verb is the Maruts, then another referent for yéṣām must be found; if yéṣām refers to the Maruts, then another subj. of the verb must be found. See Old’s lengthy disc., which includes the differing suggestions of numerous scholars (incl. also interpr. yéṣām as *yé eṣām) but doesn’t reach firm conclusions. Of modern interpr., Re takes yéṣām as the Maruts and makes ródasī the subj. of the verb: “les Deux Mondes brillent au loin”; in a fractured sense this goes back to Max Müller’s tr. in SBE 32, but Müller emended the verb to

*bhrā́jate and took ródasī as sg., whereas Re mentions no such emendation and
seems to be taking ródasī as dual, which will certainly not work grammatically with a pl. verb. WG seem to have accepted the *yé eṣām interpr. Ge, surprisingly, is more relaxed and allows coreference under the rubric of “der reflexive Gebrauch des Relativs,” which seems perfectly plausible to me: they flash with their own splendour.

The “bright ornament” of c is the sun: rukmá- is so used elsewhere in clearer context (VI.51.1, VII.63.4).
