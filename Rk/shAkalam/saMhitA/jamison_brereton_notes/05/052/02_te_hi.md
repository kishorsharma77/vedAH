It is not clear why the rel. cl. of ab contains sánti, as the clause seems a simple equational one (“since they are comrades”), and such clauses generally lack an overt copula. Ge takes dhṛṣṇuyā́as a predication with sánti, as, it seems, do WG.

This is in principle appealing, but given that we get untethered adv. dhṛṣnuyā́in the previous and following vss. (1a, 4b) and a similar equational (rel.) cl. in 13ab (yé … kaváyaḥ sánti “who are poets,” it does not seem compelling.

Ge takes dhṛṣadvínaḥ as acc. pl. with śáśvataḥ, but he seems isolated in this interpr., starting from Sāy., who takes it as the nom. pl. that otherwise universally prevails.
