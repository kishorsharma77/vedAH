Most tr. take ā́paḥ as acc. here (“I have followed the waters.”). This is of course possible: the nom. of this stem does get used for acc. occasionally in the RV.

However, such an interpr. is not nec. in this case, since it is easy to supply an acc. “you.” And the fact that the two previous vss. (21a and 22a) contain vocatives ā́paḥ and āpaḥ respectively supports a vocative interpretation here.
