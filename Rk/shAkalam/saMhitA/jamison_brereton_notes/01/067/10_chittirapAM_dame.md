The exact sense of cittí- and the syntactic disposition of apā́m are the two issues in this verse. Although cittí- ordinarily means ‘perception, insight’ and most tr.

so take it, I prefer to make it the abstract to a different, but well-represented, sense of √cit, namely ‘appears’, hence ‘apparition’. I also, with Old SBE, take apā́m with dáme rather than cittíḥ. I find tr. like “la pensée active des eaux” (Re), “der Verstand der Wasser” (WG) hard to interpret, indeed even lacking sense. Since much of the hymn has dealt with the theme of Agni’s hiding - and since his hiding place was the waters, though this was not overtly stated earlier - I think that this verse describes him glowing in the waters (and therefore detectible) and also makes reference to him as Apām Napāt.

The sádma of c must be read with both simile and frame.
