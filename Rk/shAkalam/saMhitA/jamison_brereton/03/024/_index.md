Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
5 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 1
This is a brief, almost staccato hymn. Every verse begins with an invocation to  Agni, and most verses follow with an imperative, urging Agni to take his place on  the ritual ground and to grant the wishes of the poet and his people. The first three  verses refer either directly or indirectly to the brightening fire, which may find its  counterpart in the swiftness and brevity of the hymn.
