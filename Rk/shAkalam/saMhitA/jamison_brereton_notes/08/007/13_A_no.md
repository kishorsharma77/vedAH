I take madacyútam as having “active” meaning (‘arousing exhilaration’), rather than passive. Scar (126) allows either for this stem, and Re takes it as passive here. Since the passive form mádacyutam built with the past participle would fit the same metrical slot, I think that the active sense must be meant.
