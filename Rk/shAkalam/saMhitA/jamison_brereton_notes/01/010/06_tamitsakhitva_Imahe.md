The case usage here is somewhat odd, in that the three benefits we beg Indra for, in strict parallel structure, are in loc., dat., and loc. respectively (underlying forms sakhitvé … rāyé … suvī́rye). However, all end in -e — showing that surface phonetic agreement can sometimes trump case function.

The transformation of an epithet (śakrá- ‘able’) into its associated verb (śakat ‘he will be able’) is a neat little figure and demonstrates the importance of gods’ dynamically living up to their verbal attributes. (For the almost identical pāda see VIII.32.12.) It is an example of a type of verbal transformation of divine epithets into desired divine action that Elizarenkova (1968: 267-68) attempted to claim as the, or an, organizing principle of RVic hymnic composition., despite its relative rarity. Of the other standard translations, only Re (“… le puissant; qu’il exerce .. sa puissance”) captures the etymological figure.
