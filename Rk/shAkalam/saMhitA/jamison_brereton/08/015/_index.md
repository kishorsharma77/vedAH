Indra  
Goṣūktin Kāṇvāyana and Aśvasūktin Kāṇvāyana  
13 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in trcas, with a final verse ̥  
Attributed to the same poets as the preceding VIII.14, this hymn is a more conven tional praise hymn. It asserts the dominance of Indra over all the cosmos (esp. vss.  2–6), and conversely the contribution the cosmic entities and the various other gods  make to Indra’s power (vss. 7–10). The final tr̥ca (10–12), with its coda apparently  addressed to Soma (vs. 13), seeks to harness all Indra’s powers for victory for our  side, and thus echoes the poet’s opening charge to his comrades (vs. 1). The return  to the beginning is also signaled by a ring-compositional device: the first two pādas  of verse 11 are almost identical to those of verse 3 in the Sanskrit, though their  translations diverge somewhat.  
Both the language and the structure of this hymn are straightforward, but its  relatively simplicity avoids the banal by the deft balancing of the powers in the two  contrastive sections of the hymn and the unembellished grandeur of the rhetoric.
