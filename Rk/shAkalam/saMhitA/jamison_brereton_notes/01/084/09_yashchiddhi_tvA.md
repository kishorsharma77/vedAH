A broken construction. The subject of the 3rd ps. verb in c (patyate) must be Indra, though he is represented by 2nd ps. tvā in the apparent rel. cl. of ab. (The parallel in III.36.4b ugráṃ śávaḥ patyate dhṛṣṇv ójaḥ, where Indra is undeniably the subject, makes it clear that the mortal soma-presser of our ab cannot be the subject of patyate.) The yá- clause of ab thus has no direct grammatical connection with what ought to be its main clause in c, and I therefore take yáś cid as the functional equivalent of the indefinite káś cid.

I.84.10-12: See publ. intro. for the structure of this tṛca and its relation to I.80. The subjects of all three verses are feminine (gauryàḥ, yā́ḥ … sayā́varīḥ 10; tā́(ḥ) … pṛ́śnayaḥ, … dhenávaḥ 11; tā́(ḥ) 12; vásvīḥ 10-12), but, in my opinion, the hidden referent of all three verses is the Maruts. See also comm. on vs. 16.
