Pāda a contains two ambiguous forms: yā́n, which can be either acc. pl.

masc. of the rel. pronoun or pres. act. part., nom. sg. masc., to the root pres. of √yā ‘drive’; ávaḥ, which can be either the 2nd sg. injunc. act. of the them. pres. to √av ‘help’ or the acc. sg. neut. of ávas- ‘aid, help’. If we take yā́n as a rel. pron., there is the problem that there is no referent for it in the main clause (save for the Wind’s horses, which are not likely). Despite the majority of tr., I therefore take it as the participle, with the consequence that ávaḥ is a noun, serving as acc. of goal, rather than a finite verb. (Its accent would be a problem in a non-relative clause.) As it turns out, there are no injunctives to the thematic present of this root: we find either augm.

ā́vaḥ (etc.) or subj. ávāḥ (etc.); this is an additional, if weak, argument for not taking it as a finite verb.

The adj. mandínam ‘exhilarating’ in c seems semantically far enough from its apparent referent, vajrám in d, that Ge supplies a verb “(trink)” to produce a new clause and allow mandínam to qualify the expected soma (see the same adj. in 8c).

This is unnecessary. Uśanā Kāvya’s major job is to give Indra the mace (see also V.34.2) and for Indra to reach exhilaration in his company (I.51.11). In our passage it seems as if these are conflated, and the vajra itself is what provides the exhilaration (= the energy to kill Vṛtra bez. Śuṣṇa).
