The hapax āhutī-vṛ́dh- could be either passive (as in the publ. tr., also Ge) or act.

‘strengthening the oblation’ (Re). Scar (514) considers both possibilities and opts, weakly, for the former. Either could certainly work in context. The long final vowel -tī- is found only here, versus the standard ā́huti-. This can either be a metrical lengthening of the stem vowel, since *āhutĭ-vṛ́dham, with 3 (or actually 4) light syllables in a row, would produce an unacceptable cadence. Or it can be an instr. sg. to the -ti-stem (see inconclusive disc. in Scar.), which would clinch the interpr. of the cmpd as passive ‘strengthened by the oblation’. I weakly favor the latter.
