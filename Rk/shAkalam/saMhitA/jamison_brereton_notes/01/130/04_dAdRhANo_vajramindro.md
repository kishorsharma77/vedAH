In f the standard tr. take vanínaḥ as an acc. pl., the object of ní vṛścasi in the frame, parallel to acc. vṛksám in the simile. But after all the build-up earlier in the verse towards the smashing of Vṛtra, I find it hard to believe that Indra is just cutting down trees here, and the doubling of ‘tree’ in vṛkṣám vanínaḥ seems lame (“like a carpenter a tree, you cut down wooden things [=trees]”). Instead I take vanínaḥ as gen. sg. referring collectively to a forest (the thing that has wood) and supply Vṛtra / the serpent as object in the frame. Both vṛtrám and áhim are found elsewhere as obj.

of vṛśca- (though, I admit, not with ní, but usually with ví).
