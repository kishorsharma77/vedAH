In the publ. tr. I treat the first member of the three-member cmpd índratvotāḥ as if it were a voc., since the lit. “aided by you, Indra” seems clumsy.

The verb ádhi vocā could also be a 1st sg. subj., but with most tr. I take it as 2nd sg. impv.; “I” am a less likely advocate for the presser than Indra is.

With Ge I consider ví cayema bháre kṛtám (f) a gambling expression; for another such expression see the previous hymn, I.131.5d.
