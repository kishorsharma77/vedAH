Waters
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
4 verses: triṣṭubh
The waters are celebrated here primarily in their ritual employment, in the prepara tion of soma—though soma itself is not explicitly mentioned. These waters come to  be replaced by the rivers in the last two verses (3–4), but their physical characteris tics are not mentioned either. However, the final pāda before the refrain (4c) alludes  to the rivers’ making “wide space” for us, quite possibly an allusion to the enlarging  of the Ārya territory by crossing and conquering rivers.
## 1
O Waters, your wave of refreshments that those devoted to the gods  made Indra’s first drink—
it, gleaming and unbesmirched, showering ghee and filled with honey,  might we win today.
## 2
That wave of yours, o Waters, most filled with honey—let the Child of  the Waters who impels swift (horses) help it.
That on which Indra, along with the Vasus, will bring himself to
exhilaration, that one of yours might we, seeking the gods, attain today. 3. Possessing a hundred filters, delighting in their independent power, the  goddesses [=Waters] merge into the fold of the gods.
They do not confound the commandments of Indra. To the rivers pour  an oblation filled with ghee.
## 4
Toward whom the sun has stretched out with its rays, for whom Indra  has dug out a way, a wave,
do you, o Rivers, provide wide space for us. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.
