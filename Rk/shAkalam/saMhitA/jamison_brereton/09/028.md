Soma Pavamāna
Priyamedha Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Attributed to another Āṅgirasa, whose given name is similar to the poet of the last  hymn (IX.27), this follows the same pattern, with initial “he, that one” (eṣá) opening  every verse. Otherwise it is constructed of the usual clichés, though the rhetoric is  nicely balanced.
## 1
This one, the prizewinner propelled by men, all-knowing as the lord  of mind,
runs through the sheep’s fleece.
## 2
This one has flowed into the filter, the soma pressed for the gods,
entering all their domains.
## 3
This one, an immortal god, beautifies himself in his womb,
the smasher of obstacles, best pursuer of the gods.
## 4
This one, the ever-roaring bull, held by the ten siblings [=fingers],
runs to the wooden cups.
## 5
This one, self-purifying, boundless, made the sun shine,
as the all-knowing one (knowing) all the domains.
## 6
This one, tempestuous, undeceivable Soma, rushes while being purified, pursuing the gods, smashing those who utter evil.
