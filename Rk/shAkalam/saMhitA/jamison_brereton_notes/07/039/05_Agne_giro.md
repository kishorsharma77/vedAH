In the first hemistich Agni appears to be playing on both sides, as it were: he is commanded (voc. agne) to bring (ā́… vaha) a series of gods here, including 64 Agni (acc. agním) at the end of pāda b. This seems conceptually odd: Agni the god does not need to be brought to the sacrifice -- he’s already there -- and it is also hard to see how he would bring himself. Ge’s (n. 5b) explanation that including Agni in the list serves for “Vervollständigung der Götterversammlung” seems weak. In that case we might expect Agni to come at the end of the list, and in any case too many gods are missing fom the list to consider it a complete collection. It might be possible to consider the Agni to be brought as the celestial Agni, i.e., the sun. But I think it more likely that agním is parallel to gíraḥ in pāda a, and both are acc. of goal, expressing the ritual elements the gods will encounter at the ritual: hymns and the ritual fire. The standard tr. take gíraḥ in this way, and I see no reason why agním can’t have the same function.

In c eṣām is hard to construe. I follow Old in accepting the BR emendation to

*eṣám ‘quick’. Old cites the parallel in the very next hymn VII.40.5 víṣṇor eṣásya.

As Old points out, the corruption can have arisen on the basis of likewise pāda-final eṣām in 2a. There are of course no metrical consequences. The emendation was not explicitly signaled in the publ. tr., which should read “… Viṣṇu, *the quick.” Neither Ge nor Re accepts (or even takes note of) this emendation.
