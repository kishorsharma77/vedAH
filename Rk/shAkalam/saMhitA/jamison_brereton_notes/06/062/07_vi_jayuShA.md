In d I take íti as a summarizing device, indicating that the three exploits sketched in abc are examples of the Aśvins’ sumatí-. With Ge I see no choice but to supply a verb like ‘you showed’ to govern the acc. sumatím.

As is clear to all, cyávānā is at the least a play on the name Cyavāna (same accent), another client of the Aśvins.
