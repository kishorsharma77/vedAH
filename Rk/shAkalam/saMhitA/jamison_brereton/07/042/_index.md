All Gods
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
Like VII.39, this hymn concerns the dawn soma sacrifice and especially Agni’s role  in it. The hymn begins with a verse expressing the readiness of all the ritual ele ments. Then Agni takes over and provides the impetus, hitching up his flames in  verse 2, and, as he gets larger, performing the sacrifice (vss. 3, 5). In verse 4 Agni  (identified as a guest, as often) is asked for the reward that is the expected return  for a successful sacrifice. The final verse (6) is a typical summary verse and names  Vasiṣṭha as the poet, as in another summary verse in this series (VII.39.7=40.7).  Although this is an All God hymn, the participation of named gods other than  Agni is limited to verse 5, where they are the simply the recipients of the sacrifice.  The mention of Aṅgirases in verse 1 is probably meant as a reference to the poet  and the other priests.
