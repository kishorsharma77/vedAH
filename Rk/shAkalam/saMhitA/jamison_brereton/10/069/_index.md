Agni
Sumitra Vādhryaśva
12 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1–2
This hymn is discussed at length and translated in full by Proferes (2007: 40–44),  who calls it “perhaps the clearest example of a tribal fire and the ritual role of the  clans in relation to this fire. It illustrates the existence of a central fire tended by  multiple clans who affirm through it their mutual solidarity, and who see in it the  source of their domination over others” (p.  40). This particular clan-fire is that  of King Vadhryaśva (see vss. 1–2, 4, 10–12), a speaking name with a deprecatory  sense: “possessing gelded horses,” and in fact the fire itself bears the patronymic  “son/descendant of Vadhryaśva” (see vss. 5, 9, 12). The current fire is also con trasted with fire or fires kindled previously (vss. 4–5), and toward the end of the hymn this fire present here is depicted as victorious over former fires, presumably  belonging to other clans (vss. 10–11). Such victories are just an aspect of the victo ries over other peoples that the clan-fire brings Vadhryaśva and his allies, the men  who kindle and tend this fire (vss. 5–6, 9–12).
One curious detail in the hymn is found in verse 7, where various possessions are  ascribed to the fire (here called a craftsman), including “a thousand barren cows.”  The negative connotations of this property are immediately counteracted in the  next verse (8ab), in which the fire is credited with having an abundantly fertile cow  whose flow of milk is inexhaustible, but the great flock of barren cows is nonethe
less odd. It finds its explanation in a semantic pun: just as the triumphant and suc cessful Vadhryaśva bears the name “possessing gelded horses” so does his equally  triumphant and successful fire “possess barren cows.”
Stylistically there is much chaining of phraseology and repetition of syntactic  patterns.
