Indra  
Nr̥medha  Āṅgirasa  
8 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas  
As often, an invitation to the soma sacrifice begins the hymn (vss. 1–2), but it then  continues directly to the topic of Indra’s giving (vss. 3–4), which often ends hymns.  The poet expresses his hope for goods somewhat indirectly, in a curious simile about  

getting cooked in the sun (vs. 3) and in the complex negative constructions of verse  4. The references to the same time yesterday (vs. 1) and to the apparent rebirth, that  is, the regular rising, of the sun (vs. 3) suggest that the setting is the dawn ritual,  when priestly gifts are distributed.  
The second half of the hymn (vss. 4–8) is the praise hymn proper, with emphasis  on Indra’s irresistible might in battle. The changes rung on the root tr̥̄ “overcome”  as well as the balanced oppositions (of the type “who X-es but is not X-ed”) and  parallelisms (e.g., the recurrence of -tar- agent nouns) give this portion of the hymn  a high rhetorical polish.
