In b yád can be the neut. sg. acc. object of ágrabhīt (so most tr.), rather than a subordinating ‘since’ as I take it. Either is possible, and there is little appreciable difference between them. If it is an acc. obj., we must supply a dummy obj. to pṛchati in the main clause: “he does not ask about (that) which he has grasped …” As in English (“… ask about what he has grasped …”) this dummy obj. can be easily gapped.

In d Ge, Re, WG take the subj. to be an unidentified other man (Re “(tout homme)”), not Agni, as Old and I do. The question in part rides on asyá. Those favoring a change of subject may have done so in part because they wished to avoid having asyá be coreferential with the subject. However, this is a non-issue: there are abundant exx. of such coreferential constructions; a reflexive pronominal/adjective isn’t required. On the other hand, they may be correct in this passage, in that b opens with an overt reflexive expression svéna … mánasā “with his own mind” marking Agni as subj. of the verb in that clause, and so asyá might be used contrastively, to mark the referent of the pronoun and the subject of sacate as different. On balance, though, I consider Agni still to be the subject, in part because the focus is so relentlessly on him otherwise.

I would, however, change the “resolve” of the publ. tr. to something more in keeping with the rest of the verse, perhaps “intellect, mental force.”
