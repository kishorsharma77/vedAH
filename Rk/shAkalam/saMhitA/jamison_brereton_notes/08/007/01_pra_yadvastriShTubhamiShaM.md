(Indra), a hymn that is also not in Triṣṭubh. Some remove the word here entirely from the poetic sphere, as in Macdonell’s “threefold Soma draught.” Ge believes that it can’t refer to the Triṣṭubh meter here, but that it must be a different technical term in recitation. I do not think that the fact that these two hymns are not in Triṣṭubh necessarily means that that meter can’t be referred to in this expression; there are, after all, plenty of hymns to both the Maruts and Indra in Triṣṭubh, and the verb governing the phrase is in the imperfect and therefore should refer to another occasion. But following Ge’s lead, I think it possible that ‘(having?) threefold rhythm’ could refer to the Gāyatrī meter in which this hymn is composed, since Gāyatrī consists of three pādas. Unfortunately this will not work for VIII.69, which is composed in a variety of meters (incl. Gāyatrī, but only vss. 4-6); the verse in which the phrase is found (VIII.69.1) is in Anuṣṭubh. I might emend the publ. tr. to “refreshment in threefold rhythm.” For further on the compound see Scar (641-42), who is somewhat indecisive about both the compound type and the sense.
