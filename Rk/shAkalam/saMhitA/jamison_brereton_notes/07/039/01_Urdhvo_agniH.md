The first pāda somewhat echoes the first hemistich of the preceding hymn (VII.38.1ab), with the final verb aśret mimicking likewise final áśiśret in 38.1b and the verb’s object sumatím resembling amátim in 38.1b and in the same metrical position. This is perhaps an additional reason to consider VII.38 to be fundamentally an All God hymn properly situated in the All God cycle, rather than an intrusive hymn to Savitar. See disc. in the publ. intro. to VII.38.

I do not know the referent of vásvaḥ. Perhaps, given the connections with VII.38.1, it is Savitar. The same phrase sumatím (…) vásvaḥ is found in III.4.1 (an Āprī hymn), but the referent is no clearer there. Ge suggests that the referent is Agni himself. This would work in both passages and may be correct; inter alia Agni is frequently the referent of vásu-, but the non-signalling of coreference with the subject still seems a little odd. The pl. vásavaḥ appears in vs. 3 modifying the gods.

On the idiom PATH √bhaj see comm. ad VII.18.16. 62 The publ. tr. fails to render naḥ in d. I would emend to “will offer our true (hymn)” or “will offer for us …” Both Ge and Re avoid making ṛtám obj. of yajāti, both by making it an adverbially used acc. of respect (vel sim.): “… möge er … das Opfer richtig [my italics] vollziehen” and “(selon) l’Ordre.” I follow Lü (436-39, esp. 439) in considering ṛtám ‘truth’ here a representation of ‘hymn’: “… möge … ein Lied darbringen.”
