Earth For a discussion of this hymn as an implicit riddle, see my “A Sanskrit Riddle in Three Movements: Rig Veda V.84,” in Beyond Hatti: A Tribute to Gary Beckman, ed. Billie Jean Collins and Piotr Michalowski, 2013, pp. 155-58. Its placement immediately after the Parjanya hymn, to which it is attached as a kind of pendant, is important. Note also that all three standard words for ‘earth’ are found in the hymn: pṛthivī́(1b), bhū́mi- (1c), and kṣám- (3b), though in different cases and usages. The riddling middle vs. lacks such a word.
