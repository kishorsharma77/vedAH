This vs. is a variant of 14, with the parts somewhat differently distributed.

The phrase devā́m̐áchā in b resembles ácha … mā́rutaṃ gaṇám in 14a, and it therefore seems prudent and economical to supply the same verb as in 14a.

Although in 14ab dānā́belonged to the same syntagm as ácha … mā́rutaṃ gaṇám, here it is construed with a different part of the sentence, with the opt. saceta ‘would/might/could keep company’. In 14 the poet was offering a gift to the Maruts; here he “keeps company with a gift” -- that is, receives it -- bestowed by the Maruts.

The situation is the standard reciprocal exchange of praise and worship for the gods for material benefits from the gods. The givers are first identified as sūrí-s ‘patrons’ (c), and one could think of the human patrons often so called, but pāda d makes it clear that the Maruts are meant, and the identification of the sūráyaḥ with the Maruts is even clearer in 16b.

The two instr. in d are off balance: yā́maśrutebhiḥ ‘famed on/by their course/journey’ modifies the Maruts, but, pace Gr, Ge, and WG, añjíbhiḥ should not, because añjí- is only a noun ‘unguent, adornment’ (see in the next hymn V.53.4), not the adj. their tr. require. Re recognizes the problem and suggests that it is an “instrumental of identification”: “en tant que (porteurs d’) ornements.” I think rather that yā́ma- and añjíbhiḥ are functionally parallel, both to be construed with śrutá-, but one in a cmpd and one in an independent syntagm. For similar interplay between cmpd member and independent word, see comm. ad VIII.1.2.

The real problem in this vs. is vakṣáṇā. In the publ. tr. I follow Ge and Re in taking it as an acc. pl. of vakṣáṇā ‘udder’, but of course this stem is fem. and the acc. pl. form here should be vakṣáṇāḥ. Ge (n. 15b) casually suggests that it is exceptionally neuter or else a mistake for vakṣáṇāḥ, Re that it’s a “nt. insolite.” Others provide different morphological analysis: Gr sets up a special stem vakṣáṇā ‘Darbringung’ and must take it as a nom. sg.; Old suggests emending the accent to

*vákṣaṇā, allowing it to belong to the stem vákṣaṇa- ‘strengthening’ and takes it as a
neut. nom. pl. (“wie zu den Göttern die Stärkungen”); WG maintain the ‘udder’ analysis but take it as a nom. sg.: “Der … (wendet) sich den göttlichen (Maruts) zu wie ein Schlauch (der gefüllt sein will).” This last is the most ingenious and does the least violence to the morphology / repertoire of stems, but the image is an odd one, to say the least. My explanation, admittedly rather weak, starts from the similar patterning of vss. 14 and 15: 1) the ácha + acc. gods noted above (though ácha differently positioned), in each case requiring a verb to be supplied; 2) dānā́(beg. of 14b/15c); 3) the parallel endings of the b pādas: 14b … ná yoṣánā / 15c … ná vakṣánā. The final word of each of these pādas is problematic: yoṣáṇā has the wrong accent, vakṣáṇā has the wrong ending. I suggest that the words were mutually adjusted to each other, either in composition or redactionally. Oldenberg already suggested (in his n. 2) that yoṣáṇā might owe its accent to vakṣáṇā, but the suggestion was halfhearted since he really wanted to emend the accent of vakṣáṇā to *vákṣaṇā, as I just noted. However, this seems the best explanation of the accent of yoṣáṇā, and conversely this allows us also to assume that acc. pl. *vakṣáṇāḥ lost its -ḥ to match yoṣánā. Although this may seem no different from Ge’s and Re’s arbitrary conferral of neut. gender, my explanation is contextually tied and has some possibility of being correct.
