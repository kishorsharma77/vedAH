Your age-old paths, Savitar, dustless, well-made in the midspace, along these easily passable paths (come) to us today. Both guard us and  speak on our behalf, o god.
The next eight hymns (I.36–43) are attributed to Kaṇva Ghaura, and the Kaṇva  family is named a number of times in this sequence. It is noteworthy that this collec tion does not contain a hymn to Indra. However, there are three hymns (I.37–39) to  the Maruts, Indra’s regular companions, and the following hymn, I.40, is dedicated  to Brahmaṇaspati. Indra figures prominently in that hymn and is in fact identified  with Brahmaṇaspati in it.
For the most part the style of these hymns is uncomplex but nicely balanced.
