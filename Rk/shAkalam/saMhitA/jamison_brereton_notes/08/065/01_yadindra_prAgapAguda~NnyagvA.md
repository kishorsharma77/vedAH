The nominative plural pres. part. gā́yantaḥ in c and the 1st singular huvé in d are grammatically incompatible but conceptually harmonious: this is the usual situation where the poet speaks both for himself and for the group of officiants he represents. Ge takes abc together and supplies a 1st plural verb (rufen wir), while I assume that the huvé of d has domain over the whole verse, with the plural participle in c a grammatical interruption.
