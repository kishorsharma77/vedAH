This vs. is cunningly constructed, in that until the very last word of the third pāda it consists entirely of genitives with nothing to depend on; neut. pl. vīryā̀ṇi at the end of c breaks this string and provides the necessary grammatical support -- joined by the matching adj. mahā́ni at the very end of the vs. ### 03
All four pādas begin with prá; the verb of a, ririce, should be supplied with the other three pādas.

Note the phonological plays in a: prá (mā)trā(bhī) and ririce roca(mānaḥ).
