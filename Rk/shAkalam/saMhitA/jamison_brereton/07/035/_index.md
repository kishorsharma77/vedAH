All Gods  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
15 verses: triṣṭubh  
This fifteen-verse hymn is in competition for the most boring hymn in the R̥gveda  (a competition in which there are remarkably few entries). In the first thirteen  verses every pāda begins with the indeclinable word śám “luck, weal” in the  hardly varying formula “luck for us be X,” with X a god or gods, power, or  sacrificial element. There is generally a rationale for the groupings found in each  

verse, though it not always transparent (see, e.g., vs. 3). The final two verses  (14–15) inclusively beg all the gods in various groupings to enjoy the praise and  grant space to us.
