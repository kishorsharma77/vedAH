The -ū́ka-stem jāgarū́ka- in b is found only here in Vedic. I wonder if it owes its -ka-suffix to the femininized context of c, where H+E are identified as “sisters and young women” (svásārā yuvatī́) despite their oppositely gendered names.

On -ka- in women’s language, see my “Women’s Language in the Rig Veda?” (Gd.

Elizarenkova, 2008) and “Sociolinguistic Remarks on the Indo-Iranian *-ka-Suffix: A Marker of Colloquial Register” (IIJ 53 [2009]).

Note the virtual mirror image of víyute (a) and yuvatī́(c).

I do not understand the use of ā́d u here. Ordinarily this old ablative has a fairly strong temporal (“just after that”) or logical (“because of that”) sense, but since c has a concessive force (“although being …”), it is difficult to get ā́d to have logical force, and the fact of being sisters but called different names does not seem to have a temporal dimension. It reminds of the ca … ā́d in 11cd, but there ā́d easily expresses a standard temporal sense. It is possible, but extremely speculative, that the ā́d does reflect some sort of cosmic temporality: H+E, originally joined together, had a single identity and gender, but after the cosmogonic separation they received different, and genderedly oppositional, names. The monism of the next vs. (8cd) might (barely) support such an idea; note that “the One” there is neut. (ékam).

The standard interpr. (see Ge, etc.) of mithunā́ni nā́ma is that their names are of different genders when they are given separate names, with dyaúḥ generally masc.

and pṛthivī́fem. But they are also paired sisters, with the fem. du. designation ródasī.

This seems correct, and the publ. tr. should probably have reflected this sense of mithuná- better. I am somewhat puzzled by why the names are in the plural, however.
