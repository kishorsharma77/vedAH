The imagery is somewhat mixed here: it is hard to see how either a missile (nom. aśániḥ) or a lance (instr. hetī́[contra Pp. hetíḥ, as seen already by Gr etc.]) can burn down anything. I assume it’s a transferred visual image from the fire simile, since flames can have a lance-like shape and shoot out dramatically.

The fem. instr. adj. phrase gambhīráya ṛṣváyā lacks an overt referent. Ge supplies Stimme without disc. In the absence of any obvious choices, I follow Gr in assuming hetī́from pāda b. Neither ṛṣvá- nor gambhīrá- has a standard fem. referent.

The obj. of rurója is likewise unexpressed. Ge supplies Burgen (púraḥ, a common obj. of this verb), but (n. 10cd) suggests that rákṣaḥ from b is also possible.

Since the yó rurója rel. clause of c is picked up by the main cl. of d, I instead supply duritā́, which is the obj. of the conjoined verbs of d. Elsewhere duritā́is the obj. of √han (IX.62.2, 90.6, 97.16), a verb semantically similar to √ruj.
