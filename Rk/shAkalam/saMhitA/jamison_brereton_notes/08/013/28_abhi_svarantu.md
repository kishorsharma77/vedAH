Note the chaining over tṛca boundary: 27c … abhí svara# / 28a #abhí svarantu.

Most interpreters (Ge, Old, Klein [I.383]) take sakṣata as the verb of the relative clause beginning yé táva, but it is unaccented. Old recognizes the problem but considers it unnatural to separate táva from śríyam and accounts for the lack of accent acdg to ZDMG 60, 737-38 [=Kl.Sch. 212-13], namely occasional lack of accent when the rel. pronoun and the verb are in different pādas (not, in my opinion, a compelling explanation in any of these cases). But yé táva functions fine as an independent rel. clause, and supplying ‘your’ again with śríyam is no problem in an independent clause.

Ge supplies “come” in c, but the verb in b can do duty here as well.

The Maruts, who were only latent in vs. 20 (and probably 17), appear here with Rudra, who was present in vs. 20. The Marut clans here may pick up the clans in 16c; see above.
