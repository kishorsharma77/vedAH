A complex vs., esp. in its earlier parts, with a variety of tr. I will treat only my own. But first a few textual adjustments. In b I read (with most interpr., going back to Ludwig; see Old and Ge’s n. 5b) agné ráveṇa rather than Pp. agnér áveṇa.

Note also that the sandhi between b and c has been wrongly resolved by HvN into bhojíye / a… rather than bhojíyā / i… (here Pp. is correct). And the first word of c has the wrong sibilant in the HvN text: it’s correctly iṣirā́ya, not iśirā́ya.

Also in b I take the simile as consisting only of marútāṃ ná rather than including bhojyā̀. This genitive modifies ráveṇa and is parallel to agné(r). The roaring of Agni is being compared to the roaring of the Maruts, personifications of the thunderstorm. This syntactic distribution is found in Old SBE, but subsequent tr.

have not followed him.

I take the bhojyā̀as nominative and the subject of an intrans./passive use of med. pṛñcáte, a usage found elsewhere. However, it is not impossible that this med.

form is transitive -- cf. ā́… pṛcīmahi in the next hymn (I.129.7) -- in which case I would supply ‘priests’ as subj.: “(The priests) infuse the (offering-)foods into his forces.” In pāda a I take táviṣīṣu ‘forces’ as a reference to Agni’s flames. Although táviṣī- ordinarily belong to Indra, see, e.g., III.3.5, 26.4 for táviṣībhiḥ in conjunction with Agni.

I tentatively take Indra as the referent for iṣirā́ya in c, as he is addressed as iṣira in the first vs. of the next hymn (I.129.1) and is several times the referent of this stem elsewhere. But I do not insist on this identification.

The ca in de is problematic, and this problem is connected with the question of the affiliation of vásūnām. Ge (fld. by Klein, DGRV I.234) takes ca as a clausal conjunction and supplies a 2nd verb “(beschenkt)” in d, parallel to ínvati in c. This requires that vásūnām be construed with majmánā (“mit einer Fülle von Gütern”).

But majmánā does not take a genitive of specification but only of possession and in any case its contexts favor ‘might’ over ‘abundance’. Several times it appears parallel with krátvā (including nearby I.141.6, 143.2) in the collocation “with resolve and with might,” as it would here, though at some remove (see krátvā in pāda a).

Forms of vásu- regularly occur with forms of √dā ‘give’, however, and so the most natural collocation here would be dā́nam … vásūnām “the giving of goods.” But what, then, to do with the ca? I think the clue is to be found in X.50.7 vásūnāṃ ca vásunaś ca dāváne “for the giving of goods and of good”; in other words, I think the vásūnāṃ ca in our passage is a truncated formula, with vásunaś ca gapped. But the omitted sg. vásu- is immediately inserted in the first pāda of the next verse (6a) and the number-neutralized stem occurs three times in vs. 8: vásudhitim (8a), vasūyávaḥ (8f, g). Note also that a different form of vásu appears to be gapped in 6ab. The poet slyly sets the vásu- agenda in 5de by introducing it with an off-balance expression that requires repair. For a similarly problematic ca involving (in my opinion) gapping, see the previous hymn, I.127.8 and disc. there.

The phrase śáṃsād aghā́t corresponds to the well-attested bahuvrīhi agháśaṃsa- ‘possessing evil speech’, found in the next hymn (I.129.6).
