The vs. contains 3 coreferential sá, at the beg. of a and of c and in the middle of c. I have interpr. the first half of c as belonging with ab, with the loc. tokásātā tánaye parallel to loc. mahatí vṛtratū́rye in b and the mid-pāda sá in c introducing a new cl. Others (Ge, Schaef., Intens. 126) take all of c with d. There is no way to determine and very little riding on it. However, see the comm. on the next vs. The hí in pāda a seems to have little or no causal value; similarly the one in 4a.

Although the overt ásti reminds us of the other overt forms of √as in previous vss. (3, 4, 5), which were (at least by my lights) existential, ásti here seems to be a straight copula and therefore pleonastic.

In tokásātā tánaye we can assume that tánaye shows a kind of gapping of the 2nd cmpd member found in toká-sāti-, hence a putative *tánaya-sāti-. Ge’s cited parallels, e.g., II.30.5 tokásya sātaú tánayasya …, confirm this.
