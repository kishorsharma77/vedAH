Ge (see his n. 8a) takes vayyàm as the PN of a hero aided by Indra to whom Soma is compared: “(einem zweiten) Vayya.” Although a hero of that name does exist, his presence seems limited to passages where he is mentioned with the better attested Turvīti (I.54.6, II.13.12, I.19.6) or, once, in a list of clients of the Aśvins (I.112.6). The du. form in II.3.6 vayyè (or vayyā̀; see comm. ad loc.) belongs to a separate stem vayī́- ‘weaver’. Despite Ge’s energetic attempt to justify it, the introduction of a minor hero from the Indra cycle makes no sense here (any more than his introduction of the Aśvins in vs. 5). I therefore adopt Re’s suggestion (disc.

in detail in his n.) that vayyà- here is a deriv. of vayā́- ‘branch, twig’, which could easily describe the soma, esp. as the pressed juice is circling the filter (see immed.

preceding paiprayántam) and leaving its twigs behind.

On the other hand, Ge’s explan. of suṣaṃsádam ‘keeping good company’ is persuasive; it refers either to the gods and priests or to the water and the milk (or, I would add, both).

The standard tr. (not, however, Scar [608]) construe diváḥ in c with vā́cam in d; cf., e.g., Re “… lance la voix (venue) du ciel,” which is then further interpr. as thunder (see Ge’s n. 8d, Ober II.209). But I prefer to take diváḥ with immed.

preceding ūrmíṇā for several reasons: 1) a pāda boundary and the verb intervene between diváḥ and vā́cam; 2) the ūrmí- from heaven is found in IX.49.1 apā́m ūrmíṃ divás pári; 3) the formulaic VP íyarti vā́cam (II.42.1, III.8.5, 34.2, IV.21.5, etc.) does not otherwise appear with a source of the speech specified. Surely the point here is that when the soma is being ritually prepared he/it inspires ritual speech.
