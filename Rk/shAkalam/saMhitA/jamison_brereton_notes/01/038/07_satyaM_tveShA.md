The standard interpr. of avāta- here is ‘windless’, but with Gr (see also Lub) I take it to the homonymous stem ‘unextinguishable, unquenchable’ (√vā ‘extinguish’).

The point here is that even in a waterless place the Maruts can make rain: wind is irrelevant, but water that doesn’t give out is crucial. Cf. avánīr avātā́ḥ “unquenchable streams” in I.62.10.
