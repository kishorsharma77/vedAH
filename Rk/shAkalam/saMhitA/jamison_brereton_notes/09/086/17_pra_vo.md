The publ. tr. does not make it clear that “your” is pl. (enclitic vaḥ) and must refer to the poet/officiants.

What is striking stylistically in this vs. is the sequence of three heavy nom. pl.

fem. -yu-adjectives: mandrayúvo vipanyúvaḥ, panasyúvaḥ, the latter two derived from the same root. Though morphologically parallel, they are somewhat disharmonious: mandrayú- is a hapax, vipanyú- is reasonably well attested and generally modifies the human officiants (gods a few times), while the rather fewer occurrences of panasyú- (and the related verb panasyá-) refer to gods. Hence the “thoughts” of our vs. seem both to “express admiration,” as humans do to gods, and “invite/require admiration,” as gods do from humans - so the thoughts’ purposes seem to be various, both to praise the gods and be admired for their fine crafting? I’m not exactly sure what saṃvásana- (a hapax), lit. ‘dwelling together, joint dwelling’ is expressing here. Ge seems similarly puzzled, tr. “in den Sitzungen” with a question mark; Re’s “dans les sessions-rituelles” is more definite and appealing, but I don’t see where he gets it. Perhaps it doesn’t indicate that the thoughts are dwelling with each other but that they, as a group, are dwelling with something/-one else - perhaps the soma, perhaps the milk and other non-verbal parts of the ritual machinery?
