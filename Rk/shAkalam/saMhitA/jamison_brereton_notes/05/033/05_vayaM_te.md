What constitutes the predicate in ab is disputed. Flg. Old and the model of VII.30.4, I take ab as constituting an “X and which Y” construction, with doubled “and which Y” (more accurately schematized as “X and which Y and (which) Z”).

The predication is simply te “of you, yours,” an assertion of possession. It is predicated of us (vayám té) as well as “which men” (yé ca náraḥ) and “(which) chariots” (… ca ráthāḥ) -- literally “we and which men and (which) chariots are yours.” Both of the latter two are further characterized in b, the men by a participial phrase (śárdho jajñānā́ḥ “having been born as a troop”), the chariots by a simple participle (yātā́ḥ ‘driven, driving’). WG seem to follow this interpr. as well, though with some filigree in the middle that seems over-elaborate. Klein (DGRV I.49 n. 10) sets out the schema as above and tr. sim. (I.196). Ge by contrast takes the predication to be śárdho jajñānā́ḥ, applied to both us and the men, with the chariots left hanging: essentially “we and the man are born as your troop, and the chariots.” Besides the syntactic isolation of the chariots in Ge’s rendering, it also unduly extends the reference of śárdho jajñānā́ḥ. The “men” of pāda a must be, as often, the Maruts, and it is only they who “have been born as a troop,” not also us. The word gaṇá- is almost exclusive to the Maruts, and the birth of the Maruts is a common topic (e.g., I.64.2, 4).

The phrase rátho ná yātáḥ appears in I.141.8. See comm. there, where I suggest that a yātá- rátha- is a particular kind of chariot, perhaps one meant for long journeys, rather than referring to the current state of motion of any specific chariot(s).

The problem with pāda c is the clash between the voc. ahiśuṣma and the 3rd sg.

verb jagamyāt with its nom. subj. sátvā. The stem sátvan- in the sg. is almost always used of Indra, and in this context -- a hymn dedicated to Indra and both praising his powers and begging him to deploy them on our behalf -- it is difficult to imagine that we would then express a wish that some indefinite or at least unidentified warrior should come our way instead (as in Ge’s “Uns möge … ein Krieger kommen”; WG almost identical). Surely Indra is the warrior we want! This would require a shift from 2nd to 3rd ps. ref. between ab and cd, but this is not problematic. What is problematic is the voc., which should also refer to Indra. Gr solves this by positing a bahuvr. ahiśuṣma-sátvan- ‘whose warriors have a serpent’s hiss’ (‘dessen Helden wie Schlangen zischen’). Unfortunately the accent is definitively against this interpr.

I have no neat solution, but am firm in my belief that the sátvā is Indra. For a similar vocative/nominative cross, see vasavānaḥ in the next vs. (6a); these two problems may be connected.

I take the simile in d as an elaborate pun, playing on the double sense of the three members, bhága-, hávya-, and prabhṛthá-. The first can be both the name of the god Fortune and a common noun ‘portion’; hávya- can belong to √hū, hvā ‘call’ or √hu ‘pour, offer’; pra √bhṛ can refer either to the presentation of arms (and the carrying off of booty) in a hostile situation or to the presentation of offerings at a sacrifice. Cf. the double sense of prá √bhṛ in nearby V.32.4-5, 7 and comm. there.

The first meanings just given for the three items coalesce into one simile, the second ones in another.
