Agni  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
3 verses: uṣṇih  
A curious pendant to Dīrghatamas’s Agni cycle, with many puzzles despite its  brevity. The poet seems to begin by declaring his allegiance and service to Agni  and making his claim for guest-friendship (hence the “stranger” in vs. 1) and pro tection on that basis. In verse 2 he rejects the patronage of a non-sacrificer, despite  his riches, while in verse 3 he returns to the benefits that accrue to the devotee  of Agni.
