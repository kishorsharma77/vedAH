Ge tr. the infinitival gṛṇīṣáni as a modal “soll … loben.” Similarly Keydana, who takes it as a “matrix infinitive” with 2nd ps. subject but tr. modally (“… sollt ihr euch zu Hilfe besingen,” 174, 246). Because it is locative in form, I am somewhat dubious about assigning it this value, which is typical, and understandable, for dative infinitivals.

I have reordered the elements in c to make the sentence parsable. That the refrain vy ā̀naśuḥ should be construed with what precedes is shown by the parallel
