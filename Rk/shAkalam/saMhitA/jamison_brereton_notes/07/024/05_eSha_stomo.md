Uncompounded vṛddhied vā́h- to √vah ‘convey’ is attested only here, but it is common in compounds, e.g., indra-vā́h- (4x). See Scar (473-80; for the grade of the root, esp. 479).

The two different simile markers in b (iva … ná) may be highlighting two different aspects of the complex simile.

The genitive of goods with √īḍ ‘invoke’ is somewhat aberrant. Although for this root Gr allows acc., dat., or gen. of the material desired, the only other genitive passage he cites is VIII.31.14, where the genitive is otherwise to be construed.

However, there seems nothing else to do with vásūnām, and the construction is reminiscent of nearby VII.32.5 ... śrútkarṇa īyate vásūnām “he of listening ears is implored for goods.” Moreover, in X.20.2 agním īḷe bhujā́m, the gen. pl. bhujā́m is best interpr. this way (“I invoke Agni for delights”), contra the standard interpr.

Alternatively we could assume the gapping of a noun like sambháraṇam ‘assemblage’ as in the next hymn, VII.25.2d sambháraṇaṃ vásūnām, but this seems less likely.

In d the śrómatam is presumably the ‘hearing” that gods extend to men’s hymns. See VII.32.5 just cited for a similar sentiment.

The simile divī̀va dyā́m is opaque to me. Ge tr. “Wie Tag auf Tag,” but neither of these case forms of div-/dyu- is used temporally, but only spatially of ‘heaven’.

Placing “heaven upon heaven” must refer to Indra’s cosmogonic deeds, but the connection with Indra’s activity in the frame is vague. Old believes that setting heaven on heaven means that Indra is fixing heaven in its proper place.
