Acdg. to Re, Mehendale interpr. the curious formation yātumā́vant- in pāda a (also I.36.20, VII.1.5, VIII.60.20) not as a metrical variant of yātumánt- (so AiG II.2.775) but as a haplology for *yātu-māyyā́vant-. I assume (I have not seen the art.) that his posited form contains -māyā́- in one form or another and anticipates the next vs. where the female sorcerer is “exulting in her magic power” (māyáyā śā́śadānām), though I don’t know why the form posited is not just *yātu-māyā́vant-, containing attested māyā́vant- ‘possessing māyā’ (IV.16.9). If we accept this 146 suggestion, or modified suggestion, the tr. could be slightly altered to “the demonic power of those possessing the magic power of sorcerers.” The kimīdín- was singular in vs. 2, but a dual matched pair (mithunā́yā́ kimīdínā) here. Why the dual is not entirely clear, but the next vs. specifies both male and female sorcerers as Indra’s target, and the mithuná- here suggests a sexual pairing.
