Although they belong to different tṛcas, 10ab responds to vs. 9: in both Indra is characterized by the lexeme abhí √bhū ‘dominate, surmount’ (9c abhibhū́ḥ, 10a abhibhū́taram), with each governing an NP beginning with víśva-. Moreover, in vs. 9 it is said that gods (as well as mortals) have not attained (āśata) Indra, while in 10ab the gods appear to be the implied subject of the verbs tatakṣuḥ and jajanuḥ “fashioned and begot” - in other words, paradoxically, though they do not attain him they are credited with creating him.

In c there is pseudo-etymological play between váriṣṭḥaṃ váre, which not only are unrelated but also belong to two different NPs, despite their adjaceny. There is some uncertainty about the position of utá or even what it is conjoining. Klein (DGRV I.346, 349) considers the pāda an XY utá construction, joining the two complex NPs that precede it, with the adjectives in d “merely strung on to the basical phrasal syntagm” (346).

The etymological figure ugrám ójiṣṭham, with a positive and its superlative, is reminiscent of the simplex followed by comparative in 9c / 10a abhibhū́ḥ …  abhibhū́taram. The rest of pāda d, tavásam tarasvínam, almost mimics an etymological figure via phonological scrambling, although the words are of course unrelated.
