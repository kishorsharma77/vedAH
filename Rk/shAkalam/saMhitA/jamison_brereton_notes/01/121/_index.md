Indra or the All Gods This is a very problematic hymn, and both the publ. tr. and this comm. are tentative and tenuous on many points. There are some quirks that reappear throughout the hymn: a remarkable no. of pāda-final góḥ (2b, 2d, 7b, 9a) - is this some sort of hidden encoding? It’s also part of a pattern of favoring pāda-final monosyllables (vrā́m 2c, rā́ṭ 3a, dyū́n 3b, 7c, dyā́m 3d, vaḥ 4d, nṝ́n 12a, 13a, dā́t 12c

- and, flg. Hoffmann, daḥ 10d). Also a fondness for pári and prá, the former esp. in
opaque contexts.
