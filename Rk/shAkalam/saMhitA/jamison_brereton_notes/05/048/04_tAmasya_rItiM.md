This vs. is characterized by words regularly (though not exclusively) associated with Agni: ánīka- ‘face’, várpas- ‘form’, rátnam √dhā ‘establish a treasure’. This vocabulary gives support to my suggestion that Agni is also the subject of vs. 3, esp. since the asya in pāda a (and b) should refer to something already present in the discourse.

As for the tā́m … rītím paraśór iva, most comm. appositely compare V.7.8 prá svádhitīva rī́yate “(Agni) streams forth like an ax.” I consider the rītím to continue the liquid imagery of 3b. The abstract rītí- in its 4 other occurrences is either construed with the gen. pl. apā́m (VI.13.1, IX.108.10) or implicitly with other liquid vocabulary; cf. also the cmpd. rītyā̀p- (2x). The attempts by most interpr. to impose a different sense (e.g., Re ‘l’élan-destructeur’) on this transparent deriv. of √rī ‘flow’ seem to stem from discomfort with the image, and esp. the simile of the ax.

But the arc of sparks that sprinkle the mace in 3b (by my interpr.) would look like a stream, and anyone who has ever watched a person swing an ax (properly) would recognize the image: the fluent movement in a stream-like curve. (There are numerous You-tube videos.) For bhárahūti- see comm. ad I.129.2, V.29.8.

Ge, flg. Gr., reverses 4cd and 5ab. I do not see the necessity for this. It puts the two forms of (-)ánīka- in the same vs. and continues the description of Agni begun in 4ab, but leaving the hemistichs in their transmitted order certainly causes less thematic disruption than most changes of topic in the RV.
