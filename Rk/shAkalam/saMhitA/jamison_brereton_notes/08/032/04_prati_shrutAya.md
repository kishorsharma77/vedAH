With Ge I supply both “bring” and “soma,” though I would prefer to have more formulaic or textual support for providing this extraneous material - however, cf. II.14.8 gábhistipūtam bharata śrutā́ya “Bring what is purified by your hand [=soma] to the one who is famed,” adduced by Ge. The preverb práti occurs with √bhṛ (see, e.g., VIII.20.9 práti … śárdhāya mā́rutāya bharadhvam / havyā́…), but is not common.

tū́rṇāśa- is a hapax without etymology (though Old’s literal gloss, “was dem Ueberschreitenden Verschwinden, Untergang bringt,” implies √tṝ and √naś, without attempting to explain the morphology). I follow the consensus, that the word refers to a watercourse of some sort, since that makes sense in context. As often, verbal play may have had a role in its appearance here: 4b #tū́rṇāśaṃ ná ... is partly echoed by 5c púraṃ ná śūra … (ūr/ur na am ś, though not in the same order in both).
