Soma Pavamāna
Ayāsya Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
The hymn is defined by a thematic ring: Soma has his gaze on men in verse 1 and in  the final verse (6) he gazes out on the reward he gives to his human praiser. Soma,

as usual, goes on his purificatory journey through the filter (vss. 1–2) and is mixed  with milk (vs. 3), but unlike many of the recent soma hymns, this one also focuses  on the stage beyond the filter, with striking images in verses 4 and 5.
