The nominal rel. cl. in ab has no resumptive prn. in the main cl. of c, though “with these/them” is clearly the intent.

On the construction of dhū́rvane here, see Keydana, Infin. 247, though the arbitrary line he tends to draw between “true” infinitives and datival purpose nouns seems over-strict here.

As is shown by IX.29.5 rákṣa ... svanā́t samasya kásya cit (cited by Ge), nidáḥ must be an abl. (as we would expect in any case with a form of √rakṣ) with a dependent gen., the indefinite samasya.
