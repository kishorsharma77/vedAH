Again the first hemistich has a predicated infinitive, like 2ab, 4ab. In fact the structure is identical to that in 4: auśijó huvádhyai# (4b, 5a). But otherwise the verse is difficult to comprehend (as Ge says in n. 5, “Voll dunkler Beziehungen”), and tr.

differ considerably. I will not treat them in detail.

The object(s) of huvádhyai should first be sorted out: the two acc. ruvaṇyúm and sáṃsam. Are the two coreferential and what are their referent(s)? ruvaṇyú- is a hapax but clearly derived from the denom. (/deverb.?) stem ruvaṇya- (also a hapax) and ultimate from the root √ru ‘bellow, roar’. Ge (/WG) takes ruvaṇyúm as a qualifier of śáṃsam, which he treats as a PN (“den lauten Śaṃsa”), perhaps standing for Nāraśaṃsa. This is not impossible, but given the mysterious āyóḥ in 4d and auśijáḥ in both 4b and 5a, I am reminded the phrase uśíjaḥ śáṃsam āyóḥ (IV.6.11, V.3.4). In both passages we (SWJ and JPB respectively) take śáṃsam āyóḥ “the laud of Āyu” as a designation of Agni; in both we take the form uśíjaḥ as the nom. pl.

designation of a type of priest, who do homage to Agni under this name. Note also that II.31.6 contains śáṃsam uśíjām, with the Āyus featuring in the next verse (II.31.7b) as makers of hymns. I therefore think that śáṃsam in this verse should be combined with the mysterious āyóḥ at the end of the previous verse into a putative underlying phrase *śáṃsam āyóḥ, referring to Agni, modified by ruvaṇyúm.

Incomplete phrases straddling verse divisions are found in vss. 3-4 and 12-13 (though in those instances the complete phrase appears in the 2nd vs.); see comm. above on vs. 3. I would thus change the text of the publ. tr. to “It is for (Kakṣīvant), son of Uśij, to call the bellower, the ‘Laud (of Āyu)’ [=Agni], for you.” Agni can be characterized as ‘bellowing, roaring’ because of the crackling of his flames. The “you” are the priests (etc.) on whose behalf Kakṣīvant is acting. Agni was ritually presented in the previous hemistich (4c) under a different epithet, and his “mothers” (the kindling sticks) in 4d. A “roaring” Agni would come into being following the kindling about to take place in 4d. An invocation to Agni’s comrades ends this verse (5d). The context thus favors Agni.

The next problem is ghóṣeva. Ge (/WG) takes this as the fem. PN Ghoṣā, the erstwhile spinster, found in a nearby Kakṣīvant hymn (I.117.7) where the Aśvins bestowed a husband on her, as well as in the famous sequence of hymns X.39-41 attributed to her (with the patronymic Kākṣīvatī) and her son. Despite the close connection of Kakṣīvant with this Ghoṣā, I doubt that she figures in the strictly liturgical context here, and those who think she does must assume that Arjuna is the name of her acquired husband, for which there is no evidence. I take the form rather as the old instr. ghóṣā to the masc. common noun ghóṣa- ‘shout, cry’, though I admit the simile seems a bit lame. Re’s grammatical interpr. is the same as mine; his tr.

“semblable à une rumeur (de guerre)” is less lame, but even less supported.

náṃśé occurs twice in the RV, here and in 12b in this hymn, both times preceded by a genitive. There seems no reason not to take it, with Gr etc., as the loc. sg. to a stem náṃśa- ‘at/on the attainment’ construed with the gen. As for árjunasya, lit. ‘silver(y)’, I suggest that it refers to soma; cf. ṛjīṣín- ‘possessing the silvery drink [=soma]’ (so Thieme), with the Caland form ṛji- to this same etymon. Unfortunately árjuna- doesn’t elsewhere characterize soma. Nonetheless, the fact that the other occurrence of náṃśe (12b) takes a genitive that also probably refers to soma gives some support to this interpr.

The initial prá in c, echoing those in 1a and 4c, suggests that this hemistich has a structure parallel to those two. Hence my “(put him) forward”; other tr. supply other material to complete the clause. The meter of this pāda is deficient, lacking three syllables. Various restorations have been suggested (see Old, Prol. 113 n. 1 [=Engl. tr. 133 n. 3]; HvN metrical notes ad loc.). Old (Prol.) suggests an impv. like arcata or gāyata, noting the structural similarity to 4c, but in the Noten he suggests that the metrical irregularity of Kakṣīvant’s I.120 might indicate that the text here is correctly transmitted and that the meter must be taken as is. It is certainly difficult to see how a trisyllabic verb form would have simply got dropped here.

I do not understand how Pūṣan comes to be named in this august divine company, and I wonder if the abbreviated meter of this pāda has something to do with the dedicand: the only hymns addressed solely to Pūṣan in the RV, VI.53-58, consist entirely of dimeter hymns save for the last. The 8-syllable pāda here might signal his more humble stature.

vasútāti- is another word that occurs in the RV only here and in vs. 12 of this same hymn. Its formation is of course transparent, but its meaning is less so. Most take it as a true abstract to vásu- ‘good(s)’, but with a slight twist to ‘generosity’ (Freigebigkeit). But the lexeme ácha √vac seems to be a technical ritual term for ‘invite’ (cf. áchokti- and the later priestly title acchāvāka-) with gods as the object.

Gr suggests the meaning ‘Schaar der Guten, d.h. der Götter’ for the occurrence in vs. 12 (but not this one), which I have adopted for both instances. It would be equiv. to devátāti- ‘assemblage/conclave of gods’. The pāda would then refer to the group of divinities that Agni regularly conveys to the sacrifice.
