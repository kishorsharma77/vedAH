The Maruts recur for the third time (the 2nd time in the corporate entity, the Marutian troop [mā́rutaṃ śárdhaḥ]), as does Pūṣan, with Bṛhaspati substituting for the Brahmaṇaspati in 3c. Varuṇa and Mitra also make their 3rd appearance, this time with their regular companion Aryaman, rather than the Aditi of 3a.
