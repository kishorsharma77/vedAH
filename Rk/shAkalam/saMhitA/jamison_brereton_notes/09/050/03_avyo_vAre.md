Just as vs. 2 picks up and varies vs. 1, vs. 3 chains with vs. 2: the loc. “on the sheep’s back” (ávye … sā́navi) of 2c is immediately followed by “on the sheep’s fleece” (ávyo vā́re). Given the sandhi of the first ‘sheep’ (ávya éṣi) and the juxtaposition of the two phrases, one might at first consider going against the Pp in 2c to read ávyaḥ, matching the same apparent form in 3a, However, it is a curious fact of the morphology of these formulae that the loc. phrase containing ‘back’ (sā́navi, sā́no) always has the loc. ávye to the ‘sheep’ adj. ávya-, while the phrase containing vā́ra- ‘fleece’ always has the gen. ávyaḥ to the ‘sheep’ noun ávi-. To capture this the tr. of the two phrases in vss. 2-3 should be switched: “on the sheep’s back” and “on the fleece of the sheep” - though this is hardly a momentous change.
