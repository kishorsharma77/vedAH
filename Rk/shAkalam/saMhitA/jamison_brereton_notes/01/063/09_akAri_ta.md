I supply ‘hymn’ as subject for ákāri in the first pāda and take bráhmāṇy ùktā in b as a separate nominal clause. It is of course grammatically possible to take the latter phrase as subject of ákāri, since neuter plurals famously can take singular verbs.

But, fame aside, this construction is quite rare in the RV, and in this case there are two different recipients, Indra in a and the horses in b. However, I do not consider the other interpretation impossible.
