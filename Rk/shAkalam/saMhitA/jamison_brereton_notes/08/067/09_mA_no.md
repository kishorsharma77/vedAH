In ab I supply a transitive form of √mṛc ‘harm’ to be construed with the cognate instr. root noun. The fact that the verb of pāda c, (abhí prá) mṛkṣata, though derived from √mṛś ‘touch’, could technically be an s-formation to √mṛc makes the generation of a verb from that root easier, and in fact we might consider mṛkṣata as representing both ‘harm’ and ‘seize’. Old notes the phonological play.

In its other two occurrences aviṣyú- has the negative sense ‘greedy’ and is clearly related to avasá- ‘food’, etc. (see EWA s.v. avasá-), but here it must be positive. I assume a portmanteau pun, combining ‘greedy’ with an association with √av ‘help’, resulting in ‘greedy[=eager] to help’.
