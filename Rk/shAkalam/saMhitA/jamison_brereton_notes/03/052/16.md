Besides the continuing problem of sasarparī́-, the other difficulty is the hapax pakṣyā̀in c. Gr takes it as ‘aus Monatshälften bestehend’ (flg. BR), Ge (/WG) ‘auf meiner Seite stehend’, Re as ‘ailée’ or ‘prenant parti (pour moi)’. The publ. tr.

strikes out on its own (though closest to Re’s first alternative). It involves reading sā́pakṣyā̀against the Pp (but involving no change in the Saṃhitā text), to be divided sā́apakṣyā̀. The latter would be the instr. of a nominal abstract in - i yā- (see AiG II.2.840), a rare but attested type built primarily to -a-stems. Here potentially to apakṣá- ‘wingless’ (cf. AV XI.5.21), hence ‘winglessness’. What might this bizarre confection have to do with the passage? The rather flimsy connection is via the daughter of the Sun (sū́ryasya duhitā́in 15c) and a possible reference to Dawn in 16c: the same phrase návyam ā́yur dádhānā is used of Dawn in VII.80.2). (Like) the former, Sasarparī has stretched the Kuśikas’ fame to the gods; (like) the latter, she has brought fame to all the five peoples. These feats might be expected to require special forms of transport, such as wings, if the agent is not a supernatural traveler like Dawn or the Sun’s Daughter. But Sasarparī is a cow, hence wingless.

I realize how fragile -- and potentially ludicrous -- this suggestion is, however, and it might be better to play it safe with something like ‘on my side’.
