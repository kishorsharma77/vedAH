On c see the disc. ad vs. 1. The verb here, 2nd sg. impv. (ā́) pava, is the only act.

form to this extraordinarily well-attested Class 1 pres. stem and is obviously truncated from pávasva, in order to fit this exact paraphrase of 1a (see comm. above) into the allotted syllables (asmábhyam being a syllable-hog compared to naḥ). It may help that dhāva in 4b is almost a rhyme. Like many morphological anomalies, pava can be accounted for through sensitivity to the larger context.
