Brahmaṇaspati
Kaṇva Ghaura
8 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
Brahmaṇaspati, “Lord of the Sacred Formulation,” is addressed in this hymn, but  this divine figure with his transparent name is only a means to accomplish other  ends. As the patron deity of ritual speech, Brahmaṇaspati will make the poet’s  speech effective enough to bring the other gods, especially Indra, to our sacrifice  (vss. 1–2). In the second pragātha (vss. 3–4) the poet seeks Brahmaṇaspati’s indirect help. If the poet’s efforts on behalf of the sacrifice are successful, his patron stands  to gain (see esp. vs. 4cd), and the patron then should give liberal rewards to the  singer (vs. 4a). It is striking that the patron is here called a “hero” and promised,  in the famous inherited phrase, “imperishable fame”—not for his exploits on the  battlefield, but for his generosity to his poet.
The test comes in the following pragātha (vss. 5–6):  the new mantra under  the patronage of Brahmaṇaspati is pronounced both by Brahmaṇaspati and by  the human actors at the ritual. If it is a properly formulated mantra, it will bring  the desired success. Judging from the final pragātha (vss. 7–8), ritual success was  achieved, and this success is expressed in strikingly sexual terms: both the patron’s  dwelling place and his power to rule are infused with productive sexuality (vss. 7d,  8a). He also gains the gods as his allies (8a), and, most surprising of all, becomes  identified as the god Indra himself (8cd), via the very last word in the hymn, vajrín “wielder of the mace,” a qualifier otherwise only of Indra.
