Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
Within a slender frame depicting Indra’s presence at and participation in our sac rifice is fitted a celebration of Indra’s great deeds and, especially, his aggressiveness  in performing them. The hymn begins (vs. 1) with a brief catalogue of the elements  Indra wants at the ritual, which leads immediately to the praise of Indra’s uncon trolled power, the terror he inspires in the cosmos, and the fortunate result of his  greatest deed, the release of the waters following his defeat of Vr̥tra (vss. 2–7). Verse  8 marks a return to the ritual here-and-now, with a hope that our preparations will  bring Indra to our sacrifice. Verses 9–10 then list the various things we want Indra  to do for us, marked by the heavy repetition of “for us/to us” at the beginning of  every half-verse (a pattern actually begun in vs. 8c with “toward us,” and ending  with an extra repetition in the final pāda 10d). The hymn ends with the Vāmadeva  Indra-cycle refrain (vs. 11).
