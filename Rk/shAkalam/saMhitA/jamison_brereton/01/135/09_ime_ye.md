Here, o Vāyu, are those oxen of yours [=soma drinks? Maruts?],
arm-strong, which fly in the river—the oxen that are greatly arrogant— that are not swift though on dry land, yet are nimble in the mountains  though their home is not there,
like the reins [=rays] of the sun difficult to hold back—difficult for the  hands to hold back.
