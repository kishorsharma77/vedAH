The 2nd pl. impv. etana shows an unexpected full-grade root syllable in the Saṃhitā text, but is read with metrically problematic but morphologically “correct” zero-grade in the Pp (itana). Of course, such full-grade 2nd pl. impvs. are found elsewhere, but in this case I wonder if it’s a secondary extraction from forms cmpded with the preverb ā́, as in V.87.8, also a Marut hymn, with pāda-final étana. See also disc. ad VI.42.2.
