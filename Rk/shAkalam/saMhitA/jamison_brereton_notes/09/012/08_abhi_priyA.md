As noted just above, hinvāná- is used passively here, in contrast to the same form in 7c -- here referring to the priestly impulsion given to the soma on its journey of purification.

The “tracks of heaven” are, in my view, the traces of the soma on the filter; see 10.9.

Pāda c is identical to IX.44.2c, where I do not construe víprasya with dhā́rayā but with something earlier in the vs. My reason there is that the dhā́rā- ‘stream’ is always otherwise only Soma’s, and so should not belong to the/a vípra-. But in our passage there is nowhere to construe víprasya but with dhā́rayā. I consider ad IX.44.2 the possibility that the pāda was borrowed thoughtlessly here. But there are several ways to make sense of our passage. If the dhā́rā- is Soma’s, the point may be that he is a kaví-, a sage, but he also has the fluency of an inspired poet, who simply pours out verbal eloquence, thus identifying Soma with both types of poet. This suggestion is supported by the next hymn, IX.13.2, where Soma is explicitly identified as a vípra-, as well as his parallel identification as vípra and kaví in IX.18.2. Or dhā́rā- can be used here metaphorically to refer to a stream of words.
