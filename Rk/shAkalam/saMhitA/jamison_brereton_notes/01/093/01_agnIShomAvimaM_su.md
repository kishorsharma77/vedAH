BR corrected sám mahema to sám ahema ‘we would bind together’ to √nah, an emendation accepted by Gr, Ge, Old (tentatively), KEWA I.153. Although I also accepted it in Jamison 1983: 87, I now follow Gotō (1987: 243; accepted in EWA s.v.) in seeing it as a form of √mah ‘bring about’, etymologically separate from √mah ‘magnify’. Although I do not like multiplying entities, Gotō’s etymological connections look reasonable; an interpretation with ‘make great’ is difficult; and a thematic pres. or aor. stem aha- to √nah does not exist and the zero-grade (<*nh̥ ) that would have to underlie it is not otherwise found to √nah.
