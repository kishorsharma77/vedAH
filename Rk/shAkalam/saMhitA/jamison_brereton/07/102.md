Parjanya
Kumāra Āgneya or Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: gāyatrī
As simple and straightforward an address to Parjanya as the preceding hymn was  cryptic and complex.
## 1
To Parjanya sing forth—to the son of heaven who grants rewards. Let him seek pasturage for us.
## 2
Who creates the embryo of the plants, of the cows, of the steeds,
of human women—Parjanya—
## 3
Just to him, in his mouth, pour a most honeyed oblation.
He will make lasting refreshment for us.
