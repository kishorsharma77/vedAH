The identity of the subj. of udīráyanti in b is left undefined. Re takes it as the rivers of pāda a, WG as the Maruts, and Ge leaves it undefined (“diese”). Although my publ. tr. likewise uses a noncommittal pronoun, I am inclined to think it is the rivers because of the úd ‘up’, contrasting with the áva ‘down’ qualifying the action of the lightning in c. The noise the rivers make would be the roaring resulting from streams swollen by rainfall, hence the qualifier abhíyam ‘coming from clouds” for their speech.

In d I take yádī as standing for yád ī, with acc. ī referring to the earth.
