I don’t know what the Maruts are doing here.

In c I have rendered the nom. pres. part. sán concessively, in its usual value, but it’s not exactly clear what the concession would be. Perhaps the contrast is between Soma as poet - so emphasized by kavíḥ … kā́vyena kavíḥ -- and the less than melodious sound indicated by the root √ribh ‘squawk, rasp’ (see comm. ad VI.3.6, IX.66.9).
