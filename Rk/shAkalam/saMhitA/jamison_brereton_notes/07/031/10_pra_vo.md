Much phonetic and morphological play, with the repeated prá’s, the repetition of mahé mahi- (note that this replicates the mahé … máhi of VII.30.1cd), and, especially, the chiastic finale: prá carā carṣaṇiprā́ḥ, where the last element, the root noun -prā́ḥ, is of course unrelated to the first one, the preverb prá. 35
