I take b with c, rather than with a as do the standard tr., since “the yoking of mind,” whatever it may precisely mean, harmonizes better with the thought, songs, and mind of the rest of the verse than with the more physical manifestation of the sacrifice in pāda a. As for the meaning of the phrase, I assume that it is part of the larger conceptual complex likening the sacrifice and its various elements to a chariot and its associated elements. The yoking or harnessing of mind refers to embarking on concentrated and deliberate mental effort for the sake of the sacrifice. Cf. Mitra and Varuṇa’s yoking of their skill in 4cd.

“Yoking of mind” actually contains the pl. práyuktiṣu, but the pl. form is probably the result of a mechanical metrical adjustment: mánaso ná práyukti (shortvowel instr.) is found at pāda end in X.30.1 in a Triṣṭubh cadence, and this phrase was converted into a Jagatī cadence here by the addition of -su. The other two occurrences of the stem práyukti- are likewise pāda-final in Triṣṭubh and end in -ti(ḥ).

One of these, … ná práyuktiḥ, is found two hymns after this one, in I.153.2, where I (so also Re) take the phrase as abbreviated from *mánaso ná práyukti-, as here.
