The sense of this vs. is a little odd: it sounds as if the Aśvins on their journey are snacking on the comestibles they are bringing to us and we will only get the scraps. This is not the usual way to urge the gods to bring us things and makes the Aśvins sound mingy. Perhaps the point is rather that there are so many (pūrvī́ḥ) refreshments that there’s enough for everyone? Ge compares 19c, which does not seem similar to me.
