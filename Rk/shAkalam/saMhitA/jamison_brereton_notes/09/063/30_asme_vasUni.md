The first pāda of this, the final vs., echoes the last pāda of the first vs.: 1c asmé śrávāṃsi dhāraya, 30a asmé vásūni dhāraya. It is also worth noting that this 2nd sg. impv.

dhāraya ‘secure’ is phonologically almost identical to the instr. sg. dhā́rayā ‘with/in a stream’, which ends the first pāda of this tṛca (28a) and which is found four other times in the hymn (4c, 7a, 14b, 21b), always in the same metrical position.
