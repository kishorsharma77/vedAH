The sense and derivation of gó-nyoghas- are disputed. Ge tr. “der die Kühe würdigt” and tentatively connects the 2nd member with what he cites as ny òhate in V.52.11. I do not construe ní with ohate in that passage (see comm. ad loc.), in part because √uh does not otherwise appear with ní. The sense he attributes to the cmpd is also rather jarring. He is followed in both sense (“respectant les vaches”) and derivation by Re., who adds to the dossier of parallels I.180.5 gór óheṇa, which, however, is too riddled with uncertainties (see comm. ad loc.) to provide good evidence. By contrast Old considers BR’s conjectured emendation *gó-nyokas- ‘accustomed to cows’ (?—he doesn’t gloss) very likely. He rejects the view that the cmpd as transmitted contains an s-stem oghas- ‘flood’, related to later Vedic ogha-, aughá- ‘flood’ (even though he states that if we stick with the transmitted text he would tr. “auf den die Kuh(milch) hernieder flutet”). This dismissal of a potential

*oghas- is shared by Mayr (EWA s.v. ogha-): “RV 9,97,10 gónyoghas- ist nicht für
ein ved. *oghas- ‘Strömung’ verwertbar.” Mayr instead tentatively follows the Ge/Re interpr. (s.v. OH), “vielleicht ‘die Kühe preisend’ od. dgl.” I am puzzled by this blanket rejection, esp. from Mayr, who cites (s.v. ogha-) with approbation Narten’s positing (YH 221) of an Indo-Iranian root √*uag̯ h ‘fliessen’, found in ogha-, aughá-.

Admittedly, there is no independently attested s-stem *óghas-. But consider the semantically and morphologically parallel gó-arṇas- (4x) ‘having a flood of cows’, with the well-attested s-stem árṇas- ‘flood’. It is easy (at least for me) to imagine that an s-stem *óghas- was coined in analogy to árṇas- for just this cmpd.
