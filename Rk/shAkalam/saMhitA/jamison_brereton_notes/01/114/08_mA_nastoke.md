The bahuvrīhi áriṣta-vīra- ‘possessing heroes who cannot be harmed’ in 3d is echoed by vīrā́n mā … vadhīḥ “Don’t smite our heroes,” with the cmpd evoked by rīriṣaḥ ‘don’t harm’, which ends the preceding pāda. I suggest that the pattern of pāda-init. mā́found through all of vs. 7 and the 1st half of 8 is broken here so that rīriṣah / vīrā́n can be juxtaposed.

The final pāda of the vs. also recalls vs. 3, in a somewhat sly way: 3d ends juhavāma te havíḥ “We will pour you an oblation,” with an etymological figure as noted above. Compare 8d havíṣmantaḥ … tvā havāmahe, also with a form of havísand a 1st pl. verb, which, despite its superficial similarity to juhavāma, belongs to the separate root √hū, hvā ‘call’, which has been amply represented in the hymn by the alternative pres. stem hvayāmahe (4b, 5b).

The adv. sádam ‘always’ is almost always followed by íd, which seems to add no special nuance.
