The first pāda, sá pavasva madintama, is almost identical to 4a ā́pavasva madintama. This is somewhat reminiscent of the near identity of 1a and 2a.

As noted in the publ. intro., I consider aktúbhiḥ a pun. The first reading would be as etym. figure with añjānáḥ ‘being anointed’; cf. III.17.1 aktúbhir ajyate, VI.69.3 añjantv aktúbhiḥ. But well-attested aktúbhiḥ is otherwise a temporal designation, ‘with/through the nights’, e.g., I.50.7 áhā mímāno aktúbhiḥ “measuring the days with the nights.” In this case perhaps it would refer to the Atirātra soma sacrifice.
