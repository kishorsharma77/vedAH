In c note the phonetic figure vibhúr víśvasmai bhúvanāya, with the two elements of the first word distributed over the next two.

Note that Agni here is said to have “two mothers” (dvimātā́), while in vs. 4 he swells in his “two fathers” (pitróḥ; see also 9a) -- in both cases referring to the kindling sticks. Although both “two mothers” and “two fathers” can refer pregnantly, as it were, to a mixed gender set of parents, it is striking that both are used so close together here, and of the same referents.
