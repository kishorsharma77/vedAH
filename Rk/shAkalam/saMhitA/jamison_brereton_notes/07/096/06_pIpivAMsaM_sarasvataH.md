The acc. phrase in ab pīpivā́ṃsam … stánam is the object, or one of the objects of bhakṣīmáhi in c, which makes the rel. clause yó viśvádarśataḥ, referring to the stána-, technically an embedded rel. But as we have often seen, nominal rel. cl. -- pseudo-izafes -- are regularly found embedded.

The expression “share in the breast” seems somewhat odd, but this “swelling breast” is presumably swelling with the honey and ghee in vs. 5. As noted in the publ.

intro., it is also odd to attribute this breast to the male figure Sarasvant. The more appropriate association between the breast and Sarasvatī is found in I.164.49, a passage adduced by Ge (n. 6ab).
