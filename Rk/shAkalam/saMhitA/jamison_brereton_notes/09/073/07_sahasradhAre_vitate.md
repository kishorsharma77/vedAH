The first hemistich now begins to solve the riddle of the double reference, by situating the poets in (or at) the filter, purifying their speech like the soma streams that cross the filter.

I do not know why the Maruts appear here, esp. as spies - quite distinct from Varuṇa’s spies in 4c, as Ge (n. 7d) also asserts. His reason for bringing in the Maruts is dependent on his musical mode interpr. of vs. 6 and therefore not helpful.

I would change the tr. of svàñcaḥ in d to “of lovely outlook” (from “well directed”). See comm. ad VI.15.10.
