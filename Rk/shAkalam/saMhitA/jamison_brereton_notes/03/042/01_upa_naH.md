The relative clause in c is somewhat tricky. The standard tr. (though Ge hesitates in his n. 1c) take the subject to be soma and take háribhyām with ab, starting the rel. cl. with yáḥ in 2nd position (type “come with your fallow bays to our soma, which is for you and seeking us”). I am reluctant to break the pāda in that way

-- though given ukthébhiḥ at the beginning of 4c, which must go with the preceding
pāda, with a new clause beginning kuvíd, this is not much of an argument. More importantly, since tvám asmayúḥ in the immediately preceding hymn (III.41.7) has Indra as the referent, I am reluctant to have identical asmayúḥ modify soma here.

(Old cites some passages in IX where this adj. does modify soma, but those cases describe the preparation of soma and his/its journey towards us, the priests, whereas here the soma is stationary and Indra is journeying towards it and, as its preparers, us.) My interpr. leaves te as the problem -- where to construe it and whether it can be coreferential with yáḥ. The 2nd question can be answered affirmatively; nothing forbids yáḥ from 2nd ps. reference here. As for the first, I take it with háribhyāṃ, a solution I find somewhat unsatisfying, since possessive genitives are not usually necessary in these situations. But cf. máma in 3a below, also in a situation where the possessor doesn’t need to be overt.
