This last vs. of the Vala section reprises ūrváṃ gávyam from 1b with ūrvā́d gā́ḥ in 6b, both immediately pre-caesura, producing a ring. Thus, the supposedly problematic rel. cl. of 1ab participates in two rings in this brief 6-vs. section, with different parts of the clause in play in the two rings. See disc. ad vs. 1.

VI.17.7-10: An initial phonological sequence unifies this set of vss.: from the 2nd half of 7 through the 1st half of 10 every hemistich begins with ádh (or the variants ád and áh): 7c ádhā(rayo), 8a ádha, 8c ád(eva), 9a ádha, 9c áh(im), 10a ádha.
