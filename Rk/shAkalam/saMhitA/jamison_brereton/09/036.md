Soma Pavamāna
Prabhūvasu Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
The hymn begins with a noble image of Soma as a racehorse racing to the finish,  and the second verse contains another equine comparison, though with a more  lowly type of horse. This theme is abandoned until the final verse (6), when Soma  goes seeking horses for the worshipers. The hymn is otherwise a fairly standard  soma hymn, though one might note that the connection of soma with light made in  the previous hymn (attributed to the same poet), IX.35.1, is also found here in verse  3. Also, every verse but the last contains a form derived from the root pū “purify,”  always pāda-initial.

## 1
He has been let loose like a chariot-horse into the filter, pressed into the  two cups.
The prizewinner has stepped upon the finish-line.
## 2
As wakeful draft-horse, o Soma, purify yourself, pursuing the gods,  beyond (the filter),
toward the cask dripping with honey.
## 3
O age-old self-purifying one, make the lights shine forth for us;
impel us toward will, toward skill.
## 4
Being beautified by those who seek truth, being groomed in the
two hands,
he purifies himself in the sheep’s fleece.
## 5
All goods for the pious man—heavenly, earthly, and those of the
midspace—
let Soma bring in purifying himself.
## 6
O Soma, you mount the back of heaven, seeking cows, seeking horses, seeking heroes, o lord of strength.
