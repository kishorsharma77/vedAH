As Hoffmann points out, ví … aurṇot is the only augmented form in the hymn and is esp. striking because it forms a ring with vy ū̀rṇot in 1d. The use of a clear past tense form seems to me to mark the conclusion of the ritual kindling of Agni and the attendant distribution of largesse. In other words, like so many final verses it summarizes the ritual activity whose general description precedes it. The final half-verse, in which Agni decorates the vault with stars, may seem out of place, but it also forms a ring, thematic not lexical, with vs. 1, where Agni approaches heaven and performs his tasks through the nights: the vault (nā́kam) reprises heaven in 1ab, and the stars are appropriate to the nights.

Strictly speaking, rā́yaḥ is acc. pl., not gen. sg. (rāyáḥ), and a more literal translation would follow Ge’s “Er schloss die Reichtümer, die Töre (dazu), auf,” or - to match my tr. of 1cd and accommodate English idiom - “he disclosed riches, opened wide (its) doors.” However, Old strenuously argues that it should be interpreted as gen., and certainly the idiom rāyó dúraḥ (with the correct accent) is found nearby in Parāśara’s oeuvre (I.72.8) What exactly is meant by Agni’s decorating heaven with stars is unclear.

However, in a similar passage (IV.7.3) Proferes (p. 27) argues that the stars in the sky represent the domestic fires distributed though many households.
