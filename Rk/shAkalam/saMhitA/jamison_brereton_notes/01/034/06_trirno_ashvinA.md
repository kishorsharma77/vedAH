Ge (/WG) take mámakāya as referring to the poet himself (“… meiner Wenigkeit”), with sūnáve in apposition and identifying the poet as the Aśvins’ son (“als (eurem) Sohne”). This is certainly possible and in line with the self-deprecatory use of mámaka- in I.31.11 for the poet-sacrificer’s self-reference. It is by no means necessary, however, and it does introduce extra machinery.
