yujmahe is a famous crux: though it should belong to the well-attested root aor. (seen presumably in part. yujānā́ḥ in pāda a), it has a primary ending and therefore looks like a pres. formation. It has received a plethora of explanations. Ge calls it a non-reduplicated perfect (“Perf. ohne Redupl.”); Whitney (Rts.) simply allows for a root pres. for a few forms, incl. this one, in addition to the standard root aor. Probably the currently prevailing interpr. is Hoffmann’s (MSS 2 [1952/1957]: 130-31 =Aufs. II: 366), that it shows dissimilatory loss of the first nasal from

*yuñjmahe belonging to the nasal-infix pres. Although this explanation has a
plausible foundation (as opposed to Ge’s motiveless non-redupl. pf.), the coexistence of yujmahe with yujāná- in the same verse, and the general trickiness of Agastya’s poetry, incline me to a nonce, contextual explanation. The oddly placed nú ‘now’ (though see 9a) immediately following the verb form and ending the pāda seems Agastya’s signal that he’s twisted and tweaked the aorist to his own ends -- a temporary present. Thanks to JL for assembling the relevant lit. and for illuminating disc.
