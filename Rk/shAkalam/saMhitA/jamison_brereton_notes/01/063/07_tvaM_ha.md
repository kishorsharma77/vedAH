“one after the other” is my attempt to render an “object-distributive” value for the intensive dardaḥ. (For this notion see Schaefer 1994: 86-87, though she considers dardar- lexicalized and does not attribute this sense to it, pp. 135-36.) The use of várg ‘you twisted’ differs in tone in simile and frame. In the frame it is distinctly hostile and destructive, but in the simile it simply expresses the ritual action of twisting the barhis grass into seats for the visiting gods.
