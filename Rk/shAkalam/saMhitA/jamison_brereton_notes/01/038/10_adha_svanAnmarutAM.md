title = "10"

Ge (WG) takes the sádma phrase as a parallel subject to mā́nuṣāḥ (requiring a sg. form of reja- to be supplied), but an acc. extent-of-space interpretation works just as well, without needing an extra verb. So also Re.

The last three verses (7-9) describing the thunderstorm are all couched in the present tense, so the augmented imperfect árejanta is somewhat surprising. Vs. 10 does begin a new tṛca, however.
