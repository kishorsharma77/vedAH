This verse cannot be a single clause (as Re, WG seem to take it) because the finite verb sṛjat in d lacks accent, while hí in the first pāda should induce accent on the verb. But if we separate the last pāda from the rest, there is no main verb, just the pres. participles vināśáyan and kṛṇván. Although present participles are rarely predicated (as opposed to past participles), there are cases of such predication (pace Lowe 2012), and I consider this one of them. In fact I connect the first three pāda of this verse with the preceding verse, 5cd - with 6abc giving the reasons why the people trust Indra - and the present participles in some sense reflect the intensive (that is, iterative-frequentative) participle of 5d: he “is doing” rather than “did/does” the actions; they are repetitive and ongoing.
