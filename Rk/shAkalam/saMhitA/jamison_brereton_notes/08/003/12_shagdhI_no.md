Ge’s interpretation of ab (“Tu uns, was du kannst, für diesen, der [den Preis] der Dichtung gewinnen möchte, da du ja dem Paura beigestanden hast”) is syntactically quite troublesome, in that it not only involves an embedded relative (rare to non-existent in the RV) yád … ā́vitha, but one that splits up a close constituent asyá ... síṣāsataḥ. Old, by contrast, takes dhíyaḥ as object of ā́vitha parallel to paurám and cites abundant parallels for √av + dhíyam, -aḥ. This allows the yád clause to be normally positioned, although I still find the position of the asyá unusual. I also supply a presential form of √av to govern dhíyaḥ, since the aid to the striver’s insights seems to be a matter of current concern.

Unlike Ge I do not take svàrṇaram as a fourth client of Indra’s, but as an epithet of the final name in a classic Behagel’s Law construction. In the next hymn (VIII.4.2) mentioning Ruśama, Śyāvaka, and Kr̥pa there is no Svarṇara. I also take it as an epithet in VIII.12.2, but as a PN in VIII.6.39.
