This is the central vs. of the hymn; in it Viśvāmitra practices the kind of praise poetry that the rivers will ask him to reproduce in perpetuity in vs. 8, couched in high formal style. In fact it can be seen as a variant of the opening of the great Indra hymn I.32.1: índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi prá vocaṃ, yā́ni cakā́ra … Here we have the gerundive pravā́cyam for prá vocam, vīryàm matching vīryā̀ṇi, índrasya as in I.32, and the nominalization kárma for the pf. cakā́ra. The serpent, the mace, and the signature verb √han are then found in the rest of b and in c, as they are in I.32.1. As Watkins points out (Dragon, 309), here the verb √han has been displaced from its standard formulaic role, with áhim as object, to an adjacent part of the myth. Watkins also points out (86 n. 2) that there is “a veritable constellation of inherited words and roots relating to poetry in this passage” (apropos vss. 7-8).

Note the etymological and phonetic figure ā́yan … áyanam in d.
