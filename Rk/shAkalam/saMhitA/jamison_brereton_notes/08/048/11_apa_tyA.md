ánirā- is lit. ‘want of nourishment’. Since írā- sometimes seems specialized for liquid nourishment, I considered ‘thirsts’ here, and indeed in VIII.60.20, conjoined with kṣúdham ‘hunger’, ‘thirst’ works well. But in this passage such a translation sounds as if it refers to desires or cravings, and I think the passage refers to external threats rather than those generated within the person.
