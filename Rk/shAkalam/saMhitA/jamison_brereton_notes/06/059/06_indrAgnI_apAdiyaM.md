The fem. footless (apadvátī) and footless (padvátībhyaḥ) are most likely Dawn and her cows, either the rays of light that are the Dawn cows or the real cows that go to pasture at dawn. Cf., with Ge, I.152.3. She appears here presumably to mark the dawn worship where the ritual fire is kindled and Indra appears.

Both Ge and Re divide the 2nd hemistich between Agni (c) and Sūrya (d). I am in full agreement that c belongs to Agni, describing the spread of his flames and crackling of the new fire. But I do not follow their assignment of d to Sūrya. Since the hymn is dedicated to Indra and Agni, we would expect the paired god to be Indra, not Sūrya, who has no place in the hymn. And it easily applies to Indra, as long as we interpr. padā́as an instr. sg. of ‘foot’. Cf. with the same phrase, incl. the same verb, I.51.6 ... arbudáṃ ní kramīḥ padā́“With your foot you [=Indra] trampled down Arbuda” and, with a diff. root but the same preverb, also of Indra, VIII.64.2 padā́ paṇī ́ m̐r arādháso, ní bādhasva “With your foot stamp down the ungenerous niggards.” Ge and Re take padā́as neut. pl. to padá- ‘foot-step’, construed with triṃśát as a measure of the distance that Sūrya has crossed. I don’t know why they feel the need to introduce Sūrya here -- I suppose because of Uṣas in ab.

With Ge I take cárat as a finite verb, an injunctive, accented because it’s implicitly contrastive with the next clause.
