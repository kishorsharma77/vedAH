Indra  
Nara Bhāradvāja  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Unlike the last hymn, which calmly contemplates the good our praise is doing for  Indra, this hymn inquires impatiently about the reward we should receive for this  activity, a mood conveyed by the peremptory questions of the first three verses and  the commands of verse 4.  
The final verse (5) is syntactically very difficult and has given rise to a variety of inter pretations, especially of the first half-verse. We consider it a reference to the Vala myth  (as is clear at least in the mention of the Aṅgirases in d and also probably of the doors  in b): the poet hopes that the mythic opening of the Vala cave and the good things that  emerged from it will serve as a model for Indra’s wished-for bounties now. The “com munity” is probably both the poet’s own people and the Aṅgirases as comrades of Indra.
