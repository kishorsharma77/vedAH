WG take Trita as the persona of the 1st ps. speaker of astoṣi (“ich, als Trita …”), whereas I follow Ge and Re in supplying a 3rd ps. form of √stu for b.

The form etárī is, of course, problematic, but is most likely a loc. sg.; for disc.

see Tichy (-tar-stems, 59-61). It is found only here and in VI.12.4, in the same pādafinal phrase etárī ná śūṣaíḥ. In our passage there is some phonetic justification for the form (though not in VI.12.4); note the ni/ri sylls: gr̥nīté agnir etárī ... / ... ní riṇāti.
