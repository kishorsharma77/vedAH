√vañc means ‘move crookedly, meander’, but encompasses a number of different types of such motion, including circular or wave-like motion. Here I think it refers, rather charmingly, to a bending, curling movement made in order to come out of a small opening. (English ‘scrunch’ might be accurate, but is also inelegant.) The poet’s heart is thus configured as a smallish container from which his thought must gracefully exit -- a characteristically female gesture perhaps. I very much doubt that she is galloping, à la WG.

The publ. tr. should be altered to “when being recited” to reflect the present participle and to match the identical phrase in 2b.
