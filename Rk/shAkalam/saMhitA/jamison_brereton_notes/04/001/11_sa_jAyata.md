The vs. treats the birth of the ritual fire on earth, with the second hemistich describing the amorphous shape and constant motion of physical fire. That it has neither foot nor head (apā́d aśīrṣā́) presumably refers to the lack of consistent vertical definition of a flickering fire; “concealing its two ends” (guhámāno ántā) is reminiscent of 7c “enveloped within the limitless” (ananté antáḥ párivītaḥ), and the explanations suggested there may apply here. In addition, the “two ends” may be the non-existent foot and head just referred to.
