Ge tr. vidáthe as “den beiden gelehrten Stände,” commenting (n. 1de) that vidátha- “ist die Autorität in gelehrten Sachen.” Following Thieme (Unters. 37ff.; see also EWA s.v.), however, I take the stem as derived from ví √dhā ‘divide, distribute’. In most instances (esp. in the loc. vidáthe, identical to the form here) vidátha- refers to the ceremonial distribution of goods and, more loosely, to the ceremony itself, but it can also refer to cosmic divisions (for other passages see Thieme’s collection; one ex. is 9b below), and that is the referent here. The presence of ubhé helps mark the form as a neut. dual, as opposed to the otherwise ubiquitous loc. sg.
