In addition to the introduction of Savitar, we also get a slight rearrangement in word order. The conjoined phrase pavítreṇa savéna ca would not fit in the slot right before the impv. in c, a position it occupies in 23c, 24b, 24c, 26c, so the final enclitic naḥ is converted to a full prn. mā́m and placed in initial position. This prn. also has to be read as distracted máām to achieve 8 syllables. I wonder why the poet didn’t just use asmā́n, which would fit the meter and better match naḥ. One of the only instances in which I think I could compose the vs. better than the poet - though “me” (both tonic mā́m and enclitic mā) serves as insistent obj. in vs. 27.
