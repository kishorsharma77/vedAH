The 2nd hemistich has been variously interpr. Most recently WG take the neut.

pls. víśvāni … sudínāni … dyumnā́ni as subjs. of the sg. verb dyaut, in the wellknown, inherited, but relatively rare constr. of neut. pl. + sg. verb (“Zu ihm strahlen alle …”). Re takes all of the half-verse through aryáḥ as nominal sentences: “que tous (les jours) soient de beaux jours pour lui …,” and the rest of d as an abrupt command. Ge has Agni shining the various good things through the doors to the fortunate asmai. My interpr. is closest to Old (Noten, not SBE) and Ge’s alternative in his n. 6cd. I take ví dúraḥ as referring to the usual opening of the doors, an expression that usually contains a form of the verb √vṛ ‘(un)cover’ (e.g., IX.45.1 ví … dúro vṛdhi). Here the more dramatic verb dyaut has been substituted, blending the lexeme ví … dyaut ‘flashed forth (like lightning)’ with the straightforward ví √vṛ ‘open’ -- hence my “flashed open the doors.” I am not sure why all the standard tr.

(except for WG) render the injunctive dyaut as a modal (e.g., Ge “… sollst du … scheinen”).

I supply ‘days’ with sudínāni on the basis of passages like VII.11.2 áhāny asmai sudínā bhavanti.

rāyáḥ can be either acc. pl. (so Old, Ge, Re) or gen. sg. dependent on víśvāni … sudínāni (so Th [Fremdl. 61] “All die Sonnentage des Reichtums,” WG). In the publ. tr. I took it as acc. pl. but, to my mind, nothing rides on it either way.
