All Gods
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
9 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 9
In this hymn as in the last one it is clear that Gotama did not reserve his best efforts  for All God hymns. With its elementary phraseology and patterned repetitions this  hymn is blessedly easy to read but offers little of interest. It falls into three clear  parts, which may well have been originally separate (though the hymn does not dis
turb the pattern of hymn arrangement in the Saṃhitā): verses 1–5, 6–8 (these two  segments in the same meter), and 9.
The first segment begins with the principal Ādityas as our guides (vs. 1)  and  touches briefly on their general benefits to mortals in the next three verses. The  final verse (5) is more specifically focused on the ritual interchange: the hymns we offer to the gods should produce cows in return. The next segment (vss. 6–8) sim ply attributes metaphorical “honey” to all natural phenomena, while the last verse  (9) expresses the hope that a variety of gods will be luck or welfare for us. This final  verse is highly reminiscent of a much longer such litany in VII.35.
