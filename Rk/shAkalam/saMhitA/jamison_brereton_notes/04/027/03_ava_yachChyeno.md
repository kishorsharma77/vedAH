This is a difficult vs. to construe and to interpret. What we have to go on is the syntactic skeleton the poet has provided us: a triple yád construction, with yád in Wackernagel’s position in the first three pādas, and in the fourth a nominative NP that serves as the subject of the clause introduced in c. The main cl. is then provided by 4ab (so, generally, Old, Ge, WG, Schneider).

Within this structure pādas a and cd are relatively straightforward internally; it is b that causes further problems, esp. in the sequence … yád yádi vā́ta(ḥ). First, note the mirror-image phonology of the opening: ví yád yádi v(…). Ge takes yádi vā simply as a strengthened ‘or’, and similarly Schneider (16 n. 35) states that yádi vā is simply equivalent to vā. The tr. of Ge and WG reflect this stripped-down interpr. of the sequence yád yádi vā, reducing that complex just to “oder als …” I find this exceedingly unlikely. The sequence is simply too tricky and too unprecedented to be a long-winded way of saying ‘or’, and anyway RVic poets do not resort to pleonastic expressions to fill out their pādas: 11 syllables is too tight a space as it is. I think we must give yádi vā its lexical weight “or if” and assume that the poet is introducing a bit of doubt about some details of the story. This doubt coincides with the switch from 3rd singular reference to the falcon to unidentified 3rd plural: “they carried” (ūhúḥ), and these are likely to be connected. The two almost identical statements about Puraṃdhi (26.7c and 27.2c) simply state that she “left behind” hostilities.

Neither says she was carried away, much less by whom -- so how Puraṃdhi departed remains unclear, and pāda b seems to be reminding us of that.

The similarity of vā́ta(ḥ) (Pp. vā átaḥ) to the word for ‘wind’, just met in vā́tān (2d), has been generally remarked on. Ge (n. 3b) tentatively suggests a haplology: vā́to vā́tā(ḥ), that is, vā átaḥ vā́tāḥ ‘or the winds from there (carried off Puraṃdhi).” I see the temptation, but I think vā́ta(ḥ) is only a word play and does not conceal a form of ‘wind’. Among other things, the winds in 2d were not carrying anything away; they were overtaken by the falcon, who was.
