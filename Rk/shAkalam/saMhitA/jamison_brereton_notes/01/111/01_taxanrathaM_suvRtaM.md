vidmanā́pasaḥ is formally odd, though clear in meaning. Given the independent instr. vidmánā in the preceding hymn (I.110.6), we might expect a phrase *vidmánā *apásaḥ “working with know-how,” with the internally derived apás- ‘laboring’ to neut. ápas- ‘labor’. But though the sandhi would support this interpr., the accents are wrong on both words. For Wackernagel’s somewhat confused treatment of the cmpd., see comm. ad I.31.1. The correct analysis is, in my view, vidmanā-ápas-, a bahuvrīhi built to the neut. s-stem ápas- ‘labor’, work’, with the instr. to vidmán- as 1st member. The 2nd member receives the accent, somewhat unusually for a bahuvrīhi, like some other cmpds. with -as-stems as 2nd member.

Ge refuses to tr. vṛ́ṣaṇvasū, which seems just peevish, given the far more difficult words he’s willing to tr.
