The first hemistich contains two ironic reversals, based on what are presumably personal names or plays on them. In the first pāda yákṣu-, perhaps a pun on Yadu, can be rendered as ‘sacrificer’ (so Schmidt, from whom I adapted the tr.), and he himself becomes the sacrifice, or a part of it: puroḷā́ḥ ‘offering cake’.

The presumed underlying form of this nom. sg., puroḷā́s (also found in III.28.2), is unexpected: to the stem puroḷā́ś- we might rather find *puroḷā́ṭ. See Scar (221) with lit. It is worth pointing out in this case, as well as with equally unexpected sadhamā́s in the next vs., that the final of both forms matches that of sudā́s, our hero the king Sudās, and so there may have been some adjustment in that direction, esp. in a hymn given to phonological manipulation. Unfortunately this doesn’t explain the occurrence in III.28.2.

In b the name of the ill-fated enemy mátsyāsaḥ is also the common noun ‘fish’, and this word should be read in both the simile and the frame. Following Old (and Ge, who adopted Old’s suggestion), I take ápīva as containing not only the particle ápi ‘also’ but also a putative loc. sg. to áp- ‘water’. Although there are vanishingly few singular forms to this stem in the RV, they do exist (also in Avestan). The loc. should also be accented *apí, but in puns accentual fluidity is common. The “fish” pun cries out for the “water” interpr., though Schmidt seems to reject it. He then introduces a pun that isn’t supported by the text, rendering rāyé … níśitāḥ as “hooked on wealth (like fishes on bait).” Though this is appealingly cute, it is hard to push ní √śā ‘whet (down)’ to ‘hook’, and dat. rāyé is also hard to fit into that idiom.

Moreover, (ní) √śā is a sort of signature verb in this hymn; cf. 2d, 11c, 24d, and in particular the positive 2d śiśīhi rāyé asmā́n “whet us for wealth” appears to be the polarized counterpart of our negative rāyé … níśitāḥ. I wish I could find a clever expression to capture the image, but so far I have been unable to.

There is a diversity of opinion on what is happening in d as expressed by the verb atarat. Ge thinks that friend is helping friend, though this requires √tṝ to mean ‘help’, not a usage I’m aware of; Old that the enemy ranks were divided into two parts, both fleeing but one faster than, and therefore overtaking (√tṝ), the other. This seems also to be Schmidt’s view, though his “crossed (overcame)” shows a nonidiomatic usage of English ‘overcame’ (meaning ‘overtook’?). The Old/Schmidt view seems possible, but I interpr. it in the light of VIII.1.4, where I take tartūryante 4 to refer to the crisscrossing movements of people in opposite sides of a conflict. I suggest that here sákhā sákhāyam refers to former comrades who are now fighting on opposite sides and crossing each other’s path in the battle line: the shifting alliances of the participants in the Ten Kings battle are notorious and much discussed (see esp.

Witzel’s treatment cited above).
