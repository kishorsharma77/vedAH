Exactly what atmospheric phenomenon is being described here is not clear.

Ge seems to think that it’s the Maruts who are traveling the path (pánthām … yā́tave “dass sie ihre Bahn laufe”), though his n. 8b seems closer to my interpr. I suggest that it is a post-storm image: the thunderclouds/Maruts part, releasing the sun’s ray and allowing the sun to travel its usual path across the sky. The parting of the clouds is expressed in c, the extending or spreading of the clouds that is accompanied by the beams of the sun. Thieme (Fremd. 112) instead sees the Maruts releasing a ray as the path for the sun to travel: the first ray of morning, which the sun follows. But the Maruts are not dawn gods.

Pāda c is repeated as the final pāda of the hymn (36c).
