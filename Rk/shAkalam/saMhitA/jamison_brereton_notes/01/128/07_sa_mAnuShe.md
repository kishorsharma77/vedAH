jénya- is of unclear formation (see EWA s.v.), and opinion is generally split between a derivation from √jan ‘be born’ (e.g., Gr ‘edel’) and √ji ‘win’ (e.g., WG ‘siegreich’), with EWA tentatively opting for the latter. In contrast, I find that a meaning ‘noble’ vel sim. better fits most passages and consider it a pseudo-gerundive to √jan, built to the zero-grade formant jā- (cf. in this hymn jāyata 1a, ájāyata 4f, g), with the semantic development ‘(worthy) to be born, noble, thoroughbred’; its use with inanimate vásu (e.g., the cmpd. jenyā-vasu- ‘having noble goods’) is simply an extension comparable to English “noble metals” (vs. base metals).
