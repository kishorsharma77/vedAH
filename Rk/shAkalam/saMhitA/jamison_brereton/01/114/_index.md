Rudra
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10–11
A simple but pleasing hymn, characterized by considerable chaining and intertwining  of repeated vocabulary and syntactic structures. The helpful and healing aspects of  Rudra are emphasized—the related words sumatí “benevolence” and sumná “favor”  occur six times in this eleven-verse hymn. His fearsome and angry side is for the most  part downplayed, mentioned in passing in verses 4c and 10a, both beginning “in the  distance.” But Rudra’s possible punitive actions are addressed directly in verses 7–8,  which contain twelve occurrences of the prohibitive negative mā “don’t!”
