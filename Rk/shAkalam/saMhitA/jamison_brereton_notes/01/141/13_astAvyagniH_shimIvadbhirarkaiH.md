The arkaíḥ of pāda a can refer both to the chants of the ritual participants and to Agni’s flames, though only the first sense is registered by most tr. In the second sense the instr. is not an agentive/instrumental phrase with passive ástāvi, but an instr. of accompaniment/description.

The “further forward” (pratarám) of b presumably refers to the installation of the new Āhavanīya fire, carried towards the east. The dádhānaḥ of this pāda forms a ring with dhāyi of 1a.

In cd the mixed 3rd and 1st ps. pl. subject amī́ca yé maghávāno vayáṃ ca “both those who are our bounteous (patrons) and we (ourselves)” takes a 3rd pl. verb, níṣ ṭatanyuḥ. I take níḥ with the frame (“extend outward”) and áti with the simile (“extend beyond”).
