The fingers of the pressers are found both here in pāda a and in 4d, though with different lexical realizations and different functions in the vs. There is also an exact, though mirror-image, responsion: yató nṛ́bhiḥ (4d): nṛ́bhir yatáḥ (7d). On the other hand, hitám in 7b almost surely belongs to √hi ‘impel’, while hitám in 5d belongs to √dhā ‘place, deposit’.
