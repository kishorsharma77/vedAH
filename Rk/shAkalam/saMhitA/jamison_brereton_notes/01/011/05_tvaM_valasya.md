Though it may seem odd that the enemy Vala is called ‘fearless’, the other solution, to take ábibhyuṣaḥ as an “irregular” nom. pl. masc. pf. part. (expect ábibhīvāṃsaḥ) (so Sāy/Old), is not satisfying, esp. as it’s hard for me to see how the gods could be both “fearless” and “being pushed back” (although ET points out that they could have come to Indra’s aid without fear, even though being pushed back).

The question is what syntactic function the gen./abl. ábibhyuṣaḥ is fulfilling. Re seems to take it as a gen. agent with tujyámānāsaḥ (“pressés par le (dieu) sans peur”), but gen. agents are rare and confined to semantically and grammatically specialized situations (see Jamison 1979), and an ablative value “before,” as implied by Ge, seems better. Since expressions of fearing take the ablative, we can even assume an underlying implicit contrast: “the gods, (fearful) of [=from] the fearless one…”
