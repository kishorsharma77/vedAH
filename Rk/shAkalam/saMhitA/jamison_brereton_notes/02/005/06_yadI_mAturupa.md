I take yádī as yád ī, with pronominal enclitic ī standing for ‘him’ = Agni/Adhvaryu. See my “RVic sīm and īm” (Fs. Cardona, 2002).

Ge’s identifications, flg. Sāy., of the mother as the cow and the sister as the offering ladle or, less likely in my opinion, the ghee offering itself, seem reasonable.

He suggests that the pl. tā́sām of c picks up a collective in the previous clause, presumably ghee. This seems less likely to me; I suggest “the arrival of these (fem.)” refers back to the sisters who came here (svásāro yā́idáṃ yayúḥ) in 5d.
