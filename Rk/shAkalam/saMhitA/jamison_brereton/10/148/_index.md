Indra
Prthu Vainya ̥
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn offers some tricky bits of syntax and phraseology in what is otherwise  a standard praise of Indra and request for his aid. The poet seems especially  aware that Indra bestows his aid on those whom he likes (see esp. vss. 1c, 3b,  4c) and so emphasizes men’s need to offer abundant praise and oblations with a  cheerful spirit.
