On the basis of acíttam bráhma in 5c, I tentatively supply bráhma as the referent of etád here, which is the object of ví ciketat, and of tȧd in 3b, the object of ciketa. The web of neut. sg. + √cit is tight in these vss.; note also that our bráhma is touted as the ultimate weapon in the last hemistich of the hymn (7c). Pādas a and b in this verse are implicitly contrastive, so the referent of etád should be something that harmonizes with mántra-, but it cannot be mántra- itself, because that word is masc.

Neut. bráhman- fills the bill.

The gen. pl. eṣām could be dependent on tváḥ ‘many a one’ (so Ge [/WG]), rather than on etád (Old, Re, me). In either case the referent is not clear. If it limits etád, as I think (based partly on tád vām 3b; so Old), then it may refer to the gods, esp. Mitra and Varuṇa, or to mortal poets inspired by the gods, in contrast to the hapless ‘scorners of the gods’ (devanídaḥ) in d. If it is dependent on tváḥ I assume it refers to the general run of clueless mortals. As argued in the publ. intro., I take ab to mean that, whether or not it is comprehensible to ordinary people, speech properly pronounced by poets comes true.

Whether the four-edged and three-edged weapons have precise referents is not clear. Old and Ge [/WG] state that cáturaśri- is used of the vájra- in IV.22.2; this is actually conjecture and probably false. The bahuvrīhi cáturaśri- is used without a head noun in IV.22.2a, as the object of the part. ásyan ‘hurling’ (or ‘shooting’). The next verse contains a form of vájra- (3c), but the context is not a direct restatement of 2a; in other words, the two words need not have anything to do with each other.

Closer to the occurrence of cáturaśri- in 2a is áśman- ‘stone’ in 1d (i.e., the pāda immediately before). Since stones can be hurled (cf. I.172.2 āré áśmā yám ásyatha) and I know of no passage where the vajra is, if cáturaśri- has any clear referent in IV.22.2, it is probably the stone, not the mace. It is perhaps worth noting that IV.22.1c contains a string of words referring to ritual speech: bráhma stómam … ukthā́, which suggests at least an indirect connection between ritual speech and the four-edged weapon, as here. This leaves the three-edged weapon. Does it have a precise reference (say, a trident associated with non-divinities) or is the poet simply expressing the truism that higher numbers beat lower ones and four edges is better than three?
