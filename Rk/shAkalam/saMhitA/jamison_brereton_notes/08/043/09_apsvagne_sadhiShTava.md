Assuming with the Pp., Macd. (VGS §48a), and Lub (s.v. sá) that saúṣadhīḥ represents sá(ḥ) óṣadhīḥ, this sandhi contravenes the standard treatment; cf. I.103.5, X.88.10 sá óṣadhīḥ. The sá with 2nd ps. reference also does not conform to my rules for this usage, as it is not in an imperatival clause. I do not have an answer, though poetic factors may have had some influence: note the preceding pāda (ap)sú ... sádhi(ṣ) …, which is a good match for the three syllables in saúṣadhī(r).
