This vs. is identical in conceptual structure to 19. The first hemistich expresses the 1st-ps. speaker’s constant close relationship to Soma, using the word sakhyá- ‘fellowship’ and an “every day” expression (divé-dive in 19b, náktam utá … divā́in 20a). The 2nd iteration is more intimate than the first: in 19 the poet simply rejoices in his fellowship, but in 20 he is “at your udder for fellowship” (sakhyā́ya … ū́dhani, suggesting a mother/child suckling relationship.

As for this ū́dhani: because this occurrence is followed by the phrase ghṛṇā́ tápantam “scorching with its heat” and because ū́dhar / ū́dhan- is found in V.34.3 in opposition to ghraṃsá- ‘heat’, Re suggests that the two passages need to be interpr.

in conjunction with each other. For Re this means rejecting the existence of an independent (ū́dhar /) ū́dhan- meaning ‘cold’ (accepted by Ge, EWA, and me), since ‘cold’ does not work in our passage. But I do subscribe to the two ū́dhan- view—see comm. ad VIII.2.12—with the one here belonging to the dominant ‘udder’ stem. I simply consider the mention of scorching heat in the next hemistich to be coincidence.

The 2nd hemistich matches that of 19. In 19 the poet complains about his afflictions and then invites Soma to pass beyond the barriers. In this vs. the escape presumably effected by Soma in 19 provides the model for the one made by “us.” Just as Soma was to go “beyond the barriers” (paridhī́ṃr áti) so did we fly (paptima) “beyond the sun” (áti sū́ryam)—far beyond it (párah). The sun scorching with its heat, described in c, corresponds to the many things that got me down in 19c, and in both d pādas these troubles are overcome, passed beyond. Soma’s presumably successful journey beyond the barriers—barriers that are probably ritually related (see above)—makes it possible for us to overcome our own difficulties with triumphant flight.
