On the anomalous form trā́sīthām see Old. Whatever its morphological status otherwise, it is clearly a dual, and therefore, strictly speaking, only dyā́vābhūmī can be its subj., not the additional voc. adite.

Since pāda b is a repetition (=VII.62.4), Ge interprets it as parenthetical, with pāda c continuing pāda a (“who is the protector and defender … from the stronger mortal”) (so also Bloomfield, RReps). This is not impossible, but since the abl.

phrase in c can just as easily be construed with the verb in b, I see no reason why the repeated pāda can’t have been stitched into the fabric of this vs. (Re and WG both take c with b, as I do.) With Ge, I take vaḥ as a dat. of benefit: the wide space is made for the gods (see also Oberlies, Relig. des RV I.461). Re and WG construe vaḥ with káḥ (“which among you?”), and WG specifically indicate that the wide space is made for us by one of the gods. Although the identical phrase kó vaḥ opening pāda a favors this latter interpr., I follow Ge, in part because I think whoever would be acting thus at the ceremony would be a human ritual officiant.
