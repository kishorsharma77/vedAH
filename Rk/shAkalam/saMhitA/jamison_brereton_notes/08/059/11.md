A verb like ‘bring’ needs to be supplied with the first hemistich based on the numerous passages containing ā́bhara governing no rayím (e.g., I.79.8 ā́no agne rayím bhara); cf. also 18cd below. On upamāte see VIII.40.9.

The publ. tr. “very glorious” is a careless error for “self-glorious,” misreading sváyaśastaram as *súyaśastaram. I am evidently not alone in this, as the SV reads this instead. If this were the correct reading the accent should probably have been

*suyáśastaram, given forms like suśrávas(-tama)-.
