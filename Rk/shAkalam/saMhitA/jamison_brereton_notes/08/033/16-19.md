As discussed in the publ. intro., in my view this strange pendant to the hymn is an oblique attack on what I consider a late RVic ritual innovation, the introduction of the Patnī, Sacrificer’s Wife, as a required role in standard ritual. For both general discussion of this situation and some detailed consideration of passages throughout the RV, including this one, that fight this doctrinal battle, see Jamison 2011 “The Secret Lives of Texts” (Presidential Address, American Oriental Society 2010; JAOS 131: 1-7) and “‘Sacrificer's Wife’ in the Rig Veda: Ritual Innovation?” (Brereton and Proferes, eds., Creating the Veda, Living the Veda: Selected Papers from the 13th World Sanskrit Conference, 19-30). The division of speakers, again in my view, is that the poet, who opposes the new ritual model, speaks the first (16) and last (19) verses, while 17-18 are put in the mouth of Indra, who is a proponent.

These verses are extensively discussed by Old and Ge, with Old somewhat more in line with my own interpretation; I will not consistently signal my agreements and disagreements with them in what follows.
