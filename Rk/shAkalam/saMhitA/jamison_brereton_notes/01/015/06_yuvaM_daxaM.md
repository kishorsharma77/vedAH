The voc. dhṛtavrata ‘of steadfast commandments’ is apparently a singular in the Saṃhitā text, though the Pp. reads -ā. There is, however, no sandhi situation that could have triggered a shortening of the final vowel. Although the epithet is several times found in the du. modifying Mitra and Varuṇa (VIII.25.2, 8), it is more often in the singular modifying only Varuṇa (e.g., I.44.14, 141.9), and this may have been the intent here. The vratá is really Varuṇa’s province, not Mitra’s. However, the matter is complicated by the fact that the clear dual dvandva voc. mítrāvaruṇa in b also has a singular ending, rather than expected -ā.. I would attribute this shortening to an attempt to match the short final of sg. dhṛtavrata, rather than assuming the shortening affected both words for the same reason. Alternatively, as JL points out to me, it would be possible to consider the final short vowel of dhṛtavrata an example of Kuiper’s Law, with loss of final laryngeal in pausa, though this could not account directly for the following mítrāvaruṇa, which is the real problem.
