For the third time in this hymn a pāda-final acc. pl. might more comfortably be interpreted as a gen. pl. -- here nṝ́n. In the cases of mártān in 3d and 11b we saw that the acc. pl. reading was easily possible and an abbreviated (or re-formed) gen. pl.

interpr. was unnecessary. Here an acc. pl. interpr. seems more difficult, though perhaps not impossible. If it is a gen. pl. the tr. would be “as the foremost ritual adepts of/among men,” and most interpr. implicitly or explicitly accept this analysis.

(See also disc. in AiG III.119 and Old, ZDMG 55: 285-89 [=KlSch 744-78], though Old in the Noten favors a nominative pl. analysis, also by preference ZDMG 55: 287 [=KlSch 746].) Certainly nṛ́̄n appears to be more multivalent in the RV than other acc. pl., and, though reluctant, I cannot rule out a gen. pl. However, I think it is possible that nṛ́̄n is a rough acc. of goal (“born to men”) or respect (“ritual adepts with respect to men”).

Interestingly, here “we” aspire to a complete set of parents: Mother Dawn, Father Heaven. Generally in the RV a single parent will do in any particular rhetorical situation.
