I do not understand the participle sán in c. It does not have concessive force, nor does it serve (like sántam 7c) to anchor an unclear gender assignment. It may convey something like “since you are a god / in your capacity as god,” though this hardly seems necessary to express of Indra, whose divinity isn’t in question here.
