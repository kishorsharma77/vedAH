Unlike most -hán- cmpds, whose 1st member is the target of the smiting, in śarya-hán- the 1st member śarya- ‘arrow’ must be in an instr. relationship with the 2nd (see Scar 693), like muṣṭi-hán ‘smiting with the fist(s)’. Because “like a powerful shooter with arrows / one who shoots arrows” is exceptionally awk in English, I’ve substituted ‘sharpshooter’, though it interferes with the tigmá- in tigmá-śṛṅga- ‘sharp-horned’ in the next pāda.
