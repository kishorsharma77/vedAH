The adj. áyohata- ‘metal-hammered’ occurs twice in the RV (also IX.80.2), both qualifying yóni- ‘womb’ and referring to something that contains soma. Old suggests that it refers to a wooden vessel that has been hewn out by a metal blade.

What the instr. drúṇā is doing here is unclear to me. This instr. appears 5x in the RV; in the two passages outside of the Soma maṇḍala (V.86.3, VIII.96.11) it appears to refer to an implement with which one accomplishes something -- in the latter passage a paddle to propel a boat to reach the far shore. Of the two other passages in IX, IX.65.6 drúṇā sadhástham aśnuṣe is quite similar to this one: “you attain to your seat drúṇā,” and in 98.2 índur abhí drúṇā hitáḥ, which lacks an overt ‘seat’, the interpr. depends on which root hitáḥ is assigned to: √dhā ‘place’ or √hi ‘impel’. In all three soma passages I take drúṇā as an implement (a wooden vessel or even a pusher, a paddle) that allows soma to attain its place or (in 98.2, taking hitá- to √hi) to be impelled on its way. This is not the standard interpr.; most (see, e.g., Old’s disc.) take it as referring to the wooden cup or vessel that constitutes soma’s “seat” (e.g., Ge “an seinen Platz aus Holz”), but the instr. in such an interpr. is troubling. Re remarks “Instr. un peu rude pour d° kṛtám” and renders (ad IX.1.2)  65.6 as “placé (sur la cuve faite) en bois.” Though he further remarks “on ne peut parler qu’avec réserve de l’Instr. de matière en véd.,” an instr. of material is essentially the standard interpr. of drúṇā in this passage -- one that I would prefer to avoid, though perhaps at the expense of inventing another implement in the soma ritual.
