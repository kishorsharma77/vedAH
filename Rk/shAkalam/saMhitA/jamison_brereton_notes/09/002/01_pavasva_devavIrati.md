As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn begins with the quintessential command of the Soma maṇḍala: pávasva ‘purify yourself’, found in the previous hymn at the beginning of the 2nd pāda (IX.1.1b).

The 2nd word devavī́ḥ ‘pursuing the gods’ also matches up with the previous hymn:

> 1.4
devā́nāṃ vītím.

The expression “across the filter” is iconically split across the pāda break: áti, pavítram.

The last pāda consists of a neat double figure índram indo vṛ́śā́viśa. The play between índra- and índu- ‘drop’ is ubiquitous in the IXth Maṇḍala and is in fact reprised in 9a indav indrayúḥ.
