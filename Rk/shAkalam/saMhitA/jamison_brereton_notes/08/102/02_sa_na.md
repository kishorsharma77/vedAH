The standard interpr. are agreed that the referent of the fem. instr. phrase ī́ḷānayā … duvasyúvā is some form of speech. This makes sense and is certainly not excluded. However, the only other fem. form of the participle ī́ḷāna- in V.28.1 refers to the ghee-filled offering ladle, and I therefore prefer that interpr.
