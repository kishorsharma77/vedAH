Ge takes tatane as a preterite (“… habe ich … gespannt”), but the fullgrade root syllable should signal a subjunctive, which also fits the context better (opt.

daśema [b], subj. śṛṇavaḥ [d]). In contrast Kü (210) considers the form a properly formed indicative and a relic, the regularly developed product of *ta-tn-̥ h2ai; although this could be possible, it seems unnecessary, given that the context favors a modal form.

Note that the hemistich finals dāśema (b) and hávemā́(d) rhyme, though they are morphologically entirelhy distinct.
