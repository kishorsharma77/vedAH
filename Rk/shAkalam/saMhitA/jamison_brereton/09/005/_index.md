Āprı̄  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
11 verses: gāyatrī 1–7, anuṣṭubh 8–11  
An interesting hybrid: the poet has taken the strict patterning of the Āprī hymns of  the animal sacrifice, in which each verse contains a key word or phrase (italicized  in translation) and the verses appear in the same order, and adapted it to the Soma  Pavamāna genre. The same key words are found in the same order, but they are  no longer directly addressed to or descriptive of a series of different divinities and  divinized ritual elements. Instead Soma is sometimes identified with the divinity  

of the original Āprī verse (vss. 2, 7), or characterized by the epithet used for that  divinity (vss. 1, 3), or, most often, he manipulates the divinized element (vss. 4, 5,  10) or associates with the Āprī divinity at the sacrifice (vss. 6, 8, 9, 11). Each verse  contains a form of pávamāna “self-purifying” to anchor the Āprī structure to the  soma context.
