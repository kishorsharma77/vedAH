And yet again we have a form that would be best interpr. as a genitive pl., but formally is not -- devā́or devā́ḥ [so Pp.] in devā́jánimā (cf. devā́nām … jánima [or jánimā] in the next vs., 18b). It would be possible to interpr. devā́ḥ as nominative subj. in the simile (“as the gods do metal”); on the other hand, reading devā́, some have taken it as a neut. pl. adj. with jánimā. Here, however, I think a gen. pl. interpr.

is the correct one, but the poet is playing a little trick: the sequence ná devā́is to be flipped to *devā́na à devā́nā(ṃ). The occurrence of the expected phrase in the next vs. would be an example of immediate poetic repair (see my 2003 “Poetic 'Repair' in the Rig Veda”).

The standard tr. take śucántaḥ as transitive, with agním as obj., but as most comment, verb forms to this root are otherwise intransitive; see esp. identical śucántaḥ in nearby 15d. It seems better to interpr. agním as the obj. of vavṛdhántaḥ along with índram; there is no obstacle to such an interpr. On the secondary present stem seen in the participle vavṛdhánt- here, cf. Kü (471).
