The reference-shifting game continues here and also pulls in some polarized lexical choices. The 1st pl. of vs. 2 becomes the 2nd pl. of the impv. in 3b daśasyata ‘[you all,] show favor’, but a trace of the 1st pl. is left in the enclitic naḥ ‘our, for us’ in 3a. This is the familiar scenario whereby the poet addresses his fellow officiants in the 2nd pl., urging them to do something on behalf of ‘us’ -- with ‘you’ and ‘us’ coreferential but distinguished pragmatically.

Although the identity of the addressees -- the officiants -- and the recipients of their favor -- the gods and their wives -- is ultimately clear, the lexicon complicates this interpr. The verb daśasyá- generally has a god or gods as its subj. and a mortal (vel sim.) as its obj., often naḥ (e.g., VI.11.6 daśasyā́naḥ purvaṇīka hotaḥ “Be favorable to us, o Hotar of many faces [=Agni]”). Here we must reverse the verbal arguments. The 1st object in the 1st pāda, nṝ́n is ambiguous: although it of course means ‘man’ (or ‘superior man’), it is frequently used of gods as well as mortals; it would be possible to interpr. naḥ … nṝ́n as ‘us men’, rather than taking naḥ as a genitive (as I and the standard interpr. do). What helps clinch the divine reference is the 2nd acc. in that pāda, átithīn ‘guests’. This is the only pl. form of this stem in the RV; the sg. forms are exclusively used of Agni, thus skewing the word towards the divine, and of course the model of the sacrifice as guest-reception for the visiting gods is always conceptually present.

The presence of the gods’ wives, pátnīḥ, in b may allude to the shadowy “God Leader” (devá- netár-) who opens (vss. 1-2) and closes (vs. 5) this hymn, since an agent noun to the same root √nī ‘lead’, namely néṣṭar-, is the leader of the wives of the gods and, later, of the sacrificer’s wife in classical śrauta ritual.
