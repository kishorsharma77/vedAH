The utá in the middle of pāda c uncomplicatedly conjoins the temporally contrastive madhyamā́saḥ “the middle ones, those in between” and nū́tanāsaḥ “the current ones” (see Klein DGRV I.301, 311), but the one beginning pāda d, in Klein’s words (DGRV I.382) “introduc[es] a new nonparallel clause.” It is not represented in the publ. tr., which should perhaps read “And … take cognizance of the one who is closest.” The reason for this apparently pleonastic conjunction may be that “the closest one” (singular avamá-) is not only a subset of “the current ones” (plural nū́tanāsaḥ), but the climax of the series of temporally sorted comrades.
