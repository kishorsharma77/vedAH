Agni
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
11 verses: atyaṣṭi, except atidhr̥ti 6
Full of puns, phonological tricks, and syntactic give-and-take, this hymn celebrates  Agni in both his ritual role (e.g., vss. 1–2, 8, 10) and in his physical power (e.g., vss.  3–4, 6). The pleasures of the hymn come more from the interplay of the verbal ele ments than from any sustained thematic development, and in that sense Geldner’s  “gedankenarm” (quoted above) may be accurate, but who needs thoughts when we  have such words?
