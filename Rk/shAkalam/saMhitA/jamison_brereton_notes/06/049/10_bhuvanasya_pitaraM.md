The form vardháyā can be either 2nd sg. impv. (Gr, Ge) or 1st sg.

subjunctive (Re). I opt for the latter, partly because there seem to be no other unambiguous impvs. addressed to priests/mortals in this hymn; the priestly/poetic function is represented by 1st sg. (e.g., stuṣé 1a) and 1st pl. (e.g., huvema pāda d this vs.) verbs. It is also accented despite pāda-medial position, presumably because it lies in the center of a balanced construction: rudráṃ dívā … rudrám aktaú “Rudra by day … Rudra by night.” Given this accented, non-initial, 1st sg. subj., I wonder if vacasyā́in 8a is in fact also a verb (as in my first analysis, represented in the publ.

tr.) and has borrowed its accent from vardháyā.

Despite Ge’ and Re’s comments, considering ‘separately’ (‘allein’, ‘à part’) for ṛ́dhak only to reject it, this must be the correct tr. In his n. 10d Ge cites II.33.4, where we hope not to anger Rudra by invoking him with an invocation shared with another god or gods. See comm. ad loc. The fact that Rudra’s sons are addressed in the next vs. (11), as well as namelessly in 6cd (see above), might make the need for a separate invocation of Rudra all the more acute.
