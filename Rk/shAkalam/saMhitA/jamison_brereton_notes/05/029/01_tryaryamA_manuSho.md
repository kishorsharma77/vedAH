I follow Brereton (Ādityas, 165-66), who in turn followed Thieme (Mitra and Aryaman, 78-77), in taking aryamā́not as nom. sg. masc. (as it is normally and as taken by the standard tr.), but as acc. pl. neut. construed with trī́(like trī́rocanā́in the next pāda). Against Thieme’s “three hospitalities,” Brereton plausibly suggests that in this context the three aryamā́must refer to “what governs the ritual,” perhaps the three soma-pressings or the three fires.

Pāda-initial trī́, found here in a and b, recurs in 7c, 8a, b (also non-initial in 7b).

In c pūtá-dakṣa- (/pūtá-dakṣas-) is ordinarily Ādityan vocabulary (though used of the Maruts also in VIII.94.7, 10). Ge (/WG) supply the Ādityas as the subj. of dhārayanta in b and of course take Aryaman as the subject of pāda a. By contrast, I think the Maruts are subjects of all three pādas -- but they are identified with the Ādityas throughout, as the use of pūtádakṣa-, ordinarily a qualifier of the Ādityas, makes clear.
