What’s going on in this verse is a little baffling, but it seems to concern Indra’s participation in the ritual as a (quasi-)priest-poet, speaking along with the other priests (namasyúbhiḥ)(a) and (b) announcing his own name at that ritual. (That ‘name’ should be supplied here is clear from I.57.3, another Savya hymn, with nā́ma indriyám.) Indra’s “singing along” with the human priests, as it were, is also found in the passages adduced in Ge’s n. to 4a. It is a familiar topic.

Indra also seems to be homologized to soma in the first pāda: the only other occurrence of vacasyate is found in a soma hymn (IX.99.6), where soma “displays his eloquence” while sitting in the cups (camū́ṣu). Our word vána- ‘wood(en)’ is often used in the soma maṇḍala for the wooden cup in which soma is put, and a wellattested formula combines váne, the bull (there =soma), and noisemaking, as here: IX.7.3 vṛ́ṣā́va cakradad váne “the bull has roared down into the wood(en) cup” (cf. IX.74.1, 88.2, 107.22). This superimposition of soma imagery on Indra contributes to the obscurity of this pāda, esp. what “in the wood” means in reference to Indra. Ge (n.

4a) seems to think of a sort of summer camp in the woods for ṛṣis and their families, while Re suggests a “marche” in the forest. I doubt both scenarios, although I do not have a satisfactory solution of my own. If váne … vacasyate evokes the phrase róruvad vánā of the immediately preceding hymn (54.1, 5), it can on the one hand refer to Indra’s loud roar while doing battle in a natural setting; but in a ritual context it might refer to the sacrificial posts or to the wood for the ritual fire, though I am not entirely persuaded by either.

Indra’s benevolent aspect, despite his bullish nature, is emphasized in the second hemistich.
