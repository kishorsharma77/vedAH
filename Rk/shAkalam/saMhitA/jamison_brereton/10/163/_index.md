Against Disease  
Vivrhan K ̥ āśyapa  
6 verses: anuṣṭubh  
Like X.161, this is another charm against disease with Atharvan parallels (AVŚ II.33, AVP IV.7). This hymn provides us with what we might term a body-part  litany. The officiant declares the removal of disease from a series of related body  parts in each verse, each associated with a particular area of the body—another  valuable window on how Vedic peoples divided up and named reality. Although the  names of the more standard body parts (eyes, ears, etc.) are well known and have  well-established cognates, the identification of some of the more obscure terms is  uncertain, though the locational association narrows the range of possibilities.
