As noted in the publ. intro., the question káḥ … varāte “who can obstruct …?” covertly introduces Vṛtra, the defeated enemy who remained unnamed in the first 8 vss., by way of the verb built to the root √vṛ ‘obstruct’ that furnishes Vṛtra’s transparent name. The implicit answer is “no one, since Obstacle himself could not.”
