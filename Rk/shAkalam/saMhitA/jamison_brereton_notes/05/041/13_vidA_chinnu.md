Another opaque vs., whose difficulties begin with the first word vidā́. This is taken as the 2nd pl. pf. by Gr, Ge, WG. (Re unaccountably takes it as a 1st sg. ‘Je sais …’, without comment -- presumably a careless error for véda.) I follow Old in taking it as the instr. of the root noun to the same root.

The phrase yé va évā(ḥ) recurs from 5d though in a different metrical position.

Here as there it refers to the “ways” (évāḥ) of the Maruts (so Ge, Re, flg. Sāy., contra Old’s tentative Ādityas) -- the ways which by our knowledge (vidā́) we are in a position to proclaim (brávāma), presumably in the form of a hymn, for which we expect reward (vā́ryaṃ dádhānāḥ “acquiring what is choice”) -- just as in vs. 5 a visionary thought (dhī́ḥ) was to be produced in return for wealth (rāyá éṣe ávase “for help in the quest for wealth”). The part. dádhānāḥ has almost a purpose function, and to make the reciprocal action clearer I might emend the tr. from “as we acquire” to “while acquiring …” or even “for acquiring.” The first sticking point in the second hemistich is caná. This is universally taken as negative (as caná generally is). However, in this case I think that it is simply equivalent to ca ná (so also Klein I: 289-91 with n. 8) and that the ná here is serving as the simile-marking particle, not the negative. váyaḥ is often used in a simile at the beginning of a pāda: I count 7 #váyo ná passages, incl. V.59.7 in this maṇḍala, where it’s the Maruts who are compared to birds (cf. also I.87.2 #váya iva marutaḥ) — though I do have to admit that 2 #váyaś caná passages (I.24.6, 155.5) contain the negative.

Therefore, contra all the standard tr./interpr., I take the subject of cd not as ‘birds’ (váyaḥ), but as the Maruts compared to birds (like V.59.7, I.87.2). The adj.

subhū́- ‘of good essence’ is regularly used of the Maruts in this maṇḍala (V.55.3, 59.3, 87.3) and would identify them as the referent to an alert audience. In this 2nd half-vs. we make good on our promise to proclaim the ways of the Maruts -- this exploit is one of these ways.

Unfortunately exactly what that exploit involves is unclear. That the Maruts should come down like birds is unproblematic: they regularly fly through the midspace and come down to interact with mortals, generally at the ritual. But the target of their descent, expressed in pāda d, has no parallels, as far as I can find. In my interpr. the mortal (mártam) to whom they come is in distress and receives their help. Unlike the standard tr. I take the hapax root noun instr. kṣubhā́as characterizing the Maruts’ movements (fluttering like birds), not the state of the mortal, which is expressed by ánuyataṃ vadhasnaíḥ “held/controlled by murderous weapons.” I assume that he is under attack by hostile forces and requires the Maruts’ assistance to free him.

The phonological play with va/ā that we noted earlier in the hymn (particularly vss. 1, 5) has returned here: … yé va evā́, brávāma ...vā́ryaṃ ...

váya(ḥ) ... subhvà(ḥ) ... vadhasnaíḥ — which draws attention to the thematic connection between this vs. and vs. 5.
