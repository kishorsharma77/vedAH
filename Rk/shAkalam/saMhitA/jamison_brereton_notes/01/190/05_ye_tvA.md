The standard tr. take pajrā́ḥ as a PN, as it can be elsewhere, but there seems no reason to drag in Kakṣīvant’s kin for vilification, and I prefer taking it as a simple descriptor.

The hapax usriká- is a nice example of a -ka-suffixed form in slangy and deprecatory context. See my article on -ka- (IIJ 52, 2009).

There is disharmony in number between the two hemistichs: the relative cl. in the plural describing the evil rivals is picked up by dat. singular dūḍhyè.

The accent on cáyase is probably due to the following íd, which does condition verbal accent -- though in fewer passages than listed by Gr (s.v. íd 5), since many of his exx. are pāda-initial. It can also be noted here that the verb immediately follows a pāda-initial voc. and is contrastive with ánu dadāsi in c, either of which would also favor verbal accent.
