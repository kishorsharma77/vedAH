With most (Gr, Ge, Re), the publ. tr. takes the hapax páripati- as ultimately derived from √pā ‘protect’, not páti- ‘lord’. However, this analysis has grave formal problems not solved by Re’s cavalier “hapax tiré de pā- … mais influencé, pour la forme, par páti”: it would be quite difficult to get a short-vowel root syllable pafrom √pā by any normal derivational process. I now think that it is a cmpd. of -páti-, even though Wackernagel’s ‘ringsum Herr’ (AiG II.1.260) reflecting this analysis is not terribly satisfactory. My change of heart was occasioned by considering the first verse in the first hymn of the Pūṣan cycle that begins soon after this hymn, VI.53.1, whose first pāda ends pathas pate “o lord of the path.” I would now tr. our passage, “the complete lord of every path.” It might be worth noting that VI.53.1 also enlists Pūṣan’s help with our dhī́- ‘visionary thought’, as here.

Most take vacasyā́as instr. sg. to the -ā́stem vacasyā́- ‘eloquence’, requiring a verb to be supplied (e.g., Ge “(preise ich)”). I instead interpr. it as 1st sg. act. to the denom. vacasya- (not otherwise found accented). There are two problems with my analysis: 1) the other two forms of the verb vacasya- are medial; 2) vacasyā́is accented, though supposedly a main-cl. verb. The first is not too difficult: verbs of proclaiming/praising can be labile with regard to voice. The second is more problematic and might require me to follow the standard view, tr. “(I praise, vel sim.) with my eloquence.” But see disc. of vardháyā in 10b, where I suggest that our vacasyā́here is indeed a verb and has borrowed its verbal accent from vardháyā.

The phrase kā́mena kṛtáḥ is used of Pūṣan also in nearby VI.58.3-4.
