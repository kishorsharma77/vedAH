It is unusual to find a subjunctive nijū́rvāt in a subord. clause whose main cl. has an imperfect intensive (ároravīt). The publ. tr. renders it as “was about to grind down” -- this seems pretty close to target, though I’d probably substitute rather “was going to” -- a past prospective. Sāy. simply glosses with a desiderative jighāṃsatīty arthaḥ. Of course, the -āt isn’t metrically guaranteed and could have been introduced from vájrāt at the end of 9d, so it is possible that the form was simply injunc. níjū́rvat. Nonetheless, though the usage of the subjunctive here is unusual, I think it can be reconciled with the function of the subjunctive more generally. Note that its function is very much parallel to that of the future participle sariṣyán in 7d.

The pf. part. papivā́n would be better tr. “after having drunk.” Both nijū́rvāt and papivā́n are means of indicating anteriority here.
