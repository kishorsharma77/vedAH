Indra  
Saṃvaraṇa Prājāpatya  
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 9  
The first three verses of this hymn urge sacrificers to make offerings to Indra and  promise them a return on this investment of ritual energy, and the preoccupation  throughout most of the hymn is the contrast between the generous and the stingy  and their respective fates (see esp. vss. 5–7). There is a hostile and dangerous edge to  

much of the rhetoric: the punishments Indra metes out to non-givers are described  with gusto.  
But the most curious feature of the hymn is verse 4, where Indra, depicted as  the killer of the father, mother, and brother of an apparently blameless man, not  only feels no remorse (“he does not shrink from his offense”), but expects to receive  offerings from his victim. The word “offense” used here is a rare and charged one  (kílbiṣa): the uncompounded form is found only here in the R̥gveda, and the four  other (compounded) occurrences of it are in late hymns in Maṇḍala X. Our passage  here seems a foreshadowing of a theme in Indra mythology that becomes highly  developed in the middle Vedic period, that of Indra’s offenses or misdeeds, cata logued as a set of kilbiṣāṇi (see Jamison 1991: 64–68), with Indra as the figure of  a warrior run amuck. But the theme seems out of place in the context here, save  perhaps for Indra’s excessively aggressive behavior toward the stingy in other verses.  (The stingy deserve this treatment, however, in the ritual calculus of the R̥gveda; the  man violently deprived of his kin does not.)  
The hymn ends with what appears to be a truncated dānastuti (vs. 9): the poet  praises his apparent patron Āgniveśi Śatri, but no gifts are mentioned.
