This vs. is comparatively straightforward, esp. the first hemistich.

I take téjaḥ in its literal etymological value: ‘sharpness’ à ‘point’, given tigmá- ‘sharp’ in 4a.

In c note the phonetic play of (citrádh)rajatir aratír.

Despite the pāda boundary, I take vér ná as the simile with both c and d, unlike most, who limit it to d. The root √dhraj ‘swoop, soar’ (found in the b.v. citrádhrajati-) is generally limited to birds (cf. I.165.2, IV.40.3) and the wind, and so comparison to a bird here would be apt. Note also that a form of √dhraj and an uncompounded form of pátman- are found together in 7c.

Though most interpr. take aktóḥ as a gen. either with aratíḥ, imposing a forced reading on the latter (Ge “der Lenker der Nacht,” Lü [Philol.Ind. 783] “als Herr der Nacht”), or with a gapped “Agni” (Th [Unters.] “der (Agni) des Nachts”), I think it likely that it is adverbial, as it is two vss. earlier (3c) in the same metrical position. So also Re.

Our druṣádvan-, a hapax, exists beside 2 occurrences of the simple root noun cmpd. druṣád- -- one of which is in an exactly parallel context: IX.72.5 #vér ná druṣád (like our #vér ná druṣádvā). I assume that the extension by the derivational suffix -van- simply serves metrical convenience, since the forms seem identical semantically. Several other -sád- cmpds have the same extension: nṛṣádvan- (1x), pariṣádvan- (1x), and admasádvan-, found once in the very next hymn (VI.4.4), and - van- extensions are not rare in root noun cmpds, esp. to roots ending in -ā, such as vājadā́van- ‘giving prizes’, sahasradā́van- ‘giving thousands’, etc.

The final word of the vs., the b.v. raghu-pátma-jaṃhāḥ, is unusual for the RV in having three full members, as Re notes. He discusses the cmpd at some length and considers it a “conglomérat” of a tatpuruṣa *raghu-pátman- (entirely parallel to raghu-pátvan-) and the attested bahuvrīhi kṛṣṇá-jaṃhas-, tr. “(dieu) au vol rapide, au plumage (noir)” (I.141.7). I see no reason to involve the latter cmpd., detach the (compounded) first member raghu-pátman- from the second, jáṃhas-, and insert a ‘black’ not found in the text to qualify the second member. The English designation “flight feathers” would have the same structure (save for the bahuvrīhi) as raghupátma-jaṃhas-, that is, “feathers suitable/specialized for flight.” Note that in this bahuvrīhi with a cmpd first member, “first member accent” actually falls on the second member of the first cmpd., matching that of the original tatpuruṣa (cf. just cited raghu-pátvan-) -- in other words, when the bahuvrīhi is formed, the internal structure of its first member is no longer visible to the process.
