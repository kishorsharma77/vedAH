As indicated in the publ. intro. to both I.162 and I.163, I take ā́tman- in these hymns as referring to the lifebreath of the horse, as opposed to his sacrificed body; see I.162.20--21. Although ā́tman- can mean ‘self’ in the RV and sometimes perhaps even ‘body’, the contrast between the horse’s ā́tman- and his tanū́- (see I.162.20ab) seems to exclude those meanings here, pace Ge’s “dein eigenes Selbst” and WG’s “Rumpf.”
