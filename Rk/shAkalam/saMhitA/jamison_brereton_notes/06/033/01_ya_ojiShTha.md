The pāda-final dā́svān, to be read with distraction as dáasvān, presumably reflecting a laryngeal hiatus, resonates with sauvaśv(i)yam and s(u)vaśvo in b, despite the different sibilants. The stem dā́svant- (8x) must always be read distracted and presumably reflects, as already indicated by Gr, an underlying s-stem built to √dā, hence in IIr. terms *dáh-as-.
