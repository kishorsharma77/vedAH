This vs. contains two exx. of case disharmony between simile and frame, one each in ab and cd.

Though Gr takes ájā as a 2nd sg. impv., both Ge and Re interpr. it as a 1st sg.

subjunctive, as do I. This would bring the count to three in this hymn, by my interpr.

(8a, 10b, 12b).

This verb takes a straightforward acc. obj. yūthā́‘herds’ in the simile, as well as an adverbial acc. goal ástam ‘home’. But in the frame it lacks an overt obj.: I supply ‘praise’, Ge ‘Lied’, Re ‘mon hymne’. And the goal is the personal dative of the divinity (vīrā́ya, etc.).

The mismatch between simile and frame is greater in cd, and once again the simile is the more straighforwardly expressed. The poet exploits the syntactic ambiguity of intrans./trans. -áya- formations, in the form here of the redupl. aor.

pispṛsati √spṛś ‘touch’, meaning both ‘make X [acc.] touch Y [acc./loc.]’ and, notionally passive, ‘make Y [acc.] touched by X [instr.]’. The simile uses the latter construction: “cause the firmament (acc. nā́kam = Y) to be touched by stars (instr.

stṛ́bhiḥ =X). In the frame the X is the “inspired words” (vípaḥ, acc. pl.) and the Y is the body (tanvì, in the loc., an alternative case to the acc. in this construction). Both words and body are limited by genitives, referring to the poet (vacanásya ‘of the speaker’) and the god (śrutásya ‘of the famed one’). For further disc. of the passage and of the phenomenon in general see my “Case Disharmony.” Our poet further muddies the waters by reversing the more common relationship between forms of √vip and √vac. The stem vacaná- ‘speaking, speaker’, referring to a person, is attested only 3x in the RV, whereas vácas- ‘speech’ is ubiquitous; the root noun víp- ‘inspired (word[s])’ is not uncommon, but is far outnumbered by the stem vípra- ‘inspired poet’. So we might have expected the phrase *víprasya vácaḥ “the speech of the inspired poet” (cf., though not with a gen., VIII.61.9 vípraḥ … vácaḥ), not vacanásya vípaḥ “the inspired words of the speaker.”
