Soma Pavamāna
Trita Āptya
6 verses: gāyatrī
Once again the hymn begins with the soma flowing forth. There is, however, less  emphasis on the physical process of purification, and more on the sounds that  accompany it: verse 4 introduces three voices, which may be the three types of ritual  speech, the r̥c, yajus, and sāman familiar from later śrauta ritual, or may refer to the  priestly formulations (5a), the bellowing of the cows (4b), and the roar of the rush
ing soma itself (4c). The theme continues in verse 5, which also highlights “truth,”  found in verse 2 as well.
The hymn is bookended by watery references: the simile of the waves of water  in verse 1 returns in the final verse (6) as the seas of wealth that soma will produce  for us.
## 1
Forth go the soma juices, attentive to poetic inspiration, like waves of the  waters,
to the wooden (cups) like buffaloes to the woods.
## 2
To the wooden cups they have flowed, brown and gleaming, in a stream  of truth,
to the prize of cows.
## 3
Pressed for Indra and Vāyu, for Varuṇa and the Maruts,
for Viṣṇu, the soma juices rush.
## 4
The three voices rise up, the milk-cows bellow,
and the tawny one goes ever roaring.1264 IX.34
## 5
The sacred formulations, youthfully exuberant mothers of truth, have  lowed to him.
They keep grooming the child of heaven.
## 6
Four seas of wealth for us, Soma, from every direction,
in the thousands—bring these in purifying yourself.
