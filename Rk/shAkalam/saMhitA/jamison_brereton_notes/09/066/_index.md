This is the second to the last of the composite Gāyatrī hymns in this maṇḍala; the last (IX.67) is attributed to a variety of named poets, while the Anukramaṇī assigns this one to śataṃ vaikhānasaḥ “100 Vaikhānases.” Both attributions seems to acknowledge the composite nature of these compositions, as opposed to the previous ones, which have a single poet named for the whole hymn. Still, we would be hard-pressed to assemble 100 Vaikhānases: only one, Vamra, is named in the Anukramaṇī, as the author of X.99, a hymn to Indra, and the patronymic (and its underlying base) are both absent from the RVic text.
