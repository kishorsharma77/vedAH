Rich with phonetic figures: a śavasānā́ya śūṣám; b āṅgūṣáṃ gírvaṇase aṅgirasvát [note that āṅgūṣám participates in both: it rhymes with preceding śūṣám, but its initial matches aṅgirasvát, while gírvaṇase takes up the 2nd syllable of aṅgirasvát]; cd ṛgmiyā́ya, árcāma arkám [this last also a clear etymological figure].

śavasānā́ya śūṣám recalls śávasā śuṣántam of 61.10a in the same metrical position, with our phrase referring to Indra, the one in I.61 to Vṛtra.

The Pp. reads stuvaté in c, a reading that is universally followed. But this dative is awkward: if it is coreferential with the other datives in the verse, it must refer to Indra, and Indra “praising” is an odd concept in a hymn devoted instead to presenting praises to him. Although Indra occasionally joins in the verbal parts of the sacrifice (see above ad I.55.4), he does not ordinarily (or ever?) praise others. Nonetheless, this is Re’s solution: “(dieu) louangeur.” Schmidt (1968, B+I, 163) suggests a variant of this: “den mit guten Liedern (selbst) preisenden,” but self-praise suggests a medial form, not the active we have. If the participle does not modify Indra, another person in the dative needs to be introduced, despite the unlikelihood of a separate dative referent. This is Ge’s solution: “ihn [=Indra], der für den Sänger … zu preisen ist,” construing stuvaté with ṛgmiyā́ya. So also WG with slightly different tr., though both they and Ge consider the “praising” possibility. But the difficulty disappears if, against the Pp., we read instead stuvatáḥ, genitive sg. of the participle, as I do.
