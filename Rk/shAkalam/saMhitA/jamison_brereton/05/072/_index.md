Mitra and Varuṇa
Bāhuvr̥kta Ātreya
3 verses: uṣṇih
In this hymn, which continues the themes and techniques of the preceding hymn, the  poet repeats a refrain that asks the gods to be present and to receive the soma offer ings. In verse 2 of this hymn he does not mention the names of the gods, as he does in  the first and third verses, but rather begins pāda a with vraténa “by your command ment” and ends pāda b with yātayájjanā “who arrange the peoples.” The word vratá is particularly associated with Varuṇa, both conceptually and etymologically, and  √yat “arrange” describes the function of Mitra. Instead of pairing the two names, the  poet has created a chiasmic pairing of the most characteristic functions of the gods.
