Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
15 verses: gāyatrī, probably arranged in trcas ̥
Indra’s help to us, in its manifold varieties, is a major subject in the hymn, which  opens with a question about this help and regularly returns to the topic (vss. 3,  10, 12, 13). Because Indra’s presence is required in order for us to receive his help,

the hymn is also framed as a journey/invitation hymn. The second verse asks  which soma drink will most appeal to Indra, a semi-disguised expression of the  usual worry that Indra will be attracted by rival pressers. This worry seems also to  underlie the difficult second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6), with its condensed phraseology. Here  the poet first calls on Indra to come here (vs. 4), then seems (in our interpreta
tion at least) to chide him slightly for tarrying (vs. 5), but finally announces (vs.  6) that Indra has arrived with both high spirits and equipment. (The references  to the sun in vss. 5 and 6 are opaque, but we tentatively suggest that they refer to  the early-morning soma sacrifice.) In the next tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) the poet seems reas
sured: despite Indra’s wide-ranging travels his generosity never flags and nothing  gets in its way.
In contrast to the middle verses 4–9, the last two tr̥cas (vss. 10–15) are quite  straightforward and characterized by the insistent fronting of the pronoun “us/ our,” which opens every verse, as well as several intermediate pādas (10bc, 12c). The  message is simple: help us and give to us in every way possible, ending with a wish  for fame among the gods, fame higher than heaven itself (vs. 15).
