In b Soma is urged to run for the prize (vā́jam); in c he is then compared to a prize-winning horse (áśvam … vājínam), a nice ex. of how description shades into simile. It is made somewhat more complex by the fact that the simile (probably) surrounds the target ‘you’: áśvaṃ ná tvā vājínam, so that vājínam could technically be part of the frame, not the simile (“… you, the prize-winner, like a horse”), though in fact tvā is in modified Wackernagel’s position. Soma is directly called a vājín- in 4d.
