The qualifier ‘long’ (dīrgháḥ) of wealth in d means, of course, ‘long-lasting’ (just as dīrgháṃ támaḥ [I.32.10, etc.] refers to “long(-lasting) darkness”). However, since it is implicitly contrasted here with ‘broad’ (pṛthu-budhná- ‘having a broad base’), it is clear that the image is one of physical dimensions, not merely temporal ones. And, at least for me, “long darkness” is a more striking verbal formulation than “long-lasting darkness.”
