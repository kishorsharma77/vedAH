The VIth Maṇḍala, attributed to the Bharadvāja clan, contains seventy-five hymns.  The Anukramaṇī identifies the majority of the hymns as products of the epony mous clan poet himself, Bharadvāja, whose patronymic is Bārhaspatya. These  include all of the Agni series (1–16), much of the Indra series (17–30 and 37–43),  the Pūṣan series (53–60), and the miscellaneous hymns to various divinities toward  the end of the maṇḍala (61–74). The composite hymns coming at the end of the  Indra series (44–46, also 48) are ascribed to a different Bārhaspatya poet, Śaṃyu  Bārhaspatya, but since Śaṃyu is a speaking name (“seeking luck,” reinterpreted  from the archaic compound śaṃyóḥ “luck and lifetime”), this name may well be a  nickname of Bharadvāja. The remaining hymns are attributed to several different  descendants of Bharadvāja, all bearing the patronymic Bhāradvāja; these include a  number of Indra hymns (31–36, 47), the All God series (49–52), and the final hymn  of the maṇḍala, the famous weapon hymn (75).
Although the Indra hymns outnumber the Agni hymns, the Indra hymns are,  for the most part, not terribly notable, though deftly executed. By contrast, the  Agni hymns specialize in imaginative descriptions of physical fire, and VI.9, a hymn  ostensibly dedicated to Agni Vaiśvānara, contains one of the most striking medita
tions on the acquisition and employment of poetic craft in the R̥gveda. The hymn  VI.28, interrupting the Indra cycle, contains a charming blessing of the cows, and  the “clan” hymn, VI.48, repays the attention its difficulties demand. This hymn  contains, inter alia, a remarkable, if cryptic, address to the god Pūṣan, and Pūṣan  is an especial preoccupation of the Bharadvāja poets, with VI.53–60 containing the  only sustained cycle of hymns in the R̥gveda addressed to this minor deity. Other  gods, well represented in other maṇḍalas, receive relatively short shrift: there is only  a single hymn to the Maruts (66), two to Uṣas (64–65), and so on.

1 (442) Agni
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
13 verses: triṣṭubh
A rather stately hymn, appropriate for the first in the Agni sequence in Maṇḍala VI.  It concerns only the ritual fire, with almost no mention of its physical substance, and unlike the typical dawn kindling sequence, the hymn depicts the arrival and  installation of Agni as Hotar and, especially, the ritual fire as joint possession  and responsibility of the whole Ārya community, as Proferes (2007:  33)  points  out. As the first hymn in the maṇḍala, it thus establishes an image of a settled and  well-ordered society unified in its devotion to the gods to which the rest of the  maṇḍala will be dedicated.
The arrival and installation occupy verses 1–3; verses 4–8 show Agni’s reach  through the community, from the individual house, to the clan and settlements, and  indeed to all who claim Manu (the first sacrificer) as ancestor. Verses 9–10 detail  the homage and service Agni deserves, and the remaining verses (11–13) the favors  we ask in return.
### 1
You, o Agni, as first minder of this insightful thought here, became the  Hotar, o wondrous one.
You, o bull, made (the thought) into power difficult to surpass, to
overpower all (other) power.
### 2
Then you sat down as Hotar, superior sacrificer, prospering in the  footprint of refreshment, to be reverently invoked.
You are the first that men have followed when they seek the gods,
distinguishing themselves greatly for wealth.
### 3
The wakeful ones have followed (you) when you come with many goods  as if with a troop, (and they follow) the wealth nearby you—
gleaming Agni, lovely to see, lofty, who receives the omentum (of the  sacrificial beast as offering), shining through all the days.
### 4
Pursuing the track of the god with homage, seeking fame, they will attain  fame indestructible;
even the names they have assumed are worthy of worship. They take  pleasure in your auspicious manifestation.
### 5
You do the settlements strengthen on earth; you (do) both of the “riches  of the peoples” [=patrons and singers?] (strengthen).
You, o surpassing one—become a rescuer worthy of note, a father, a  mother forever for the sons of Manu.
### 6
Dear Agni is to be served among the clans. As Hotar he has sat down,  the gladdening superior sacrificer.
You, shining in our house, do we reverently approach, on bended knee,  with homage.
### 7
You do we of good insight implore when you are new, Agni, seeking your  benevolence, seeking the gods—
you led the clans, while shining through the lofty luminous realm of  heaven, o Agni.
### 8
(You do we implore), the sage poet, the clanlord of each and every clan,  the lavishly overflowing bull of the settled domains,
impelling the forward progress (of the sacrifice), prospering, pure—Agni  who deserves the sacrifice, who rules over riches.774 VI.2
### 9
O Agni, that mortal has sacrificed and ritually labored who after  kindling you has achieved your oblation-giving,
who knows his way around the offering with its acts of homage. Just he  will acquire all things of value, when aided by you.
### 10
To you right here, the great one, great honor would we do, with acts of  homage, o Agni, with kindling wood, and with oblations,
with the altar, o son of strength, with hymns, with solemn words. May  we take our place in your auspicious benevolence.
### 11
You who stretch through the two world-halves with your light and who  through (words of) fame deserve to be famed as surpassing,
with lofty substantial prizes for us, with rich ones, Agni, radiate out  more widely.
### 12
O good one, manfully establish for us forever and for our progeny and  posterity abundance of livestock.
Let there be for us many lofty refreshments that keep evil at a distance  and auspicious things bringing good fame.
### 13
Many goods many-fold in their goodness might I attain of you through  seeking you, o King Agni.
For many are the goods in you, o Agni of many favors, for the one who  does (you) honor, since you are king.

2 (443) Agni
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
11 verses: anuṣṭubh, except śakvarī 11
In its first half (vss. 1–5) this hymn echoes the themes of VI.1: Agni as the joint con cern of all the separate units of Ārya society (and indeed of the gods as well) and  the success that attends the man who fulfills his ritual responsibilities to Agni. The  hymn ends the same way (vss. 10–11), with special mention of Agni’s position in the  individual house as well as his role as clanlord. The similarity between beginning  and ending is marked by a signal of ring composition: the god Mitra compared to  Agni in both the first and last verses. Agni is often compared with or identified with  Mitra (“Ally, Alliance”) because of his position on earth as guest and helper of  men, though himself a god, and because, as god, he mediates the sacrificial alliance  between gods and men.
By contrast, the verses in between (6–9) offer a sequence of increasingly dense  and complex images of fire, starting with a simple one of whirling smoke and sun like brightness (vs. 6), but the comparisons in verses 7cd–8 rely on multiple puns  and terse and elliptical phraseology. This middle section sets the stage for the rest  of the Agni cycle with its focus on the physical aspects of fire. 1. You, o Agni, like Mitra are indeed master of the glory belonging to the  settlements.
You prosper fame like prosperity, o good one without boundaries.
### 2
It is you then that the boundaried domains reverently invoke, with  sacrifices and with hymns;
to you drives the prizewinning (horse), avoiding the wolf, crossing (the  mid)space, the one common to all the boundaried domains.
### 3
In concert the men of heaven kindle you as beacon of the sacrifice, when the human race here, seeking favor, has called upon (you) in the  ceremony.
### 4
The mortal who will bring (the sacrifice) to fulfillment with his insight  and will perform ritual labor for you of good gifts,
with the help of lofty heaven he crosses hatreds like narrow straits.
### 5
The mortal who after kindling (you) will achieve the offering to you and  the whetting of you,
he prospers his dwelling place, (so that it has many) branches and
hundred(-year) lifespans, o Agni.
### 6
Your smoke, when it is in heaven, is turbulent in motion, stretched out  (there) gleaming,
for you shine with your body, o pure one, like the sun with its brilliance. 7. For now you are to be reverently invoked among the clans, as our  dear guest,
to be protected like a son who brings delight to the home, (but also) to  be enflamed like a battle-lusty (warrior) in a stronghold.
### 8
For according to your purpose you are anointed in the wood(en cup)  (like soma) [/in your home =hearth] [/driven into the wood(en cup)]  like a prize-seeker who gets results.
(You are) encompassing like a household (that encompasses all its
members) through your independent power; (you are) made to go in  circles like a young steed (being trained).
### 9
You (eat) just these unstirrable things, Agni, like livestock in a pasture. (This is your) principle: that your dexterous (flames?) hew the woods, o  unaging one.
### 10
Because you pursue (your ritual duties) as Hotar in the house for the  clans who perform the ceremonies, o Agni,
make them unified, o clanlord; enjoy (our) oblation, o Aṅgiras.
### 11
O god Agni with the might of Mitra, to us you call the gods, call the  grace of the two world-halves.
Pursue well-being, good dwelling, pursue the men of heaven. May we  cross over hatreds, over narrow straits difficult to traverse.
May we cross over; with your help may we cross over.

3 (444) Agni
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
8 verses: triṣṭubh
The first two verses of this hymn promise success to the mortal who behaves prop erly and performs his sacrificial duties well. With these decorous sentiments out of  the way, the poet can indulge himself for the rest of the hymn (vss. 3–8) in a series  of compressed and vivid images of fire as a natural substance, involving both sight  (esp. vss. 3–5, 8) and sound (esp. vss. 6–7). The almost feverish succession of image  upon image and the contorted phraseology are reminiscent of the depictions of  natural fire in VI.2.6–9, but allowed even freer rein and more space. The hymn ends  abruptly, without the usual prayers for benefits or even a summary verse calling  attention to the praise just offered to Agni. It is a wild, exhilarating, and often baf
fling ride, especially in the original Sanskrit.
### 1
O Agni, he who protects the truth and is born in truth will dwell in  peace; he who seeks you as god will reach broad light,
that mortal whom you, o god, as Varuṇa in concert with Mitra, protect  from narrow straits along with abandonment.
### 2
He has sacrificed with sacrifices, he has labored with ritual labors; for  Agni who brings wishes to success he has performed pious work—
so the displeasure of eminent ones will never reach that mortal, nor will  narrow straits, nor delusion.
### 3
(You) whose appearance is spotless like that of the sun: when your  fearsome insight comes here as you blaze,
rich spoils (become yours), since (you are) armed. (But) on his own this  one here [=you, Agni], born in the wood(s), is sometimes a cozy nest. 4. Sharp is his course, great his form. He will snap with his mouth like a  horse being bridled.
Lolling his tongue out, like an axe (its blade), he makes the wood “run”  like runny stuff [=liquefies it] as he burns.
### 5
He, just like an archer, has aimed (his arrow), about to shoot. He has  whetted its point like a blade of copper—
he, the spoked wheel (of the sacrifice), who is like a bird whose swooping  is brilliant by night, who sits in the woods [/on wood], whose plumage  is (fit for) rapid flight.
### 6
Like a hoarse-voiced (singer), at the dawning of the ruddy (dawn), he  keeps muttering [=crackles] with his flame, he of Mitra’s might,
the ruddy one who (mutters) to them by night, who (mutters) by day to  men—the immortal ruddy one who (mutters) by day to men.
### 7
He whose (roar), like that of heaven, keeps roaring as he does honor,  (that) bull keeps roaring in the tree, in the plants— he who, like a traveler in the (sun’s) heat, going with a swoop, with a  flight, has *stretched with his goods to the two world-halves, who
(thus) have (in him) a good husband.
### 8
Or who (flashes) at his feedings (of fuel) and at the associated chants  [/with his associated rays], (that one) keeps flashing like lightning with  his own tempests.
Or who fashioned the troop of Maruts like a R̥bhu [/craftsman], he,  turbulent and wild, has flashed.

4 (445) Agni
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
8 verses: triṣṭubh
A more conventionally structured hymn than the last two with less knotty phrase ology. It begins (vs. 1) by asking Agni to sacrifice for us today as always, in his  accustomed role (vs. 2). It ends (vss. 7–8) with a statement of our service to Agni  and prayers for benefits. The verses in between (3–6) describe fire in its naturalistic  aspect, as in the two previous hymns but generally in more straightforward terms  (vs. 5 is an exception and has been variously interpreted).
### 1
Just as you, o Hotar, will (always) sacrifice with sacrifices at Manu’s  attendance on the gods, o son of strength,
even so for us today sacrifice in the same way to the same gods—you  willing, to them willing, o Agni.
### 2
Far radiant like a vision at dawn, Agni worthy to be acquired takes  delight in our extolling—
he who through his whole life has been the immortal among the mortals,  their guest who awakes at dawn, the Jātavedas.
### 3
He, whose formless mass [=smoke] they [=mortals] marvel at as the  heavens do, he (then) clothes himself in lights, like the brilliant sun.
He who, unaging and pure, dispels (hatreds), he has pierced the
primordial (establishments) even of the Devourer.
### 4
You, o son (of strength), are eloquent when you sit for your meal. Agni  right from birth has made his own course into his food.
You, o winner of nourishment, establish nourishment for us. Like a king,  you have conquered; you dwell peacefully in a place without wolves.
### 5
He who eats the wild food sharply, like the wind he goes as ruler across  the nights.
May we, who (serve) you, outstrip the hostilities of (ill-)intentions, as a  steed does the (other) “flying” (steeds), as he curves around the curves  (of a racecourse).
778 VI.5
### 6
Like the sun with its radiant rays, o Agni, you stretch through the two  world-halves with your light.
The bright one, anointed, leads (us) around the dark shades with
his flame, like the descendant of Uśij [=fire-priest/poet Kakīṣvant
Dairghatamasa] soaring in flight [=in exhilaration of soma?].
### 7
Since we have chosen you, most gladdening with (your) ray-flames, with  our (chant-)flames, listen hard to us, Agni.
You, Āyu, like Indra by virtue of your power or your divinity, do the  most manly ones fill with benefit.
### 8
Now for us, Agni, pursue well-being and riches along wolfless paths.  Carry us across narrow straits.
Grant these things to the patrons and favor to the singer. – Having good  heroes might we rejoice for a hundred winters.

5 (446) Agni
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
7 verses: triṣṭubh
An unremarkable hymn. It begins “I call for you (all)”—the poet announcing that  he is performing his ritual task for his priestly colleagues. He continues with praise  of Agni and description of his roles, including that of giver of goods (vss. 1–3). The  next two verses contrast the enemy of the mortals present and the punishment he  should receive from Agni (vs. 4) with the pious server and the rewards he deserves  (vs. 5). Two more verses (6–7) urge Agni to perform these tasks.
### 1
I call for you upon the son of strength, the youth of undeceptive speech,  the youngest one, with our thoughts—
the provident one of many choices who sends all choice treasures, the  one without deceit.
### 2
To you, o Hotar of many faces, the sacrificial ones have set goods in  motion at evening and at dawn,
you, the pure one, in whom (all) auspicious things are encompassed, as  the earth (encompasses) all creatures.
### 3
You sat down among these clans here from olden days; by your will you  became charioteer of valuables.
Therefore you send goods in due order to him who does (you) honor, o  observant Jātavedas.
### 4
Whoever at a distance will assail us, whoever close by will be rapacious, o  Agni with Mitra’s might,
with your own unaging bulls [=flames], most scorching one, scorch him  with your scorching heat, o you of scorching heat. 5. Whoever with sacrifice and with kindling wood, who with solemn  speeches and with chants will ritually serve you, o son of strength,
he, provident among mortals, o immortal one, shines out with wealth,  with brilliance, with fame.
### 6
Do this straightaway, o Agni, when prompted: thrust away rivals with  strength, strong one.
When you are praised through the days, anointed with words, then take  pleasure in the singer. Listen to his thought.
### 7
May we attain this desire, Agni, through your help. May we attain  wealth, o wealthy one, which affords good heroes.
May we attain the prize when we seek the prize. May we attain your  unaging brilliance, o unaging one.
## 6 
6 (447) Agni
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
7 verses: triṣṭubh
Most of this hymn consists of a vivid depiction of destructive fire raging across  the earth, though the first half-verse establishes a ritual context and the last verse  (7) begs Agni for wealth. The hymn is full of phonetic and etymological figures,  particularly the last, intensely alliterative verse.
### 1
Forth to the son of strength with newer (speech), with a sacrifice, seeking  a way, seeking help,
he [=the mortal] goes in pursuit—to the heavenly Hotar, wood-hewing,  gleaming but with a black course.
### 2
He is (like) the brightening thunder abiding in the luminous realm, the  youngest one with his unaging, ever-roaring (flames),
the pure one, the latest fire of many, who travels along many broad
expanses as he devours.
### 3
Sped by the wind, your flaming beams, o flaming Agni, spread out wide  asunder.
Powerfully destructive, (like) the heavenly Navagvas, they conquer the  woods, breaking them boldly—
### 4
Your flaming flames, o possessor of flame, which shear the earth— (flames) like unharnessed horses.
Then your flickering radiates forth widely, marshaling itself on the back  of the dappled one [=earth].
### 5
Then the tongue of the bull keeps flying forth, like a cattle-raider’s  missile let loose.
Like the onslaught of a champion is the ardor of Agni. The fearsome  one, difficult to obstruct, fragments the woods.
780 VI.7
### 6
With the radiance of the great goad [=sun] you stretch across the earthly  expanses boldly.
Thrust away fears with your strengths; rapaciously grind down the
rapacious rivals.
### 7
O bright one with bright dominion—(that which is) bright, brightest,  showing brightly to us, conferring vigor:
wealth, glittering, lofty, conferring many heroes—o glittering one, with  your glittering (flames) bind (that) to the singer.

7 (448) Agni Vaiśvānara
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 6–7
The hymn is dedicated to Agni as Vaiśvānara (“belonging to all men”), but the  focus is primarily on his relationship with the gods (see, e.g., vss. 1–2, 4), on his  cosmic reach and cosmogonic powers (see, e.g., vss. 1, 5–7), in which aspect he  is identified with the sun (see esp. vs. 5), and, especially, on his birth: the root jan
“beget/be born” is found in each of the first five verses. It is only verse 3 that depicts  Agni’s relationship with mortals.
### 1
The head of heaven, the spoked wheel of the earth, Agni Vaiśvānara,  born in truth,
sage poet, sovereign king, guest of the peoples—as a drinking cup to  their mouth did the gods beget (him).
### 2
Navel of sacrifices, seat of riches, the great watering trough—toward  (him) did they cry out together.
Vaiśvānara, charioteer of the ceremonies, beacon of the sacrifice—(him)  the gods begot.
### 3
From you is born the inspired poet who wins the prize, o Agni; from you  the heroes vanquishing hostility.
O Vaiśvānara, establish in us goods to be craved, o king.
### 4
Toward you, o immortal one, while you are being born, do all the gods  cry out together as if to their young.
According to your intentions they went to immortality, o Vaiśvānara,  when you came to light in your two parents [=kindling sticks].
### 5
Vaiśvānara Agni, these great commandments of yours no one dares  venture against,
since, while (just) being born in the lap of your parents, you found the  beacon of the days in the (ritual) patterns.
### 6
By the eye of Vaiśvānara have the backs of heaven been measured out,  by the beacon of the immortal one.
On his head alone are all the creatures; like twigs have his seven
outgrowths [?] grown. 7. He, the very resolute one, who measured out the dusky spaces,
(measured) out the luminous realms of heaven—the sage poet
Vaiśvānara—
who extends himself around all creatures, he is the undeceivable
herdsman, the protector of the immortal.
## 8 
8 (449) Agni Vaiśvānara
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
7 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7
Another Vaiśvānara hymn, and the cosmic aspects of Agni (and his double, the  Sun), extensively treated in VI.7, are touched upon (vss. 2–3). Verse 1 strongly  establishes a sacrificial context, however, which returns in verse 4, relating the  primal establishment of the ritual fire. The remaining verses (5–7) beg him for  benefits.
The hymn is also structured by a phonetic figure, the constant repetition of ini tial v- (see, e.g., 2c, 3a, 3c, all beginning with the preverb ví), indexing the epithet  vaiśvānara, a form of which occurs in every verse but 5.
### 1
Of the fortifying bull, flame-red, I now proclaim the might, proclaim the  rites of Jātavedas.
For Vaiśvānara a newer thought purifies itself, gleaming like soma,
(a thought) dear to Agni.
### 2
(Even?) while being born in the highest distant heaven, Agni, as protector  of commandments [=Varuṇa], guarded the commandments.
He, the very effective one, measured out the midspace; Vaiśvānara
touched the vault with his greatness.
### 3
He propped apart the two world-halves, as unerring envoy [/Mitra]. He  made the darkness pregnant with light.
He rolled out the two Holy Places [=world-halves] like skins. Vaiśvānara  assumed all bullish power.
### 4
In the lap of the waters the buffaloes grasped (him). The clans reverently  approached the king worthy of verses.
The messenger of Vivasvant brought Agni hither—Mātariśvan (brought)  Vaiśvānara from afar.
### 5
In every generation, o Agni, establish for the singers glorious wealth for  ritual distribution and a newer (thought).
As if with a metal wheel-rim, o unaging king, hew down like a tree the  one who curses, with your sharpness.
### 6
Among our benefactors, o Agni, uphold dominion, unbowed and  unaging, and an abundance of heroes.
May we conquer spoils in hundreds and thousands, o Vaiśvānara Agni,  with your help.
782 VI.9
### 7
With your undeceivable herdsmen, o object of our quest, protect our  patrons, o triply seated one.
And guard the troop of those who have given to us, o Agni Vaiśvānara,  and extend (their/our lifetime), when you are praised.
## 9 
9 (450) Agni Vaiśvānara
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
7 verses: triṣṭubh
A powerfully enigmatic hymn, in which the poet reflects on the craft of poetry,  worries about his ability to practice it, and, on having received the revelation of  the mysteries from the ritual fire, takes heart and assumes his poetic vocation.  In this progression the hymn is very reminiscent of IV.5, also a hymn to Agni  in his Vaiśvānara aspect and one in which a poet receives his poetic inspiration  from Agni.
The first and last (7) verses establish a ritual context: the fire is being kindled  in the darkness just before daybreak; its light, which dispels the physical darkness,  will be configured as the metaphorical light of inspiration in the rest of the hymn.  Verses 2–3 are responsive verses, with verse 2 couched in the 1st-person singular  voice of the poet. He confesses his lack of knowledge of poetic craft, metaphori
cally expressed as weaving. The burden is all the greater in that he feels pressure to  surpass his father, whose poetic heir he is. On the basis of the second pāda of this  verse, many scholars have interpreted the whole hymn as a depiction of a brah modya, a poetic contest among rival poets, but we see no evidence of a formal  contest here, simply a poet struggling to find his place as a poet within the bardic  tradition.
The response to this verse in verse 3 provides the answer to the poet’s perplex ity: he will learn his craft if he rightly perceives the ritual fire (who is not mentioned  by name). This verse not only provides the answer, but serves as an example of the  poet’s growing skill, for the last pāda of the verse can be read with double applica tion, both to the poet and to Agni. On the one hand, the repetition of “higher” and  “below” from 2cd suggests that the same father-son pair is referred to as there, and  that the poet is asserting that he will indeed obtain the upper hand over his father  from the revelation of Agni. On the other, the pāda can be read as a riddling defini tion of the god Agni himself, who “moves about below” on the human plane, but  “sees above the other” (perhaps the sun, as another form of fire), because he goes  all the way to heaven bearing men’s oblations to the gods. Thus, what we translate  as “‘(He [=the poet] is) the herdsmen of the immortal’—(the son who, though) he  moves about below, sees above the other [=his father]” can also be read as “(He  [=Agni] is) the herdsmen of the immortal, who, though he moves about below, sees  above the other [=sun?].” That Agni is the object to be rightly perceived, referred to but not named in verse  3, which will confer poetic prowess, is made very clear in verse 4, though again the  name Agni does not appear—only unmistakable descriptions of fire. The imme diacy of the revelation is underlined by the repeated near-deictic pronoun “here  (is)” (a: ayám, b: idám, c: ayám). This anonymous but unambiguous description  of Agni is continued in verse 5, where he is the entire focus also of the gods. Also  important in verse 5 is the characterization of Agni as “swiftest mind,” for it is the  mental energy of Agni that the poet is absorbing.
In verse 6 the 1st-person poet returns, and with clear excitement testifies to the  new flights of his poetic perception and imagination, matching the swift-flying  mind of Agni in verse 5. The “light deposited in my heart” is clearly the light of  Agni’s inspiration. He ends the verse with questions about what he will now say and  think—no longer out of a feeling of powerlessness (as in vs. 2), but a sense of future  possibilities. (This difference is also conveyed by a change in verbal tense/mood: in  verse 2 he wonders about his speech in the subjunctive mood; here he uses the future  tense, conveying certainty.)
The hymn has a neatly structured omphalos shape. Verses 1 and 7 are the ritual  frame; verses 2 and 6 contain the contrasting 1st-person self-descriptions of the  poet; verses 3 and 5 provide the inner frame, identifying Agni as the object of per ception of both gods and men; while verse 4 is the omphalos, with its insistent,  deictic revelation of Agni immediately before the poet’s (and our) eyes.
### 1
The black day and the silvery day roll out through the two dusky realms  according to their knowing ways.
Agni Vaiśvānara, (even) while being born, like a king suppressed the  dark shades with his light.
### 2
I do not know the thread, nor know how to weave, nor (know) what the  wanderers [=fingers? threads? shuttles?] weave at their meeting.
Whose son will be able to speak what is to be said here, as someone  higher than his father, (who is) below?
### 3
Just he (knows) the thread; he knows how to weave; he will be able to  speak what is to be said in proper order—
(the one) who will rightly perceive him [=Agni]: “(He [=the poet] is) the  herdsmen of the immortal”—(the son who, though) he moves about  below, sees above the other [=his father].
### 4
Here is the foremost Hotar: look at him. Here is the light, immortal  among mortals.
Here was he born, set steadfast down here, immortal, becoming strong  through his own body.
### 5
The steadfast light, set down to be seen—the mind swiftest among (all)  those that fly—
all the gods, of one mind and one perception, come separately straight to  (him) as their single resolve.784 VI.10
### 6
My two ears fly widely, widely my sight, widely this light that was  deposited in my heart.
Widely goes my mind, my intentions at a distance. What shall I say, and  what now shall I think?
### 7
All the gods, in fear, offered homage to you, Agni, while you were (still)  standing in the darkness.
Let Vaiśvānara give help to aid us; let the immortal one give help to  aid us.

The sentiments in this hymn are familiar ones: Agni as ritual fire being kindled  at the sacrifice, blazing brightly, receiving praise, and bestowing blessings on the  poet and his patrons. It is characterized, however, by a subtle strain of deliber ately misleading expectations (in part necessarily obscured by translation). On  several occasions the audience would automatically assign a referent on the basis  of formulaics and context only to discover later in the verse that the assumed  reference is wrong. In translation this is most easily seen in verse 3, where the first  phrase appears to describe Agni, but it turns out to be instead the poet serving  Agni. The beginning of verse 2 belongs to a formula found in a number of places  in the R̥gveda that imposes an identification of Agni on the opening demonstra
tive “that.” It is only in the second half of the verse that it becomes clear that  the demonstrative instead modifies “praise.” The extreme ellipsis of verse 2 con tributes to this game of disappointed expectations: two objects in that verse lack  overt verbs to govern them.
### 1
Set in front your gladdening, heavenly Agni, (who receives) well-twisted  (hymns), while the sacrifice, the ceremony is proceeding.
(Set him) in front with solemn words, for he is far-radiant for us. As  Jātavedas (he) will perform good ceremonies.
### 2
That—o heaven-bright Hotar of Manu, o Agni of many faces, on being  kindled along with the (other) fires—
(that) praise (take to yourself) which (I chant) to him forcefully like
Mamatā [/in my me-ness]. My thoughts purify themselves like
gleaming ghee.
### 3
That one is swollen with praise among mortals who as inspired poet  performs ritual service for Agni with solemn words.
With brilliant help the one of brilliant flame sets him [=the poet] to the  winning of a stable full of cows.
### 4
He who, (even) while being born, has filled the two wide (world-halves)  with his light, visible from afar—(though) his course is black— so even across the dense darkness of the night the pure one is visible with  his flame.
### 5
Now, Agni, with your help that brings many prizes, establish brilliant  wealth for us and for our benefactors—
those who, by their generosity and fame, surpass the others, and by good  heroes en masse dominate the peoples.
### 6
Eagerly take delight in this sacrifice here, Agni, which the seated one with  his oblation offers to you.
Among the Bharadvājas you have taken to yourself the well-twisted  (hymn); aid in the winning of the prize to be secured.
### 7
Dispel hatreds; increase refreshment. – Having good heroes might we  rejoice for a hundred winters.

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verse: triṣṭubh
The insistent emphasis throughout this hymn is on Agni as Hotar priest and sacri ficer, who sacrifices both for and to himself.
### 1
Perform sacrifice yourself as superior sacrificer, o Hotar Agni, when  prompted, pressingly as if at the hitching up of the Maruts.
Here to us you should turn Mitra and Varuṇa, the Nāsatyas, Heaven and  Earth to the Hotar-work.
### 2
You are our most gladdening Hotar, without deceit, god among men  through (all) the rites.
As the conveyor (of oblations) with your mouth, o Agni, with your pure  tongue perform sacrifice yourself to your own self.
### 3
For even the wealthy Holy Place longs for (this) in regard to you, (to put  you) forward to sacrifice to the gods, to their races, for the singer,
when the most inspired of the Aṅgirases, the inspired poet rhythmically  speaks his honey, hoarse-voiced in his quest.
### 4
He has flashed, the very clever, wide-radiant one. O Agni, perform  sacrifice yourself to the two world-halves of broad extent—
(you, Agni,) whom, like Āyu, they anoint with reverence—the five
peoples having bestowed oblations (anoint) him who receives the
pleasurable offerings.
### 5
When I twist the ritual grass with reverence beside the fire, the ladle  filled with ghee, along with a well-twisted hymn, has (already) been
held forth;
the sitting place (of Agni) has been fastened to the seat of the earth. The  sacrifice has been fixed (on him), like (a man’s) eye on the sun.
786 VI.12
### 6
Be favorable to us, o Hotar of many faces, along with the gods, on being  kindled along with (the other) fires, o Agni.
O son of strength, clothing ourselves in riches as if in a girthband, may  we slip beyond difficult straits.

6 verses: triṣṭubh
As often, the attempt to capture in words the actions of natural fire calls out the  best in the poet. The hymn has a skeleton of typical ritual description, especially  at the beginning, but this seems a simple and inert structure into which to insert a  series of increasingly contorted and fanciful images of fire.
### 1
In the middle of the dwelling, as Hotar, ruler of the ritual grass, (ruler)  of the goad, Agni is to sacrifice to the two world-halves.
Here is the truthful son of strength spread from afar like the sun, with  his flame.
### 2
You in whom heaven in its entirety [=all the gods] will now perform  sacrifice, as it were—you the very clever, the means of sacrifice,
the king—
(you) with your three seats, like the plumage of (a bird) that has
traversed (the sky?), are to sacrifice the oblations, the bounties of the  sons of Manu.
### 3
(He) whose (course) is sharpest, the spoked wheel (of the sacrifice), the  ruler in the wood, like a goad on the (race)course, he has flashed as he  grows strong (on the hearths).
The immortal one appears like an undisguised reaper in person,
(moving) without obstruction among the plants.
### 4
By our fortifying (hymns), Agni like (a horse) at running is praised in the  household, as Jātavedas.
He whose food is wood, winning like a steed with its determination, like  a father he is to be woken dawn after dawn by sacrifices.
### 5
Then they marvel at his light when, carving (the trees) at will, he travels  along the earth.
He who immediately, when unloosened, streams ever faster, like a debtor  (turned) thief he has headed straight across the waste places.
### 6
Do you, o steed, *drive here to us, when you are kindled along with all  the (other) fires, o Agni.
You pursue riches; you drive across misfortunes. – Having good heroes  might we rejoice for a hundred winters.

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn stays focused on its theme of Agni as the possessor and distributor of  treasures and blessings, and of the mortals who receive these goods through service  to Agni.
### 1
From you, well-portioned one, do all good portions spread out, like  branches from a tree—
at your attentive hearing—wealth, the victory prize at the overcoming of  obstacles, rain from heaven, the streaming of waters, (everything that  is) to be reverently invoked.
### 2
You are our Apportioner, for your treasure here is for our refreshment.  Like an encompassing (household), you of wondrous luster hold sway  (over treasure),
as Mitra does over lofty truth, o Agni. You, god, are the distributer of  an abundance of valuables.
### 3
That lord of settlements smashes the obstacle with power, o Agni, (that)  inspired poet carries the prize away from the niggard,
whom you, o provident one born of truth, incite with wealth, in concert  with the Child of the Waters.
### 4
The mortal who has achieved the “whetting” of you, o son of strength,  through hymns and solemn pronouncements, through sacrifices and  the altar,
he acquires all wealth, according to his wish, o god Agni. He shows  mastery through his goods.
### 5
These (goods) bringing good fame, consisting of good heroes, establish  here for men to thrive, o Agni, son of strength,
since with your power you make an abundance of livestock as vigor  (even) for the wolf, for the famished stranger.
### 6
O Agni, son of strength, eloquent, of extensive power, grant us progeny  and posterity and prizewinning (steeds).
With all my hymns may I attain to fulfillment. – Having good heroes  might we rejoice for a hundred winters.

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: anuṣṭubh, except śakvarī 6
Though it begins with friendship, insight, and refreshment (vs. 1), this is a martial  hymn, naming Agni as the priest specific to the Ārya (vs. 2) and asking him to give
788 VI.15
heroes and victory to the Ārya in their battles with the non-Ārya and to our particu lar group of Ārya in internal conflicts (vss. 3–5). The hymn is noteworthy in using  the metaphor of riches/wealth for an abundance of good fighting men: the phrase  “riches of the stranger” in verse 3 refers, in our opinion, to the manpower of the  Ārya, and this metaphor is repeated in verse 5.
### 1
The mortal who (has placed his) friendship in Agni and has savored  insight through his insightful thoughts,
chewing (it [=insight]) now, he should be the first to choose (it as)
refreshment, for help.
### 2
For just Agni is provident; Agni is the seer, the best ritual adept.
Agni as Hotar do the clans of Manu reverently invoke at the sacrifices. 3. For, o Agni, they [=the clans of Manu], the “riches of the stranger,”  contend with each other, every man for himself, for (your) help—
(that is,) the Āyus—(while at the same time) overcoming the Dasyu (and)  seeking to vanquish with their commandments the one who follows no  commandment.
### 4
Agni gives a hero winning the waters, vanquishing with his attack, as  lord of settlements,
whose rivals tremble at the full sight of his vast power, in fear.
### 5
For Agni, the god, through his know-how delivers from scorn
(that) mortal
whose “wealth” is victorious and unobstructible, unobstructible in the  prize-contests.
### 6
O god Agni with the might of Mitra, to us you call the gods, call the  grace of the two world-halves.
Pursue well-being, good dwelling; pursue the men of heaven. May we  cross over hatreds, over narrow straits difficult to traverse.
May we cross over; with your help may we cross over.

Vītahavya Āṅgirasa or Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
19 verses: jagatī 1–2, śakvarī 3, jagatī 4–5, atiśakvarī 6, jagatī 7–9, triṣṭubh 10–14,  śakvarī 15, triṣṭubh 16, anuṣṭubh 17, brhati 18, tri ̥ ṣṭubh 19, arranged in trcas ̥
With its nineteen verses, this hymn as a unity would clearly be out of place in the  arrangement of the maṇḍala, but dissolved into a series of five independent tr̥cas, its  first fifteen verses fit well. The last four verses (16–19) are considered by Oldenberg  (1888: 194) to be a later addition, and their vocabulary shows certain signs of com
parative modernity. The content of these triads is generally unremarkable, concentrating on the  installation of the ritual fire, Agni’s sacrificial role as envoy between gods and  men, and the ritual service performed for him by mortals. To some extent the tr̥cas  seem to be exercises in variation; for example, the first verses of the first two tr̥cas  (1, 4) share some key words and phrases and can in part be interpreted by compari
son with each other.
### 1
This guest of yours here, waking at dawn, lord of all clans will I stretch  toward with my hymn.
He, ablaze right from his birth, pursues any (food) whatever
from heaven here. For a long time the embryo eats just what is
immovable.
### 2
Whom the Bhr̥gus installed like a well-installed envoy, to be reverently  invoked at the “tree” [=sacrificial post], with flames erect,
you, o infallible one, well pleased in Vītahavya, are magnified with
eulogies every day.
### 3
You—become a strengthener of our skill, one who keeps the wolf away,  an overcomer of the stranger, distant or close.
O son of strength, (hold out) riches among mortals, hold out shelter of  great extent to Vītahavya, of great extent to Bharadvāja.
### 4
Your flashing guest with his solar glory, Agni, the Hotar conducting  good ceremonies for Manu,
possessing heaven-ruling speech like an inspired poet, the
oblation-conveying spoked wheel (of the sacrifice)—to (this) god
I stretch with my well-twisted (hymns).
### 5
Who with his pure, conspicuous body shines on earth as if with the  radiance of Dawn,
who goes in triumph on his course now like the victor in the battle with  Etaśa [=the sun’s horse], who is athirst (for oblations?) here, like (a
traveler) in the (sun’s) heat, the unaging one—
### 6
To your every fire do friendly service with a kindling stick, to your every  dear guest in hymning (them).
Seek to win the immortal one with your hymns, for the god will win what  is choice among the gods; for the god will win friendship for us among  the gods.
### 7
Agni kindled with kindling wood do I hymn with a hymn—the blazing  pure one in front, steadfast at the ceremony,
inspired poet, Hotar of many favors, without deceit—the sage poet we  beseech with appeals for grace as Jātavedas.
### 8
You, Agni, have they established in every generation as immortal  messenger, as oblation-conveyor, as protector to be reverently invoked.
790 VI.15
Both gods and mortals set down with homage the wakeful one as their  far-extending clanlord.
### 9
Seeking manifestation, o Agni, following the commandments of both  (men and gods) you speed between the two airy realms altogether. Since we choose for ourselves your thought as grace, so become a  kindly provider of threefold defense for us.
### 10
Him, of lovely countenance, of lovely appearance, of lovely outlook,  might we, who do not know, serve as the one who knows better. He will perform sacrifice, knowing all the patterns; Agni will proclaim  our oblation among the immortals.
### 11
Him, o Agni, do you protect and him do you rescue, who has achieved  an insightful thought for you, the sage poet, o champion,
or (who has achieved) the “whetting” of the sacrifice, or its (proper)  outcome. Just him do you imbue with power and with wealth.
### 12
You, Agni—protect (us) from the rapacious one, and you, mighty one— (protect) us from reproach.
Let the smoke-enwrapped (oblation) come entirely to you, to the  fold (of the gods); let thousandfold desirable wealth (come)
entirely.
### 13
Agni is the Hotar, the houselord; he is the king. He knows all the  creatures, as Jātavedas.
He who is of gods and of mortals the best sacrificer, let him, the  truthful one, set the sacrifice in motion.
### 14
O Agni, pure-flamed Hotar of the ceremony, when today you pursue  (the oblations) of the clan—for you are the sacrificer—
you will offer true (hymns?) as sacrifice when you have become manifest  in your greatness. O youngest one, convey the oblations that are  yours today.
### 15
For you watch over the well-placed pleasurable offerings then. One  should set you down, to sacrifice to the two world-halves.
Help us, bounteous one, in the winning of prizes. Agni, may we cross  over all (narrow straits) difficult to traverse; may we cross over
them—with your help may we cross over.
### 16
O Agni of the lovely face, with all the gods sit first on the
woolly womb,
the ghee-rich one that forms a nest. Lead the sacrifice straight, for the  impeller (of the sacrificer), for the sacrificer.
### 17
This Agni here the ritual adepts churn, as Atharvan (did)— (Agni) who, (though) he sought a crooked (path), they led here  unerring from the dark (places).
### 18
Be born, to pursue the gods in their entirety, for well-being. Convey the gods hither, the immortals growing strong through truth.  You cause the sacrifice to touch the gods.
### 19
O Agni, houselord of the people(s), we have made you lofty with  kindling wood.
May our household (arrangements) not be “one-horse.” With your
sharp sharpness hone us thoroughly.

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
48 verses: gāyatrī, except vardhamānā 1, 6, anuṣṭubh 27, 47–48, triṣṭubh 46, arranged  in trcas ̥
This lengthy hymn must, like the last one (VI.15), be dissolved into tr̥cas in order  to fit the numerical arrangement of the maṇḍala. As Proferes (2007: 9) points out,  this is an assemblage of Bharadvāja kindling verses, similar to the collections made  by the Vaiśvāmitras (III.27) and the Atris (V.28), likewise placed at or near the end  of their Agni cycle. Again, the content stays primarily focused on the ritual aspects  of Agni. Personal and family names are found fairly commonly (see especially the  second [vss. 4–6, and cf. vs. 19] and fifth [vss. 13–15] tr̥cas). There are overt signs of  unity within some of the tr̥cas: for instance, both the second (vss. 4–6) and the third  tr̥cas (vss. 7–9) begin each verse with a form of “you”; a variant of this is found in  the fifth tr̥ca (vss. 13–15).
### 1
You, Agni, were established as Hotar of all sacrifices
by the gods for the human race.
### 2
With your gladdening tongues sacrifice for us to the great ones in the  course of the ceremony.
Convey the gods hither and sacrifice,
### 3
For you, o ritual adept, know the ways and the paths in their straight  course,
o strong-willed god Agni, very effective at the sacrifices.
### 4
You does Bharata, along with his prizewinners, reverently invoke, now  yet again, for blessing.
He has sacrificed to the sacrificial one at the sacrifices.
### 5
You—(give) these many valuables to Divodāsa the (soma) presser, to Bharadvāja the pious.
### 6
You, as immortal messenger—convey the divine race hither,
when you hear the lovely praise of the inspired poet.
### 7
You, Agni, do the very attentive mortals reverently invoke as god at the  sacrifices,
to pursue the gods.
792 VI.16
### 8
Begin the sacrifice: your manifestation and your resolve do those of  good drops,
the desirous ones, all take pleasure in.
### 9
You are the Hotar established by Manu, the conveyor (of oblations)  with your mouth, the very wise one.
Agni, sacrifice to the clans of heaven.
### 10
Agni, being hymned, travel hither to pursue (the oblations), to give the  oblations.
Sit down as Hotar on the ritual grass.
### 11
You, Aṅgiras, with kindling sticks, with ghee do we strengthen. Blaze aloft, youngest one.
### 12
You seek to win for us here a broad, praiseworthy,
lofty mass of heroes, god Agni.
### 13
You, Agni, did Atharvan churn forth from the lotus,
(did) the liturgists (churn) from the head of the whole (world?). 14. You did Dadhyañc, the seer, son of Atharvan, kindle
as obstacle-smasher, stronghold-splitter.
### 15
You did Vr̥ṣan Pāthya kindle as best Dasyu-smasher,
winning the stakes in every battle.
### 16
Come here. I will speak to you, Agni, in this way: “(There are)  other hymns,
but with these drops here you will become strong.”
### 17
Wherever your mind is (set), (there) you will set your skill next, there you will make your seat.
### 18
Since what is granted to you will not be (just) a speck, you good one,  who are on (our) side,
therefore you will win (us) friendship.
### 19
Agni has come here, the one belonging to the Bharatas,
obstacle-smasher, manifest to many,
lord of the settlements of Divodāsa.
### 20
For he will piously offer wealth beyond all earthly (goods) by his  greatness,
winning (though) himself unwon, indestructible.
### 21
O Agni, as of old but anew, with lasting brilliance
you stretch aloft with your radiance.
### 22
Comrades, boldly chant forth to Agni your praise and sacrifice and sing to the ritual adept.
### 23
For he is the one who has sat through the human (life)spans as Hotar  with a poet’s purpose,
and as the messenger conveying the oblations. 24. To the two kings of blazing commandments [=Mitra and Varuṇa], the  Ādityas, the Marutian flock,
o good one, sacrifice here, and to the two world-halves.
### 25
Good is your manifestation, Agni, for the prospering mortal—
(the manifestation) of (you) the immortal, o child of nourishment.
### 26
Acccording to your will let the giver be best off, winning you today,  acquiring a good legacy.
The mortal has achieved a (hymn) with a good twist.
### 27
Those aided by you, Agni, (are ones) prospering through their whole  lifetime,
overcoming the hostilities of the stranger, vanquishing the hostilities of  the stranger.
### 28
Agni with his sharp flame will run down every rapacious one.
Agni will win us wealth.
### 29
Wealth in good heroes bring here, o unbounded Jātavedas.
Smash the demonic forces, o you of good resolve.
### 30
You—protect us from narrow straits, o Jātavedas, from the one who  bears malice.
Guard us, o poet of the sacred formulation.
### 31
The mortal of evil ways who will deliver us to the murderous weapon,  o Agni,
from him protect us and from narrow straits.
### 32
You, god—deflect with your tongue that evil-doer,
the mortal who wishes to smash us.
### 33
To Bharadvāja hold out shelter of great extent,
o overpowering Agni, and goods worthy to be chosen.
### 34
Agni will keep smashing obstacles, seeking chattels, amid
admiration—
kindled, blazing when bepoured (with ghee)—
### 35
In the womb of his mother, as the father of his father, having flashed  forth at the imperishable (syllable?),
sitting on the birthplace of truth—
### 36
Bring here a sacred formulation bestowing offspring, o unbounded  Jātavedas,
o Agni, (a formulation) that will shine in heaven.
### 37
Toward you of delightful appearance, have we, affording (you) pleasure, released our songs, o might-made Agni.
### 38
Toward your shelter we have come, as if into shadow from the
(sun’s) heat,
o Agni of golden appearance—794 VI.17
### 39
You who, like a powerful sharpshooter, like a sharp-horned buffalo, have broken strongholds, o Agni.
### 40
Whom they carry like a bangle on the hand, like an infant just born, Agni, who conducts good ceremonies for the clans,
### 41
(That) god carry forward, to pursue the gods, (him) the best finder  of goods.
Let him sit down on his own birthplace.
### 42
“Whet” the dear guest, just born on (the old fire) Jātavedas,
the houselord in his comfortable (birth)place.
### 43
God Agni, yoke (them) then!—those horses of yours that go straight to  their goal,
that convey (the gods) in accord with your fervor.
### 44
Drive here to us. Convey (the gods) here to the pleasurable offerings, to  pursue (them).
(Convey) the gods here to drink the soma.
### 45
O Agni belonging to the Bharatas, constantly flashing brilliantly  upward with your inexhaustible (flame),
blaze, radiate widely, unaging one.
### 46
The mortal who with pursuit would seek friendship with the god, he,  offering oblations at the ceremony, should reverently invoke Agni.
With outstretched hands he should seek to win with homage the Hotar  whose sacrifice comes true in the two world-halves.
### 47
Here to you, Agni, we bring with a verse an oblation fashioned by  our heart:
let the oxen, bulls, and mated cows be yours.
### 48
Agni do the gods kindle at the front, as the best obstacle-smasher by whom goods are brought here and the demonic powers crushed—by  the prizewinner.

17 (458) Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
15 verses: triṣṭubh, except dvipadā 15
This hymn is divided into two roughly equal parts, with the first devoted to the  Vala myth (vss. 2–6), the second to the Vr̥tra myth (vss. 8–12). The first verse  announces these two themes in order, allotting each a half-verse. The two mythic  segments are separated by a verse about Indra’s general cosmogonic deeds (7); the  last three verses (13–15) urge Indra to use the same powers to help the poet and  his patrons. The account of both narratives emphasizes the role of soma in rousing Indra  to his great deeds, and the hymn begins with three verses (1–3) with the insistent  imperative “drink!” The Vala myth is in fact configured as a model for Indra’s  behavior in the present with the mythic deeds presented as still to happen: he is  enjoined to drill through to the cattle pen (vss. 2, 3) and to disclose the sun (vs. 3).  The hymn thus appears to be associated with the activities at dawn. The Vr̥tra myth  is more consistently presented as a deed in the past (though see vss. 8, 11).
### 1
Drink the soma! The cattle enclosure that you will drill through to,  mighty Indra, when you are greatly sung—
you bold mace-bearer, who will hew apart Vr̥tra and all hostile things  with your powers—
### 2
Drink it! You who are the victorious possessor of the silvery drink, who  are the belipped, who are the bull of poetic thoughts,
who are the cowpen-splitter, the mace-bearer, who are the mounter of  fallow bays, you, Indra—drill through to the shimmering prizes.
### 3
Drink it in just this way, as of old. Let it exhilarate you. Hear our sacred  formulation, and grow strong through our songs.
Disclose the sun, swell refreshments, and smash rivals. Indra, drill
through to the cows.
### 4
The exhilarating drinks here, when drunk, make you grow loftily  brilliant, o autonomous Indra;
the invigorating drinks continually excite (you who are) great, without  deficiency, powerful, distinguished, conquering—
### 5
Becoming exhilarated on which, you made the sun and dawn to shine, as  you shattered the strongholds.
You shoved the great, immoveable rock that was enclosing the cattle  from its own seat, Indra.
### 6
Through your will and your wondrous skills you secured the cooked  (milk) in the raw (cows) by your ability.
You opened the doors, opened up the strongholds for the dawn-red ones.  Accompanied by the Aṅgirases, you sent the cows surging up from the  enclosure.
### 7
You filled the earth broad and wide—great is your wondrous skill.  Towering, you propped up heaven aloft, Indra.
You fixed fast the two world-halves, whose sons are the gods, the two  ancient but youthfully exuberant mothers of truth.
### 8
Then all the gods set you in front alone, o Indra, as the powerful one to  “carry (the day).”
When the non-god has vaunted himself to the gods, they choose Indra  here at the winning of the sun.
796 VI.18
### 9
Then even Heaven, she [=Earth] likewise also, bent away from your  mace, through fear of your own battle fury,
when Indra struck down the vaunting serpent to lie there for a full
lifespan.
### 10
Then Tvaṣṭar turned the mace with its thousand spikes and hundred  edges for you who are great, o powerful one,
that eager, devoted (mace) with which you utterly crushed the
screaming serpent, you possessor of the silvery drink.
### 11
(You) whom all the Maruts in concert will strengthen, for you, Indra,  he [=Agni] cooks a hundred buffaloes.
Pūṣan, Viṣṇu (and the others) rinse the exhilarating Vr̥tra-smashing
plant, three lakes (full), for him.
### 12
You sent surging here the great gush of rivers that had been blocked  and surrounded, the wave of waters.
Along their slopes, along their path, Indra, you set the busy (waters)  tossing, downward to the sea.
### 13
Indra having done all these things in just this way, the great, mighty,  ageless giver of strength,
possessing good heroes, good weapons, and a good mace—you—might  our new sacred formulation turn here for help.
### 14
Provide our inspired poets with brilliance—for (them to acquire) the  prize: fame and refreshment, and wealth, o Indra;
at Bharadvāja’s (provide) our patrons with superior men, o Indra. And,  as ever, be there for us, Indra, on the decisive day.
### 15
With this (hymn) might we win the prize established by the gods.  – Having good heroes might we rejoice for a hundred winters.

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
15 verses: triṣṭubh
The poet of this hymn seems to be aiming to deploy as many different words for  power, might, strength, and so forth in as many different derivational forms as pos sible. The sheer power of Indra, thus expressed, overshadows his particular deeds,  which are mentioned in a somewhat cursory way: Vala (vs. 5), Vr̥tra (vs. 6, also 9  and 14), the destruction of various named monsters (vs. 8). The poet is also fond  of figures involving a positive and a twist on its negation: “vanquishing but unvan quished” (vs. 1), and so forth.
This focus on Indra’s power betrays some nervous worry about the existence  of that power, expressed especially in the rhetorical question and answer in verses  3–4. A number of hymns in the R̥gveda raise the question of whether Indra himself exists; here the existential anxiety has been displaced to an abstract entity, his might,  but the poet asserts its existence so often and so unequivocally that his audience can  scarcely doubt it. Needless to say, the recital of Indra’s strength is not disinter ested: the poet calls for Indra to use his powers in defense of the poet’s people and,  in the last verse (15), to perform the deed that exists for him to do (a nice return to  the existential theme), in order to merit another poem from the poet.
### 1
Praise him whose might is overpowering, the vanquishing but
unvanquished, much-summoned Indra.
Mighty, conquering but unconquered, the bull of the settled domains— strengthen him with these songs.
### 2
He—the fighting warrior, creator of tumult, combat-hardened, the  powerfully destructive, bellowing partaker of the silvery drink,
with high-mounting dust—alone became the victorious rouser of the  communities of the sons of Manu.
### 3
It was just you who tamed the Dasyus, and who alone vanquished (their)  communities for the Ārya.
Does that heroic power now exist for you, Indra, or does it not? You will  announce that at the proper season.
### 4
It certainly does exist for you!—so I think: strength, o strongest one, (has  come) to you, who were powerfully born, the surpassing surpasser— mighty (strength) has come to the mighty one, more powerful (strength)  to the powerful one who, himself not feeble, furthers the feeble.
### 5
“Let our age-old partnership with you (all) (still) exist,” with the  Aṅgirases speaking in just this way—along with them
you smashed the prospering Vala cave, o wondrous shaker of the
unshakable, and you opened its strongholds and its doors, all of them. 6. He is to be summoned with insightful thoughts—the mighty one who  performs the master’s part in the great overcoming of Vr̥tra,
in the winning of progeny, in (the winning of) posterity. As the
mace-bearer he became worth tussling for in battles.
### 7
Through his greatness and his immortal name he has extended himself  over the races of the sons of Manu.
He is at home with brilliance and with power and wealth, and he, the  best of men, with heroism—
### 8
He, the man who is not to be confused and is not wrong, bearing a name  that is good to think upon. Cumuri and Dhuni
did Indra wring out, and Pipru, Śambara, and Śuṣṇa—to shake their  strongholds and for (them) to lie there even now.
### 9
With your helpful energy, (ever) more to be admired, up and mount your  chariot, Indra, for the Vr̥tra-smashing.
Place your mace in your hand on the right side. Stimulate your magical  powers, o you who give much.
798 VI.19
### 10
As fire does dry wood, like a terrifying missile burn down the demon  with your lance, o Indra.
He who shattered the obstacles to progress with a (lance) both deep and  high, he smoked them out and subjugated them.
### 11
Along a thousand paths affording powerful prizes, o powerfully  brilliant Indra, drive here in our direction with wealth,
o much summoned son of strength, whom a godless man never has the  power to repel.
### 12
The greatness of the powerfully brilliant, stalwart, ardent one has  overflowed from heaven and earth.
There exists no rival for him, nor counterpart, no opponent for the
strong one with many magical powers.
### 13
This deed done by you stands out today—that for his sake
[=Tūrvayāṇa’s?] (you ground down) Kutsa, Āyu, and Atithigva;
many thousands did you grind down to earth. You led Tūrvayāṇa up  boldly.
### 14
Then, o god, all the gods cheer you on for the serpent-smashing, (you)  the best poet of poets,
when you will create wide space for oppressed heaven, for its people  and for yourself as you are being sung.
### 15
Heaven and Earth and the immortal gods give way to your
might, Indra.
Do, o doer, what undone (deed) exists for you (to do). Generate a newer  hymn for yourself along with sacrifices.

19 (460) Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
13 verses: triṣṭubh
Like the previous hymn, this one exults in the mighty powers of Indra and in the  rich lexicon that describes them, although it is perhaps somewhat less insistent (but  see vs. 6ab). Also as in VI.18 the poet exhorts Indra to put his powers to good use  for the men associated with the poet. The three middle verses (6–8) all contain the  phrase “bring here to us,” each with a different abstract power as object, and the  remaining verses continue these requests for aid and support, especially in defeating  enemies and rivals.
### 1
Great is Indra—manful, filling the domains and doubly lofty,
undiminishing in his powers.
Inclined toward us, he has been strengthened for his heroic deed. Wide  and broad, he was well made by his makers. 2. The Holy Place positioned just Indra for winning, him lofty and  towering, unaging and youthful,
swollen with invincible strength, who in just a single day grew strong  and not by halves.
### 3
Broad are your forearms, ample your fists. Mete out full measures of  fame in our direction.
Like a herdsman to his flocks of livestock, as household master, o
Indra, turn here to us in the contest.
### 4
Striving for the prizes of victory here and now, we would summon him  for you, the elusive Indra along with his able (men);
(might we be) irreproachable, blameless, and invulnerable, just as the  ancient singers were.
### 5
Of steadfast commandment, giving spoils, strengthened by soma (is he),  for he is the possessor of much livestock, of goods worth winning.
The paths of wealth have joined in him, like the rivers uniting in the sea. 6. Bring here to us, o overpowering champion, the strongest strength, the  mightiest mighty might.
All things brilliant and bullish that belong to the sons of Manu—give  them to us, o master of the fallow bays, to exhilarate us.
### 7
Your exhilaration, conquering in battle, never shirking—bring us that,  swollen with strength, o Indra,
through which we could be considered victors in the winning of
progeny and posterity, aided by you.
### 8
Bring here to us, Indra, the bullish unbridled force that gains the stakes,  swollen with strength, of good skill,
through which we will vanquish our rivals in battles, both kin and
non-kin, with your help.
### 9
Let your unbridled force, a bull, come here from behind, here from  above and below, here from in front.
Let it come altogether toward us from all sides. Indra, grant to us
sun-like brilliance.
### 10
Manfully, with your most manly help, Indra, we would win what is  worth winning through your attentions.
Because you are master of both kinds of good, o king, grant a great,  substantial, lofty treasure.
### 11
Him, accompanied by the Maruts, the bull grown strong, not stingy, the  heavenly commander—Indra—
the all-conquering, mighty giver of strength—him we would invoke  here for present help.
### 12
The person who thinks himself to be ever so great, o mace-bearer— make him subject to these superior men, among whom am I—
for therefore do we summon you at the contest of champions when the  earth, lineage, cows, and waters (are at stake).
800 VI.20
### 13
By these partnerships with you, o much invoked one, might we be  higher than each and every rival.
Smashing both kinds of obstacles, o champion, we would be exultant  through lofty wealth, when helped by you.

20 (461) Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
13 verses: triṣṭubh, except virāj 7
Unlike the usual model, this hymn begins with the prayer for gifts from the god (vs.  1). But most of the rest of the hymn is devoted to a verse-by-verse listing of Indra’s  great deeds, not only the standard Vr̥tra (vs. 2) and Vala (vss. 3–4) tales, but also  the defeat of a series of named enemies on behalf of named mortal clients. Some  of these stories are familiar (the Śuṣṇa/Kutsa story, vss. 4–5, and the stealing of  Namuci’s head, vs. 6), and some are mentioned much more rarely (e.g., Vetasu and  Tuji, vs. 8), with unclear details. Many of these same stories are also treated in VI.26.
### 1
O Indra, wealth that in its vast power surmounts (the wealth) of the  stranger, (namely) the peoples in battles, as heaven does the earth,
that brings thousands as plunder, wins fertile fields, and overcomes
obstacles—give that (wealth) to us, o son of strength.
### 2
All lordly power, like (that) of heaven, was entirely ceded to you by the  gods, o Indra,
when you, accompanied by Viṣṇu, smashed the serpent Vr̥tra, who had  obstructed the waters, you possessor of the silvery drink.
### 3
Overpowering, mightier and stronger than the strong, he for whom the  sacred formulation is created, whose greatness increased—Indra
became king of the somian honey when he aided the splitting of all the  strongholds.
### 4
The Paṇis were felled here by hundreds (of deadly weapons), o Indra, for  the sake of the ten-armed poet at the winning of the (sun’s) rays;
by the deadly weapons the magic powers of the voracious Śuṣṇa (were  felled). Nothing at all had he left over from the meal.
### 5
A whole lifetime of great deception was set aside when Śuṣṇa was felled  at the flying of the mace.
Sharing the same chariot, Indra made a wide way for Kutsa, the sharer  of his chariot, at the winning of the sun.
### 6
Like the falcon stealing the exhilarating plant for him, he, stealing the  head of the Dāsa Namuci,
helped Namī Sāpya as he slept. He imbued (him) with wealth, with
refreshment, and with well-being. 7. You split open the fortified strongholds of Pipru, who had the tricks of  a snake, o mace-bearer, as if with swelling strength.
O generous giver, you gave that legacy not to be spurned as a gift to the  pious R̥jiśvan.
### 8
Indra showed the favor of his dominance to Vetasu of the ten tricks  and ten arms and to the thrusting (Tuji), (saying,)
“Tugra as perpetual vassal for brilliant (Vetasu) shall I dispatch, like  (calves) to their mother, to go (to him).”
### 9
Unopposable, he will vanquish the contenders, bearing his
Vr̥tra-smashing mace in his fist.
He mounts his two fallow bays, like an archer upon his chariot seat;  those yoked by speech convey lofty Indra.
### 10
Might we win anew through your help, Indra. The Pūrus start up the  praise with this (hymn) along with sacrifices.
When he split the seven autumnal strongholds, their shelter, he smote  the Dāsa (clans), doing his best for Purukutsa.
### 11
You, Indra, became the first strengthener. Making wide space for  Uśanā Kāvya,
(to him as?) grandfather you handed over Navavāstu, who was to be  delivered up, as his own grandson.
### 12
You, the tumultuous one, Indra, set the tumultuous waters in motion,  flowing like streams.
When you will cross the sea, o hero, make Turvaśa and Yadu cross to  well-being.
### 13
Everything in the contest is yours, Indra. Dhuni and Cumuri sleep,  whom you put to sleep.
Just he will shine: Dabhīti who presses for you with the soma juices,  who brings the firewood and the cooked food, along with the chants.
## 21 
21 (462) Indra (1–8, 10, 12), All Gods (9, 11)
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
12 verses: triṣṭubh
The first pāda of this hymn introduces one of its major concerns: the relationship  between the current poet and the generations of previous poets to whose lineage  he belongs and the question of whether Indra will pay the same attention to the  current poet as he did to the older ones (see also vss. 4–6, 8, 10). This theme is  connected to the common worry about whether Indra himself exists and, if so,  where—subtly articulated in verses 2 and 4, and triumphantly refuted in the last  pāda of verse 10. The themes are connected by the anxiety about Indra’s epiphany  (see esp. vs. 4). Since the goal of the soma sacrifice is to produce Indra’s epiphany,  that is, his appearance at our ritual ground, then his absence may result either from
802 VI.21
his favoring another group of sacrificers and poets or from the fact that he doesn’t  exist at all!
### 1
These insights of this latest of many bards, (insights) deserving to  invoke, newly invoke
you who deserve invoking, o hero, the unaging chariot-mounter.
Extensive wealth is sped by their eloquence.
### 2
I will praise him who is known as “Indra,” whose vehicle is songs, who  is strengthened by sacrifice along with songs,
him of many wiles, whose greatness projects beyond heaven and earth  in their greatness.
### 3
Just he made the patternless darkness in its extension to be patterned by  the sun.
When do mortals, seeking gain, not violate the ordinances that belong  to you, the immortal, o autonomous one?
### 4
He who did these things, where then is he—this “Indra”? Upon what  people does he attend? Among which clans?
What sacrifice is weal for your thought, your wish? What chant, Indra?  Which one is your Hotar?
### 5
For up to now they have been ever toiling for you, o doer of many  (deeds)—those who were born long ago, your ancient comrades,
those in between, and the current ones. Much-invoked one, take
cognizance of the one who is closest.
### 6
The closer ones, asking about him, have guided themselves following  your distant, ancient (acts) worthy of fame, Indra.
As far as we know it, that far we chant to you as the great one, you hero  with the sacred formulation as your vehicle.
### 7
The face of the demon has spread out against you, who were born  great. Stand up to it well!
With your ancient, conjoined comrade, your mace, o bold one, thrust  these away.
### 8
Listen, Indra, to the current (bard) creating sacred formulations, you  hero who give succor to bards—
for you, as the friend of our ancestors in olden days, have always been  easy to invoke in the quest.
### 9
Bring forward for help Varuṇa, Mitra, Indra, and the Maruts, to help  us today,
forward Pūṣan, Viṣṇu, Agni and Plenty, Savitar, the plants, and the
mountains.
### 10
These singers here with their chants chant to you, o you of many  talents, receiving the first of the sacrifice.
Listen to the call of him who calls you here as you are called. Immortal  one, there exists no one like you, other than you. 11. Now drive here, right up to my speech, since you know, o son of  strength, together with all those worthy of the sacrifice,
who had Agni as their tongue and served the truth, who put Manu very  close to Dasa.
### 12
Become a leader for us on easy roads and on difficult ones, since you  are known as a path-maker.
The broad, unflagging (horses), the best conveyors—with them convey  the prize to us, o Indra.
## 22 
22 (463) Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
11 verses: triṣṭubh
Like the previous hymn, this one compares the current poet to previous genera tions of poets (see vss. 2, 4, 7) and asks Indra directly what in the sacrifice might  please him (vs. 4 [cf. VI.21.4]). In fact, the same phrase is used in both hymns to  introduce other questions: VI.21.6 tám pr̥chántaḥ “(the singers) asking about him”  and VI.22.5 tám pr̥chántī “(the song) asking about him.” In each case the subject  (singers or song) seeks information about ways to make contact and find favor with  Indra, though the anxiety seems less in this hymn than in VI.21.
The similarities between VI.21 and 22 extend to their final verses. The exhor tation to come here with his teams in VI.22.11 is structurally and semantically,  though not lexically, parallel to two halves of the two final verses of VI.21, 11ab  and 12cd—an interesting example of how a poet can expand an underlying formu laic sequence by inserting new material.
Otherwise, the hymn alternates verses praising Indra’s qualities and deeds in  list-like fashion (e.g., vss. 1cd, 2cd) and begging him for wealth and martial help  (e.g., vss. 3, 8, 10). Stylistically it is noteworthy that in much of the hymn, particu larly at the beginning, the initial word of every half-verse refers to Indra (1a, c; 2a,  c; 3a; 5a, c; 7a, c; 11a). In 3c, the first half-verse in the hymn not beginning with a  word referring to Indra, the poet tricks us by playing on our expectations: the yáḥ “who” could easily be Indra, as it was earlier (see 1a, c), but in fact has a different  referent. The most complex verse syntactically is verse 5, which is perhaps fitting, as  it describes the poet’s own song.
### 1
To him who alone is to be called by the separate peoples, to Indra chant  with these hymns,
to the bull with bull-like strength who is master, the real “real thing”  with many magic wiles, mighty.
### 2
To him (chanted) our earlier ancestors, the Navagvas, the seven inspired  poets, inciting (him),804 VI.22
to him who catches up to the cheat, the surpassing one who stays on the  mountains, whose speech is without deception, to the strongest one,  with their thoughts.
### 3
This Indra do we beseech for his wealth, consisting of many heroes, of  superior men, of much livestock,
which is not stunted, not aging, and is filled with sunlight. O master of  the fallow bays, bring that here to elate (us).
### 4
Will you declare this to us—whether ever before singers have obtained  your favor, Indra?
What is your portion? What is the vital energy that belongs to a  smasher of (rival) lords, you headstrong hammer-head, invoked by  many, bringing many goods?
### 5
The quivering, surging (song), asking about him whose hand holds the  mace, who stands upon the chariot—about Indra, whose song it is— (him who is) powerfully grasping, powerfully ranging, taking on wild  frenzy—(the song) seeks her way; she catches up to the bulging one  [=Indra].
### 6
With this magic power (of yours), with the mountain [=mace] that has  the speed of thought (you shattered) him who had grown strong  through his magic power, you self-powerful one.
You boldly shattered even the immovable, firm fastnesses, o you of  good might who confer abundance.
### 7
(It is) for you [=poets] to tug at him, the strongest one, from every  direction with a newer insight, him the ancient one as the
ancients did.
Indra, who is without measure, the good conveyor, will convey us  across all difficult depths.
### 8
You set ablaze the earthly and heavenly (realms) and the midspaces  against the deceitful people.
Scorch them on every side with your flame, o bull. Enflame the earth  and waters against the hater of the sacred formulation.
### 9
You become the king of the heavenly folk and of the earthly, moving  world, o you of glittering face.
Set your mace in your right hand, Indra. Unaging one, you fragment all  magic wiles.
### 10
(Set) here uninterrupted well-being for us, lofty and not negligible, for  us to overcome our rivals, Indra,
(well-being) by which you will make the Dāsa and Ārya obstacles easy  to thrust away, o mace-bearer, and those from the Nahuṣas.
### 11
Come here to us with the teams that bring all desirable things, you ritual  adept summoned by many, you who receive the first of the sacrifice. (The teams) that neither a non-god nor a god will hinder, with them  drive here swiftly in my direction. 

## 23
23 (464) Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
10 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn focuses on Indra’s vital connection with soma and on the reciprocal  relationship between the soma-presser and Indra, the soma-drinker. This theme is  established in the first pāda of the first verse, and every subsequent verse has some  reference to soma: all but verse 8 contain a form of the word sóma (and vs. 8 does  make clear reference to soma-induced exhilaration), and of those, all but verse 7  have “pressed,” “pressing,” or “presser” as well. The other ritual aspects of the soma  sacrifice, especially the poetry and sacred formulations, also receive frequent men
tion. The reminders to Indra that sacrificial labor should be requited with gifts and  help from the god occur throughout the hymn, but are not annoyingly obtrusive. Stylistically the hymn is noteworthy for its pairs of syntactically linked verses: 1–2  with their “or when” clauses; 3–4 with their run of agent nouns governing accusa tive objects; 5–6 with a number of repeated formulae.
### 1
You are intertwined in the pressed soma, Indra, and in the praise song, in  the sacred formulation, and in solemn speech as it is recited,
when, bounteous one, you drive with your two yoked fallow bays,
bearing your mace in your arms,
### 2
Or when on the decisive day, Indra, you help the soma-presser in the  smiting of obstacles [/Vr̥tra] and at the contest of champions,
or when, (yourself) being unafraid, as their skill became fearful, you  subdued the vaunting Dasyus, Indra.
### 3
Let Indra be the drinker of the pressed soma, the mighty one ever  leading the singer forward with his help,
the maker of wide space for the hero and the soma-presser, the giver of  goods to his praiser, even a feeble one,
### 4
Going to even such pressings as these with his two fallow bays, bearing  his mace, drinking soma, giving cows,
who makes the manly hero possessed of hale heroes, the hearer of the  singer’s call, for praise songs are his vehicle.
### 5
It is for him that we toil at what he holds dear—for Indra, who has  performed labor for us from of old.
When the soma is pressed, we sing praise; (a priest) recites the
solemn words, so that the sacred formulation will be strengthening  for Indra.
### 6
For you have made the sacred formulations strengthening for yourself, to  the extent that we have toiled for you, Indra, with our thoughts.
When the soma is pressed, o soma-drinker, might we make (the
pressings/the formulations) to be most wealful, enjoyable means of
increase (for you) through our sacrifices.
806 VI.24
### 7
As giver, take notice of our offering cake; drink the soma, foamy with  cows [=milk], Indra.
Sit right here on the ritual grass of the sacrificer. Make wide, wide
space for him in devoted pursuit of you.
### 8
Find elation according to your liking, mighty one. Let these sacrifices  reach you.
Let these calls among us (reach) the one called by many. Might this
insightful thought guide you here for help, Indra.
### 9
So that he (will be) together with you at the pressings, comrades, fill him  with soma juices, Indra the benefactor.
Surely he will be there for us for the taking? Indra will not neglect the  soma-presser, not neglect to help him.
### 10
Just in this way, when the soma is pressed, Indra has been praised  among the Bharadvājas. Just he has power over the liberal man,
so that he [=liberal man] will be a patron to the singer. Indra is a giver  of wealth that brings all desirable things.

24 (465) Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
10 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn begins, like the last one, with a strong statement of Indra’s relationship with  soma, but it then turns to more general praises of the god (vss. 2–8), with some strik ing similes, metaphors, and etymological figures. The importance of mortal praise and  worship for maintaining Indra’s powers is not forgotten; see verses 7–8 and especially  verse 6, which seems to concern the traffic in praise: inspiration going out from Indra  to the poets and then returning to him as praise (for a similar sentiment and phraseol ogy, see VI.34.1). The last two verses (9–10) ask for Indra’s gifts and protection.
### 1
Bullish exuberance, noise, and solemn words are in Indra; he is the  drinker of the pressings and in possession of the silvery drink, when  the soma juices are in his company.
He is worthy to be chanted by men with solemn words as the bounteous  one, the heaven-ruling king of hymns, whose help is imperishable.
### 2
The surpassing hero, favorable to men, discriminating, the hearer of the  singer’s call, whose help is wide-ranging,
the good one, the Laud of Men, who gives succor to bards, praised as  the prizewinner, he gives the prize at the rite of distribution.
### 3
Like an axle beyond its two wheels, your lofty (greatness), o champion,  projects beyond the two worlds in their greatness. (Like) the branches of a tree, your forms of help have grown outward,  o much-invoked Indra.
### 4
The abilities that belong to you, the able one, o you of many abilities,  are converging like streams of cattle.
(They are) like cords for calves, Indra, binding without bonds, o you of  good bonds [/gifts].
### 5
One deed today and another tomorrow, one which is not and another  which is—Indra makes (them) happen in an instant.
Mitra and Varuṇa, also Pūṣan, are there for us, but it is he [=Indra] who  keeps the will of the stranger contained.
### 6
Like waters forth from the back of a mountain, they proceeded forth  from you along with solemn words and sacrifices, Indra.
Along with these good praises, seeking the prize they have (also) gone  to you, like horses to a contest, o you whose vehicle is songs.
### 7
Indra, whom the autumns do not age, nor do the months, nor days  make lean—
may his body, even though he is fully grown, grow stronger while it is  being celebrated by praises and solemn words.
### 8
He does not bow to the tough, nor to the stubborn, nor to the vaunting  one sped by the Dasyus, when he receives praise.
Even the towering mountains are flatlands for Indra. Even in the deep  there is a ford for him.
### 9
With a (vessel) that is deep and wide, o bearer of the vessel, hold forth  to us refreshments and prizes, you drinker of the pressings,
and stand erect with your help, allowing no harm, at the early
brightening of the night, at its final turn.
### 10
Accompany our leader to help him at the close encounter, or protect  him from harm from here, Indra.
Protect him from harm at home and in the wilderness. – Having good  heroes might we rejoice for a hundred winters.

25 (466) Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
9 verses: triṣṭubh
The clear purpose of this hymn is to solicit Indra’s aid against enemies in battle. The  various types of opponents are vividly described, as well as the potential types of  hostile encounter: see especially the apparent wrestling match in 4ab. But the poet’s  expressed confidence in Indra’s ability to provide the decisive assistance is also a  subtle way of asserting the supremacy of Indra. This second theme can be seen
808 VI.25
more clearly by examining the structure of the hymn: verse 5, which concerns the  invincibility of Indra, is the exact middle of the hymn and serves as an omphalos;  verses 4 and 6 match each other in structure and referents and form a ring around  the omphalos, with a further ring provided by repeated phrases in verses 1/2 and  8/9, with Indra’s supremacy repeated in verse 8.
### 1
What is your nearest help, what your farthest, and what your midmost,  tempestuous Indra,
with those (forms of help) help us well at the Vr̥tra-smashing and with  these prizes, as the great one among us, o mighty one.
### 2
With these (forms of help), o Indra, (you who) allow no harm—cause  the contenders who oppose (us) to falter, cause the battle fury of the  foe to falter;
with them bring down all the attackers (to be) scattered asunder, bring  down the Dāsa clans for the Ārya.
### 3
O Indra, the rapacious ones who, kin or not kin, have hitched themselves  up, turning here against us,
(render) their powers faltering, smash their bull-like (strengths), put  them far away.
### 4
Now a champion may defeat (another) champion with his limbs when  the two, their bodies gleaming, will set upon each other in their
struggle to overcome,
or when, with offspring, cattle, lineage, waters, and fields at stake, their  two war-cries will dispute with each other.
### 5
Yet no champion, no overpowering and no bold one, no one thinking  himself a fighter has fought against you.
Indra, none of these is equal to you. You dominate all that have
been born.
### 6
He is master of the manly power of both of these (armies) when the  ritual adepts call on him in the clash,
when, whether an obstacle or a dwelling place rich in men is at issue, the  two (armies) in their expansion keep tussling mightily back and forth  with one another.
### 7
So then, when your separate peoples will stir, Indra, become the rescuer  and defender (of those,)
our most manly patrons, who have set us ahead of the stranger, o Indra. 8. It was conceded to you, to your great Indrian power; everything was  entirely conceded to you at the Vr̥tra-smashing;
dominion was conceded, victorious might conceded, o Indra worthy of  sacrifice, conceded to you by the gods at the victory over men.
### 9
In just this way for us herd together the contenders in the battles. Indra,  subdue the godless ones who oppose (us).
And with your help, Indra, might we Bharadvājas know (this), as we sing  just now at dawn.

8 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins (vss. 1–2) with an appeal to Indra for help in battles and contests,  much as in the immediately preceding hymn. The first two verses also play with  the word vā́ja “prize,” perhaps punning on the name of the poet and his bardic  clan, Bharad-vāja. The middle part of the hymn (vss. 3–6) gives brief accounts of  Indra’s battles against various named enemies and his aid to various named mortal  allies; in this structure it is very reminiscent of VI.20, and many of the same inci
dents, with the same, often obscure names, are found in both hymns. The final two  verses (7–8) beg Indra to show the same powers in aid of the poet and his patrons.  The structure of the hymn is thus both fairly conventional and also symmetrical,  with requests to the god in the first two and last two verses and the middle four  verses providing previous models for the aid the god is asked to supply.
Stylistically noteworthy is the regular fronting of the personal pronoun. Beginning  with verse 2, every half-verse through 5a has a fronted form of the 2nd-person sin gular pronoun “you” (and usually another one in an even pāda: 2d, 3b, 4d), either  nominative tuvám or accusative tvā́m. The rest of verse 5 briefly breaks the pat tern, which returns in verse 6. Then, interestingly, the 1st person asserts itself: 7a  ahám “I”, 8a vayám “we,” with 2nd-person genitive táva (7b) and instrumental  tváyā (7c) interspersed. This distribution corresponds to the thematic structure of  the hymn, with the recounting to Indra of his own deeds followed by requests of  him by us mortals on our own behalf. Verse 7 brings the 1st person “I” and 2nd  person “you” into happy conjunction.
### 1
Hear us, Indra. We are calling to you as we are “boiling over” at the  winning of the great prize.
When the clans clash together at the contest of champions, give us
mighty help on the decisive day.
### 2
To you does the prizewinner, son of a prizewinner, call, at the winning of  the great prize to be secured,
to you, Indra, the surpassing master of settlements, when there are
obstacles; to you does the fist-fighter look as he fights for cattle.
### 3
You spurred the poet [=Uśanā Kāvya] on at the winning of the (sun’s)  rays. You wrung out Śuṣṇa for the pious Kutsa.
You struck far away the head of the invulnerable one, intending to do (a  deed) worthy to be proclaimed for Atithigva.
### 4
You brought forward the towering battle-chariot, and helped the bull  Daśadyu as he did battle.
You struck down Tugra for Vetasu, in partnership. You, Indra,
strengthened Tuji, the singer.
810 VI.27
### 5
You made that hymn (endowed) with might, Indra, so that you could  tear out hundreds and thousands (of goods), o champion.
You struck the barbarian Śambara down from the mountain and
furthered Divodāsa with glittering help.
### 6
You, reaching elation through the hospitality offerings and the soma  juices, put Cumuri to sleep for Dabhīti.
You, showing favor to Piṭhīnas, in partnership, smashed Raji and his  sixty thousand with your power.
### 7
Might I also, together with my patrons, attain this, the greater favor and  might that are yours, Indra,
when along with you our heroes are praised, you who have our heroes  as companions, along with Nahus who provides threefold defense, o  strongest one.
### 8
Might we be your dearest comrades, Indra, at this invocation to heavenly  brilliance, o great one.
Let the son of Pratardana, glorious in dominion, be the most glorious at  the smashing of obstacles and the winning of rich stakes.

27 (468) Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
8 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn traces a satisfying arc from beginning to end: the trajectory is not pre dictable, but the progress from a large and open question to extreme specificity is  neatly handled. It begins with a question, a question all the more open because one  of the crucial terms is unspecified (though easily supplied), the repeated pronoun  asya “of it”—referring, clearly, to soma. The question is what did Indra make or  create under the influence “of it,” and the surprisingly broad answer given in the  responsive verse 2 is “what exists.”
The unqualified comprehensiveness of Indra’ production—“being,” “what  exists”—is contrasted with our imperfect knowledge of his powers in verse 3. But  even what small proportion of that power we have experienced (vs. 4) was more  than sufficient to destroy the Vr̥cīvant army of the enemy Varaśikha for the benefit  of the poet’s patron, Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna—a battle described in verses 4–7. The  second half of verse 6 is especially notable for its warrior slang: the phrase “playing  the lord’s role for an arrow,” which also appears in X.27.6, in our opinion refers to  warriors’ boasting, and “breaking their pots,” which many commentators have tried  to interpret literally, must show the same use of “pot” for “head” as, for example,  German “Kopf” and French “tête.” In our opinion the site of the battle is the con fluence of two rivers, mentioned by name in verses 5 and 6, and then referred to  jointly in verse 7. The dual bovines in that verse have been variously interpreted, but in our opinion, despite a problem with grammatical gender, the most likely referents  are the rivers, in a phrase very reminiscent of one (III.33.1) describing two rivers as  mother cows licking each other in the famous hymn III.33, the dialogue between  the poet Viśvāmitra and two rivers.
The final verse is a dānastuti, praising and detailing the gift made by Abhyāvartin  Cāyamāna to the poet. The poet gives his patron the epithets “bounteous,” a stan dard qualification of Indra (as in vs. 3 in this very hymn), and “universal king,” also  regularly used of Indra (among other divinities). He thus verbally associates his  patron with the unlimited power of Indra, as it was portrayed earlier in the hymn.
### 1
What did Indra create in the exhilaration of it, what at the drinking of it?  what in the fellowship of it?
Or those [=priests] who were there with joy at the installation of it— what did those previous ones acquire? what do the current ones?
### 2
Indra created what exists in the exhilaration of it, what exists at the  drinking of it; what exists in the fellowship of it.
Or those [=priests] who were there with joy at the installation of it—the  previous ones acquired what exists; the current ones what exists.
### 3
But yet we do not know your whole greatness, nor bounteousness, o  bounteous one,
nor every current benefit (of yours). O Indra, your (whole) Indrian
strength has not shown itself.
### 4
(But) there has appeared just that Indrian strength of yours with which  you smashed the posterity of Varaśikha,
when from the blast of your mace when it was smashed down, from just  its sound, their farthest (division) shattered, Indra.
### 5
Indra smashed the posterity of Varaśikha, doing his best for Abhyāvartin  Cāyamāna,
when at the Hariyūpīyā (River) he smashed the Vr̥cīvants in the front  division, and the rear (division) shattered from fear.
### 6
O much-invoked Indra, at the Yavyāvatī (River), though they were a  hundred thirty altogether and armor-clad, with a yen for fame,
the Vr̥cīvants, playing the lord’s role for an arrow, breaking their own  “pots,” came to failed ends.
### 7
He for whom the two ruddy cows [=rivers?], seeking good pasturage,  acted the go-between as they licked each other again and again,
he handed Turvaśa and the Vr̥cīvants over to Sr̥ñjaya, doing his best for  the son of Devavāta.
### 8
O Agni, chariot-steeds by twos and twenty head of cattle together with  brides does the bounteous, universal king give to me—
Abhyāvartin the son of Cayamāna. Difficult to attain is this priestly gift  of the Pārthavas.

28 (469) The Cows and Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
8 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 2–4, anuṣṭubh 8
Although this hymn is found right in the middle of the Indra cycle, the Anukramaṇī assigns most of the verses in this hymn to the cows (1, 3–8c), with a few (2, 8d) to  the cows or Indra. The hymn was later used as a blessing for cows as they return  home, but it may originally have been intended to bless the cows given as a dakṣiṇā (priestly gift) as they enter the home of their new owner. According to the Vaitāna  Śrauta Sūtra 21.24, the sacrificer awaited the cows intended for the dakṣiṇā with the  hymn Atharvaveda IV.21 (=R̥V VI.28.1–7). It is worth noting that almost the last  word of the preceding hymn (VI.27.8d) is dákṣiṇā, and this may have invited the  placement of this hymn here.
The safety of the cows of the pious man as they graze is the subject of much of the  hymn, and the various dangers that could befall them are detailed: being stolen by a  thief or in a cattle raid, getting lost, going to the slaughterhouse. They are also given  rather grandiose identifications in verse 5, including with Indra: 5c is a clear echo,  almost to parody, of the famous hymn II.12 with its refrain: “he, o peoples, is Indra.”
The final verse is in a different meter, and as it is not part of the Atharvaveda  version of this hymn, it was probably originally separate. In form it is a magical  exhortation and makes use of the only slightly euphemistic verb upa-√pr̥c “mix  sexually.” The verse obviously expresses the wish that the cows become impreg
nated, and thus picks up the adjective “bearing offspring” in verses 2 and 7. The  use of the near deictic “right here” modifying “the inseminator” suggests that the  performance of the spell has a physical component in addition to the verbal, as is  regularly found in the Atharvaveda.
### 1
The cows have come here and have made (the house) blessed. Let them  find a place in the cow-stall; let them find enjoyment among us.
Here should those of many colors be, bearing offspring, as through
many dawns they give milk for Indra.
### 2
Indra does his best for the man who sacrifices and delivers in full. He  gives more; he does not steal what belongs to him.
Making wealth increase more and more just for him, he establishes the  man devoted to the gods in undivided virgin land.
### 3
These will not be lost, and no thief will take them by deception. No  enemy will venture against their meandering course.
Those (cows) with which he sacrifices and gives to the gods, he keeps  company with them as their cowherd for a very long time.
### 4
No dusty-necked steed gets to them (in a cattle raid), nor do they go to  the place for dressing [=slaughterhouse].
The cows of the mortal who sacrifices wander far across wide-ranging  (space) free of fear. 5. Fortune has appeared to me as cows; Indra as cows. The draught of the  first soma is cows.
These cows here—they, o peoples, are Indra. I am just searching, with  my heart and mind, for Indra.
### 6
You fatten even the thin man, o cows. You make even one without beauty  to have a lovely face.
You make the house blessed, o you of blessed speech. Your vigor is
declared loftily in the assemblies.
### 7
Bearing offspring, cropping good pasturage, drinking pure waters at a  good watering hole—
let not a thief be master of you, nor one who utters evil. Might the lance  of Rudra avoid you.
### 8
Right here is the inseminator: let there be inseminating right here in  these cows,
right here when the semen of the bull (is here), right here when your  virility (is here), o Indra.

29 (470) Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: triṣṭubh
The most notable feature in this hymn is the theme of “attachment,” which is played  with semantically and syntactically in verses 2–4. In verse 2 it is Indra’s own powers  that are attached to him, or rather to his hand (see also the mace in hand in vs. 1),  but in the following two verses ritual elements offered by men are the attachments.  Since the final verse (6) is a summary verse, introduced as often by evā́ “in this way,”  verses 2–4 constitute an omphalos defined by the attachment theme. Interestingly,  the only one of Indra’s great deeds mentioned in this hymn is his forceful separation of heaven and earth (vs. 5b), which provides a conceptual opposite to the attach
ment elsewhere.
The larger concern of the hymn is the reciprocal relation between men, who offer  Indra sacrifice and praise poetry, and Indra, who places his power in the service of  men and offers them gifts. This relationship is announced in the first verse, espe cially in the word “partnership, comradeship” in the first pāda, and is also conveyed  iconically by the “attachment” of the words “Indra” and “men,” which occur next  to each other initial in the opening pāda of the hymn, and again in 4c (índraṃ [vo]  náraḥ). The relationship between the god and his worshipers is here modeled on  that between the poet-sacrificer and his patron. Indra is in fact called a “patron” in  verse 5 and described as providing the priestly gift (dakṣiṇā) in verse 3, which is the  task and prerogative of a patron.814 VI.30
### 1
The men serve Indra for you [=patrons or priests] for the sake of his  partnership and benevolence, as they go on finding pleasure in the
great one,
for he whose hand holds the mace is the giver of a great (thing). Sacrifice  to the great and delightful one for help.
### 2
To which hand manly powers are firmly attached, (as) a chariot driver is  to his golden chariot,
(as) reins are to the two brawny fists, (as) bullish horses yoked together  are to the road.
### 3
For your glory do our friendly services firmly attach themselves to your  two feet [=do homage]. As the bold mace-bearer, (you) provide the
priestly gift;
wearing a fragrant cloak, (lovely) to be seen like the sun, you have
become vigorous, o dancer.
### 4
(But) the pressed soma has become the most firmly attached (to him),  in whose (presence) the cooked food is cooked and there are roasted  grains,
while the men who create the sacred formulations are praising Indra and  reciting their hymns as the men most cherished by the gods.
### 5
No limit has been set for this vast power of yours. He forced apart the  two world-halves with his greatness.
With his help our patron [=Indra] brings these things to fulfillment as he  keeps thrusting, as if driving his herds together to the waters.
### 6
Just in this way let lofty Indra be easily called—the warrior with golden  lips, with his help that needs no help,
for in this way was he born with unequalled, surpassing might. He will  strike down many obstacles [/Vr̥tras] and Dasyus.

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is entirely a celebration of Indra’s cosmogonic and cosmos-maintaining  deeds and powers. The only possible indications of a human dimension in the hymn  are the oblique reference to the soma sacrifice in the first pāda of the hymn, the  granting of good things in the second pāda, and the ruminative “I think” at the  beginning of the second verse. The pace of the hymn is brisk, but this straightfor
ward recital of the high points of Indra’s career has a pleasing balance and variety  in its expressions.
### 1
He has been strengthened even more for the heroic deed; he alone, the  unaging, apportions good things. Indra projects beyond heaven and earth: the two worlds are equivalent to  just half of him.
### 2
Therefore I think his lordly power to be lofty. Those things that he  upholds, no one alters.
Day after day the sun becomes visible. The strong-willed one distributed  the seats widely.
### 3
Even today, even now, this is the labor of the rivers, since you dug out a  way for them, Indra.
The mountains settled down like (flies) settling on food. By you were the  airy realms fixed fast, o you of strong will.
### 4
This is really true: there exists no other like you. Indra, no god nor  mortal is greater.
You smashed the serpent that lay around the flood; you sent the waters  surging toward the sea.
### 5
You (sent) forth the waters, (opened) wide the doors in every direction.  Indra, you broke the fastness of the mountain.
You became the king of the moving world and of the settled domains,  begetting at once the sun, heaven, and dawn.

Suhotra Bhāradvāja
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except śakvarī 4
This hymn begins by proclaiming Indra’s power over all peoples and all the cosmic  and earthly realms (vss. 1–2), before focusing on several of his famous battles and  the mortals he aided in them (vss. 3–4). The final verse exhorts Indra to perform the  same martial services for us.
The most interesting verse is the first, where at first glance the logical connec tions among the three clauses are not clear. But the contrast between the singleness  and unification of the first half of the verse and the division in the second seems  to be the point. Indra is the single lord of wealth because he can gather all peoples  just in his two hands—peoples who were otherwise disunited and quarreling over  the various goods of existence. Indra’s act of unification in this verse seems to be  a kind of wishful thinking on the poet’s part, however, for the battles depicted in  verses 3 and 4 are the result of disunity, and in verse 5 we call on Indra for aid in the  same sorts of disputations found in 1cd. The “separate peoples” (carṣaṇí) of verse  1 also return in verse 5; the poet wishes to see them as a sort of universal audience  for the fame of himself and his people, brought about by Indra’s intervention on  their behalf.
### 1
You, o wealth-lord, have become the single (lord) of wealth: you have  taken (all) the communities in your hands, Indra.
816 VI.32
The separate peoples, disputants, were disputing with each other over  progeny and posterity, the waters, and the sun.
### 2
Through fear of you, Indra, all the earthly realms, though unshakeable,  are brought to shaking.
Heaven and earth, the mountains, and the forests—all that is firmly fixed  takes fright at your drive.
### 3
You, Indra—fight along with Kutsa against the insatiable Śuṣṇa, the  demon of bad harvest, in the quest for cattle,
and against his ten before the (ritual) mealtime. Then you steal the wheel  of the sun. You have toiled at your labors.
### 4
You smashed down hundreds of impregnable fortresses of the Dasyu  Śambara,
when, able one, with your ability you did your best for Divodāsa the  presser and for Bharadvāja the singer, for (them to obtain) goods, o
you who can be bought with the pressing.
### 5
Mount your fearsome chariot, you real “real thing,” powerfully manly,  for the great battle.
O you in the vanguard, drive here toward me with your help, and
proclaim our fame, famous one, to the separate peoples.

5 verses: triṣṭubh
Unlike the common practice, whereby the final verse of the hymn constitutes the  poet’s summing up of his hymn, in this hymn the first verse serves this purpose, in  meta-relationship with what follows. The remaining verses, each of which begins  with the pronoun sá “he,” constitute the praise the poet announced in verse 1. Verses  2–3 refer to the Vala myth, with special attention paid to Indra’s companions in this  enterprise, the unnamed Aṅgirases, and verse 5 may be an oblique account of the  aftermath of the Vr̥tra slaying. In verse 4 Indra is exhorted to grant the singer pow
ers and riches.

their knees fixed.
Acting as comrade along with his comrades, the smasher of fortresses  broke the firmly fixed fortresses, being a poet along with poets.
### 4
As great one, drive here to the singer with (riches) to clothe (him), with  prizes, and with your great unbridled powers,
with (riches) bringing many heroes, o bull of the settlements, you who  long for songs—for good faring.

He, launched in a surge with power along with his coursers, Indra,  overcoming the precipitous, (sent) the waters (surging) to the right.

Śunahotra Bhāradvāja
5 verses: triṣṭubh
A martial hymn. The poet reminds Indra that he will receive entreaties for help  from all sides in the combat (vs. 2, using language almost identical to that in nearby  VI.31.1), but begs him to help our side alone, in battles and in contests. The poetry  is for the most part quite straightforward, except for the enigmatic expression in  verse 3 (probably not coincidentally the middle verse), in which Indra’s weapons  against formidable enemies appear to be “well-placed cloaks.” This expression has  been much discussed, and a number of scholars have opted to emend it. But it  likely refers to Indra’s penchant for shape-shifting disguises in combat. Moreover,  the word “well-placed” (súdhita) is phonologically close to a word for “hatchet”  (svádhiti), and this pun may well be lurking in the simile about trees.
### 1
What is the most mighty, o Indra, give that to us: your (battle-)ecstasy,  very superior and rich in gifts, o bull,
which, possessing good horses, will win a mass of good horses and will  defeat obstacles and enemies in battles.
### 2
For the separate peoples, disputants, call (separately) on you for help at  the contest of champions.
You dispersed the niggards through (the inspiration of) the inspired  poets, and it is just through your aid that the charger is the winner of  the prize.
### 3
You, o champion, smite both kinds of enemies, the Dāsa and the Ārya  obstacles,
like trees (with hatchets), with your well-placed cloaks. Break (them)  apart in the battles, o most manly of men.
818 VI.34
### 4
You, Indra—by your unstinting help become our lifelong companion  and helper for our strengthening,
when, in the winning of the sun, we call upon you as we fight, facing the  other side in battles, o champion.
### 5
(So) should you be for us, now and for the future, Indra. Be there for us  in mercy and in superiority.
Singing in just this way, might we be under the protection of the great  one and on the decisive day be the best winners of cattle.

Śunahotra Bhāradvāja
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The first verse of this hymn is a remarkably condensed expression of the poetic  economy:  Indra is both the recipient of praise songs and the source of inspira tion for those poetic thoughts. Moreover, all poets, past and present, vie to attract  Indra’s attention, each with his own poem. The rest of the hymn develops these  thoughts. Verses 2–3 continue the theme of multiple poets focusing on a single  object, Indra, and then provide a transition to the final two verses (4–5), which  celebrate the benefits that Indra receives from praise and sacrifice in a manner that  indicates that our praise and sacrifice are happening now.
### 1
Many songs have converged on you, Indra, and out from you go inspired  thoughts far and wide.
Previously and now, the seers’ songs of praise, their recitations and
hymns, have contended over Indra.
### 2
The skillful one, who is called upon by many and welcomed by many,  who alone is celebrated by many with sacrifices—
like a chariot yoked for great power, Indra is to be cheered on.

Indra, whom neither insightful thoughts nor voices harm; they just  approach him, making him strong.
When a hundred, when a thousand praisers sing to him who longs for  song, that is weal for him.

This is (weal) for him: seeking attachment, the soma has been set  firmly in Indra, like the two shining ones, (sun and) moon, in

Our invocations along with our sacrifices have entirely strengthened  (him), like a man in the desert when waters con(verge) on him.
### 5

so that, in the great overcoming of Vr̥tra [/obstacles], Indra will be our  lifelong helper and strengthener.

Nara Bhāradvāja
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Unlike the last hymn, which calmly contemplates the good our praise is doing for  Indra, this hymn inquires impatiently about the reward we should receive for this  activity, a mood conveyed by the peremptory questions of the first three verses and  the commands of verse 4.
The final verse (5) is syntactically very difficult and has given rise to a variety of inter pretations, especially of the first half-verse. We consider it a reference to the Vala myth  (as is clear at least in the mention of the Aṅgirases in d and also probably of the doors  in b): the poet hopes that the mythic opening of the Vala cave and the good things that  emerged from it will serve as a model for Indra’s wished-for bounties now. The “com munity” is probably both the poet’s own people and the Aṅgirases as comrades of Indra.
### 1
When will the sacred formulations find their resting place in the chariot?  When will you give to the praiser what will prosper a thousandfold?
When will you clothe his praise song with wealth? When will you make  his insights have prizes as jewels?
### 2
Just when will it be, Indra, that you will place in your own nest our men  with your men, our heroes with your heroes? Win the contests!
With cattle at stake, you will win cattle three times over. Indra, grant to  us sunlit brilliance.
### 3
Just when will it be, Indra, that you will make the sacred formulation  provided with all goods for the singer, o strongest one?
When will you team your teams, as (we do our) insights? When will you  go to the calls whose bounty is cattle?
### 4
Lay on for the singer nourishments whose bounty is cattle, whose glitter  is horses, whose fame is prizes of victory.
Swell the good-milking cow with refreshments, Indra. Might you make  them shine very bright among the Bharadvājas.
### 5
This community here and now do I sing, as (I did) also at another time,  when as champion, able one, you (opened) wide the doors.

5 verses: triṣṭubh
The first three verses follow the model of a “journey” hymn, but with a twist. The  fallow bays of verse 1 are Indra’s familiar horses, bringing his chariot to the sacri fice, but the same word (hárayaḥ) in verse 2 refers to the tawny soma drops. In verse  3 we return to the real horses, qualified as “charging straight on,” just like the soma  in the previous verse. The mention of Vāyu in verse 3 identifies the ritual in question  as the Morning Pressing.
The remaining two verses of the hymn (4–5) do not continue the journey theme.  Instead Indra is configured as a (divine) patron (vs. 5), who gives the priestly gift to  the (human) patrons (vs. 4). See VI.29 for a similar identification of Indra with the  sacrificial patron. 1. Close to here let your yoked fallow bays convey your chariot, which  brings all desirable things, mighty Indra,
for even the weakling calls upon you, (as well as the man) of solar glory.  Might we achieve success as your feasting companions today.
### 2
The fallow bays [=soma drops] have gone forth to their labor in the  wooden cup, and while being purified, they have come to be charging  straight on.
Indra should be the first to drink of this (soma) of ours, as the
heaven-ruling king of soma’s exhilaration.
### 3
Making their run here, the chariot-horses should convey powerful Indra  on (the chariot) with good wheels,
as they are charging straight on toward fame. Never should Vāyu’s
immortal (drink) give out.
### 4
Indra, the most excellent, the most powerfully ranging of the bounteous  ones, sets in motion his priestly gift—
with which, mace-bearer, you evade difficult straits and you apportion  bounties to our patrons, bold one.
### 5
Indra is the giver of the enduring prize. Let Indra increase through the  songs, his greatness increased;
let Indra be the best smiter of Vr̥tra [/the obstacle] as a consummate  warrior. Our patron brings these things to fulfillment as he keeps
thrusting.

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The context of this hymn is the morning ritual, and its aim is to attract Indra to it  by our invocation, which is the subject of the first two verses. In verse 1 Agni seems  to carry the invocation heavenward; in the second the invocation turns Indra here.  The strength Indra will derive from both praise and sacrifice occupy the next two  verses (3–4), and the final verse summarizes our attempts to attract him and the  benefits he will provide us.
Especially in the first two verses the poet is coy about reference, and the audience  must guess the subjects of the verbs and the referents of the pronouns until the last  pāda of verse 2.
### 1
He [=Agni?] has drunk from here; the most glittering one will carry up  our great, heaven-bright invocation to Indra.
On his journey he of good gifts will win a more admirable insightful  thought as present for the divine folk.
822 VI.39
### 2
Even from a distance, his two ears take residence here. It will sound— when speaking of Indra, it thunders:
this invocation to the gods should turn him—Indra—here toward me,  this one just now being recited.
### 3
With my highest insight, with my recitations I have roared for you to  ageless Indra, born of old.
Not only have the sacred formulations and the songs together been
placed in him, but in Indra the great praise puts strength.
### 4
Indra, whom the sacrifice will strengthen and the soma, (whom) the  sacred formulation will strengthen, and the songs, solemn words, and  thoughts—
so strengthen him at the coming of dawn from night. The months,
autumns, and days will strengthen Indra.
### 5
In just this way we now would seek to attract him here—him who was  born for vanquishing, who has been strengthened, and not by halves,  for famed generosity,
him, great and mighty, for help in the overcoming of obstacles [/Vr̥tra], o  inspired poet.

5 verses: triṣṭubh
Like the previous hymn, this one is tied to the here-and-now of the ritual situation;  also like the previous hymn, this one plays games with reference. The subject of the  hymn is really soma, but the word “soma” does not appear in it, and in the middle  verses of the hymn, which are insistently about soma, the poet intentionally mis
leads us about the referent.
In verse 1 a long series of adjectives in the genitive describing an unidentified being  is resolved by the verb “you have drunk”—the subject is Indra, and the genitive ref erent must be soma. The three middle verses (2–4) form an omphalos defined by  the repeated near deictic “this one here.” This pronoun should have a referent in the  immediate vicinity of the poet, but the first of these verses concerns what is clearly the  Vala myth, which invites the audience to supply Indra as the subject. It is only as the  sequence unfolds (and especially with the specification of “this one” as a “drop” in vs.  3) that it becomes clear that soma is taking the role of Indra is these verses.
For a similar covert coding of soma, there by the use of the genitive pronoun  asya “of it, of this one” see VI.27.1–2.
### 1
Of the gladdening poet, of the heavenly draft-horse, of the one of  inspired thought, of the speaking honey, of this companion of ours have you drunk, o god. Bind refreshments  tipped with cows to the singer.
### 2
This one here eagerly (breaks) the rock en(closing) the ruddy (cows),  as the one whose yoke is truth, having been yoked by those of true
insights;
he breaks apart the unbreakable back of the Vala cave. Indra will fight  against the Paṇis with words.
### 3
This drop here lights up the unlit nights in the evening and at dawn  through the autumns, o Indra.
This one they established to be ever the beacon of the days: he has made  the dawns to have blazing birth.
### 4
This one here, himself shining, makes the unshining ones shine. This one  makes the many (dawns) dawn forth through truth.
This one speeds with his horses whose yoke is truth, with his sun-finding  (wheel-)nave, as he fills the domains.
### 5
Being sung now, ancient king, swell many refreshments for the giving of  good things to the singer.
Give waters, plants without poison, trees, cows, chargers, and men for  the praising.

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is for the most part a typical invitation to Indra, to drive to our sacrifice  and drink the soma. However, it is chronologically backward. The first two verses  urge Indra to drink, the first opening with a peremptory command, “Indra, drink!”  The next two verses (3–4) command Indra to “drive here,” the logically prior action.  Only in the last verse do the two actions occur together, in the temporally appropri
ate order. The imperative “drink!” (píba) found as the second word in the hymn is  matched in the last pāda of the hymn by another imperative “take a drink” (pāhi),  likewise second in its pāda, both verbs formed to the same root but in the present  and aorist systems respectively.
Note also the reciprocal expressions in the final pādas of verses 1 and 4: in verse  1 it is Indra who will create vitality for the singer and the sacrifice; in verse 4 by  contrast the sacrifice creates vitality for Indra.
The final word of the hymn, “with the Maruts,” establishes the Midday Pressing  as the ritual in question. The Maruts are also obliquely referred to in the first verse,  in the phrase “amid your troop.”
### 1
Indra, drink! It is pressed for you for your exhilaration. Unhitch your  two fallow bays; let loose your two partners.824 VI.41
And sing forth here having sat down amid your troop. Then create
vitality for the singer for sacrifice.
### 2
Drink of this, of which you drank when you were just born, Indra, for  your exhilaration and for your resolve, o you who confer abundance. This drop have the cows, the men, the waters, and the stone together  impelled for you—for it to be fully drunk.
### 3
With the fire kindled, Indra, the soma has been pressed. Let your fallow  bays, the best conveyors, convey you here.
With a mind seeking you, I call upon you again and again. Drive here,  Indra, for our great good faring.
### 4
Drive here. Over and over you have driven with your great and eager  mind to the soma-drinking, Indra.
You will listen to these sacred formulations of ours, and then the
sacrifice will create vitality for your body.
### 5
When, Indra, on the decisive day, whether (you are) remote or in your  own seat, or wherever you are ...
from there (drive) with your team to our sacrifice to help us. Take a
drink, joined in revelry with the Maruts, o you who long for the songs.

Another invitation to Indra to drink the soma. The usual “drive” theme is also  present (vss. 1, 4, 5), but backgrounded. The emphasis is on the attractions of the  particular soma offered. Only in the last pāda of the last verse does the poet ask  Indra for something in return.
### 1
Free of anger, drive here to the sacrifice. For you do the pressed soma  drops purify themselves.
Like cows toward their own home, o mace-bearer, come here, Indra, as  the first of those worthy of the sacrifice.
### 2
Your throat, which is well-fashioned, which is the widest, with which you  are always drinking the wave of honey,
take a drink with it. The Adhvaryu has set (the soma) forth for you. Let  your mace turn itself to the pursuit of cows, Indra.
### 3
This drop, the soma, a bull of all colors, has been brought to perfection  for bullish Indra.
Drink it, o powerful master of bays, (chariot-)mounter—this of which  you are master from of old, which is your food. 4. Pressed soma is better than unpressed, Indra, and this (soma) here is  even better, for the discriminating to enjoy.
Drive here to this sacrifice, you overcomer. Through it fulfill all your  powers.
### 5
We are calling you, Indra: drive nearby. The soma will be fit for
your body.
O you of a hundred resolves, bring yourself to exhilaration on the
pressed (drinks). Further us in battles and among the clans.

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
4 verses: anuṣṭubh 1–3, brhat ̥ ī 4
Yet another hymn concerned almost entirely with Indra’s soma-drinking, but unlike  the immediately preceding hymns, Indra is not directly urged to come and drink the  soma. Rather, Indra is in the 3rd person throughout, and commands are issued to  a single individual (vss. 1, 4) and to a group (vss. 2–3), to serve Indra. None of the  addressees is identified until verse 4, with its vocative addressing the Adhvaryu. He  is likely therefore also to be the addressee in verse 1; presumably the priests as a  whole are addressed by the plural imperatives in the internal verses.
In this otherwise ritually focused hymn, the very specific anxiety expressed in  the last half-verse comes as some surprise, a surprise mirrored in the meter, with  the 12/8 half-verse contrasting with the 8/8 structure that has prevailed throughout.  This wondering question about Indra’s possible aid against the boastful slanderer  functionally fills the usual hymn-final slot of direct plea to the god for help, despite  its indirection.
### 1
Present (it) to him who desires to drink, who knows all things,
to the superior man who comes fittingly, who comes regularly, who does  not lag behind.
### 2
Go toward him, the best of the soma-drinkers, with the soma juices, to Indra possessing the silvery drink, with tankards, with the
pressed drops.
### 3
When you attend on him with the pressed soma drops,
the wise one knows of it all, but he boldly hastens just to that one
[=soma].
### 4
Just to this one here [=Indra], o Adhvaryu, bring forth the pressed (juice)  of the stalk.
Surely he will rescue (us) from the calumny of anyone who boastfully  claims high breeding?

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
4 verses: uṣṇih
A simple hymn, in which the refrain (pāda c of each verse) offers Indra soma to  drink, and the first half of each verse consists of a definitional relative clause refer ring to Indra’s deeds in his soma-exhilaration. As often, the pattern set in the rest  of the hymn is modified but not entirely broken in the final verse: verses 1–3 contain  the syntagm yásya...máda- “(in) whose exhilaration,” while the final verse substi tutes the participle mandāná “finding exhilaration” for the etymologically related  noun máda, and also inserts a part of the soma plant, its stalk, on which the relative  pronoun is dependent.
### 1
In whose exhilaration you subdued Śambara for Divodāsa—
here is that soma, Indra, pressed for you. Drink!
### 2
Whose sharp-pressed exhilaration, whose middle and end, you guard— here is that soma, Indra, pressed for you. Drink!
### 3
In whose exhilaration you set loose from the rock the cows fixed firm  within—
here is that soma, Indra, pressed for you. Drink!
### 4
Finding exhilaration in whose stalk, you acquire the capacity for  generosity—
here is that soma, Indra, pressed for you. Drink!

Śaṃyu Bārhaspatya
24 verses: anuṣṭubh 1–6, triṣṭubh or virāj 7, 9, virāj 8, triṣṭubh 10–24, arranged in trcas ̥
A composite hymn placed toward the end of the Indra cycle in Maṇḍala VI, the  hymn consists of eight tr̥cas, the first two (vss. 1–6) in anuṣṭubh, the third (vss. 7–9)  in a mixture of triṣṭubh and virāj, and the remaining five (vss. 10–24) in triṣṭubh.  Several of the tr̥cas are rhetorically unified: 1–3 with its repeated second half-verse  following a definitional relative clause; 19–21 with its insistent “bull” theme; 22–24  with its repeated half-verse-initial “this one here” (ayám) referring to soma. The  others have less obvious internal unity, though there is often a continuity of theme  or subject. There is also no visible external unity among the tr̥cas collected in this  “hymn,” though it seldom strays far from Indra and the soma-drinking, the topic of  many of the immediately preceding hymns. Indeed, Oldenberg (1888: 203) suggests  that VI.44 owes its position to the similarity between the refrain of its first tr̥ca and  the refrain of VI.43. 1. The one that is wealthiest, o wealthy one, that is most brilliant through  its brilliance,
the pressed soma—that is your exhilarating drink, o Indra, lord of
independent power.
### 2
The capable one that is yours, o powerfully capable one, the giver of  wealth and of thoughts,
the pressed soma—that is your exhilarating drink, o Indra, lord of
independent power.
### 3
The one through which (you are) like one grown strong by (his own)  power and like one overpowering by his own forms of help,
the pressed soma—that is your exhilarating drink, o Indra, lord of
independent power.
### 4
I will sing for you to this lord of power, who never smites (us) away, to Indra, the all-conquering superior man, most bounteous, possessing  all domains.
### 5
He whom songs make strong, the lord of overpowering generosity— his tempestuous force do the two world-halves, the goddesses, respect. 6. It (is mine) to lay on your behalf, with the power of solemn speech, the  underlayer for Indra,
whose forms of helps are like inspired words, since, dwelling together,  they spread apart in their ascent.
### 7
Our newer ally [=Soma] has found the skill. Having been drunk, he has  perceived what is better for the gods.
Having won with the brawny racers [?], in making broad shelter he
became a protector for his comrades.
### 8
On the path of truth, the ritual adept has been drunk. The gods have  set their minds for glory.
Acquiring the name of “great” by (ritual) speeches, the one worthy of  the quest has disclosed his wondrous form to be seen.
### 9
Bestow the most brilliant skill on us. Repel the many hostilities of the  peoples.
Make our vitality higher through your abilities. Help us in the winning  of the stake.
### 10
Indra, we have become ready just for you, the giver, you generous  possessor of the fallow bays. Do not lose the track.
No one has shown himself as our friend among mortals. Do they not  call you a rouser (even) of the weak?
### 11
Give us not to exhaustion, bull. Let us not come to harm in our  comradeship with you, the wealthy.
Many are the tributes for you among the peoples, Indra. Smite the
non-pressers; rip away those who don’t deliver.
828 VI.44
### 12
Like the thunderer the rain clouds, Indra stirs up bounties of horses  and cattle.
It is you who provide nourishment to the bard from of old. Let those  without gifts not trick you away from (our) benefactor.
### 13
O Adhvaryu, hero, give of the pressed (soma drinks) to great Indra, for  he is its king,
he who has grown strong by the previous and the present songs of  singing seers.
### 14
In its exhilaration, knowing many shapes, Indra smashed unopposable  obstacles.
Pour forth for him the honeyed soma, for the belipped hero to drink. 15. Let Indra be the one who drinks the pressed soma, who smashes the  obstacle [/Vr̥tra] with his mace in his exhilaration,
who goes to the sacrifice, even from far away, who is the good helper of  insights, providing nourishment to the bard.
### 16
Here is this drinking cup, giving drink to Indra. Indra’s dear immortal  (drink) has been drunk,
so that it will exhilarate the god for the sake of his good favor and will  keep hatred and constraint away from us.
### 17
Becoming exhilarated by it, o champion, smash your rivals and your  foes, both kin and non-kin, o bounteous one.
Those with weapons aimed at us, setting their sights on us—pulverize  and smash them, Indra, (for them to become) far away.
### 18
Once more, in these our battles, bounteous Indra, make for us a great  wide space and easy passage.
Go halves with our patrons, Indra, in the conquering of the waters, of  life and lineage.
### 19
Your fallow bays, the bulls that have been yoked, the steeds with their  bullish chariot and with their bullish reins,
the bulls that convey your mace—let them, well-yoked, convey you here  in our direction for bullish exhilaration.
### 20
The bulls have mounted the wooden cup for you, o bull, like waves  spraying ghee as they bring exhilaration.
Indra, to you, the bullish bull, they present soma from out of the  (drops) pressed by bulls.
### 21
You are the bullish bull of heaven and of earth, the bullish bull of the  rivers and of the standing waters.
O bull, for bullish you the drop has swelled, the sweet sap, the honeyed  drink, to your liking.
### 22
This god here, being born with strength, with Indra as his yokemate,  blocked the Paṇi [/niggard]. This one here, the drop, stole the weapons of his own father, the tricks  of the unkindly one.
### 23
This one gave the dawns a good husband; this one placed light within  the sun.
This one found the threefold immortal one hidden in heaven among the  third realms of light.
### 24
This one propped apart heaven and earth; this one yoked the chariot  with seven reins.
This one, Soma, by his ability, secures the cooked (milk) within the
cows, the wellspring with its ten fastenings: Soma!

Śaṃyu Bārhaspatya
33 verses: gāyatrī, except atinicrt 29, anu ̥ ṣṭubh 33, arranged in trcas ̥
Like the preceding hymn, this one is composed of tr̥cas, the first ten to Indra, the  last one (vss. 31–33) a dānastuti to the patron Br̥bu. Given its position in the Indra  cycle, it is unlikely to have been originally a single hymn, but there are some themes  that keep recurring throughout the hymn, such as the comparison of Indra with a  cow or calf (vss. 7, 22, 25–26, 28), the sacred formulation as a vehicle for Indra (vss.  4, 7, 19), and the stake that is set as a prize in a contest (vss. 2, 11–13, 15). However,  rhetorical unity within tr̥cas seems almost entirely lacking.
### 1
Who with good leading led Turvaśa and Yadu here from afar,
he is Indra, our youthful comrade.
### 2
Placing vitality even in the uninspired, even with a steed lacking speed, Indra is the winner of the stake that is set.
### 3
Great is his guidance and many are the encomia for him.
His help does not perish.
### 4
Comrades, chant and sing forth to him whose vehicle is the sacred  formulation,
for he is great solicitude for us.
### 5
You, o Vr̥tra-smasher, are the helper of one, of two,
and for such as we are.
### 6
Only you lead (us) beyond hatreds; you make (us) proclaimers of solemn  speech;
and you are called rich in heroes by superior men.
### 7
To the formulator whose vehicle is the sacred formulation, to the  comrade worthy of verses
do I call with my songs, as to a cow to be milked,
830 VI.45
### 8
In whose two hands all good things are at home, now as before— (in the hands) of the hero, victorious in battles.
### 9
(Tear) apart even the strongholds of the peoples, o possessor of the  stone and lord of power;
tear (apart) their tricks, you who can’t be bowed.
### 10
It is just you, o Indra, you real one, you drinker of soma and lord of  prizes,
that we have called upon, seeking fame—
### 11
Just you, who were before or who are now to be called upon when the  stake is set.
Hear our call!
### 12
With insights as our steeds, (might we win) steeds and prizes worthy of  fame, o Indra;
with you might we win the stake that is set.
### 13
You became great when the stake was set, o Indra, you hero who longs  for songs,
and the one worth tussling for at the raid.
### 14
Your help that has the quickest speed, o smasher of foes—
with that impel our chariot.
### 15
As the best charioteer, with our chariot on the attack,
win, o winner, the stake that is set.
### 16
Praise only him, who alone was born as the limitless lord of the  separate peoples,
having a bullish will.
### 17
You who were the only friend with help, the kindly comrade of the  singers,
have mercy on us, Indra.
### 18
Set your mace in your hands to smash the demons, mace-bearer. You should overpower your opponents.
### 19
The ancient yokemate of riches, the comrade who spurs on the weak, the one who most has the sacred formulation as his vehicle—upon him  do I call.
### 20
For he alone is lord of all the good things of the earth,
the rich one who most longs for songs.
### 21
(Coming) here with your teams, fulfill our desire with prizes of horses and of cows, lord of cows, acting boldly.
### 22
Sing this at the pressing to the warrior called upon by many, (this) that is weal for the able one as if for a cow.
### 23
The good one will not hold back his gift of a prize of cattle when he will hear these songs. 24. For the smiter of Dasyus will certainly go forth to somebody’s cattle  enclosure;
with his powers he will open it up.
### 25
These songs bellow out again and again to you, o you of a hundred  resolves,
like mothers to their calf, Indra.
### 26
Partnership with you is difficult to attain. You are, o hero, the cow for  him who seeks cattle.
Become the horse for him who seeks horses.
### 27
Find exhilaration from the stalk, then, to show great generosity with  your own person.
You will not put your praiser to scorn.
### 28
These songs come near to you at every pressing, o you who long  for songs,
as milk-cows do their calf—
### 29
(You,) the first among many at the verbal contest of the many
praiser-singers,
who compete for the prize with their prizes.
### 30
Let ours be the praise song that best conveys you nearest, Indra. Impel us toward great wealth.
### 31
Br̥bu has stood upon the highest head of the niggards [/Paṇis];
(he is) as broad of girth as the Ganges—
### 32
(He) whose propitious gift in the thousands, at a speed like the wind’s, is ready for giving all at once.
### 33
So then do all our bards always hymn here, away from (the sacrifice) of  the stranger,
Br̥bu, the best giver of thousands, the patron, the best winner of
thousands.

Śaṃyu Bārhaspatya
14 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas
Like the previous two hymns, this one has too many verses for its position in the  Indra cycle, though its division into the two-verse pragātha units may account for  its placement. Nonetheless, the hymn seems to be a conceptual unity, rather than a  collection of independent pragāthas.
The hymn concentrates on Indra as the helper of his praisers in contests and in  battles. He is exhorted to come to our aid, to provide us with protection, to bring
832 VI.46
us the power inhering in rival peoples (see especially vss. 7–8), and to help us defeat  our foes. The hymn is without major complications, and the theme is more repeated  than developed. This regular repetition gives the hymn an unhurried pace, which  contrasts with the urgency of the contests and battles described. This pace begins  to quicken in the last verses: the repeated phrase introducing an imperative, “So  then, as ever” (vss. 10, 11, 12), seems to be building to a finale. But the last pragātha  (vss. 13–14), rather than providing the expected climactic plea to Indra for aid that  would end the hymn conventionally, is instead a two-verse subordinate clause about  Indra and his racing horses that utterly lacks a main clause, and it displays a den sity of imagery, with unrelated similes piled up pell-mell, that seems designed to  replicate the breathless pace of a real contest—a remarkable effect. At the same  time, it harkens back to the beginning of the hymn, with its mention of steeds and  the racecourse (see vs. 1) and the “great stakes” (see vs. 4), so that the apparently  reckless speed and lack of completion of the final two verses is contained within a  ring-compositional structure.
### 1
Because it is just you that we bards call upon at the winning of  the prize,
you, Indra, as master of settlements that our men (call upon) amid
obstacles, you at the finish lines of our steed,
### 2
So you—o dazzling one with mace in hand, o possessor of the stone,  being praised as the great one—boldly
heap up for us cow, horse, and chariotry altogether like a prize for the  winner, o Indra.
### 3
The unbounded one who smites altogether, that Indra do we call upon. O you possessing a thousand testicles, of powerful manliness, master of  settlements—be there to strengthen us in the combats.
### 4
Like a bull, you press the peoples hard with your battle fury at the  spirited competition, o you who are equal to song.
Become our helper at the (contest for) great stakes, at (the contest for)  our bodies, the waters, and the sun.
### 5
Indra, bring us the best, the mightiest, fulfilling fame,
with which you, o dazzling one with mace in hand, fill both these
world-halves, o you of good lips.
### 6
It is you, the mighty conqueror of the bordered domains, that we call  upon to help, o king among the gods.
Make all our things that waver gain foothold and our foes be easily
conquered, o good one.
### 7
The might and manliness that are in the Nahuṣa territories, Indra, or the brilliance that belongs to the five settlements—bring them here: all  the masculine powers altogether. 8. Or what bullish power is in Tr̥kṣi and in the Druhyu people, or whatever  is in the Pūru, o bounteous one,
grant that to us fully at (the time of) the conquering of men, for us to  vanquish our foes in battles.
### 9
O Indra, your threefold, triple-armored shelter that provides
well-being—
that protection hold out to our benefactors and to me. Keep the arrow  away from those
### 10
Who, with their mind set on cattle, outwit their rival and smite him  boldly.
So then, as ever, o bounteous Indra longing for songs, as the protector  of our bodies, come up close to us.
### 11
So then, as ever, be there to strengthen us. Indra, help our leader in  the fight,
when the feathered, sharp-headed arrows fly in the midspace,
### 12
Where champions stretch wide their own dear bodies as shelter for their  ancestors.
So then, as ever, hold out protection to our body and lineage. Keep
away unforeseen hatred.
### 13
When, Indra, at the charge, you will spur on your steeds at the (contest  for) great stakes,
on an uncrowded (race)course, on its twisting path, like falcons
hunting fame,
### 14
(The steeds) going swiftly like rivers in a torrent when (the chariot?) has  sounded following their roar,
who, like birds over raw flesh, keep circling (the racecourse), being held  firm in the cow [=leather (reins)] in your two arms...

Garga Bhāradvāja
31 verses: triṣṭubh, except brhat ̥ ī 19, anuṣṭubh 23, gāyatrī 24, dvipadā 25, jagatī 27
Like III.53, the family hymn of the Viśvāmitras, dedicated primarily to Indra and  placed at the end of the Indra cycle in Maṇḍala III, this hymn is the family hymn of  the Bharadvājas, dedicated primarily to Indra and also positioned at the end of the  Indra cycle in its maṇḍala. Also like III.53, VI.47 consists of a number of smaller  units, some of which seem to have little or no connection with each other. Different  scholars have suggested different divisions of the hymn; our own is based in great  part on arguments based on rhetoric.834 VI.47
It begins with an extravagant praise of soma (vss. 1–5), rhetorically unified by  the oft-repeated pronoun “this one here” (ayám), which in several of its occurrences  takes an unusual final position (as opposed to its standard initial slot). With the  presence of soma unquestionably established, Indra is then invited to drink it in  the following verse (6), with the ritual context explicitly identified as the Midday  Pressing. In fact already toward the end of the soma verses, there has been a modu
lation toward Indra: several of the deeds attributed to “this one here” are more  Indraic than Somian, especially the propping of heaven in 5cd, and the final words  of verse 5 “the bull accompanied by the Maruts” would ordinarily uniquely identify  Indra, who is addressed in the next pāda (6a).
The extended middle section of the hymn (vss. 7–21) is entirely devoted to Indra.  Verses 7–10 contain a series of direct pleas, for Indra to lead us forward to wider  space and a better life and to provide refreshment and a good life. The next three  verses (11–13) are similarly general, but couched in the 3rd person. (Two of these  verses [12–13] are repeated in a very late hymn, X.131.6–7, and in turn are used in  the later Sautrāmaṇī ritual, but we see no direct evidence of that ritual here.) Indra  appears in these verses as a sort of universal protector and helper. This character
ization seems to raise questions in the poet’s mind: if Indra is the protector of all,  then how does any particular group get ahead?
This implicit question prompts the next, somewhat jarring, section of the hymn  (vss. 14–19), which concerns the fickle and unpredictable way in which Indra’s  patronage flits from one man to another. The section begins undramatically by  announcing the many verbal and ritual offerings to Indra, coming (it seems) from  many different groups (vs. 14), all seeking his aid. The next verse (15) seems to treat  Indra’s capriciousness as a positive trait: he doesn’t only and always aid the strong,  but will frequently promote a man who has fallen behind. The next two verses (16– 17) continue this theme, but with Indra’s behavior appearing in a darker light, as he  arbitrarily breaks his agreements and betrays his followers. In the following verse  (18) Indra is infinitely multiplied, presenting a different appearance to each differ
ent group and seemingly possessed of a thousand horses, each pair of which might  take him to a different group pleading for his aid. This somewhat disturbing section  is brought to a happy end in verse 19: only one pair of horses is yoked (to bring  Indra to us?), the various forms are under Tvaṣṭar’s control, and in the rhetorical  question that forms the second half-verse (matching the question in vs. 15)  it is  concluded that Indra is unlikely to stay with the enemy when our own patrons are  now providing such a good sacrifice. One of the most notable aspects of this little  section (esp. vss. 15–18) about Indra’s constantly changing behavior is its grammati cal reflection: these verses are packed with āmreḍita nominal compounds “each x,  x after x” and so-called “intensive” verb forms (really iterative-frequentative, mean
ing “keeps x-ing, continually x-es”), forms that are relatively marked in the Vedic  grammatical system. The presence of four āmreḍitas and four intensives in four  verses both calls attention to the message and reflects it by portraying a regularly  alternating set of actions and objects. The reassurance of verse 19 has come none too soon, for in verse 20 the poet  and his group find themselves in a bad spot, not the wide and bountiful place they  prayed Indra to lead them to in verses 7–8. In verse 21 the opposing forces are over come (by Indra, it seems, though he is unnamed). Thus, verses 7–8 and 20–21 form  a larger ring around the Indra section.
A dānastuti follows (vss. 22–25), in which the victorious kings distribute the  bounty won in the battle referred to in verse 21. The dānastuti proceeds briskly and  efficiently, without any of the jocularity commonly found in dānastutis elsewhere,  just a list of the acquisitions.
The last part of the hymn (vss. 26–31) is the strangest. It consists of three verses  (26–28) addressed to the war chariot and three (29–31) addressed to the war drum.  These verses are also found in the Atharvaveda (VI.125–126). Each of these martial  objects is praised in the most extravagant terms and compared with the attributes  of the gods. Although this section seems to have no direct connection with the rest  of the hymn, it may have been attached to the hymn (or even originally composed  as part of it) in response to the battle depicted in verses 20–21 and the distribution  of booty in verses 22–25. Chariots are part of the gift (24a), and it would not be  surprising that a war drum might be allotted as part of the post-battle distribution.  It is also worth remembering that in III.53, the family hymn of the Viśvāmitras  mentioned above, one of the final sections (vss. 17–20) is devoted to the possible  perils besetting a chariot and its team, with phraseology similar to verses 26–28 in  this hymn.
### 1
Sweet is this one, certainly, and it is honeyed; sharp is this one, certainly,  and it is full of sap.
And now that Indra has drunk of it, no one at all overcomes him at the  challenges.
### 2
This sweet one here was the most exhilarating, on which Indra became  exhilarated for the smashing of Vr̥tra,
he who (having performed) many exploits smashed apart the nine and  ninety walls of Śambara.
### 3
This one, when it is drunk, rouses my speech; it has awakened an eager  inspired thought.
This wise one measured out the six broad (realms), from which no world  is at a distance.
### 4
This is the one who created the expanse of the earth; who created the  height of heaven is this one here;
this one (created) the beestings on the three slopes [=worlds?]. Soma  upheld the broad midspace.
### 5
This one found the flood with its brilliant appearance at the (fore)front  of the dawns with their gleaming seats.
This one, great, with a great pillar propped up heaven—he, the bull,  accompanied by the Maruts.
836 VI.47
### 6
Boldly drink the soma in the tub, Indra—as smasher of Vr̥tra at the  confluence of goods, o champion.
At the Midday Pressing, drench yourself. Standing amid wealth,  establish wealth in us.
### 7
Indra, look forward for us, like the man who goes ahead; lead us further  forward, toward a better state.
Become one of good passage, who gives us passage beyond; become  one of good guidance and valued guidance.
### 8
Lead us along to a wide world, as the one who knows—to sun-filled  light, to fearlessness, to well-being.
High are the arms of you who are stalwart, Indra. Might we approach  these two lofty shelters.
### 9
Place us in the widest chariot box, Indra, on the two best-pulling  horses, you possessor of hundreds.
Convey hither the highest refreshment of refreshments. Let our  (refreshment) not cross over to the “riches of the stranger,”
bounteous one.
### 10
Indra, be gracious. Seek a means of life for me. Spur on my poetic  vision like a blade of copper.
Whatever I say here in devotion to you, just this enjoy. Make me  accompanied by the gods.
### 11
Indra the protector, Indra the helper, Indra the champion good to call  at every call—
I call on Indra, the able one, called on by many. Let bounteous Indra  establish well-being for us.
### 12
Let Indra be of good protection, of good help with his help, very  gracious, affording all possessions.
Let him thrust away hatred; let him create fearlessness. Might we be  lords of good heroes in abundance.
### 13
Might we be in the favor of him who deserves the sacrifice, in his  propitious benevolence.
Let Indra of good protection, of good help to us keep hatred away even  from a distance.
### 14
Down to you, Indra, run the hymns and the sacred formulations as  teams, like a wave along the slopes.
As broad as your bounty are the many pressings. You join together the  waters, the cows, and the drops, you possessor of the mace.
### 15
Who will praise him, who will fill him, who will sacrifice to him, if the  bounteous one would always help only the strong?
Like one who puts down his two feet one after the other, with his  powers he makes the one who was behind to be in front.
### 16
He is famed as a hero who subdues every strong one, continually  leading the one beyond the other in turn. Hating the flashy, king of both (races [=human and divine]), Indra
keeps prodding the clans, the sons of Manu—first one, then
the other.
### 17
He twists away from his partnerships with those in front; continually  double-crossing them, he goes with those behind.
Indra keeps enduring through the many autumns, shaking them
[=autumns] off so they don’t close in.
### 18
He has a form corresponding to every form; this form of his is for  display.
Indra keeps going about in many forms through his magical powers, for  ten hundred fallow bays are yoked for him.
### 19
Having yoked the two fallow bay mares to his chariot, Tvaṣṭar rules  over the many (forms) here.
Who will always sit on the side of the hostile—and especially when
(our) patrons are sitting (a sacrificial session)?
### 20
We have come here to a field without pasturage, o gods. Though it was  wide, the land has become narrow.
O Br̥haspati, o Indra, be on the lookout for a path for the singer who is  in this state on his quest for cattle.
### 21
Day after day he drove off from their seat the other half, the black  kindred all of the same appearance.
The bull smashed the two Dāsas, mercenaries, Varcin and Śambara, at  the moated place.
### 22
Prastoka from your bounty, Indra, has just now given ten casks, ten  prizewinners.
From Divodāsa, (son?) of Atithigva, we have accepted as bounty the  goods belonging to Śambara.
### 23
Ten horses, ten casks, ten garments, with delights on top—
ten golden balls have I gained from Divodāsa.
### 24
Ten chariots with side-horses, a hundred cows
has Aśvatha given to the Atharvans, to Pāyu.
### 25
The descendant of Sr̥ñjaya has reached toward the Bharadvājas, who  have acquired great bounty belonging to all people.
### 26
O tree, because you should become firm-limbed, a comrade to us,  furthering (us), affording good heroes,
you are knotted together with cows [=leather (straps)]. Be firm! Let the  one who mounts you win what is to be won.
### 27
Strength has been brought up from heaven, from earth; might has been  brought here from the trees.
To the strongness of the waters enclosed by cows, to the mace of
Indra—to the Chariot—sacrifice with an oblation.
838 VI.48
### 28
The mace of Indra, the face of the Maruts, the embryo of Mitra, the  navel of Varuṇa—
taking pleasure in this oblation-giving of ours, god Chariot, accept our  oblations.
### 29
Make Heaven and Earth gasp. Let the moving (world [=living
creatures]) dispersed in many places pay attention to you.
O Drum, along with Indra, with the gods, drive away the rivals farther  than far.
### 30
Roar out your power. Set strength in us. Thunder down, thrusting away  difficulties.
Blast away misfortunes from here, o Drum. You are the fist of
Indra: be firm!
### 31
Drive those yonder [=cows] hither and make the ones here turn back.  The Drum keeps speaking, giving the signal.
Our men, with horses as their wings, are converging: (so) let our
charioteers win, o Indra.

22 verses: various lyric meters, arranged for the most part in pragāthas
Another curious hymn, made up of apparently disparate sections and composed  in a variety of different lyric meters. The headnote above reproduces the dedicands  suggested by the Anukramaṇī, but they do not exactly fit the contents of the hymn.  The first ten verses, dedicated to Agni, seem a conventional Agni hymn, the curios
ity being that it is not placed among the other Agni hymns. It is also metrically the  most stable portion of the hymn, with paired pragātha verses alternating br̥hatī and  satobrḥatī, save for verses 6–8, where each verse has an extra eight-syllable pāda at  the end.
The next three verses (11–13) offer an odd interlude: the priestly associates of the  poet are ordered to drive a cow nearby, who will give milk for the Maruts. Although  the Anukramaṇī identifies the Maruts as the dedicands of these verses, they seem  incidental. The focus is on the cow—whether as a metaphor for Bharadvāja’s poetic  inspiration, as a real cow meant to provide the milk to mix with soma in the ongoing  sacrifice, or as both. This cow is reminiscent of the apparent cow in the extremely  enigmatic verses of the Viśvāmitra family hymn (III.53.15–16), a hymn that occu
pies a similar place in its maṇḍala.
Pūṣan is the subject of verses 14–19, the heart of the hymn. As Geldner points  out, the Bharadvājas have a special relationship with Pūṣan: Maṇḍala VI contains the only series of hymns devoted to that god (VI.53–58). The first two verses of  this section (14–15) present a solemn, formal praise of Pūṣan, who is compared to  the great Vedic gods in his various qualities, despite his usual rustic and relatively  lowly status. The two verses clearly form a pragātha, though the second of them  (vs. 15) has five pādas (12 12 12 8 8) rather than the expected satobr̥hatī (12 8 12 8).  After these two straightforward verses, notable only for the hyperbolic encomium  of this minor divinity, there follow three verses (16–18) containing a remarkable,  intimate address to Pūṣan, whispered into his ear (see 16ab), some of which, espe cially verse 17, is close to unintelligible. The translation of that verse given here is  extremely provisional; what is clear is that the style and syntax are informal, and  the poet probably uses idioms and popular sayings current in colloquial speech.  Moreover, since it is whispered to Pūṣan, it should be unintelligible to us. The final  verse devoted to Pūṣan (19), though it remains a 2nd-person address, returns to the  high, formal style of the first two (14–15) and is in br̥hatī. It should be noted that  the three intimate verses have the same metrical structure as the three verses about  the cow (11–13) and share with those verses a certain idiomatic register. Each con sists of a sequence of kakubh (8 12 8: vss. 11, 16), satobr̥hatī (12 8 12 8: vss. 12, 17),  and puraüṣṇih (12 8 8: vss. 13, 18).
The final three verses (20–22) are dedicated to the Maruts. The first two form  another pragātha (20 in the expected br̥hatī, 22 with an extra eight-syllable pāda at  the end, like the extended satobr̥hatīs of vss. 6 and 8), while the final verse (22) is in  anuṣṭubh. The reason for their position here is unclear. The final verse is enigmatic,  as verses referring the Maruts’ mother Pr̥śni and their birth often are (cf. II.34.2  and especially nearby VI.66.1), and the hymn, having presented us with a number  of puzzles along the way, ends with a final one.
### 1
With your every sacrifice to Agni, and with your every hymn to his skill, we—that is, I—have proclaimed time after time the immortal Jātavedas,  dear like an ally.
### 2
The child of nourishment—because he is inclined toward us, that one all  on his own—we would ritually serve, for the bestowal of oblations.
He will become our helper in the prize-contests; he will become the  strengthener and protector of our bodies.
### 3
Because, Agni, as a great unaging bull, you radiate widely with
your beam,
constantly flaming up with your untiring flame, o flame-bright one, shine  bright with your bright lights.
### 4
You sacrifice to the great gods: sacrifice in due order with your resolve  and wondrous power.
Bring them nearby for help, Agni. Bestow prizes and win them.
### 5
Whom the waters, the stones, and the trees carry to term as the embryo  of truth,
840 VI.48
who is born, when he is churned mightily by men, on the back of  the earth,
### 6
Who has filled both world-halves with his radiance, he races to heaven  with his smoke;
he is seen across the darkness in the nights, a ruddy bull among the  dusky ones,
a ruddy bull toward the dusky ones.
### 7
With your lofty beams, o Agni—with your flaming flame, o god, when kindled at Bharadvāja’s, o youngest one, richly light up for us, o  flaming one,
brilliantly light up, o pure one.
### 8
You are houselord of all the clans stemming from Manu, o Agni. With your hundred strongholds, o youngest one, protect your kindler  from narrow straits for a hundred winters,
and protect those who give to your praisers.
### 9
You good one, conspicuous by your help, impel bounties to us. Of this wealth here you are the charioteer, Agni. Find a ford for our  progeny.
### 10
Deliver our progeny and posterity to the further shore, with deliverers  who are undeceivable and not absent-minded.
O Agni, keep godly rages away from us and ungodly tangles.
### 11
Comrades, drive near a juice-yielding milk-cow with your newer speech. Send one who doesn’t kick—
### 12
Who will milk out undying fame for the self-radiant troop of Maruts, who is in the grace of the precipitous Maruts, who goes her own way  with benevolent thoughts.
### 13
For Bharadvāja, once again, milk both a milk-cow yielding all milk and refreshment yielding all nourishment.
### 14
Strong-willed like Indra, master of artifice like Varuṇa,
gladdening and yielding lush nourishment like Aryaman, just like  Viṣṇu—that one will I praise for you, to mark him out—
### 15
Turbulent like the troop of Maruts, powerfully noisy, without  assailant—Pūṣan (I praise), so that hundreds,
thousands (of goods) he will heap together from the settled domains.  He will make the hidden goods visible; he will make goods easy for  us to find.
### 16
Run up to me, Pūṣan. I will announce close to your ear, o glowing one: “Evil are the hostilities of the stranger.
### 17
“Don’t tear out the Kākambīra tree—pursue the taunts and make them  disappear! And certainly don’t (tear off the wheel) of the sun: for thus never could  you give pursuit to the one who ‘puts the necks’ (of the horses to the  chariot-pole?).
### 18
“Let (us) have a partnership that keeps the wolf away, with you who are  like a leather bag—
an unsplit one that holds curds, a well-filled one that holds curds.”
### 19
For you are beyond mortals and equal with the gods in your splendor. Keep an eye on us in our battles, Pūsan. Help us now, just as before.
### 20
O you shakers, let (us) have the valuable guidance of a valuable one and  let there be the liberal spirit
either of a god or of a mortal who has sacrificed, o Maruts who receive  the forefront of the sacrifice.
### 21
He whose acclaim goes around heaven even in a single day, like the  god Sun,
the Maruts assume his vibrant power, his sacrificial name—his
Vr̥tra-smashing power, his preeminent Vr̥tra-smashing power.
### 22
Only once was Heaven born; only once was Earth born.
Only once was the milk of Pr̥śni milked. Another (of the Maruts) is not  born after this.

49 (490) All Gods
R̥jiśvan Bhāradvāja
15 verses: triṣṭubh, except śakvarī 15
A hymn of straightforward structure, typical of many All God hymns: each verse  praises a single god (or divine entity, like the pair Night and Dawn [vs. 3] or the  group of Maruts [vs.  11]). Most verses name the god in question, though the  name can be postponed till late in the verse, as in verse 2 dedicated to Agni or  verse 8 to Pūṣan, whose name is the last word in the verse. Two do not name the  god at all: verse 3 to Night and Dawn and verse 12 to Indra. The riddling tech
nique of postponing or omitting the name of an entity defined by the verse is of  course common in R̥gvedic rhetoric, and its use in All God catalogues is especially  appropriate.
There is no obvious ritual or other significance to the order of gods in this hymn,  though many of the parties to the Morning Pressing occur early in the hymn: Agni  (vs. 2), Night and Dawn (vs. 3), Vāyu (vs. 4), Aśvins (vs. 5). On the other hand, the  verse dedicated to Indra (12), a regular participant in the dawn ritual, is late in the  hymn, though he is obliquely present, with the Maruts, in 6cd. No god receives  more than a single verse, though, as just mentioned, Indra and the Maruts have a  presence in the Parjanya and Vāta [=Thunder and Wind] verse (6), as Agni does
842 VI.49
in the Mitra and Varuṇa verse (1) and in the Tvaṣṭar verse (9). The reference shifts  between the 3rd and 2nd person, with the former predominating. The final verse of  the hymn, in a slightly different meter (triṣṭubh but with an extra pāda), mentions  no specific gods, but asks all of them for benefits.
### 1
I will praise the people of good commandment with newer hymns, will  praise Mitra and Varuṇa the gracious.
Let them come hither; let them listen here—those of good dominion,  Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni.
### 2
The one to be reverently invoked at the ceremonies of every clan, of  undistracted resolve, the spoked wheel of the two youthful ones
[=Heaven and Earth],
the child of Heaven, the son of strength—Agni—the ruddy beacon of  the sacrifice (I invoke) to perform sacrifice.
### 3
The two daughters of the ruddy one, differing in form: the one is  ornamented with stars, the other is the sun’s.
The two pure ones, transiting alternately, wandering apart—being
hymned they both approach the prayerful thought once it is heard.
### 4
A lofty inspired thought (goes) forth to Vāyu, who, possessing lofty  wealth and all valuables, fills the chariot.
Having a brilliant course, master of teams, as poet you seek to reach the  poet, you who are worshiped at the forefront of the sacrifice.
### 5
That seems to me a wonder—the chariot of the Aśvins, radiant, yoked  with mind,
by which you two, Nāsatyas, superior men, drive your circuit, for our  descendants and ourselves to prosper.
### 6
Parjanya [/Thunder] and Vāta [/Wind], you two bulls of the earth,  quicken the watery outpourings (for him [=human poet])
through whose hymns—you poets who really hear [=Maruts] and you  mounter of the moving world [=Indra]—you made the moving world  your own.
### 7
The daughter of Pavīru, the maiden with a brilliant lifespan, Sarasvatī,  whose husband is a hero, will confer poetic insight.
Together with the (divine) ladies she will hold out to the singer unbroken  shelter, protection difficult to assail.
### 8
I will direct my eloquence to the complete protector of every path.  Prompted by desire, he has attained the chant.
He will bestow on us proliferating riches tipped with gold; he will cause  every visionary thought to reach its goal—Pūṣan.
### 9
To him who receives the first portion, the glorious conferrer of vigor, the  skillful god with lovely palms and lovely hands
who deserves the sacrifice of the dwelling places—to Tvaṣṭar easy to  invoke will far-radiant Agni, the Hotar, sacrifice. 10. The father of creation: with these hymns strengthen Rudra by day,  Rudra by night;
the lofty, high, ageless, very gracious one would we invoke separately,  roused by the poet.
### 11
You youths, poets deserving the sacrifice, you Maruts—come hither in  response to the singer’s longing for space,
for you in your strength quicken even (a place) without brightness,
approaching in just the same way as to Aṅgiras, you superior men.
### 12
Forth to the hero, forth to the powerful, precipitous one will I drive  (praise?), as a guardian of livestock drives his flocks home.
He will make the inspired words of the speaker touch the body of him  who is famed, as one makes the firmament touched by stars.
### 13
He who measured out the earthly realms three times exactly, for Manu,  who was hard-pressed—Viṣṇu—
in this shelter of yours (still) being offered might we rejoice with wealth,  with life and lineage.
### 14
Let Ahi Budhnya take delight in this (praise?) of ours, along with the  waters and the chants; in this let the Mountain, in this let Savitar
take delight;
let the Gift-Escorts, let Fortune, let Plenitude quicken this along with  the plants, for wealth.
### 15
Now to us give wealth in chariots, filling the settled domains, consisting  of many heroes, the herdsmen of great truth;
give ageless peaceful dwelling (and that) with which we will trample  upon the (other) peoples, the godless contenders,
with which we will take on the godless clans.

R̥jiśvan Bhāradvāja
15 verses: triṣṭubh
Unlike the last hymn, with its tidy organization allotting one verse per god, this  All God hymn casts a wider and more inclusive net with multiple gods some times mixed in a single verse, some gods given more than one verse (Maruts, vss.  4–5), and marginally divinized figures, like the Waters (vs. 7), also addressed.  The first verse establishes this messy inclusiveness, calling on Aditi, the three  principal Ādityas (Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman), Agni, Savitar, Bhaga, and the  “rescuer gods,” who may, but need not be, the Maruts. The hymn also has a  more direct and intimate feel than VI.49: although both hymns mix 2nd-person  and 3rd-person reference to the gods, in VI.50 the 2nd person predominates, in  contrast to VI.49, and the 2nd-person invocations in VI.50 more often contain844 VI.50
imperatives and requests in the optative, in contrast to the generally descriptive  clauses of VI.49.
Another noteworthy feature is the relative prominence of female divinities.  Again, the first verse sets the scene by placing Aditi first. Besides Earth, in the  pair Heaven and Earth (vs. 3), we find Rodasī (vs. 5), the motherly Waters (vs. 7),  Sarasvatī (vs. 12), the Wives of the Gods, associated with Tvaṣṭar (vs. 13), and  Earth again (vss. 13–14). The divine ladies end the hymn (vs. 15).
### 1
I call upon goddess Aditi for you with reverences, on Varuṇa, Mitra,  Agni, for mercy,
on Aryaman the very well-disposed, who gives without being begged, on  the rescuer gods, on Savitar and Bhaga.
### 2
O very great Sun, pursue the gods of good light whose father is skill, in  (witness to our) blamelessness—
they who have two births, the trusty ones who serve the truth, sunlit,  worthy of worship, having Agni as their tongue.
### 3
And, Heaven and Earth, you two very gracious world-halves—you will  make broad, lofty dominion as shelter
great(ly), so that there will be a faultless wide realm for our peaceful  dwelling, you two Holy Places.
### 4
Let the sons of Rudra incline themselves to us here, the unassailable  good ones invoked today,
since we, placed in petty or in great distress, have called upon the
Maruts, the gods—
### 5
The ones to whom the goddess Rodasī is joined, on whom Pūṣan attends,  sharing the sacrifice by halves.
O Maruts, when, on having heard our call, you make your drive, the  worlds tremble at your agitated course.
### 6
Chant to this hero who has a yearning for songs—to Indra with a new  sacred formulation, o singer.
He will hear the call. While being praised and being greatly hymned, he  will give rewards.
### 7
O Waters belonging to Manu, establish unimpaired succor as luck and  lifetime for our offspring and descendants.
For you are the most motherly healers, the begetters of everything still  and moving.
### 8
God Savitar, who gives protection, should come hither to us—the  golden-palmed one deserving the sacrifice,
who, rich in gifts, like the face of Dawn discloses valuables to the pious. 9. And you, Son of Strength—you should turn the gods hither to us today  to this ceremony here.
Might I be always within (the sphere of) your giving; by your help might  I possess good heroes, Agni. 10. And you Nāsatyas should come here to my summons with your  insightful thoughts—you certainly are inspired poets.
(As you did) Atri from great darkness, release (me)—triumph, men!— from difficulty at close quarters.
### 11
Become for us givers of wealth that is brilliant, rich in prizes, in men, in  much livestock.
Showing favor, o gods—the heavenly, earthly, cow-born, and watery  ones—be merciful.
### 12
Let those who grant rewards be merciful to us in concord—Rudra and  Sarasvatī, Viṣṇu, Vāyu,
the Master of the R̥bhus, Vāja, the divine Distributor. Let Parjanya  [/Thunder] and Vāta [/Wind] swell refreshments for us.
### 13
And this god Savitar and Bhaga and the Child of the Waters—let (each)  help us, supplying gifts,
and Tvaṣṭar jointly with the divine ones, the Wives, Heaven with the  gods, Earth with the seas.
### 14
And let Ahi Budhnya hear us and Aja Ekapad, Earth, Sea,
and all the gods, strong through truth, when they are invoked and
praised. Let the solemn utterances, pronounced by poets, help (us).
### 15
In just this way the Bharadvājas, the descendants of me, this Mamata,  chant with their insightful thoughts, with their chants.
The (divine) ladies, the unassailable good ones who are offered to—all  of you be praised, you who deserve the sacrifice.

R̥jiśvan Bhāradvāja
16 verses: triṣṭubh 1–12, uṣṇih 13–15, anuṣṭubh 16
This sixteen-verse hymn falls metrically into three quite unequal portions: 1–12,  13–15, and 16. On the basis of both structure and content, it appears that these  were originally at least two separate hymns. Verses 1–12 are unitary in tone, and  the central, responsive verses 6–7 can be interpreted as an omphalos, supported  by various lexical rings. (Oldenberg [1888: 199–200], however, divides these twelve  verses into four tr̥ca hymns.)
The hymn so defined differs markedly from the last two All God hymns (VI.49– 50), which catalogue a series of gods and their attributes in an unordered list. This  hymn, in contrast, is highly reminiscent of the Mitra, Varuṇa, and Sūrya hymns in  Maṇḍala VII (VII.60–63), in which the Sun surveys the human world and bears wit ness to Mitra and Varuṇa about the innocence and guilt of men. Like those hymns,  this begins with the rising of the sun (vss. 1–2); it then turns to praise of the Ādityas.  The emphasis is on their truth and lack of deceit—Ādityan preoccupations.
846 VI.51
The omphalos verses (6–7), marked by initial repeated mā́ “don’t!,” beg the gods  not to subject us to undeserved punishment, thus implicitly claiming our innocence,  which should be visible to the all-seeing Sun (though the final pāda of the follow ing vs. 8 seems to allow the possibility of a modicum of guilt). The remaining five  verses (8–12) return to the theme of the truthful gods, with somewhat more insis tent prayers for grace and help. Toward the end, in verse 11, a larger group of gods  is named: invocations of additional gods at the end of a hymn are very common.  The last verse (12), naming the priestly family and summarizing the content and  intent of the hymn that precedes it, is a typical final verse.
The remaining verses (13–16) may have been appended to this hymn because they  chiefly concern various malefactors whom we wish to banish or destroy, including  the cheat (ripú, vs. 13) and the (clearly human) “wolf” (vŕ̥ka, vs. 14), both of which  were also mentioned as dangers in the omphalos verses (“cheat” vs. 7, “wolf” vs. 6).
### 1
Up goes this great eye of Mitra and of Varuṇa—dear and undeceivable. The blazing, sightly face of truth has flashed forth on its rising like the  bright ornament of heaven.
### 2
The inspired poet who knows their three divisions and the breeds of the  gods far away and here,
who sees the straight and the crooked among mortals, the Sun looks  upon the ways of the stranger.
### 3
I will praise you, the great herdsmen of truth: Aditi, Mitra, Varuṇa, the  well-born ones.
Aryaman, Bhaga, those of undeceivable inspired thoughts, the pure  companions, do I call here.
### 4
Those who care for the stranger, the lords of settlements, undeceivable,  the great kings, givers of good dwelling,
the youths of good rule ruling over Heaven, the superior men—the
Ādityas I beseech and Aditi, in quest of friendship.
### 5
O Father Heaven, Mother Earth lacking the lie, Brother Agni, good  ones—have mercy on us.
All you Ādityas and Aditi jointly—spread out ample shelter for us.
### 6
Don’t make us subject to the wolf, to the she-wolf, to any at all who  wishes us ill, o you who deserve the sacrifice,
for you are the charioteers of our bodies and you have become (the
charioteers) of (our?) skillful speech.
### 7
Don’t let us pay for the offense done to you by another; don’t let us do  that which you avenge, o good ones,
for you rule over all, All Gods. Let the cheat harm his own body.
### 8
Reverence is powerful. I seek to attract reverence here. Reverence  upholds heaven and earth.
Reverence to the gods; reverence is master of them. With reverence
I seek to redeem even an offense committed. 9. You charioteers of truth who possess refined skill, settled in the  dwelling places of truth, undeceivable,
all you great superior men of broad gaze do I bend here with
reverences, o you who deserve the sacrifice.
### 10
For they possess the best luster and they lead us across all difficulties— those of good rule, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, whose inspired thoughts are  truth, who are in reality rulers of speech.
### 11
They strengthen our earthly realm—Indra, Earth, Pūṣan, Bhaga, Aditi,  the Five Peoples.
Affording good shelter, good help, good guidance, let them be good  herdsmen for us, offering us good protection.
### 12
To attain the one whose seat is in heaven, o gods, the Hotar of the  Bhāradvājas now begs for favor.
Sacrificing with the ritual meals set here, desiring goods, he has extolled  the breeds of the gods.
### 13
Away with this crooked, cheating, ill-intentioned thief, o Agni.
Make an easy passage for him far, far away, o lord of settlements.
### 14
Surely our pressing stones have bellowed for your
companionship, Soma.
Smash down the rapacious niggard. For he is a wolf!
### 15
Because you of good drops, with Indra preeminent, are heaven-bound, make good passage for us on the road. (Be) herdsmen at home.
### 16
We have gone on the faultless path leading to well-being,
on which one avoids all hatreds and finds goods.

R̥jiśvan Bhāradvāja
17 verses: triṣṭubh 1–6, gāyatrī 7–12, triṣṭubh 13, jagatī 14, triṣṭubh 15–17, generally  arranged in trcas ̥
This final, seventeen-verse hymn of the short All God cycle of Maṇḍala VI is met rically and thematically non-unified, and probably consists of originally separate  pieces later joined together. (So also Oldenberg 1888:  199–200.) The first twelve  verses divide into four tr̥cas, the first two in one meter, the second two in another.  The first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) inveighs against a rival sacrificer and calls on the Maruts  and Soma to destroy him, in lively and imaginative terms. In style, though not in  meter, it more closely resembles verses 13–15 of the preceding hymn VI.51 than  what follows. The second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) is more staid, but notable for calling on not  only the standard deities but also on natural phenomena for aid. The remainder of  the hymn is generic and somewhat repetitive, urging the gods in general to hear our  calls and partake of our sacrifice. Relatively few gods are mentioned by name; there
848 VI.52
is instead an effort to include all the gods, whatever their current or original loca tion (see esp. vss. 13, 15). After the first two tr̥cas, the language is for the most part  easy and without much character.
### 1
Not by Heaven nor by Earth do I concede this, not by my sacrifice and  not by these ritual labors.
Let the well-founded mountains crush him. Let the sacrificer of an
excessive sacrifice be bent double.
### 2
Whoever disdains us, Maruts, or will scorn our sacred formulation as it  is being performed,
let his twisted (ways) be twisting, scorching (flames) for him. Let
Heaven blaze at him who hates the formulation.
### 3
Do they not (call) you, o Soma, the herdsman of the sacred
formulation? Do they not call you our protector from taunt?
Do you not see us being scorned? Hurl your scorching lance at the
hater of the formulation!
### 4
Let the dawns help me as they are being born; let the rivers help me as  they are swelling.
Let the steadfast mountains help me; let the forefathers help me at the  invocation of the gods.
### 5
Might we always be of good mind; might we look now upon the sun as  it rises:
so shall he arrange it—he who is lauded over the gods as goods-lord of  goods, as the most welcome arrival because of his help.
### 6
Indra the most welcome arrival in the nearest nearness because of his  help; Sarasvatī swelling with the (other) rivers;
Parjanya—joy itself for us with his plants; Agni good to proclaim, good  to call on, like a father.
### 7
All you gods, come here. Hear this call of mine.
Sit down here on this ritual grass.
### 8
The one who attends to you with a ghee-backed oblation, o gods— you all come close to him.
### 9
Let the sons of the immortal one listen to our hymns.
Let them be very merciful to us.
### 10
Let all the gods, strong through truth, hearing the calls in their turns, enjoy the associated milk.
### 11
Let Indra along with his Marut-flock, let Mitra and Aryaman along  with Tvaṣṭar,
enjoy the praise song and these oblations of ours.
### 12
O Agni, Hotar, perform this ceremony as sacrifice for us according to  its patterns,
as one who attends to the divine folk. 13. All you gods, hear this call of mine—you who are in the midspace or  you who are in heaven,
you who have Agni as your tongue or you who are the means of
sacrifice. Having sat on this ritual grass here, bring yourselves to
exhilaration.
### 14
Let all the gods deserving the sacrifice hear me; let both world-halves  and the Child of the Waters hear my thought.
Let me not speak speeches to you that can be disregarded. Might we, in  nearest contact with you, reach exhilaration just on your favors.
### 15
Whichever great ones, snake-sly, were born on the earth or in the seat of  heaven or of the waters,
let those gods seek a wide place for us to prosper day and night for our  whole lifetime.
### 16
O Agni and Parjanya, help my insightful thought, our lovely praise at  this call here, you who are easy to call.
The one begets the refreshing drink, the other the embryo. Confer
refreshments accompanied by offspring on us.
### 17
When the ritual grass has been strewn, when the fire is being kindled,  I seek to entice (them) here with a hymn, with great reverence.
At this rite of ours here today, all you gods deserving the sacrifice,
bring yourselves to exhilaration on the oblation.

10 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 8
Pūṣan is a favorite minor god of the Bharadvājas: this short Pūṣan sequence (VI.53– 58) is the only series of hymns dedicated to Pūṣan in the R̥gveda. This particular  hymn begins with gentle and positive requests of the god (vss. 1–2), but quickly  becomes more bloodthirsty, seeking Pūṣan’s punishment against stingy patrons. The  instruments of punishment are the homely tools of Pūṣan, his awl (vss. 5–8) and goad  (vs. 9). Despite the apparent viciousness of the actions urged on Pūṣan, the short  lines, repeated phrases, colloquial expressions, and phonetic figures (what is trans
lated anachronistically as “shred them, make them shrapnel” in vss. 7–8 is in Sanskrit  the delightful ā́ rikha kikirā́ kr̥ṇu) give a light texture and playful feeling to the hymn.
### 1
We have yoked you, o lord of the path—like a chariot for
prize-winning—
for poetic vision, o Pūṣan.
### 2
Lead us toward goods stemming from men, toward a hero who has  offered a ritual gift,
toward a houselord of value.
850 VI.54
### 3
Even one who doesn’t want to give, o glowing Pūṣan—impel him  to give.
Soften up the mind even of the niggard.
### 4
Clear out the paths for prize-winning; smash away the negligent. Let our poetic visions reach their goal, o strong one.
### 5
Bore around the hearts of the niggards with an awl, you poet.
And make them subject to us.
### 6
Thrust through (them) with an awl, Pūṣan. Seek what is dear to the  heart of the niggard.
And make him subject to us.
### 7
Shred them, make them shrapnel—the hearts of the niggards, you poet. And make them subject to us.
### 8
The awl that you carry, which impels the sacred formulation, o
glowing Pūṣan,
with it shred the heart of each one, make it shrapnel.
### 9
Your goad with its cow [=leather] “headband” [=strap] that sends the  livestock to their goal, glowing one,
we implore the favor of this (goad) of yours.

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: gāyatrī
This little hymn is noteworthy for its structure, with a lexical chain knitting the  verses together: each verse, except the last (6), contains at least one word or phrase  from the preceding verse. The last verse does contain a phonological echo of the  preceding one: “brother” in verse 5 (bhrā́tā) is echoed by the last word of verse 6  (“bearing” bíbhrataḥ).
It is also noteworthy for the startling, but oddly offhand and uncensorious, allu sion to incest in verses 4–5, where Pūṣan is identified as the lover of his sister and  the wooer of his mother. This follows on three verses (1–3) seeking Pūṣan as chari oteer and giver of wealth, and after the incest verses the poet returns to the chariot  motif to end the hymn (vs. 6). What the poet is alluding to is Pūṣan’s alleged mar riage to Sūryā, Daughter of the Sun, glancingly mentioned in nearby VI.58.4 as  well as in X.26.6.
### 1
Come here! Let us two, o child of release, glowing one, together
accompany each other.
Become the charioteer of truth for us.
### 2
The best charioteer, with braided hair, holding sway over great bounty, the companion of wealth we beseech for wealth.
### 3
You are a stream of wealth, glowing one, a heap of goods, you with goats  as horses,
the companion of every visionary.
### 4
Pūṣan who has goats for horses let us now approach with praise—the  prizewinner,
who is said to be the lover of his sister.
### 5
The wooer of his mother I have spoken to: let the lover of his sister  hear us,
brother of Indra, companion to me.

Let the trusty [?] goats draw Pūṣan on his chariot, him who brings (all) to  readiness *with his sharp (goad),

56 (497) Pūsaṇ
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 6
This hymn has several elements familiar from the previous Pūṣan hymns: he is “the  best charioteer” (vs. 2, cf. VI.55.2); he helps the thoughts of poets reach their goal  (vs. 4, cf. VI.53.4); he helps us win the prize of cattle (vs. 5, cf. VI.53.4, 10).
There are several novelties in the hymn as well. The hymn begins by naming  Pūṣan as “porridge-eater” in an enigmatic construction. Porridge is indeed well  known from elsewhere as Pūṣan’s characteristic food (see, e.g., VI.57.2 in the next  hymn), but is the last phrase of verse 1 an ominous warning, as some have taken it  (Pūṣan will be insulted), or a positive indication of Pūṣan’s eagerness to respond, as  others have (he doesn’t need to be invited twice, when porridge is mentioned)? We  think that it is neither one; rather, “porridge eater” is such a unique designation for  Pūṣan that a poet need provide no further clues to identify him.
In verse 2 Indra appears as Pūṣan’s companion; this partnership is further devel oped in the next hymn, VI.57. The third verse is the most puzzling of the hymn.  Nothing further is known about this story—if it is a story—of Pūṣan, the Sun’s char iot wheel, and the gray cow, though we suspect that it is connected with the extremely  puzzling nearby verse VI.48.17, also of Pūṣan. If so, this associates Pūṣan with Indra  in the tearing off of the wheel of the Sun’s chariot, a myth found in scattered pieces  elsewhere. The “gray cow” may also be a naturalistic reference to a cloudy dawn  twilight, with the sun rising through it. Whatever lies behind it, the image is striking.
### 1
Whoever will designate him, Pūṣan, as “porridge-eater,”
by him the god (need) not be designated (again).
### 2
And he is the best charioteer. With him as partner and yokemate, the  lord of settlements,
Indra, keeps smashing obstacles.
### 3
And yonder golden wheel of the Sun
he set down in the “gray cow”—he the best charioteer.
### 4
What today we will say to you, much praised wondrous counselor, make that thought of ours reach its goal.
### 5
And make this cow-seeking troop of ours reach its goal for winning. From afar, Pūṣan, you are famed.
### 6
We beg of you well-being that keeps evil afar and goods nearby,
for wholeness today and for wholeness tomorrow.

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: gāyatrī
Indra and Pūṣan are invoked together at the very beginning of this hymn, in a  construction (the dual dvandva) that implies habitual intimacy. In the next two  verses (2–3) their contrastive attributes are used as definitional descriptors; in verse  2 Indra is the first identified, while in verse 3 the order is the opposite. The end of  verse 3 and verse 4 seem to background Pūṣan while foregrounding Indra’s great  deeds, but the final two verses (5–6) return them to equality, and indeed in both  verses Pūṣan is mentioned first, with Indra almost an afterthought. The implied  equipoise between the two gods would of course be amusing to a Vedic audience,  given the sharp distinction between their importance in the pantheon.
In the translation we have retained as much as possible the order of the ele ments, even though this violates normal English patterns, because the balance  between the two gods and their qualities is conveyed by their careful stationing in  the verse.
### 1
Indra and Pūṣan would we—for partnership, for well-being—
call upon—for prize-winning.
### 2
Soma has the one sat down to, to drink it pressed in the two cups. Porridge does the other one desire.
### 3
Goats are the draft-animals for the one; two fallow bay horses, fully  equipped, are for the other;
along with those two (horses) he keeps smashing obstacles.
### 4
When Indra the most bullish led the streams, the great waters,
then Pūṣan came along.
### 5
The benevolence of Pūṣan—like the branch of a tree—
and that of Indra we seize hold of.

We ease up on Pūṣan—like a charioteer the reins—
and Indra, for great well-being.

This last hymn in the Pūṣan cycle in Maṇḍala VI is the only one in trimeter meter,  rather than the less formal dimeter. It pictures Pūṣan in a more cosmic context than  the previous hymns and ascribes rather more powers to him. The final verse (4),  probably with verse 3, refers to the apparent marriage of Pūṣan to Sūryā, daughter  of the Sun, a tale alluded to in passing earlier in this cycle.854 VI.59

Having goats as his horses, protecting livestock, granting a house full of  prizes, quickening poetic vision, fitted into all creation,

59 (500) Indra and Agni
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
10 verses: brhat ̥ ī 1–6, anuṣṭubh 7–10
As has been discussed elsewhere, despite the major roles each of these gods plays  in the R̥gveda, Indra and Agni have little in common ritually or mythologically.  Nonetheless, eleven hymns are dedicated jointly to them. In this particular hymn,  the pairing is insisted upon: every verse has a form of the dual dvandva compound  “Indra-Agni.” Moreover, their kinship and joint birth is the subject of the first two  verses, which, as many scholars have claimed, may be conceptually connected to the  murky hymn X.124, possibly concerning the defeat of the Asuras (the Fathers of vs.  1 in this hymn?) by the Devas or gods. Elsewhere in the R̥gveda there is no evidence  for a family connection between Indra and Agni.
As in some other Indra-Agni hymns, Agni is assimilated to Indra at least in the  early verses, since Indra has the more dynamic mythology. The standard promise to  Indra to “proclaim (his) manly deeds” is made to Indra and Agni in verse 1; soma  is offered to them in verses 1, 3 and 4, though it is really Indra’s drink; and they  are both said to possess the mace, Indra’s weapon, in verse 3. The balance changes  somewhat in verses 5–6. The two gods are separated and, though not named, are  identified by their characteristics. The second hemistich of 5 refers to Agni alone,  and in verse 6, after a reference to Dawn and her cows, probably alluding to the  Morning Pressing where Agni is kindled and Indra appears, the second half-verse  contrasts Agni (pāda c) and Indra (pāda d). This brings to an end the first division of the hymn as defined metrically, and  this portion forms a satisfactory unit celebrating the gods and offering them praise  and soma. The last four verses, also metrically unified, make the singer’s requests,  for aid against enemies (vss. 7–8) and for wealth (vs. 9), and again invite them with  praise and soma (vs. 10). Despite the metrical division, which corresponds to a  functional and thematic difference, there is no reason to consider this a composite  hymn, pace Oldenberg (1888: 200). It conforms to a common pattern: praise and  then requests, and the shorter dimeter meter of the last four verses is appropriate  to the specific requests, in contrast to the rhetorically more formal praise section in  the lyric br̥hatī.
### 1
I shall now proclaim, when (soma drinks) have been pressed for you, the  manly deeds that you two have done.
Slain are your fathers whose rivals were the gods, but, o Indra and Agni,  you are (still) alive.
### 2
Yes indeed! It is just so: your greatness is most to be marveled at, Indra  and Agni.
Your begetter was the same: you two are brothers, twins (though) with  one mother here, one there.
### 3
The two who are accustomed to the pressed (soma), like a pair of teamed  horses to their fodder,
Indra and Agni, both possessing the mace, the two gods, we call here  with their aid.
### 4
Indra and Agni, whoever will praise you, strong through truth, at these  pressings—
you two will never snap at one who speaks (such) a pleasurable speech,  you gods who receive substantial oblations.
### 5
O gods Indra and Agni, what mortal shall perceive this one of you two? The single one, (though) having yoked his horses facing in all directions,  goes speeding on the same chariot.
### 6
Indra and Agni, this footless one here [=Dawn] has gone in front of the  footed ones [=cows?].
While (this one [=Agni],) having left his head behind, constantly
chattering with his tongue, goes wandering, (this one [=Indra?]) has  trodden down thirty with his foot.
### 7
Indra and Agni, since gallant men are drawing their bows in their arms, do not shun us in this (contest) for great stakes, in our quests for cattle. 8. Indra and Agni, the evil hostilities of the stranger scorch me.
Make hatreds stay far away from here; keep (him) away from the sun. 9. Indra and Agni, in you are heavenly and earthly goods.
Extend to us here wealth that brings lifelong prosperity.

Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
15 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, gāyatrī 4–12, triṣṭubh 13, brhat ̥ ī 14, anuṣṭubh 15, arranged  in trcas ̥
This Indra-Agni hymn, organized into tr̥cas, begins with three verses in trimeter  meter notable for the tendency to address Indra and Agni separately, each in the  vocative singular, though they receive joint epithets, are referred to by shared pro nouns, and are generally, but not exclusively (see vs. 2d), the subjects of dual verbs.  Our translation reflects this peculiar disjunction of vocatives. This separate address  is not characteristic of the rest of the hymn, where the dual dvandva compound  “Indra-Agni” (or, once, a conjoined phrase “Indra and Agni,” vs. 12) is found in  nine of the remaining twelve verses, and the last tr̥ca begins with a verse (13) con
taining four occurrences of the explicit adjective “(you) both” (ubhā́). The content of the praise is generic, with a tendency toward Indraic deeds and  qualities (see esp. vss. 3, 6). The second-to-last tr̥ca treats the two gods separately,  without naming them: Agni in verse 10, Indra in verse 11, and a return to joint ref erence in verse 12. The final triplet (vss. 13–15) is in three different meters, and it has  been suggested that it did not originally belong to the rest of the hymn. However,  notice that the return to longer lines matches the meter of the first tr̥ca, and there  are also verbal responsions with the first three verses, so that a ring-compositional  structure is sketched. The strong emphasis on the unified front presented by the two  gods in verses 13–15 contrasts implicitly with the separate address in the first tr̥ca,  and may hint that our own hymn has brought about the close cooperation between  the two gods that will benefit us.

61 (502) Sarasvatı̄
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
14 verses: jagatī 1–3, gāyatrī 4–12, jagatī 13, triṣṭubh 14, organized in tr̥cas
This hymn has a metrical structure similar to the preceding one, VI.60: it is orga nized in tr̥cas, with the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) in a trimeter meter, the next three tr̥cas in
858 VI.61
dimeter (4–12), a return to the original meter in verse 13, and, here, a final verse (14)  in yet a different meter. The complexity of the meter corresponds roughly with the  density of the thought: the first tr̥ca is rich in imagery and particularities; the follow ing three tr̥cas are less adorned and more generic, though Sarasvatī’s riverine nature  is clear, especially in the second of these tr̥cas, verses 7–9. The hymn ends with a final
statement of her superiority (vs. 13) and a plea for her aid and sustenance (vs. 14). The sheer power of the river and the potential menace of her relentless flow are  nicely conveyed, especially in the first tr̥ca, where she punishes a series of human  foes and even destroys the mountains while rewarding her praisers. In parts of the  hymn, these rewards are clearly related to her identity as river—the streambeds in  verse 3, the milk we pray for in verse 14—but in others the connection is not clear,  especially the gift to Vadhryaśva of (apparently) a son Divodāsa, which opens the  hymns. The hostile Br̥saya of verse 3 is also unclear: the name occurs only once  elsewhere in the R̥gveda (I.93.4) in similar context.
### 1
She gave to the pious Vadhryaśva tempestuous Divodāsa who shakes  the debtor,
she who has wrenched away the provender from one niggard after
another. These are your powerful gifts, o Sarasvatī.
### 2
She, like a root-grubbing (boar) with her snortings, broke the back of  the mountains with her powerful waves.
Sarasvatī, who smashes the foreigners, we would entice here for help  with well-plaited (hymns), with visionary thoughts.
### 3
Sarasvatī, tear down the scorners of the gods, the offspring of every  tricky Br̥saya.
And (while) you found streambeds for the settlements, you flowed
poison for them, o you rich in prize mares.
### 4
Let goddess Sarasvatī, rich in prize mares, with her prizes
help us—the helper of visionary thoughts.
### 5
Whoever makes appeal to you, goddess Sarasvatī, when the stake is set, as if to Indra at the overcoming of Vr̥tra,
### 6
Aid (him), goddess Sarasvatī, at the prize (contests), you prizewinner. Channel gain to us, like Pūṣan.
### 7
And this Sarasvatī, having a golden course, fearsome,
obstacle-smashing, wants our good praise—
### 8
Whose boundless, unswerving, turbulent, roving flood,
her onslaught, proceeds ever roaring.
### 9
Beyond all hatreds, beyond her other sisters [=rivers] has the
truthful one
extended us, like the sun the days.
### 10
And she, dear(est) among the dear (rivers), having seven sisters, very  delightful—
Sarasvatī is (ever) worthy of our praise. 11. Having filled the earthly (places), the broad realm, the midspace, let Sarasvatī protect (us) from scorn.
### 12
Having three seats and seven parts, strengthening the five peoples, at every prize contest she is worthy to be invoked.
### 13
The one who by her greatness shines ever more brightly among the  great (rivers), (beyond) the others by her brilliance, the busiest of
the busy,
like a chariot lofty and fashioned for wide ranging, she is to be praised  by (every) observant one—Sarasvatī.
### 14
O Sarasvatī, lead us to a better state. Do not spring away with your  milk; do not come up short for us.
Take delight in our partnerships and communities. Let us not go from  you to alien dwelling places.

62 (503) Aśvins
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The first five verses of this hymn cover the familiar ground of Aśvin hymns—the  poet’s eager invitation to the two gods to drive to our sacrifice. Though the theme  and sentiments are familiar, there are a number of nice touches—the enjambment  across verse boundaries (1/2a; 2bcd/3a, at least in our opinion) and the play on the  concepts of newer and older in verses 4–5. This section ends (5d) with the phrase,  modifying the Aśvins, “providing bright gifts to the singer” (gr̥ṇaté citrárātī).
The following two verses (6–7) touch on several of the Aśvins’ famous deeds,  especially the rescue of Bhujyu from the sea (vs. 6), but the two verses after that  (8–9) take a detour, addressing other gods and urging them to take violent action  against various enemies. The poet seems so agitated that he loses his grip on gram
mar:  verse 9, concerning Mitra and Varuṇa, is syntactically fragmented, shift ing without warning or grammatical agreement between dual and singular and  between 3rd and 2nd person. (We have not been able to render the full effect in  English.)
Though verse 10 returns us to the Aśvins’ journey and to a more tranquil gram matical level, it too enlists the Aśvins to attack and also suggests that their journey  to us was prompted by the failure of other men. The final verse gives no hint of  the agitation in the immediately preceding verses and ends with the same phrase as  verse 5, thus implicitly indicating the bipartite structure of the hymn.
### 1
I shall praise the two outstanding men of this heaven; I call upon the  Aśvins, singing [/awakening] with my chants—
they who, at the breaking of the ruddy dawn, in a single day seek to  encompass the ends of the earth and its broad expanses,
860 VI.62
### 2
While striding to the sacrifice with their gleaming (horses). (The horses)  have shone the radiant beam of their chariot through the dusky  spaces.
Measuring the many immeasurable expanses, you two drive over the  waters, wastelands, and fields,
### 3
When (you drive) this circuit without slackening, o powerful ones. Over  and over you have conveyed insights that are right to the point, with  your horses
swift as thought and vigorous, in order to circumscribe the wayward  course of the pious mortal.
### 4
The two attend upon the thoughts of (me), the newer singer, having  harnessed their team,
conveying beauty and fortifying power, refreshment and nourishment.  The age-old Hotar without deceit shall offer sacrifice to the two  youths.
### 5
The two, obliging and skillful, best endowed with many abilities—those  age-old ones do I seek to attract here with my newer speech—
those two who become most wealful for the reciter and praiser,
providing bright gifts to the singer.
### 6
You two with your birds conveyed Bhujyu, the son of Tugra, from the  waters, from the sea, through the airy realms,
through dustless treks, bending (him) away from the lap of the flood  with your winged ones.
### 7
With your victorious (chariot), you charioteers drove through the rock;  you harkened to the call of Vadhrīmatī, o bulls.
Showing favor to Śayu, you made his cow swell. Thus (did you show)  your benevolence, you stirring and bustling ones.
### 8
O world-halves, the anger of gods and among mortals that exists from  of old on earth,
direct that evil heat at the yokemate of demons, o Ādityas, Vasus, and  Rudriyas.
### 9
Which (one of) the two kings, Mitra or Varuṇa, will keep watch over the  airy realm, regulating it according to the proper sequence—
hurl your missile at the deep-embedded demonic power and also at the  deceitful speech of the Anu people.
### 10
With your wheels drawing nearer, with your heaven-bright chariot with  its superior men, do you two drive your circuit for our lineage (to  prosper),
because of the distant dereliction of a(nother) mortal. Chop off the  heads of the rapacious ones.
### 11
Drive here with your highest and midmost teams, this way with your lowest. Open the doors of the cattle pen, even though they are shut fast, you  who provide bright gifts for the singer.

63 (504) Aśvins
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except ekapadā 11
The first four verses of this hymn are divided more or less equally between the  invitation to and journey of the Aśvins to our sacrifice (vss. 1–2) and the sacrifice  itself (vss. 3–4). The next two verses (5–6) enter mythological territory: the journey  of Sūryā, daughter of the Sun, on the Aśvins’ chariot along with them. This mytho
logical journey returns us to the actual journey of today (vs. 7) and the hopes we  have of these gods when they attend our sacrifice (vs. 8). The final two verses (9–10)  are a dānastuti, naming a number of the patrons of the poet, Bharadvāja, with the  single pāda of verse 11 expressing his hope for the Aśvins’ favor to both himself and  his patrons at the place of sacrifice.
### 1
Where today did our reverential praise song, like a messenger, find these  two obliging ones, called upon by many—
(the praise song) that has (previously) turned the Nāsatyas this way? For  you two will be the dearest in his [=poet’s] thought.
### 2
Come fit for this summons of mine, so that, being hymned, you will  drink the stalk.
You drive, away from harm, around this circuit, which neither a distant  one nor one close by may traverse.
### 3
It has been made for you from the stalk; on the expanse [=ritual  ground] has been strewn the ritual grass, offering the easiest
approach.
With hands outstretched, seeking you, I have greeted (you). Approaching  you, the stones have anointed you.
### 4
The fire has stood upright for you at the ceremonies. The gift goes forth,  glowing, covered in ghee;
forth the chosen Hotar whose thought is welcomed, who has yoked the  Nāsatyas at his call.
### 5
For splendor the Daughter of the Sun mounted your chariot provided  with hundredfold help, o you who offer much enjoyment.
You became foremost then in the lineage of those worthy of the sacrifice  by your magic powers, o magicians, superior men, dancers.
### 6
Along with these splendors lovely to see you conveyed the flourishing of  Sūryā, for beauty.
The birds flew forth after you, for wonder; (their) choir reached you (so  you became) well-praised, o holy ones.
### 7
Let the birds, the horses that convey best, convey you to the pleasurable  offering, o Nāsatyas.
Your chariot swift as thought has been sent surging forth after the many  refreshments and the fortifying powers that bring refreshment.
862 VI.64
### 8
Because your giving is much, o you who give much enjoyment, swell our  cow and our refreshment (so that they) don’t dry up.
To you belong praises and the good praise-hymn and the juices that  have followed your gift, o honeyed ones.
### 9
And mine are two silver, swift (mares) of Puraya, a hundred (cows) at  (the hands of) Sumīḷha, and cooked (foods) at (the hands of) Peruka. Śāṇḍa has given gold-bedecked (horses) along with their allotted (gear).  Ten mated cows are attendant upon the high (horses).
### 10
Purupanthā has given altogether hundreds and thousands of horses for  (my) song for you;
to Bharadvāja he has given (them) for the song, o hero(es). Demonic  powers should be smashed, o you of many wondrous powers.
### 11
Might I, along with my patrons, be in your favor on the expanse  [=ritual ground].
## 64 
64 (505) Dawn
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins with reference to multiple Dawns, but soon (by the second half of  vs. 1) focuses only on a single Dawn. As so often, the hymn refers to the present and  immediate past when Dawn has just dawned. The standard tropes are present: her  wide radiance (vss. 2, 3), her ease of travel (vss. 1, 4), her feminine beauty (vs. 2),  her accompanying bovines (vss. 3, 5), and especially her connection with the priestly  gift distributed at the early-morning sacrifice and with wealth in general (vss. 1, 4,  5, 6). Although the hymn does not stand out for elaborate rhetorical tricks, it is  characterized by pleasing imagery; see especially Dawn as archer and chariot-driver  in verse 3 and the morning activities of birds and men in verse 6 (a verse found also  at I.124.12).
### 1
The shining Dawns have arisen for splendor, glistening like the waves of  the waters.
She makes all pathways, all passages easy to travel. She has appeared— the good priestly gift, the bounteous one.
### 2
Auspicious, you have become visible; you radiate widely. Your flare, your  radiant beams have flown up to heaven.
You reveal your breast as you go in beauty, goddess Dawn, shining with  all your might.
### 3
The ruddy, glistening cows convey her of good portion as she spreads  widely.
Like a champion archer his rivals, she drives away darkness; she repels it  like a quick (chariot-)driver. 4. Easy are your pathways, easy your passages (even) in the mountains.  (Even) when it is windless you cross over the waters, self-radiant one. Convey wealth here for us to prosper, high Daughter of Heaven with  your broad course.
### 5
Convey (it)—you who as the unsurpassable one with your oxen convey  the boon at your pleasure, Dawn,
you who are a goddess, o Daughter of Heaven. Become worthy to be  seen with your munificence at the early invocation!
### 6
The birds have also flown up from their dwelling, and the men who  partake of food, at your first flush.
To the one who is at home you convey much of value, o goddess Dawn,  and to the pious mortal.
## 65 
65 (506) Dawn
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: triṣṭubh
In virtual mirror-image to the previous hymn, this one begins with a single Dawn,  but turns for some verses (2–4) to the plural Dawns, before returning to a single  Dawn in the final two verses (5–6). The structure of this hymn is more cunning  than the somewhat bland VI.64, however. The poet uses identical pāda openings  (4a, 4b, 4c, 5a: idā́ [hí] “[for] right now...”), with insistence on the here-and-now,  to modulate from the present situation and current poet to the mythological model  for the dawn and the associated distribution of treasures, namely the Aṅgirases  opening the Vala cave (vs. 5), which is presented as if it were happening now. As  often when this myth is mentioned as a model for the singer (see, e.g., V.45), there  is no mention of Indra, to whom the leadership in this deed is usually attributed.  By the end of verse 5 the mythical and successful Aṅgirases have merged with the  current poets, and the invocation of both is proclaimed as having come true. The  connection between past and present is continued in the pleas for wealth and fame  made in the last verse (6).
### 1
This very one, the daughter born of heaven dawning for us, has
awakened the human settlements,
she who with her glistening radiance amid the nights has been recognized  even across the nocturnal shades of darkness.
### 2
They have driven through it with their ruddy-yoked horses; brightly shine  the Dawns with their gleaming chariots.
Leading the vanguard of the lofty sacrifice, they thrust aside the
darkness of the night.
### 3
Bringing down to the pious mortal fame, reward, refreshment,
nourishment, o Dawns,864 VI.66
as bounteous masters of (wealth) in heroes, establish aid and a treasure  for the one who does honor today.
### 4
For right now there exists a treasure for the one who does you honor,  right now for the hero, for the pious one, o Dawns,
right now for the poet, when he sings his hymns. Even before you used to  carry (it) down to one such as me.
### 5
For right now the Aṅgirases are hymning the cowpens of the cows for  you, o Dawn, you who own the high backs of the mountains.
They have split (them) apart with their chant and sacred formulation.  The men’s invocation of the gods has come true.
### 6
Dawn for us, Daughter of Heaven, as of old, for the one who does (you)  honor like Bharadvāja, o bounteous one.
Grant wealth in good heroes to the singer. Confer wide-ranging fame  upon us.
## 66 
66 (507) Maruts
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The only hymn to the Maruts in Maṇḍala VI, this poem is complex, playful, allu sive, and very difficult in parts.
It begins with five dense and syntactically contorted verses about the birth of  the Maruts, a topic that regularly invites such treatment. The story of the birth is  introduced by a signal that it is esoteric knowledge; verse 1a announces it as a mar vel even for someone who really perceives properly. The rest of the verse is both a  paradox and a riddle: two entities have the same name, “milker,” but one of them  constantly gives milk, and the other has done so only once. The riddle is solved by  the last word of the verse, “udder”; the paradox juxtaposes the normal udder of  a cow, which constantly swells with milk, with the udder of the Marut’s mother,  Pr̥śni, who bore them, that is, milked them out, all at once. (This same phenom
enon is referred to in riddling terms in VI.48.22.) Verse 2 continues this theme, and  the other parent of the Maruts, their father Rudra, is introduced in verse 3. But  both 1 and 3 also allude to the androgynous behavior of the mother Pr̥śni, who  elsewhere (see esp. IV.3.10) is identified as a bull who gives milk that is identical  with semen; in verse 3 here she is the subject of the quintessentially male verb of  impregnation (gárbhaṃ √dhā “implant an embryo”). Verse 4 is the most opaque  verse in this sequence. It clearly describes the moment of the Maruts’ birth; they  did not resist being born, but in fact were milked out when they wished, after hav ing “purified their flaws” while still within her womb. A two-word expression early  in the verse (áyā nú) seems to have a double meaning: on the one hand, it is the  poet’s comment about the manner of birth: “now (it happened) in this way”; on the other, it can be read as the direct speech of the Maruts (considered as a group),  “Now I will go” (that is, be born), an indication of their moment of choice. The  final verse of the birth story relates the fact that Pr̥śni, having given them as milk,  did not give them milk after they were born, but they were undeterred. There is  much that is doubtful in our translation of these verses, but the main outlines seem  clear, while the tricks of the poet are much on display.
Though more of his tricks appear in the rest of the hymn, none of it is as dif ficult as these first five verses. Verse 6 turns on a pun between the word for the  “two world-halves” (ródasī) and the female who is often found as the Maruts’ lover,  Rodasī́ (distinguished from the first only by accent). The marvel of their journey  through the midspace is described in verse 7, and the good fortune of the man who  receives their aid in verse 8. The journey of verse 7 must be to carry them to our sac rifice, for the remaining verses bring the hymn to a fairly conventional end: in verse  9 we produce a hymn for the Maruts; in verse 10 they are compared to the ritual  fire, an appropriate simile if they are situated on the ritual ground; in the final verse  (10) the aim of attracting them to the sacrifice is made explicit and the competing  hymns of rival sacrificers are alluded to.
Unlike many Marut hymns, this one lacks any significant description of their  thunderstorm-like aspects.
### 1
Let this be a marvel even for one who (truly) perceives—(though) owning  the same name “milker,”
while the one stays swollen to give milk to mortals, only once did Pr̥śni  milk the gleaming (milk/semen) from (the other) udder.
### 2
Those who kept blazing up like fires being kindled, when the Maruts  were strengthened two or three times over—
dustless, golden were their (chariots)—they came into being all at once  with their manly and male powers.
### 3
Those who are the sons of Rudra the rewarder, and whom she was  stalwart (enough) to bear—
for she is known as the great mother of the great—just she, Pr̥śni,
implanted the embryo for good offspring.
### 4
Those who do not retreat from their birth: now (it happened) in this way  [/(saying) “Now I will go”]—purifying their flaws while still within
(their mother),
they were milked forth gleaming, at their pleasure, growing in splendor  all along their bodies.
### 5
Those for whom even right away [=right after their birth] the irrepressible  one [=Pr̥śni] was not there to give milk—those who, assuming the bold  name “Marut,”
did not (stand still) like posts, (but were themselves) irrepressible in their  greatness. Even now [/never] would the one of good drops [=Pr̥śni]
appease (those) mighty ones.
866 VI.67
### 6
Just these mighty ones in a bold host yoked both well-fixed
world-halves [=ródasī] through their vast power.
Then Rodasī mounted among these impetuous ones like a
self-blazing light.
### 7
Let your course be without antelopes, o Maruts, also without horses— the course that one who is no charioteer drives.
Without halt, without reins as it crosses the dusky realm, it travels
through the two world-halves along its paths, heading toward
its goal.
### 8
There exists now no one to obstruct, no one to overcome him whom  you aid in the winning of prizes, o Maruts,
whom (you aid in the winning) of progeny, of cows, of descendants, of  waters. He is the splitter of the (cow)pen just then at the decisive end  of the day.
### 9
Bring forward a brilliant chant for the singing, swift, self-strong  Marut(-troop).
Those who overpower powers with power, before (those) combatants  the earth trembles, o Agni.
### 10
Flaring like the dart of the ceremony [=ritual fire], stirring thirstily like  tongues of fire,
chanting like boisterous heroes, the Maruts with their flashing birth are  unassailable.
### 11
This Marut(-troop) grown strong, with flashing spears, the son(s) of  Rudra I seek to entice here with an invocation.
For (the favor of) the troop of heaven the gleaming inspired thoughts,  mighty like mountains or waters, have contended (with each other).
## 67 
67 (508) Mitra and Varuṇa
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
11 verses: triṣṭubh
This is the only hymn dedicated to Mitra and Varuṇa in Maṇḍala VI, though Indra  and Varuṇa are the recipients of the next, unremarkable hymn. By contrast, this  hymn is obscure in reference and meaning, and full of rare words, unclear morpho logical forms, contorted phraseology, puzzling imagery, and ellipses difficult to fill.  Our interpretation of the hymn both in detail and in general outline differs from the  many incompatible interpretations offered by other scholars (differences that we  cannot discuss here), but our interpretation does produce a clear structure within  which the many puzzles can be evaluated.
The hymn begins straightforwardly enough, with an exhortation to the priests  to offer ritual praise to Mitra and Varuṇa (vs. 1) and an invitation to the two gods to come to our ritual sacrifice (vss. 2, 3ab). This first section ends (3cd), in our view,  with an elaborated version of 1ab, declaring the gods’ power to control even the  rich and powerful.
The ritual context returns later in the hymn (vss. 7–8), and the two ritually  oriented portions frame a section relating to the birth of Mitra and Varuṇa from  Aditi (vs. 4) and the powers they assumed to regulate the cosmos (vss. 5–6). The  allusion to their birth recalls the lengthy birth narrative of the Maruts in the  immediately preceding hymn (VI.66.1–5). With the return to the ritual situation,  the two gods are first exhorted to drink the soma, whose preparation is described  in enigmatic terms (vs. 7). In verse 8, again in our view, the two gods receive a  summons from Agni (not named), the ritual fire through whom they will con sume ghee, because he finds they are not there. (See the calls in the structurally  matching vss. 2–3.)
This absence leads to the final section of the hymn (vss. 9–11), which appears  to treat the rivalry among competing sacrificers. If Mitra and Varuṇa are not at  our sacrifice (vs. 8b), they must be elsewhere. The poet describes these competi tors in extremely negative terms (vs. 9) as violating the ordinances that are the  most prominent feature of Mitra and Varuṇa’s moral command. In contrast,  verse 10 presents the proper ritual behavior and attitudes of our side, ending  with yet another affirmation of the gods’ power to control and set in place  the people (10d, reminiscent of 1cd and 3cd). And in the final verse (11) we  are ourselves properly placed in the shelter of Mitra and Varuṇa (a placement  first requested in vs. 2), hoping for generous gifts when the soma sacrifice is  performed. The last half-verse refers, in our view, to this sacrifice: the cows are  the milk mixture pursuing the straight-flying soma; the bold bull in battle-lust  is also the soma. But the expressions also evoke martial images appropriate to  the rivalry among sacrificers found in the preceding two verses. It is worth not
ing that the preceding hymn also made brief allusion to sacrificial rivalry in its  final verse (VI.66.11).
### 1
Of all beings the most preeminent, Mitra and Varuṇa are to be
continuously strengthened by your songs.
The best controllers, the two without equal, who, like reins, firmly
control the peoples with their own arms.
### 2
This inspired thought from me is spread forth for you two, (calling you)  two dear ones with homage to the ritual grass.
Hold forth to us, Mitra and Varuṇa, the unbesiegable shelter of yours  that provides defense, o you of good drops.
### 3
Drive hither, Mitra and Varuṇa, dear ones being called to (the ritual  grass) with good recitation, with homage.
You two who like industrious workers firmly (control) (even) the peoples  ensconced in prosperity, you set in their place even those (who
themselves say) “listen!” [=bosses], with your greatness.
868 VI.68
### 4
When at her season Aditi (was ready) to bear as embryo (the two) who  like prizewinning horses were of pure breed,
who were being born forth greatly great, she pushed downward (at
delivery) the two to be terrible for the cheating mortal.
### 5
Since all the gods in concert, being exhilarated, magnanimously  established dominion for you two,
such that you two surround even the two wide world-halves, there exist  spies (in your service), undeceivable, ungullible.
### 6
Because you uphold your dominion through the days and you make  firm (heaven’s) back as if from highest heaven,
firm (also) is the heavenly body [=sun], and belonging to all the gods  it has stretched to earth and to heaven with the gushing [=rain] of
those two [=Mitra and Varuṇa].
### 7
You should appropriate the lively (soma) to fill your belly, when those  of the same pedigree [=soma-pressing fingers?] fill the seat.
The unsurpassable maidens [=fingers] are not neglectful when they
distribute their milk [=soma], o you two who enliven all.
### 8
(You) two (does) the one of good wisdom [=Agni] always (call) here  with his tongue, when the true wheel (of the sacrifice) [=Agni] has
come to be without you.
Let this be your greatness, you who have ghee for food: you open up the  narrow place for the pious one.
### 9
When they start contending over you two but violate the dear
ordinances ordained by you, Mitra and Varuṇa,
they, not attending upon the sacrifice, are neither gods, despite their
vaunting, nor mortals, but like children who do not swell [=grow/thrive]. 10. When the praisers distribute their speech and some recite the formal  invocations, paying them heed,
after that we will speak to you pronouncements that come true: “No  one (will violate your ordinances). You set in their places (the
peoples) along with the gods by your greatness.”
### 11
In just this way, in the charge of you two and of your shelter, (we seek)  of you, Mitra and Varuṇa, (giving) that is not stunted,
when the cows [=milk mixture] will bound after the straight-flying one  [=soma], when they will yoke the bold bull [=soma] in battle-lust.
## 68 
68 (509) Indra and Varuṇa
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 9–10
The theme of ritual reciprocity dominates here, with praise of the two dedi cands fairly spare, whether individual or joint. The message is simple: the piously performed sacrifice that we offer to the two gods should be generously rewarded  with wealth.
The sacrifice is announced in the first verse, as an enticement to bring the two  gods here. The praise, such as it is, comes in the next three verses, a series of super latives characterizing them both in verse 2, a contrastive glance at their respective  functions in the second half of verse 3, and an assertion that the two are preeminent  even among the other gods in verse 4. (Verse 4 is also noteworthy for the gendered  description of the gods; female deities are not usually given recognition when the  gods in general are mentioned.)
Wealth is the target of the middle verses (5–8), wealth for priests and patrons  alike. The word rayí “wealth” is prominent in all four verses.
The final verses (9–11) depict the here-and-now of the sacrifice, happening  in real time, as it were, signaled by an occurrence of a form of the annunciatory  near-deictic pronoun (“here is/this here”) in each verse (ayám 9c, imám 10a, idám 11c). The gods are present at our sacrifice and urged to drink the soma formally  announced to them.
### 1
The sacrifice has been raised up in concert with obedience, for the man  who has twisted the ritual grass to perform sacrifice to you two, as
Manu (did)—
(the sacrifice) that will turn Indra and Varuṇa here today for great
refreshment and for great favor.
### 2
For you two are the most glorious among the gods with your thrusting,  and you two are the mightiest of mighty warriors,
the most bountiful of bountiful benefactors, powerfully forceful, fully  armed, overcoming obstacles by truth.
### 3
By reason of their favors, sing to Indra and Varuṇa, who take delight,  with forceful, reverential (songs).
The one smites Vr̥tra with his might and mace; the other as inspired poet  attends upon the (ritual) enclosures.
### 4
When all the gods, both ladies and men, grow strong, (their praises) sung  for their own sake by (our) men,
you stand out from them by your greatness, o Indra and Varuṇa, (and  also you two) wide ones, o Heaven and Earth.
### 5
Just he acquires good gifts and good help and possesses the truth who  ritually serves you, o Indra and Varuṇa, in his own person.
With refreshment he, possessing gifts, could overcome hostilities; he will  gain wealth and wealthy peoples.
### 6
The wealth that you two provide to the man who performs pious  ceremonies—wealth consisting of goods and much livestock—
may that abide in us, o Indra and Varuṇa—(the wealth) that shatters the  taunts of the rapacious ones.
### 7
And, o Indra and Varuṇa, for our patrons may there be wealth offering  good protection, with gods as its herdsmen—
870 VI.69
(our patrons) whose impetuous force, victorious in battles, surpassingly  extends their éclat all at once.
### 8
Now, Indra and Varuṇa, as you are being sung, replenish our wealth for  the excellence of our fame, o gods.
In just this way singing the force of the great one, might we cross over  difficulties, as if over waters by boat.
### 9
Now chant forth at length your own dear thought to the lofty sovereign  king, to the god Varuṇa.
Here is the one of great commandments who radiates through the two  wide (worlds) with his greatness and by his resolve, like unaging (fire)  with its flame.
### 10
O Indra and Varuṇa, soma-drinkers—drink this exhilarating pressed  soma here, o you of steadfast commandments.
Your chariot drives to the ceremony for attracting the gods, (as if) to  good pasture to drink.
### 11
O Indra and Varuṇa, you bulls—drench yourselves in the most
honeyed, bullish soma.
This stalk has been poured all around for you here among us. Having  sat down on this ritual grass, bring yourselves to exhilaration.

69 (510) Indra and Viṣṇu
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
8 verses: triṣṭubh
The focus of most of this hymn is entirely ritual, with the two divine recipients of  the hymn treated as a unit. The gods are repeatedly urged to come together to the  sacrifice, to enjoy the various forms of praise, and to drink the soma—as well as  to give us wealth in return. Only one verse (4) is devoted to the gods’ deeds, with  the “wide striding” that is Viṣṇu’s best-known exploit attributed to both of them.  Their unity is reinforced by the grammar. Every verse in this hymn contains a voca
tive address to the two gods, always in a dvandva compound, except for the final  verse (8).
In that verse, the two gods are grammatically separated though still addressed  in the vocative, and this grammatical change marks a sharp change in conception  as well. Though it is emphasized in the first half of the verse that both have con quered and not been conquered, in the second half it is said that they contended  with each other, but in the end divided the stake of a thousand (cows?) in thirds,  with each taking a part. As Geldner points out, this dispute between Indra and  Viṣṇu is referred to a number of times in early Vedic prose and later, and according  to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (VII.1.5.5) Indra received two thirds of the stake, Viṣṇu  one third. The hymn thus springs a surprise at its end, by this glancing allusion to strife between the two gods who were depicted throughout the rest of the hymn as  an indissoluble pair.
The language and style of most of the hymn are unremarkable and somewhat  repetitive. Noteworthy are verses 2 and 3, with parallel structures in their second  halves, deploying parallel puns on day (the sun’s rays) and night, homonymous with  words referring to verbal productions at the sacrifice.
### 1
With ritual action and with refreshment I propel both of you together, o  Indra and Viṣṇu, to the far shore of this labor.
Enjoy the sacrifice and confer wealth, causing us to cross on paths free  of harm.
### 2
O Indra and Viṣṇu, who are the begetters of all thoughts, the two tubs  holding soma—
let the hymns as they are being recited help you forward, forward the  praises as they are being sung in the form of chants [/along with the  rays (of the sun)].
### 3
O Indra and Viṣṇu, exhilaration-lords of the exhilarating drinks, drive  here to the soma, while conferring wealth.
Let the praises as they are being recited in solemn words anoint both  of you together with the ointments of thoughts [/through the
nights].
### 4
Let your horses, vanquishing hostility, sharers in exhilaration, convey  you two here, o Indra and Viṣṇu.
Enjoy all the invocations of our thoughts. Harken to my sacred
formulations, my hymns.
### 5
O Indra and Viṣṇu, this (deed) of yours is worthy of admiration: in the  exhilaration of soma you two strode widely;
you made the midspace wider; you spread out the realms for us to live. 6. O Indra and Viṣṇu, you who eat first, you on whom the oblation is  bestowed with reverence—having grown strong through the oblation, confer wealth on us, o you whose drink is ghee. You two are the sea, the  tub holding soma.
### 7
O Indra and Viṣṇu, drink of this honey, of the soma, o wondrous ones.  Fill your belly.
The exhilarating stalks have come to you. Harken to my sacred
formulations, my call.
### 8
You both have conquered; you are not conquered. Neither one of these  two has been conquered.
O Viṣṇu and you Indra, when you two were contending, you broke apart  the thousand in three parts.

70 (511) Heaven and Earth
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: jagatī
This celebration of Heaven and Earth associates them with all sorts of beneficial  liquids. The first word in the hymn is “ghee,” and in the rest of that verse we find  milk, honey, and semen, all of which recur in the hymn: note especially the parallel  verses 4 and 5 devoted to ghee and honey respectively. Besides these liquid endow
ments, the physical qualities of the two divinities are barely mentioned; it is instead  their status as objects of worship and praise at the sacrifice and their ability to grant  rewards to us that preoccupy the poet.
### 1
The two rich in ghee, excelling in glory over the creatures, wide and  broad, milking out honey, well-ornamented—
Heaven and Earth were propped apart according to the foundation of  Varuṇa, the two unaging ones possessing abundant semen.
### 2
Never drying up, with abundant streams, rich in milk, they milk  out ghee for the good performer (of rituals), the two of pure
commandments.
Ruling over this creation, you two World-Halves, for us pour the semen,  as was established by Manu.
### 3
The mortal who, to stride straight, ritually serves you two—you
World-Halves, you two Holy Places—that one reaches his goal.
He is propagated through his progeny forth from your foundation. Those  (creatures) that are poured out from you, (though) of diverse forms,  have the same commandments.
### 4
Heaven and Earth, covered over with ghee, glorious with ghee, mixing  with ghee, strong through ghee,
wide and broad, set in front at the choosing of the Hotar—just these two  do the inspired poets reverently invoke, to seek their favor.
### 5
Let Heaven and Earth trickle honey on us, the two dripping with honey,  milking out honey, having honeyed commandments,
through their divinity establishing sacrifice for themselves, and material  wealth, great fame, the prize of victory, and an abundance of heroes  for us.
### 6
Nourishment let both Heaven and Earth swell for us—father and mother,  all-knowing, of wondrous power.
Jointly bestowing, let the two World-Halves, beneficial for all, jointly  impel gain, the prize of victory, and wealth to us.

71 (512) Savitar
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: jagatī 1–3, triṣṭubh 4–6
The two halves of this hymn (vss. 1–3, 4–6) are distinguished by meter, and in fact  they appear to have been originally two hymns, which pattern together in vocabu lary and themes. Geldner suggests that the first is a morning hymn, the second an  evening hymn.
The parallelism is especially clear at the beginning: the first verses of each (1,  4) begin identically: “Up this god Savitar...” (úd u ṣyá deváḥ savitā́...) and fol low with a mention of his golden arms/hands. The second verses (2, 5) are each  appropriate for the time of day they represent: in the morning hymn (vs. 2) Savitar  impels the creatures forth to their daily activities, while in the evening hymn (vs.  5) he brings them to rest. The third verses (3, 6) make the expected pleas for help  and benefit from the god.
### 1
Up has this god Savitar raised his two golden arms for impelling, the  very resolute one.
He sprinkles his hands with ghee, the young battler of good skill, in his  spreading apart of the dusky realm.
### 2
May we be (there) at the best impulsion of the god Savitar and for his  giving of goods—
you [=Savitar] who are (busy) at bringing to rest and at impelling forth  the whole two-footed and four-footed creation.
### 3
With your kindly, undeceivable protectors, o Savitar, today protect our  household all around.
You of golden tongue, guard us for our ever newer welfare; let none who  curse hold sway over us.
### 4
Up has this god Savitar stood—the golden-handed friend of the house— facing evening [=toward the west].
Copper-jawed, deserving the sacrifice, possessing a gladdening tongue,  he impels here to the pious man much of value.
### 5
And up has Savitar raised his golden arms with their lovely fronts like  the Upavaktar priest.
He has mounted the heights of heaven, of earth; he has brought to rest  whatever is flying, even the formless [=wind].
### 6
A thing of value today, o Savitar, and one of value tomorrow—day after  day impel to us a thing of value,
for, o god, *you have control over much of value. Through this poetic  insight may we be partakers of the valuables.874 VI.72–73

72 (513) Indra and Soma
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Each verse in this brief hymn begins with a vocative addressing the two recipients  of the hymn, joined in a dual dvandva compound. Each of the verses recounts  one or more of Indra’s cosmogonic deeds or his beneficial acts for mankind,  here ascribed equally to both gods. Since Indra needs to drink soma in order to  accomplish his feats, this sharing of credit is not surprising. Some of the acts are  expressed in the past tense, some in the present, even those that belong to the  mythical past like the smashing of the serpent (vs. 3). The language is straight
forward, even in the expression of the familiar paradox in verse 4 of the cooked  milk found in the raw cows.
### 1
Indra and Soma, great is this greatness of you two. You did the first great  things:
you found the sun; you found the sunlight; you smashed away all the  shades of darkness—and the scorners.
### 2
Indra and Soma, you make the dawn shine; you lead the sun upward  with its light.
You propped up the heaven with a prop; you spread out Mother Earth. 3. Indra and Soma, you smash the serpent surrounding the waters—Vr̥tra.  Heaven gave consent to you.
You roused forth the floods of the rivers; you filled the many (floods) of  the sea.
### 4
Indra and Soma, you deposited the cooked (milk) within the raw (cows),  just in the udders of the cows.
You held the gleaming (milk), (though) it was not tied on, within the  dappled, moving (cows).
### 5
Indra and Soma, it is you, certainly, who bestowed surpassing (wealth),  bringing descendants in its train, worthy of fame.
You made unbridled force, manly and victorious in battle, as cloak for  the settled domains, you strong ones.
## 73 
73 (514) Br̥haspati
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
3 verses: triṣṭubh
In this brief hymn Br̥haspati is credited with many of Indra’s exploits and is  described with Indraic vocabulary. It is only in the very last word of the hymn “with  his chants” (arkaíḥ) that the particular character of Br̥haspati and his particular  role in the opening of the Vala cave, that of singer and formulator, are referred to. 1. He who is splitter of the stone, first born, possessed of truth—Br̥haspati  Āṅgirasa, possessing the oblation—
(*filling) the doubly exalted earth, sitting in front of the heated pot, our  father the bull keeps bellowing to the two world-halves.
### 2
Br̥haspati, who even for such a man (as me) has made wide space at the  invocation to the gods,
smashing obstacles, he keeps splitting apart the strongholds, conquering  rivals, overcoming enemies in battles.
### 3
Br̥haspati entirely conquered goods; this god conquered the great  enclosures full of cattle.
When he sets out to win the waters and the sun, Br̥haspati is
unopposable. He smites the foe with his chants.
## 74 
74 (515) Soma and Rudra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
4 verses: triṣṭubh
Although there is another R̥gvedic hymn dedicated to Rudra and Soma (I.43), in  that hymn they are invoked and described in separate verses; this hymn is the only  place in which the two gods are invoked jointly, in a dual dvandva compound that  appears in every verse and is found only in this hymn. Indeed, the gods have little in  common, and the elements in this hymn that are not generic to divinity in general  are applicable only to Rudra—in particular, the plea to destroy disease (vs. 2) and  give healing remedies (vs. 3). The adjective “very kindly” (suśévau) in verse 4 is  etymologically related to and anticipates the epithet śíva “kindly,” which later char acterizes Rudra (already R̥V X.92.9) and ultimately replaces his name.
### 1
O Soma and Rudra, uphold your lordly power; let our desires [/sacrifices]  reach you fittingly.
Depositing seven treasures in every house, be weal for our two-footed,  weal for our four-footed.
### 2
O Soma and Rudra, tear out, tear to pieces the disease that has entered  our household.
Drive calamity into the distance far away. For us let there be auspicious  things bringing good fame.
### 3
O Soma and Rudra, place all these healing remedies on us, in our bodies. Unhitch, release the outrage committed (by us,) which is bound onto our  bodies—(release it) from us.
### 4
You two with sharp weapons, with sharp missiles, very kindly—o Soma  and Rudra, be merciful to us here.
Release us from the noose of Varuṇa; protect us, showing your
benevolence.

75 (516) Weapons
Pāyu Bhāradvāja
19 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 6, 10; anuṣṭubh 12–13, 15–16, 19
This supplemental hymn attached to the end of the maṇḍala is one of the most  memorable and delightful in the R̥gveda. It praises the weapons of battle and their  parts, and it is structured as a list of riddles. Each weapon receives one verse; some times the weapon is named at the beginning of the verse (as in vs. 2), but more often  it is found only toward the end, preceded by a riddling definition. Particularly strik ing are the verses in which the subject is described as a seductive woman or tender  mother (vss. 3–4), a characterization that contrasts sharply with the violence of  battle. (Weapons so described are feminine in grammatical gender.) In the following  translation the weapon that is the answer to the riddle is italicized.
The hymn is more or less metrically unified for the first ten verses, and verse 10  reads like a hymn-final verse, breaking the riddle pattern to beg a collection of gods  and ancestors for protection. The rest of the hymn alternates trimeter and dimeter  meter, and although the riddling verses continue (vss. 11, 13–15), there is also direct  address to the weapons themselves and prayers to various gods for protection. The  more various character of this second part of the hymn has led some scholars to  consider it an even later addition, although this does not seem a necessary conclu
sion. The final verse (19) calls down destruction on every type of enemy and affirms  the primacy of the protective sacred formulation—as “inner armor,” thus paired  with the outer armor (the same word várman) found in the first verse of the hymn.  Thus, whether secondarily or not, the hymn has a faint ring structure.
### 1
His mien is like that of a thundercloud, when he drives armored into the  lap of battles.
With an unpierceable body, conquer! Let the greatness of your armor carry you through.
### 2
With the bow may we win cattle, with the bow the contest, with the bow  may we win the sharp battles.
The bow banishes the (battle-)lust of our rival. With the bow may we  win all the quarters.
### 3
Just like (a woman) about to speak, she keeps going up to his ear, while  embracing her dear partner.
Like a maiden (with her anklets?), she jangles when stretched out on the  bow: this bowstring here that makes (the arrow) cross over into the
melee (as if to a [festive] gathering).
### 4
The two faring forth to the melees, like a maiden to (festive) gatherings— let them carry (the arrow) as a mother does a child in her lap.
Let them pierce our rivals when the two find each other: these bow-ends here when they spring apart (against) the enemies. 5. Father of many (daughters [=arrows]), he (also) has many a son; he  makes a clattering when he descends into the melees.
The quiver, tied onto the back, wins clashes and battles—all of them— when it is thrust into action.
### 6
Standing on the chariot, he leads the prizewinners [=horses] forward  wherever he desires: the good charioteer.
Admire the greatness of the reins. The cords guide, following the
(charioteer’s) mind (though it is) behind them.
### 7
They make their sharp cries—the bullish-hooved horses along with the  chariots, as they seek the prize,
trampling down the enemies with their forefeet, they destroy our rivals,  without (even) divesting (them of their armor).
### 8
The chariot-stand, “Oblation(-deposit)” its name, where his weapon, his  armor is deposited—
there may we reverently approach the powerful chariot always when we  seek its benevolence.
### 9
The forefathers: assembling for the sweet (soma), conferring vigor, they  who are props in distress, skillful, deep,
with glittering weapons, arrow-strong, not shirking, entirely heroic,  broad, overwhelming the troops.
### 10
O Brahmins, forefathers, deserving of soma, let Heaven and Earth,  blameless ones, (be) kindly to us;
let Pūṣan protect us from difficult passage, you who are strong through  truth. Guard (us): let none who curse hold sway over us.
### 11
She wears the fine-feathered (eagle); a wild deer is her tooth. Lashed  together with cows, she flies when propelled forth.
Where men clash and separate, there will our arrows provide shelter  for us.
### 12
You (arrow, though) of straight course, avoid us. Let our body become  a rock.
Let Soma speak on our behalf; let Aditi provide us shelter.
### 13
It smashes hard on their back, keeps beating at their haunches— o horsewhip, impel the cautious horses into battles.
### 14
Like a snake with its coils, it encircles the arm, parrying the blow of the  bowstring—
the handguard, knowing all the trajectories (of the bowstring): as a male  let it protect the male all around.
### 15
She who is smeared with poison, with the head of a deer, but whose  mouth is metal:
here is lofty reverence to her who has (received) the semen of Thunder,  to the goddess Arrow.
878 VI.75
### 16
Once released, fly away, you arrow, sharpened by a sacred formulation. Go to the enemies; fall on them. Do not leave a single one of them  standing.
### 17
Where the darts fly together, like lads with unruly hair,
there let Brahmaṇaspati, let Aditi provide us shelter—always provide  shelter.
### 18
Your vulnerable places I cover with armor; let Soma the king clothe you  with immortality.
Let Varuṇa make (a space) wider than wide for you; let the gods cheer  you on as you win.
### 19
Whoever wishes to smite us—one of our own or a foreigner, or even  one outside the pale—
him let all the gods injure. The sacred formulation is my inner armor.
