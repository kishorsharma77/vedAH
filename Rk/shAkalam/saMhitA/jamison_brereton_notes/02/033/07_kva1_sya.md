In b the yó ásti … clause might appear to be embedded in the main clause, if c resumes the question posed in a. However, c could simply be part of the rel. cl.

Even if b is embedded, it is unproblematic, since nominal rel. clauses are an exception to the no-embedding rule, functioning rather like izafe-s.

In d abhī́… cakṣamīthāḥ reprises 1c abhí … kṣameta. Given that final lengthening in the preverb abhí is extremely rare (Lub: 739 abhí, 14 abhī́.), I am inclined to interpr. the form as abhí ī, with the enclitic acc. anticipating the obj. mā, esp. given that in vs. 1 in this same idiom abhí appears without length.
