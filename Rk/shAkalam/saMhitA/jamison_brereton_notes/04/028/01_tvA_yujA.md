The construction in b -- apáḥ … sasrútas kaḥ, lit. “made the waters flowing,” with an acc. pl. adjectival root-noun cmpd. modifying ‘waters’ -- is a little odd. In this type of periphrastic causative context with √kṛ, we expect a complement infinitive.

Perhaps it anticipates the akṛṇoḥ NOUN-ACC ADJ-ACC constructions in 4cd, where there exist no alternative infinitive possibilities. (The publ. tr. “made the waters flow” rather than “… flowing” is meant to avoid an interpr.
