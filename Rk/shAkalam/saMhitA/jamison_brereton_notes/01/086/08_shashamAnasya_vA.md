I take the vā here as inverse, connecting the two double gen. phrases śaśamānásya … svédasya and kā́masya vénataḥ, though it appears after the first word of the first gen. phrase (śaśamānásya vā … svédasya …). Klein (DGRV II: 205) also thinks an inverse reading is possible (though he doesn’t use the term), but he also suggests vā here might be equivalent to vaí. This seems unnecessary, and the inverse interpretation gets some support from the inversion of the syntax in vs. 7.

Note the chiastic structure of the two genitive phrases: in the first the personal participle śaśamānásya depends on the material svédasya, while the likewise personal participle vénataḥ depends on kā́masya.
