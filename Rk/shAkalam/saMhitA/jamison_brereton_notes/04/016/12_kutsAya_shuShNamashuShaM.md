Note the phonological play in śúṣṇam aśúṣam “insatiable Śuṣṇa.” With Old (flg. Ge, Ved. St.; see also Hoffmann (Injunk. 189) I interpret the hapax kutsyá- ‘Kutsian’ in light of the phrase vadháṃ kútsam (I.175.4) “Kutsa (as) deadly weapon.” The “future imperative” vṛhatāt in d follows nicely on the normal impv. prá mṛṇa in c.
