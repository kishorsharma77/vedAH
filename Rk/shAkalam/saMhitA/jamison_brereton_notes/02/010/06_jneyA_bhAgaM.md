The first pāda of this vs. continues the theme of trying to set limits on the unpredictably powerful Agni. (In my view; it is not so interpr. by others.) Here he is urged (again with a precative, jñeyāḥ) to know or recognize his share. I take this to mean that he should take his share and no more, though his power would allow him to take whatever he wants (sahasānó váreṇa). Agni thus controlled will then help the singer to achieve his goals (pādas bcd).

Note that Manu returns from the 1st vs. — another little ring. The adj.

madhupṛ́cam ‘mixing with honey’ reminds us of the later Madhuparka drink offered to distinguished visitors, but I doubt that such a reference is found here. Though it would be generally appropriate for Agni the átithi- (‘guest’), this hospitality theme, though common in the RV, is not found in this hymn.

For the pun in the 2nd half vs., see publ. intro.
