 O bull Indra—these pressed drops, the drink of a bull, pressed by the  stones, are bursting out—for you are the pressed (drops) bursting  out.
Let them invigorate you to giving, to great, glittering generosity. Being praised with songs, you whose vehicle is songs, come here—very  compassionate to us, come here.
