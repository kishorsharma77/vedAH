Whether the referent of the ‘unshining’ (arúcaḥ) is the same as that of the ‘unlit’ (adyútaḥ) of 3a, namely the nights (aktū́n 3a), is unclear. Hoffmann suggests so, with ?, and I see nothing against it. Both adyút- and arúc- are hapaxes in the RV, so we can’t bring to bear other usages of these words.

Ge (explicitly n. 2b) considers ṛtayúj- here as having a different sense from the same cmpd. in vs. 2: “mit dem Recht im Bunde” (2b) versus “mit den rechtzeitig geschirrten Rossen” (4c). Even if ṛtá- ever had the sense ‘timely, punctual’ (which it does not), it is inconceivable to me that in a hymn of this length, the poet would use the same cmpd. in two very different senses, within two vss. of each other and marking the boundaries of an omphalos. Schmidt (149) also considers this unlikely, though he attributes the contrary view to Lüders, who, as far as I can see, doesn’t hold it or at least explicitly state it; Scar (425) temporizes in his disc., though he tr.

the other three instances of ṛtayúj- (incl. our vs. 4), all modifying ‘horses’, with the anodyne ‘wohlgeschirrten’, as opposed to our vs. 2, which he renders ‘der Verbündete des Ṛta’ -- in other words, implicitly following Ge’s differentiation. I would alter the publ. tr. from “whose yoke is truth” to “yoked with truth,” as in vs. 2.
