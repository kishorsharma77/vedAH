Agni
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
13 verses: triṣṭubh
A rather stately hymn, appropriate for the first in the Agni sequence in Maṇḍala VI.  It concerns only the ritual fire, with almost no mention of its physical substance, and unlike the typical dawn kindling sequence, the hymn depicts the arrival and  installation of Agni as Hotar and, especially, the ritual fire as joint possession  and responsibility of the whole Ārya community, as Proferes (2007:  33)  points  out. As the first hymn in the maṇḍala, it thus establishes an image of a settled and  well-ordered society unified in its devotion to the gods to which the rest of the  maṇḍala will be dedicated.
The arrival and installation occupy verses 1–3; verses 4–8 show Agni’s reach  through the community, from the individual house, to the clan and settlements, and  indeed to all who claim Manu (the first sacrificer) as ancestor. Verses 9–10 detail  the homage and service Agni deserves, and the remaining verses (11–13) the favors  we ask in return.
