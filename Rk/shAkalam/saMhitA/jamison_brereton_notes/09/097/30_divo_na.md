I take áhnām as a 2nd, unmarked simile dependent on sárgāḥ, rather than supplying a different headnoun, as Ge and Re do. They are surely both right that “the surges of/from heaven” are the rains. As for “the surges of the days,” this could either refer to the passage of time or to an abundance of light; I favor the former.

In b ná should be read as both the simile particle and the negation; see Old.

Pādas b-c show a clever chaining of significant vocabulary. In b Soma is compared to a king who doesn’t violate his alliance, with mitrá- in its common noun usage. But d contains the part. yatāná- ‘taking one’s place, being put in place’, and √yat is an action esp. associated with the god Mitra. Cf., e.g., VII.36.2 jánaṃ ca mitró yatati “Mitra puts the people in their place” (sim. III.59.1). Although Mitra is not explicitly present here, the lexical continuity might evoke him. It is indeed possible that it is Mitra’s intentions (or those of the alliance itself) acdg. to which Soma takes his place, rather than “ours” as in the publ. tr.

The vs. ends with yet another term relating to social life, namely víś- ‘clan’; as king, Soma would exert himself on behalf of this social unit.
