The publ. tr. doesn’t make it sufficiently clear that “without resting” qualifies the “tawny (horse).” Ge and Re construe gen. índrasya with the chariot, while I take it with the comrade - and Ober vacillates (comrade II.100, chariot II.204). Since índrasya is positioned between chariot and comrade, word order doesn’t help. In my view ‘comrade’ is inherently relational and generally needs to be defined with reference to another being or beings, as comrade to someone, hence my tr. See also nearby
