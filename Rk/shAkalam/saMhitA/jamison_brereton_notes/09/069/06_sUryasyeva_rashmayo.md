Both Ge and Re assume that the ná in a is wrongly placed and that the simile really targets usríyaḥ (though they both somehow work the two mothers into it). I think rather that mātárā ná is the complete simile and the “two mothers” are being compared to the gapped goal “Heaven and Earth.” Cf. IX.97.13 nadáyann eti prthiv ̥ ī́m utá dyā́m “roaring he goes to H+E” to our nā́nadad eti. The “two mothers” as stand-ins for H+E are found in our little group of hymns in IX.68.4 sá mātárā vicáran.

The 2nd hemistich is difficult to sort out because it is unclear how to distribute the series of acc. sgs. in c: ṛtám prathamám yát súvarṇaram. I take all three together, with ṛtám modified by prathamám and further specified by yát svàrṇaram, a nominal izafe-type construction, all as obj. of jānán. Ge (and Re) take everything up to yát as obj. of jānán, but svàrṇaram as obj. of avṛṇīta. Lü (396) has ṛtám as obj.

of jānán, yát svàrṇaram as obj. of avṛṇīta, and prathamám as adv. All three take svàrṇara- as a place name: for Ge a place famous for its soma, for Lüders the Himmelsquell of soma. But, as disc. ad IV.21.3, svàrṇara- is a name only in VIII; otherwise it seems to refer to a “realm of solar glory,” different from Heaven and Earth, as shown by IV.21.3 and X.65.4, where Heaven and Earth and various other places appear parallel to svàrṇara-.

However we distribute the accusatives, each of us has to decide what this hemistich is trying to say, and I would not say that any of us has succeeded in this.

With regard to my own interpr., I tentatively suggest that once again its subject is the earthly, ritual soma; in his cosmic journey to and through Heaven and Earth he recognizes the sun as “the first truth” and chooses it as his alter ego, his cosmic doublet, which resounds to his own glorification. In this paraphrase I realize that it is unclear why this is the “first” truth, and I therefore consider it possible that prathamám is adverbial, as Lü takes it - and suggest an alternate tr. “first recognizing the truth that is the realm of solar splendor …” But all this is very sketchy.
