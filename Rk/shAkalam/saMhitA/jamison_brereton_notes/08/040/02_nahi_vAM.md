The hapax vavráyāmahe is somewhat puzzling. It appears to be a denom. to vavrá- ‘hole’, with accent retraction because it is transitive (so Jamison, -áya-, 88-89). This deriv. goes back to Bartholomae and is endorsed by Old, for want of anything better. But what is its point in context? Here Re seems to show the way, taking it as oppositional to the following pāda, which begins with the contrastive particle átha: “But we sacrifice just (/especially) to Indra.” The idea is that, though the hymn is dedicated to both Indra and Agni, we don’t put the two gods in the same undifferentiated category, “in the (same) hole,” as it were, but treat them individually.

As noted in the publ. intro., the two gods are treated with more independence than in most Indra and Agni hymns (which isn’t saying much).
