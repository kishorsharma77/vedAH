The metrical structure encourages construing ójasā with sutásya -- so Ge “wenn der Bull mit Kraft ausgepresst ist.” However, I think it likely that the ójas- expressions are otherwise identical, but dhā́man- and rūpá- are both well-established belongs to Soma, rather than the pressers, and have therefore taken it with the participial VP in c. Re seems to take it with the verb of pāda a: “Ses jets ont coulé en avant … d’une forceformidable.” Note the unaccented asya in the first pāda, allowable because the referent is unmistakable. Cf. asmai in IX.11.1a and IX.70.1a.
