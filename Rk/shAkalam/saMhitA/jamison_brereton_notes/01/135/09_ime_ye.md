The references here are also murky, but I am inclined to see the plural referents as both Maruts and soma drinks. In favor of the Maruts: 1) they are called bāhv-òjas -in VIII.20.6; 2) they are sometimes called ukṣán- (e.g., V.52.3); 3) the non-waning cows of 8ef are also found in the Marut hymn V.55.5 ná vo dasrā úpa dasyanti dhenávaḥ; 4) they fly (e.g. V.59.7), and they're associated with the shaking of mountains and the flowing of rivers (flying in the river could be rain); 5) approaching the figtree in 8b might be like V.54.12, where they “shake the gleaming berry (píppalam)” -- the pippala is supposed to be a fig.

nadī́is one of the rare loc. sg.s to a vṛkī́-fem.; see sarasī́in VIII.103.2, gaurī́ in IX.12.3, and AiG III.170.
