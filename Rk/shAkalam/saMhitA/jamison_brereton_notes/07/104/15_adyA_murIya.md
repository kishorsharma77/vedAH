I use the standard English rendering of yātudhā́na- (with cognates well attested also in Old and Middle Iranian) as ‘sorcerer’ (German Zauberer), without any implications about what practices this figure might engage in. Since in the RV the word is found only in “popular” discourse, he presumably doesn’t work his ill through orthodox ritual means.
