Soma Pavamāna
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
9 verses: gāyatrī
The first verse, with its mention of Vāyu and Indra, identifies this as the first soma offering of the day. Otherwise the hymn is a confection of clichés familiar from  many other soma hymns.
## 1
As he is being purified, Soma rushes in a thousand streams beyond the  sheep [=fleece]
to his encounter with Vāyu and Indra.
## 2
You who are seeking help, sing forth to the self-purifying inspired poet, who has been pressed to pursue the gods.
## 3
The thousand-faceted soma juices purify themselves to win the prize, being hymned to pursue the gods.
## 4
And for us to win the prize, by purifying yourself (bring) lofty
refreshments
and a heaven-bright abundance of heroes, o drop.
## 5
By purifying themselves, let them bring thousandfold wealth and an  abundance of heroes for us—
the divine drops being pressed.
## 6
Like racehorses being driven on by their drivers, they have surged to win  the prize—
swift across the sheep’s fleece.
## 7
Bellowing like cows to their calf, the drops rush.
They have run between the hands (of the priest).
## 8
Pleasing to Indra, exhilarating, constantly roaring—o self-purifying one, strike away all hatreds.
## 9
Striking away the non-givers, purifying yourselves, looking like the sun, sit on the womb of truth.
