As discussed ad I.151.8, I take ná práyuktiḥ (-ir in sandhi) as short for mánaso ná práyukti-, as in that passage and X.30.1. I would in fact now go further and suggest that the nom. sg. práyuktir here is a redactional change for práyukti, the short-vowel instr. found at VI.11.1, X.30.1, and I would change the publ. tr. to “as if

*with the yoking up (of mind).” The form would have been changed to match the two
other nom. sg.s to -ti-stems in this hemistich, prástutir and suvṛktíḥ (both given in their sandhi forms), and it would also avoid hiatus over the pāda boundary.

As for dhā́ma, I take it, as I do in I.152.4d, as an accusative of respect: “following/with regard to the ordinance.” This verse has another reminiscence of the preceding Mitra and Varuṇa hymns in pāda c: the Hotar here anoints (anákti) Mitra and Varuṇa as an unidentified plural set of ritual officiants do in I.151.8 (yuvā́m … añjate), the same verse containing the yoking of mind.
