The particle báḍ seems to mean ‘in truth, for certain, yes indeed’ and, despite appearances, may have Avestan cognates. baḷā́here is clearly based on it.

Hoffmann (Aufs. II.355) takes the expression here as a kind of internal quotation: “nicht habe ich ja zu einem anderen gesagt: báḍ, du bist ein Erbarmer,” though the direct speech is only represented by the particle and then only indirectly. My tr. is an attempt to capture Hoffmann’s sense while sticking closer to the grammar.
