Agni
Gr̥tsamada
6 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins with a 3rd-person past-time reference to the installation of Agni,  and seems also to refer obliquely to the myth of Agni’s disappearance and recovery  by the gods. After verse 1 it switches to the 2nd person and present/future time, with  standard praise of Agni and prayers for benefits from him.
