The relative clause of b, yá īm bhávanti ājáyaḥ, is very peculiar. There is no possible referent for the yé in either the preceding or the following main clause, and in addition the īm lacks function. It seems like a mangled paraphrase of I.81.3 yád udī́rata ājáyaḥ “when (battle-)drives arise/happen,” but what caused the mangling is unclear to me. The yé can be by “attraction” to the m. nom. pl. ājáyaḥ from putative *yád, and this set of Indra hymns has several examples of functionless īm (VII.20.3, 21.1). But it still lacks motivation.

The VP nā́ma bhikṣate “desires a share in your name” is striking and a little puzzling. The same phrase nā́ma √bhaj is found in V.57.5, but there it means that the Maruts, the subjects of the verb, all share the same name. Here, by contrast, it must be a clever way of saying that everyone calls Indra’s name, a novel paraphrase of the common epithet of Indra puruhūtá- ‘called upon by many’, found in this verse and vss. 20 and 26. (The English slang equivalent would be “wants a piece of you.”) Ge renders nā́ma bhikṣate as “Deinen Namen fleht … an” (implores), robbing the expression of its vividness.
