As Ge notes, práti inoti is not otherwise attested, and so its sense here is unclear (Ge “der sich an das Gebot hält,” Re “qui … va au-devant de l’ordonnance,” WG “der … das Gebot entgegensendet”). I prefer to read the práti as adverbial ‘in turn’, not as a preverb, and ínvati in its usual transitive sense ‘drive, advance [smtg]’.

See I.55.4.

On the apparent fem. dā́nu- ‘drop/gift’ see comm. ad I.32.9.
