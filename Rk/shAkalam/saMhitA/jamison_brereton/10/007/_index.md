Agni  
Trita Āptya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
This last of the Trita Āptya hymns is not particularly noteworthy, though it shows  some affinities with hymns earlier in the Trita Āptya sequence. Verses 5–6 point to  Agni’s role as “seasonal sacrificer” (r̥tv-íj), a role explored in X.2. Agni’s supreme  competence as a sacrificer is contrasted with the potential incompetence of the  mortal sacrificer in verse 4, as in X.2.5. Otherwise the hymn seems primarily con  
cerned with the material gain that will come to the mortal sacrificer for his ritual  efforts (see esp. vss. 1d, 2, 4, and 7).
