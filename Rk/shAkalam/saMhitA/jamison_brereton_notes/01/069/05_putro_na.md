The phrase víśo ví tārīt is variously interpreted. The first issue it raises is whether to take the acc. víśaḥ as direct object (so Ge, Re, WG) or to construe it with the preverb ví as acc. of extent of space (Old SBE). Both usages are attested for ví √tṝ, but it is worth noting that the latter usage is found in Parāśara’s oeuvre using the same form ví tārīt (I.73.1), and I adopt it here. In the simile, “traverse the clans” may refer to the year-long journey of the horse ultimately sacrificed in the Aśvamedha. In the frame it reflects the idea of the Vaiśvānara fire spread through all the clans, not limited to a single household or small family group.
