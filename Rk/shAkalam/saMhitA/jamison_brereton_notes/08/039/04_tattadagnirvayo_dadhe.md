Ge supplies a different subject (“singer”) for kṛpaṇyáti in the rel. clause than for dadhe in the preceding main clause: “so viel Kraft verlieht Agni wie immer (der Sänger) bedarf.” This is novel, but seems unnecessary and supported neither by context nor by parallels.

The Pp. analyzes ūrjā́hutiḥ as ūrjā́ā́hutiḥ, that is, probably with an instr. 1st member, but Old prefers to see the 1st member as a stem form, either ūrjā́- or ūrjá-.

The latter is marginally attested in cmpds and in the verb stem ūrjáya-, probably originally a denom. (see Jamison, -áya-, 50, 81). By Ge’s interpr. (which I follow), gen. pl. vásūnām limits the first member of this cmpd ūrjā́huti-. This is common in later Sanskrit, but somewhat rarer in the RV. Re (and Klein) render it backwards (Klein, DGRV I.205-6 “whose nourishment is the oblation of the gods”), but still with the gen. pl. limiting only one of the members. It may not be sufficiently clear in the publ. tr. that I take the cmpd as a bahuvrīhi.

Note that both -ā́huti- (√hu ‘pour’) and -hūti- (√hū ‘call’) appear in this vs. ### 05
The standard interpr. take pratīvyàm as the obj. of inóti (e.g., Ge “er befördert die Darbringung”), and this is certainly the simplest way. But inóti means ‘impel’, and práti √vī refers to the gods’ reception of mortals’ offerings, not the offerings themselves (see the root noun in quasi-infinitival usage in VIII.23.1, 26.8, and finite passages like VIII.101.10), so the simpler syntax requires attenuating the meanings of both words. I therefore complicate the surface syntax somewhat by supply an obj. to inóti extracted from dákṣiṇābhiḥ in pāda c and making pratīvyàm the goal. If the infinitival sense of pratīvyàm in its other two occurrences is maintained here, it could be tr. “impels (them) to be received.”
