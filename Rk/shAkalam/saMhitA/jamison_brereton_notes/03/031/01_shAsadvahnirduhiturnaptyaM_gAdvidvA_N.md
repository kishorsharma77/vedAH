The female line of descent implied in the 1st pāda, duhitúr naptyàm “the (grand)daughter of the daughter,” is striking. As noted already, I believe that this kinship succession refers to the production of the offering fire (Āhavanīya) from the householder’s fire (Gārhapatya) and the removal to the east of the former. Obviously, however, this can’t refer directly to the fires, because agní- is masc.; it is rather, I think, a reference to the hearths, which word (dhiṣánā- in some uses) is fem. The conveyor (váhniḥ) who has come (gāt) is the fire itself (often called váhni-), which has made the journey from the Gārhapatya hearth to the Āhavanīya hearth. The offering is being made there by the father (pitā́), whom I take as the priest. I do not see allusion to the cosmic incest of Heaven and his daughter, in part because it is difficult to identify who the granddaughter would be. (See Old.) The ritual identifications of váhni- = Agni and pitā́= priest are pretty standard; it is the identity of the females that causes dispute.
