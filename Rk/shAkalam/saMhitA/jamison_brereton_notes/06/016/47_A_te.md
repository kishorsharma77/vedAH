Bloomfield (ad V.6.5) proposes tr. our passage “We bring ... oblation with song fashioned in the mind,” suggesting that “the cases of ṛcā́and havíḥ are inverted.” This is certainly true at the level of deep-structure formula: hṛdā́taṣṭá- “fashioned by the heart” normally modifies a verbal product, e.g. I.171.2 stómo hṛdā́taṣṭáḥ. But, as so often, the poet is playing with our expections by producing a twist on the standard phraseology.
