The first mention of any divine being but the Sun. The question here is whether we have two additional gods or one. The two vocatives pāvaka and varuṇa are in two different pādas (a, c), and the former is almost exclusively used elsewhere of Agni. However, already in the hymn (vs. 1) another standard epithet of Agni, jātávedas-, has been applied to a different god (Sūrya), and so it may be that aspects of Agni, an alter ego of the Sun in some sense, are being distributed to other gods in this hymn. Moreover, the sun is regularly considered Varuṇa’s eye, but not, I think, Agni’s. Re, however, takes pāvaka as Agni.

The other question is the identity of the “bustling one” (bhuraṇyánt-). The root √bhur and its derivatives are sometimes used of Agni and this referent is possible here, but I think it more likely that it refers to the human ritualist, who is active at the dawn sacrifice.
