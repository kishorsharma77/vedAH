The verb ví … aśyuḥ should be read with both pādas, but, in my opinion, with slightly different senses. In pāda a pṛ́kṣaḥ is a straight acc. object to the lexeme in the meaning ‘reach, attain’; in pāda b víśvam ā́yuḥ may be one too (“attain a whole lifetime”) as most take it, but it may also be an acc. of extent of time (“reach through a whole lifetime”). The meaning is almost the same, but it would be like Parāśara to put the constructions slightly off-balance, and the compound viśvā́yuḥ is something of a signature word for Parāśara (see the immediately preceding vs. 4d, plus I.67.6, 10, 68.5) as an adverb expressing extent of time (“lifelong,” etc.). Note the phonetic echoes, pāda a: ví … aśyur, b: ví … ā́yuḥ; the first of these distracted sequences also evokes viśvā́yuḥ.

Pāda c sanéma … aryó is reminiscent of I.70.1a vanéma … aryó … The phrase bhāgáṃ devéṣu … dádhānāḥ is almost a paraphrase of I.68.4a bhájanta … devatvám. I would therefore change the publ. tr. “a portion among the gods” to “a share in the gods.”
