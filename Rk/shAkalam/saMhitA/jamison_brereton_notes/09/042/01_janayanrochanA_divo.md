Like the 1st vs. of the last hymn, also by Medhyātithi Kāṇva, this vs. is syntactically incomplete -- unless we want to take the pres. participles (janáyan a, b; vásānaḥ c) as predicated, which in this case I don’t. In this case, vs. 2 can easily pick up the participial vs. 1 and provide a predicate.
