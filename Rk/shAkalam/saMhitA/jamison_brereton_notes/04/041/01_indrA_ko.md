I am unhappy with the preterital value (‘has obtained’) universally assigned (incl. Kü 115) to āpa in pāda a, because it ill-fits the subj. paspárśat ‘will touch’ in d.

My ‘will obtain’ is a wishful thinking, however, at odds with the grammar. I would emend to ‘obtains’, with a presential value that Kü (116) allows for some passages.
