The apparent PN Pārāvata (‘who comes from afar’) apparently naming the patron makes sense as a speaking name in this hymn, which emphasizes the coming here of Indra from distant places and allows the identification of patron and Indra.

Note that the last word of the hymn is ā́, as it was the first (and it opens twelve of the hymn’s verses).
