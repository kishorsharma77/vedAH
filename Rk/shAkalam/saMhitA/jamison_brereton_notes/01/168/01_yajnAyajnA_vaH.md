Ge takes b as parenthetical. Although I agree that the 1st sg. subject of cd is also the subj. of pāda a, I think it less awkward to take pāda a as a nominal sentence, given the sheer amount of material that intervenes between it and the verb in d, vavṛtyām.

tuturváṇi- is a hapax, but it can hardly be anything but a pleonastically redupl.

form of turváṇi- (8x)(though it should be admitted that this latter stem is used only of gods). The redupl. form is sometimes credited with a desiderative sense (‘zu erlangen strebend’ versus turváṇi- ‘siegreich’, etc.: Gr; ‘zu gewinnen strebend’ versus turváṇi- ‘überwältigend’: AiG II.2.906, reproduced in EWA s.v. TŪRV; ‘cherche à l’emporter’: Re), but I see no contextual or morphological justification for this.

WG’s iterative/repetitive “immer wieder überwältigend” is probably closer to the mark, and it would fit with the repetitive ritual actions indicated by the āmreḍitas yajñā́-yajñā and dhíyam-dhiyam. I would be inclined to emend the publ. tr. to “(am I) ever victorious” or “continually victorious.” I do not understand Ge’s ‘zuvorkommend’.

The position of u in b is somewhat surprising. Klein (DGRV II.10 n. 16) groups it with a set of passages in which u appears as the penultimate word (or “word”) in its pāda after -ā and classifies it here as “expletive,” whatever that is meant to convey. Closest in configuration is VII.68.4 … devayā́u ádriḥ#.

The standard (and I think correct) interpr. of devayā́(ḥ) here is that it is fem.

pl., agreeing with the implicit plurality of the (sg.) āmreḍita dhíyaṃ-dhiyam -- an interesting syntactic constructio ad sensum.
