The tr. “prepare” for abhí śrīṇanti in b does not harmonize well with the simile vásubhir ná niktaíḥ “as if with freshly washed goods.” Nor does the interpr.

put forth by Narten (“Ved. śrīṇā́ti …,” KZ 100 [1987] = KlSch 340ff., at 349), “vollkommen machen” (complete, perfect). The developed sense of the root noun śrī́- ‘excellence, splendour, beauty’ and esp. the rt. noun cmpd abhiśrī́- ‘excelling in splendour’ (etc.) seems to have affected the meaning of the verb, and I would now tr.

something like “they beautify his head …,” which is not far from ‘bring to perfection’.
