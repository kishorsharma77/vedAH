Again elliptical. In ab the semantic opposition between new and old is obviously the point, but what new thing are we begging Indra for? Ge supplies “deed” (“… eine (Tat), die auch dem Älteste neu ist”). In III.31.19 the same expression návyam … sányase refers to the making of a new hymn, but it makes no sense to beg Indra for a new hymn. I tentatively supply ā́yuḥ ‘life’, which occurs several times with návyam (I.10.11, III.53.16, VII.80.2). The other occurrence of návyaṃ sanyasé (VIII.67.18) is found immediately after a periphrastic causative “you make live” (VIII.67.17c dévāḥ kṛṇuthá jīváse), and a “new life” works reasonably well in that passage. But this is all circumstantial, and I do not know why such a wish would be expressed here, beyond the usual Vedic desire to live a full and vigorous lifetime.

The sá tvám in c does not conform to the rules for 2nd ps. sá reference developed in Jamison 1992. I would therefore prefer to supply an imperative “(be) victorious …,” which would, I think, also fit the context better. However, the offending sá might be explained by the 3rd ps. verb (mucát) in the following verse (27ab), whose relative clauses hang off 26c, in my view. In other words, the construction of the whole sentence fluctuates between 2nd and 3rd ps. subject.
