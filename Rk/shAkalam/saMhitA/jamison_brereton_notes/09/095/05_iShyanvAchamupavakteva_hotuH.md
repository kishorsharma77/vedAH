The Upavaktar priest prompts the Hotar to speak. On this priestly title and its relationship to the Maitrāvaruṇa priest, see Minkowski, Priesthood in Ancient India, 118-27. It may be no accident that this priestly title, found only 3x in the RV (IV.9.5, VI.71.5, and here), occurs directly after a mention of Varuṇa.
