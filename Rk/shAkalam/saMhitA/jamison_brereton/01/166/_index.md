Maruts  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 14–15  
Many of the usual Marut themes are present in this hymn: the awesome and ter rifying power of the thunderstorm (vss. 4–6), their glittering bedecked bodies and  chariots (vss. 9–11), their aid to pious men (vss. 2–3, 7–8), their role as singers for  their comrade Indra (vss. 7, 11). Although the order of elements seems somewhat  random, these praises are set within a tight frame. Verse 1 begins “we shall proclaim  their greatness,” which is echoed exactly by verse 12 “this is your greatness”: the promised proclamation has reached its end. Verse 13 is similarly structured, begin ning “this is your kinship...,” and the final verse (14) before the refrain sets forth  what the poet wishes from the Maruts.  
Punctuating the hymn is an awareness of the balance between their past glories  and benevolence and the ones of the present day (see esp. vss. 1, 8, 13), and the  model of their previous generosity to sacrificers is given embodiment in verse 13,  where Manu’s offering of poetry induces the Maruts to appear to him with their  favors.
