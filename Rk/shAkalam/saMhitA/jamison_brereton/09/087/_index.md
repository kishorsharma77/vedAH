Soma Pavamāna  
Uśanas Kāvya  
9 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn, attributed to Uśanas Kāvya (perhaps because of the mention of that  figure in vs. 3), is built in part of standard soma-hymn tropes, but the militant  

Soma is particularly on view (vss. 2, 7), as well as his association with Indra (vss.  4, 8, 9). There are also the faintest sketches of Soma’s participation in well-known  myths: the Vala myth (vs. 3cd, where Soma is credited with finding the cows), the  falcon’s stealing of soma from heaven (vs. 6c), and the dog Saramā’s role in the  recovery of the cows in the Vala myth (vs. 8ab).  
This last example neatly shows the integration of ritual and mythic themes. The  first half of the verse, which alludes to the myth, does not identify the grammati cal subject by name or attribute, but does use a pronoun to mark it as female. This  might seem to exclude Soma as the referent—until we reach the final word of the  verse: dhā́rā “stream,” a feminine noun regularly used of the “stream of soma,”  which does allow the identification. From the mythological point of view, the dog  Saramā comes out of the mountain and finds the cows in the cave; in ritual terms  the (feminine) stream of soma comes out of the pressing apparatus and mixes with  the cows’ milk in the vessel. And this superimposition of ritual upon myth allows  Soma, indirectly, to be identified as the rescuer of the cows himself, as in verse 3.
