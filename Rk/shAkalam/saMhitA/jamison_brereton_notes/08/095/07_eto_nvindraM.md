Instead of HvN’s restoration nu índram (for nv índram), nú should of course be accented.

VIII.95.7-8: These two vss. contain successive occurrences of the pf. act. impv. built to √mad: 3rd sg. mamattu (7d), 2nd sg. mamaddhi (8d). Despite their apparently parallel formation, they have distinct transitivity values: the 3rd sg. is transitive, the 2nd sg. not. This difference is consistent in the usage of the two forms: the other instance of mamaddhí (X.96.13) is also intransitive, the 10 of the other 11 occurrences of mamáttu are transitive (save for late X.59.2) The difference may have arisen from the fact that, while mamáttu is a properly formed impv. to the pf. of √mad with expected full grade of the root syllable, in the 2nd sg. we should expect zero grade, hence *ma-md-dhí, which would probably simplify to *mandhí, with the superficially unredupl. weak perfect stem mand-, which is reinterpreted as a secondary root. Hence mamaddhí must be secondarily formed. I do not understand why this would affect its valency, though.
