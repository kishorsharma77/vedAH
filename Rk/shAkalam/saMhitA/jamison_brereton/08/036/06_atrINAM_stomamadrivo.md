Make the praise of the Atris great, o you of the (pressing) stone.
– O you of a hundred resolves, for exhilaration drink the soma that they  fixed as your portion—
you winning all battles, (winning) the broad expanse, entirely victorious  amid the waters, accompanied by the Maruts, o Indra, master of
settlements.
