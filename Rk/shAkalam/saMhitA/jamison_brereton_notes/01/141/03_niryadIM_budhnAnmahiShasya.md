This verse describes several mystical and, probably, mythical productions of fire, couched in the present (clear pres. mathāyáti in d, which suggests that the injunc.

kránta in b has the same temporal value). I do not completely understand either of the scenarios, esp. fire’s hiding in the mixing vessel in cd.

Ge’s suggestion that the first hemistich deals with Agni in the waters is supported by the parallel passages he adduces, and so it may continue the theme of 2b.

In d mathāyáti is entirely ambiguous between ‘churns, rubs’ (Old [SBE] ‘produces … by attrition’, Ge ‘ausreibt’) and ‘steals’ (Re, WG), and both are appropriate: ‘churns’ would continue the theme of fire-production, but ‘steals’ would refer to Mātariśvan’s theft of fire from heaven. No doubt both are meant, and there is both a mythical and a ritual application of the passage. Cf. I.148.1 máthīt … mātariśvā.
