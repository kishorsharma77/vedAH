42 (662)  
Varuṇa (1–3), the Aśvins (4–6)  
Arcanānas or Nābhāka Kāṇva  
6 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, anuṣṭubh 4–6  
This last hymn of the Nābhāka series is actually two hymns, on the grounds both  of meter and of subject matter, as Oldenberg clearly states (1888: 213 n. 2). The  first three verses, in triṣṭubh, are dedicated to Varuṇa. They continue the solemn tone and the cosmic focus of the previous hymn to Varuṇa (VIII.41), but with none  of the complexities. The Aśvins are the target of the second three verses (4–6), in  a simple invitation to soma-drinking. The Nābhāka refrain is found only in this  second hymnlet.
