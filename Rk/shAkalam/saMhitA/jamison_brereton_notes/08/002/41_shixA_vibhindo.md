title = "41"

As noted in the intro., one unfortunate consequence of taking all of vs. 40 as a single subordinate clause is that the 2nd ps. referent in the subordinate clause of 40 is Indra, while in the main clause here it is Vibhindu, the poet’s patron. As I suggested in the intro., this may be a ploy to superimpose Indra’s divine generosity on the human patron by implicitly identifying them. Vs. 21 in the next hymn (VIII.3), also in the dānastuti, supports this hypothesis, since there Indra and the Maruts and the human patron Pakasthāma Kaurayāṇa serve as undifferentiated subjects of the verb ‘gave’ (dúḥ).
