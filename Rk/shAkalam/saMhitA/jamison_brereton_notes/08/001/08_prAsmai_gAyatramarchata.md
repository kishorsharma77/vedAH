The first hemistich reprises 7cd, with a close variant of 7d recast in the imperative (8a), and one of the vocatives of 7c made into a predicated nominative (8b). This compound (puraṃdaráḥ) is in turn transformed into an independent clause (with lexical variation) in 8d: bhinát púraḥ. This process is reminiscent of the play with synthetic and analytic means of expression in vs. 2.

The fem. pl. relative yā́bhiḥ has no possible antecedent anywhere in this verse or nearby verses. The only possible fem. pl. referent is the ‘fortresses’ implicit in puraṃdaráḥ, but this makes no sense. With Old and Ge I supply ‘songs’, suggested by pl. gāyatrā́in 7d, although not directly connected thereto, because gāyatrá- is neuter.

Hoffmann (1967: 237-38) takes bhinát as a parenthetical verse filler, with the injunctive expressing a characteristic of Indra, parallel to vajrī́. Although he is attempting to account for the fact that bhinát is injunctive and yā́sat is subjunctive (and perhaps for the fact that sitting on the barhis and splitting fortresses can’t be done at the same time), this explanation seems over-complex. bhinát is a rhyme form to yā́sat, and the expected subjunctive bhinádat would be a good candidate for haplology under these circumstances.
