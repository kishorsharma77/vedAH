The long vowel of urū́is puzzling. Since it appears in the simile urū́ná rā́dhaḥ, it should be neut. sg. urú, and acdg. to Gr and AiG III.145 (with reff.) it is, with metrical lengthening. By contrast, Lub identifies it as a nom. pl. Since the frame corresponding to this simile is neut. pl. sávanāni purū́ni, I also prefer neut. pl.; it may show attraction to the number of the frame: “the many pressings are broad like your bounty.” As Ge (n. 14d) cleverly points out, the waters, cows, and drops are the three ingredients of soma.
