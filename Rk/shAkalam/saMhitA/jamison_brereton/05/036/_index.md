Indra
Prabhūvasu Āṅgirasa
6 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 3
Like the preceding hymn, attributed to the same poet, this one keeps its focus on  Indra, but is less predictable in its phraseology. The first four verses deploy a series  of similes characterizing Indra, the soma, and the singer(s). Verse 5 plays heav ily with the word “bull” (vŕ̥ṣan) for Indra and his accoutrements, a device that  returns more insistently in the first four verses of V.40. The final verse (6) is a short  dānastuti to the patron Śrutaratha (“[Having a] Famous Chariot”), whose name  may have inspired the wheel and chariot imagery of verse 3: the phrase “from the  chariot” in that verse is somewhat puzzling on the surface, but if it slyly expresses  the hope that the singer will become one “possessing many goods from (Famous)  Chariot,” it may be a prefiguring of the dānastuti.
