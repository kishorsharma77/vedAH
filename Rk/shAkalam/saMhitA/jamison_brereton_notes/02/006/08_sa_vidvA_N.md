The undoubted subjunctive (ā́) piprayaḥ seems to anchor the following yakṣi and (ā́) satsi as the haplologized s-aor. subjunctives they originally were, rather than in their later imperative function, esp. given the coordination of the first and last terms by ca … ca. However, the two ca’s could be more or less independent, with the second one conjoining yakṣi and satsi more closely.
