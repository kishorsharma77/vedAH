Note the echoes at the beginning and end of the first pāda: áyāmi … (dev)ájāmi(r). As often, the local patterns created by the use of hapaxes (as devájāmiis in the RV) may help account for their deployment.

I don’t understand Ge’s rendering of pāda b, where he seems to take singular ghóṣa(ḥ) of pāda a as the implied subject of plural irajyánta. I take the verb as a contrastive passive/reflexive to the otherwise active stem, more or less following Old’s interpretation, with śurúdhaḥ as subject.

The root noun cmpd vívāc- echoes the redupl. pres. vivakmi in the preceding hymn, VII.22.5, though of course the vi’s have nothing to do with each, being the preverb and the reduplicating syllable respectively.
