The lexeme ánu √kruś is later a semi-technical term for raising the hue-andcry, which would be appropriate in this context.

There is a phonological echo of 4c nicíkyat in 5c nīcā́yamānam, although the latter is to be analyzed as nīcā́+áyamānam. The latter belongs to the marginal thematized pres. áyate to √i (see Gotō, 1st Kl., 92-97). There is one other occurrence of this medial part. in the RV, otherwise a few finite forms, some of which are ambiguous between subjunctive to the root pres. and indicative to a them. pres.
