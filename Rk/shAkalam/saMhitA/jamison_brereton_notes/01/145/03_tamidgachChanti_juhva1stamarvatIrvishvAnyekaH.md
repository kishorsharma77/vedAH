The identity of the ‘mares’ (árvatīḥ) is unclear; it should simply be a ritually related entity of fem. gender used in the plural, which leaves the field pretty wide open (hymns, prayers, ghee streams, etc.). It is unlikely to be the ladles (juhvàḥ) though they are feminine and plural, because the tám … tám construction invites two different subjects, like the tásmin … tásmin constr. in 1c.

Apropos of -praiṣa in c, Ge (fld by WG) claims that this does not refer to the technical ritual sense of praiṣa- found in the later ritual. I would disagree. The word clearly is meant to mean something different from praśíṣ-, also ‘command’ (though to a different root entirely), in 1c, and this verse (3) is quite ritual-centric. See further at I.180.6
