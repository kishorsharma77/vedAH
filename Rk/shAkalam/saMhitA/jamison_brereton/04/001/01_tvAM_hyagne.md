You, o Agni, the god, did the gods of equal fervor install for always as  the spoked wheel (of the sacrifice)—  
with such a purpose did they install you:  
[Gods addressing mortals:] “Sacrifice to the immortal [=Agni] among  the mortals; beget the god god-directed and discerning;  
beget each one [=every new fire] as god-directed and discerning.”
