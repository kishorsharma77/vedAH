Today, o gods, at the rising of the Sun, deliver us from distress and from  disgrace.
– This let Mitra and Varuıa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa, the son of Dīrghatamas (poet of I.140–164), is the poet  of the next eleven hymns (116–126). As Geldner points out, however, Kakṣīvant  refers to himself as pajriyá (I.116.7, 117.6, 120.5) and to his family as the pajrā́ḥ (I.122.8, 126. 4, 5). According to I.121.13 the Pajras are Aṅgirases. Kakṣīvant also

calls himself the son of Uśij in I.119.9 and 122.4; Sāyaṇa identifies Uśij as a dāsī, a  servant woman.
Whatever his family affiliations Kakṣīvant has one of the most distinctive poetic  personalities in the R̥gveda. He is a very skillful, self-conscious, and tricky artist,  setting traps for his unwary hearers and twisting words and phrases into often  impenetrable knots, with an exuberance that we have to admire despite our fre
quent frustrations. He also has clear thematic preoccupations. Approximately half  of his oeuvre is devoted to the Aśvins (116–120), with important catalogues of their  deeds and services. (Much of what we know or surmise about the mythology of  the Aśvins comes from these hymns.) He is also particularly interested in women in  all their aspects: there are important and high-style treatments of the marriage of  Sūryā and the Aśvins’ wooing of her, as well as two lovely Dawn hymns (123–124)  sketching a range of female roles, but there is also a nearly obscene celebration of  a girl he received as a gift from his patron (126.6–7) that presses the boundaries of  R̥gvedic decorum.
Because so much of Kakṣīvant’s artistry is bound up with his manipulation of  the Sanskrit language even at the phonological level, the special flavor of his poetry  is particularly hard to convey in translation, unfortunately.
