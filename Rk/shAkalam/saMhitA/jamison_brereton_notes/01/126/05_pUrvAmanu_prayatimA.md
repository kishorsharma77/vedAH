Having employed a no-nonsense style in listing the gifts he acquired in vss.

2-4 (for a similar detour into straightforwardness, see the expression of his desires in I.121.14-15), Kakṣīvant returns to his tricks in the last vss. of this hymn.

Since I discuss this verses at length in Jamison 2003 (Fs. H.-P. Schmidt) pp.

47-51, I will not repeat the details here. The first hemistich is reasonably intelligible and continues the listing of gifts. It’s notable that the amount that Kakṣīvant managed to acquire “for you” (vaḥ) is a small fraction of his own haul. One question is who the “you” are: I take them as the Pajras, his kin, who cleaned up with him in 4d and are mentioned again in 5d, though in the 3rd ps.

As I point out in the loc. cit., the elaborate simile in cd seems typed as a wedding scene by the telling words ánasvant- ‘possessing carts’ and vrā́- ‘female chooser’. The cart (ánas-) is the wedding vehicle par excellence and hardly appears in the RV except in conjunction with females, particularly in marriage context, and, as I argue in that art., vrā́- is the designation for a girl exercising her choice at a svayaṃvara marriage. The image presented in the simile is of well-connected young men traveling to svayaṃvaras in hopes of acquiring a bride (that is, being chosen by a bride) of acceptable family and clan. I therefore take the vrā́ḥ phrase as acc. pl., not nom. with most interpr. and take the simile as beginning with subándhavaḥ.
