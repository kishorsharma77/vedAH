As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. marks a departure from the first two conventional vss., with richer imagery, esp. in the first pāda. The first hemistich must refer to the soma plant, growing in the mountains. The god of the thunder(storm), Parjanya is his father because rain produces plants. The qualifier parṇín- means, in the first instance, ‘feathered’ (e.g., VIII.5.33 váyaḥ … parṇínaḥ “feathered birds”), but of course parṇá- ‘feather’ has already undergone widening in the RV to mean ‘leaf’ as well, and so it must be interpr. here.

The scene shifts back to the ritual ground in cd: the two additional ingredients of prepared soma, water and milk, are found in c, with the pressing stones in d (the actual order of ritual preparation would be the reverse, of course).

In c utá is in an unusual position and its function is unclear. Klein (DGRV I.380-81) simply describes the situation as involving “nonparallel clauses and weak nexus,” remarking further that cd “bears little cohesive relationship to ab,” though that’s what he thinks utá is connecting. Ge and Re both tr. as “also,” and the publ. tr.

follows this interpr., which seems more likely than Klein’s near-null hypothesis.

Perhaps contributing to its unusual position is the parallelism of abhí gā́utā́saran# and 1b abhí gā́acikradat#, with the verbs trisyllabic asaran and quadrisyllabic acikradat respectively. The utá supplies the necessary extra syllable and, by coalescing with the augment, the heavy antepenult needed for the cadence.

In d “unite with the stones” may be a little strong: better “come together with.”
