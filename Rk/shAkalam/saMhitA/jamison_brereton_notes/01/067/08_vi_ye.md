The verb ví … cṛntánti lacks an overt object, and several different ones have been proposed: Ge (in n.) suggests it’s “the stream of truth” from 7d; Re supplies “(l’énigme)”; and WG read ṛtā́with this verb as well as the participle sápantaḥ (“welche … die Ṛtas aufknoten, (sie) pflegend”). Since the other two occurrences of this root (impv. ví … cṛta I.25.21, ppl. vícṛtta-) are both construed with pā́śa- ‘fetter’, that seems the likely object here as well. More speculatively, on the basis of VII.59.8 druháḥ pā́śān ‘fetters of deceit’, I have supplied that whole phrase here, since ‘deceit’ contrasts nicely with the emphasis on ṛtá- ‘truth’.

The pf. prá vavāca is one of the very few pf. forms to √vac with full reduplication (against uvā́ca, etc.). On the basis of its agreement with Aves. vauuac-, Kü (p. 441) considers this the older type of reduplication, with the newer type spreading from Samprasāraṇa roots.
