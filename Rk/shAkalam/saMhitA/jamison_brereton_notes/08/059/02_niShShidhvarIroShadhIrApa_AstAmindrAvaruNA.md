The Khila ābhyām should be read for āstām.

pāré can be read with both genitives, rájasaḥ and ádhvanaḥ, separately (so also Ge) and is positioned between them.

Despite the morphological peculiarity of sísratuḥ (on which see Old, Narten [see Kü’s ref.], Kü 553), I see no reason to substitute the Khila tasthátuḥ with Old, Ge. Both Narten and Kü endorse the nonce form sísratuḥ.
