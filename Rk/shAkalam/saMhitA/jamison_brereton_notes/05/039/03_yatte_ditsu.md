I take ab as nominal rel. clause with a predicated grdv. prarā́dhyam, while Ge (/WG) simply take it as a nom. cl. (“what is your thought…”). My tr. should be modified slightly to make it clear that the ásti is accented: “Which thought of yours, famed and lofty, eager to give, is to [/should] be realized, with it …” In cd both Ge and WG separate the two pādas and supply a second verb (or, as far as I can tell, a 2nd exemplar of the overt verb ā́darṣi in different usage). I interpr. ā́darṣi as taking a double acc. in a condensed expression: “split X for (its contents) Y.” The lexeme ā́√dṛ can take as obj. either the container or the contained; for a similar double acc. with both see III.30.21 ā́no gotrā́dardṛhi … gā́ḥ “Split open the cowpens for the cows.”
