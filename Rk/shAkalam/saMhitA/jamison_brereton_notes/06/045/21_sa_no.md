Ge takes niyúdbhiḥ and vā́jebhiḥ as parallel, and therefore the ‘teams’ are among the things with which Indra fulfills our desire. Given the position of niyúdbhiḥ in the 1st pāda and its usual usage, I think it rather refers to Indra’s teams, with which he travels ‘here’, and I take ā́both with pṛṇa and with a verb of motion to be supplied. For a similar use, see VI.22.11 sá no niyúdbhiḥ … ā́gahi …, also addressed to Indra in this cycle.
