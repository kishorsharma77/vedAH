As noted in the publ. intro., with the Anukramaṇī and Sāyaṇa as well as Thieme, I take Agastya as the speaker of this vs., contra the standard modern assignment to Lopāmudrā (Ge, Re, Doniger, WG). The question is of some importance, because it determines the identity of the “me” whom desire has overcome. I see the verse as expressing Agastya’s sudden surrender to his own latent and then aroused sexual desire; others must see Lopāmudrā as continuing to assert her desire as in vss. 1-2 to the chaste Agastya. But in that case I don’t see how the sex would have taken place, since Agastya was unwaveringly against it in vs. 3.

Certainly assigning it to Agastya makes for a more psychologically complex portrait.

Crucial to the interpr. that assigns the verse to Lopāmudrā is the syntactic function of the gen. phrase nádasya … rudhatáḥ and the meaning of the part.

rudhánt-. In the Lopāmudrā-speaker view the genitive is an objective genitive: “lust for the náda- rudhánt- has come to me [=Lopāmudrā].” The participle then belongs to √rudh ‘obstruct’ and refers either to Agastya’s ascetic self-control by withholding his semen (Ge flg. Sāy, Doniger) or to his warding off the importunate advances of his wife (WG). In the Agastya-speaker view the genitive is subjective and the participle belongs to √rudh ‘grow, mount’. Although Re claims that ‘grow’ is “faiblement attesté” for rudh, “feebly” isn’t “not,” and in any case the attestation is more robust than Re seems to recognize. With the ‘grow, mount’ meaning, nádasya … rudhatáḥ is a pun: the mounting bull (nadá-) and the growing reed (likewise nadá-), with the latter a metaphor for the penis. For a somewhat indecisive disc. of the possible meanings of the phrase see Old.
