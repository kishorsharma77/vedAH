Rudra (1–2, 4–6), Rudra, Mitra and Varuṇa (3), Soma (7–9)  
Kaṇva Ghaura  
9 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 9, arranged in tr̥cas  
There is only one other R̥gvedic hymn dedicated jointly to Rudra and Soma, gods  who have little apparent in common. In VI.74 the two are invoked together, in a dual  dvandva, but aside from generic divine descriptions only Rudra’s characteristics are  mentioned. Here the two gods are confined to separate tr̥cas; in fact, as Oldenberg  suggests, it may have originally been two hymns: verses 1–6 Rudra, 7–9 Soma.  
In contrast to other Rudra contexts the depiction of Rudra here is resolutely posi tive; there is no trace of the dangerous or vengeful Rudra. One might in fact consider  the pile-up of flattering adjectives in the opening question in verse 1 a poetic insur ance policy, making it clear to the god that there will be no caviling from us. The rest  of the two Rudra tr̥cas focuses on the god’s power to provide for the welfare of both  humans and livestock, along with Aditi (vs. 2) and the principal Ādityas (vs. 3).  
The first two verses (7–8) of the tr̥ca to Soma are straightforward and generic,  with no particularly somian features. The final verse (9), in a different meter, is syn tactically complex and lexically formal, and has given rise to a number of compet ing interpretations. In our view it depicts Soma, as often, as extending from earth to  heaven, and he finds the gods in both places, in heaven, which is their abode, and on  the ritual ground, because they have come to drink soma at the sacrifice. Both the  relevance of this verse to the rest of the tr̥ca and the connection of the Rudra and  Soma portions of the hymn escape us.
