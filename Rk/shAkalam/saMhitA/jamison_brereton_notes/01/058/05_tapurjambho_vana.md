On sthātúḥ (in the pair sthātúś carátham “the still and the moving”) as neut.

sg. to the -tar-stem (< *-tṛ́) see AiG I.23, 301; III.204 and most recently Frotscher 2012. Tichy (1995: 71) rejects this explanation, but her alternative (a masc. nom. sg.

to a -tu-stem) breaks the tight rhetorical structure of this merism by pairing a masculine with a neuter (carátham). Thus, whatever phonological problems there may be in assuming an *-ṛ# > -ur# change (as opposed to *-ṛs > -ur as in the gen. sg.

of -ṛ-stems), I favor the older view. Frotscher’s suggestion that accented final -ṛ́ develops to -úr may help solve the problem. In any case the nom./acc. neut form here would also be reinforced by the semantically identical genitive sg. phrase sthāthúś ca ... (jágataś ca (I.159.3, II.31.5).
