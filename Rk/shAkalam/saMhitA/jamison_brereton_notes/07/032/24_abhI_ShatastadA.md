There are two word plays in this verse. The simpler one is between the impv. bhara ‘bring’ in pāda a and the āmreḍita bháre-bhare ‘at every raid’, where the noun bhára- has been specialized from ‘(an occasion for) bearing away’ to ‘raid’.

The more complex one involves the creation and disappointment of expectations. The verse begins with abhī́ṣatáḥ. The juxtaposition of these two forms 37 (the latter being the pres. part. to √as ‘be’ in either gen.-abl. sg. or acc. pl.) and their close sandhi, with retroflex initial ṣ, invites the audience to fill in the semantics of the lexeme abhí √as ‘be superior’. But to our surprise, at the end of this hemistich we find the semantic opposite, kánīyasaḥ ‘the lesser ones’, requiring us to revise our analysis of the opening, dissolving the presumed lexeme into the directional preverb/preposition abhí and the independent pres. participle modifying kánīyasaḥ much later in the line. For extensive discussion see Old.

I cannot follow Gr, Old in interpreting jyā́yaḥ as voc., but take it, with Ge, as neut. sg. with tád. Among other things, AiG III.296 notes only two masc. vocatives in -īyas in the RV, this one and ójīyaḥ in X.120.4, which is also better taken as a neut.
