Omen-Bird  
Gr̥tsamada  
3 verses: triṣṭubh  
The last two brief hymns in Maṇḍala II have a popular character and call on the  “omen bird” (śakúni / śakúnti) to produce only auspicious cries. The second of the  two (II.43) playfully compares the bird to various priests in the ritual and is thus  reminiscent of the famous “Frog Hymn” (VII.103), which identifies the behavior of  frogs in the monsoon with that of priests.
