The object phrase in the 1st hemistich provides an ex. of number disharmony (of a different type from that in vs. 13). The main objects of Indra’s smiting are “rivals (and) foes,” the pl. phrase śátrūn … amítrān, but they are further specified as “kin and non-kin,” jāmím ájāmim, in the singular. The same disharmony is found in IV.4.5 jāmím ájāmim … śátrūn, where the śátrūn that closes our pāda a substitutes for amítrān.
