A curious construction: √bhū + GEN., which seems to express partitive value: “become (part of) X” à “partake of,” though the path to partitive meaning is not straightforward. (Other translators seem to feel less guilt about making this leap than I do.) Closest to it formulaically is vidyā́ma + GEN, “might we know of X.” Cf. vidyā́ma sumatīnā́m (I.4.3, X.89.17) “might we know (of) your favors.” The oddity of the construction is exacerbated by the emphatic pāda-initial repetition (a, b) of indeclinable yuvā́ku ‘of you two’.
