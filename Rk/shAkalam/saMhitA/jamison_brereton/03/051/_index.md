Indra  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
12 verses: jagatī 1–3, triṣṭubh 4–9, gāyatrī 10–12, arranged in trcas ̥  
The hymn falls into four sets of tr̥cas, in three different meters. Since the hymn  follows one of five verses, each tr̥ca should originally have been a single hymn,  to conform to the normal patterns of arrangement within maṇḍalas. However,  even if it did consist originally of four separate hymns, the evidence of larger  ring composition discussed with regard to III.50 makes it likely that III.51 was  an addition to the original Indra collection, which would once have ended with  III.50.  
The first two tr̥cas consist of standard tropes of praise for Indra, with an empha sis on the songs and singers that express this praise. There are no strong indications  of unity within the tr̥cas. The third tr̥ca is devoted to Indra’s drinking of soma in  company with the Maruts and is thus appropriate to the Midday Pressing, like  several other Indra hymns in this maṇḍala (III.32, 35, 47, 50). The final tr̥ca is even  more insistently focused on Indra’s soma-drinking.
