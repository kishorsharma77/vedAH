On the construction with akṛṇoḥ see disc. ad vs. 1.

There is a slight syntactic clash between ablative víśvasmāt, appropriate to a comparative (“lower than all”), and the superlative adhamā́n, which should have a genitive (“lowest of all”).

The dual verbs of cd (ábādhethām ámṛṇatam … ávindethām) must have Indra and Soma as subjects, as the larger context (vss. 1-2) and the explicit Vāyav Indraś ca construction in 5b show. But the immediate context (vs. 3) falsely suggests Indra and Agni on the basis of 3a.
