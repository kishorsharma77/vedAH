Flg. Ge, I take svastí sarvadhā́tamaḥ as if containing a dvandva svastisarva-. Ge convincingly cites other svastí √dhā passages. It might be possible to take it instead as a (short) instr.: “best establishing wholeness along with well-being,” though the status of svastí as an instr. seems shaky to me. Scar (264) takes it as an acc., with sarva- in the cmpd functioning as a predicative acc. to it: “der am besten das Glück vollständig macht.”
