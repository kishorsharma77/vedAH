Note the etymological and phonological figure śíkṣā śacīvaḥ śácībhiḥ. The desire to have a pāda consisting of only these related words may account for the absence of naḥ: śíkṣa- regularly takes a dative. Cf. the fuller expression in I.62.12 śíkṣā śacīvas táva naḥ śácībhiḥ. Of course naḥ can be easily supplied here from pāda a.
