The “one being at home” (amā́sánt-) may contrast implicitly with the “Early-coming” one (prātarítvan-) who forms the subject of the 1st half of the next hymn (I.125). In that hymn the Prātaritvan engages in dialogue with a person who is probably a householder, that is, in the words of our verse, one being at home.

This vs. is identical to VI.64.6; for further comm. see there.
