The two other occurrences of durmáda- ‘badly drunk’ (I.32.6, VIII.2.12) are both in martial context and seem to refer to warriors intoxicated on the frenzy of battle. The other occurrences are quite negative, whereas here we must take the word as positive or neutral in describing the Maruts, who are, to be sure, frequently depicted as being almost out of control. I think this is the point of comparison.
