Praise of Food (Annastuti)
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
11 verses: anuṣṭubgarbha 1, gāyatrī 2, 4, 8–10, anuṣṭubh 3, 5–7, anuṣṭubh or br̥hatī 11
On the surface a charming address to food, couched throughout in the 2nd per son, this hymn nonetheless enfolds some mysteries. In the straightforward verses  (esp. 1–3, 6), the poet praises food as the necessary support and help for both gods  and men, a theme summarized in the final verse (11).
But the nature of food and of its “juices” (rásāḥ) is also explored in several  obscure verses (esp.  4–5), where they have a cosmic dimension. In our view, the  juices of verse 4, “dispersed throughout the (cosmic) realms and adjoined to heaven  like the winds,” are the rains, localized in the midspace like the winds—and more  generally the endlessly circulating cosmic waters that fall as rain, produce food in

the form of plants and animals, and return to heaven by evaporation and by ritual  offering. In verse 5 these juices both yield food (as the nurturing rains) and are part  of, or belong to, food (as the juicy parts of plants and animals).
The hymn takes a ritual turn in the last four verses (7–10) before the summary  verse (11). Verse 7 seems to introduce the early-morning ritual; in the next three  verses (8–10), marked by a refrain, food is sacralized—made equivalent to soma  (vs. 9) and to a plant, perhaps the soma plant (vs. 10), each addressed as “friend of  the winds” (see vs. 4 for food’s association with the winds)—and transformed into  ritual offerings. The generic “waters and plants” of verse 8 become the milk and  grain mixed with soma in verse 9. (The exact application of vs. 10 is unfortunately  unclear.) In each case, the addressee is urged to “become just the fat,” in other  words (in a more robust society than ours) the choicest part of the food substance.
