apó vásānaḥ returns from 4b, 18c, along with the verb árṣa-, ubiquitous in this hymn.

gā́ḥ ‘cows’ needs to be read with both c and d. In the former it is the referent of the hapax mandánāḥ (whose sense is, however, easy to divine) and the obj. of the caus. redupl. aor. ‘causes to bellow’; in the latter it is the obj. of kṛṇvānáḥ and the target of the simile: “making the cows as if into his garment” (a simile that of course depends on a metaphor: cows = milk). I consider the ná to be displaced - we might expect *nirṇíjaṃ ná. This pāda, in this order, is also found in IX.14.5; for variants on the phrase without simile particle see IX.86.26, 95.1, all adduced by Ge (n. 26d).
