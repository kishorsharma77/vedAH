The pf. of √sad is generally intrans.(/reflex.) ‘sat (oneself) down’, but in several instances must be trans. ‘set down’, as it is here. See Kü 542-43.

There is no agreement on the meaning of the adj. sāmaná-, found in the RV only here and in the wedding hymn (X.85.11). Gr ‘gemeinschaftlich’ (fld. by WG), Ge ‘gütige (?)’, Re ‘abondante’ (but in EVP XVI, ad X.85.11, he suggests that in our passage it means ‘attelée-avec’ with which ‘heaven’ should be supplied), AiG II.2.136 ‘reich’. I suggest that it’s a vṛddhi deriv. of sámana- ‘gathering’, meaning ‘related to the gathering/aggregate’, hence ‘whole’. This does not work so well in X.85.11, but there there is a pun on -sā́man- ‘tune’, and the word seems simply to mean ‘together’ vel sim.
