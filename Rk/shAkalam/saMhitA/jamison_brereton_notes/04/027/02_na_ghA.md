There is general agreement that Soma speaks this and the following vss.

I read ápa twice in pāda a -- first with jabhāra ‘he carried away’, but also with jóṣam ‘against (my) will’ (despite Old’s rejection of the latter). This phrase would be constructed on the model of ánu jóṣam ‘following my will’. That it was not against Soma’s will is explained by the next pāda, where he boasts that he is stronger and braver than the falcon, implying that without Soma’s agreement the falcon could not have borne him away. The standard tr. take jóṣam positively -- so that in conjunction with the neg. ná the whole is negative: “he did not willingly carry me away.” In this reading it is the falcon’s will or pleasure that is at issue (e.g., WG “Nicht hat der mich ja zu (seinem) Gefallen fortgebracht”). I don’t understand what this would convey: that the falcon was forced on this mission by someone else? that once the falcon saw Soma, he didn’t want to take him? Thieme (Ged.) by contrast takes it as the guard’s will (“mit Zustimmung [des Wächters]”), but we would surely need more signaling than the bare noun jóṣam to indicate that the jóṣa- belongs to a character we haven’t met yet (presumably Kṛśānu of 3d). Moreover, it suggests, only to reject, a scenario involving a corrupt prison guard that seems to me out of place.

Pāda c is almost identical to 26.7, with the addition of the adv. īrmā́‘still, quiet’ (on which see comm. ad VIII.22.4). It qualifies the left-behind árātīḥ ‘hostilities’; cf. V.62.2 īrmā́tasthúṣīh ‘standing still’, with the adv. limiting a fem. pl.

participle. See Narten’s sim. tr. (Kl Sch. 69).

Since púraṃdhi- is fem., and the nom. sg. śū́śuvānaḥ in d is masc., Puraṃdhi cannot be the subject there -- rather the falcon, as the standard interpr. agree.
