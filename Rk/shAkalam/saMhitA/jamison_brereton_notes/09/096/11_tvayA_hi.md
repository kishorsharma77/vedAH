As Ge (see n. 11c) and Ober (I.311 with n. 791) point out, the first hemistich depicts the Vala myth, with “forefathers” (pitáraḥ) a reference to the Aṅgirases - made clearer by a similar but more explicit passage in the next hymn, IX.97.39. This mythic episode - the forefathers opening the Vala cave with the help of soma - provides the model for the appeal in c, for Soma to open the paridhí- (paridhī́m̐r áporṇu): paridhí- is used explicitly of the barriers of the Vala cave in I.52.5. But as Ge suggests (n. 11c), the poet here is calling on Soma to open up the livestock pens and provide us with the animals therein.
