The form śuṣmíṇa (in sandhi) can represent either śuṣmíne (dat. sg.) or śuṣmíṇaḥ (in turn, either gen.-abl. sg. or nom.-acc. pl.). (The Pp. reads -e.) Any of these possibilities is possible in context, and so it may well be that the ambiguity is meant. As a nom. pl. it could characterize the subj. (‘they’ = soma drinks), as Re.

takes it. As a gen. sg. it could refer to Indra, who is indeed regularly modified by this adj. As a dat. sg. it could modify mádāya (so Ge), or it might still refer to Indra, in well-known double dative construction of the type “for the tempestuous one for his exhilaration” à “to exhilarate the tempestuous one.” I favor an interpretation that attributes the word to Indra; among other things, this makes the unaccented asya in b easier to account for. Preferably genitive śuṣmíṇaḥ, though I have not been able to find a parallel expression.

On the surface, pāda a lacks a main verb, but it is possible that it is lurking there. The subordinator yád appears as yán in sandhi before a nasal. The otherwise unattested 3rd pl. injunctive of √i ‘go’ would have the same shape and is the expected verb in this idiom (cf., e.g., 3rd pl. impf. sám āyan X.27.8). I therefore suggest we have a notional haplology sáṃ *yád yán.

I do not understand the function of hí in b, which triggers accentuation of the main verb dadhé in c. I would at all costs prefer to avoid attributing pure emphatic function to hí, but this passage comes perilously close to that.
