Ge. suggests that jarante here can be ambiguous, belonging not only to ‘sing’, but also to ‘awaken’, with identical present stem. This is possible, but only with an intransitive sense of ‘awaken’: “the singers awaken / wake up to you,” since the ‘awaken’ present is only intrans. (see Gotō 1987: 150). In any case surely the primary sense is ‘sing’, given the the etymological figure produced by its grammatical subj. jaritā́raḥ ‘singers’.
