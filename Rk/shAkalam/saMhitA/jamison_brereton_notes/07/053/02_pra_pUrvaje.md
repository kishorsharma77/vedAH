Unusually, this vs. requests and depicts physical movement of Heaven and Earth, which is conceptually awkward, given that Heaven at least has a fixed position at a great distance from our ritual ground. I have argued elsewhere (“The Divine Revolution of Ṛgveda X.124: A New Interpretation. Beyond Asuras and Devas,” Staal Ged., 2016) that one of the likely reasons for the eclipse of the inherited divinity and original head of the pantheon Dyauṣ Pitar “Father Heaven” is his inability to move about the cosmos and esp., in conformity with the newer ritual model, to come to our sacrifice rather than having the oblations of that sacrifice filter up to heaven. This is one of the few passages in the RV where his presence at the sacrifice is urged, and only a little thought is required to reveal it as odd.

Ge takes sádane as du (“den beiden Sitzen der Wahrheit”), and in favor of this interpr. is the fact that its final vowel is pragṛhya in the Saṃhitā text (sádane ṛtásya, not *sádana ṛtásya, as in IV.42.4), as Old points out. However, I take it, with Re and Lü (607-8)(and Gr implicitly) as a loc. sg. in the usual phrase. As Lü points out (608), gods are never themselves “seats of truth” but are located in such seats.
