Because of the 2nd ps. reference of vs.-init. sá, which is only appropriate with imperatives, I take devápsarā asi as a parenthentical insertion, with sá to be construed with vs.-final bhava. This has the advantage of allowing naḥ in pāda a, which would have no function in ab, to be construed with gātuvíttamaḥ in c, where it most naturally belongs. See asmábhyam gātuvíttamaḥ in two nearby hymns
