This vs. is quite obscure, but seems metaphorically to depict the soma sacrifice. The problems are, as usual, conpounded by the fact that the two (or one?) principal actor(s) are not identified. Interpr. of the vs. differ, and I will not discuss them all in detail.

In the first hemistich I take the draft animal (váhniḥ … paśúḥ) to be soma, as often; the adj. dróṇya- ‘belonging to/seeking the dróṇa’ seems to clinch this, since dróṇa is always the soma cup. The action depicted is the standard flowing of the soma towards and into the soma vessels, regularly conceived as a (male) animal running (here √dru) to a goal. The verb dudrávat is a pf. subj.; as I have established elsewhere (García Ramón Fs.), pf. subjunctives are simply subjunctives in value, with a future (not a future perfect) sense.

I take the 2nd hemistich as the main clause construed with the dependent yátra clause in ab. Its predicate is the agent noun sánitā lit. ‘winner’. Because of the futurevalue subjunctive in the dep. clause, sánitā looks to me like a good prospect for a periphrastic future use of the agent noun (so, it seems, Ge; contra Tichy, 229: “Wo sich … beeilen wird, gewinnt …” [my italics]).

The subject in cd is, in my opinion, Indra. The adj. nṛmáṇas- ‘manly minded’ is used most often of him, and of course it is Indra for whom the soma is destined.

vīrá-pastya- is a hapax, but it seems a bahuvrīhi of the type vájra-bāhu- ‘having an arm with a mace in it’, hence ‘having a house with heroes in it’, presumably referring to both divine and mortal warriors that Indra can muster in battle -- his household.

The first two words in the last pāda, árṇā dhī́reva, are problematic, the 2nd more than the first. For árṇā we must assume a neuter substantivization (‘flood[s]’) of the adj. árṇa- ‘flooding, undulating’, here in the pl. Given its sandhi position it could in principle instead represent árṇās, a feminine substantivization; since árṇaseveral times modifies fem. áp- ‘waters’, this might work better -- but it makes it harder to explain the difficult dhī́rā, which is most easily taken also as a neut. pl.

These floods are surely the floods of soma that are racing in the first half-verse.

As just noted, the simile dhī́reva [= dhīrā / iva] is problematic. It is tempting to take it as dhī́raḥ with irregular sandhi (so Roth; see Old), but this is of course not a legitimate interpretational technique. It is also tempting to leave it untranslated, as Ge does. Sāy. takes it as a fem. nom. sg., but who would this wise woman be? Ge considers the possibility of an instr. sg., but not seriously enough to tr. it so.

Reluctantly, with a similarly reluctant Old, I take it as a neut. pl., meaning ‘wise (thoughts)’. This is unsatisfying because the adj. dhī́ra- otherwise only refers to animates. There are partial parallels for √san with thoughts/wisdom as obj., e.g., IX.9.9 sánā medhā́m, X.143.3 síṣāsataṃ dhíyaḥ, but not with dhī́ra-. A possibly more promising interpr. is suggested by Re, who points out that the only other neut. form of dhī́ra- is found with janū́ṃṣi ‘races’ in VII.86.1; this also seems to underlie Tichy’s “wie verständige (Wesen).” I would now emend the publ. tr. to “… like the wise (races).” This isn’t a great deal better, but it at least deals with the problem of animate/inanimate.
