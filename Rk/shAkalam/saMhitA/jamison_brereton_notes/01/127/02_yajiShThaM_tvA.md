Although “earth-encircling heaven” fits easily into our modern cosmology, I don’t know what is meant by this in a Vedic cosmological context. This problem clearly troubles both Ge and Re, who both supply the sun to do the circling, with heaven as the object (Re: “Lui qui circule autour (de l’aire) comme (le soleil autour du) ciel”). Although I understand the impetus, these interpr. introduce too much extra machinery into a simple two-word simile.

Agni was compared to a vípra- in 1c and then addressed as one in 2b. In 2c we invoke Agni with our own vípra-s, with víprebhiḥ occuping the same position as vípram in 1c. This type of implicit identification between Agni and his mortal worshipers is also found in 2a, where we sacrificers (yájamānāḥ) invoke him as best sacrificer (yájiṣṭham).

2f is a relative clause that lacks a verb; the verb ([pra-]ávanti vel sim.) can be supplied from the verb in the 8-syllable tag (2g), which contains the impv. prā́vantu with the same subj. (víśaḥ ‘clans’). The g-pāda also adds an infinitival dat. to this verbal complex, indicating what the clans help Indra to do. Constructing the verb in 2f from the one in 2g is not a matter of simple gapping, because imperatives cannot appear in relative clauses. Ge supplies a different verb in f (huldigen) from that in g (ermutigen), but this ignores the patterned interplay characteristic of the 8-syllable pādas with what precedes them.
