In pāda a asrídhaḥ is clearly pl., though it occurs in dual context (utá … víṣṇur utá vā́to asrídhaḥ). There seem to be 3 possibilities: 1) it also modifies the gods in pāda b, the Treasure-giver (draviṇodā́ḥ) and Soma; 2) it refers to the gods in general, as in I.3.9 víśve devā́so asrídhaḥ; 3) it refers to goddesses or the trio of goddesses so denominated in I.13.9 íḷā sárasvatī mahī́tisró devī́r mayobhúvaḥ / … asrídhaḥ (note mayobhúvaḥ like máyas karat in our pāda b). There is no clear way to choose, and it scarcely seems to matter. I would of course prefer the third possibility, since it involves a female presence in this vs., but the support for this possibility is not strong.

The vs. contains the 3rd mention of Viṣṇu and the 2nd of the Aśvins; the other divinities are newly named.
