The pedagogical model seen in vs. 3 is made more explicit here: the repetition of one frog’s call by another is likened to that of a pupil and his teacher (śāktásyeva … śikṣamāṇaḥ).

With Maurer, I take sárvam … párva as referring to a group of frogs, not to the section of a lesson with most others.
