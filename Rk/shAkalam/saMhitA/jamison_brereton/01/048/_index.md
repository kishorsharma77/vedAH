Dawn
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
16 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
Another in Praskaṇva Kāṇva’s series devoted to the deities of the early-morning  sacrifice, this hymn to Dawn is especially concerned with the acquisition of goods— a common association because the dakṣiṇā or “priestly gift” is distributed to the  poets and priests at the Morning Pressing. The radiant beauty of Dawn and her  mandate to rouse and animate all living beings are not neglected in the hymn, how ever, especially in the middle verses (5–10). In verses 11–12 she is also, unusually,  charged with a task more appropriate for Agni (see, e.g., I.44), namely conveying  the gods to the sacrifice.
