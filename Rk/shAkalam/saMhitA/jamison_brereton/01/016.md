Indra
Medhātithi Kāṇva
9 verses: gāyatrī
This is nothing more than an extended invitation to Indra to come to the sacrifice,  with a tempting menu of offerings and praises. One might say about this hymn that  it makes reading the R̥gveda seem easy; it also makes it seem not worth the trouble.
## 1
Let the fallow bays convey you here, the bull to drink the soma— those with the eye of the sun (convey) you, Indra.
## 2
Here are the roasted grains, bathing in ghee; the fallow bay pair will  convey Indra here right to them
in the best-naved chariot.
## 3
Indra we invoke early in the morning, Indra as the ceremony advances, Indra to drink of the soma.
## 4
Come up here to our pressed soma, Indra, with your shaggy fallow bays, for when it is pressed we invoke you.
## 5
Come here to this praise of ours, up to this pressing here when it is  pressed.
Drink like a thirsty buffalo.
## 6
Here are the pressed soma drops on the ritual grass.
Drink them, Indra, for might.
## 7
Here is the foremost praise for you; let it be most availing, touching  your heart.
So drink the pressed soma.
## 8
To every pressing when it is pressed Indra goes for exhilaration,
the Vr̥tra-smasher, to drink the soma. 9. Fulfill this desire of ours with cows and horses, o you of a hundred  resolves.
Very attentive, we will praise you.
