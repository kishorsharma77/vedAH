The referent of the dual dhéne “two streams” is not clear to me. Ge takes it as ‘lips’ (< ‘the sucking ones’; see ad I.2.3), but in no other passage is ‘lips’ a possibility. Bloomfield (JAOS 46) suggests it is an elliptical dual, for prayers and libations, expressed by dhénāḥ and dhā́rāḥ respectively in III.1.9, but this relies on an outdated interpretation of dhénā- (see comm. ad I.2.3). H.-P. Schmidt (Fs.

Nyberg) also considers it an elliptical dual, but is himself somewhat elliptical about what the ellipsis would be -- it seems that he considers it both literal (streams of milk) and figurative (streams of song). But RVic poets elsewhere do not resort to the dual to express a literal/metaphorical split. Re takes it as two streams of soma (without identifying which these would be), and WG as two milk-streams (again unidentified). I am inclined to assume that it has been attracted into the dual from the more regular pl. dhénāḥ by the immediately preceding śípre ‘two lips’, given the strict parallelism in syntax and phonology in the two clauses in this pāda: ví ṣyasva śípre ví sṛjasva dhéne, although the existence of another dual dhéne in V.30.9 in an obscure context, may weaken this attraction hypothesis.
