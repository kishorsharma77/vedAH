Read, with Gr and Old, *ávaso (that is, te ‘vaso), which also repairs the meter. The corresponding verses are structured identically, with etā́vataḥ opening the first hemistich and its rhetorical partner yáthā opening the two pādas of the second hemistich. In each verse we seek the same thing for ourselves that Indra provided to two clients, named in the second hemistich. There is also some matching phraseology: etā́vatas te (a), yáthā prā́vo (c), yáthā (d), as well as dháne in 49d and 50c.
