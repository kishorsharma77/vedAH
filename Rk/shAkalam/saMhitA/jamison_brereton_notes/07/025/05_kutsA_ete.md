The opening of my tr. of this verse is meant to capture the odd order of noun and demonstrative, kútsā eté … With Ge I supply a form of √ṛc ‘chant’ as the main verb of the first hemistich, since this verb takes śūṣám as object in a number of passages (e.g., I.9.10, X.96.2).

Cf. nearby VII.23.6 vásiṣṭhāso abhí arcanty arkaíḥ, with the nom. pl. subj. of a group of contemporary singers and the verb √ṛc in the last vs. of the hymn (VII.25.6 is repeated from VII.24.6).
