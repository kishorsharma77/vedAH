Ge’s rendering of ab is not grammatically possible: he takes the subordinate clause as beginning with yád and continuing till the end of b (“weil er ja allein die vielen Feinde erschlägt”), but hanti is unaccented and must therefore belong to the main clause -- despite his rather casual dismissal of the problem (n.

19b). My tr. takes yád dha vṛtrā́as a self-contained subord. clause, with a verb (‘smashes’) to be supplied. Perhaps better is WG’s interpr. of the same sequence as a nominal clause with vṛtrā́as nominative subj.: “wenn es ja Widerstände gibt.” I might emend my tr. to “Indra is praised as the bounteous one; when there are obstacles, he alone smashes (them, though they are) many and unopposable.”
