On the anomalous acc. sg. vedhā́m to vedhás- see Old ad loc.; AiG II.2.225, 725, III.283, 285. Re’s suggestion that it may recall “l’origine lointaine ví-dhā” is best ignored, since Aves. vazdah- rules out a vṛddhi of -i- in the initial syllable of vedhás- (as Re surely knew). Note that the correct pl. to the -as-stem, vedhásaḥ, is found in vs. 6.

For the relationship between ádhi dyávi here and ā́diváḥ in 2c, see immed. above.
