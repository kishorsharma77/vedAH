In the phrase … asyá naḥ, mándasva sakhyásya ca most tr. render the ca as ‘also’ and construe the demonstrative with the noun (Ge “… freue dich auch dieser Freundschaft mit uns”). However, the most natural way to take the syntax is as a conjoined NP: “of this (x) and the comradeship of ours.” The question is what asyá is modifying. Following Gr I supply ‘ritual grass’, because barhíḥ is the most recent ritual referent (4a). Although “rejoicing in ritual grass” may seem an odd activity, cf. VIII.13.4=VIII.15.5 mandānó asyá barhíṣo ví rājasi, with the same verb √mand ‘rejoice’ and the fuller version of the nominal phrase. (As it happens, in that passage I construe the barhis phrase with the main verb ví rājasi, but it is certainly ambiguous.)
