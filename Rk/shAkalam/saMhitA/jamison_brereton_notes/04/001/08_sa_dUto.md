In b the caesura appears to coincide with a compound seam (#hótā híraṇya/ratho …), as HvN also note. This is reminiscent of the proposed caesuras in 4c and 6b, before the splv. suffix -tama. See also 19b.

The first cmpd member ráṃsu- is taken by Schindler (Rt Nns, 40) as the loc. pl. to a root noun rán- ‘Freude’, an analysis accepted by Mayrhofer (EWA s.v. RAṆ).
