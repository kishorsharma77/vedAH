Pregnancy/Birth Charm [To Assorted Divinities]
Tvaṣṭar Garbhakartar or Viṣṇu Prājāpatya
3 verses: anuṣṭubh
This little charm follows naturally on the immediately preceding hymn. There a  married couple prepares to have sex in order to conceive; here a range of gods and  goddesses responsible for conception and safe pregnancy are called upon to ensure  conception followed by a full-term birth.
