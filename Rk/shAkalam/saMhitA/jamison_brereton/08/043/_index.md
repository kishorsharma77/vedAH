Agni  
Virūpa Āṅgirasa  
33 verses: gāyatrī, most likely arranged in trcas ̥  
Though it is likely that this hymn is constructed of tr̥cas, there is little overt unity  within the tr̥cas. On the surface the hymn is a pleasant but generally unremarkable  praise of Agni. His ritual functions are showcased throughout, and toward the end  the “we” of the poet and his fellow sacrificers invoke him more and more insistently1114 VIII.43  
in this role. But earlier in the hymn there is some nice naturalistic description of fire  and fires (vss. 3–10). In verses 14 and 16 the poet emphasizes the kinship between  himself and Agni as poet.  
Another thematic strain evident in the hymn and asserting itself more and more  toward the end is the role of Agni as a unifying focus of various clans and settle ments in the larger Ārya community. In several early verses multiple fires are kin dled at once (vss. 4–5). In light of later parts of the hymn, these can be interpreted  as the separate family or clan fires, which are later joined conceptually in the single  fire to which all the separate groups give allegiance (see esp. vs. 18, also 27, 29). This  single fire, found in multiple places but shared by all the clans, is invoked for help  in combat in verse 21. Agni’s competitive (vss. 20, 25), martial (vss. 21, 23, 26, 32),  and ruling (vs. 24) aspects become more prominent in the second half of the hymn;  the sacrificers clearly wish to harness these powers for the good of the whole com munity. Though not insistent, this theme is pervasive and provides a subtle unity to  this superficially rambling thirty-three-verse composition.
