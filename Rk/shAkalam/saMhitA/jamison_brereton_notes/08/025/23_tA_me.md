This vs. is puzzling, in part because the identity of “these two” (tā́) is not clear nor is the sense of nitóśana- + GEN. The lexeme ní √tuś means ‘overflow with, spill down’ with an acc. of the largesse so spilled. See, e.g., IX.63.23 ní tośase rayím "You [=Soma] spill down wealth" (cf. IV.38.1, VIII.54.8). I take the genitives here as objective gens., corresponding to the acc. in the VP. Since both áśvyānām and hárīṇāṃ refer to horses, we might want the two that are overflowing with them to be the human (or possibly divine) givers. This is possible, if we take them as the two patrons who give horses in 22ab (and not the one who gives a chariot in 22c). Or it could be a reference to Mitra and Varuṇa (so Re). But du. nṛvā́hasā ‘carrying men’ in 23c and vājínāv árvantā “prize-winning chargers” in 24c must surely be horses (probably the silvery and silver horses of 22ab), and this suggests that the duals earlier in vs. 23 should have the same referent. This is Ge’s solution, and he considers this expression shorthand for saying that the two horses given are worth as much as a whole herd of horses. This may be correct, but it is a bit difficult to wring it from the text.

kṛ́tvya- ‘effective, getting results’ is several times used of horses (VI.2.8, IX.46.1, IX.101.2), and in this context that should be the default interpr. as well.
