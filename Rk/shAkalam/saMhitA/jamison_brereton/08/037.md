Indra
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
7 verses: mahāpaṅkti, except atijagatī 1
For the relationship between this hymn and its twin, VIII.36, see the introduction  to the previous hymn. As discussed there, the final verse (7) of this hymn with its  reference to kṣatrā́ṇi “lordly powers” (as opposed to the “priestly formulations” of  VIII.36.7) puts the hymn in the domain of the kṣatriya varṇa. Unlike the previous  hymn, where the brahmanical aspect is muted at best, this hymn does present a  kingly and martial profile in the variant material in the first pādas of verses 2–6.
## 1
You furthered this priestly formulation at the overcoming of obstacles,  furthered (the formulation) of the presser—
– you lord of power, Indra, with all help—at the Midday Pressing,
irreproachable Vr̥tra-smasher, drink of the soma, possessor of the mace. 2. Winning battles against deceits, strong one—
– you lord of power, Indra, with all help—at the Midday Pressing,
irreproachable Vr̥tra-smasher, drink of the soma, possessor of
the mace.

## 3
As lone king do you rule over this creation—
– you lord of power, Indra, with all help—at the Midday Pressing,
irreproachable Vr̥tra-smasher, drink of the soma, possessor of
the mace.
## 4
You, just alone, keep apart the two (hosts) in confrontation—
– you lord of power, Indra, with all help—at the Midday Pressing,
irreproachable Vr̥tra-smasher, drink of the soma, possessor of
the mace.
## 5
Over both peace and hitching up (for war) you are master—
– you lord of power, Indra, with all help—at the Midday Pressing,
irreproachable Vr̥tra-smasher, drink of the soma, possessor of
the mace.
## 6
You help one to lordly power, you did not help another—
– you lord of power, Indra, with all help—at the Midday Pressing,
irreproachable Vr̥tra-smasher, drink of the soma, possessor of
the mace.
## 7
Listen to Śyāvāśva as he “rasps,” just as you listened to Atri as he  performed (ritual) acts.
Alone, you helped Trasadasyu in the conquering of men, Indra,
strengthening the lordly powers.
