I do not understand the function of hí here, which is doubly unusual in occurring both in a relative clause and in the initial clause of a hymn. Hettrich (Hypotaxe, p. 181) also finds it puzzling. Finding hí in the opening pāda of a hymn is not unprecedented (cf., e.g., IV.1.1, VI.1.1, VI.2.1), but the relative clause is a further complication.

The abl. diváḥ is construed by Ge and Re with the voc. vimahasaḥ (Ge “ihr ausgezeichneten (Mannen) des Himmels”), but we might expect it to lose its accent in the vocative phrase, like divo naraḥ (II.36.2, V.54.10) and divo duhitar (IV.51.10, etc.). It is better taken with √pā ‘protect’, which is elsewhere found with the ablative (e.g., X.158.1 sū́ryo no divás pātu), indicating the location of the protector and hence the direction from which the protection comes. So also WG.
