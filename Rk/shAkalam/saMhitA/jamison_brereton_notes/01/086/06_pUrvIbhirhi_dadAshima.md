There is an abrupt shift from the unidentified 3rd sg. worshiper rewarded for his work who dominated vss. 1-5 to the 1st ps. plural, but the rhetorical structure invites the audience to identify the “us” of vs. 6 with the 3rd sg. of the earlier verse.

The dadāśimá ‘we have done pious work’, combined with the causal hí ‘for’, seems to offer a summary of the activities of the previous verses. The repetition of the pl.

carṣaní- in 5b and 6c also supports this identification: he who “dominated” the carṣaní- in 5b can be the same as the “we” who accomplished what we have done with the help of the carṣaní- in 6c. This lexical chaining should have been signaled in the translation, where instead the two words are rendered differently: “bordered domains” (5b), “separate peoples” (6c). I would now use “separate peoples” also for 5b.
