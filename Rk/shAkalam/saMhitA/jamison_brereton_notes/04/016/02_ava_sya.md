Rather than interpr. vedhā́ḥ as part of the simile (e.g., WG “wie die mündige Uśanā”), I take it as referring to Agni, the officiating Hotar-priest, as often. See further support for this identification in the next vs. ### 03
I take the first hemistich as a continuation of 2cd. Phraseology suggests this connection: the simile uśáneva in 2c is matched by the simile beginning 3a kavír ná; together they add up to the full name of the mythic figure Uśanā Kāvya. (kaví- stands in for his patronymic elsewhere: cf. nearby IV.26.1 aháṃ kavír uśánā.) The participial phrase vidáthāni sā́dhan “bringing the rites to realization” has Agni as its subj. elsewhere (e.g., III.1.18 and the other passages adduced by Ge n. 3a). Agni is also often called a kaví-, and I take this word here as referring both to Uśanā Kāvya to whom Agni is compared and to Agni himself.

The subj. of pāda b must be different from that in a; I follow Ge (/WG) in taking it as the pressing stone. The idiom ví √pā ‘extract/separate by drinking’ favors this identification; see comm. ad VII.22.4, which passage also contains a form of √arc as here as well as an overt occurrence of the ‘stone’ (ádri-).

Unlike Ge (/WG) I do not take pāda c as the main clause with b, nor do I think they have the same subject. Rather with Schmidt (B+I, 48-49) I tentatively take Indra as subj. in c (though not, with Schmidt, a and b as well). The Vala myth is quietly introduced in this second half-vs., with Indra’s creation of the poets and then their singing into existence the ritual patterns. With Ge (etc.) it is likely that the seven bards are the Aṅgirases.

There may be a very backgrounded pun in cd: c opens with divá(h) ‘of heaven’, to be construed with saptá kārū́n “seven bards” at the end of the pāda, while d opens with áhnā ‘by day’. Despite the different accent and different case form, it might be possible to take divá (in sandhi) as a variant of dívā ‘by day’, anticipating the instr. ahnā́in the same position in the next pāda. But I am very uncertain about this.

Note the responsion of verse-final act. transitive gṛṇántaḥ to vs.-final med.

passive gṛṇāṇáḥ in 1d.
