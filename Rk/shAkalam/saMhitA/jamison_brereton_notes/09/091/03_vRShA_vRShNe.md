Both Ge and Re take īrte as transitive (‘set in motion’, e.g., “… met en branle … le blanc lait”), but this medial stem is standardly intrans., and the milk here can be, as so often in IX, the goal of Soma’s motion.

In c vaco-víd- could of course also mean ‘who finds speech’. See Scar (487), who allows both senses for the stem and tr. the occurrence here as “der die Reden findet.” In this ritual context there is little difference between ‘knowing speech’ and ‘finding speech’.

Pāda d cannot be separated from IX.10.5 sū́rā áṇvaṃ ví tanvate “the suns stretch out across the fine (fleece).”
