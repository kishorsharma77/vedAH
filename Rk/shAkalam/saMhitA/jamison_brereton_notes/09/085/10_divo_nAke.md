The cosmic/natural and the earthly/ritual double vision is played out simultaneously throughout this vs. In ab the seekers milk the streams “in the vault of heaven” (divó nā́ke) but milk them out of “the mountain-dwelling ox” (ukṣáṇaṃ giristhā́m), the earthly soma plant. In c the drop grows strong not only “in the waters” (apsú), presumably the ritual waters used to swell the plant, but also “in the sea” (samudrá ā́); in d it is both “in the wave of the river” (síndhor ūrmā́) and “in the filter” (pavítra ā́).

On the basis of the shared verb (duhate in 9d, duhanti in 10b) the venā́ḥ here appear to be identical to the subjects of 9d, as suggested above.

Pāda b is identical to IX.73.4. As noted in the comm. thereon, there is good reason to supply “streams” (dhā́rāḥ) as the referent for the pl. adjs. mádhujihvā(ḥ) and asaścátaḥ, which are therefore fem. acc. pl. Curiously Ge takes the former as nom. pl. m. here, though fem. in 73.4, while Ober (II.13149-50, ) takes them both as nom. pl. m.; Re tr. as I do.
