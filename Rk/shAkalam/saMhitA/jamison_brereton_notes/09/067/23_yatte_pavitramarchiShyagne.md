The image of the filter stretched out in Agni’s flame is striking, but I don’t know exactly what the picture is meant to be - in contemplating the fire do we have a vision of a purifying apparatus? Or is the expression simply a fancy way of saying “the purifier that is your flame”? The beginning of the next vs., with pavítram arcivát, would support the latter suggestions.

Ge takes bráhma as obj. of punīhi: “… mit der [=pavítram] läutere unsere feierliche Rede.” But 1) this would break the pattern of punātu / punīhi naḥ “purify us” in vss. 22, 24, 26) by demoting naḥ from object; 2) bráhma as a means of purification is found in the next vs. in the cmpd brahmasavaíḥ. The fairly strict rhetorical patterning of these vss. therefore imposes (at least to my view) an instrument-of-means reading on bráhma, and I see no reason why it can’t be part of the definitional preposed rel. cl. yád te “what is your …,” parallel to pavítram. yád would be appropriate to both, since they are both neut., and they are then both picked up by instr. téna in c. That bráhma has been postponed till the beginning of c is not surprising, given the long NP containing pavítram. The new cl. begins mid-pāda with téna; since sá/tám forms regularly take init. position in pāda / clause, the mid-pāda position here suggests that it begins a new cl. and bráhma is not part of it. Like Ge, Re makes bráhma somehow oblique, but I don’t really understand what he’s trying to convey: “clarifies en notre Formule.”
