As Ge points out (n. 10a), the three divinized principles in pāda a—Good Fortune, Insight, and Plenitude—are what the poet needs for success.

As the layout of the publ. tr. shows, I take pāda b as a parenthetical insertion in the sentence that includes a, cd. It would be possible to take vājáyantaḥ as a predicated pres. part. and a separate cl., though this seems less likely to me.

Although gnā́spáti- presumably contains the old gen. sg. of gnā́- (e.g., AiG III.119, 129), I tr. it as a pl., since we usually hear of “wives (of the gods)” - though, since I don’t exactly know what Narāśaṃsa (=Agni?) is doing here, perhaps there’s only one wife. It is also not clear if there are two figures here or if gnā́spátiḥ characterizes Narāśaṃsa as I have taken it (so also Ge, WG). Re does so in tr., but suggests in his n. that it might identify a separate individual, perhaps Tvaṣṭar, whose association with divine females is well established. I now am inclined in that direction and would provide an alternate tr. “Narāśaṃsa (and) the Husband of the (divine) Wives should help us.” That the verb is singular is not an impediment, since a series of sg. subjects can take a sg. verb.

This verb, avyāḥ, is a bit of a problem. It is isolated in the averbo of the root √av ‘help’, which is seṭ and has a well-attested iṣ-aor. (on which see Narten 86-89) beside the even better attested them. pres. Although Narten (86) identifies our avyā́ḥ (also X.139.5) as belonging to an old root aor. (with maintenance of the full grade despite despite being opt.), there are no other unambig. root aor. forms attested (though forms like ā́vīt could of course belong to a seṭ root aor. paradigm and have given rise to the iṣ-aor.). I think it’s more likely an artificial form, makeshift replacement for the non-existent iṣ-aor. opt. (see my 2009 “Where Are All the Optatives?” pp. 31-32 on the absence of act. sigmatic optatives, flg. Narten), as well as the relative dearth even of 3rd sg. thematic optatives to present stems (like ávati), on which see the same art., pp. 32-34.

As for the point of the pāda: it is possible that the arousing of the three principles in pāda a reminds the poet that he needs the help of the ritual fire (if Narāśaṃsa is identified with Agni here). Perhaps gnā́spátiḥ is invoked because two of the three principles are female. But this seems like groping in the dark.
