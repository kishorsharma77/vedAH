I think ná in c does double duty: first and primarily as the negative with mināti, but also as a simile marker following yóṣā. The rest of the simile (niṣkṛtám ācárantī) follows in the next pāda. For yóṣā explicitly in a similar simile see VI.75.4 té ācárantī sámaneva yóṣā “The two …, like a maiden faring forth to (festive) gatherings.”
