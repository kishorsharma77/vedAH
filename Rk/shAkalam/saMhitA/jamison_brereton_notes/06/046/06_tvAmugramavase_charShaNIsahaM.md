The distracted acc. t u vā́m from 1a, c, d returns here, again as object of “we call,” but with hūmahe rather than the hávāmahe of vs. 1.

On pibdaná- see also comm. ad IX.15.6. The stem is obviously derived from a redupl. form of √pad; cf. the hapax med. part. píbdamāna- (X.101.11). The orig.

sense is likely ‘keep stepping, go step-by-step,’ vel sim., as an iter. See EWA s.v. PAD, with ref. to Strunk and Gotō. A literal gloss could then be ‘plod, trudge’. This literal sense is seen, in my view, in the participle in X.101.11 váhnir āpíbdamānaḥ ‘plodding draught horse’, and in IX.15.6 I also take vásūni pibdanā́as a somewhat comic reference to cows as “plodding goods.” Our passage here is more difficult, as the word is contrasted with vithurá- ‘wavering’; this opposition accounts for the standard glosses as (Gr) ‘feststehend, fest’, (AiG II.2.595 ‘fest’ (but .203 ‘erstarkend’), (Ge) ‘dauerhaft’, (Re) ‘solides’ (both latter in IX.15.6), but my ‘gain(ing) a foothold’ seems to preserve the root etymology and sense, while fitting the context.
