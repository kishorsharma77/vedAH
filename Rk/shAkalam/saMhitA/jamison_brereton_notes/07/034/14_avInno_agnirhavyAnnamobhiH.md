Initial injunc. 3rd sg. -iṣ-aor. ávīn (for ávīt) matches the init. áviṣṭa (+u) of 12a, which I (and the standard tr.) take as a 2nd pl. -iṣ-aor. impv. Re. takes ávīt here as hortatory/imperatival (“Qu’Agni favorise …”), but I see no problem in having a preterital (or perhaps general present “Agni aids …”) injunc. form in this vs. characterizing an individual god. The 2nd pl. is found in the hortatory address to the gods in general, parallel to impv. kṛṇota in 12c, whereas ávīt is followed by an augmented pass. aor. adhāyi, expressing the reciprocal human action in response to the god’s help. 46 The first half-vs. contains two exx. of -t/d à -n sandhi before nasal: (ávīt à) ávīn no and (havyā́d à) havyā́n námobhiḥ. Re renders the latter as if it were an acc. pl. to havyá- (“… favorise nos oblations”), but this must be an example of a hasty Homeric nod, since havyá- ‘oblation’ is always neut.

Whose námobhiḥ? Ge takes them as Agni’s, which he offers to the gods. I think it more likely that it refers to our acts of reverence to Agni, to which he reciprocates by aiding us. So also Scar (40: “durch {unsere} Ehrerbietungen”). Re takes námobhiḥ with the following clause: “Avec hommages a été déposée … la louange …”). This avoids the problem and works well semantically, but in this hymn verses regularly fall into two clauses separated by the half-vs. boundary, and there are no examples of a portion of b adjoined to the clause of cd.
