On madacyút- and vipaścít- see, e.g., Scar (128 and 122 respectively).

gaurī́is the loc. sg. to the vṛkī́-stem gaurī́-, not a dual (per Gr); see AiG III.170 and comm. ad VII.103.2 (sarasī́) and I.135.9 (nadī́). As indicated in the publ. intro., of the possible referents for this buffalo cow, with Ge and Re (see esp. Re’s n.) I favor the hide on which the pressing apparatus is placed -- as opposed to Sāy’s ‘speech’, or Lü’s more complex speech identified with the heavenly waters.
