Multiple candidates have been suggested for the three lights of d, but it should be pointed out that there is actually only one light (jyótiḥ), which has three vartu-s (trivártu). Unfortunately this adj. is a hapax, but it is most likely related to the better attested trivṛ́t-. For the relationship between these two and the uncertainty of the root affiliation (√vṛt [which I favor] or √vṛ), see Scar (511). If the form does belong with √vṛt we should properly expect *trivarttu, but of course rTT and rT clusters can generally only be distinguished on etymological grounds (see AiG I.112-14). As for our form, AiG II.2.663 (with lit.) suggests that trivár(t)u in this passage is a nonce creation modeled on well-attested tridhā́tu found in the preceding pāda (c).

In any case the triply layered shelter and triply turned light conform to the triadic focus of this hymn; I’m not sure they need to be more specifically identified. 133
