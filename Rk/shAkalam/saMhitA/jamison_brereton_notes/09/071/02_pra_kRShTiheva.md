gúhā padám and IX.10.9 divás padám … gúhā hitám. Both Re and Lü take apīcyàm padám together, but Re interprets padám as ‘word’ (“le mot secret de la vâche” - though ‘word’ for padá- is barely found in the RV if at all) and Lü as ‘place’, which he further specifies, in his usualy style, as the “Milchflut im Himmel.” On the basis of the formula just cited, I prefer ‘track’, with the verbs of motion in c indicating that Soma is following this track (which, on the basis of 102.2 I think is the track through the filter) to his rendezvous with the milk.

matútha- is a hapax whose formation is unclear, but a derivation from √man ‘think’ is the default (see EWA s.v. MAN1 ). It merits no mention in AiG (at least acdg.

to the index thereto), but see Re’s plausible suggestion that it is connected to mántu-.
