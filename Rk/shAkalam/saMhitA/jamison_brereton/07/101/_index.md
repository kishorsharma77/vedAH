Parjanya
Kumāra Āgneya or Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
Dedicated to Parjanya, the god of thunder, this hymn celebrates the fructifying rain  in sometimes cryptic and riddling terms, which probably involve simultaneous natu ral and ritual reference. The number three is a recurrent theme: the “three speeches”  of verse 1; the “triply layered” shelter and “triply turned” light of verse 2; the three  heavens, three stages of flowing water, and three buckets of verse 4. There is also, as  often with R̥gvedic atmospheric phenomena, gender ambiguity and gender shifting.  The bull of verse 1 creates a calf as his embryo. In verse 3 an unidentified subject  (though surely Parjanya) is sometimes a barren cow and sometimes gives birth.  (The “he” of the translation is a necessary English compromise: the Sanskrit has  no pronominal subject and therefore no gender identifier.) Later in that verse the  father provides milk to the mother. As is often the case with R̥gvedic enigmas, it is likely that there is no one correct answer to the riddles, which are instead meant to  stimulate creative speculation.
