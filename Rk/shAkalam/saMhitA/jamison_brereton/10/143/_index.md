Aśvins
Atri Sāṃkhya
6 verses: anuṣṭubh
The poet of this hymn is presumably one of the younger Atrids, not the Atri who  is the eponymous poet of the Vth Maṇḍala, and the whole hymn is devoted to requests for help from the Aśvins for him and his fellows. In the first two verses he  asks that the Aśvins aid him as they did others in past times. The third verse offers  recompense for their aid: if they help him to produce insightful poems, these poems  will be for them alone. Verses 4 and 6 expand the targets of the aid from Atri alone  to his ritual companions, while verse 5 offers the mythological example of Bhujyu,  often mentioned elsewhere as a client whose life the Aśvins saved, as a model for  what we ourselves hope for.
