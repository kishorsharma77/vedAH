As noted in the publ. intro., every vs. but the final one has a form of √pū ‘purify’ beginning a pāda (though, interestingly, never the vs.), with each one different: 1b pavítre, 2b pávasva, 3b pávamāna, 4c pávate, 5c pávatām. This pattern is reminiscent of the “versified paradigm” of the first hymn in the RV, I.1. And the abrupt cessation of the pattern in the last vs. is of course also typical of RVic style.
