On -niṣṣídh- see comm. ad III.51.5. It is possible here that -niṣṣídh- ‘tributes’ are owed to Dadhikrā rather than provided by him. Cf. Klein (DGRV I.420) “to whom many tributes are due”; this would fit better with carkṛ́tyam aryáḥ.

For pruṣita-psu- ‘frothing at the mouth’ (< ‘having spraying breath’), see EWA s.v. psu-.
