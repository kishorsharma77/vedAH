The first hemistich has 11 syllables and is best interpreted as a Triṣṭubh, with HvN.

The verse is otherwise problematic, and my interpretation differs sharply from that of others. The crucial point of difference is áhan, which is universally taken as the 2nd sg. impf. of √han ‘smite’. This seems to me contextually very unlikely: √han is a very rare verb with Agni as subject, and when it is found, it is almost always of Agni’s special form as rakṣo-hán- (see IV.3.14, V.2.10, VI.16.29, and with a different object V.4.5). The context does not favor a verb of violence, and I find it hard to believe that √han would be attributed to Agni out of the blue, esp.

without specifying an object and esp. announcing this action as his particular “wondrous power” (dáṃsaḥ). Instead I take it as the loc. sg. of áhar ‘day’, in the formula samāné áhan “on the same day” (cf. I.34.3, 186.4), with the samāné suggested by (or suppressed by) adjacent samānaíḥ. (Something like this possibility is considered by Old in his n. in SBE and attributed to Aufrecht in Noten.) The major argument against this interpr, as far as I can see, is the double yád, which is unusual under any interpretation but passes better with two verbs (yád áhan … yád … vivéḥ) than one. I do not have a good solution for this doubling. Either it is rhetorical or simply pleonastic, or it marks off nṛ́bhiḥ … yuktáḥ as a quasi circumstantial clause: “This is your wondrous power, that (yád 1) on the (same) day, when (yád 2) yoked with the same men, you …” But I know of no parallels for such a usage. Another argument for seeing √han here, made by Old (Noten), comes from X.147.1, which contains both áhan and vivér apáḥ (see immed. below), but I do not think that very late hymn, dedicated to Indra, should overly influence our interpretation of this passage.

With Old (SBE and Noten) I read vivér ápāṃsi, against Pp. vivé rápāṃsi; Old’s parallels are very persuasive, and this analysis does not require a change in the Saṃhitā text. Ge’s tr. appears to follow the Pp. reading, however, as does Re’s, though in his n. he accepts Old’s reading.
