It seems a little odd to say that chariot horses go “each separately,” since one would think that the horses would be attached to the same chariot and efficient movement would require them to pull together. But almost the same phrase occurs in X.91.7 … rathyò yáthā pṛ́thak, though there referring to charioteers, and so the words must belong together. Perhaps it refers to separate chariots, each with its own set of horses—or that each horse in a chariot team has its own place in harness and each individually contributes to the speed of the whole?
