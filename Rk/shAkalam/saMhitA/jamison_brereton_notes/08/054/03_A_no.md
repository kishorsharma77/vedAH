Though this vs. continues the list of gifts begun in vs. 2, it is entirely in the accusative, while vs. 2 is in the nominative. There is no verb governing vs. 3, and I simply tr. as part of the list.

In the publ. tr. “ewes” should be in parens.

Ge. tr. áruṣīṇāṃ cátuḥśatam as “hundertundvier rötliche (Schafe)” (my italics), which makes one wonder about his barnyard experience. Wikipedia tells me that there does exist something called the Armenian red sheep (or Armenian mouflon, etc.), native to Iran and Armenia. But since the gifts celebrated in dānastutis are domestic animals, this information doesn’t seem helpful. There is also something called the California red sheep, but this hybrid was only developed in the 1970s and half a world away from Dasyave Vṛka. On the other hand, “black” sheep are often more brownish than black and in certain lights could appear reddish. There is also a (recent?) breed of Indian sheep known as Bannur or Mandya, some of which appear (on Google Images) reddish.
