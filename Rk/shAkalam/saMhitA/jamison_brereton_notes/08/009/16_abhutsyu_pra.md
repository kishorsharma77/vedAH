Ge tr. devyā́… vācā́(belonging to different pādas) as “mit der göttlichen Rede,” which is certainly possible. But since Dawn is explicitly the topic of the next two vss. (17-18) and since there’s a voc. devi (or possibly, against the Pp., a nom. devī́) in pāda c, it seems best to separate the two instrumentals and take devyā́as referring to Dawn. The poet has awoken with the advent of the goddess Dawn (the natural world) at the same time as the ritual speech directed to the Aśvins commences.

If nom. devī́is read here, vy ā̀var can be 3rd ps., not 2nd. But I see no reason to go against the Pp. in this case, since Dawn is addressed in the voc. (uṣaḥ) in both 17a and 18a, and the unambiguous voc. devi is found in 17b.
