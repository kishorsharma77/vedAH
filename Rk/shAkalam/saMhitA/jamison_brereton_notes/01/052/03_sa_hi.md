A challenging verse, describing Indra in unusual ways and deploying unusual words and constructions.

The first pāda contains the difficult but clearly related words dvaró dvaríṣu, which seem also to belong with vṛ̥́ka-dvaras- (II.30.8) ‘having the X of a wolf’.

Wackernagel (1918 [see details in EWA s.v. dvará-] = KlSch 325-26) adduces the Avestan root duuar, which expresses a daevic way of moving. If vṛ̥́ka-dvaras- means ‘having the movement/gait of a wolf’, I tr. the words in this passage as ‘skulking, skulker’, as characteristic of a wolf.

The rest of the first pāda consists of vavrá ū́dhani. The latter is clearly a locative, but the former is taken by the Pp. as vavráḥ, nom. sg. of vavrá- ‘cave, cavity’ out of sandhi, an interpretation followed by the standard tr. and argued for by Old. (Gr, however, takes it as a 3rd sg. pf. to √vṛ ‘cover’, vavré.) The sense is taken to be “a cavity at the (soma) udder”; that is, Indra’s mouth, throat, and stomach are an enormous empty space to be filled with soma. By contrast I take it as a loc. to the same noun vavrá- and a simultaneous reference to the Vṛtra myth and the Vala myth, as well as fitting the image conjured up by the dvar-words. To start with the last, caves are good places to skulk and quite possibly a haunt of wolves. As for the Vṛtra myth, Vṛtra himself is called a vavrá- in V.32.8, while Vala is itself a cave and the word vavré is several times used of this myth and Indra’s involvement in it (IV.1.13, V.31.3). Thus Indra is “skulking” in the vicinity of these mythological enemies in the first part of this verse. The published tr. limits the reference of vavré to the Vṛtra myth; I would now expand that.

I then take the adjacent loc. ū́dhani as contrastive and construe it with pāda b: Indra skulks near his enemies (the “cavities”), but at the (soma-)udder he becomes roused to elation and display his golden foundation, that is, the riches he will dispense in return for the soma. Indra’s bright budhná- here contrasts with the budhná- associated with Vṛtra in vs. 6, where the latter lies on the budhná- “of the dusky realm” (rájasaḥ).

The last part of the last pāda, sá hí páprir ándhasaḥ, is also problematic. It is universally interpreted as “he is filled / fills himself with soma,” which makes good sense. Unfortunately it does violence to the grammar. First, pápri- does not otherwise mean ‘filling’ (in my opinion, but see, e.g., Grestenberger, JAOS 133.2: 271, though she does not give exx.), but either ‘providing’ or ‘delivering’.

Furthermore, reduplicated -i-nominals are otherwise agentive (AiG II.2.291-93) and regularly take accusatives (see esp. VI.50.13 dā́nu pápriḥ ‘supplying gifts’)(see Grestenberger JAOS 133.2). Ge is aware of the morphological problem (though not, it seems, the semantic one) and in his n. suggests that the form is either reflexive or that jaṭháram ‘belly’ should be supplied, but there is no basis for either of these solutions. Therefore, although I see the attractions of “is filled with soma,” I do not see a way to wrest this meaning out of the text. Instead I take ándhasaḥ as a causal ablative and pápriḥ in the same fashion as VI.50.13. The clause then paraphrases pāda b: Indra provides wealth because he becomes exhilarated on soma.
