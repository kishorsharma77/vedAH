The semantically complementary expressions referring to giving with the left and right hands have different morphological realizations: instr. savyéna and the hapax adv. dakṣiṇít. The latter is, of course, anomalously formed; it appears also in the cmpd. pradakṣiṇít (6x), which may be the basis here as well -- note immediately preceding prá. Thieme (KZ 69 [1951] = KlSch 71) suggests that it’s a cmpd with the root noun to √i ‘go’ (with the expected empty -t stem final); others that it contains the relic of a PIE instr. ending in -t/d. For a full disc. see Scar (42-44). Since the first is not straightforward functionally (“going to the right” is not its sense) and the second depends on a highly dubious morphological reconstruction, I withhold judgment on the source of the form, but see ubhayāhastí (or -ī̇) in V.39.1 below. The lack of morphological parallelism in this passage is not surprising, since the hymn tends towards slightly skewed expressions.
