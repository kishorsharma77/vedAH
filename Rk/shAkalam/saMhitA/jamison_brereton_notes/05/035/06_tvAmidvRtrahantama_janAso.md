Note the phonol. figure pūrvī́ṣu pūrv(i)yám, though the words belong to diff.

stems. The referent of fem. pūrvī́ṣu is not clear. Gr suggests ājíṣu from 7b, and this seems to have met general acceptance (Ge, with ?; WG; Bloomfield RReps, 256), even though ājí- is actually masc., a fact no one remarks on. (Gr cites a single. fem.

form, in I.116.15, but nothing in that passage signals that gender.) We could, of course, suggest a different word for ‘battle’ with fem. gender, like pṛ́tanā or samád-; there is weak support for both (/either) of these because they both are construed in the loc. pl. with ugrá-, which is also found here: ugrám … samátsu in an oft-repeated pāda (III.30.22, etc.); VII.56.23 ugráḥ pṛ́tanāsu, VIII.61.12, 70.4 ugrám (…) pṛ́tanāsu. An entirely different referent is also possible: ‘peoples’ comes to mind, picking up the jánāsaḥ of pāda b, with several different possible fem. stems as substitute: kṣití- from 2c or the developed sense of carṣaṇí-, extractable from 1c (cf. III.43.2 pūrvī́ḥ … carṣaṇī́ḥ) or víś- (cf. VII.31.10 víśaḥ pūrvī́ḥ).
