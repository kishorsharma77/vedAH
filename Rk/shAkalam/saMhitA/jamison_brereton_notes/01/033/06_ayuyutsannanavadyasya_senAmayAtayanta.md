The Navagvas are ordinarily adherents of Indra’s. In order to preserve this alliance, we must assume that the plural reference in pādas a-c alternates, with a and c referring to Indra’s enemies, and b to his friends.

vṛṣāyúdho ná vádhrayaḥ is the clearest echo in this hymn of the phraseology of the immediately preceding, very famous hymn depicting the Indra-Vṛtra battle: I.32.7c vṛ́ṣṇo vádhriḥ pratimā́nam búbhūṣan “a steer who tried to be the measure of a bull.” citáyantaḥ is unclear, as forms built to this stem often are, and the tr. differ appreciably: Ge “zu Einsicht kommend,” WG “erkennend,” Re “se rendant compte.” In my opinion, it is in its usual intrans. value “appearing” and adds a simile-like aspect to the main verb āyan, a sort of utprekṣā.
