The pl. “wives” (pátnīḥ), as often in the RV, must refer to the Wives of the Gods. As I have argued elsewhere (“‘Sacrificer's Wife’ in the Rig Veda: Ritual Innovation?” 2018 in Proceedings of the 13th World Skt. Conf., 2006), one of the models for the introduction of the Sacrificer’s Wife (pátnī) in Vedic ritual, beginning in the late RV, is the presence of the Wives of the Gods on the ritual ground, as here.

Tvaṣṭar is their usual companion and chaperone. He is also associated with the shaping of the embryo in the womb, as in the pregnancy charm X.184.1. The request that he confer heroes on us here must be a prayer for sons (who will become) heroes.
