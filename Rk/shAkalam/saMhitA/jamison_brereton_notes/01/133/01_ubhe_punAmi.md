The popular, Atharvan-like character of the first hymn of this composite (see publ. intro.) (vss. 1-5) is partly signalled by the two l-forms in this verse: abhivlágya and vailasthāná-. Both forms are found only in this hymn. The first belongs to the putative root √vlag, confined to this hymn (this gerund 1c, 2a; nominal abhivlaṅga4b); the second, in the variants vailasthānaká- and mahā́vailastha-, appears also in 3c, d. Neither has an agreed-upon etymology. For √vlag EWA suggests a connection with √vṛj ‘twist’. I see it rather as an l-form of √vraj ‘proceed, advance upon’, which in several of its (few) occurrences also appears with abhí. The nasal in abhivlaṅgamight be a problem, but roots ending in -j are prone to secondary nasals (√raj, rañj ‘color’, √saj, sañj ‘hang’, probably √svaj, svañj ‘embrace’).

As for vaila(-sthana-), it also has been subjected to multiple etymologies (see disc. WG ad loc.). I take it as an l-form of vṛddhied vīrá- ‘hero’; the vṛddhied r-form is found in vaíra(-deya-) (V.61.8) ‘(payment) of wergeld’. The ‘place of vaira-/vaila’ would be ‘the place of heroes or heroism’, i.e., the battlefield.

Note the juxtaposition across pāda-boundary of ṛténa ‘with truth’ and drúhaḥ ‘deceits’. I take anindrā́ḥ as implicitly contrastive with mahī́ḥ: though the lies may be great, they lack Indra and therefore lack ultimate power.
