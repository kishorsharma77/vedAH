arhariṣváṇiḥ is completely unclear; -sváni- is ‘sound, noise’, but the first member appears nowhere else and has no etymology. All tr. take it as a cry of triumph, but this unanimity reflects a dearth of other choices rather than conviction in its rightness. Ge suggests arhari might be onomatopoetic, but it’s hard to see what sound it’s imitating. One tack might be to play with MIA possibilities, but juggling the phonology according to known MIA sound laws has not so far yielded anything useful.
