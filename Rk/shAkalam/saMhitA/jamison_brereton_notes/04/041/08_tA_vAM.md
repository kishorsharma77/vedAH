Vs.-initial tā́is ambiguous: it can represent either masc. du. tā́supporting the immed. flg. enclitic vām (as so often; see my “Vedic ‘sá figé’: An inherited sentence connective?” Historische Sprachforschung 105 [1992]) or fem. pl. tā́ḥ (so Pp.) modifying dhíyaḥ. Or, my preference, both.

Although, strictly speaking, fem. vājayántīḥ belongs in the frame, modifying dhíyaḥ, in sense it fits better with the simile, since contests are where prizes are won.

Moreover, see the next vs. (9d) where fem. ‘fleet mares’(raghvī́ḥ) seek fame -- so female racehorses would be possible in the simile here.

In c śriyé has double sense, belonging both to śrī́‘glory, splendour’ and to √śrī ‘mix’, as Ge and Re point out. The latter is appropriate to the simile, the former to the frame.

Acdg. to WG, the gíraḥ go to Indra and the manīṣā́ḥ to Varuṇa. Although, as was noted above, this is the first place in the hymn where the two names are singular, not associated as a dual, I think it unlikely that the different vocal products have different divine goals. Note that in the first half of the vs. the dhíyaḥ are going to both, and the repeated manīṣā́ḥ in the next vs. go to both as well. That gíraḥ immediately follows índram in 8d is not significant; In all but one instance (9a) of the two names, something intervenes.
