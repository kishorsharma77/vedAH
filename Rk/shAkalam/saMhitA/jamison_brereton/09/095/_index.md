Soma Pavamāna
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
5 verses: triṣṭubh
As in the preceding hymn, IX.94, the complementarity and interaction between  Soma’s poetic efforts and those of the ritualists provide the subject of this hymn.  Soma’s speech is the topic of the first two verses, culminating in 2cd in his revelation  of the “hidden names of the gods” that will be proclaimed aloud on the ritual ground.  But the verbal compositions of the mortals take center stage in verses 3–4. In the final  verse (5), Soma both prompts the speech of others and (it seems) produces his own.
