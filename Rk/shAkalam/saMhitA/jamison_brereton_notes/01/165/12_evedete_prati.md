The med. part. dádhānāḥ is generally tr. ‘receiving’, as the middle voice of √dhā often is, and interpr. to mean that the Maruts also get fame as part of Indra’s reflected glory (see práti … rocamānā(ḥ) in a). But in this charged context of tributes given and received, I think it likely that it is ambiguous. Indra is both graciously yielding the Maruts some glory, but he is also reminding them that they have just produced praise for him (vs. 11) and will presumably continue to do so. In this second sense it could be tr. “setting out praise (for me)” with the middle voice reflecting the mutually intertwined relationship between Indra and the Maruts.

With most interpr. I take ánedyaḥ as a nom. sg. m. implicitly modifying an unexpressed gaṇáḥ ‘troop’, a construcio ad sensum with the pl. dádhānāḥ. I would like to find some way to ally it with nédīyas- ‘nearer’, as a neut. sg. modifying śrávaḥ, but this seems beyond the realm of possibility.

The saṃcákṣyā of the Saṃhitā text is read saṃcakṣya by the Pp. and taken as a gerund, an interpr. followed by Old inter alia. The meaning would be “having looked upon (me)” vel sim. Gr (fld. by Ge [WG], etc., incl. the publ. tr.) takes it as a gerundive, whose pausal form would be saṃcákṣyāḥ. Both forms are possible. I do not have a strong feeling either way.

Note the pāda-final nūnám, reminiscent of nú in 5c and 9a.
