As noted in the publ. intro., I consider the birth described here to be that of Agni (as throughout the rest of Dīrghatamas’s corpus and esp. in vs. 1 of this hymn), not of Mitra and Varuṇa (with the standard tr.). I construe the Wackernagelpositioned vām with dákṣase in b. This dákṣas- is then the referent of īm in c.

I also take c as subordinated to d (with Re), not ab (with the others). That both c and d have 2nd du. pres. verbs (bhárathaḥ … vīthaḥ) is suggestive, and the present in c does not work very well with the mythological past in ab.
