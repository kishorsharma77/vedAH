Three of the four cadences in this verse are bad (b, c, d).

ṛjīpín- (2x) must be closely related to better-attested ṛjipyá- (6x), which also has Iranian cognates, e.g., Aves. ərəzifiia-. Werba bei EWA, s.v., suggests that it is a contamination with ṛjīṣín-, which seems a promising suggestion.

Goto (1st Kl, 171-72, flg. Wackernagel) argues that the thematic middle dádate is synchronicially distinct from √dā 'give' and means 'keep safe'. My ‘hanging onto’ represents a compromise between such a rendering and ‘take’, the standard sense of medial (ā́) √dā (see 7a ādā́ya).
