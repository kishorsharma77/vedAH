The standard tr. (Ge [/WG]) take viyóṣat as intransitive, a view argued for by Narten (Sig. aor. 214), with a neut. pl. subj. (sakhyā́) of a sg. verb. For my argument for a trans. interpr. of this s-aorist, see comm. ad II.32.2. As at II.32.2 I take sakhyā́here as an instr. sg. of separation, though an acc. pl. obj. (“he will not keep our partnerships far away”) is also possible.

Note that tanūpā́ḥ picks up 7d tanvò bodhi gopā́ḥ.
