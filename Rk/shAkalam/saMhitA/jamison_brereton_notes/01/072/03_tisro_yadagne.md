For my interpr. of the purport of this verse in a Tānunāptra context, see publ.

intro.

The identity of the subjects in this verse is disputed: Ge “die Erzväter,” Sāy the Maruts, Re the gods. I consider this vs. a continuation (of sorts) of vs. 2 with víśve amṛ́tāḥ still the subject. I have no explanation for the “three autumns.” The interpretation of the verb form saparyā́n is quite problematic. It certainly appears to be a subjunctive, and contrasts with the 3rd pl. injunctive saparyan that Parāśara places in the same pāda-final position in I.70.10. But a subjunctive does not sit comfortably in the dependent clause whose main clause contains a preterital perfect (dadhire) and an augmented imperfect (ásūdayanta). Ge (also Re) compares várdhān in I.70.7 (which I take differently) and calls it the subjunctive “bei Zeitangabe” (n. to I.70.7ab), whatever that means. He tr. it as a preterite. Hoffmann calls it a “Konjunktiv in präterital Sachverhalt” (p. 244). Re “ont honoré et honoreront encore,” attributing what seems to me a unique interpretation to the subjunctive. I consider the form a straight preterital and have an admittedly quite ad hoc way to account for the apparent subjunctive. The present participle to this stem, saparyánt-, is found 7x pāda-final as nom. sg. masc. saparyán; I suggest that in order to make it clear that the form here is not that pres. participle, the final vowel was lengthened, perhaps redactionally. This lengthening has no metrical consequences, of course. The lengthening did not happen in saparyan in I.70.10 because it was unaccented and couldn’t be mistaken for a participle. I am quite unhappy with this explanation but even more unhappy with the idea of a subjunctive in this context.
