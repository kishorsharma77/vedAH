Soma Pavamāna
Agni Cākṣuṣa (1–3), Cakṣus Mānava (4–6), Manu Āpsava (7–9), Agni Cākṣuṣa (10–14) 14 verses: uṣṇih
This last hymn in the uṣṇih collection, as is common with hymns positioned at  the end of their metrical grouping, is too long and needs to be broken down into  smaller units: four tr̥cas (vss. 1–3, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12) followed by a two-verse hymn  (13–14). In this case the division is in general accord with the Anukramaṇī, which  ascribes the hymn to three different mythical poets, marked by their patronymic  relationships as grandson, son, and father, each with a tr̥ca. The grandson returns  as poet of the last five verses, that is, of the final tr̥ca (10–12) and the two-verse unit  that ends the hymn.
The contents of the hymn are entirely conventional, with a focus on Indra as  drinker of the soma, especially in the first part of the hymn. Note that “finding the  sun” is also a preoccupation, and that word (svarvíd) appears once in each of the  first three tr̥cas (vss. 1, 4, 9).
