Ge seems to take the participle mányamānasya as a functional reflexive ‘think oneself to be’, with the added sense of self-conceit (“der du dir darauf etwas einbildest”). Although I would certainly not ascribe to Indra excessive modesty, in this context, where the poet is emphasizing the poets’ inability to capture all of Indra’s greatness, I think it unlikely that he is focusing on Indra’s egotism. I instead take the participle in a passive sense ‘be thought to be’, as sometimes elsewhere - pace Kulikov (339-40), who follows Gotō. 26
