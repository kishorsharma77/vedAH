On the apparent bad cadence produced by ávidhat see comm. ad II.1.7.

The curious long final of rákṣatī is not remarked on by the standard tr./comm.; the Pp simply reads it short. In my view it represents rákṣati + ī, the latter the enclitic acc. pronoun related to īm, which latter follows the first, parallel verb in the pāda, uruṣyáti + īm. They would show a phonologically motivated distribution here, with īm before vowel and ī before consonant, and would be positioned identically, immediately after a clause-initial verb and before an ablative.
