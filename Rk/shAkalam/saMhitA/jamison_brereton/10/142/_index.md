Agni  
The four Śārṅgas: Jaritar 1–2, Droṇa 3–4, Sārisrkva 5–6, Stambamitra 7–8 ̥ 8 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1–2, anuṣṭubh 7–8  
Though short, this hymn displays both a well-articulated structure and intricate pat terns of repetition and phonological echoes. The first six verses, in trimeter meter,  have an outer ring (vss. 1, 6) and an inner, thematically contrasting core. Verse 1  praises the protective, ritual fire, and verse 6 returns to this prize-giving fire and  the divine attendance upon it. In between, verses 2–5 describe fire as an ever-more dangerous substance. Though in verse 2 the danger is confined and contrasted with  the poets’ successful productions, the following verses give free rein to the destruc  
tive power of wildfire with vivid descriptions of its progress through the land. The final two verses, in a different meter, append a magical charm, to banish  dangerous fire from the land and make that land the abode of water and plants. The Anukramaṇī identifies “the four Śārṅgas” as the poets of the hymn. This is  an allusion to an episode in the Mahābhārata (Śārṅgopākhyānam, MBh I.220–25),  

in which four birds, sons of an ascetic, are spared by Agni during the otherwise  complete burning of the Khāṇḍava Forest. This tale almost certainly postdates the  composition of our hymn.
