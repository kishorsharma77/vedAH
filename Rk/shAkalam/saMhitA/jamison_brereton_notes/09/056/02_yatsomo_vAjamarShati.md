This vs. consists entirely of a dependent cl. and can most conveniently be attached to the preceding vs. As noted above I take pl. dhā́rā apasyúvaḥ as a nom. in apposition to sg. sómaḥ. Re explicitly calls it an “Acc. interne,” tr. “(en) cent jets actifs,” but internal to what? Ge’s tr. is similar to Re’s, but he doesn’t commit himself as to case. That dhā́rāḥ is definitely nom. in the next hymn, IX.57.1, also with vā́jam as goal, gives some support to my interpr. here.

āviśán in c is most likely the nom. sg. pres. part. it is universally interpr. as (incl. in the publ. tr.), modifying sómaḥ in a. However, it is technically possible that it is a 3rd pl.

injunc. ā-viśán with the pl. dhā́rāḥ of b as its subj. It would be accented on the verb stem because it is still part of the yád clause. This would anchor dhā́rāḥ as nom. and produce a tr.

“When Soma rushes towards the prize (and) (his) hundred hardworking streams enter fellowship with Indra.” I do not advocate for this interpr., which seems too fussy, but I do point out that nothing in the grammar of the vs. precludes it.
