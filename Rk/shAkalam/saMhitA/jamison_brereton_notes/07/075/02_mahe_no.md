Like the āvaḥ forms (see vs. 1), bodhi is ambiguous, and either interpr.

could be made to fit the context. Gr takes it to √budh ‘be aware, be awake’, but most later interpr. assign it to √bhū (Old, Ge, Re, Lub). However, I opt for √budh for several reasons. For one thing, as I have shown elsewhere (1997 “Syntactic Constraints on Morphological Change,” 69-74), bodhi to √bhū is in virtual complementary distribution with the parallel impv. bháva, with bodhi confined to pāda-medial position, against bháva, which occurs initially and finally. A pāda-final bodhi here would violate this distributional rule. Moreover, the last word of the preceding vs. is ajīgaḥ, belonging to √gṛ ‘awaken’, and I think the poet is playing off these two ‘awaken’ roots. Although Old gives numerous supposed parallels with √bhū and the syntactic construction in our pāda, most of these involve dat. infinitives.

However, two give me pause — III.54.3 mahé ṣú ṇaḥ suvitā́ya prá bhūtam, VII.85.4 ásad ít sá suvitā́ya … — both of which contain the dat. suvitā́ya and a form of ‘be(come)’. On the basis of these passages, I admit the possibility that bodhi here belongs to √bhū, but still think it likely that the poet is slyly playing with the ‘awaken’ roots. If it does belong to √bhū, I would explain its wrong positioning on the basis of strict parallelism between the semantically and syntactically parallel clauses of a and b, with the latter ending with the impf. (prá) yandhi.

Ge and Re construe márteṣu with śravasyúm (“… Reichtum, der unter den Sterblichen nach Ruhm strebt”; “… la richesse … qui crée le renom parmi les mortels,” with Re adding a “creative” dimension to śravasyú- that does not seem to me to be justified, though it makes the tr. make more sense). I think rather that the sequence dévi márteṣu mānuṣi is meant to draw attention to two different relationships that Dawn, a goddess, has with the human world: on the one hand, she 98 comes among mortals (márteṣu) every day, awakening the whole human world; on the other, she has a special relationship with the descendents of Manu, that is, the Ārya sacrificial community, a much more restricted set of humans to whom she is more tightly bound by ritual activity.
