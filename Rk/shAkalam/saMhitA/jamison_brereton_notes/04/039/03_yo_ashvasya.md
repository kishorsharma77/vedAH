The interpretive problem in this vs. is caused by the length of a single vowel: sá instead of *sā́in d. The most obvious contextual reading of the pāda is that Aditi should act in concert with Mitra and Varuṇa, but of course Aditi is feminine and the pronoun is masc. Sāy. makes Dadhikrā the referent and is followed by Ge, Re, Maurer, and (tentatively, see their n.) WG. (Maurer in fact takes Dadhikrā also as the subj. of kṛṇotu in c and interprets áditiḥ as a masc. adj. ‘free of bond’.) Old discusses at some length and comes to a solution (in agreement with Hillebrandt) somewhat like Maurer’s: that the subject of both c and d is Dadhikrā in the guise of / identified with Aditi. I find all this unlikely; despite the syntactic problem, I think the subject of d has to be Aditi, who has a close natural connection with her sons Mitra and Varuṇa (unlike Dadhikrā). Masc. sá may simply show attraction to the adj.

sajóṣāḥ, which is ambig. between masc. and fem. Or, in my opinion more likely, the pāda may have been incompletely adapted from one in which the referent of sá was Aryaman, the standard third member of this trio. No exact parallel is found in the RV, but cf. passages like I.90.1, I.186.2=VII.60.4 and, with Aditi, VI.51.5 and V.31.5.

Another possibility, that the sá refers to the mortal poet favored by Aditi in c, was essentially closed off by Old, who persuasively argues that sajóṣa(s)- refers almost without exception to the relationship of gods with gods or, less frequently, mortals with mortals -- but not interspecies relationships, as it were.
