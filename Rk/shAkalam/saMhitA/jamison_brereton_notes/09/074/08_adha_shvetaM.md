This is the triumphant realization of the quest set in motion in vs. 1. The race horse (vājī́) of 1b reappears here having won (sasavā́n) at the finish line (kā́rṣman) what it was seeking to win (síṣāsati) there - namely the milk, here given a very full expression: śvetáṃ [recurring from 7a] kaláśaṃ góbhir aktám “the gleaming white tub anointed with cows.” This first hemistich plus pāda c is the actual end of the hymn, and so this successful resolution of vs. 1 provides a thematic ring. Pāda c reintroduces the human ritual personnel, who propel Soma in his guise as racehorse—thus allowing the priest-poets to take some credit for the successful conclusion of the sacrifice, after having been shut out for most of the hymn. Pāda d is a snatch of a dānastuti, and vs. 9 seems an afterthought tacked onto the hymn. Or such is my analysis; most of the other tr. attempt to link the second hemistich with the first, syntactically and thematically. Most radically Ge (fld. by Doniger), who makes d dependent on sasavā́n in b, with c a parenthetical intrusion. Maurer, by contrast, makes d the obj.

of c, which does less violence to the order of elements but is still, to my mind, unsatisfactory. Among other things soma is the usual object of √hi in IX, which contains multiple exx., and so making the cows (somehow) the object violates formulaic expectations. Cf. esp. IX.106.11 hinvanti vājínam, with soma identified as a vājín as here.

It is easy to understand the attempts of others to link d with something else in the vs., because it consists only of a dative phrase (kakṣī́vate śatáhimāya) and a gen. pl. (gónām). However, as I just remarked, this pāda seems to be an abbreviated dānastuti, with the dāna specified and no stuti given, but the poet and would-be recipient emphatically named. In such circumstances condensed phraseology is not surprising. Ge appositely cites as parallel I.126.2 śatáṃ kakṣī́vān ásurasya gónām “A hundred cows of the lord (have I,) Kakṣīvant, (taken).” In our passage the “hundred” is cleverly tucked into the adj. śatáhima-, which otherwise presumably expresses Kakṣīvant’s proleptic wish for a 100-year lifespan; it seems unlikely that he is already that old.
