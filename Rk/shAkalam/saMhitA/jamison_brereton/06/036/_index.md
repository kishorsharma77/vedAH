Indra  
Nara Bhāradvāja  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
An unqualified celebration of Indra’s complete power and his control of all beings  and things, both earthly and heavenly. It is hoped that the peoples’ offerings to  

Indra, the soma (vs. 1), the sacrificial offerings (vs. 2), and the songs (vs. 3), will  provoke answering generosity (vs. 4). This reciprocal relationship is economically  expressed in the last half of verse 5.
