Agni  
Gāthin Kauśika  
5 verses: triṣṭubh 1, 4; anuṣṭubh 2–3; satobr̥hatī 5  
Oldenberg judges this to be not so much a hymn as a collection of verses composed  in various meters. In his earlier translation of the Agni hymns, however, he does494 III.22  
note that at least the last two verses “seem to form a distich of an irregular pragātha  type.” On the other hand, Geldner observes that TB III 6.7 includes the whole of  the hymn in the animal sacrifice among the stokīyā verses that accompany the drip ping fat from the vapā, the omentum, while it is being roasted, and Elizarenkova  (1995: 116) further proposes that the different meters of the verses reflect the irregu lar rhythm of the drops as they fall. Whether it originated as a verse collection or it  constitutes a unified composition, the hymn does center on the dripping fat of an  animal sacrifice. The hymn mentions médas “fat” in every verse but one, and even  puns on médas in verse 4 by referring to Agni as médhira “wise.”
