Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Like the previous hymn, this one is tied to the here-and-now of the ritual situation;  also like the previous hymn, this one plays games with reference. The subject of the  hymn is really soma, but the word “soma” does not appear in it, and in the middle  verses of the hymn, which are insistently about soma, the poet intentionally mis  
leads us about the referent.  
In verse 1 a long series of adjectives in the genitive describing an unidentified being  is resolved by the verb “you have drunk”—the subject is Indra, and the genitive ref erent must be soma. The three middle verses (2–4) form an omphalos defined by  the repeated near deictic “this one here.” This pronoun should have a referent in the  immediate vicinity of the poet, but the first of these verses concerns what is clearly the  Vala myth, which invites the audience to supply Indra as the subject. It is only as the  sequence unfolds (and especially with the specification of “this one” as a “drop” in vs.  3) that it becomes clear that soma is taking the role of Indra is these verses.  
For a similar covert coding of soma, there by the use of the genitive pronoun  asya “of it, of this one” see VI.27.1–2.
