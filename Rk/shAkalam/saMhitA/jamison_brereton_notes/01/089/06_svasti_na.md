The rigid parallel structure of the four pādas is resolved by the final word of the verse dadhātu, which verb must be supplied for the first three pādas. This rigid structure, svastí naḥ GOD EPITHET, also allows the metrical irregularity of the first two pādas to be kept under strict control. Under HvN’s interpretation each of those two pādas has a rest after the s u vastí naḥ opening, with the GOD EPITHET phrase taking the rest of the line. Old suggests reading trisyllabic indi ra, as often, as well as pū̂ṣā́, with distracted ū. The former seems more likely than the latter, but because of the parallelism of a and b in HvN’s reading, I prefer theirs.
