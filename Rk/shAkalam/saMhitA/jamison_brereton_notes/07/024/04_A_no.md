The intens. part. várīvṛjat can only be intransitive here, as there is nothing overt or latent that could serve as object (so also Ge “zu uns einbiegend,” Schaeffer [191] “immer wieder (zu uns) einbiegend” -- though with a different nuance from my 28 tr.). However, forms to the root √vṛj ‘twist’ are otherwise always transitive, including the other ex. of the intens. part. (VI.58.2). I do not have an explanation.
