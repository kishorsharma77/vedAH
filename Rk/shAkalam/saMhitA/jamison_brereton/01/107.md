All Gods
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
3 verses: triṣṭubh
The first verse of this brief and elementary hymn continues the theme of “broad  space out of narrowness” found in the refrain of the previous hymn.
## 1
The sacrifice goes toward the benevolence of the gods: o Ādityas, become  compassionate.254 I.108
Your benevolent thought, inclined our way, should turn you hither—that  which will be excellent at finding a wide place even out of narrow
straits.
## 2
Let the gods come close to us here with help, being praised with the  melodies of the Aṅgirases.
Indra with his Indrian powers, the Maruts with the Maruts, Aditi with  the Ādityas will extend shelter to us.
## 3
In this of ours shall Indra take delight, in this shall Varuṇa, in this Agni,  in this shall Aryaman, in this Savitar take delight.
– This let Mitra and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and  Heaven.
