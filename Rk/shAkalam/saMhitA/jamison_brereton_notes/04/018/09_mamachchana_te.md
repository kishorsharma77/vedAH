As indicated in the publ. intro., the contents of this vs. and the reason for its inclusion in this hymn are both deeply obscure, though the occurrence of the rare stem agrū́- ‘unwed girl’ in 7a may have prompted the inclusion of the bizarre anecdote in 9ab. As Ge's reff. for ab show, the shunned son of a maiden, the blind man, and the lame man are mentioned together in II.13.12, 15.7, I.112.8; also IV.30.16, 19. So, however ill-assorted, this is a set. The unfortunate son of an agrū́is also mentioned in nearby IV.30.16, though there he is only shunned, not eaten by ants.

On ukhachíd- see Scar (131).

Unfortunately I have nothing further to say about the sense of this vs. I have toyed with the possibility that there’s a ritual reference here, to the taking out of the offering fire from the householder’s fire and its removal to the east. But, though there might be rough correspondence -- very rough -- between the first and third parts, the middle part with the blind man and the snake doesn't work at all, as far as I can see.
