As discussed in the publ. intro., this hymn is unified by a simple device, the nom. sg.

m. prn/pronominal adj. eṣá ‘this (one)’ that opens each vs. The first three vss. (and vs. 5) begin eṣá deváḥ; in a further two vss. (7, 8) the 2nd word divám is, of course, etymologically related to devá- and a phonological variant (i for e in the initial syllable). Only vss. 4, 6, 9, and 10 stand aside from this pattern -- and 6 and 9 have deváḥ in their 2nd pādas. The final vs., 10, opens eṣá u syá “this one here, this very one,” producing an emphatic summary with the addition of a 2nd prn.

As was also noted in the publ. intro., the maṇḍala’s signature word ‘purify oneself’ is also omnipresent in this hymn, esp. the nom. sg. pres. part. pávamāna- ‘purifying himself’, which opens the pāda in vss. 2(c), 3(b), 4(c), 5(b), 7(c), 8(c); pavítre is found (mid-pāda) in 9, and once again vs. 10 marks a change and a summary, by using the finite form pavate (mid-c). Only vss. 1 and 6 lack a form of √pū. It might be worthy of note (if we understood how this maṇḍala had been assembled) that this flurry of repetitions is the first appearance of the part. pávamāna- in this maṇḍala. The over-abundance of forms of √pū may balance the lack of any overt mention of sóma-.

It can also be noted that the hymn is entirely in the 3rd ps.
