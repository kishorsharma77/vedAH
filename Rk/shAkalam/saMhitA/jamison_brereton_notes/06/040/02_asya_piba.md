In the 2nd hemistich the series of subjects -- the cows, the men, the waters, and the stone -- detail the various elements, both animate and not, that collaborate to produce the soma: the cows as the milk to be mixed in, the men who perform the pressing and the other ritual actions, the waters that both swell the soma stalk and are mixed with the pressed juices, and the stone used to press the stalks.

As Ge notes (n. 2cd) the final asmai has two possible readings: it can double te in c, “for you … for that one [=you] to drink,” or it can refer to soma, appearing earlier in the clause in the acc. phrase tám … índum “this drop.” I favor the latter, with dat. asmai attracted into the dat. as complement of the dat. infin. pītáye (as subj., as in the publ. tr. “for it to be fully drunk,” or as obj. with te as subj. “for you to drink it fully”). Because the infinitive phrase pītáye sám asmai is separated from the rest of the clause and repeats the preverb/adverb sám, I favor the former. The use of the near-deictic asmai for soma, even unaccented, recalls the insistent ayám for soma in the preceding hymn (vss. 2-4; see comm. ad loc.), and it also forms a little ring in this vs., with init. ásya (2a) having the same referent as asmai at the end of 2d.
