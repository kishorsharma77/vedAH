The use of bhrā́tṛvya-, lit. ‘nephew, cousin’, as ‘rival’ is exceedingly common in Vedic prose, but only really begins in the AV; this is the only such example in the RV. The passage here seems to be an expansion, with lexical renewal, of I.102.8 aśatrúr indra janúṣā sanād asi “You are without rival, Indra, by birth from of old,” but I would also suggest that the use of an explicit kinship term a-bhrātṛvyá (as opposed to the generic a-śatrú-) is deliberate, given the web of relationships the poet develops in this hymn (see publ. intro.) It is possible that -bhrātṛvya- here is meant to be taken in both the negative sense that is standard later (rival < rivalrous nephew/cousin) and in a positive one, simply naming a blood relation. Thus the hemistich could mean both “you have no nephew and no friend” and “you have no rival but no friend”). As a kinship term abhrātṛvyá- would contrast with the bándhumant- of 4a, where Indra is explicitly credited with having kin.
