Although mṛgá- generally refers to a wild beast in general in the RV and in later Skt. comes to mean specifically ‘deer’, here it seems close to the meaning of Aves. mǝrǝγa- ‘(large) bird, bird of prey’. Cf. the almost identical pāda IX.67.15 śyenó ná taktó arṣati “Like a falcon launched in flight, it rushes.” The participle avacā́kaśat ‘looking down’ also fits a bird better than an earth-bound beast; cf. esp. X.136.4 antárikṣeṇa patati víśvā rūpā́vacā́kaśat “He flies through the midspace, gazing down on all forms,” in the famous Muni hymn. See also comm. on takva-vī́- ad I.134.5, 151.5. It must be admitted, however, that it is not only birds that √tac; see X.28.4 kroṣṭā́varāháṃ nír atakta kákṣāt “The jackal sprang on the boar from out of the underbrush.” However, there the attack is presumably an airborne pounce, so bird-like. Images on the web of jackals pouncing support this notion.

As for what the mṛgá- is looking down on, it is surely the two worlds, a notion going back to Sāy., which would fit the bird’s-eye view. Ge suggests other possibilities in n. 4a, but not with great conviction.
