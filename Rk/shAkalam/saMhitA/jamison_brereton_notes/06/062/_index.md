Aśvins The first part of the hymn is marked by repeated dual prns. opening the vs. or hemistich: 1c yā́, 2a, 3a, 4a, 5a tā́, 5c yā́, 6a tā́. This pattern more or less coincides with the division of the hymn discussed in the publ. intro. After the beg. of vs. 6 the pattern is broken and does not reappear.
