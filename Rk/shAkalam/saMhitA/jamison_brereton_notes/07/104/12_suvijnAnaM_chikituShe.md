The prim. comp. ṛ́jīyas- here (=AVŚ VIII.4.12; also in AVŚ V.14.12), to ṛjú- ‘straight’, should of course have a full-grade root syllable *rájīyas-, like the superlative rájiṣṭha (RV 7x, = Aves. razišta-). Re plausibly suggests that it has adopted the root syllable of the base adjective -- though why other primary comparatives and superlatives tolerate root ablaut is not addressed. It’s worth noting that if we were to restore the expected form, it would fix a problematic cadence (yatarád *rájīyaḥ ß ṛ́jīyaḥ), by producing a heavy syllable four syllables from the end. As it is, the cadence is ⏑ ⏑ - ×, rather than expected - ⏑ - ×. I am reluctant to emend, however, since it is not clear how the erroneous zero-grade would have been introduced.
