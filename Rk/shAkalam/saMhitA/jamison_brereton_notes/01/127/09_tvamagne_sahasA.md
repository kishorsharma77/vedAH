The hapax splv. sáhantama- does not require the positing (with Gr) of an otherwise unattested n-stem sáhan-. A nonce derivation from the pres. part. sáhant- (with simplification of the cluster sáhan(t)-tama-, with AiG II.2.597, etc.) is certainly possible, and the full grade with nasal might have been constructed as a partial match for its parallels śuṣmíntama- and dyumníntama-.

I.127.9-10: The ends of both a-pādas are variants of each other: 9a … sáhasā sáhantamaḥ, 10a … sáhasā sáhasvate, each following a metrical rest.
