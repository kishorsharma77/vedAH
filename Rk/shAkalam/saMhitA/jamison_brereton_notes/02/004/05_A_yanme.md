This vs. describes the changes in color and form of the kindled fire as a sight to be wondered at. My tr. follows Ge’s in outline and many details. The first sight is of the shapeless dark cloud of smoke (a), but that transforms into color and bright light (bc). On ábhva- see my forthcoming “The Blob in Ancient India” (UCLA CMRS 2015 dragon conf. vol.), and for a parallel passage (also adduced by Ge) VI.4.3 … yásya panáyanty ábhvam, bhā́sāṃsi vaste sū́ryo ná śukráh “He whose formless mass [=smoke] they [=mortals] marvel at …, he (then) clothes himself in lights, like the brilliant sun,” which seems to show parallel progress from dark to light and also contains a form of bhās- as here.

vanád- ‘wood-eater’ assumes a root noun 1st member ván-, preserved in a few forms such as loc. pl. váṃsu (see Schindler, Rt. Noun), against the overwhelming number of forms to thematic vána-.

I do not understand the simile in b, uśígbhyo ná “as if for the fire-priests.” Perhaps the point is that the fire-tending performed by Uśij-priests would cause the smoke to dissipate and the flames to appear, but that in their absence this change comes about anyway. Note that in X.46.2, quoted above ad vs. 2, the Bhṛgus seem to be identified as uśíj-priests, so the simile here may be referring to ritual behavior in ancestral time. WG tr. “wie den (danach) Verlangenden,” but uśíj- is elsewhere the designation of a priest (and cf. Old Aves. usij-) and is so tr. by them elsewhere (e.g., I.60.4).

For ráṃsu as adverbial loc. pl. to the root noun ráṇ- see Schindler Rt. Noun and EWA, both s.v. raṇ. And note raṇvá- in the preceding and following vss. (4a, 6c).

The last pāda describes the graying of the ash (“having grown old”) and then the rejuvenation of the flames presumably by the addition of more firewood.
