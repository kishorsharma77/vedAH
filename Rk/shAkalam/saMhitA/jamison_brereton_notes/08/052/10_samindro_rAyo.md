I don’t really understand the idiom sám √dhū ‘shake together’. Its intent seems to be ‘produce, create’, but the semantic mechanism is unclear to me. It’s possible that sám occurs with √dhū here only because of the sám in the second hemistich. A straight ‘shake out’ or ‘shake loose’ could more easily develop to ‘produce, create’. Though cf. sám √dhū in I.10.8 (where I do tr. ‘shake loose’).

In pāda a rā́yo bṛhatī́ḥ seems to require rayí- to be fem., as occasionally elsewhere (but not so often as generally thought). I wonder, however, if the bṛhatī́ḥ has been borrowed from 9c: pūrvī́r ṛtásya bṛhatī́r anūṣata, which is structured in parallel to 10a sám índro rā́yo bṛhatī́r adhūnuta. It is even possible that bṛhatī́ḥ in 10a doesn’t modify rā́yaḥ but refers to the same object as found in 9c (“lofty songs” vel sim.). This might solve the just-discussed problem of sám √dhū: perhaps there are two objects of “shake together” -- something like “shook together riches and lofty (songs).”
