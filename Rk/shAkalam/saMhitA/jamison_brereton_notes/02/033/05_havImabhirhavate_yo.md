I am in agreement with most tr. (though not Macd.) that pāda b is the thought of the subject of the rel. cl. in pāda a, namely the over-zealous sacrificer. The verb áva … diṣīya belongs not with √dā ‘give’ (with Gr), but √dā ‘cut, divide’ (so already Wh Roots); see esp. Narten (Sig Aor. 138-40). The idiom áva √dā is generally taken, including by Narten, to mean ‘abfinden’ (propitiate, compensate), but I think it has a more literal meaning here, ‘cut off’. The too-little ritual service of vs. 4 -- poor praise (dúṣṭuti-) and shared invocation (sáhūti-) -- meets the contrasting fault in vs. 5: the over-eager worshiper who wants Rudra as his own exclusively. This is a dramatic opposite of the sáhūti-; not only an invocation directed only to this god, but one not jointly produced by the group of priests and worshippers. Such a private oneon-one human-divine relationship would be quite anomalous in the RVic religious world, where divine service requires cooperation among various ritual personnel.

The personal appeals in the Vasiṣṭha-Varuṇa hymns of VII have such a strong impact in part because they deviate so far from ordinary religious practice.

The standard interpr. of the second hemistich makes the main clause rather loosely attached to the rel. cl. of pāda a. The “us” (naḥ) of c is supposed to pick up the yáḥ of a and the manā́- of d is supposed to refer rather vaguely to the sentiment expressed in ab: in other words, we don’t want to be the sort of person who might think such a thing or be suspected of thinking such a thing. I think the connection is much simpler. manā́- is generally ‘zeal’ or ‘enthusiasm’; it is not inherently a negative notion, but becomes negative in the wrong hands (or mind). In my interpr., the “whoever” of the rel. cl. in a is our sacrificial rival, who is trying to cut us out of the deal, as it were, by getting Rudra to himself. We beg Rudra not to make us subject to, subordinate to, his over-zealous action.

The epithet ṛdūdára- ‘tender-hearted’ is a charming phonetic play on Rudra’s name, which is almost always read trisyllabically (rudara) in this hymn.

Another adj. (see 3b above) otherwise used (almost) exclusively of Indra: suśípra- ‘well-lipped’ (of Agni V.22.4; in pl. of Ṛbhukṣans VII.37.1).
