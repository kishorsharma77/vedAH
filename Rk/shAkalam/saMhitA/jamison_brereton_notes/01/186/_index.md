All Gods As noted in the publ. intro., the hymn is knit together by a shifting pattern of repeated initial preverbs and particles: 1a / 2a ā́(with ápi 1c), úpa 4a, which morphs into utá 5a, 6a, 7a, 8a -- the last 3 with utá na īm -- followed by prá 9a, 9b, 10a, 10b (which was anticipated by pṛ́... 8c. For the prá-s note 9a prá nú, 9b prá yu(...), 10 prá ū, 10b pra pū(...). Vs. 11 falls outside the picture. The repeated utá-s of vss. 5-8 reinforce the frequent additive quality of Viśve Devāḥ hymns.
