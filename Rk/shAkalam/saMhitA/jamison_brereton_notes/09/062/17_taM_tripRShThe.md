See publ. intro. for the ritual specificity of the images in this vs. The participle “yoking” in the publ. tr. of c should properly be in parens., since it’s simply generated from the finite yuñjanti in b.

The uninflected numeral ‘seven’ (saptá) is stationed between two pl. nouns, gen. ṛ́ṣīṇāṃ ‘of the seers’ and instr. dhītíbhiḥ ‘with visionary thoughts’. Of course seven is the canonical number of seers throughout Indian religious history, starting with the RV, but ‘seven’ is also used of dhītí- in IX.9.4 sá saptá dhītíbhir hitáḥ and passages cited there. Most tr. choose to construe it with one or the other (Ge, Ober [II.72] ṛ́ṣi-; Re, Lü [710], Ober [II.222] dhītí-), with, surprisingly (to me), more going for dhītí- than ṛ́ṣi-. But surely its position helps signal that it should be construed with both (as Re in his n. and Ober in his 2nd tr. indicate).
