Pāda c has been variously dealt with -- as parenthetical (Ge), as a separate clause (Re, WG), as the obj. of the verb in d (Old). All of these take the two gods as the subj. of the part. cakrāṇā́(flg. the du. reading of the Pp., cakrāṇaú), and all of them fail to render the medial sense of the part. Since the med. pf. cakré in 2a has clear medial sense (“made X his own”), the voice of this participle should not be ignored. I therefore read it as nom. plural (contra Pp. but compatible with Saṃhitā), modifying the 1st pl. subj. of ab. Again, we want to make the gods our own; this forms a ring with the same usage in 2a.
