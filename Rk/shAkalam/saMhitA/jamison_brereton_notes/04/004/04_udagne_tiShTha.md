As Ge suggests in his n. 4a, ā́tanuṣva could reflect the common idiom ā́√tan ‘draw/stretch (the bow [dhánus-, dhánvan-])’. Given that Agni is identified as a ‘shooter’ (ástā) in 1c and that bows are the presumed object of a different form of √tan in the next vs. (5c, see there), this seems quite possible, though I think the primary reading is simply the reflexive ‘stretch yourself out’; cf. 1a for Agni’s making himself broad.
