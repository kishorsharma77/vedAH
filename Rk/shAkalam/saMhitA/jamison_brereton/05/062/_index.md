Mitra and Varuṇa
Śrutavid Ātreya
9 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn calls on Mitra and Varuṇa for rain, as 3cd makes clear. Their ability  to send the rain is connected with their kingship, and the poet suggests that con nection in several images. The gods’ throne sits “within the libations” (vss. 5, 6),  which not only are the oblations made to them but also signify the rainwater. The  banner that increases through their commandment (vs. 5)  is the banner “of the  ruler” (cf. V.69.1), and here the rain is the emblem of their kingship. Their rule is  strong, supported by a thousand pillars (vs. 6), but the pillar of their throne is also  the lightning (vs. 7ab) that accompanies the rain, and its foundation is in land that  yields plants (vs. 7c).
Framing the rain, which is the subject of verses 2–7, is the sun (vss. 1, 8). The first  verse remains mysterious. The first hemistich places Mitra and Varuṇa’s “enduring  truth” in the night sky or in any case, in that place where “they,” most likely the  gods generally, unhitch Sūrya’s horses to let them pasture during the night. Yet even  before dawn the poet’s vision allows him to see “that One,” the sun, and together  with the sun, the hidden truth of the two gods. The sun may also be the “single  felly” mentioned in 2d, and if so, the verse looks forward the appearance of the sun  after the rain. After the invocations to the gods for rain, the sun returns to the poem  once again, this time visible to all at dawn and closely associated with the golden  throne of Mitra and Varuṇa.
