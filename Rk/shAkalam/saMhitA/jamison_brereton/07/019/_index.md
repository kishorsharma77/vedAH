Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The first half of this hymn (vss. 1–5) celebrates various victories of Indra, giving  aid both to men of the mythic past (e.g., Kutsa, vs. 2) and those of the present,  especially King Sudās (vss. 3, also 6), the leader also in the Battle of the Ten Kings  treated in the preceding, well-known hymn (VII.18). The allegiances and enmities  of that hymn are strikingly different here: for example, Indra helps the Pūru king in  this hymn (vs. 3), whereas in VII.18 the Pūrus are the enemy.
Beginning with verse 6 we attempt to mobilize the powers and protection that  Indra has previously provided for us, and as usual we offer praise in return.
