Br̥haspati
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
3 verses: triṣṭubh
In this brief hymn Br̥haspati is credited with many of Indra’s exploits and is  described with Indraic vocabulary. It is only in the very last word of the hymn “with  his chants” (arkaíḥ) that the particular character of Br̥haspati and his particular  role in the opening of the Vala cave, that of singer and formulator, are referred to. 1. He who is splitter of the stone, first born, possessed of truth—Br̥haspati  Āṅgirasa, possessing the oblation—
(*filling) the doubly exalted earth, sitting in front of the heated pot, our  father the bull keeps bellowing to the two world-halves.
## 2
Br̥haspati, who even for such a man (as me) has made wide space at the  invocation to the gods,
smashing obstacles, he keeps splitting apart the strongholds, conquering  rivals, overcoming enemies in battles.
## 3
Br̥haspati entirely conquered goods; this god conquered the great  enclosures full of cattle.
When he sets out to win the waters and the sun, Br̥haspati is
unopposable. He smites the foe with his chants.
