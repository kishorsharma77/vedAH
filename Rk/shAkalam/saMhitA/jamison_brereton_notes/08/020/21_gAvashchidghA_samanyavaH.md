The cow imagery of vs. 19 (and implicitly 20) continues here. Ge and Re take this as a simile (“like cows”), but this requires interpr. cid as a simile marker, a function for cid that I do not believe in. It is even less likely because the next verse begins with a parallel structure (mártaś cid), where the cid is definitely not a simile marker. I do, however, think that the Maruts are identified with the cows here. There are several themes intertwined. The most obvious point of comparison between cows and Maruts is their common birth (sajātyèna … sábandhavaḥ) as a herd/flock and consequent lack of individual differentiation, a characteristic of the Maruts treated earlier, in vss. 13-14. But the Maruts also have a cow for a mother; this was asserted in 8c, and the phraseology there (góbandhavaḥ sujātā́saḥ “akin to a cow, well-born”) is echoed here (gā́vaḥ … sajātyèna … sábandhavaḥ), thus alluding to the Maruts’ kinship with cows. Hence sábandhu- here has two senses: both cows and Maruts have common birth within their own group (that is, cows with cows, Maruts with Maruts), but cows and Maruts have a common birth with each other (cows with Maruts, due to the Maruts’ bovine mother). This type of kinship is treated also in 22ab. I also identified a secondary meaning in 8c: being akin to cows is a way of saying that the Maruts have cows to give, and I think that is slightly hinted at here.

I don’t quite understand the relevance of “they lick each other’s humps.” Lü (Varuṇa 90) suggests that the vs. praises the unity (Eintract) of the Maruts, and, if somewhat sharpened, this may be the correct explanation. “Lick each other’s humps” may be the equivalent of English “watch each other’s backs”: individuals act reciprocally (mitháḥ here) and protectively for the common good of the group.

Note the echo of the final words in a and b: … samanyavaḥ# … sábandhavaḥ#. The opening gā́vaś cid ghā also faintly echoes gā́ya gā́opening 21a.
