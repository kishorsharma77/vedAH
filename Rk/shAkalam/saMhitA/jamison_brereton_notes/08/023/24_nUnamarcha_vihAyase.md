The hapax sthūrayūpavát may be a pun. On the one hand, formations of this sort, with neut. -vát suffix, generally mean ‘like X’, ‘as X did’, with X a PN. The presence of an undoubted ex. in the same position in the immediately preceding vs., vyaśvavát ‘like Vyaśva’, strongly supports this interpr. The poet addressed by the impv. arca is being urged to chant ‘like Sthūrayūpa’. Gr and Re interpr. the form thus. But sthūrayūpa- also has lexical meaning, ‘(having?) sturdy posts’ (in the absence of accent we cannot tell whether the cmpd is a bahuvrīhi or a karmadhāraya).

The yūpa is both the post to which the animal to be sacrificed is tethered and a crucial post or beam in the construction of dwellings. In this lexical meaning the comparison could either be between the praise songs and sturdy posts or someone who possesses them, or between Agni and the post or post-possessor. Note that it is Agni dámya- (‘of the household’) who receives the chant. If the comparison is to the praise songs, they would be conceptualized as the uprights that help make the house solid. The parallel adduced by Ge, I.51.14 … stómo dúryo ná yū́paḥ “a praise-song like a door-post,” is particularly apt. This is the sense reflected in my tr. and also in Ge’s and assumes a karmadhāraya. If the comparison is to Agni, a bahuvrīhi would be better: “to Agni of the household, like one [=a house] having sturdy posts.” The kinship asserted between Agni and trees in the next verse may give some support to this last interpr.
