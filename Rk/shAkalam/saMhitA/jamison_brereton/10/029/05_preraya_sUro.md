As the sun sends (each man) forth to his task, do you send forth, (like a  boat) to the further shore, those who go, each to his own desire, as if  going to the providers of wives,  
and those men who seek to empower their many hymns for you,  
powerfully born Indra, along with their (offerings of) food.
