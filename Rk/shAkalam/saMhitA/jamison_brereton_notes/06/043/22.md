As just noted, índuḥ ‘drop’ opening pāda b firmly identifies the subject as Soma, but the common word play between phonologically similar índu- and índra-, found esp. in Maṇḍala IX, underlines the permeable boundary just noted between Indra and Soma in this tṛca.

The brief narrative allusion in pāda c (“stole the weapons of his own father”) sounds like a fractured version of the just-born Indra stealing the soma from Tvaṣṭar, but it is hard to know how to square that tale with this formulation.
