Assuming a thematic stem áṅgira- here is unavoidable, next to the far more common s-stem áṅgiras-.

In order to give ā́d its usual temporal reading (“just after that”), I follow Old in assuming that pāda b provides the grounds for the Aṅgirases’ acquisition of lifeforce.

The standard tr. (Ge, Re, WG) take prathamám … váyaḥ as a syntagm (“first youth,” vel sim.), whereas I take prathamám as an adverb. Their evidence is VII.97.1 prathamáṃ váyaś ca, but there the position of ca favors separation of prathamám and váyaḥ. See comm. ad loc. Ge and Re supply a verb in d, but this seems unnecessary; the accusatives here can simply expand on bhójanam in c.
