The syntactic association of várasya is disputed; see Old’s discussion for various possibilities. I follow Ge in taking it as dependent on krátum.

It also seems necessary to supply a verb with ab. I import anūṣata from cd, with svā́hā the cry that the sacrificers cry out; however, Ge’s ‘entsprechen’, utilizing the preverb ánu present in pāda a, is also possible, though he must take svā́hā as a syntactic absolute (“unter Svāhāruf”).

Ge takes śvātrám as the content of the call (“… haben … den Drang eingeschrieen”), but √nu ordinarily takes as object the being towards whom the cry is directed, and I therefore take śvātrám as referring to Indra. (This standard construction of √nu does make some trouble for my interpretation of svā́hā as construed with supplied √nu in ab, but perhaps the fact that svā́hā expresses the cry itself makes the difference. See comm. on I.6.6, however.) Note the phonological echoes: ā́(d ū) nú … ánu (a) / anūṣata (c).
