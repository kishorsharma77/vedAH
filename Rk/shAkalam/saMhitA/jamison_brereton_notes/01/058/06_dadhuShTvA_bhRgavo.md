The last halves of the two hemistichs are parallel and complementary, referring to humans and gods respectively: b: … jánebhyaḥ# / d: … divyā́ya jánmane# In c mitrám is of course ambiguous: it can refer simply to the god of that name (so Re), but more likely is at least a pun on the meaning of the common noun ‘ally’. Agni is often so called because he serves as go-between between gods and men.
