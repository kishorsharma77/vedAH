I do not understand the double íti of pāda c. But I assume that the “two” in this pāda refers to the two differently identified káṅkata- in ab, the one that is not (really) a káṅkata and the one that is a true (satīna-) káṅkata-. These are then reidentified as plúṣi-.

For the accent of adṛ́ṣta- see AiG II.1.226 and Nachtr. p. 66.
