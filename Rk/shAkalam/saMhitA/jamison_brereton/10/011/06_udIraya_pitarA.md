Rouse his [=Agni’s] two parents [=kindling sticks], (as) a lover (rouses) his  “piece of luck” [=girl]. The gladdening one [=Soma] is seeking to attain (the  cows?) and sends (speech) from his heart. The draft-horse [=Agni and/or Soma?] is speaking; the bounteous one  [=Agni?] is performing his work well. The lord [=Soma?] displays his  power; he trembles (in poetic inspiration) with his thought.
