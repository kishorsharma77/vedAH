The concentration of intensives continues in this verse: námnate (a), róruvat (b), davidhāva (d).

The ‘bending’ of pāda a of course describes the flickering motion of the flames.

Because of the theme mentioned ad vss. 6-8, of the bodily transformation of the plants by burning, I take tanvàs in c as referring to the bodies of the plants, not, with most tr., that of Agni.

I don’t entirely understand the position of ca in c. Klein (DGRV I.222-23, 259-60) suggests that it has been bumped by the participle opening the clause and pāda. It is certainly the case that ca could not immediately follow that first word without metrical distress: five-syllable ojāyámānaḥ entirely fills the opening, and since the caesura cannot precede an enclitic, placing ca after the participle would result in an opening of 6.
