Viśvāmitra Gāthina (1–15); Viśvāmitra or Jamadagni (16–18)
18 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, gāyatrī 4–18, arranged in trcas ̥
This, the last hymn in the maṇḍala, consists of eighteen verses, which should put  it out of sequence. However, it falls naturally into tr̥cas, and probably originally  consisted of six three-verse hymns dedicated severally to Indra and Varuṇa (1–3),  Br̥haspati (4–6), Pūṣan (7–9), Savitar (10–12), Soma (13–15), and Mitra and Varuṇa  (16–18).
In general the tr̥cas are relatively straightforward, even banal, but the first verse of  the first tr̥ca is rhetorically dense and striking in imagery. It seems to suggest that our  hymns, though they appear to be frenetically active, have lost their effectiveness, and  therefore Indra and Varuṇa have ceased to act on behalf of their humans praisers and  worshipers. It may not be entirely fanciful to conjecture that the simple, even simplis
tic, style of the remaining tr̥cas is an attempt to replace the “whirlwinds” of verbal  art (of which there is much in Maṇḍala III) with a meeker and less ostentatious style. The most notable feature of this hymn is the fact that the first verse of the  fourth tr̥ca, dedicated to Savitar (vs. 10), is the famous “Gāyatrī mantra,” with  which orthodox Hindus begin their morning worship even today. In the context  of R̥gvedic poetry, it must be said that the contents and form of this verse are not  particularly striking. As was just suggested, this may in fact be its point.
