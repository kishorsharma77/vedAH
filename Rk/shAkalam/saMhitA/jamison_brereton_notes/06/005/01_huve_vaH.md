I supply ‘our’ with ‘thoughts’ (matíbhiḥ) in pāda b, though the subject of the overt verb huvé is only 1st singular. I assume that the vaḥ ‘for you’ is addressed to the poet’s fellow celebrants and therefore there is an implicit 1st pl. It would, however, also be possible to tr. “with my thoughts.” ínvati is obviously a thematized Vth Class pres. (see Gotō, 1st class, p. 76).

What is rather surprising is that the athematic stem is found two vss. later, as inoṣi in 3c, as well as in the previous hymn (inóti VI.4.3; cf. also the impv. inuhí in nearby VI.10.7). It is true that ínvati provides a more favorable heavy syllable in 2nd position, but I do not otherwise see the motive for using both stems in this hymn.

Note the etymological connections yúvānam … yáviṣṭḥam, ádrogha(-vācam) … adhrúk, and (viśvá-)vārāṇi (puru)vā́raḥ.
