This vs. presents a double ambiguity. On the one hand cā́ru índrasya nā́ma can mean either “the dear name of Indra” (as Ge/Re take it) or “the name dear to Indra”; the question is whether the name Soma bears is “Indra,” as the first alternative implies, or “Soma,” with the second. I prefer the second, since constructing a plausible reason why Soma would be called Indra is difficult: Ge’s (n.

14) “er wirkt in Indra and führt so dessen Namen” doesn’t seem sufficient to me.

The second ambiguity is located in the 2nd hemistich and has two parts: what/who is the referent of yéna and who is the subj. of jaghā́na? The Ge/Re interpr.

seems to take the referent of yéna to be “the name Indra” and the subj. of the verb to be Soma (though neither is explicit about it). I recognize that this would be a pleasing paradox, since Indra is the default agent in this formula. But I wonder if instead Indra is the subj. of his signature verb, and yéna refers to soma, with the name equivalent to the substance.
