The temporal expression abhipitvé áhnām is universally taken as a reference to evening. In the RV dakṣiṇās are distributed at the morning sacrifice (hence their association with Dawn), though in classical śrauta ritual the time has changed to the midday rite. Perhaps Kakṣīvant knows an alternative practice, or he’s slyly indicating that the largesse was so enormous that it took all day to distribute. I favor the latter.
