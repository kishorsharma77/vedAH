The famous Somaraub, i.e., the stealing of Soma from heaven effected by a falcon and treated esp. (though obscurely) in IV.26-27, is rarely mentioned in Maṇḍala IX, as Ober (II.162) points out. Here it serves to bring the heavenly Soma to earth, to join with and super-charge the earthly, ritual Soma—the difference between the two Somas having been treated in vs. 5.

As noted in the publ. intro., the omphalos vs. 5 is encased in lexical rings.

Here vividuḥ responds to vivévidat in 3c (and both relate semantically to ví jijñatuḥ in the omphalos vs., 5c), aṃśúm (6d) and its semantic doublet ándhas (6b) to aṃśúḥ in 4c, pariyántam (6d) to pariyán (2c) (cf. also pariprayántam 8a), and suvṛ́dham (6c) to sākaṃvṛ́dham (3b).

In addition to lexical rings, there is chaining: 6c marjayanta is picked up by 7a mṛjanti (with no semantic or functional difference between the stems or the voices: marjayanta is an -anta replacement); 6a manīṣíṇaḥ ‘possessing inspired thoughts’ by 8b manīṣā́ḥ ‘inspired thoughts’.
