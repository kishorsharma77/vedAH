The two words making up the VP in d, ṛtám bharat, appear also in vs. 23, though not together (ṛtám ṛtā́ya b, bhāri d). As is pointed out by KH (implicitly: Injunc. 122 and esp. n. 34) and Ober (II.121), this appears to be an Indo-Iranian phrase, and it thus invests Soma with yet more traditional dignity. The pāda thus deserves a more solemn tr. than I gave it in the publ. tr. - perhaps “the drop bears the dear truth that is well worth the bearing.” Although the morphological means are different, the lexical duplication in both rayipátī rayīṇā́m (c) and ṛtám bharat súbhṛtam (d) gives the end of this tṛca a stately and archaic air.
