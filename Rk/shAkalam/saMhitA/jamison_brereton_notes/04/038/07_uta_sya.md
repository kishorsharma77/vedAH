On pāda b (=VII.19.2) see comm. on the latter passage. As discussed there, although the standard tr. (here Ge, Re, WG) take śúśrūṣamāṇaḥ as a form of √śruṣ ‘obey’ and tr. accordingly, it is simply a well-formed desiderative to √śru ‘hear / be heard/famed’ (so classified by Gr, Wh [Rts], Heenen), with the mid. meaning ‘desiring fame (for oneself), desiring to be(come) famed’. Pāda c contains another unidentified fem. loc. pl., the pres. part. yatī́ṣu. Old, Ge, and Re take the referent to be the ranks of chariots from 6b, WG cows. I again prefer mares (though the other two are possible, depending on how it is construed). I take the túram, the acc. sg. of a root noun (see Schindler s.v., though I do not follow his interpr. of this passage), as an adverb. It forms a phrasal verb with √i ‘go hastily’ (so approx. Old). In context túraṃ ya(tī́ṣu) is a close match to the immed. following turáyan. It would be an even better match if the 2nd participle were turaṇyán (two forms of this verbal stem are found in the Dadhikrā hymn IV.40: turaṇyatáḥ 3a, turaṇyati 4a, and cf. also turaṇyasát 2b), and I am tempted to think that the poet had this stem in mind, but opted for phonologically similar turáyant- because his preferred form would have produced a bad break. Like turaṇyasát in 40.2, our form would be a deliberate deformation of the expected one to fit metrical circumstances, though our turáyan makes no morphological difficulties, unlike turaṇyasát.
