Dawn After the almost impenetrable last two hymns, the Dawn series comes as a welcome relief, though it does not lack puzzles or Kakṣīvant’s characteristic flourishes. Note also the prevalence of āmreḍitas and similar expressions (gr̥háṃgrham ̥ , divé-dive, śáśvat, and ágram-agram all in vs. 4; then ékaikā in 8 at long remove, bhadrám-bhadram in 13).
