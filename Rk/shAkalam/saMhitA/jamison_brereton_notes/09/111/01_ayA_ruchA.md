To achieve 8 syllables in pāda c we need to read sū́raḥ as trisyllabic, as Old points out - a fairly rare scansion for this word.

On “all forms” see comm. ad IX.64.8.

Ge (n. 1fg) suggests that the “versifiers with their seven mouths” refers to the Aṅgirases, since the same word saptā́sya- is used of Bṛhaspati with ref. to the Aṅgireses in IV.50.4 and with direct ref. to Aṅgira in IV.51.4. This is quite plausible, given that the next vs. conerns the Vala myth - but the phrase must simultaneously apply to the current ritualists.
