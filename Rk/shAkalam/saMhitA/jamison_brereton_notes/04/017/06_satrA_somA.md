In pāda a the word víśve was omitted in the publ. tr., which should be emended to “Entirely his were all the soma-drinks.” The three initial satrā́(a, b, c) are echoed by dátre beginning d. Although there is some dissension on the root etym. of dátra- (cf., e.g., Old, who cites Neisser derivation from dáyate ‘apportion’ -- an analysis apparently followed by both Ge and WG, judging from their tr. ‘Anteil’), the correct analysis was already sketched by Gr s.v.: it is a -tra- deriv. built to the weak stem of the redupl. pres. to √dā ‘give’ (dad-), hence *dáttra, with simplification of the geminate before r, as often. See AiG II.2.703 and the important (if lapidary) correction in the Nachtr. to AiG I: Nachtr. p.

3, to I.5 ll. 30-31.
