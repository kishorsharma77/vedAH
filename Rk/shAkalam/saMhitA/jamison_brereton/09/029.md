Soma Pavamāna
Nr̥medha  Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Another short and conventional hymn, with a focus on winning goods and con quering enemies (esp. vss. 3–5). It is attributed to the same poet as IX.27.
## 1
His streams have flowed forth, those of the pressed bull, who with his  strength
attends upon the gods in sequence. 2. The ritual adepts groom the team—the bards singing with their song the one born as the light worthy of hymns.
## 3
These things are easy to conquer for you as you become purified, o Soma  providing outstanding goods.
Increase the sea that is worthy of hymns.
## 4
Winning all good things, purify yourself in a stream, Soma.
Drive hostilities to a single end.
## 5
Protect us well from the non-giver, from the mere sound of any such a one, when we have become free of insult.
## 6
O drop, in purifying yourself in a stream attract earthly and heavenly  wealth.
Bring here your brilliant tempestuous force.
