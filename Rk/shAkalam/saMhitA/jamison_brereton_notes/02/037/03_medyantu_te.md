Although the default referent of the voc. vanaspate in a ritual context might be assumed to be the sacrificial post (cf. III.8.1, 3, 6, 11), the contents of ab -- both the draught animals of a and vīḍayasvā in b -- point rather to the chariot. See VI.47.26 cited by both Ge and Re. Why the chariot is addressed and identified with the wealth-giver is not clear to me, save for the fact that in the later ritual the Ṛtugraha libations take place in the cart shed (see, e.g., Eggeling, SBE 26.319-20).

Note that the havirdhāna carts are the subject of the last tṛca of nearby II.41 (vss. 19- 21).
