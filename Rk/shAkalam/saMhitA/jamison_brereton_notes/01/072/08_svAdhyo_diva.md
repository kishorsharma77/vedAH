The first pāda lacks an overt verb, but it is easy to read ví … ajānan from b (with most tr.), rather than supplying an entirely different verb as Ge does (“brachten”). The identity of the subject is likewise not given, but, with Ge, it is quite likely the Aṅgirases. The qualifier svādhī́- ‘very attentive’ is a signature word of Parāśara’s (I.67.2, 70.4, 71.8); the occurrence in 71.8 is applied to the troop, presumably the Aṅgirases, that Agni begets in punishing Heaven’s incest.

The “seven youthful ones of heaven” are the heavenly rivers; note the corresponding phrase in the previous hymn, I.71.7 (though in a simile) sravátaḥ saptá yahvī́ḥ “the seven youthful streams,” and for divó yahvī́- III.1.6, 9, VII.70.3.

The position of ā́between diváḥ and saptá yahvī́ḥ does give one pause, however, since postposed ā́with abl. can mean ‘from’. Perhaps this is a mixed construction: “from heaven they discerned the … maidens of heaven.” I do not know what the seven maidens of heaven are doing here.

The VP “discerned the doors of wealth” (rāyó dúro ví … ajānan) is a variant of “opened the doors (of wealth)” found twice earlier in the Parāśara collection:
