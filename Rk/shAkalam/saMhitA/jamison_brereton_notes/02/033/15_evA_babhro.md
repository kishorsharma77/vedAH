In the publ. tr., the yáthā cl. is rendered as a purpose cl. (“… that you do not become angry …”), but yáthā purpose cls. always take the subjunctive, as Macd.

already pointed out. It should rather be construed with the vs.-initial evā́, in the usual “just as …, so …” relationship, though with the usual order reversed. Macd. also recognized this, but suggested that evā́is “to be taken with c, since in the normal syntactical order if should follow yáthā in the sense which it has here.” This is a trickier piece of syntax than I think can be justified — hopscotching the evā́over the whole yáthā clause — and the contents of c do not conform to the standard usage of summary evā́. Instead I think evā́sums up the successful achievement of the wishes expressed in the preceding vs. (and perhaps in the whole preceding hymn): “even as you are not angry and do not smite, so (it is): the missile has avoided us, the bows are unstrung, etc.” This is somewhat hard to render in Engl., but I would change the publ. tr. to “Just as you are not angry and do not smite, so (it has come to pass).”
