Agni
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: triṣṭubh
This brief hymn describes Agni’s appearance “in his own home” (vs. 1b) and “in the  household” (vs. 2b), but although he is a domestic fire, Agni also extends to heaven  and earth and the four directions (vs. 1cd). Agni’s principal function here is to pro tect the household against unnamed difficulties (vss. 2a, 2c) and accusations (vs. 2c).  It is because he protects the family that he is Varuṇa and Mitra (vs. 3a), since these  two gods guard the structure of the household and of the larger society.
