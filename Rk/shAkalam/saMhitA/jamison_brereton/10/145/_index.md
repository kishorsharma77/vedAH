Against Cowives  
Indrāṇī  
6 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 6  
Attributed to Indra’s wife, Indrāṇī, this hymn is spoken in the 1st person by a  woman conjuring against her cowife for the affections of their joint husband. In  Atharvan style (and with an Atharvaveda correspondent, AVŚ III.18), it combines  ritual/magic action with a verbal spell. The speaker digs the efficacious plant (vss. 1–2) and applies the plant to her husband (vs. 6), while confidently proclaiming  her victory over her rival (esp. vss. 3–5). A similar hymn against cowives is found  at X.159.
