The first hemistich is either a syntactic fragment -- a long NP in the nominative establishing the topic -- or pátyamānaḥ is a predicated pres. part. (The publ. tr. takes it as the former.) In c ca appears to be subordinating, given the accent on the verb áśreḥ. I would now be inclined to delete the “and” in the publ. tr. and remove the parens.

from “when.”
