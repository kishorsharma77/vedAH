As just indicated, this vs. belongs to the class of “meta” final vss., commenting on the hymn just completed. I would now be inclined to tr. the root pres.

injunc. staut as “has just praised.” The second pāda is interesting for the interaction between analytic phrases and compounds. That is, the first member of the bahuvrīhi rāyás-kāma- ‘having desire for wealth’, rāyáḥ, itself a gen. case form rather than stem form in composition, is modified by / compared to an independent gen. viśvápsnyasya. The connection of this adj. with ‘wealth’ is clear from VIII.97.15, where the independent gen. rāyáḥ is modified by viśvápsnyasya: kadā́… rāyá ā́daśasyer, viśvápsnyasya ...

On the sense of the adj., see comm. ad VIII.97.15.
