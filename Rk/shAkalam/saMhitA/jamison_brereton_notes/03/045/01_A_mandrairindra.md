Although I use the Engl. word ‘gladdening’ here as in the last hymn, the repetition is misleading. The Skt. word here tr. is mandrá-, whereas in the last hymn it was haryatá-.

The simile concerning the bird and the snare is reminiscent of the much more obscure image in I.125.2, in which an animal of some kind seems to be bound up and captured.
