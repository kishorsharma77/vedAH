This one was born here on the foundation of Manu as the best sacrificing  Hotar, following the commandment of the fire-priests—Agni,  
following his own commandment—  
all attentive to the one who seeks a comrade, like wealth for the one who  seeks fame.  
The undeceivable Hotar has sat down in the footprint of refreshment— enveloped in the footprint of refreshment.
