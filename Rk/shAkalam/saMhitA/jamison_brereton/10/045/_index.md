Agni  
Vatsaprī Bhālandana  
12 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn begins with Agni’s triple birth, in heaven, on the earthly sacrificial  ground, and in the waters (vs. 1), and the next verses touch on Agni’s several  forms (vss. 2–3). The cosmic aspects of Agni (vss. 4–6, 8) are thus marshaled in  service of the ritual Agni, installed as fire-priest in verse 7, and it is therefore easy  to believe in the good things that will come to the mortal who sacrifices to Agni  (vss. 9–12).
