I take ab as dependent on the previous verse, 2d, describing Indra’s cosmogonic deeds right after birth. For a novel, but not ultimately persuasive interpretation of this hemistich, see Old. Note that forms of √nī open and clause this half-verse: #táva praṇītī … ninétha#.

The position of yád in this dependent clause is somewhat disturbing. It occurs in Wackernagel’s position in the second pāda (b), but the a-pāda is part of this same clause and is intimately interwoven with the elements in pāda b: note esp. the acc. pl.

jóhuvānān, which modifies nṝ́n, the third word in b. Although superficially late position of subordinating elements is not uncommon in the RV (see, e.g., hí in pāda c), what precedes is generally syntactically unified, belonging to a single constituent (as in pāda c), but this is not true of the assorted material found in pāda a. I have no explanation.

For the oppositional pun in sám … ninétha, standing for ví (… ninétha), see the publ. intro. As I explained there, since sám and ví are preverbs of opposite 32 meaning that frequently pattern together, the sám here evokes the ví of the lexeme ví √hvā earlier in the hymn (with √hvā present here in the intensive part. jóhuvānān) and the various expressions of Indra’s pushing apart the two world-halves. E.g., nearby VII.23.3c ví bādhiṣṭa syá ródasī mahitvā́(I.51.10, VI.29.5, etc.). These associations would prompt the audience to take “bring together” as standing for “push apart,” in the standard mythology of Indra.

After the 2nd ps. description of Indra’s mythological activity in 2d-3ab, the second half of vs. 3 summarizes the birth in the 3rd person. Ge’s interpretation, which makes c parenthetical and connects ab with d despite an awkward change of person, seems clumsy.
