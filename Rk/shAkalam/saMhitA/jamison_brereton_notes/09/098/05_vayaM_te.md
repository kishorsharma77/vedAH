On váso vásvaḥ and its relation to vs. 4, see comm. there.

This vs. is supposed to contain the lexeme ní √as (#ní …, syā́ma). Gr glosses this lexeme ‘Theil haben an [G.]’, and Ge and Re both so tr. But ní is found nowhere else with √as (in the RV or in the rest of Skt, as far as I can see), and neither the additive semantics of ní + √as nor any plausible extension of it would produce ‘have a share in’, at least to my mind. RIVELEX (I. 634, 641 n. 71) agrees with me and instead glosses it ‘jmd ist im Dienst von etw.’ (628), which would yield the not very likely “may we be in service of your goods … of your refreshment and favor.” I therefore think it likely that ní is not a part of a verbal lexeme as a preverb in tmesis.

I suggest, quite tentatively, instead that it is a sort of pseudo-reduplication with the doubly marked splv. nédiṣṭhatama- ‘most nearest’, which it immediately precedes (#ní nédiṣṭhatamāḥ) or that it provides a further directional specification to that splv.: “down nearest.” I construe the various genitives with this splv. - though I recognize that this does not seem to be a standard usage. They are unlikely to go with syā́ma even in the absence of ní, because, as Re points out in his n. (though he tr. flg. Gr and Ge), √as + GEN generally means “être le lot de (qq’un),” which should produce “may we belong to your goods …” On adhrigo see comm. ad I.61.1, VIII.22.11.
