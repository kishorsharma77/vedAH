After the general proclamation of Agni’s universal powers in vs. 1, the hymn turns to the myth of the disappearance and recovery of Agni.

The immortals’ inability to find Agni “among us” (asmé) is contrasted with the success of the mortal who finds him “on the highest track,” presumably in the realm of the immortals, in vs. 4.

The acc. phrase vatsám pári ṣántam is ambiguous, since the participle can either modify vatsám (“the calf enclosing …”) or take vatsám as object (“enclosing the calf”). Ge (WG) interpret it as the latter, Old, Re the former. Ge is surely correct: pári ṣántam elsewhere (IV.1.15, VI.17.5, adduced by Ge) qualifies the rock that is the Vala cave and takes “cows” as its object; cf. VI.17.5c … ádrim pári gā́ḥ … sántam “… the rock enclosing the cows.” Although in the usual myth of the disappearance of Agni, he is hidden not in a rock but in the waters, this transference of Vala phraseology is enabled here because Agni is called a calf, and cattle were enclosed in the Vala cave.

There is a slight phonological play in the phrase amṛ́tā ámūrāḥ. Also note víśve amṛ́tāḥ “all the immortals,” a variant of víśve devā́ḥ. The use of this phrase is telling because in Parāśara’s Vaiśvānara series (I.68-70) víśve is reserved to evoke “all (men).” See discussion esp. in I.68 and in Jamison Klein Fs. 2016. I.68.8 also contains a pāda-final ámūrāḥ, there referring to men.

Although the perfect of √sthā without preverb is almost always presential (see Kü p. 580), in this mythological narrative it must be preterital (or at least so tr.

into English), like the injunctive vindan in pāda a; perhaps we can think of it as a sort of “honorary” injunctive, whose temporal value is determined by context.

The form cā́ru (so Pp.; Saṃhitā cā́rv) is taken as a locative by Sāy (cāru cāruṇi śobhane). This unlikely analysis is followed explicitly by Ge and Old (SBE, more doubtfully Noten) and implicitly by Re and WG. (Gr. takes it as an adverb.) I take it rather as the neut. acc. it appears to be and an alternative locational expression to the adjacent loc. padé paramé, supplying nā́ma ‘name’ on the basis of nā́māni in the next verse (3c) and the frequency of the collocation cā́ru nā́ma. It’s worth noting that cā́ru nā́ma can be hidden or secret (e.g., II.35.11, IX.96.16), and so it would be appropriate to this tale of the hidden Agni. What exactly it would mean to take their stand at his name is not clear, perhaps at the place where Agni’s name is invoked in ritual performance. This would fit with the following verse. It’s also possible that if Agni’s dear name is what’s at issue, then the padé paramé might be the highest word, as well as or instead of the highest track. (See 6ab below.)
