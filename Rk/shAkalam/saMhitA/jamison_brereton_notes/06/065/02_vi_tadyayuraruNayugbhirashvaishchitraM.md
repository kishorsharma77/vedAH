For a more complex comparison of the Maruts to fire(s), see vs. 10.

In c, where the gen. pl. eṣām seems to preclude the Maruts as referent of the nom. pl. areṇávo hiraṇyáyāsaḥ, Sāy. supplies ráthāḥ, and this might be possible or at least harmless, although the positive evidence for it is slim. The 2nd adj. hiraṇyáyais used not infrequently of chariots or their parts (wheels, wheel-rims), but also of a wide range of other things, including gods and those include the Maruts (V.87.5); ‘dustless’ has a more limited range of application. In nearby VI.62.6 it qualifies yójanebhiḥ, rendered there as ‘treks’ and, as I argue ad loc., a near synonym for ‘paths’, which are twice described as ‘dustless’ (I.35.11, 163.6). This is as close as we’ll get to chariots: in its 8 occurrences it is never used of chariots or parts thereof.

It is, however, used of the Maruts in I.168.4. Because chariots are intrusive in our passage and interrupt the otherwise constant reference to the Maruts in the nom. pl.

(ab and, in my opinion, d) and because the combination of adjectives doesn’t point to chariots -- or any referent but the Maruts, who are described by both adjectives elsewhere -- I now think the nom. plurals in c refer to the Maruts. What then to do with eṣām? I propose construing it with the instrumentals in d. The pāda boundary intervenes, but this is hardly fatal. I would now emend the tr. to “dustless and golden, they came into being all at once with their (eṣām) manly and male powers.” However, pace Ge and Re, even if we were to keep ‘chariots’ as the referent in c, I do not think these same chariots could be the subj. of d. Rather, by that interpr., c is parenthetic and the Maruts return as subj. in d, which again treats the topic of their simultaneous birth. Ge’s parallels (see n. 2cd) contravene his tr. (“ihre staublosen goldigen (Wagen) sind zugleich mit ihren Manneskräften und Stärken entstanden”) because the parallel passages with sākám √jan (etc.) all concern the birth of the Maruts—certainly not their chariots! Pāda-init. sākám plays off identically position sakṛ́t in 1d.
