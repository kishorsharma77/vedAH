The iva in the simile is also displaced to the right, as in the previous vs. The simile is also more complex than it first appears. The obvious way to render it is “In whom are fixed all poetic arts like the nave in a wheel,” with Varuṇa the wheel and the poetic arts the nave, but the more likely image is that the spokes are fit into the nave -- with Varuṇa the nave and the unexpressed spokes the poetic arts.

I have no idea what or who tritá- stands for.

The images in de are also somewhat skewed. Ge takes the two pādas separately, with d a nominal sentence with infinitival saṃyúje as predicate, despite the yoking vocabulary common to both pādas. He must do that because the gā́vaḥ in d must be nom., but corresponds logically to the acc. áśvān in e. Old suggests taking gā́vaḥ as acc. (as also possibly in IX.24.2, on which see comm. ad loc.). I take the two pādas together, classifying it as another example of case disharmony in a simile (Jamison 1982), enabled by the syntactic multifunctionality of the infinitival saṃyúje, yujé (with both act. and pass. readings). Scar’s attempt (431) to construe the two pādas together and also account for the cases shows the pitfalls, as it wanders off into fanciful territory.
