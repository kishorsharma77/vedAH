As was just mentioned, verse-initial apó causes some problem. This form matches the two occurrences of apó opening 6b and 7a and grammatically should be, with them, the acc. pl. of áp- ‘water(s)’. But the problem is that ‘waters’ do not figure in the Vala myth: it is cows/dawns that are freed from the rock. For this reason Old suggests reading *ápo = ápa + u, with ápa a preverb with dárdar, and this conjecture is followed by Ge. However, ápa is only marginally attested with √dṛ (only RV VI.17.5 and nowhere else in Skt., at least acdg. to MWms). I therefore accept the transmitted apó and assume 1) syntactically, that √dṛ takes a double obj.

here (“tear open the rock ACC (for) the waters ACC”), and 2) thematically, that because of the interpenetration of the Vala and Vṛtra myths just mentioned the cows/dawns in the Vala myth get assimilated to the waters of the Vṛtra myth. My ‘tore open’ actually assumes that Old’s ápa-u is secondarily present, with my ‘open’ representing *ápa. It is worth noting that forms of the root √dṛ are fairly rare without preverb. Schmidt (B+I 162), Hoffmann (Injunk. 270), and WG also all accept the ‘waters’ reading. Note that the waters here would correspond to the acc. with √dṛ in pāda c: vā́jam ‘prize’. That is, the prize in c is what gets torn out of the rock (waters), while the rock in pāda a is what gets torn apart to get to the prize.

Acdg. to Schaeffer (136), the intens. to √dṛ has become lexicalized and no longer has any discernible frequentative value. However, most forms of this intens.

take plural objects, so it could be object-distributive. In our case the pl. apáḥ ‘waters’ might fit this model, though the pl. tantum ‘waters’ really functions as a mass noun, not a set of countable hunks of water. See also ví dardaḥ in 13d below.

I take adverbial neut. pūrvyám in b as meaning ‘previously, before’, and in conjunction with the injunc. āvír bhuvat, as a somewhat awkward attempt to express anteriority: Saramā appeared to you previously (b), ordering you to √dṛ (ā́darṣi, c), and then you did so (dárdar, a). Schmidt (B+I 162) avoids the anteriority reading by tr. ‘zuerst’, and Hoffmann (Injunk. 270) and WG render it “als erstes,” an interpr.

that would seem to me to require an adj. modifying nom. sg. fem. sarámā, not an adverbial neut.

Ge takes the 2nd hemistich as the words of Saramā, an interpr. I accept both because of the si-impv. ā́darṣi in c and because of the pseudo-anterior construction in b just discussed.

Verse-final gṛṇānáḥ has an exact match at the end of vs. 1, and this bit of ring composition signals that this section of the hymn is finished. In the next section we move on to the Kutsa / Uśanā Kāvya story.
