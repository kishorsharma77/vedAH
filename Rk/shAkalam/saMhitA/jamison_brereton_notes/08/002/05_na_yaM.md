tṛprá- only here in the RV, though it appears later and may also be related to tṛpála- (RV 2x), also used of soma (see EWA s.v.); ‘sharp’ is only a guess, though shared with Ge, a characterization of soma usually expressed by tīvrá- (as in 10b).

In c ápa √spṛ is found only here in the RV; if it belongs to √spṛ ‘win’, it might mean ‘win away’. Ge. tr. “abstossen” (repel). EWA (s.v. SPAR) suggests that it belongs to a synchronically separate root ‘losmachen, befreien, in Sicherheit bringen’, in which case ‘keep away’ would work.
