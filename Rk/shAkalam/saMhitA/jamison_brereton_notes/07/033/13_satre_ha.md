This vs. is the basis of Old’s (and others’) reconstruction of the 1st birth of Vasiṣṭha (see comm. add vss. 10-13), with Mitra and Varuṇa at a Sattra emitting semen into a pot, which then gave rise to both Agastya and Vasiṣṭha. Unfortunately the details of this vs. are far from clear, though pāda b does (fairly) straightforwardly depict a dual entity pouring semen into a pot.

The gravest problems are in pāda a. The opening satré ha is interpr. by Sāy, fld. by Ge., as standing for sattré ‘at a Sattra’. The single -t- versus double -tt- before

-r- is of course not a problem [Max Müller’s ed. in fact prints sattré], but it is the
case that, though the word sat(t)rá- and its ritual complex are well attested already in Saṃhitā prose, the word is not found elsewhere in the RV. (However, the ritual almost surely already existed; there seems a clear reference to it in vs. 9 of the Indra hymn III.31, where the Aṅgirases “sit a sitting” [sádanam √sad, though with the words not in the same VP] to open the Vala cave. See comm. ad loc.) However, Gr suggests reading *satréhá instead, to be analyzed as the adv. satrā́‘entirely’ and ihá ‘here’; the only change required would be accenting the second word. Old sits on the fence, but seems weakly to favor the Sattra interpr., as do I, since it at least provides richer semantics and a ritual context for the actions. Moreover the particle ha would exactly match the same particle in the same location in pāda c.

The next problem is jātaú. If it is a dual ppl. (rather than a loc. sg. to the putative stem jātí-, which, however, is not found in the RV), it can of course modify the dual subjects of the verb siṣicathuḥ, and it is also quite possible that that dual subject is Mitra and Varuṇa, as Old and Ge interpr. it. The problem is thus not syntactic but semantic. In what way would M+V be “born” at a Sattra? Ge elides the problem by (as far as I can see) folding it into an anodyne phrase with iṣitā́, rendered as “erregt geworden,” where I assume the ‘geworden’ is a bleached, auxiliary-like version of jātaú. Sāy glosses it as dīkṣitau, and this might nicely reflect the middle Vedic configuration of the dīkṣā of a soma sacrificer as tantamount to a second birth.

No forms of the (secondary) root √dīkṣ are found in the RV; however, both dīkṣā́- and dīkṣitá- are attested in the AV, with the former fairly common. I therefore am inclined to follow Sāy’s interpr. -- or what I assume Sāy’s interpr. rests on -- that jātaú refers to the conceptual rebirth of a consecrated sacrificer. This rebirth would be somewhat comparable to the two births of Vasiṣṭha himself. This interpr. of jātaú would be more clearly expressed than in the publ. tr. by rendering it “(re)born [=consecrated] at a (ritual) Session.” Pāda c appears to describe the creation of Agastya (see comm. above ad vss.

10-13). Māna is the name of Agastya’s father and family or indeed of Agastya himself. See Mayrhofer PN s.v. for reff.

Kü (99, 570) has a very diff. interpr. of the vs. In the first hemistich he takes kumbhé as a dual, modified by the dual ppl. in pāda a and subject of the dual verb in b: “Beim Somaopfer geboren, angetrieben durch Verehrungen haben die beiden Krüge den gemeinsamen Samen ergossen” (99). This is grammatically impossible, 42 because kumbhá- is masc., as the two occurrences of the acc. pl. kumbhā́n show, and so its dual should be *kumbhā́(u). In c he takes mā́naḥ as ‘house’: “Mitten daraus ist ein Haus hervorgegangen” (99=570). He does not comment on the mythological content of the vs., but though mā́na- ‘building, house’ is at least marginally attested in the RV (clearest in VII.88.5), the creation of a house from semen would be such an outlandish feat that the creation of a seer seems positively plausible.

In b the pf. siṣicatuḥ has a retroflexed root init., as we would expect. But the other two forms of the pf. in the RV (sisicuḥ II.24.4 and sisice III.32.15) do not. I have no explanation for the discrepancy.
