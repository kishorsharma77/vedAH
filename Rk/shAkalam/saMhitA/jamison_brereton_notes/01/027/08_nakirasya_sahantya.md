Since this verse continues the thought of 7, the agent noun paryetā́in b should likewise be future in value, despite Ge’s “Keiner überholt ihn.” asya … káyasya cit: most tr. take these two genitives as coreferential, with the indefinite referring to a person - so Ge’s “Keiner überholt ihn, wer er auch sei.” But the person in question has already been defined as a client of Agni’s, and so an indefinite seems odd in context. Moreover, the other two instances of paryetár- both take inanimate complements; cf. VII.40.3 ná tásya rāyáḥ paryetā́sti "There exists no one who can encompass his wealth." Therefore I take káyasya cit as referring to anything belonging to the favored man, expressed by asya. Ge’s note seems to lean in this direction, but not his tr.

On śravā́yya- see I.31.5 below.
