The first three pādas almost, but not quite, provide a tripartite ritual speech division: Sāmaveda, Ṛgveda, X? Veda. The last is the problem: the “formulators” don’t work very well as speakers of Yajurveda yajuses, and it’s too early for the brāhmaṇa priest to be associated with the Atharvaveda, as in later Vedic.

Pace most translators, pf. yemire is ordinarily presential in value; see Kümmel s.v. yam.
