The agent noun séktar-, which forms an etymological figure with sisice, presumably refers to a habitual or practiced ‘pourer’. So Tichy (-tar-stems, 159, fld.

by Kü 570). I have taken kóśam as the obj. in the simile rather than the frame, contra the standard tr., though it could certainly go in the frame or in both without appreciably affecting the sense.

The pf. form lacks retroflexion on its root initial, as does one of the other two forms of this pf. in the RV (sisicuḥ II.24.4), as opposed to expected siṣicatuḥ in VIII.33.13. I have no explanation for the lack of retroflexion.
