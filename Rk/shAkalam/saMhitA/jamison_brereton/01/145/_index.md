Agni  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
5 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5  
The hymn begins with the peremptory (2nd pl.) command “Ask him!” In the first  two verses Agni is depicted as the possessor of secret knowledge that we mortals beg  him to impart to us and, in verses 2–3, as the god who is always attentive to the sac rifice whose success he ensures. A sample of his secret knowledge seems to be given  in verse 4, a riddling and, at least for these translators, unsolved depiction of ritual  activity. The final verse forms a ring with verse 1. It begins with a continuation of  the riddling language of verse 4: the “wild beast of the waters” may be a reference to  

Agni’s identification with Apām Napāt (“Child of the Waters”), whose roaming in  the woods refers to his burning of firewood. Once installed as the ritual fire in pāda  b, Agni implicitly answers the questions asked of him in verses 1–2 in pāda c: he  explains the ritual patterns to us. In the final pāda he is characterized by the same  vocabulary as in verse 1:  “knowing” (vidvā́n) matching “he knows (veda) of 1a;  “perceiver of truth” ([r̥ta-]cít) matching “the one who perceives” (cikitvā́n) of 1b.
