This difficult vs. has been subject to numerous interpretations. Mine is guided by Thieme’s (Gs Nyberg = Kl Schr (II) 829-30), who sees this as a description of the V-shaped formation of geese in flight (of which Google Images supplies many pictures, including bar-headed geese flying to/from their wintering grounds in India). The “nose” is the lead goose and therefore a particularly crucial figure, the śū́ra- ‘champion, hero’ of the cmpd. śū́ranas- ‘having a hero as a nose’ (an analysis that goes back to Bloomfield, RR 150; Bl’s other analyses there are less compelling). sílika-madhayama- has a hapax as first member; if Th’s interpr.

(‘hollow space’) and etymological connection (with sirā́- ‘vein’) are accepted, the cmpd. means ‘having a hollow space in the middle’, which accurately describes the V-formation. The other problematic bahuvrīhi is īrmā́nta-. Th. takes īrmá- as ‘foreleg, thigh’, not īrmá- ‘quiet, at rest’. The ‘foreleg’ sense is found in the AV (X.10.21), and Aves. ar(ə)ma- ‘arm’ appears to be cognate (so EWA s.v.). The sense of the cmpd, ‘having (fore)legs as its edges’, must reflect the fact that, looked at straight on, the V-formation (roughly an isoceles triangle) can look like a stick-figure human from the waist down, with the legs being the two equal sides, meeting at the tip, which is equivalent to the waist.

The verb in d, ā́kṣisuḥ, is generally taken as an isolated -siṣ-aor. to √naś ‘attain’ (so Gr, Narten 160; Wh Roots puts it under √akṣ as -iṣ-aor., but takes √akṣ as a secondary root form from √aś). This is certainly possible, but I prefer to analyze it as an isolated (and nonce) -siṣ-aor. to √aj ‘drive’, which would then take a cognate acc. ájmam, hence ‘have driven their drive’.
