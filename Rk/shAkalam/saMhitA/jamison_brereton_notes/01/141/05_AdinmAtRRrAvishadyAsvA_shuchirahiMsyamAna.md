The mothers (mātṝ́ḥ) of pāda a contrast with the father (pitúḥ) of 4a.

The standard tr. take ví vāvṛdhe in b as the verb of a rel. cl. begun by yā́su in a.

The problem is that vāvṛdhe is not accented. Ge suggests that it lacks accent because the rel. pronoun is in a different pāda, but this separation does not pose problems elsewhere (cf., simply within this hymn, 3ab nír yád …, … kránta, 3cd yád …, … mathāyáti, 6cd … yád …, … véti); Old is in favor of emending to vivāvṛdhé. Taking the text as given, I construe the rel. clause with yā́su as a nominal locational clause; similarly (but independently) WG with a different distribution of elements. It is true that there are several yā́su √vrdh̥ passages; cf. esp. II.13.1 … apáḥ … ā́viśad yā́su várdhate “he [=Indra] entered the waters, within whom he grows strong” (cf. V.44.1), but I think we must take the lack of verbal accent more seriously than these few phraseological parallels.

Again, contrary to most, I attach c to ab and take d separately, on the basis of the distribution of verb tenses.
