Ge (/WG) take pāda a as a separate clause and consider pā́tram ‘cup, vessel’ a metaphorical designation of Indra (“Ist er wohl das rechte Gefäss für solch gottergebene Männer?”). With Old I consider this to be an anachronistic application of the much later sense of ‘cup, bowl’ to mean ‘appropriate recipient’. (It is true that Indra is referred to as a ‘tankard’ [I.61.9] and a ‘beaker’ [I.100.12] elsewhere, but in those cases it is his capacious size that is at issue.) Old and Re both avoid the Indra = cup interpretation by supplying a verb (different verbs in each case). I see no reason to supply a verb, since pā́tram can be an acc. goal with turaṇyán (see X.61.11 for another acc. of goal with the same stem), a possibility also allowed by Old.
