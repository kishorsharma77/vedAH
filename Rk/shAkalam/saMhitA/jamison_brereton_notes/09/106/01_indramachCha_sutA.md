As Re points out, the exact nuance of śruṣṭī́is hard to pinpoint, but Ge’s recessive adverb “willig” does not seem sufficient. Re also adduces II.3.9 śruṣṭī́… jāyate, similar to our śruṣṭī́jātā́saḥ. I interpr. both passages to mean that the right ritual birth happens because of a/the god’s attention to the process (Tvaṣṭar in II.3.9, Indra here).
