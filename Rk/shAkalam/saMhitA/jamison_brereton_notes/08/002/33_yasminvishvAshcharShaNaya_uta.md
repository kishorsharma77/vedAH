Ge takes Indra as the referent of c with maghónaḥ acc. pl. referring to human benefactors (“Wenn er berauscht ist, so tut er es den freigebigen Herren gleich”). However, mandín- usually describes soma (although it does modify Indra in I.9.2, 101.1, and X.96.6), and the only occurrence of mándiṣṭha- in the RV is found in this hymn and also modifies soma: VIII.2.9 mándiṣṭhaḥ śū́rasya "most invigorating for the champion," with a dependent genitive, which is how I take maghónaḥ here. I therefore, somewhat reluctantly take the subject to be soma, who is accompanying (ánu) Indra, who already contains the multitudes listed in pāda a.

However, the appearance of pl. maghónām in the next verse (34c), where it refers to humans who receive Indra’s largesse, gives me pause, and it is quite possible that Ge’s interpretation is correct.
