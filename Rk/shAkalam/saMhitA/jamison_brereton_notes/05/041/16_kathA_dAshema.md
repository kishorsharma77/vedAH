As does upamātivániḥ in 16e. On this form and on the meter of both -vániḥ forms, see Scar 467. On úpamāti- see comm. ad VIII.40.9.

The opening of the vs., kathā́dāśema, echoes 11a kathā́… bravāma. In both cases the object of our action is the Maruts. Another echo is found in evayā́(ḥ), which is a scrambling of yé va évā(ḥ) of 5d and 13a (though yé and -yā(ḥ) are completely different grammatically), in both cases of the Maruts. The sequence in our pāda b, evayā́marútaḥ “the Maruts traveling their ways,” is also matched by the punctuating exclamation evayā́marut found in every vs. of the Anhangslied to the Maruts that ends this maṇḍala (V.87.1-9, tr. there “Maruts on the march”).
