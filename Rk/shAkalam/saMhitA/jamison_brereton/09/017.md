Soma Pavamāna
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
8 verses: gāyatrī
A straightforward hymn: the soma juices flow quickly on their journey through the  filter into the vessels and thence to Indra and the gods, a journey compared to that  of the sun. The role of speech in the soma sacrifice is also emphasized, with soma  both inspiring speech and being strengthened by it.
## 1
Like rivers along a downward slope, smashing obstacles, turbulent, the swift soma juices have been sent surging.
## 2
As they are pressed, the drops, the soma juices, like rains to the earth, have flowed to Indra.

## 3
The exhilarating drink of exhilaration, the soma, rushes into the filter  beyond the waves,
smashing aside the demons, seeking the gods.
## 4
He runs into the tubs; he is poured around into the filter.
He grows strong through the hymns at the sacrifices.
## 5
You blaze beyond the three luminous realms like the (sun) ascending to  heaven, o Soma.
Sending forth (speech), you have spurred it on, like the sun.
## 6
The inspired poets, the bards, have roared to him at the head of the  sacrifice,
keeping the dear one in their sight.
## 7
The men, the inspired poets, seeking help, groom you, the prizewinning  horse,
with their insights, for the divine conclave.
## 8
Flow following the stream of honey. You, the sharp (soma), have taken  your seat,
pleasing to be drunk for truth.
