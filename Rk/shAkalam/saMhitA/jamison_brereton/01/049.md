Dawn
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
4 verses: anuṣṭubh
A short and simple hymn, treating Dawn’s journey from heaven to the earthly  realm (vss. 1–2), to rouse the living world (vs. 3). The poets’ response to her

coming and their hope that her advent will bring them gifts end the hymn  (vs. 4cd).
## 1
Dawn, with your auspicious (rays) come here, even from the luminous  realm of heaven.
Let the (horses) whose breath is reddish convey you right to the house of  the one who has soma.
## 2
The well-ornamented, well-naved chariot that you have
mounted, Dawn—
with it further the people of good fame today, Daughter of Heaven.
## 3
Even the winged birds and the two-footed and four-footed, o silvery Dawn, have set forth following your regulations of time, from the ends  of heaven—
## 4
For, dawning forth with your rays, you illuminate the whole
luminous realm.
Just you, Dawn, have the Kaṇvas, longing for goods, called upon
with songs.
