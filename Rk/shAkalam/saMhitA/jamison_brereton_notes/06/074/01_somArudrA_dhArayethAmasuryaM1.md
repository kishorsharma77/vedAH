In my view, iṣṭí- in b is meant to express both ‘desire’ and ‘sacrifice’ (from √iṣ and √yaj respectively), encapsulating the reciprocity inherent in the compact between gods and men. Ge is sympathetic to ‘sacrifice’ (n. 1b) but points to the accent: ‘sacrifice’ is ordinarily accented íṣṭi-. But secondary senses (that is, puns) often ignore accentual differences, and furthermore, as JL has persuasively argued, the older accent of -tí-abstracts was suffixal, and selective accent retraction can be observed in the course of the Vedic period, so we might assume an older *iṣṭí- ‘sacrifice’.
