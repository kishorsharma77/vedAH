The vs. begins with the two words that began the first two pādas of the last vs.: 4ab mahā́m̐…, ugráṃ; 5a mahā́m̐ugró.

Ge (/WG, Scar [209]) take samā́cakre in b as transitive and supply ‘cows’ as object, from c. Although it is true that the middle pf. of √kṛ is generally transitive, in this context, parallel to intrans. vāvṛdhe in pāda a, a nonce passive value can be imagined. In fact see (in this same maṇḍala) III.1.8 vṛ́ṣā yátra vāvr̥dhé kā́vyena “where the bull has grown strong through our poetic craft,” of which this pāda seems to be a variant, with the vāvṛdhe there anticipated in our previous pāda. Cf. Re “il s’est empli … de pourvoir-poétique,” also intransitive. (Ge suggests this possibility in his n. 5b.) Scar (209-10) makes heavier weather of vājadā́(ḥ) then seems necessary. He points out that the cows shouldn’t be giving prizes, which is logically true enough, but surely the point is that Indra is so generous that even the prizes he gives, the cows, give prizes of their own (the trickle-down gift economy). Their gifts are presumably, on the one hand, milk products and, on the other, new calves.
