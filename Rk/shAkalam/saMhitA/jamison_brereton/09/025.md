Soma Pavamāna
Drḍ̥ hacyuta Āgastya
6 verses: gāyatrī
This is the only hymn in the R̥gveda attributed to this poet, though his patronymic  connects him to Agastya, the poet of a number of hymns in the late Ist Maṇḍala  (I.165–91)—including the dialogue hymn I.165, in which Agastya mediates between  Indra and the Maruts, who demand a share of the soma sacrifice. This connection  may account for the mention of the Maruts in verse 1 as recipients of soma, along  with Vāyu: the Maruts are quite scarce in the Soma Maṇḍala.
The hymn is otherwise unremarkable, though one might note the insistent iden tification of Soma as a kaví (“poet,” vss. 3, 5, 6).
## 1
Purify yourself, as the one who brings skill to realization, for the gods to  drink, o tawny one,
the exhilarating drink for the Maruts and for Vāyu.
## 2
Self-purifying one, sped by insight, ever roaring toward your womb, enter Vāyu according to the (ritual) statute.
## 3
The bull becomes beautiful together with the gods, the dear poet in  his womb,
the smasher of obstacles, best pursuer of the gods.
## 4
Entering into all forms, becoming purified, the delightful one journeys to where the immortals have their seats.
## 5
Ruddy Soma, giving birth to songs, purifies himself, attended by the Āyus, going to Indra with a poet’s purpose.
## 6
Purify yourself in a stream in the filter, you most exhilarating poet, to sit in the womb of chant.
