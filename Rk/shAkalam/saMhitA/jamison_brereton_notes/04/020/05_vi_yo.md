In my opinion, the first half-vs. consists of two separate similes, the second of which, sṛ́ṇyo ná jétā, needs to be fleshed out. In the first one Indra with his abundant seers is like a tree with ripe fruit (vṛkṣó ná pakváḥ). In the second Indra the winner/conquerer is like a man who harvests the fruit with a sickle -- or more likely who harvests grain, the crop having subtly changed, with the pakvá- ‘ripened’ held constant. Cf. X.101.3 nédīya ít srṇ̥ yàḥ pakvám éyāt “the ripe (grain) should come even closer to our sickles.” For ripe grain see I.66.3 yávo ná pakvó jétā jánānām “Ripe like grain, a conquerer of peoples,” which also contains jétar-, though in my view in an independent syntagm.

The simile in the 2nd half-vs. is striking because it casts Indra as a maiden (yóṣām), pursued by the poet as a dashing and virile young man (márya-, a word sometimes applied to Indra) -- a notable gender reversal. This vs. contains one of the few finite forms of the secondary root √rapś ‘teem, abound’, and 2c has an occurrence of the better-attested related possessive adj.

virapśín-. In the currently favored etym. the “root” √rapś was extracted ultimately from the nominal virapśá- ‘abundance’ (the basis for virapśín-), itself constructed from a dvandva of vīrá- ‘men’ and paśú- ‘beasts’ (see EWA s.v. virapśá-). It’s important to note, however, that this etym. is soundly rejected by Kü (417-18), though I still favor it. The two forms of the thematic pres. rapśa- (IV.45.1, X.113.2) are both immediately preceded by the preverb ví, which (by most lights) has been secondarily extracted from the cmpd. Our perfect form here, rarapśé, is also construed with ví, but with yáḥ intervening, and the other pf. form (VI.18.12) lacks ví but appears with prá in distant tmesis.
