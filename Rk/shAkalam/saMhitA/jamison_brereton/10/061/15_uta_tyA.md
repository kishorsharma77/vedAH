And these two sons of Rudra, the Nāsatyas who possess the chant, are  to be greeted and offered sacrifice by me, o Indra—  
the two who give (gifts) to him who, like Manus, provides the twisted  ritual grass; the delightful pair for whom pleasing offerings are set  
out; and the two that seek sacrifice among the clans.
