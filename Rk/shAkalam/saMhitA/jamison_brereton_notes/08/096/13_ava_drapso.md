The ca in c is one of the rare examples of subordinating ca in the RV, as shown by the accent induced on the verb vavártat; see Klein DGRV I.240-41. Its position, about which Klein does not comment, is peculiar, but it can probably be accounted for metrically. In this particular Atijagatī line (13 syl.), there is a natural break after the first two words (5 syllables), máṃhiṣṭho gīrbhír, and the rest of the line behaves as if it were a dimeter (8-syl.) line, ā́ca yajñíyo vavártat, with initial preverb followed by the enclitic conjunction.
