Yet another troublesome dual verb form: avāvaśītām. It is generally agreed (Wh Rts, Ge [more or less], Re, WG, Schaeffer [179-82], Kü [486-88]) that it belongs to the root √vāś ‘bellow’. (Gr assigns it to both √vaś ‘wish’ and √vāś without comment; for reff. to further lit. on this form see Schaeffer 181-82, Kü 487- 88.) But forms to that redupl. stem are overwhelmingly middle, while this form is active. Whether it is assigned to the intensive (Schaef.) or the pluperfect (Kü), we should expect a medial 3rd du. with secondary ending. However, as was already noted with regard to avṛṇītam in the immediately preceding hymn (I.180.4), athematic 2nd and 3rd medial duals are simply not attested, and in that case the 2nd du. active form was substituted. I think the same thing happened here, and there is therefore no reason to construct specifically active semantics for this form, as do WG.

Ge (fld. by Re and WG) supplies putráḥ with c as well as d and also takes súmakha- as a PN, hence “(the son) of Sumakha.” These two decisions lead to the interpretation that one of the Aśvins is of human origin, the other divine. So, most clearly, Re: “Dissociation inattendue des Aśvins, l’un d’origine humaine, l’autre divine.” This is a major and unnecessary interpretive leap, and based on dubious though not impossible analyses of two details: there is no syntactic or rhetorical reason to supply putráḥ in c, and súmakha- is ordinarily an epithet of gods; acdg. to Mayrhofer (PN 102) this is the only possible passage in which it would be a personal name and would refer to a human, not a god. Although this vs. does, unusually, distinguish between the two Aśvins, I see no reason to ascribe human origin to one of them on the basis of this passage, which is more naturally interpreted in another fashion. It should be noted that Ge expresses some doubt about his interpr. in his n.
