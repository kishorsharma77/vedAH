With Ge I take ab as a continuation of vs. 1, with c starting a new clause.

The vocc. in ab are the self-address of the poet, as in VIII.22.1-2. Here the poet first exhorts himself with 2nd ps. imperatives (1ab) and then switches to a pseudo-modal 1st ps. -se in c. The first voc. viśvacarṣaṇe (2a) is a bit of a red herring, since this stem is otherwise used of gods. But he addresses and thus identifies himself with his speaking name Viśvamanas in b, making it clear that he was simply appropriating the divine epithet for himself.

I supply váhnīn to govern ráthānām in c, on the basis of váhniḥ in 3c and váhnī ráthānām in VIII.94.1. I surmise that this is also Re’s thinking behind “(comme conducteurs) des chars,” though he makes no comment.
