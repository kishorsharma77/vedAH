The krátu- is presumably Agni’s; cf. vs. 23 kavíkratuḥ used of him. Ge tr.

krátvā as “Mit dem Gedanken,” and takes the interior pādas bc as the directly quoted content of that thought. In addition to the aberrant tr. of krátu- (though one could tr.

“with the intention”), this seems unnecessary. Although, as Ge notes, krátvā in IV.1.1 does introduce such direct speech, it is marked there by íti, and the circumstances there are different as well.
