Ge and Re construe dákṣasya with preceding krátvā, which is certainly possible: krátu- and dákṣa- are often associated, and Ge adduces several passages containing krátvā dákṣasya (III.2.3, V.10.2 -- though in both cases JPB plausibly construed dákṣasya with something else). But since rathī́- ‘charioteer’ is regularly construed with a gen. (incl.

dákṣasya IV.10.2, VI.51.6) and since krátvā appears without gen. in nearby 4c, I take dákṣasya with rathī́-. Better might be the course suggested (but not followed) by Ge in his n.

2a: “dákṣasya wohl nach beiden Seiten zu verbinden.” This would yield the tr. “with the resolve of skill we accompany the charioteer of skill …,” which seems a bit heavy.
