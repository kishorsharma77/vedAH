The identity and distribution of forms in pāda b are oddly unclear. Is diváḥ dependent on ásurasya, or are they coreferential, or are they independent of each other? In the first instance this produces “lord of heaven” (as I have it in the publ. tr; see also W. E. Hale [Asura, p. 75] “of the asura of the Sky”); in the 2nd “Lord Heaven” (so Ge: “Asura Himmel”); in the 3rd Re’s “(les hommes) du ciel, de l’Asura.” Do these genitives qualify Rudra (gen. rudrásya in a), as I take it, or vedhásaḥ (so Ge: “die … Meister des Asura Himmel,” sim. W. E. Hale), or, with Re, are they direct qualifiers of the Maruts? I opt for the first solution because vedhásdoes not usually govern anything and because Rudra is called ásuro mahó diváḥ in II.1.6, divó ásurāya in V.41.3, and probably diváh ... ásurasya in I.122.1 contra Ge.

And in fact is vedhásaḥ nom. pl., as it’s universally taken, or another gen. sg., perhaps qualifying Rudra? Parallels cut both ways. Rudra is in fact called vedhás- in VII.46.1, but the Maruts are so called in V.52.13, 54.6.
