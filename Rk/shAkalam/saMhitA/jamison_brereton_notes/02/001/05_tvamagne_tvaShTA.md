Pāda a has the acc. and dat. appropriate to an expression of giving, but no verb; pāda c has the verb (rariṣe) but no dative of recipient. The accusatives of gift in the two pādas are formed in parallel: suvī́r i yam (a), s u váśvi yam (c).The two pādas thus complete each other rhetorically.

In b gnā́vaḥ is morphologically incoherent. By its ending it should be vocative, but since it occupies non-initial position, its accent should preclude that.

Nonetheless, with all the standard interpr. I take it as a voc. An ad hoc explanation could be concocted for its accent -- that the following voc. mitramahaḥ induced accent on the preceding one to support the voc. phrase -- but I think too many counter-examples could be adduced. Ge suggests a word haplology, gnā́<ḥ> gnāvaḥ, but this seems unnecessary and also requires a tr. “you are (the Wives).” It is likely instead that the third term in this pāda is Tvaṣṭar from pāda a, since he is regularly associated with the Wives of the Gods, and in fact the other attestation of this voc. gnā́vaḥ (I.15.3), correctly accented in pāda-initial position, refers to Tvaṣṭar.

As pointed out by Old (SBE) and Ge, the third term in pāda c is presumably Apām Napāt, who is elsewhere called āśuhéman-, including 2x in II. The āśu- in that compound echoes the beginning of āśuśukṣáṇiḥ in 1a, though that form is most probably formed to the desid. stem of √śuc with preverb ā́, since the -ani-suffix is rather commonly built to desiderative stems and there would be no obvious source of the -s- before the suffix otherwise.
