Manyu Tāpasa
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1
This hymn begins with four verses praising Manyu for his might and victory-bring ing qualities and entreating him to use these qualities against our enemies. The  following three verses (5–7) strike a more personal note, with a 1st-person speaker,  apparently deserted by Manyu for some undetermined reason. The speaker begs  Manyu to return to his side, so that together they can smite the enemy.
