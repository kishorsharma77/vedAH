As noted in the publ. intro., vss. 1-4 and 5-9 present loosely parallel treatments of the rewards of sacrifice, with 1-4 applying to the sacrificer alone and 5-9 to the sacrificer and his wife. In this vs. sunutáḥ (5b) reprises sunávat of 1b, and the structure of those two b pādas is roughly the same: sunávac ca pácāti ca and sunutá ā́ca dhā́vataḥ, with two ritual verbs conjoined by ca(s). The nítyāśirā ‘with its own proper milk-mixture’ referring to soma echoes sómam … āśíram in 2b.
