I supply ‘us’ as obj. in both a and b, adapted from 4c and esp. 5c; Ge supplies “Männer” (in b), presumably on the basis of nr̥bhiḥ in c. Either will work, but ‘us’ seems to provide more continuity.

náyasi in a connects across tṛcas with ā́nayat in 1a, and ukthaśaṃsínaḥ in b with práśastayaḥ in 3b. In 3b Indra is said to have many práśasti-, and here the producers of these (prá)śasti- are identified (as us or, with Ge, men).
