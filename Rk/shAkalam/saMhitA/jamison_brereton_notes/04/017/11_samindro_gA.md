The stem aśvi yá- with suffixal accent is ordinarily a PN; the adj. ‘equine’ is regularly áśv i ya-. However, as noted by AiG II.2.816 the accent of -ya- derivatives is variable, often within the same stem. The initial-accented áśvya- in the plural generally modifies maghā́(ni) or rā́dhāṃsi. Here I am inclined to supply maghā́ni ‘bounties’ suggested by adjacent maghávā; cf. … maghā́ni maghávā in 8d and the repeated forms of maghávan- in this portion of the hymn (7d, 8d, 9b, 13b, 13d).

The referent of pūrvī́ḥ isn’t clear. Ge (/WG) supplies ‘fortresses’, which in turn requires supplying a transitive verb: Ge “der viele (Burgen erobert hat)”; WG “der ja viele (Palisaden besiegte).” I would prefer not to supply so much material.

Moreover, in this group of hymns pūrvī́ḥ is used in temporal expressions: IV.16.19 kṣapáḥ … śarádaś ca pūrvī́ḥ “through many nights and autumns,” IV.18.4 sahásram mā́saḥ … śarádaś ca pūrvī́ḥ “for a thousand months and many autumns,” IV.19.8 pūrvī́r uṣásaḥ śarádaś ca “through many dawns and autumns.” I therefore take it that way here, as a temporal expression in a nominal rel. cl. with maghávā as the predicate.
