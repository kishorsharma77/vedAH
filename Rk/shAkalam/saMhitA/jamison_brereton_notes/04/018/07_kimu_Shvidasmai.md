This vs. celebrates the fructifying liquid that Indra released by destroying Vṛtra and depicts its effects on humans (specifically females)(ab), the landscape (c), and livestock (d). The first hemistich is a cleverly constructed echo chamber, because the females being made to swell (that is, get pregnant) there probably stand for the waters, but are also compared to waters. In other words the waters are being compared to waters, by way of the intermediate ‘unwed girls’ (agrúvaḥ). This is also something of a dig at Vṛtra, who hadn’t managed to make them pregnant though he is sometimes called their husband (cf., e.g., dāsá-patnī- ‘having a Dāsa as husband’ in I.32.11, etc.). Indra’s role as their real husband is embodied in the final word of the vs. dáṃsupatnīḥ (however we interpret the rest of it; see below).

In the simile nabhanvò ná vákvā(ḥ), vákva- belongs to the root √vañc ‘surge, undulate, billow’. The stem nabhanú- is found only here and in V.59.7 and is transparently a derivative of the root √nabh ‘burst, explode’. Old suggests the verbal meaning ‘sich spalten’ with nominal ‘Spalt’(‘split, cleft’). However, in both passages I think the nominal form refers not to the aftermath of the verbal action but rather to the process -- the spurts sent forth by the explosion (rather like the stones in 5b). The image is visually arresting (at least to me).

The sense of dhvasrá- in b also requires some discussion. The root √dhvaṃs is variously glossed (e.g., EWA s.v. ‘zerstieben, zerstäuben, zerbröcklen’), but in my view the ‘spray, scatter’ sense is far less prominent than ‘occlude’ (with smoke, dust, or other concealing substance), a sense also found in derivatives like dhvasmán- ‘miasma, (clouds of) smoke’. Thus to my mind the adj. dvasrá- means in the first instance ‘occluded, dusty’; I have pushed this slightly to ‘parched’, from something like ‘dry as dust’. Ge’s “die dahinschwindenden” (dwindling away) conveys something of the same sense of weakness and lack of fertility, but I don’t know how he arrived at it.

ṛtajñā́ḥ is identified as a nom. sg. m. modifying Indra by Gr, so also Scar (177). It can just as easily be an acc. pl. fem. modifying the young women / waters, as Ge, WG, and the publ. tr. take it. Given that the waters in the adjacent hymn, IV.18.6, are called ṛtā́varīḥ, the latter analysis seems preferable -- although it might be even better to read it with both referents.

The publ. tr. analyzes dáṃsupatnī- as having a first member dáṃsu-, an adjective ‘wondrous’ related to dáṃsas- ‘wondrous power’ (so Gr). However, the prevailing interpr. is that it is either a cmpd dáṃ-supatnī- or a two-word sequence dáṃ *supátnīḥ, with, in either case, a form of dám- ‘house’ (cf. dáṃpati-, pátir dán).

The complex is then to be rendered ‘having a good husband in the house’ vel sim.

Alternatively Ge (n. 7d) suggests that it might be a metathesis of *su-daṃpatnīḥ (given without accent), which seems quite unlikely. Although I think the form plays off dámpati-, I am still inclined towards the ‘wondrous’ interpr., because of the deeds that have just been ascribed to Indra.
