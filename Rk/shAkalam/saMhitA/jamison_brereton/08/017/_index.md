Indra
Irimbiṭhi Kāṇva
15 verses: gāyatrī 1–13, br̥hatī 14, satobr̥hatī 15
Coming at the end of the Indra collection in this self-contained group (VIII.12–18),  this hymn consists of fifteen verses and is thus longer than the two previous hymns.  This over-length, combined with its metrical disunity and the varying use of the  verses in later Vedic ritual, suggests that the “hymn” is actually a composite of  three: verses 1–10, consisting of three tr̥cas plus a final verse; another independent  tr̥ca, verses 11–13; and a final pragātha, verses 14–15. (For details, see Oldenberg  1888: 139 n. 1 and 214 n. 2.)
The first and longest of the three hymns (vss. 1–10) is a straightforward invita tion to soma, urging Indra to make the journey to our sacrifice and promising an  ecstatic immersion in the liquid. There are several striking images toward the end,  especially that of the soma mixed with milk as a woman in disguise going to a ren dezvous (if our interpretation is correct) (vs. 7), and a vivid picture of Indra in the  grip of soma-exhilaration (vs. 8). Only the last verse (10), tacked onto the final tr̥ca,  asks for something in return.
The other two hymns, or hymn fragments, are more opaque. The first (vss.  11–13) begins with a conventional invitation to Indra, but the following two verses  address otherwise unknown men involved in some way in the soma sacrifice. The  final pragātha (vss. 14–15) first gives a praiseful description of the soma drop in verse 14, but ends with yet another unknown man also engaged in the soma sacri fice, who seems to have some success in getting Indra to drink it.
