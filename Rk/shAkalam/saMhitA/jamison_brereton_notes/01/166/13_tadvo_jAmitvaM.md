I take cd as a concrete example of the statement in ab, that the Maruts’ connection with the older generation arises from their favoring its “laud” (śáṃsam -- note that this positively viewed śáṃsa- contrasts with the evil śáṃsa- of 8d). Manu is of course a member of the older generation, and because of his “insight” (ayā́dhiyā́) the Maruts favor him and show themselves to him with all their wondrous qualities.
