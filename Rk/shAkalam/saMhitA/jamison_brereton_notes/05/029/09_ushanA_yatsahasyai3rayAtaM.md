On uśánā as an indeclinable, see my 2007 “Vedic Uśanā Kāvya and Avestan Kauui Usan: On the Morphology of the Names” (Fs. Jasanoff).

On the basis of other mentions of this myth, 2nd du. áyātam must conceal a Vāyav Indraś ca type construction, with the other subject, beside voc. indra, being Kutsa. Cf. nearby dual dvandva indrā-kutsā (V.31.9). The gapping of Kutsa in the first half of the verse is repaired by cd saráthaṃ yayātha, kútsena, with the same root √yā as in áyātam. I do not understand the change in tense stem.
