There is some difference of opinion on the source of the apparent indefinite kuvítsa-, a hapax. Ge (n. 24a) asserts that sasya is the gen. corresponding to sásmin, enclitic after kuvíd (presumably presupposing a notional word space kuvít sasya). But the standard opinion, already registered by Gr (< BR; see also explicitly AiG II.1.327, repeated AiG II.2.924), is that it is derived from the univerbation of a syntactic sequence kuvít sá (roughly “is it indeed this one?”), which is then secondarily inflected. This seems the more likely explanation, and in fact there is such a sequence attested in IV.51.4 kuvít sá. This passage contains a deliberative either/or question “should it be the old course or a new one …?” kuvít sá … sanáyo návo vā yā́maḥ, a context that favors development into an indefinite of the type “someone or other.” In fact, our passage might be more clearly rendered as “to the cattle enclosure of someone or other.”
