The standard tr. take tám as a ref. to Agni, who is then the equivalent in the frame of nemím in the simile; so “bend him here as craftsmen bend a felly.” In the publ. tr. I take the frame/simile relation to be an example of case disharmony, with ā́namasva intransitive/reflexive in the frame (“bend (yourself) here”) and transitive in the simile (“as craftsment bend a felly”). This is based in part on the fact that medial forms of √nam (outside the 1st ps.) are intransitive, and this interpr. also makes better sense of the voc. aṅgiraḥ: in the sg., áṅgiras- is used almost exclusively of Agni and never, as far as I know, of a human poet/priest as it would be here if a poet/priest is the subj. of ā́namasva. But I failed to remember that nemí- is said to be feminine, and therefore tám should not qualify it. I am still unwilling to give up my interpr., however, and would note first that at least in the RV there are no diagnostic passages where nemí- must be feminine, that is, no passages containing unambiguous feminine adjectives modifying it. And as a short -i-stem, it does not look feminine.

So I would claim either that it is being treated as a masc. in this passage or that redactionally initial *tā́ṃ was changed to tám; there are no metrical implications.
