The conjoined phrase avitā́vṛdhé ca is not syntactically parallel in the strict sense, but both the agent noun avitár- and the purpose dative vṛdhé are properly construed with the 2nd sg. copula, subjunctive ásaḥ. For the latter, cf., e.g., I.89.5 … yáthā … ásad vṛdhé, and for the cooccurrence of the two terms VI.33.4 … avitā́ vṛdhé bhūḥ.
