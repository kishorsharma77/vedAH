The parallelism between the two loc. phrases pṛ̥ṣatīṣu śrutā́su (a) and sukhéṣu … rátheṣu (b) seems clear, but this entails that the Maruts are mounted both on their horses and on their chariots. This is a price that most tr. are willing to pay, but Re avoids it at the price of the parallelism, by attaching the dappled females to the chariots: “… qui sont montés sur les chars aisés conduit par les (antilopes) tachetées.” Since the Maruts are clearly astride horses in the next hymn, V.61.3, I think we can have them there here as well.

The person changes between hemistichs from 3rd (ab: yé tasthúḥ) in the rel. cl.

to 2nd (cd: voc. ugrāḥ … vaḥ) in the main cl.. This is hardly unusual in the RV. The standard tr. register this anacoluthon in various ways, WG most sharply, by supplying a main cl. for ab: “(Sie sind es), die …” and separating the two hemistichs into two sentences. This seems unnec.
