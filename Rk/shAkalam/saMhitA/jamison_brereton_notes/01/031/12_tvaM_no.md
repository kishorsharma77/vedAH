The theme of protection gets hammered home by the use of three different roots in this semantic sphere: √pā (pāyúbhiḥ a), √rakṣ (rakṣa b, rakṣamāṇaḥ d), and √trā (trātā́c ).

In the conjoined NP maghónaḥ … tanvàś ca, tanváḥ must be reflexive “(we) ourselves,” despite tanū-kṛ́t, where tanū- refers specifically to the body. In c the standard tr. construe the genitives tókasya .. gávām with trātā́, but I take them with tánaye, which they flank, as in the symmetrical constructions discussed above ad vss. 7 and, possibly, 9.

Pāda d can be seen as a paraphrase of 9b, with ánimēṣaṃ rákṣamāṇaḥ “unblinkingly watchful” an expansion of jā́gṛviḥ “wakeful,” and of 10d, with rákṣamāṇas táva vraté “watchful in accord with your commandment” expanding vratapā́- “protector of the commandment.”
