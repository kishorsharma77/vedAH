The “wide space” theme returns from 2d. The laconic expression of the recipient of wide space in 2d (the dat. súṣvaye ‘for the presser’) is expanded into a dat. pronoun with rel. clause attached: asmai … yá itthéndrāya sómam uśaté sunóti.

Since the first part of this hymn ends with vs. 7, vss. 2 and 6 are symmetrical and this echo forms a small internal ring. But there are no other signs of ring composition.

The tradition (as well as modern ed. and tr.) is split on whether to read ávivenam (HvN, Müller ed., Sāy., Lub, and AiG I.1.333) or ávivenan (Auf. ed., Pp, Gr, Ol, and Ge); see Old’s disc.

Quite apart from the actual form is its referent. Old, who accepts the ávivenan reading, takes c with d and identifies Indra as the referent of ávivenan. Although this fits better with the similar expression in the next hymn (IV.25.3) where gods are (or may be) the subject, here I think Ge is correct that c belongs grammatically with the rel. cl. in ab, and the referent of ávivenan is the soma-presser subject of that rel. cl.

This nominative is resumed by the appropriate correlative prn. tám in the acc. in d.
