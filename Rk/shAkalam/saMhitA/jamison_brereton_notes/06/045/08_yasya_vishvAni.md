Ge takes ūcuḥ to √vac and supplies hitāni with ní: “In dessen Händen … alle Güter, wie man sagt, nieder(gelegt sind),” but Old’s view, that ūcuḥ belongs to √uc, which regularly takes the preverb ní in the meaning ‘be accustomed to, be at home in’, is preferable. (And in fact Ge admits as much in n. 8a.)
