Ge plausibly explains the sg. hávyaḥ as attraction to the number in the simile (sg. muṣṭihā́). One might also add that hávya- is overwhelmingly nom. sg, and there are no masc. pl. forms attested. There seems no obvious reason for such a grammatical restriction, but it may have contributed to the somewhat anomalous form here.

All standard interpr. (including mine) take the simile in b to be vṛ́ṣṇaś candrā́n ná “like lustrous bulls,” despite the displaced simile marker -- in part presumably because “like lustrous/brilliant ones” doesn’t make much sense as a simile. I have no explanation for the placement of ná, nor do I understand why this needs to be a simile at all, since the Maruts are regularly called bulls without such marking (see nearby 19b, e.g., as well as 9-10, 12). Perhaps it indirectly continues the pun in the simile in 19c, which in turn is continued in vs. 21.
