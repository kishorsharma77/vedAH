On the problematic ā́vasā́ā́(Saṃhitā) / ā́ava’saí ā́(Pp.), see detailed disc.

by Scar (576-77), who lays out the various phonological and morphological possibilities. As he points out, the reading of Holland van Nooten, ā́ávasā ā́, with accent on the first a (possible on the basis of the Saṃhitā text) and deaccentuation of the final ā of the noun (contra both Saṃhitā and Pp), makes no sense (and does not conform to the transmitted text). The nominal form between the two ā́’s is by most accounts a root noun cmpd of √sā + áva. The question is what the case form is. I follow Whitney (§971a) and Old in reading -ās, contra the Pp., interpreting it (with Whitney and Old) as an irregular abl. sg. to this root noun cmpd. (expect *avasás) in infinitival usage. The parallelism in the hemistich supports this interpr., but see the other possibilities offered by Scar.
