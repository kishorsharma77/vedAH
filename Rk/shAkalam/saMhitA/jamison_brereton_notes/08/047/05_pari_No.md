The simile is slightly skewed, though, as in English, the case frame with ‘avoid’ works either way. It might be expected that “we” would be compared to the (presumably) nominative rathyàḥ ‘charioteers’, but grammatically “we” are parallel to the hard places (durgā́ṇi). Of course technically both durgā́ṇi and rathyàḥ can be either nom. or acc. pl., so that the skewing could be avoided: “Evils will avoid us, as hard places avoid charioteers.” But this produces an unintentionally comic picture, and I follow Ge and Re in the case distribution.
