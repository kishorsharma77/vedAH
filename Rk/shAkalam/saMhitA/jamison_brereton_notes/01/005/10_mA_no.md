title = "10"

A whiff of ring composition - 10c ī́śānaḥ ‘having control over’ echoes 2b ī́śānam, both modifying Indra. In 2b the god controls something undeniably positive, “choice things,” which he will presumably distribute to this favorites. In 10a he controls “the deadly weapon” that other mortals might wield against us. The identity of expression ties together the very different sentiments.
