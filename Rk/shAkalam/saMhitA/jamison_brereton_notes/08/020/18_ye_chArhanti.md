Syntactic problems continue in this verse. Contra most interpr., I take ab as a continuation of vs. 17, still couched in the 3rd ps., and cd as a new clause directly addressing the Maruts in the 2nd ps. The first hemistich consists of two parallel relative clauses, with the two forms of yé positioned at the extreme ends, opening and closing the half-verse. The clauses are connected by an inverse ca: #yé ca … yé#.

This inversion is phonologically motivated, producing a mirror image figure: #yé cā́rhanti … cáranti yé# (Saṃhitā text, but 1st verb metrically to be read ca árhanti).

There are further problems. árhanti has no expressed object -- unless marútaḥ is taken as acc., with the subj. being unexpressed human worshipers; see Old’s reff.

This seems a thoroughly bad idea, given the rhetorical structure of this pragātha. Ge supplies “zu heissen” (that is, “deserve [to be called]”), which seems a fairly radical addition; Re “notre hommage” (so also Klein, DGRV I.186), which is somewhat easier to justify semantically but for which there is no parallel. My “soma drink” is based on a number of passages where some expression containing pītím ‘drink’ (+/- ‘soma’) serves as obj. of √arh (I.134.6, II.14.2, IV.47.2, V.51.6); this is the most common expressed obj. to √arh.

In b mīḷhúṣaḥ is the problem. Technically speaking, this cannot be a nom. pl.

as I have rendered it. The correct form should be mīḷhvā́ṃsaḥ, which is found only once in the RV, though nearby (VIII.25.14, but not attributed to the same poet). Most take it here as the accusative pl. it appeas to be, referring to the generous (human) patrons whom the Maruts approach (e.g., Ge “und die zu den Lohnherrn insgesamt(?) kommen”). This is certainly possible, but, with Old, I nonetheless take it as a nominative, because the stem is often used of the Maruts, including in this very hymn (3c gen. pl. mīḷhúṣām). The misinterpretation could be aided by passages like VI.66.3 rudrásya yé mīḍhúṣaḥ sánti putrā́ḥ, where the adjective technically modifies gen. sg. Rudra, but could be interpr. as going with nom. pl. putrā́ḥ. Cf. also VII.58.5, which is entirely ambiguous. It is indeed barely possible that mīḷhúṣaḥ here actually is a gen. sg., picking up the rudrásya of 17a, but I think this unlikely. The morphologically weak nom. pl. here might also be favored by phonological motivations, in order to produce a form similar to marútaḥ in the previous pāda in the same metrical position (i.e., immediately preceding a four-syllable cadence).

yúvānaḥ here is a voc.; the identical form in 17c is most likely a nominative.

The acc. to the same stem, yū́naḥ, opens the next vs. (19a).

In d the Saṃhitā vavṛdhvam must be read *vavṛd-dhu vam with both distraction and a heavy root syllable (√vṛt ‘turn’). For a similar situation, see ácidhvam in VIII.7.2, which must be read *ácid-dhu vam (√cit).
