Ge (/WG) supply “bring,” an impv. addressed to Agni, in the first hemistich.

There seems no particularly reason to do so, since the acc. phrase of ab can be construed with áva hvaye in c. Perhaps it’s on the basis of the ā́in pāda a, but this is in the wrong position to be a gapped preverb. I don’t actually know what ā́is doing, but note that in the ring-compositional expressions in vss. 8-9, the ‘call’ verb is construed with ā́.
