The āmreḍita ihéha echoes that in vs. 1, idám-idam, forming a superficial ring. Given the apparent composite nature of the hymn, this apparent ring is presumbly not a sign of a hymn conceived originally as a unity, but perhaps a hasty adjustment to try to integrate the separate pieces.

Pāda c appears to mean “I choose the/your sacrifice” (yajñám … ā́vṛṇe), as in Re’s “je choisis votre sacrifice.” But this doesn’t make a lot of sense in its baldest form. Although ā́√vṛ normally just means ‘choose’, in this passage the ā́appears to be used as it is with √yaj: ā́√yaj means ‘attract through sacrifice’ (sim. ā́√pū ‘attract through purification’), hence my “I will you (to come) here to (my) sacrifice,” that is, I attract you to it by the force of my will.

[VII.60-74 JPB]
