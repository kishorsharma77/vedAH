A difficult hemistich, whose uncertainties include the function of abhí, the meaning of ā́yaman, and the grammatical identity and use of sū́raḥ. Contra Gr I do not take abhí as another preverb with ā́√yam. The only other example of abhí-ā́ √yam is in a gerundive in a curious idiom in an Aśvin hymn (I.34.1). Moreover, if it is a preverb, it has taken an odd position: we generally find preverbs in tmesis at the beginnings of pādas. I instead take it as governing naḥ. As for ā́yaman, it needs to be considered in connection with other ā́√yam forms in this hymn, particularly ā́yamat in 3c (also ā́yatam 7b). In 3c the lexeme means ‘guide’, and I take it so here as well, with naḥ (read twice) as its object. In this interpretation sū́raḥ is ablative of svàr, rather than gen. to this stem (Gr, Old, with the latter suggesting it might be a temporal gen.) or nom. sg. to sū́ra- (Ge).

In c the referent of tát is not specified. Ge thinks it’s the sun, which is certainly possible.
