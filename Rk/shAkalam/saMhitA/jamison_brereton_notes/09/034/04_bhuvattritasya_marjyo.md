On Trita, see comm. ad IX.37.4.

Ge interpr. the rūpaíḥ with which the soma is anointed as its colors (“mit seinen Farben”). However, (sám) √añj is specialized in IX for cows (that is, their milk). Cf. ## 47
yád góbhiḥ ... samajyáse, IX.72.1 sáṃ dhenúbhiḥ ... ajyate; without sám there are multiple passages, e.g., góbhir añjānáḥ ... (IX.50.5, etc.), góbhir ajyase (IX.85.5), and, esp., nearby IX.32.3 átyo ná góbhir ajyate. I therefore think that our passage must refer to “forms” of milk; so also Re in his n., though unusually for him he does not supply it in tr.

(“de formes-concrètes”). That this vs. is sandwiched between two vss. that contain the verb ‘milk’, 3c duhanti, 5b duhaté, further supports this interpr., though in both 3 and 5 the milk is not literal milk, but soma itself.

The publ. tr. does not reflect the possible pun on sám … ajyate that was noted in
