Indra  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
9 verses: paṅkti  
Like the immediately preceding hymn, this one is in paṅkti meter, but here the fifth  pāda, rather than being a refrain, is variable and in one instance (vs. 4) syntactically  connected to what precedes it in the verse. (Otherwise the fifth pāda is syntactically  independent but linked thematically.)  
The strength and power of Indra are the main theme, but it is clear that for the  poet the purpose of Indra’s might is simply to enable him to provide his worshipers  with goods (vss. 2–3, 6–9)—particularly those goods belonging to “the stranger”  (vss. 6, 9), in this case probably a non-sacrificing member of the Ārya community,  which Indra should redistribute to more deserving men. The demands for largesse  become increasingly peremptory, and the quantity of praise given to Indra is rather  limited. One wonders how much success this bid for riches would have met with.
