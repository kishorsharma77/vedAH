The first pāda contains a notable word play. Judging from the number of parallels, the default obj. of √iṣ ‘send’ in IX is ‘speech’; cf. IX.30.1, 64.9, 25, 95.5, and esp. IX.12.6 prá vā́cam índur iṣyati, a pāda identical to ours, save for one consonant: vā́cam versus vā́jam. Although an emendation to *vā́cam has been suggested here (see Old, who rejects it), a word play is far more likely. The poet knew (and knew his audience knew) the idiom vā́cam √iṣ, but substituted the nearly identical vā́jam, which is to be construed with síṣāsan ‘desiring to win’ later in the vs. -- vā́jam being a common obj. to forms of √san ‘win’ and in fact found in the root noun cmpd vāja-sā́in b, immediately after the desid. part. This root noun cmpd “repairs” the apparent vā́jam problem, and in the next vs. the poet provides the expected vā́cam, 5a vācam-īṅkhayám, a 2nd repair strategy.

Ge assigns vidānáḥ to √vid ‘know’ (“der sich auf die Vorschriften, auf die Waffen versteht”), while Re (though see his n.) and the publ. tr. take it to √vid ‘find’ (as a root aor.

part.). I now think either (or both) is/are possible, but that in either case vratā́and ā́yudhā are not separate objects as Ge/Re take them, but an equational phrase (as in the publ. tr.).

That is, Soma’s commandments are his weapons. On the formidable nature of Soma’s vratá-s, cf., e.g., IX.53.3 ásya vratā́ni nā́dhṛ́ṣe “The commandments of this one cannot be ventured against.” As an alt. tr. here I would add “knowing his commandments to be his weapons.”
