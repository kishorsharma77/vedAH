The phonologically marked (plain b) name bṛ́ṣaya- is found elsewhere only in I.93.4, where his offspring (there called śéṣaḥ ‘remainder’) are destroyed as they are here. That is also the vs. that contains the parallel passage cited above ad vs. 1.

Although I.93 is a hymn to Agni and Soma and there are no clear connections between the hymns otherwise, at the very least we can probably assume that Bṛṣa was a paṇí-. I do not understand why víśva- modifies this PN: “every Bṛṣaya” meaning Bṛṣaya and his ilk? his kin? (MLW adds “In Latin a name can be used in the plural to mean ‘people like X’ Multi Mani Ariciae ‘There are many manius types at Aricia’ This is no doubt a universal.”) Or does this imply that the word is not a PN, but a meaningful descriptor of a foe? Acdg. to Klein (DGRV I.434-35), the 2nd hemistich begins with an ex. of inverse utá, conjoining the clauses of c and d though positioned at the beginning of c.

Although this is probably the default explan., I am drawn to Re’s more content-rich suggestion that utá sets up the contrast between the very different actions of c and d—though under that analysis we might expect a contrastively accented verb in c (*ávindaḥ), and, moreover, he gives no parallel passages in which utá has such a function.

The hapless ‘them’ (ebhyaḥ) in d must be the ‘god-scorners’ (deva-níd-) of a, as is the general consensus.
