The function of the ca in b is unclear. Klein (DGRV I.256-57) discusses three possible explanations - Ge’s, Re’s, and one of his own - of which he prefers Re’s: that marútvate ca conceals an ellipsis “(for the Maruts) and (for Indra) accompanied by the Maruts,” which seems by far the least likely and the most cumbersome. Among other things, the Maruts barely figure in IX (though cf. vs. 20 below), and I also know of no passages containing marútvant- that also contain a free form of marút-. My solution is admittedly makeshift but simpler, that cs conjoins the disharmonious dhā́rayā “in a stream” and marútvate … matsaráḥ “exhilarating drink for Indra.” This is closest to Ge’s, criticized by Klein as assuming “a harsh conjunction in pādas a and b.”
