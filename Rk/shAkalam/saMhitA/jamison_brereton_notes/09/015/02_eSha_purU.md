The phrase dhiyā́yāty (with non-vocalic -y in yāty) “drives with insight” in 1a is echoed by the verb dhiyāyate “exercises his insight” in 2a, though in different metrical positions. dhiyāyate also participates in another phonetic figure, with the final word of b: (dhi)yāyate / (devá)tātaye, with the same vowel pattern, but crossed consonants (y y t / t t y).

Denom. dhiyāyáte is of odd formation, presumably built to the instr., which makes it seem context-generated (from dhiyā́in 1a), but there is unfortunately another form to the stem (dat. part. I.155.1 dhiyāyaté), as well as a related -yú-adjective, dhiyāyú- (I.8.6). Still I think generation in this context is likely.

Pāda c contains another mirror-image phonetic figure: (amṛ́)tāsa āsat(e).
