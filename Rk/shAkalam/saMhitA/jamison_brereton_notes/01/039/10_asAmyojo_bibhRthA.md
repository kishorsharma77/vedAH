This verse shows a type of ring composition with vs. 1, in sense though not vocabulary. The hymn begins (1b) with a shooting/throwing metaphor, śocír ná mā́nam ásyatha “(when) you cast your measure/bellowing like a flame.” The last pāda of the hymn (10d) makes the shooting image more pointed: íṣuṃ ná sṛjata dvíṣam “you launch your enmity like an arrow.” The “shooting” verb √as of 1b is replaced by more generic √sṛj ‘launch, release’, but the simile specifies an arrow, rather than the potentially destructive but less specific ‘flame’. The responsion between these two expressions may give added support to the interpretation of śocíḥ as an accusative in vs. 1; see discussion there.
