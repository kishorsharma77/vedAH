Maruts  
Nodhas Gautama  
14 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 15  
Exuberant in language and crammed with vivid description, this hymn treats the  usual Marut themes. The poet begins by exhorting himself to produce a worthy  and well-crafted hymn for these gods (vs. 1), and proceeds to do just that. Verses  2–4 describe the Maruts’ birth and beauty, while verses 5–8 turn to their role in  the thunderstorm, with comparisons to various wild animals found in verses 7–8.  Verse 9 is a pun on the word ródasī, which in the first half of the verse is in the dual number and refers to the two world-halves, while in the second half it must refer to  the goddess Rodasī (usually differently accented rodasī́), the regular consort of the  Maruts. (For the same pun, see I.167.4, also in a Marut hymn.) Further description  of their boisterous behavior occupies verses 10–11.  
In verse 12 the poet returns to the beginning, by referring to the hymn “we” are  offering to the Maruts. Reestablishing the relationship between the mortal worship ers and the Maruts allows him to make the transition to the boons we ask of them.  After providing a model of the fortunate man who receives the Maruts’ aid in verse  13, the poet calls on the gods to grant good things to the patrons and the worshipers  in general (vss. 14–15).
