This vs. recalls the námas- vs. (8), with its two occurrences of ā́vivase, one of which is construed with instr. námasā. Here we have the verb form ā́name, which imitates ā́vivase in preverb and med. 1st sg. form, but with the verbal root from which námas- is derived, √nam ‘bow, bend’. It also is construed with an instr. of the s-stem, námobhiḥ.
