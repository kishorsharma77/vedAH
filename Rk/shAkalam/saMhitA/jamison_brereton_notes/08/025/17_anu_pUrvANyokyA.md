Flg. Kü I take the pf. of √sac as presential in value.

sāmrājyásya is in the same position as sā́mrājyāya ‘sovereign kingship’ in 8b but differently accented. The form here must be an adj. ‘related to sovereign kingship’. This makes sense: its referent, the Sun, is not a sovereign king himself, but associated, as their eye and spy, with Mitra and Varuṇa, who are.

The form of dīrghaśrút is problematic. It appears to be a nom. sg., but the subj.

of this sentence is plural (“we”). Gr takes it as a neut. pl. modifying vratā́, as do Ge (without comment) and Re; Scar identifies it as a neut. pl. but with a query. AiG III.65-66 suggests that it follows the model of short neut. plural forms that are identical to the neut. singular belonging to other stems (type nā́ma ‘name(s)’). I think we can sympathize with the plight of a poet who’s trying to figure out how to make a neut. pl. out of a root noun ending in -t: it’s simply impossible. In VII.16.8 we get śárma dīrghaśrút#. Since śárma there could technically be plural (and there were presumbly other such expressions with neut. n-stems, etc.), it’s not hard to see the poet assuming, rightly or wrongly, that -śrút can be a neut. pl. Old also adduces 61.2 vípro mánmāni dīrghaśrút, where the adj. modifies nom. sg. vípraḥ but could be interpr. as going with mánmāni.
