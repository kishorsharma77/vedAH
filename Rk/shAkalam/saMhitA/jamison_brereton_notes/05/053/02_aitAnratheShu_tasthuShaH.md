In b kathā́yayuḥ could be resolved as kathā́ā́yayuḥ “how did they drive here?” This interpr. might be favored by āyayúḥ in 3a, although it is disfavored by prá yayuḥ in 12b.

The sandhi form āpáya at the end of c is universally interpr. as the nom. pl.

āpáyaḥ, referring to the Maruts; it could, however, be just as easily dat. sg. āpáye and refer to the good giver (sudā́se) immediately preceding. In fact, I think it should be read as both, as reflected in the publ. tr. This double reading is favored by the way the vs. is structured, a striking pattern discovered by Natalie Operstein (in class, early 2000s). In general in this verse syntactic constituency is alternating and interlocked -- that is, constituents have the pattern X Y X’ Y’, etc. So, pāda a: ā́ rátheṣu  etā́n tasthúṣaḥ with the acc. pl. etā́n … tasthúṣaḥ interrupted by the loc. pl. rátheṣu, which is governed by ā́preceding the acc. pl. The pattern is similar in cd: kásmai sudā́se íḍābhir sahá sasruḥ ánv vr̥ṣṭáyaḥ āpáya The datives kásmai … sudā́se form a constituent, interrupted by the 3rd pl. verb sasruḥ, whose preverb ánu follows the dat. sudā́se and whose overt subj., nom. pl.

vṛṣṭáyaḥ itself interrupts the postpositional phrase íḍābhiḥ … sahá. In this configuration āpáya is not definitively paired: it could go with dat. sudā́se, separated from it by the prev. ánu, or with the nom. pl. vṛṣṭáyaḥ, likewise separated from it by a single word, instr. ídābhiḥ. Note also that it is the final word of a 12-syllable pāda, in a verse whose other pādas are 8-syllables, so it is metrically almost isolated and could almost (not quite -- it’s only 3 syllables) attach itself to d rather than c. Since āpí- ‘friend’ is an inherently receiprocal word, its double application is especially appropriate.
