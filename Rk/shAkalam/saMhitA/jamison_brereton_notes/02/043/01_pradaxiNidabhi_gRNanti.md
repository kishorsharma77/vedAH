Again as in II.42.3, pradakṣiṇít might refer to ‘south’, rather than ‘right’, though the idiom prá + dakṣiṇá- seems more limited to the traditional circumambulation of the fire with the right side facing inward.

Pāda c is somewhat oddly phrased. The vocalizer is identified as a sāmansinger, but is said to speak (both) speech(es). This raises several questions: does a singer speak? and what are “both speeches”? It is tempting to equate the two speeches with the two entities in pāda d, gāyatrám and traiṣṭubham, but I am not certain that is correct. I think it’s possible that “both speeches” refers to the words and the melody. As for the question of singing versus speech, I wonder if the simile sāmagā́iva should go rather with d than with c: “It speaks both speeches. Like a sāman-singer it regulates both Gāyatrī and Triṣṭubh meters.” Unfortunately this hymn is so isolated in the RV that we have no points of comparison.
