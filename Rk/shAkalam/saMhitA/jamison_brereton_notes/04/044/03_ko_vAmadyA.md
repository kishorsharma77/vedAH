The standard tr. take the dative phrase in c, ṛtásya … vanúṣe pūrvyā́ya as personal (e.g., Ge “für den, der schon früher des rechten Brauches beflissen war”).

But since this phrase is parallel to two purpose-activity datives in b (ūtáye … sutapéyāya) and is in fact conjoined with them by vā, I think they should be parallel in function. Old sees the problem and suggests that if we interpr. the passage as I do, we might need to read *vánuṣe -- though he ultimately opts for the personal dative.
