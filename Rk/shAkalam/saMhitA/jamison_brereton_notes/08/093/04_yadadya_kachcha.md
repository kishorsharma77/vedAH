The two vocatives addressed to Indra, vṛtrahan (a) and indra (c), flank that to the sun (sūrya, b), with the first embedded in a 2nd ps. clause with Sūrya as subject.

Only the unambiguous reference of vṛtrahan to Indra saves it from being applied to Sūrya, but the effect is still somewhat unsettling.

The verb udágāḥ reprises úd … eṣi expressing the same action in vs. 1. In fact 1a #ud ghéd abhí is echoed by 4b #udágā abhí with the actual verb agā́(ḥ) substituting for the intervening particles of the former.
