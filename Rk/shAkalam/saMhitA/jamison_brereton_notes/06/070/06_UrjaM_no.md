On the grammatical pun that accounts for the disjoining of the dual dvandva dyā́vā-pṛthivī́, see comm. ad vs. 1. This disjoining is somewhat reminiscent of the same move in the previous hymn, where the dvandva índrā-víṣṇū appears in every vs. except the last, where not only are the two gods separated (índraś ca viṣṇo), but contend with each other. There is no contention here, but the grammatical shift is the same.
