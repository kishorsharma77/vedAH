This verse displays a type of “poetic repair”: the first hemistich has a grammatical subject that is ordinarily inanimate (ūtáyaḥ ‘[forms of] help’) with a verb that ought to have a personal subject (abhí .. avanvan ‘they attained to / gained’), with an object possessing a number of qualities, but unnamed; the third pāda solves this slight puzzle by giving names to both: the subject is the Ṛbhus, the object Indra.

The spatial contrast in b between filling the midpace, but being himself enclosed by his own powers (muscle-bound?) is nice.

jávana- occurs only here in the RV, but the -ana-suffix ordinarily makes transitive nominals (pace Ge’s “raschhandeln,” Re’s “véloce”).
