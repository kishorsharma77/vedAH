In b Ge (/WG) and Thieme (Gedichte 31) take the instr. sumatíbhiḥ as the object of sám ānaṃśa (e.g., Ge “Wer wurde seiner Gnaden teilhaft?”), but this seems an unlikely use of the instr., even with the presence of the preverb sám -- esp.

because the verb in b is essentially identical to the verb in a, āpa, which takes the acc. Although Gr allows both acc. and instr. with sám √naś in the sense ‘erlangen’, a careful perusal of the entry shows that this is the only instance with a supposed instr.; the others have the acc. I therefore supply the same obj. found in pāda a (sadhamā́dam) and take sumatíbhiḥ in normal instr. usage.

The second hemistich contains two occurrences of kád; the second is taken by all as simply a question marker, but Ge interprets the first one as a full neut. with citrám, “welches Wunder?” This is possible, but it seems rhetorically better to take it as parallel in function to the other kád (so Th and WG as well as me). I supply ‘course’ on the basis of II.34.10 citráṃ tád vo maruto yā́ma cekite “This bright course of yours, Maruts, appears ever more brightly,” also adduced by Ge. The notion of a journey is reinforced by the 2nd part of the hemistich. However, a tr. like WG “Ist sein Glanzzeichen bemerkt?” is certainly possible.
