Ge (and in part Re) take mádhumat as referring to speech (“… wurden beredt in süssen (Worten)”), but though mádhumant- occurs several times with vácas- and the noun vípra- ‘inspired poet’ demonstrates that √vip ‘become inspired’ can have a strong verbal component, still the focus of this hymn is soma -- and the default referent of mádhumant- ‘honeyed’ is soma. Here the underlying word must be neut. (which sóma- of course is not), but the neut. sávana- ‘pressing’ is found elsewhere with this adj. (cf. X.112.7 mádhumattamāni … sávanā), and sávana- is found three times in the first five vss. of this hymn (1b, 3c, 5a). Note the insistent repetition of ma in pāda d (amarmáṇo mányamānasya márma), anticipated by mádhumad in a and marútaḥ in b, and continued by the first word in 5a manuṣvád. This phonetic figure may be signaling the Maruts’ name. See also vs. 7.
