ácidhvam in b (see also the identical pāda in 14b) should be read with distracted final syllable (ácidhu vam) in order to make up an 8-syllable pāda, but it also should ideally have a heavy root syllable in order to avoid four consecutive light syllables in the cadence. (Even though I do not believe that the cadences of dimeter verse are as regulated as those in trimeter, iambic cadences do prevail, and four shorts would be quite unusual.) Werba (183, flg. Seebold) suggests that the form represents *ácid-dhu vam to √cit, which seems very plausible (also for the identical distracted form in I.87.2; in V.55.7 it does not require distraction and is therefore not diagnostic). Gr assigns ácidhvam to √ci, which is nearly identical in meaning to √cit; Lubotsky, curiously, puts it with √ci ‘pile’. The same type of cluster reduction is found in the Marut hymn VIII.20.18 in vavṛdhu vam, which likewise requires distraction and a heavy root syllable and represents *vavṛd-dhu vam from √vṛt ‘turn’.
