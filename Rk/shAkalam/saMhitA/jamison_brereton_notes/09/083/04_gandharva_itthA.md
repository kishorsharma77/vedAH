For my view of the Gandharva as another instantiation of soma/the sun see publ. intro. This more or less agrees with Ge (n. 4a: the sun, acdg. to Sāy.) and Re (Soma-Gandharva). I do not see this vs. as referring to the Somaraub as Ober does (II.162).

As indicated in the publ. intro., with the 2nd hemistich we return to the world of ritual and to the filter specifically.

nidhā̇́- clearly means ‘snare’; see the other occurrence in X.73.11 nidháyeva baddhā́n “bound as if by a snare.” But the semantic dev. from the presumed source ní √dhā is not clear. That lexeme generally means ‘set down, deposit, keep safe/secure’. Perhaps ‘snare’ develops from this last meaning: a device used to secure an object. On this problem see detailed disc. by Scar (255). It would be nice to connect it with ní √dā ‘bind’, but pesky phonology gets in the way.
