The anomalous 3rd pl. vidánti, to the thematic aorist ávidat, is the only apparent primary indicative form to this stem and should belong to a present.

However, I think it can be eliminated: rather than following the Pp. vidánti īm, we can instead read vidánt īm, an injunctive with secondary ending whose final -t was preserved in this ambiguous sandhi situation. No alteration of the text is required.

The publ. tr. need not be altered either, though a preterital interpretation is in fact better: “They found him there when they recited mantras…” - since this passage appears to refer to the mythological tale of the gods finding Agni hidden in the waters. Cf. I.72.2 (also a Parāśara product), where the immortals did not find him (ná vindan) though they sought him; they are also described as dhiyaṃdhā́-, as here. For this and other such passages (esp. I.65.4 and I.85.11), see my “Hidden in Plain Sight: Some Older Verb Endings in the Rig Veda” in a forthcoming festschrift.
