The grammar of this vs. is quite straightforward; what difficulty it presents lies in the uncertain and permeable boundary between PNs and common noun/adjectives. In b vibhvataṣṭā́ḥ, modifying the rivers, is universally taken as containing the PN Vibhvan, hence ‘fashioned by Vibhvan’. Since the referents of pāda a are the Ṛbhus and Vibhvan is the name of an Ṛbhu, this makes some contextual sense. However, fashioning a river seems beyond even the Ṛbhus’ expertise, and, further, in VI.61.13 Sarasvatī, a river after all, is vibhváne kr̥tā́“made for wide extension / wide ranging.” I think that sense is meant here as well, and there is simply some sly play on the Ṛbhu’s name.

I am less certain about what to do with bṛhaddivā́in c. In the immediately preceding hymn (V.41.19) I take the same form as an attributive adjective with urváśī: Urvaśī Bṛhaddivā “Urvaśī of lofty heaven.” Here it could likewise be attributive to Sarasvatī or it could be a separate goddess. See Klein (I.328-29, 337) on this mild dilemma. If Bṛhaddivā is a distinct entity, she is featureless, so there is little at stake here.
