Unlike other interpretors, I take utá as marking a new clause, summing up the actions of the poet (who addresses himself in 2a) and his ritual companions (whom he addresses in vs. 1) and comparing them to the actions of the Maruts (yáthā náraḥ). Klein (I.409) takes utá as connecting vss. 1 and 2, but the position of utá in 2b makes that interpretation awkward. Ge takes it as connecting ukthám and dyukṣám (“… ein Loblied … und zwar ein himmlisches”). His interpretation assumes a new clause beginning with yáthā in the middle of b and also takes cakṛmā́in c as a sort of 34 dummy verb substituting for a verb of poetic speech (“wie wir Männer es … gedichtet haben”). But, although “just as we have done” works fine in English as a dummy verb, I am not sure that √kṛ can be bleached in the same manner in Sanskrit

- though I notice, with some chagrin, that I suggest just such an explanation for
kṛṇóti in I.77.1. Since the Maruts as Indra’s singers are mentioned elsewhere in the hymn (explicitly vs. 8, implicitly vs. 12) and are often called náraḥ, my interpretation of b has some support. The position of yáthā as a simile marker might be problematic, however; it can be ameliorated by assuming that dyukṣám forms part of the simile “as the superior men (made/make) a heavenly (speech), we have made …” For dyukṣá- qualifying ‘speech’, cf. the compound dyukṣá-vacas- (VI.15.4).
