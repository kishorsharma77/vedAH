For sugá- supátha- see vs. 1.

Ge suggests that avāté “(even) when it is windless” describes a wonder, that Dawn crosses the water even without wind in her sails. I am not sure what evidence we have for sails, in addition to oars, in ancient Indian boats, but I have not systematically inquired into this. However, the “windless” circumstances might simply make reference to the previous pāda: the waters are also sugá- ‘easy to travel’ when there is no wind and therefore no turbulence. The word avāté also plays off the descriptor of Dawn in the next vs. (5a), ávātā ‘unsurpassable, unvanquished’; Old in fact suggests that we might read *ávāte, voc. of the latter stem, though a word play is much more satisfying poetically, and he does not dismiss the ‘windless’ interpr. out of hand.
