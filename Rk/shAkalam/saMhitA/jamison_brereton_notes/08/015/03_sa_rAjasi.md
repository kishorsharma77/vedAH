By the rules established in Jamison 1992 for sá with 2nd ps. reference, sá rājasi here is in violation. But notice that this line (sá rājasi puruṣṭutam̐, éko vṛtrā́ṇi jighnase) is twinned with 11ab satrā́tvám puruṣṭutam̐, éko vṛtrā́ṇi tośase, which begins with satrā́, phonologically like our sá rā ... Also note ví rājasi in 5c, which could invoke a *sáṃ rājasi here (which would change the meter, but not improperly).

For sám √rāj / ví √rāj, see I.188.5 virā́ṭ samrā́ṭ ... And note that samrā́jam is the second word of the next hymn (VIII.16.1).
