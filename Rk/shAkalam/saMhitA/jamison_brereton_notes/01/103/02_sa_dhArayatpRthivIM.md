The presence of the shadowy Rauhiṇa here (otherwise only II.12.12) is an intrusion in this Vṛtra-oriented verse. The verb that governs him, ví √bhid ‘split apart’, returns in the next verse with ‘strongholds” as its object. The distraction of verb and preverb with object in the middle (ábhinad rauhiṇáṃ ví) is almost iconic for the splitting apart. For a potentially similar ex. see V.30.7.
