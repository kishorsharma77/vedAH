The identify of the mánavaḥ in c is not clear. I take it as a continuation of the description of the Maruts, though it is the case that mánu- and its derivatives do not otherwise characterize the Maruts. Ge (/WG) suggests that it refers to men who have become gods or been assimilated to the gods, like the Ṛbhus, while Re thinks c belongs with d and refers to the All Gods, though this explanation runs into the same problem as the Marut identification.
