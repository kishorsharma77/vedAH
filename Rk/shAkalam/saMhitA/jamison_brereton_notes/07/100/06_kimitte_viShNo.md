Exactly what this vs. is trying to tell us is unclear. Most tr. and comm. take paricákṣya- as referring to something blameworthy (tadelnswert); so, e.g., Ge (“Was war an dir zu tadeln …?”), Old, KH (Injunc. 78-79). But the other example of this gerundive in VI.52.14 modifies vácas- specifically and seems to mean ‘to be disregarded, overlooked’: mā́vo vácāṃsi paricákṣyāṇi vocam “let me not speak words to you that can be disregarded.” Esp. because the verb in the dependent cl.

belongs to √vac, pf. vavakṣé, it seems reasonable to supply ‘speech’ here as well.

The point seems to be that we should have paid attention when he called himself Śipiviṣṭa, and that even when he appears in other form(s), he should not keep the form of Śipiviṣṭa concealed from us, any more than we should not notice the name.

But what these statements are in service of, I have no idea -- and the hymn ends here (save for the repeated vs. 7, which, however, makes a point of addressing Viṣṇu as Śipiviṣṭa).
