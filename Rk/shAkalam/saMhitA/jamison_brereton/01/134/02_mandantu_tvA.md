Let the invigorating drops invigorate you, Vāyu, as they are being  prepared by us, well-prepared, heaven-bound—being prepared with  cows [=milk], heaven-bound.
When his help, being prepared in order to succeed, follows his skill,
our teams, our poetic thoughts are directed toward a single goal, toward  giving—our poetic thoughts call upon him [=Vāyu] (for giving).
