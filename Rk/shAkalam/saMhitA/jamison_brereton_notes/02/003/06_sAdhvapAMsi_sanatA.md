In b vayyèva belongs to a vṛkī́-type stem vayī́- ‘weaver’, here in the dual. Old suggests that it doesn’t really matter if we analyze it as vayí yā iva, with masc. du., or vayí ye (i)va with fem. du., but given that the other adjectives in the hemistich, ukṣité … raṇvité, are feminine in form and that uṣā́sanáktā is regularly fem., the latter seems more likely.

The vs. lacks a finite verb and there is no verbal form, finite or participial, to govern ápāṃsi ‘labors’ in a. Most tr. supply ‘work’ vel sim., but I think it’s possible that sādhú is an adverbial predicate, “on target” in the publ. tr., and that it loosely governs ápāṃsi.
