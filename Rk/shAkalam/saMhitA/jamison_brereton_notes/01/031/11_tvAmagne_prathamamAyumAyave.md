On Āyu and Iḍā see disc. ad vs. 4 above. This verse clearly refers to the primal institution of the ritual fire at the Ārya sacrifice, but the details are somewhat obscure.

Because of the tense differences between c and d (augmented impf. akṛṇvan vs. pres. jā́yate), I follow Re in taking d as the content of Iḍā’s instruction, namely that in mundane current-day terms Agni/ritual fire has a mere human father, the sacrificer, though it was the gods who originally created him/it.

I would now tr. mánuṣasya as “of Manu,” since this refers to the original establishment of the sacrifice.
