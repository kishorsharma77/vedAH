I follow Ge’s suggestion (in n. to 15a, followed by WG) that the unexpressed subject that is being conceded to Indra is the soma-drink. The parallel he adduces, V.29.5, contains the gods, the soma-drink, the concession, and Etaśa: ádha krátvā maghavan túbhyaṃ devā́ánu víśve adaduḥ somapéyam yát sū́ryasya harítaḥ pátantīḥ puráḥ satī́r úparā étaśe káḥ Then according to your will, o bounteous one, all the gods conceded the soma-drinking to you, when you put the flying golden mares of the Sun behind, though they were in front, in Etaśa('s presence).

In the publ. tr. I take eṣām as a genitival agent, somewhat reluctantly. However, ET suggests a much more attractive solution, which rescues the syntax: that eṣā́m is dependent on asmaí “just to this one of them [=gods].” The singularity of Indra would then be emphasized by the ékaḥ that begins the next pāda.

Etaśa is the horse of the Sun and is not, as far as I know, a soma-presser (the physical image is a little comical). Against all tr., I therefore do not take súṣvim in d as coreferential with étaśam in c, but rather as a second object with the verb. Nodhas is now juggling the mythic past (the aiding of Etaśa) and the desired future (the aiding of the soma-presser), as he nears the end of the hymn. I read the participle paspṛdhānám twice, once with each object, with a different desired goal in the locative for each. I also give the verb āvat two simultaneous morphological analyses, fitting its two objects: the first as augmented imperfect to the Class I present ávati, the second as perfect subjunctive to the pf. ā́va (cf. āpas, āpat taken by Hoffmann 1967: 64 n. 102, 101 n. 220, and Kümmel 2000: 118 as subjunctives to pf. ā́pa √āp ‘attain’). Although such an interpretation might be too artificial in some cases, I have no hesitation in assuming Nodhas is capable of this.

Another phonetic play: d saúvaśvi ye súṣvim
