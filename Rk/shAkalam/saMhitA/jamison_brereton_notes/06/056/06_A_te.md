The publ. tr. implies that both ‘well-being’ (acc. svastím) and ‘wholeness’ (dat. sarvátātaye) are the complements of īmahe ‘we beg’, and in fact I think that is the intent of the passage, however loose the syntax. But it might be possible to construe the dat. with ‘well-being’: “we beg you for well-being to completeness,” i.e., for well-being in its entirety.
