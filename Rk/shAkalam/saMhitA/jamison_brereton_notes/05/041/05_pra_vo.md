The first hemistich consists of a syntactically “active” 2nd pl. verb (‘present!’ prá … bharadhvam, though it is morphologically middle) paired with a passive (‘should be produced’ dadhīta) without overt agent, structurally similar to vs. 3 with a passive infinitive (huvádhyai) without agent and the same “active” 2nd pl. prá … bharadhvam. This structure is further reminiscent of vs. 1 with passive and act. uses of the same infinitive dé.

In this vs. it is not altogether clear who the 2nd pl. subject of prá bharadhvam is. Ge thinks this is about the dakṣiṇā and suggests as subj. either the Opferveranstalter or the Maruts. I don’t see the dakṣiṇā connection, and given the reciprocal relationship between gods and men depicted already in the hymn (vss. 1 and 3), in the next vs. (6) with dhiyé dhuḥ playing off dadhīta dhī́ḥ in our 5b, and elsewhere, I think it likely that the 2nd pl. addressees here are the (All) Gods in general, who are asked to provide tangible wealth in exchange for the praise embodied in the dhī́- ‘visionary thought’ produced by the poets. The use of the exact same verb prá bharadhvam in 3 and 5, with opposite but complementary subjects (priest-poets / gods), is a neat reversal.

The standard tr. take auśijásya as a PN and construe it with hótā. This is not impossible, but since, as we’ve seen, the poet is fond of using -ya-deriv. adjectives for nouns, I think it more likely that it stands for uśij- ‘(type of) priest’ in the pl.

Assuming as usual, that the Hotar is Agni, who mediates between men and gods, it is reasonable that he would be pleased both by the activities of this priestly group and by those of the gods, represented by the Maruts. For the association of Hotar and auśijá- see also IV.21.6-7, though that passage is exceptionally opaque.

The vs. contains several instances of phonological and morphological play. In b the pāda-final phrase dadhīta dhī́ḥ shows tight phonological similarity though the two words belong to different roots. The same play is found in the next vs. (6d), likewise pāda-final, in dhiyé dhuḥ -- same noun dhī́-, verb to the same root √dhā -- though the phonological relationship is not as tight. In 5b dadhīta dhī́ḥ yields a very bad Triṣṭubh cadence, whereas 6d dhiyé dhuḥ provides a completely orthodox cadence. This may be an example of metrical poetic repair, where the metrical violation of the first calls attention to the phrase, which is satisfactorily resolved in the next vs. In the second hemistich we find # (suś)éva éva(ir) ... # (y)é va évā, evoking (d)eva- again. Pāda d lacks a syllable. It is tempting to emend the opening to yé *vā va évā, given the prominence of vā in the hymn -- as Old also suggests. But this emended sequence makes less sense and also disturbs its phonological echo of pāda c.

It should also be noted that yé va évā is also found in 13a in a different metrical position and cf. also scrambled evayā́in 16b. If *vā were to be inserted, the tr. could be changed to “is well disposed because of the ways of the … Priests or (those) which are the ways of you powerful ones, o Maruts.”
