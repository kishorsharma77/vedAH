Agni  
Uśanā Kāvya  
9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
This short and simple hymn to Agni makes no reference to his fiery qualities,  and only glancing ones to his ritual role: as guest in our houses (vs. 1) set here  by the gods (vs. 2). The most salient aspect of the hymn is the series of ques tions it contains: in the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) the poet asks what services we  should perform for Agni and how we should perform them (vss. 4–5); the final  tr̥ca (vss. 7–10) again begins with a question (vs. 7), this time about which poet  is the recipient of Agni’s poetic stimulation. The poet is clearly concerned  with producing the proper praise for the god; he mentions hymns or praises in  verses 3–7.  
The Anukramaṇī names as the poet the legendary and mythic figure Uśanā Kāvya, to whom the three hymns IX.87–89 are also attributed. It is not clear why,  save for the mention of the kaví “sage poet” in verse 2.
