I take ádrogham adverbially with Gr and (apparently) Re, while Ge supplies an acc. of the 1st sg. pronoun to serve as goal for ā́vaha: “(Zu mir), der ohne Falsch ist, fahre …” The accent, against adj. adroghá-, may support an adverbial interpr.

hitáḥ is ambiguous: it can belong either to √dhā ‘place’ (see súdhitā in c) or √hi ‘impel’, and both may be meant. It also plays off immediately preceding dhītíbhiḥ, though it cannot belong to √dhī.
