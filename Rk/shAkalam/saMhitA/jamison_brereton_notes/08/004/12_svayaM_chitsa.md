title = "12"

The last pāda echoes 8d, with the same three abrupt imperatives in the same order: éhi (prá) dravā píba, but in 12d the initial tásya needs to be construed with the final imperative píba. On this as a quasi-serial-verb construction, see Yates 2014 [UCLA conf. vol.]. On the sandhi of tásya + éhi as tásyéhi (not *tásyaíhi), see Old ad loc. and ad I.9.1.
