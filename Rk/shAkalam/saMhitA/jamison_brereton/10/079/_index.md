Agni  
Agni Saucīka or Agni Vaiśvānara or Sapti Vājambhara  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn begins with a 1st-person vision (“I have seen...”) and in its middle verse  (4) announces a truth, again in the 1st person—though the speaker disclaims real  discernment for himself, while ascribing it to the god Agni. Such rhetorical moves  are typical of omphalos hymns, but the mystery in this hymn seems less profound  than the structure in which it is embedded seems to promise. It is simply the com  
mon trope of Agni as an insatiable eater, with a nice twist in verse 6, where the poet  commiserates with Agni for having, because of imagined sins, to eat without teeth.  Although the supposed enigma of this hymn is not particularly enigmatic, the style  is lively and the images sharp.
