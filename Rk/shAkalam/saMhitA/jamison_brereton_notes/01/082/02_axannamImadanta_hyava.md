Most tr. take the two verbs ákṣann ámīmadanta as parallel (e.g., Ge “Sie haben ja geschmaust, gezecht”), but the position of the hí after the second verb strongly suggests that the second verb belongs to a separate clause that provides the causal grounds for another clause. My translation reflects this: “for they have brought themselves to exhilaration” explains what “they have eaten” actually refers to: the consumption of soma or soma plus food-offerings. Then in b, as a consequence of their having received nourishment from us, they repay us with goods.

Most tr. take priyā́(ḥ) in b as nom. pl. masc. referring to the Maruts; this requires supplying an object for adhūṣata (e.g., Re “des biens”). I take it rather as an acc. pl. fem., implicitly referring to a fem. noun like íṣaḥ ‘refreshments’; cf. X.134.3 áva tyā́bṛhatī́r íṣaḥ … dhūnuhi “shake down these lofty refreshments,” with the same VP.

With Old, etc., víprā must be a fem. instr. sg. modifying matī́.
