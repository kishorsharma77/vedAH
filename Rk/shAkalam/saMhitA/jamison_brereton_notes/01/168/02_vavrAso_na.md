For the image in pāda a see the publ. intro.

The point of the simile in the final pāda is somewhat obscure. The frame -- “to be extolled by the mouth” (āsā́… vándyāsaḥ) -- is unimpeachable, referring to the poet’s oral praise, but why would gods be compared to cows and/or oxen for this quality? Surely the Maruts are inherently more praiseworthy than cows! Ge suggests that it’s like the praise of bovines at work (like the horses in I.27.1, though this passage does not seem similar); WG tr. “(sie sind) die Kühe mit dem Mund, wie die zu lobenden Jungstiere” and suggest that such cows are esp. sichtlich. This interpr.

loses the connection with the poet’s praise “by mouth” and, at least to me, doesn’t make much sense as a way to refer to particularly visible cows. I suggest that there’s an imperfect pun here on vándya-, which is phonologically close to bándhya- ‘to be bound’ (not found in the RV or, acdg. to Wh Rts, till epic, but easy enough to generate, and the stem occurs in the name of the anūbandhyā cow, a fixture in śrauta ritual, already in the BYV Saṃhitās). The simile would then pivot on the verbal pun, not on the visual image, with “by mouth” used in two different senses with vándyaand *bandhya-. In the latter case, it evokes a halter, the assemblage of straps that go behind the animal’s ears, across the jaws, and around the muzzle, to enable it to be led. The “bound” image adds another layer of meaning to the verse, suggesting under the surface that we can exert control over the Maruts, bind them to us, by praising them.

One small issue is whether gā́vaḥ … ukṣánaḥ is a single compound NP or two different entities. Ge suggests the possibility of the former in his n. 2d, though his tr.

does not reflect it. The position of the simile particle would be slightly better if this were the case, though my tr. doesn’t reflect it either, mostly because “bovine oxen” doesn’t work well in English -- or probably in Sanskrit.
