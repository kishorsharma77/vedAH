In this riddle vs. the referent is not explicitly named, and in fact an initially bewildering set of incompatible identifications comes pouring out: a bull, the sea, a bird, a stone. But all of them are possible aspects of the sun (for similar vocab. see IX.83.3), and esp. in the 2nd hemistich the position specified (“in the middle of heaven”) and the actions depicted point strongly to the sun -- a referent generally agreed upon by interpreters. The “womb of the age-old father” (pū́rvasya yónim pitúḥ) is a gender-bending, though understated, paradox. It is likely that the sun’s age-old father is Heaven (Dyaus Pitā) -- on the parental relationship of Heaven and Earth to Sūrya, see esp. I.160 -- in which case the womb is probably (lower-case) heaven, the place through which the sun travels. In the next pāda he is unambiguously situated there: mádhye divó níhitaḥ, so at least in this instance one of the side-riddles of the vs. is solved almost as soon as it is posed.
