As indicated in the publ. intro., the wandering Ṛbhus seem here to be compared to the poet and his ilk, tramp craftsmen in search of skilled work -- as Ge already suggests. (For more on itinerant priests and poets, esp. the Prātaritvan, see Jamison 1996: 184-89.) In pāda b ápākāḥ is universally interpreted as ‘westward’, derived from ápāñc-, contrasted with immediately following prā́ñcaḥ ‘facing eastward’. So, e.g., Ge “Als ihr … westwärts, ostwärts weiter zoget.” Although the direction words frequently co-occur, one might expect the stem formations here to be parallel, that is, using a form of ápāñc- rather than a derivative. Cf., e.g., prā́g ápāg údāk (III.53.11, VIII.4.1=VIII.65.1). Moreover, the Ṛbhus’ journey seems to be purposeful and directed, given the two prá forms (… prá … aítana … prā́ñcaḥ) and the fact that they reach a goal. I take ápāka- instead as a privative form of pā́ka- ‘callow, simple(ton)’, hence ‘not simple; clever, shrewd’; cf. ámūra- ‘not stupid, no fool’ to mūrá- ‘stupid’.

The tone of the locution máma ké cid āpáyaḥ is somewhat hard to read; it is reminiscent of V.52.12 té me ké cin ná tāyávaḥ. The effect seems to be approximative -- “some kind of X,” “more or less like X” -- and slightly slangy. The referent of the máma is the 1st ps. speaker of vs. 1, contra Re, who takes the phrase as the direct speech of (one of?) the Ṛbhus.
