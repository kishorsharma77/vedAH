In my interpretation Indra’s speech continues here, and having admitted the drawbacks to employing women in the ritual, he introduces the model of the yoked pair (that is, the married couple) drawing the chariot of sacrifice, a pair that must be more or less equally matched, but with the pole of the male somewhat higher than that of the female. (Some animals are more equal than others.) The image of the sacrifice as a chariot is of course a common one, and the word mithunā́ ‘complementary pair, sexual pair’ seems to me the tipoff that this is about the married couple. (Old is in general agreement.)
