As was noted above, this vs. contains three examples of the near-deictic imé, opening the first three pādas. The publ. tr. only fully renders the first one, as three examples of “these here” seemed too heavy. It is also worth noting that, though the imé forms might suggest the presence of the Maruts right here at the sacrifice (as was suggested above), the clauses in which they are found describe general activities of those gods, which would almost necessarily be performed away from the ritual ground.

Both Ge and Re follow the Pp. reading sáhasaḥ. Re interpr. it rather loosely as an abl., whereas Ge takes it as a gen. and as if it were the differently accented poss.

adj. *sahásaḥ (“die Gewalt des Gewaltigen”), without comment. Old suggests that the better reading is dat. sáhase and cites passages containing ā́√nam with the dat. I follow this interpr.
