Indra  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
Entirely an invitation to the sacrifice, this hymn conforms to the “journey” model,  with repeated exhortations to Indra to “drive here,” declarations that the sacrifice  has been prepared, and, especially in the final verse (6), hopes for reciprocal benefits  given by a satisfied Indra.
