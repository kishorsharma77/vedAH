In c the subject of sg. rohate ‘grows’ is apparently unexpressed. Ge supplies Indra, while supplying the songs as subject of the pl. juṣánta, which he seems to take as transitive ‘please’: “dann wächst er [n. Indra] wie Zweige nach, wenn sie [n. Lobreden] wohlgefallen,” though I have trouble interpreting his tr. But forms of juṣáte almost always mean ‘take pleasure’, not ‘give pleasure’ (see 29b for juṣánta in just this sense). To tackle the latter problem first, I take the subject of juṣánta to be the closest plural noun, namely ‘branches’. Although the notion of branches enjoying themselves seems odd, I suggest it may refer to their growth under favorable conditions, with good soil and the proper amounts of water and light.

(Modern gardening manuals often say that a plant “likes” this or that condition.) As for the subject of rohate, I take it as an imperfect pun: the form vayā́(ḥ) is, on the one hand, the nom. pl. of vayā́- ‘branch’; however, a *váya(ḥ), which would differ from the text only by accent and the length of the final vowel, could be the nom. sg. of the neut. -s-stem meaning ‘vitality’, and so I take it. Alternatively one could follow Bloomfield’s suggestion (made at the parallel passage II.5.4) that vayā́(ḥ) is the masc.

nom. sg. of an internally derived *vayás- ‘possessing vitality, vital one’ (=Indra). In fact I now prefer this solution and would change the publ. tr. accordingly, to “the vital one grows” (though in this case we might expect a 2nd sg. verb). (In II.5.4 this is unnecessary because Agni is easily and properly supplied as subject, and the tree branches work fine in the simile.)
