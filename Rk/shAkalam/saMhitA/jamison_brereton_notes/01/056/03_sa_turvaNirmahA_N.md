“Like a mountain peak, … glints with its thrusting” - the image seems to that of a pointed, snow-capped mountain, with the snow shining in the sun and the point appearing to thrust into the sky, though of course it doesn’t move.

Again Ge suggests that pāda-final śávaḥ could be for instr. śávasā, though he doesn’t so tr. - only wistfully remarks that ab could be a single sentence if śávaḥ were instr.
