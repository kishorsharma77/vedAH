The first pāda, beginning with a mā́prohibitive, lacks a verb, but something like “(get) us (involved) / (drag) us (into)” is likely. Perhaps Agastya delicately omitted it to avoid insulting Indra too explicitly.

On avayā́ḥ and the verse in general see also Scar’s extensive disc. (404-6, esp.

406).
