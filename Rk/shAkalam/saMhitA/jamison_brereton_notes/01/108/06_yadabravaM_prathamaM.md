See the publ. intro. for the place of this vs. in the structure of the hymn.

The “choosing” of pāda a reinforces the priestly roles of Agni (and Indra) in the preceding vs., since the sacrificer’s choosing of the priests is one of the first actions of the sacrifice -- particularly common is choosing Agni as Hotar.

The lexeme ví √hvā means ‘vie in invoking’, generally referring to our competition with other sacrificers in attempting to bring the gods, esp. Indra, to our sacrifice. This is precisely the sense that it has here, in my view. With W. E. Hale (Asuras 84-85), I take ásuraiḥ as referring to other human ‘lords’, in competition with us for the attention of the gods. Given the almost complete absence from the RV of the Asuras as a semi-divine group hostile to the Devas (for which see Hale passim, also Jamison [Staal Ged.]), and given the standard use of ví √hvā for competition between mortals, I cannot follow the near-universal assumption that the later Asuras are present in this passage. The competitors that the poet is thinking of may well be the brahmin and king in 7b and the various named groups in 8ab.

The phrasing of pāda c is unusual, and the interpretation depends crucially on one’s interpretation of śraddhā́. As I have discussed elsewhere (1996: 176-84), I take this resonant term to mean ‘trust’, particularly the trust between the parties involved in a hospitality relationship (of which the sacrifice is a most important and fraught subtype). Here the trust (śraddhā́m) of the 1st ps. speaker that his choosing will bear fruit and his competitive invocation will be successful comes true (satyā́m) and serves as a concretized goal of the gods’ journey that demonstrates that the trust was not misplaced. satyá- is almost a proleptic adjective here. Most of the standard tr.

approximate this interpr; Re’s is closest to mine.

The hí in the refrain fragment ā́hí yātám (through vs. 12) is difficult to account for under its usual functional headings. I have tentatively taken it as emphatic (a cop-out, I realize) and tr. it as “yes!” I am not convinced by Hettrich’s treatment (Hypotaxe 376, 379-80) ascribing its use to a conditional structure.
