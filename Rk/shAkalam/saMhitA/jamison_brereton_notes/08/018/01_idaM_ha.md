Ge (see also Gr s.v. sávīman-) construes ādityā́nām with sávīmani, but this seems unlikely. sávīman- is otherwise only found with its etymological partner Savitar, who does indeed appear in the last verse of this tṛca (3a). It is hard to believe that any other divinities could lay claim to this word.
