Ge supplies a verb (“we call”) in ab; WG take ā́cyāvayāmaḥ in d as the verb of both hemistichs, not just the 2nd. My interpr. is similar to WG’s, but with a further twist. I take vājáyantaḥ in b as a pun. The sense ‘seeking prizes’ is supported by parallel gavyántaḥ … aśvāyántaḥ … / janīyántaḥ “seeking cows, seeking horses, seeking wives,” even though the denom. ‘seeking prizes’ is ordinarily accented on the denom. suffix as vājayá-. By contrast vājáya- is usually transitive in the meaning ‘incite, rouse’, and it can be so here, with índram as object.
