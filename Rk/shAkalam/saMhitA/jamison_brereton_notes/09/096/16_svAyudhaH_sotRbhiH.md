The bahuvrīhi sv-āyudhá- ‘having good weapons’ echoes the odd command that ends the previous hymn in this structure, 12d janáyā́yudhāni “beget weapons!” This echo may have contributed to the attachment of 13-16 at that point in the text.

Soma’s goal in b, “the dear hidden name” (gúhyaṃ cā́ru nā́ma), has a surprisingly large number of possible referents. Lü (526) suggests the sun, Ge (n.

16b) amṛ́ta- the drink of immortality. I would add Soma’s own name (see IX.92.2, 4 and comm. thereon), or the cows on the basis of IX.87.3 apīcyàm gúhyaṃ nā́ma gónām, or the gods, as in the immed. preceding hymn IX.95.2 devā́nāṃ gúhyāni nā́ma, or Indra on the basis of IX.109.14 bíbharti cā́rv índrasya nā́ma.
