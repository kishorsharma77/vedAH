Soma Pavamāna
Bhrgu V ̥ āruṇi or Jamadagni Bhārgava
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
Even in this maṇḍala devoted to “self-purifying” Soma, the constant repetition of  that epithet and its associated verbal forms (“purify yourself,” etc.) in this hymn is  remarkable. In particular, the idiom “by purifying yourself bring here ...” (much  more economically expressed in Sanskrit by ā́ pavasva) is insistent, along with other  demands that Soma bring or convey goods here. Intermingled are verses treating the familiar details of soma preparation. All in all, the hymn seems flat, uninspired,  and repetitive.
The tr̥ca consisting of verses 22–24 breaks the monotony to some degree, with  the first two verses listing various places where the soma may be pressed (the  meaning of some of these words is disputed and their translation provisional),  and only the third returning to the dominant theme of the hymn. The final tr̥ca  (vss. 28–30) brings the hymn to a close with a flurry of repetitions of the preverb  ā́ “here, hither,” in a list of items we wish to bring to hand as a result of the soma  offering.
