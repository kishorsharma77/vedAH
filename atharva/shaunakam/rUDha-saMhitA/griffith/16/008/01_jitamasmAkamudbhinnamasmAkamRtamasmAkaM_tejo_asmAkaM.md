Whatever we have gained, whatever hath accrued to us, our Right, our energy, our Devotion, our heavenly light, our sacrifice, our domestic animals, our offspring, our men,--from all share herein we exclude Such-an-one, descendant of Such- an-one, son of Such-a-woman. Let him not be freed from the noose of Grahi. Here I bind up his splendour, his energy, his vital breath, his life, and cast him down beneath me.
