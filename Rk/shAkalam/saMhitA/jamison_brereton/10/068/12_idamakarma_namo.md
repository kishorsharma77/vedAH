This act of reverence here we have performed for the one belonging to  the storm cloud, who keeps bellowing after the many (cows?):
Br̥haspati—for he shall confer vigor on us with cows, with horses, with  heroes, with superior men.
Sumitra Vādhryaśva is said to be the composer of the next two hymns (69–70), one  to Agni, one an Āprī hymn.
