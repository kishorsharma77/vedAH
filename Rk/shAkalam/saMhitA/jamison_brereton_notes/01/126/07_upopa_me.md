This is presumably the speech of the woman whose charms were described in vs. 6. I have tr. it with what I consider appropriate vulgarity.

In pāda a úpopa ‘nearer’ and párā ‘away’ might seem to be preverbs that would cancel each other out, but here their conjunction perhaps invites the interpr.

that she's asking for ever more intimate contact (úpopa) with parts that are usually off limits (párā).

Ge (/WG) take dabhrā́ṇi manyathāḥ to mean “think that (my hair) is meager” vel sim., with the hair borrowed from the second hemistich. I think rather that dabhrá- √man means ‘belittle, think little of’, but that dabhrā́ṇi should also be read as the object of that compound verb. This latter dabhrā́ṇi I take as a euphemism for her private parts (‘little things’), in the way that priyā́‘dear things’ is used by Indrāṇī in X.86.5 to refer to the same. (The contexts -- explicit female boasting about sex -- are similar, not to mention rare.) I thus take dabhrā́ṇi twice.

Although it is clear why a ewe, even a little ewe (avikā́), would be a fine example of a hairy female, I have no idea why Gandharī ewes would be especially hairy. Cold climate, one assumes.
