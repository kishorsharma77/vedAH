The somewhat awkward tripling of yád in 49.7 is avoided here with a simple yád … yád vā, but the two versions still echo each other exactly: yád dha nūnám … (a) / yád vā prthivy ̥ ā́m … (b), as also in c mahemata. The d pādas are identically structured, but lexically distinct: nom. sg. + instr. pl. (to same stem) ā́ gahi.
