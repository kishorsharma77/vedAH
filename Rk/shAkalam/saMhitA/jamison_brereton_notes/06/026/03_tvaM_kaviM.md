As discussed ad VI.20.4, the three occurrences of arká-sāti- ‘the winning of the sun’s rays’ (I.174.7, VI.20.4, and here) are all found in conjunction with a poet (kaví-) and in connection with the Kutsa / Śuṣṇa myth. These associations point fairly decisively to Uśanā Kāvya as the poet in question.

Pāda b contains one of the few occurrences of √vṛj ‘twist, wring’ without preverb; another is found nearby at VI.18.8. Hoffmann (183) reads injunc. párā han for Pp. párā ahan. Given the preponderance of injunctives in these vss. and esp. han at the end of 5c, this seems likely. (See also sácāhan in the next vs. and 6d.)
