Against most tr., I take pāda a as an independent nominal clause and construe b with c. The locc. in b refer to the chariot and its box, onto which the Maruts are mounting. The same phrase two hymns later, VIII.22.9 ā́hí ruhátam …, ráthe kóśe hiraṇyáye, with a verb of mounting, seems to clinch this interpr., though Ge (n. 8b) explicitly claims that the two nearby phrases, in hymns by the same poet, are used differently.

I think gó-bandhu- ‘having a cow/cows as kin’ is a pun, an interpr. not registered in the publ. tr. On the one hand it refers to the Maruts’ mother Pṛśni; on the other, on the basis of vā́ja-bandhu- ‘having prizes as kin’ (VIII.68.19) and the word play in the adjacent hymn, VIII.21.4 (see comm. there), it is also a clever way to say that the Maruts have cows at their disposal to give to us. These are the same cows with which the music is anointed in pāda a.

I do not see any way around supplying a verb of motion or mounting in bcd: the Maruts mount their chariot or come in order for us to enjoy the nourishment they bring (cf. 2c iṣā́nah … ā́gatā “come here to us with nourishment”) and to gain other desirable things, in two parallel infinitive phrases (iṣé bhujé … na spárase).

The root noun íṣ- is tr. two different ways in 2c (‘refreshment’) and 8c (‘nourishment’). These should have been harmonized.
