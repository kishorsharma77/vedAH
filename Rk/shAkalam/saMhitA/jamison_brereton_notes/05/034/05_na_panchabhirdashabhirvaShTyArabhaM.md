The usual arrangement beween Indra and mortals is re-established in this vs., where Indra’s punishment comes only to the stingy and the non-worshipper, and the pious man gets rewarded.

There is a difference of opinion about the sense of pāda a, because of different interpr. of the acc. inf. ārábham and of the numerical expressions. Ge takes ārábham as ‘sich verbinden’ and the expressions of numbers as referring to people or gods -- the sense being that Indra doesn’t want to team up with others because he’s strong enough on his own. But ā́√rabh does not have that meaning, but only ‘to grasp, grab hold of’. WG also take the numbers as personal: “Nicht wünscht er mit fünf, mit zehn (Leuten) das Erraffen (von Beute),” which I confess I don’t understand. Is the intent that he wants to pile up his booty all by himself? By contrast, I take the numbers as referring to the means of grasping the offerings/goods -- either by the number of gifts (=in increments of five or ten) or by handfuls: one (=five fingers) or two (=ten fingers) -- and he doesn’t want to acquire the goods in such trifling installments.

In c the question is the function of amuyā́. I cannot identify a part of the WG tr. that represents amuyā́. Ge’s interpr. is minimalistic: íd amuyā́“nur so,” which Klein (II.160) helpfully expands to “only in that circumstance (viz. when a wealthy person does not have soma pressed for him).” This may well be right. However, I compare X.135.2 cárantam pāpáyāmuyā́“going along yonder evil way.” In our passage this may refer to highway robbery: the offending non-presser gets robbed as he makes his way along the road. Or it may be metaphorical: if the non-presser continues to pursue this behavior he’ll be punished.
