Although this verse belongs to a different tṛca, it seems to provide an alternative resolution to the puzzle of vs. 2, somewhat different from that given in 3ab. Here Indra is definitively identified as a gópati- ‘lord of cows’, paraphrasing 2cd pátim … ághnyānāṃ dhenūnā́m.

Ge takes yáthā vidé as “wie er bekannt ist,” but this tag phrase regularly refers to the traditional way of producing poetry or performing ritual. See, e.g., I.132.2, VIII.13.14, IX.86.32.

satyásya sátpatim is probably a pseudo-pun, given that by many accounts (including ours) sát-pati- derives from sáts-pati-, with the first member a reduction of sádas- ‘seat, settlement’. See EWA s.v. If sát- belongs to √as (as some think), it is a real pun.
