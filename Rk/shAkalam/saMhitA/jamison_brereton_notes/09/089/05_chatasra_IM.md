The cátasraḥ … ghṛtadúhaḥ … níṣattāḥ “four (fem.), yielding ghee as milk, set down …” is highly reminiscent of IX.74.6 cátasro nā́bho níhitāḥ “four hidden (lit., ‘put down, deposited’) (streams) bursting out …” See comm. ad loc., where, flg.

Ge, I suggest that “four” is a metaphorical reference to the four teats of a cow’s udder. In our passage I don’t understand what “set down within the same support” (samāné antár dharúṇe) refers to, unless it’s the placement of the teats in/on the udder, which would be the dharúṇa- here. I also don’t know if there’s a secondary reference to some piece or pieces of ritual equipment from which (pitcher with 4 spouts? 4 pitchers?) the mixing milk is poured, or if an actual cow is stationed nearby. But here, as in IX.74.6, I think the immediate physical referent is to the streams of milk that emerge from the teats, rather than their source(s).

The īm in c was omitted from the tr., where it presumably expresses the goal of arṣanti. I would now tr. “They rush to him while being purified …” The parens.

around “him” in the next pāda can be erased, since that pāda also contains īm. The concentration of forms of īm in this hymn should also be noted: 2d (2x), 4c, 5a, 5c, 5d.
