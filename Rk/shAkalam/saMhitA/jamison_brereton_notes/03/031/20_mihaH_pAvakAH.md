The mists are probably in part metaphorical -- menacing threats and mental darkness -- but may also refer physically to morning mists, which are clearing as the dawn sacrifice begins. Note also that pāda-initial míhaḥ is a mirror image of máhi, which opens so many pādas in this hymn (see comm. ad 12b).
