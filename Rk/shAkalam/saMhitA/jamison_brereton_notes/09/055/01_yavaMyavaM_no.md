As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. is unusual in its reference to agriculture (see Ober. RdR II.118), in particular to ‘grain, barley’ (yáva-) in pāda a. Perhaps the fact that soma is a plant, and that its stalk (ándhas-) is prominent in this hymn, accounts for the implication that Soma has the ability to provide us with grain and its accompanying fruitfulness (puṣṭá-). It may also be an oblique ref. to the occasional mixing of soma with grain; see the enigmatic expression in IX.68.4.
