The first hemistich of this vs. presents us with a common problem: the most obvious way to interpr. it meets a syntactic stumbling block that should not allow that interpr., and the standard interpr. ignore that obstruction. In this case the issue is the middle participle gṛṇānáḥ. This part. is attested over 50x; the vast majority of these attestations are clearly passive in value. In fact, Gr interpr. only 2 forms as “medial” (that is, transitive, not passive): this passage and I.181.9.

Nonetheless, both Ge and Re take it as transitive here (though with different objects) without comment. But I think we ignore the use of the overwhelming majority of forms at our peril. In fact, since Agni as Hotar is the implicit subject of the sentence, a passive value of gṛṇānáḥ is easily possible: as both Hotar and god, Agni performs a ritual invocation (as priest) while himself being hymned (as god). (The other 86 occurrence flagged by Gr as non-passive, I.181.9, is indeed transitive, but owes its anomalous usage to special circumstances. See comm. ad loc.) If we eliminate gṛṇānáḥ as a potential governor of an object, the acc. satrā́cīṃ rātím must be construed with ā́… johavīti. Although the acc. with (ā́) √hvā is more usually a god or other animate being, abstract entities (like ‘giving’ here) are also possible. The vaḥ in 2nd position in pāda a, which might have served as acc. to ā́… johavīti must then be a gen. dependent on the acc. NP. The more usual configuration is restored in pāda d havate vaḥ “he calls upon you,” a minor ex. of poetic repair.

In c both Ge and Re supply ‘sacrificer’ with gen. ī́vataḥ ‘such’, while I supply ‘wealth’. There is in fact no good support for either position that I can find. I prefer mine because ‘wealth’ would pick up ‘giving’ from the previous pāda, whereas there is no mention of a sacrificer anywhere. But I do not strongly favor my solution.

gopā́- ‘herdsman’ is regularly construed with ṛtásya ‘truth’ (e.g., I.163.5, III.10.2), so perhaps that phrase is meant, anticipating ádvayāvī ‘without duplicity’ in d. Note that the gopā́- is also ádabdha-/ ádabhya- ‘undeceivable’ (e.g., II.9.6, X.25.7).
