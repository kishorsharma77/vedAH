The hapax ahanā́is difficult. Gr connects it with (áhar /) áhan- ‘day’. Ge tr.

‘unverwüstliche’ (indestructible); he does not comment, but judging from the tr. I assume he takes it from a negated derivative of √han ‘smite’. Old tentatively suggests a connection with √ah ‘say’, though he doesn’t gloss the result (for perhaps obvious reasons). Re ‘lascive’ with caution, connecting it possibly with āhanás- ‘swollen, lusty’ (usually of soma). WG refuse to tr. but suggest in the n. an adverbial derivation of the particle áha ‘certainly’. My tr. rests on the possibility that it represents *máhanā, with the initial m lost after the final m of the preceding word: gṛháṃ-gṛham ahanā́… This would make for better meter; otherwise there are four consecutive light syllables, spanning the (early) caesura, and Arnold (194) deems × - ⏑ ⏑ an “occasional” (that is, relatively rare) pattern of the trimeter opening. But what would such *mahanā́represent? I suggest that it should be grouped with the trisyllabic form mah·nā́(IV.2.1, X.6.7 [possibly; see comm. ad loc.]); this appears to be a variant of mahinā́, the longer version of the instr. sg. to mahimán-, whose shorter version is the very common disyllabic mahnā́. The medial -a- here would result from matching the second vowel of mahánt-, mahá-, mahás-/máhas-, as well as the combining form mahā-. Or it might actually reflect a different syllabification of the inherited instr. *maǵH-mn-aH as * maǵH-m̥n-aH, with the suffixal m vocalized between two consonants, rather than the preceding laryngeal.
