Both Ge and Re take vīhí as having a double acc., with svastíṃ sukṣitím the secondary object expressing benefits we seek from the gods whom we pursue (e.g., Ge “Ersuche die Männer des Himmels um Glück, um gutes Wohnen.” But this seems unnecessary (and is not the usual syntax of √vī); the root √vī takes a variety of objects, including concrete inanimates, as in VI.12.6 (in this cycle) véṣi rāyáḥ “you pursue riches,” and here I see it as having both inanimate and animate objects.
