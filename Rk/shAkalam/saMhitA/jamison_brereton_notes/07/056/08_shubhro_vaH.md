The nominal equations of 7ab continue in the first half of this vs., and śubhráḥ picks up śubhā́śóbhiṣṭhāḥ of 6b. Although śúṣmaḥ is not etymologically related to śubhráḥ, they are alliterative.

Pāda c contains a rhyming simile: dhúnir múnir. Such full rhyme is quite rare in the RV and seems to provide the crescendo of this highly wrought little passage.

Note also that the final of d, dhṛṣṇóḥ, is a slight flip of the initial of c, dhúniḥ. 82 In order to get a proper Dvipadā Virāj line, the iva of c has to be read ‘va, as it sometimes is elsewhere. See Old. If the particle is disyllabic, however, it makes cd a Triṣṭubh pāda. Since the Dvipadā Virāj section of the hymn is drawing to a close (fully Triṣtubh starting with vs. 12), the possible double metrical reading here may be gesturing towards the upcoming Triṣṭubh takeover. Indeed the Dvipadā Virāj begins to break up beginning in vs. 10, despite the Anukr. identification of 1-11 as DV.

In the simile of c, iva (/va) is out of place; we expect *dhúnir iva múniḥ. This displacement was doubtless made to draw attention to the rhyme noted above. But it also interacts somewhat with the question of whether cd contains two DV pādas or one Triṣṭubh, because a quick glance at Lub shows that iva is fairly rare immediately after the caesura, which would be its position here if we are dealing with a Triṣṭubh pāda. I imagine that this rarity has less to do with iva’s accentless status (though that might contribute) than with its usual tendency to take 2nd position, which would generally put it earlier in the line. There certainly do exist trimeter lines with iva post-caesura, e.g., IV.18.6 ṛtāvarīr iva saṃkróṣamānāḥ (cf. also V.1.1, 11.5, etc.); they are just less common than I had expected.
