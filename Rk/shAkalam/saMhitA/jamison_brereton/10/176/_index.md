Agni [or, according to the Anukramaṇı, R̄ ̥bhus (1),  Agni (2–4)]
Sūnu Ārbhava
4 verses: anuṣṭubh, except gāyatrī 2
A simple hymn treating the ritual fire on its first appearance. The only real difficulty  is found in verse 4. Although the precise meaning of the first hemistich is disputed,  it seems to these readers that this verse almost paradoxically frees Agni from his  birth as a god in order to situate him firmly in the mortal sphere, where human life  takes place: the theme of Agni’s “dual citizenship” is a common one in the R̥gveda.
