The first hemistich lacks a verb, but something like ‘we seek’ is a reasonable bet, to govern áskṛdhoyu ‘not stunted’, which elsewhere modifies ‘wealth’ (VI.22.3) and ‘treasure-conferral’ (VII.53.3), hence my ‘giving’.

Ge produces an elaborate interpr. of cd as a portrayal of battle: ‘cows’ = bow string, ‘straight-flying one’ = arrow. Although such tropes would be at home in other parts of the RV, I see no martial context in this hymn that would encourage such a reading. Better to interpr. the hemistich within a ritual context, since this has been prominent in the hymn. The cows can, as so often, be the milk meant to be mixed with the soma; the ‘straight-flying one’ (ṛjipyá-, on which see comm. ad IV.27.4) can be the soma, or, as in IV.27.4, the falcon that carried the soma, and the bull in d is also the soma. Re follows Ge’s battle interpr., though (in his comm.) he also sees it overlaid with soma imagery.
