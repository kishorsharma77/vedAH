prá prajā́bhir jāyate is a nice figure in which prá doubles the first part of the cmpd. and jāyate the second.

dhármaṇas pári receives quite varied interpr. I take it as a spatial metaphor: the fortunate pious man is propagated through his progeny “from his foundation,” that is, starting from himself and spreading out by children and grandchildren (etc.).
