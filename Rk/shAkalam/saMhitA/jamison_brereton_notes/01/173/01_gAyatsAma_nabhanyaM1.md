IH suggests tr. gā́yat and árcāma as Engl. progressives: “he is singing .. we are chanting.” He points out that the (implied) presential nature of the nominal cl. of c and the future-referring final clause that depends on it in d support this interpr.

The standard tr. take véḥ as a nom. sg. In Ge’s tr., however, the bird seems to be compared to the sāman, not the singer: “Er stimme den Gesang an, der hervorschiesst wie ein Vogel.” So also Re, it seems. Hoffmann (/WG) make the more natural (and grammatically correct) comparison with the singer. Although it requires some extra machinery, I prefer to take véḥ as gen. sg. I think Ge is on the right track, that the comparison is not the rather banal one between singer and bird, but the quality of “bursting forth” (nabhanyàm) characteristic of bird song, a natural effusion.

If this is the comparison meant, then only a gen. will work, dependent either on sā́ma read a second time or on a different word for (bird) song to be supplied.

The obj. of árcāma must be neut., which unfortunately excludes the cognate arká- (m.). Any neut. word for verbal product will do (vácas-, bráhman-, etc.).

The pf. part. vāvṛdhānám would be better tr. “that has grown strong.” I would thus now tr. ab as “He is singing the sāman that is bursting out like (the song of) a bird; we are chant this (chant) that has grown strong …” The syntax of cd is ambiguous; c can be an independent nominal cl., with d dependent on it (so Ge, Re, and me) or the two can be read together as a single subordinate cl. (so Hoffmann [/WG]), with the subordinating conjunction yád postponed until pāda d. This is not impossible, since pāda c is a single NP, but it seems a bit awkward. I prefer the two-clause solution.
