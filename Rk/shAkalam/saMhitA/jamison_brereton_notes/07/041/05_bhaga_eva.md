The punning continues here with a clever twist: even Bhaga himself should become possessed of a portion (bhágavant-) (a); (only) in this way (téna) will we become bhágavant- (b). In other words, Bhaga needs to get his own portion before he can pass it on to us.

This vs. forms a slight ring with vs. 1: the intensive verb johavīti provides one additional stem to the two forms of √hū in vs. 1, havāmahe and huvema.
