In pāda a the Pp reads śriyé for the Saṃhitā śriyá ā́. Ge concurs, but Re tr.

“… est issu de la gloire,” with an apparent ablative - which is how I interpr. the form. The lexeme nír √i ‘come out, come forth’ generally takes an abl., and the gesture towards a versified paradigm (śriyé … śriyás [a], śríyam [b]) speak in favor of the abl.

The pl. subj. of c may be the singers, the only plural entitiy overt in the vs. so far. So Sāy. and by implication (see his n. 4c) Ge. However, I think that Re is correct is supplying instead “les sucs-de-soma,” since vasāná-, common in IX, is applied only to soma. The interchange between sg. and pl. in reference to soma and its streams/drops, etc., is of course ubiquitous in this maṇḍala.

The final pāda is quite unclear and its interpr. depends in part on identity of the ref. of the loc. mitádrau ‘of measured pace’. Ge and Re both take it to be Soma.

Acdg, to Ge, the loc. is to be construed with samithā́(“Die Kämpfe um ihn, der einen festen Schritt hat …”), but as far as I am aware, samithá- is not found with a loc. elsewhere. Re makes this loc. into a loc. absolute, by virtue of supplying a near paragraph of extraneous matter, which has a whiff of desperation in it. My interpr.

begins with the fact that of the 5 occurences of the stem mitádru- the two other singular ones both refer to Agni (IV.6.5, VII.7.1). I therefore suggest that he is also the referent here. The “encounters” (samithā́) that are to be realized (bhávanti satyā́) take place at the ritual fire; the loc. is simply recalling us firmly to the ritual ground.

The encounters in question I take to be the encounter of the soma streams/drops (etc.) with the gods who are to consume them - or possibly the encounters with the water and milk mixtures.
