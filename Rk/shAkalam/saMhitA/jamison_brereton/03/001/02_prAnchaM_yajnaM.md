[The priests:] “We have made the sacrifice turned to the east (in order to  begin). Let our song become strong.” (So saying) they befriend Agni  with kindling wood and with reverence.
From heaven they [=the gods?] have directed the ritual distributions of  the sages. They have sought the way for (Agni), even for the clever and  mighty one.
