This verse paraphrases and expands vs. 2. The nominal expression in 2b ási bhū́ri parādadíḥ is turned into the verb parādádāti in 6b; śikṣasi in 2d is echoed by śikṣatu in 6c; the phrase bhū́ri te vásu is repeated verbatim (2e, 6d); and the dative beneficiaries in 2 (yájamānāya 2d, suvaté 2e) are replaced by dāśúṣe (6b) and, more tellingly, asmábhyam (6c). The source of the wealth that Indra distributes is also made clear: it belonged to the stranger and is presumably plunder.
