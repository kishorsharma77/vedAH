Apnavāna appears with the Bhṛgus also in VIII.102.4, but nothing more is known of him (cf. Mayr., Personenname s.v.). Scar (366-67), though without disc., renders it not as a sg. PN, but as a nom. pl. adj. modifying the Bhṛgus (“die reichen (?) Bhṛgus”), presumably to a stem *ápnavan-, roughly parallel to ápnasvant-.

However, the usage in VIII.102.4 makes it clear that at least in that passage it is a PN. In c virurucúḥ gives a bad cadence, and by meaning it could easily belong to the redupl. aor. arūruca-. The same pāda-final sequence (save for accent) … bhṛ́gavo ví rurucuḥ is also found at X.122.5. It is therefore tempting (see Old [Noten], Arnold [Ved. Metre 128] for the temptation) to lengthen the reduplicating vowel. However, the undeniable 3rd pl. pf. ending (aor. should be *rūrucan) and the existence of other transitive exx. of rurucuḥ in other metrical positions (see Kü 431) temper the temptation. Still, I’d be inclined to read *virūrucuḥ and assume that the stem has been secondarily incorporated into the pf. For further disc. see comm. ad IV.16.4.
