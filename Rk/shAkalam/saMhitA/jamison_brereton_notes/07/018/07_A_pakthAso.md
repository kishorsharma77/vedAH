Ge (fld. by Gotō, 1st Kl., 222) takes bhananta as reflexive (“… nannten sich”) with śivā́saḥ as pred. nom., but the responsive pairing of act. 3rd pl. pres.

bhananti and mid. 3rd pl. injunc. bhananta in adjacent vss. in the same metrical position in IV.18.6-7 (see comm. ad loc.) marks bhananta as a text-book case of - anta replacement, as disc. in my 1979 article. Flg. Schmidt, I take cd as the direct speech implied by bhananta. Old also rejects the Ge interpr.

The l’s of the names bhalānás- and álina- and the unmotivated retroflex -ṣ- in viṣāṇín- suggest peoples outside of the Ārya mainstream, although of course they could also show the kinds of deliberate phonological deformation found elsewhere in the hymn. It’s possible that bhalānás- reflects a form of √bhṛ, hence my ‘raiders’. It is not clear whether śivā́saḥ should be interpr. as the usual adj. (‘kindly’) or as the name of another group of fighters. The publ. tr. reflects the former (flg. Schmidt), but I am now inclined to consider the latter more likely, primarily because it’s not phonologically outlandish. In this case I’d tr. “The Pakthas and the Bhalānases spoke out, and the Alinas and the Viṣānins -- (all) ‘kindly’ --” This would be a sarcastic aside about the martial forces ranged against us.

If we accept the Schmidt/Witzel distribution of the allegiances of the various named forces, those named in ab are complaining about the defection of the sadhamā́d- who led them to the battle but has now gone over to the Tṛtsu (/Sudās) side and has turned to attack the nṝ̥́n (‘superior men’), by which they mean themselves. The sadhamā́d- is most likely Indra, and so losing him as an ally would be a serious blow.

On the unexpected form sadhamā́s, if the nom. sg. to sadhamā́d-, see Scar (381) with lit. I think it unlikely that it’s an acc. pl., a possibility Old considers by assigning it to a diff. root. As noted above (vs. 6) with regard to puroḷā́s, the rhyme with king Sudās may have played a part.

Ge’s interpr. of the syntax of cd is impossible: it contains an embedded main clause! His rel. cl. consists of ā́yó ‘nayat … yudhā́nṛ́̄n “… der seine Mannen unter Kampf heranführte” -- the beginning of c and the end of d. While his main clause is the end of c and the beginning of d, … sadhamā́ā́ryasya, gavyā́tṛ́tsubhyo ajagan … “Der Mahlgenossen des Ariers … ist aus Verlangen nach Kühen den Tr̥tsu's (zu Hilfe) gekommen.” My tr. follows Old’s, which is slightly adjusted by Schmidt.
