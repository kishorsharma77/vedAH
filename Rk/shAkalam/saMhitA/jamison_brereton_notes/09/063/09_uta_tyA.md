Pāda b of this vs., sū́ro ayukta yā́tave, consists entirely of words repeated from the previous vs.; in addition, substituting for étaśam in 8a, we find an expanded horse term, tyā́ haríto dáśa “these ten tawny mares” as obj. of ayukta. Again Soma is being identified with the sun and his ritual journey identified with the sun’s transit; again the cosmic and the ritual are intertwined, for the ten mares are probably both the Sun’s horses (as Lü points out, p.

216 n. 4, the Sun is credited with ten yoked horses in I.164.14; cf. also sū́ryasya harítaḥ in V.29.5) and the ten fingers of the priests that press the soma, exactly so called (haríto dáśa) in IX.38.3.

The third pāda (índur índra íti bruván) presents another set of problems: how much of what precedes íti is part of the direct speech and what is the content of the speech? See Old’s clear formulation of these questions. The standard solution is to take the speech as including both words preceding íti and to take it as a statement of identity; e.g., Ge’s “Der Saft ist Indra” (sim. Old, Lü 216 n. 4, Klein DGRV I.407), in part on the basis of a similar TB statement (see Ge n. 9c), though I don’t think this late parallel should be given much weight. Moreover, IX.6.2 índav índra íti …, with voc. índo outside of the quotation, shows that the ‘drop’ word does not have to be included in the quotation here. In addition, the sandhi of índra íti is ambig.: it can represent nom. índraḥ with the Pp (and the standard interpr.), but it could also be loc. índre, the choice made by Re (“… en disant « c’est bien (pour aller) à Indra »”). In conjunction with the journey theme of this tṛca, I find this interpr.

quite appealing and have adopted it.
