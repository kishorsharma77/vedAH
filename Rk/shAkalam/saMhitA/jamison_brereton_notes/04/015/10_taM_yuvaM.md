In one way this vs. is simply a more active variant of vs. 9. In 9 it is implied that Sāhadevya will be long-lived because of the Aśvins (somehow or other); in 10 they are ordered to make him so. But there’s a grammatical twist at the end: the impv. kṛṇotana is plural not dual, and so the Aśvins may have helper(s). The shift to the pl. is probably yet another example of the tendency to open out to the larger divine world in final vss., by including unspecified others -- so here “you (two and other gods).” But it’s worth pointing out that no du. impv. of √kṛ would fit this metrical slot. (On the other hand, no RVic poet with even middling skills would have been unable to throw in a particle or the like to make the meter work.)
