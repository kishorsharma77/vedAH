Gotō (1st class, 173-74) posits a separate root √di ‘destroy’ to account for 5 occurrences of dáyate ordinarily taken to mean ‘divide’ with the other occurrences of dáyate. (The forms in question are found in III.34.1, IV.7.10, VI.6.5, 22.9, and X.80.2.) He is followed by Lub and (at least in this passage and IV.7.10) WG. I see no reason to split the present into two and posit a second root; ví dayate ‘divide into pieces, fragment’ is simply another of the vivid images of destruction that RVic poets gloried in.
