The 3rd ps. ref. of the nom. du. in vs. 11 is transformed into 2nd ps. ref. by the 2nd du. impv. hatam in 12b, mediated by the dual prn. tāú, which in this context, with a flg. impv., can have either 3rd or 2nd ps. ref. (see my “sá figé”).

Ge and Re take ābhogá- and udadhí- as PNs, which seems odd since both words are easily interpretable. The latter is in fact attested in other passages as a common noun meaning ‘water-holder, reservoir’ and its components are clear. I assume that the reason for assuming a PN is that a ‘water-holder’ is considered to be 119 a positive entity, and since it is to be smashed, it must be negatively viewed here. But “holding” water can shade into “withholding” water, a negative action. We might here also invoke the first vs., where the hymn is produced “like rain from a cloud.” A cloud can be considered a ‘water-holder’, and the positive and negative aspects of water-holding may be contrasted in the 1st and last vss.. As indicated above, although I do think the tṛcas in this hymn were originally independent, some sense of ring composition might have gone into their combining.

As for ābhogá, Old seriously doubts the gloss ‘snake’ found, e.g., in Gr. But I’m somewhat puzzled as to why. There is certainly a root √bhuj ‘bend, coil’ distinct from √bhuj ‘enjoy, benefit’, and bhogá- definitely means ‘(snake’s) coil’ in reference to Vṛtra in V.29.6 ... bhogā́n sākáṃ vájreṇa maghávā vivṛścát “the bounteous one hews apart his [=Vr̥tra's] … coils at one blow with his mace.”
