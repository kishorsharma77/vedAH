Ge suggests that the waters are “accompanied by the Maruts” (marútvatīḥ) because the waters here are storm-rains. Although in a Marut context this would seem reasonable, in this Vṛtra-smashing context the waters should not be rain but the rivers confined by Vṛtra, and this interpretation is in fact possible here. Note that Sarasvatī, the river par excellence, is called both marútvatī (II.30.8) and marútsakhā (VII.96.2); this association must be a mediated one: the river is accompanied by or the companion of the Maruts because their storm-rains swell the rivers.
