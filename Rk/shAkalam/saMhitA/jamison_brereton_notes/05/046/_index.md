All Gods On my hypothesis concerning the reason for this hymn, viz., support for the ritual innovation of the PatnÄ«, see publ. intro. Save for the final two vss. devoted to the wives of the gods, there seems no rationale for the deities included or excluded from the enumerative vss. or for the repetition of some and not others.
