On the semantic connection between the first and second hemistichs, see publ. intro. Particularly note the simple etymological figure in cd #ví … #ávocanta … vívācaḥ# in the half-vs. concerning the disunity of the various peoples; here the etymological sense of carṣaṇí- as ‘bordered, separate (people)’ also gets fully used.

In contrast to the ví-s of cd, we might have expected the presence of sám in ab to express the unity found there, since this is the standard contrastive pairing. But the theme of unity is expressed in ab by ékaḥ and hástayoḥ: Indra alone takes them all into his two hands.

The phrase rayipate rayīṇā́m is clearly of the familiar “X-lord of X-es” type, though it has some twists. On the one hand, though rayipate is a voc. and lacks accent, rayī́ṇā́m has its usual accent even though oblique case forms in voc. phrases regularly lose their accents. On the other, the nom. ékaḥ should be construed with the voc. rayipate, not independently (that is, the pāda doesn’t mean “You have become the one, o wealth-lord of wealth”). Ge takes the phrase as a predicative voc. The publ.

tr. represents the construction as a haplology, because the predicative voc. is next to impossible to render into English -- or German: Hoffmann’s (Injunk. 218) “du (Indra) bist es allein geworden, o Reichtumsherr der Reichtümer” is cautionary in that regard. Ge’s cited parallel IV.17.6cd satā́bhavo vásupatir vásūnām, dátre víśvā adhithā indra krṣṭ̥ ī́ḥ, which closely resembles the hemistich here, reinforces the constituency of our rayipate rayīṇā́m.

In c the standard formula toká- tánaya- ‘progeny (and) posterity’ is interspersed with other locatives of the stakes, in the sequence toké apsú tánaye ca sūré; I take the ca here as connecting the formulaic pair and have tr. them together, with the others postponed. Cf. VI.25.4, 66.8.
