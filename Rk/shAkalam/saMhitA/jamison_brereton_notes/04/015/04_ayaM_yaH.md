Ge’s tr. “vor Sṛñjaya Daivavāta” assumes that puráḥ can act as a preposition with a locative. Since there is no other evidence for this, and since the puráḥ is better taken as a reference to Agni’s location on the ritual ground, as regularly seen in the epithet puróhita- ‘placed in front’, I take the loc. of the PN as an unmarked loc. abs.

(“SD [being there]”) or with Re and WG as a simple locational, which is far easier to convey with French chez or German bei than in English.
