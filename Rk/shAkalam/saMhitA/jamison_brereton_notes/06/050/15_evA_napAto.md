On the phrase máma tásya as a probable play on the PN Mamatā̆, see comm. ad VI.10.2.

The phrase vásavo ádhṛṣṭāḥ returns from 4b, where it refers to the Maruts (unless, with Ge and Re we take vásavaḥ there, and here, as referring to a separate group, the Vasus). There it was immediately preceded by hūtā́saḥ ‘invoked’, here by hutā́saḥ ‘offered to’, an understated but clever variation. In this context, the final totalizing vs. of the hymn, the “unassailable good ones” should probably refer to all the gods, in a gender-inclusive pairing with the gnā́ḥ ‘(divine) ladies’ -- an unusual bow to the female side.
