Indra
Jaya Aindri
3 verses: triṣṭubh
Indra’s victories over his (and our) enemies are the special focus of this hymn, but  the poet does not fail to mention our interest in his gifts as well (vs. 1).
## 1
O much-summoned one, you have vanquished your rivals. Your
tempestuous power is preeminent. Now let your giving be here:
Indra, bring good things here along with the priestly gift. You are the  master of rich rivers.
## 2
Like a fearsome wild beast, living in the mountains and roaming
wherever it wants, you have come here from the farther distance.
Having honed sharp your fang and your wheel-rim, Indra, carve apart  your rivals. Shove aside the scornful.
## 3
Indra, you were born to dominion and to might worth winning, you bull  of the settled domains.
You drove away the people that are not allies. You made a wide
wide-place for the gods.
