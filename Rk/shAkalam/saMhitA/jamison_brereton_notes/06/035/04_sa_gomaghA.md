Both jaritré and gómaghā are repeated from the previous vs. (where they were not in the same clause), though the latter has changed gender: in 3c it is neut.

pl., while in 4a the same sandhi form is fem. pl. and represents underlying gómaghā(ḥ). This bahuvrīhi has spawned two parallel descriptors: áśva-ścandrā(ḥ) and vā́ja-śravasaḥ, all three modifying fem. pl. pṛ́kṣaḥ.

The tr. ‘lay on’ (that is, provide, often lavishly, often of meals or feasts) is an English idiom that precisely calques ádhi dhehi. I take íṣah … dhenúm as a double acc. with √pī ‘swell’ -- lit., ‘swell the cow the refreshments’, that is, ‘swell the cow with refreshments’. Ge hesitates (n. 4c), but in the tr. opts for two acc. in parallel (‘swell the refreshments, (swell) the cow’), as does Schmidt (p. 153).

The root-noun cmpd surúc- (9x) is generally a bahuvrīhi meaning ‘having good light, very bright’, as in II.2.4 tám … candrám iva surúcam “him [=Agni] very bright like gold.” For just this passage Gr posits a substantivization: f. ‘heller Glanz’.

This is unnecessary, as surúcaḥ here can be a fem. pl. acc. picking up and modifying f. pl. íṣah in c (and indeed the glittering pṛ́kṣaḥ in b). It obviously forms an etymological figure with the opt. rurucyāḥ.

As for this verb, it should have transitive/causative value (‘make shine / illuminate’), and it therefore functionally overlaps with the redupl. aor. árūruca-.

This overlap is complicated by the fact that several apparent pf. forms rurucuḥ also have this value, in some of which lengthening the redupl. to *rūrucuḥ would provide a better cadence, though in our passage such a lengthening would produce a worse cadence. For disc. of these ambiguous forms see comm. ad IV.7.1, 16.4. As I say there, because the 3rd sg. pf. ruroca and the pf. part. are intransitive, I am inclined to think that the transitive 3rd pl. forms originated in the redupl. aor. but were absorbed by the pf., with shortening of the redupl. vowel.
