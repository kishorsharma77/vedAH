By my interpr. (and Ge’s), pādas ab contain a series of adjacent -bhyaḥ plural nominals, which by sense must be sorted into dative pl. tanūkṛ́dbhyaḥ (“for the body-makers”) and ablative pl. dvéṣobhyo anyákṛtebhyaḥ (“from hateful things done by others”). The pāda break assists in splitting up these formally identical forms. A different interpr., going back to the MS (see Ge’s n. 3a) and followed by Re, however, takes tanūkṛ́d- in passive sense ‘done by oneself’ and contrastively parallel to anyákṛta- ‘done by others’; in this case, tanūkṛ́dbhyaḥ is also ablative. The deliberate contrast between the root noun -kṛ́t- in the first compound and the past passive participle -kṛta- in the second and the usual active, transitive sense of -kṛ́t- in compounds (including the other occurrence of tanūkṛ́t-) make this interpr. unlikely.

See Old for disc.; he opts for the active sense, but considers the tanū- in question to belong to the doers/makers referred to by -kṛ́t-: “(den Frommen), die tätig sind sich die eigne tanū́zu schaffen.” (Scar weakly favors this.) This seems unnecessarily complex, though the usual polarity between tanū- ‘self’ and anyá- ‘other’ is an argument in its favor.
