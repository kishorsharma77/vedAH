For the sense of this complex vs. and its relation to the rest of the hymn, see publ. intro. The point of the verse appears be that our hymns, however frenetic (a), are no longer effective (b), and therefore the activity of Indra and Varuṇa on behalf of their partners [=us] is in abeyance (cd).

With the standard tr. I supply ‘hymns’ with the opening imā́(ḥ): imā́gíraḥ is pretty common.

The praise hymns to Indra and Varuṇa appear to be whirlwinds (bhṛmáyaḥ) to us, but they cannot be ‘thrust/brandished’ (ná tújyā(ḥ)) by the devotees of the gods -- that is, they have lost their oomph, their energy, and therefore their effectiveness. For the connection between bhṛmí- and √tuj, cf. IV.32.2 bhṛ́miś cid ghāsi tū́tujiḥ “You are a whirlwind, constantly lunging” of Indra. For the connection of hymns with √tuj, cf. V.17.3 tujā́girā́. Despite its position, ná in b should be the negative, not the simile marker. See Old.

On sína- see comm. ad II.30.2.

I take sma as indicating habitual action.
