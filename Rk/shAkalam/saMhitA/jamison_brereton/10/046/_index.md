Agni  
Vatsaprī Bhālandana  
10 verses: triṣṭubh (and virāj)  
Attributed to the same poet as X.45, this hymn is clearly a companion piece to the  previous hymn, sharing much of the same specialized lexicon (e.g., uśíj “fire-priest”)  and an interest in the various forms and births of fire and their relation to the  ritual fire. However, X.46 is, for the most part, more rhetorically driven and more  obscurely phrased than X.45, with images pushed to the edge of intelligibility (and  beyond; see, e.g., vs. 7). The trickiness of its phraseology is matched by its meter, a  shifting combination of triṣṭubh and virāj lines, with a number analyzable as either.  Nonetheless, the emphasis on the installation of the ritual fire is manifest through out: the original installation (vss. 4, 8–10), the reinstallation of the disappearing  Agni (vss. 2–3), and the current installation (vss. 5–6).
