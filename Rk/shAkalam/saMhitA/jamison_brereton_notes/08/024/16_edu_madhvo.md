I supply siñcá from b as the verb also of a, and supply madíntaram of a as the object of b, with ándhasaḥ dependent on it as mádhvaḥ is in a. Ge by contrast (fld. by Klein DGRV II.183) supplies “bring” in a and takes ándhasaḥ as a partitive genitive in b. This is not impossible, but my interpretation requires less extraneous material.

Another cross-tṛca connection: evā́in c echoes eváthā in 15c. More cleverly, 16ab éd u m(ádhvo)… siñcá picks up 13a éndum … siñcata (note that édum and éndum are almost identical).
