The adj. sujātá- ‘well-born’ generally refers to gods, or at least to mortals; it is only here used of material goods (implicitly vasavyà- in the preceding pāda, hence my ‘of good quality’. Of course, it is possible that vasavyà- here refers, at least partly, to human capital (sons), as apparently in II.9.5 ubháyam te ná kṣīyate vasavyàm ... krdhi páti ̥ ṃ svapatyásya rāyáḥ, where the second category of “goods of both types” (ubháyam … vasavyàm) is “wealth in good descendents” (svapatyásya rāyáḥ). But I don’t think this is a necessary interpr.: “well-born/produced” is likely available to semantic extension. 87
