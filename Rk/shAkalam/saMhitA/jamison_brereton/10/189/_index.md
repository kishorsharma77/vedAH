Sārparājñı or Su ̄ ̄rya  
Sārparājñī  
3 verses: gāyatrī  
The Anukramaṇī assigns this hymn either to Sūrya or to the shadowy figure  Sārparājñī ([female] descendant of the Queen of the Snakes), who is also said to  be its author. The former identification seems far more likely, or, rather, the hymn  appears to be set at the dawn sacrifice and to play with the various sources of light

that compete and combine at that time: the sun and the ritual fire, as well as Dawn  (vs. 2ab). The fire, and in part its counterpart the sun, is portrayed as a variety of  animals: a (male) cow (vs. 1), a buffalo (vs. 2), and a bird. The association of speech  with the bird is also found in the Pataṃga hymn (X.177) and probably reflects the  importance of ritual speech at the dawn sacrifice. There are no signs of snakes,  much less their queen.
