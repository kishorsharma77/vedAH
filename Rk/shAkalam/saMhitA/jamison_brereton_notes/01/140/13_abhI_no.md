The problem in this verse is to determine which pādas go together. Ge and Re construe ab and cd together, but this leads to a gender problem: the subj. of cd should be fem. pl. aruṇyàḥ in d, but c contains a nom. pl. masc. part. yántaḥ. (Old [SBE] suggests that this form is corrupt because of the metrical problems in the pāda; he treats these at length in Noten, but does not seem to favor emendation of the participle.) The problem is not entirely solved by taking c with (a)b, as Old (SBE) and I do, but it becomes somewhat attenuated by the variety of possible subjects: Agni (m.), Heaven and Earth (dyā́vā-kṣā́mā, dual dvandva, whose gender is listed by Gr. as fem., but there are no diagnostic passages), the rivers (síndhu-, sometimes fem., sometimes masc. [see common acc. pl. síndhūn]) -- with masc. prevailing either because masc. is the default in such gender clashes or because síndhavaḥ is the closest subject to yántaḥ. WG also take d with the nominatives of b, by somehow taking aruṇyàḥ as a temporal expression “bei den (Morgen)röten,” but one would expect a loc. for this meaning (as opposed to the extent of time in the temporal dīrghā́hā “through the long days” of c).
