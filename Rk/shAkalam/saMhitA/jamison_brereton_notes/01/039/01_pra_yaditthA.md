mā́na- seems to activate the same pun on the homonymous roots √mā as was noted in the preceding hymn, I.38.14. The Maruts project both their bellowing and the measure of their song. (Standard tr. only recognize the ‘measure’ sense.) “Like a flame” - what does śocíḥ correspond to in the frame of the passage? Ge (/WG) take it as parallel to “you” (=Maruts), as the agent of throwing, and supply an object “(ihren Schein).” But since śocís- is a neuter, it can as easily be an accusative and express the thrown object, and this seems to me the more likely interpretation (perhaps influenced by the modern flame-thrower). In a Marut context it could stand for the lightning they deploy in addition to the thunder represented by mā́nam. For further on this image see disc. at vs. 10.
