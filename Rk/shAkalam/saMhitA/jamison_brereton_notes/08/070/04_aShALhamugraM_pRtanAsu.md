In my view this verse is structurally parallel to vs. 2: pāda a continues the previous verse; b is a nominal relative clause; and cd may or may not go with b, but have unaccented verbs. Ge (n. to 2b) and Old also consider the verses parallel, but in the case of both verses they think that bc belong together despite the unaccented verbs of c(d). In separating b and c here I must supply a noun with the fem.

adjectives mahī́r urujráyaḥ -- and choose ‘waters’, since pl. ā́pas, apás is common with mahī́ḥ; ‘rivers’ would also be possible, so Ge, who seems to take mahī́ḥ simply as a designation of rivers (“die breitströmenden Flüsse”) without comment.
