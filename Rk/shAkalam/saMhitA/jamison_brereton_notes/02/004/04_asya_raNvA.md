The predicate adj. raṇvā́qualifies both puṣṭíḥ and sáṃdṛṣṭiḥ; for the latter see X.64.11 raṇváḥ sáṃdṛṣṭau.

I take dákṣu- as a pseudo-desid. u-participle; also dhákṣu- in X.115.4.

Because dodhavīti in d is unaccented, it cannot be the verb of the relative clause beginning with yáḥ in c, despite the standard tr. Instead the intensive part.

bháribhrat must be predicated in the rel. cl. and dodhavīti interpreted as the verb of the main clause.

Because of the equine simile and imagery, the primary reading of dodhavīti vā́rān must be “twitches his tail(-hairs),” but a second reading “shakes out choice things” is also invited.
