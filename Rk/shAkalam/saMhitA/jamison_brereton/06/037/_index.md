Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first three verses follow the model of a “journey” hymn, but with a twist. The  fallow bays of verse 1 are Indra’s familiar horses, bringing his chariot to the sacri fice, but the same word (hárayaḥ) in verse 2 refers to the tawny soma drops. In verse  3 we return to the real horses, qualified as “charging straight on,” just like the soma  in the previous verse. The mention of Vāyu in verse 3 identifies the ritual in question  as the Morning Pressing.  
The remaining two verses of the hymn (4–5) do not continue the journey theme.  Instead Indra is configured as a (divine) patron (vs. 5), who gives the priestly gift to  the (human) patrons (vs. 4). See VI.29 for a similar identification of Indra with the  sacrificial patron.
