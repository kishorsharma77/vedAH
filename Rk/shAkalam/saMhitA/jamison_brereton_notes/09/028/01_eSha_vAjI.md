hitáḥ is taken by all standard interpr. (Gr, Ge, Re) to √hi ‘impel’, as also by me, presumably because of the verb of motion, ví dhāvati, that provides the finite verb in the vs. But it could, of course, belong to √dhā ‘place’. This alternative interpr. is almost encouraged by vs. 4bc daśábhir jāmíbhir yatáḥ / abhí dróṇani dhāvati “(Soma,) held by the ten siblings, runs to the wooden cups,” where a ppl. of static position (yatáḥ) precedes the same verb of motion.

On viśva-víd- see comm. ad 27.3. Because of mánasas pátiḥ (note close sandhi) “lord of mind,” I interpr. the cmpd as ‘all-knowing’ here.
