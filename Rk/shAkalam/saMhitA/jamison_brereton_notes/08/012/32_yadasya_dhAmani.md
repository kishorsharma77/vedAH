Contrary to Ge, I take pāda c as part of the subordinate clause of ab, with vs. 33 the main clause. Ge. is forced to supply a verb (“geht”).

dohánā is the problem here. Gr suggests we read it as underlying dohánās as in I.144.2, despite the sandhi. This seems to be the basis of Ge’s interpretation (“die Melkung” as subject), but Old rejects this and takes it as an instrumental. I weakly follow Old, but neither of the interpretations is particularly compelling.
