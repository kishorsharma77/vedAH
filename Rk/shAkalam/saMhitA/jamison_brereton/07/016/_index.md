Agni  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
12 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas  
The hymn emphasizes the exchange mediated by Agni, who takes the oblations to  the gods (or brings the gods to the oblations) and who offers sustenance to the sac rificers (see esp. vs. 2cd). Because he thus nourishes both gods and humans, he is the  “child of nourishment” (vs. 1). The poet repeatedly mentions the patron or patrons  of the rite alongside the priests. Agni himself is not only the Hotar, who recites, and  the Potar, who purifies the soma, but also the householder, who is the patron of the  rite (vs. 5). In verse 6 the poet calls on Agni to sharpen not only the priests but also  the one who “praises well” and “is skillful,” a combination of the ability to recite  and the ability to perform the rites. The latter may be a priest, but it might be again  the householder, who is also a participant in the rite and who owns, in a sense, all of  the priestly functions. In verses 7–10 the poet asks Agni to bless generous patrons, who give cattle (vs. 7) and horses along with other gifts (vs. 10). In the final two  verses the poet addresses his fellow priests, urging them to prepare ample offerings  for the gods, but at the end he especially mentions the rewards of wealth and good  men for “the pious man,” who again is likely the householder.
