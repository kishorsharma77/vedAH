The first two pādas contain two punning verbs, whose double meanings reinforce each other: mimīhí can belong to √mā ‘bellow’ and √mā ‘measure’ (generally assigned only to the latter and so tr.). In the first meaning it refers to the sound of the song, in the second to its regulated production, that is, to its meter.

tatanaḥ can belong to √tan ‘thunder’ and √tan ‘stretch out’ (Gr assigns to the former, but standard tr. reflect the latter). In the first meaning it again refers to the sound of the song, in the second, again to its method of production - in this case, the prolonging of a tone or note. The second meanings of both verbs clearly belong to the technical vocabulary of singing (see the next pāda, 14c, as well), the former connect the poet’s sounds to those of the Maruts’ thunderstorm (cf. mimāti ‘bellows’ in 8a).
