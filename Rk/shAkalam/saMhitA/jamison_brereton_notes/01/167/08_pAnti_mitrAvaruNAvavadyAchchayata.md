Because the verb in pāda a, pā́nti, is plural, not dual, at least one additional subject is needed in addition to du. mitrā́váruṇā. The obvious one to supply is their partner Aryaman, who appears in the next pāda.

In d Old, Ge, Re, and WG identify dā́tivāraḥ ‘wish-granting’ as the mortal sacrificer, although, as they all acknowledge, the other two occurrences of this stem modify the Maruts (III.51.9, V.58.2) and therefore the Maruts should be presumed to be the default referent here as well. I see no reason to contravene this expectation. In V.58.2 the adjective is singular, modifying gaṇá- ‘flock’, a regular cover term for the Maruts, and I have supplied gaṇá- here as well. I also consider d to be an unsignaled dependent clause “(when),” indicating the circumstances under which the unstirrable things stir (c), viz. when the Maruts get strong. The verb would have accent in any case because it is initial in its pāda. I do not, however, understand the īm in d, which has no referent, since vāvṛdhé is intransitive (pace Gr). Taking the Maruts as the subj.

of vāvṛdhé also fits nicely with 9, which treats the “swelling strength” (śávas-) of the Maruts.
