The first hemistich has distinct sexual overtones, with the Earth spreading herself to receive the Maruts’ “embryo” -- though it is more decorously phrased than V.56.3.

It is difficult to get a causal reading from hí in c. It cannot be connected with the preceding pāda, and the action of c seems irrelevant to d, so connection with the following pāda seems unlikely. I have settled for the craven ‘certainly’.
