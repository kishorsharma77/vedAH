Seems deliberately to echo the last vs. of the preceding hymn (I.4.10), with pāda b índram abhí prá gāyata “sing forth to Indra” matching I.4.10c tásmai índrāya gāyata “sing to him, to Indra” (the difference in case being governed by the presence of the preverb abhí in I.5.1). I.4.10 is then exactly repeated in I.5.4c. The sákhāyaḥ of I.5.1c also recalls I.4.10b sákhā — though the latter refers to Indra and the former to the priest-poets. But I.4.4c contains a pl. sákhibhyaḥ, which in our analysis has the same human referents as I.5.1, showing the reciprocal relation between men and gods that was one of the points of I.4.
