Although Ge takes śáśvatī as a personal name, and indeed the name of the poet’s wife, in this dānastuti context it’s far more likely that the woman in question is part of the gift, and śáśvatī here can be seen as a semantic development of the literal meaning of the stem śáśvant- ‘each and every, one after the other, ever and always’ can develop to ‘constant, reliable, always available/ready.’ The woman is “ever ready” for sex, at least in the poet’s imagination. For a slightly different development of *śaś(-vant-), in the comparative śáśīyas-, also applied to a woman, see V.61.6.
