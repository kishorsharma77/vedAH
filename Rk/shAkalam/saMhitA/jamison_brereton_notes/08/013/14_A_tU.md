Although Ge interprets the stretching of the thread as a metaphorical expression for the continuation of old relationships, it seems far more likely that it reflects the normal idiom “stretch the thread” for setting up and performing the sacrifice. See vs. 18b devā́so yajñám atnata. “The way that is known” means the standard procedure. That Indra is being urged to do this, rather than the sacrificers, might be a little odd, but see, in fact, 18b just cited, as well as 30c mímīte yajñám.
