As noted in the publ. intro., the vs. seems to contain a paradox, whereby the masc. Soma conceives an embryo, most likely of himself. See Ge’s n. 4c.

The hapax urubjá- is puzzling. Gr’s suggestion that it derives from a phonological deformation of *ud-ubjá- seems reasonable, esp., as Mayrhofer points out (EWA s.v. UBJ), with the interference of urú-. Verbal forms of úd √ubj are found in AVŚ and TS.
