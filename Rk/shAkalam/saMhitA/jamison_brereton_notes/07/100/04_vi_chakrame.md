By concentrating Viṣṇu’s strides in the first pāda of 4, the poet is free to express the aim of Viṣṇu’s action -- creating space and dwelling places for the people

-- in the rest of the vs. As Ge points out (n. 4c), asya can refer either to Viṣṇu or to Manu, although in actuality this may not matter. It may be an instance of “trickle-down” ownership: Viṣṇu makes a dwelling place for Manu, and in turn Manu’s people also get firmly planted. Or, Manu and the people may both be under Viṣṇu’s auspices.
