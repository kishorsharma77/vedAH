3 verses: triṣṭubh
Like X.179 this hymn is tightly tied to the Pravargya ritual—in this case celebrating  the great sāmans associated with that ritual, the Rathantara and the Br̥hat, and the  gharma, the hot milk offering that is its high point.
## 1
Whose name is “Spread” and “Wide-spread,” which is the oblation of the  oblation in anuṣṭubh meter:
from the flashing Founder and from Savitar and Viṣṇu has Vasiṣṭha
carried here the Rathaṃtara.
## 2
They found what was placed beyond, what was the highest hidden  domain of the sacrifice:
from the flashing Founder and from Savitar and Viṣṇu, from Agni, has  Bharadvāja brought here the Br̥hat.
## 3
They found, as they reflected with their mind, the yajus that sprang forth  first, going the way of the gods:
from the flashing Founder and from Savitar and Viṣṇu, from the sun,  have they carried here the hot milk (gharma).
