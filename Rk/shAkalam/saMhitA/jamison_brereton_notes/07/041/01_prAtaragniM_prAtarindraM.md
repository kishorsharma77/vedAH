As was just noted, this vs. is in Jagatī in an otherwise Triṣṭubh hymn (and hymn sequence) -- or rather its first three quarters are. The final pāda is in Triṣṭubh and ends with the verb 1st pl. opt. huvema, which gives a Triṣṭubh cadence and also ends the first pāda of the next vs. (2a), contrasting with its semantic match 1st pl. pres.

indic. havāmahe in the first pāda (1a), which provides a Jagatī cadence. The switch in meter at the end of the vs., cleverly accomplished while holding the verb essentially constant, and the variant repetition of the opening of the 2nd hemistich, prātár bhágam, at the opening of vs. 2, prātar(-jítam) bhágam, knit the 1st vss. together despite the metrical difference and the range of gods in vs. 1.
