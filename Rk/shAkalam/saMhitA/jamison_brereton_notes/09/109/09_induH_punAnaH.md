In all clear cases urāṇá- is passive, ‘being chosen’ (see comm. ad IV.6.3).

Gr, Ge, and Re all take it as trans. with prajā́m as obj., but there is no reason why this acc. can’t be taken as an obj. of kárat, parallel to víśvāni drávaṇāni.

kárat opening the 2nd hemistich rhymes with kṣárat in the same position in vs. 8. Nonetheless they are morphologically divergent, with kárat a subjunctive and kṣárat an injunc. Despite their parallelism kṣárat is unlikely to have modal value anticipating kárat; KH (123 and n. 26) convincingly takes kṣárat in “general” sense.
