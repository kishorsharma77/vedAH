bhū́riśṛṅga- is tr. by all as ‘many-horned’, but this doesn’t make a lot of sense: each cow should have only two horns, unless Viṣṇu and Indra’s dwelling is a place of fantasy creatures. I have therefore rendered it ‘ample-horned’, meaning that the horns are quite sizeable. ‘Many-horned’ would be possible if the reference is to the whole herd of cattle: each cow has two horns, but the collectivity has many. I still prefer ‘ample’.
