This vs. contains yet another hapax, duvasanā́so in a, but in this case the form seems to have been generated to form a pair with its phonological near match tuviṣvaṇáso in b (with its last two syllables also matching preceding śyenā́so, which it modifies). It is generally connected (see Re ad loc., EWA s.v. dūrá-) with dūrá- ‘distant’, dávīyas-/daviṣṭha ‘further, furthest’, but the exact morphology is unclear.

On semantic grounds it seems unlikely to be related to dúvas- ‘friendship’. For a similar deformation of this lexical complex, see duvanyasát in IV.40.2, which also owes some of its phonological shape to its formulaic partner.
