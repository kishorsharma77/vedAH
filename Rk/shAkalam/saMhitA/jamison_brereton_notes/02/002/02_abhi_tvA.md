Ge (/WG) take náktīr uṣásaḥ as acc. of extent of time, supplying as subj. either prayers or priests. With Old (SBE and Noten) and Re, I take the phrase as subject in the publ. tr. This means that uṣásaḥ must be taken as a nom. (for uṣā́saḥ), rather than the acc. it was historically -- but this is common in the RV. On reflection I wonder if Ge is right: the 2nd hemistich contains two examples of acc. of extent of time (mā́nuṣā yugā́and kṣápaḥ), and there is also one in 8a, uṣáso rā́myāḥ, that is very similar to the phrasing here. If the phrase is interpr. as acc., the subject to be supplied would presumably be the same as the 2nd pl. addressees of 1ab, namely the priestly officiants. So I suggest an alt. tr. “Through the dawns and the nights they [=priests] bellow towards you …” In addition the pf. vavāśire might better be rendered as a habitual pres.

‘(constantly) bellow’.
