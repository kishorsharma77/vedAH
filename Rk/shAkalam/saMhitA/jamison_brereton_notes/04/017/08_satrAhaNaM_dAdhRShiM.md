The first half of this vs., describing Indra, is couched in the accusative, on which the rel. cl. of cd depends. Since both the preceding and following vss. refer to Indra in the nominative, this vs. is syntactically untethered. It seems best to supply an anodyne verb like “I call upon,” even though this cannot be generated from the immediate context.

Note that the satrā of vs. 6 has returned, though in a cmpd.
