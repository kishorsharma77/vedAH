Maruts
Kaṇva Ghaura
15 verses: gāyatrī, probably organized in tr̥cas
Typical Marut themes fill this hymn: their glittering beauty (lightning), their noise  (thunder), and their boisterous character, which strikes fear in both animate and  inanimate nature. The mystery of their birth, also a common feature of Marut  hymns, is mentioned glancingly in verse 9. The language is uncomplex, but as in  many Marut hymns it is energetic and visual, and it often has a conversational tone,  as in the depiction of thunder in verse 13 as the Maruts talking among themselves  as they travel.
