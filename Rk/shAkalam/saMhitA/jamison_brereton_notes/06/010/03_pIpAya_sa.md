This vs. also appears to be deliberately misleading, though less so than vs. 2.

It begins pīpā́ya sá “he becomes swollen.” Although √pī ‘swell’ is not a particularly Agnaic verb, it still could be applicable to the ritual fire, and the audience might expect an unidentified subject to be the deity of the hymn. But the second pāda, with dat. agnáye and nom. vípraḥ, contravenes our expectations: it is the poet who becomes swollen, as a result of his successful service to Agni.

I would emend the tr. of pāda a: śrávasā should be rendered ‘with fame’, not ‘with praise’.
