You in whom heaven in its entirety [=all the gods] will now perform  sacrifice, as it were—you the very clever, the means of sacrifice,
the king—
(you) with your three seats, like the plumage of (a bird) that has
traversed (the sky?), are to sacrifice the oblations, the bounties of the  sons of Manu.
