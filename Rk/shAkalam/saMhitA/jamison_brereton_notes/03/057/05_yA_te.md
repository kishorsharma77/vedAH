The two descriptors of Agni’s tongue, mádhumatī ‘possessing honey’ and sumedhā́(ḥ) ‘very wise’, seem almost to clash in their juxtaposition, but they were probably chosen to reflect two different aspects of the tongue. On the one hand, Agni’s tongues of flame flare up when the libations are poured upon them; ‘honey’ presumably here refers to these libations (rather than to soma, despite the common identification of soma with honey; soma would put the flames out if poured on them).

But real tongues, the kind that produce speech, can be qualified as ‘very wise’ because of that speech, and the crackling of the ritual fire often stands for ritual speech.
