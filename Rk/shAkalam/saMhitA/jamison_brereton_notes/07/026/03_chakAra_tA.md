On ní √mṛj see comm. ad II.38.3. The idiomatic sense ‘drag down forcefully’ (as in I.140.2, where Agni drags down trees like an elephant) allows the idiom to develop a sense not only of coercion (on the part of the agent) but of submission (on the part of the object), which is probably responsible for its use of a husband’s action towards his wives.

The use of sárva- rather than víśva- for ‘all’ may be a sign of lateness.
