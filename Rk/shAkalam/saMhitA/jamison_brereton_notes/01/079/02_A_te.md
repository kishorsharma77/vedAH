Again, the interpretation of the image in pāda a depends on what the referent is. Most (Ge, Re, WG) take suparṇā́(ḥ) as referring to Agni’s flames as birds. These flames transform themselves (ā́… aminanta) into storm clouds. As indicated in the publ. intro., I instead think this verse develops the image of Agni as lightning found in 1b. The suparṇā́ḥ are then the lightning flashes. This entails a somewhat bold interpretation of the verb (though I would say no bolder than ‘transform themselves’, for which no parallels are cited), from ‘change, exchange, alternate’ to the physical image ‘zigzag’, from ‘change/alternate back and forth’. The middle of √mī is several times used of night and dawn swapping their colors back and forth (I.96.5, 113.2), which can be conceived of as an alternating pattern like zigzags. Against the flickering light of the lightning there appears the black bull, that is, the thunder cloud, in b. The nonce perfect nonāva, backformed to the intensive (see the repeated nonumaḥ of the immed. preceding hymn I.78), I take as presential, with Narten (1981 “Vedisch lelā́ya,” p. 2 with nn. 7, 8, = KlSch. p. 234), against most comm., although no harm would come of taking it as a preterite.

The pāda-final tag yádīmám is curious. It cannot be part of what precedes, since nonāva is unaccented. The same phrase is found at IV.5.11, where I tr. “if it is here.” I interpret it in the same fashion here, but in addition assume an enjambement with the following pāda. Others keep it within its half verse (which I would prefer), but in their interpretation the phrase seems like mere filler (e.g., Ge’s “wenn dies (so ist)”).

The smiling females of c must be the lightning flashes (so also Ge, Re); cf. V.52.6 vidyútaḥ … jájjhatīr iva “lightning flashes like giggling (girls).” Old (SBE): rain showers, WG (tentatively): dawns. The “he,” subject of ā́gāt is the black bull of b, the thundercloud as roaring fire.

For the semantic connection between these parts of the thunderstorm and the aspects of fire see the publ. intro.
