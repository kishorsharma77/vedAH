The bahuvrīhi ródha-cakra-, lit. ‘having their banks as wheels’, may seem slightly jarring, and Ge (/WG) attenuate the sense to “die die Ufer entlang rollen.” But cakrá- is definitely the noun ‘wheel’ (all the way back into PIE), not a transparent derivative of a verbal root meaning ‘roll’, and I think the cmpd must be taken in its literal sense. (So also Re: “ayant pour roues les hautes-rives.”) The point of comparison must be not the speed or movement of the chariot but its physical configuration, with the wheels defining the outer limits of the vehicle as seen from above or behind and rising above the bottom of its body, just as river banks do the river.

A different watery image is found in the 2nd hemistich. With Ge I take táraḥ here as a ford (like the etymologically related tīrthá-, both to √tṝ ‘cross, pass,’ etc.) or perhaps more generally a means of crossing (water). Bṛhaspati, likened to a bird of prey, keeps his eye on both the ford and the (deeper) waters -- presumably watching for fish to swim into the shallow water of the ford, so they can be snatched close to the surface. This image is highly reminiscent of the feeding behavior of water birds like cranes, egrets, and herons, whose preternatural stillness and singleminded vigilance as they stand in shallow water waiting for prey, followed by a swift but graceful lunge with their beaks, can only impress the observer and could well provide a model for the “knowing Bṛhaspati” and his sharp eyes depicted here. (For those who haven’t had the pleasure of seeing this in the wild, there are numerous YouTube videos.) Such birds are found in the appropriate geographical areas of NW India/Pakistan, and since gṛ́dhra- lit. means ‘greedy’, it need not specifically designate a vulture, pace Ge (/WG), Schmidt (‘Geier’), and Re (‘vautour’).

ā́paḥ here must be acc. pl., one of the handful of examples of the spread of the nom. pl. to acc. function in this stem.
