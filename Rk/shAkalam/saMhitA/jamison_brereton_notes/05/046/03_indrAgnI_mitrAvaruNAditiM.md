The previous vs. consisted of vocatives in ab and nominatives in cd. Here we find accusatives, with the governing verb huvé postponed until the beginning of the 2nd hemistich. The first four divinities in vss. 2 and 3 are the same, but the four individual vocc. ágna índra váruṇa mítra of 2a are arranged in 3a in two dual dvandvas indrāgnī́and mitrā́váruṇā, in opposite order. The Maruts, Viṣṇu, Pūṣan, and Bhaga (bhága-) are also repeated from vs. 2. Otherwise the emphasis is on divinized natural elements. As for female divinities, we find Aditi immediately after her offspring Mitra and Varuṇa, as well as the waters (apáḥ).

Unfortunately the repetition of bhága- is obscured in the publ. tr. by its rendering as “Fortune” in 3d, though both 2d and 6c call him Bhaga. “Fortune” in 3 should therefore be changed to “Bhaga.”
