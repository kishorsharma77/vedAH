Old takes śaśā(ḥ) to √śā ‘sharpen’ rather than √śās ‘order’ (as does Re, judging from his portmanteau and barely comprehensible tr. “as-chassé-comme-enaiguisant”), but there seems no advantage in this. Neither root is found elsewhere with níḥ, but a literal additive tr. of níḥ √śās works well here. And √śā does not have a reduplicated form of this shape, whereas √śās has a pf. śaśāsa (etc.), to which this can be a (plupf.) injunctive. So Kü (521), as well as Gr, etc. The níḥ found in vss. 2 and 4 (also 10), also of the expulsion of Vṛtra, may account for the use of this preverb here: it seems to be a signature word of this hymn.
