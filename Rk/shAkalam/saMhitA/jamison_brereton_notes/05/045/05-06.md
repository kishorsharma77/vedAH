As noted in the publ. intro., these two vss. form an omphalos and are structurally parallel, with the poet addressing his priest-poet colleagues with hortatory subjunctives. The immediacy of the vss. and the sacrificial context of the hymn make this a more likely scenario than Sāy.’s suggestion that the Aṅgirases are speaking these vss. For strenuous arguments against Sāy.’s interpr., see Lü p. 327.
