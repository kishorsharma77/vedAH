As slowly becomes clear, this vs. concerns the Vala myth, as the last pāda, describing the opening of “the doors of the firm-fixed stone,” illustrates. This slipping into the Vala story accounts for the otherwise puzzling áṅgirastamā ‘best / most like the Aṅgirases’ in the previous vs. (3d; found also in nearby VII.75.1, also in a potential Vala context). The Aṅgirases, of course, were responsible, along with Indra, for opening the Vala cave and releasing the imprisoned cows; they did so by singing. As Ge points out, the praisers who benefit from Dawn’s largesse in 4b are most likely the Aṅgirases, and they would also then be the subjects of c.

Note the phonetic echo between rā́dho (a) and (á)rado (b), which is then found scrambled in d (dú)ro ádr(eḥ). Pāda d also contains internal phonetic play with d’s and r’s, as well as a, u, and o: … dṛḷh(asya) dúro, adr(e)r äūr(ṇ)o(ḥ). This is the only trisyllabic reading of the augmented stem aurṇo- and the vowel hiatus a-ū (or av ū?) emphasizes the phonetic figures.

The verb in c, the pf. jajñúḥ, is perfectly ambiguous between √jan ‘beget’ and √jñā ‘recognize’. It is now standardly taken to the former, though Ge previously (Ved. St.) assigned it to the latter, a stance criticized by Old and silently given up by Ge in his tr.
