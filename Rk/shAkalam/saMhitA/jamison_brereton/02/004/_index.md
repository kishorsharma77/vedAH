Agni  
Somāhuti Bhārgava  
9 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn first concerns itself with the installation of the ritual fire (vss. 1–3). There  follows a naturalistic description, rich in metaphor and simile, of a fire first catching  and then flaming up (vss. 4–7). The hymn ends with two verses requesting benefits  for the Gr̥tsamada clan (8–9). Oblique references to the myth of the recovery of the  vanished fire in verses 2 and 9 provide the hymn with a larger ring-like structure.
