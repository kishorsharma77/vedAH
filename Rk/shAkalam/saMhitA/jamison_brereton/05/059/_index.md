Maruts  
Śyāvāśva Ātreya  
8 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 8  
This hymn is constructed around a series of similes and metaphors, some of which  (see esp. 3a) push the boundaries of similarity and require a mental leap from the  audience, while in others (e.g., 3d) the near identity between the two entities com pared renders the simile-marking almost redundant. The hymn’s subject, as usual,  is the power of the Maruts on their travels, power manifested both as the storm  and as a warriors’ onslaught. The puzzles in this hymn begin with its opening: no  entirely satisfactory referent for the “scout” or “spy” of 1a has been found, though  many have been suggested.
