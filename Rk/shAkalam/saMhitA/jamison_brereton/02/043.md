See the remarks on II.42.
## 1
Turning toward the right the bards sing welcome—the birds speaking at  their proper season, the birds of omen.
It speaks both speeches like a sāman-singer: it regulates both gāyatrī and  triṣṭubh meters. 
## 2
Like the Udgātar, o omen-bird, you sing the sāman. Like the Son of the  Sacred Formulation, you recite at the pressings.
Like a bullish prize-winner [=stallion] when he has approached (mares)  with young, speak auspiciously to us in every way, omen-bird—
speak pleasantly to us in all ways, omen-bird.
## 3
When you are speaking, omen-bird, speak auspiciously; when you are  sitting silently, take note of our good thought.
When, as you fly up, you speak like a lute... – May we speak loftily at the  ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes.III
