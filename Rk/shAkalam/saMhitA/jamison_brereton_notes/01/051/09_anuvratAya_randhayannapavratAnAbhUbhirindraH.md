The avratá- ‘having no commandment’ of 8b is transformed into the even less savory ápavrata- ‘against/rejecting commandments’ and contrasted with their opposite number, the ánuvrata- ‘following commandments’.

The image of Indra’s transformation into an ant (vamrá-) presumably concerns his ability to pass unnoticed in the enemy camp and then bring the fortifications down from within. However, “smashing apart” (ví √han) doesn't seem a likely action for an ant, or even a huge nest of ants, so the combined image is somewhat unsettled.

The identity of the enemy in this hemistich is not clear. The other occurrence of the phrase dyā́m ínakṣant- (X.45.7) refers to Agni, but that identification seems unlikely here. It should also be noted that the other genitive phrase referring to this enemy, vṛddhásya cid várdhataḥ “the one who, though already full grown, kept growing,” is grammatically problematic because the active present participle várdhant- should be transitive, as the rest of this extremely well-attested active inflection is. Gotō (1987: 291) notes the problem but has no explanation either.

Expected middle *várdhamānasya would of course not fit this metrical position, but that is not enough for a Rigvedic poet to contravene grammar. However, the active part. more nearly matches the paired ppl. phonologically: vṛddha… vardha…, and this may have influenced the poet to use the active form.
