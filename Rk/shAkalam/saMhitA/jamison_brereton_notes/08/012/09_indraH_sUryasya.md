Ge takes the simile in c agnír váneva with ab: “Indra brennt … den Arśasāna nieder, wie Agni die Bäume,” with sāsahíḥ only construed with the refrain: “der Siegreiche ist erstarkt” (though see his n. on 9c). But this violates the structure of the rest of the hymn, where the c pāda hangs together. I therefore take the quality held in common between simile and frame to be sāsahíḥ. For √sah with this simile see VIII.40.1 yénā dṛḷhā́… sāhiṣīmahi / agnír váneva... “by which we might become victorious over the strongholds … as Agni (is victorious) over the woods,” and for the reduplicated -i-stem governing the accusative III.16.4 cákrir yó víśvā bhúvanābhí sāsahíḥ “Who creates and overwhelms all living beings…” On this nominal type and its syntactic behavior, see Grestenberger 2013 (JAOS 133).

Arśasāna is an enemy of Indra in the RV about whom little is known.

VIII.12.10, 12: The verb initiating the refrain, mímīte, is accented, and in these two verses the accent can be explained as a result of the status of the refrain; see above ad vss. 5-6. In 11 it starts a new clause and can owe its accent to that.
