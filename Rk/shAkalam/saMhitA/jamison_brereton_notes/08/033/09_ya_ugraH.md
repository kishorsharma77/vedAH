At first glance it is hard to find a concessive sense for the pres. part. sán in pāda a, despite its usual value. Indeed Ge takes ab as an independent nominal clause and begins a new sentence in c. However, the idea may be that although Indra is very tough and primed for battle, he’ll drop everything and come when we call him to the sacrifice.

The sense ‘perfected’ for sáṃskṛta- may be anachronistic; if so, ‘entirely readied’ or the like can substitute.
