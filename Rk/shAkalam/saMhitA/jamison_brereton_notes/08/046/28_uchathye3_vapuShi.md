title = "28"

Another virtually impenetrable verse. Rather than discuss my deviations from others’ interpretations, I will just set out the considerations that produced my own translation.

I take the referent of the yáḥ in the relative clauses that dominate vss. 26-28 to be Vāyu in all cases. In this verse there’s the embarrassment of the voc. vāyo, but since there is no verb in 28 nothing prevents it from being couched in the 2nd sg. The utá in b I take as connecting ucathyè vápuṣi and ghr̥tasnā́ḥ, both used of the svarā́ṭ, despite their different cases.

I think cd represents a new clause, with implied “your”; the prā́jma is rather like prā́dhvaré in 18, with verb extruded from the prá. The last little bit, idám nú tát, is a separate clause (like nūnám [áty] átha in 15-16).
