My “with” tr. of pāda b obscures what I think the grammatical structure is.

Pace Gr and Old, on accentual grounds navajvārá- should not be a bahuvrīhi, but rather a karmadhāraya ‘new suffering’. The question is what relationship its pāda bears to the previous one. Re’s suppressed purpose clause (or so his supplied “qu’il n’y ait” suggests) may be the best possibility syntactically. If we simply assume an imperatival “let there not be …” (so Maurer, sim. WG “nicht (sei uns)…”), parallel to pāda a, we should expect mā́, not ná as the negative. It may be, however, that existential prohibitives (of the “let there not be” type) are blocked, because the root √as ‘be’ does not build an aorist and also lacks injunctive present forms, although functionally similar mā́bhūt does occur. I have not found a discussion of this issue in Hoffmann 1967, but I may have missed it.
