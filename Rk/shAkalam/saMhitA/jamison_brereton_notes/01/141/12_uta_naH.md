The acc. goals in d, vāmáṃ suvitáṃ vásyaḥ, may be a triplet (with vāmám and suvitám separate; so Ge, Re, WG); it is not easy to tell and has little effect on sense.

The hapax splv. néṣatama-, to the unattested a-stem *néṣa-, is generally taken as agentive (‘best leader[s]’; e.g., Ge “mit den besten Führen”), but I see no reason for this. The expression seems parallel to II.23.4 sunītíbhir nayasi "you guide with good guidance," X.63.13 náyathā sunītíbhiḥ, where agentive readings are out. (Note that in both passages the abstract is in the plural, as here.) Moreover, since Agni is doing the leading, he would not need additional leaders (though WG suggest that they are the horses in pāda a). In any case note the ring with anayanta in 1d.
