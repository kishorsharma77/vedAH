As Re also notes, the vs. is strongly marked by v-alliteration, esp. in c: … vṛ́ṣaṇam vayodhā́m (a), … avāvaśanta vā́ṇīḥ (b), vánā vásāno váruṇo … (c), ví … vā́ryāṇi (d). Note also the parallel root-noun cmpds vayo-dhā́m (a) and ratna-dhā́(ḥ) (d), which latter also alliterates with dayate. For vayo-dhā́- see also vs. 6 below.
