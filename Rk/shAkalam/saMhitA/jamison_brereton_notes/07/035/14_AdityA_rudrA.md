title = "14"

The first hemistich refers, as often, to the hymn just concluding, with particular insistence on its absolute currency in the present moment, as shown by the 50 pres. participle and the comparative adj. ‘newer’: idám bráhma kriyámānaṃ návīyaḥ “this sacred formulation being made anew.” Who the “cow-born ones” are is debated (see, e.g., Ge, Re, and the long n. by Bl [RV Rep. 316-17]), a question I confess to finding not very interesting, perhaps because the longueurs of this hymn have dulled my senses.

The last phrase of 14, the afterthought nominal rel. cl. utá yé yajñíyāsaḥ, is probably meant to include all stray divinities and cosmic or natural elements that don’t fall under the first three categories (heavenly, earthly, cow-born) but might deserve worship. It might be better rendered “and those (others) who are worthy of the sacrifice.”
