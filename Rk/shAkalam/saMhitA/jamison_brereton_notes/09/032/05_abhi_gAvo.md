Both Ge and Re seem to make heavier weather of hitám than seems called for. Ge (n. 5c) suggests that the acc. is attraction from nom. *hitáḥ and tr. “Er ist wie ein angesporntes (Rennpferd) in das Wettrennen gegangen.” Re allows it to be acc. but not to modify ājím, requiring him to invent a second acc. phrase: “Elles sont allées [Re seems to have nodded on the number of the verb ágan; it cannot be the 3rd pl. of the root aor. to √gā, which is (á)gur, but must be 3rd sg. to the root aor. of √gam] dans l’arène comme (pour rejoindre le soma) mis en branle (par les prières).” I don’t understand the fuss: ājí- is masc.

(the supposed fem. ex. in I.116.15 is not), so hitám is grammatically fine. And I see no reason why a contest can’t be set, as a prize is. Perhaps it is their apparent conviction that hitám has to belong to √hi ‘impel’ that impelled them to these unconvincing makeshifts, or perhaps they believe that yáthā as a simile marker does not behave like ná and iva but requires a pseudo-clausal structure. But see the exx. in Gr’s no. 4 s.v. yáthā (col. 1083).
