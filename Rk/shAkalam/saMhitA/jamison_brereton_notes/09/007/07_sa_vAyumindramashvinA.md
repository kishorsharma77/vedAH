Gr takes ráṇā as impv. to √ran (them. pres. ráṇati), on the basis of the Pp. reading ráṇa, but it is better to interpr. it as instr. sg. to the root noun rán-, against the Pp. So already Old ZDMG 63 [1909]: 289 = KlSch 305; see also Ge (n. 7c), Schindler (Rt. Nouns, s.v. rán-). With Ge I take it as the referent of the rel. prn. yáḥ that immediately follows, forming a nominal cl. (“with the joy that is …”). The drawback to this is that the new cl.

would not coincide with a metrical break -- but nominal, izafe-like clauses are not infrequently so positioned. Re also takes ráṇā as an instr. sg., but because he expects such a root noun to have fem. gender (see Schindler, who simply says that the gender of this noun can’t be determined), he construes it as part of the rel. cl.: “(ivresse [referring back to mádena in b]) qui est joyeusement [= ráṇā] (présente) dans ces comportements.” Although this allows clause and metrical boundary to coincide, it otherwise seems too fussy to me.
