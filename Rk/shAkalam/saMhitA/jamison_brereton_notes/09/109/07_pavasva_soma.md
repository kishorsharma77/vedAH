The morphological identity of mahā́m is uncertain: it could be acc. sg. (m.) (see AiG III.251, etc.) or gen. pl. to máh- (so Gr) - or, in my opinion, nom. sg. masc.

to mahā́nt-. Most (Old, Ge, Re, Lub) take it as an acc., supplying ‘fleece’ or ‘back’, hence “along the great (fleece) of the sheep.” For detailed disc. see Old ad loc. and ad II.24.11. Although this is certainly possible, the filter is not usually so described.

A similar problem arises with a gen. pl. interpr., acdg. to which it would modify ávīnāmi “of the great sheep.” Since the most likely entity to be called ‘great’ in this vs. is Soma (cf., e.g., mahā́n samudráḥ in vs. 4, I think it likely that the form is nom. sg. In this sandhi position (before vowel) we would expect mahā́m̐(cf., e.g., IX.66.16 mahā́m̐asi), but I suggest that the anunāsika was redactionally changed to m because the form was reinterp. as a gen. pl. modifying immed. following ávīnām.
