This verse details various possible bad outcomes if they do not manage to secure his aid. As indicated in the publ. intro., I take the “eggs” (āṇḍā́) and “cups” (pā́trā) as slangy references to male and female genitalia, or in the latter case perhaps better ‘wombs’. I tr. -jānuṣāṇi loosely ‘contents’, but if the “cups” are wombs, then ‘progeny, offspring, brood’ would work.
