Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
5 verses: triṣṭubh
In this short hymn (four verses, without the refrain) we are given a tantalizing  glimpse of Indra’s infancy and what appears to be his youthful rivalry with and  outsmarting and overcoming of his father, here as sometimes elsewhere identified  with Tvaṣṭar; in these activities he is seemingly abetted by his mother. In this primal  scene she offers Indra soma just after his birth, and he, having drunk it, defeats his  father and steals the soma. Unfortunately this brief sketch is the fullest and clearest  expression of this mythological background. See also IV.18.
