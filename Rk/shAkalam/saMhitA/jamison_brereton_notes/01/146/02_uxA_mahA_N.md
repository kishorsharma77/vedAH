This verse seems to transition from narrow reference to the growth of the kindled fire at the kindling sticks to an enlarged frame involving Heaven and Earth. I take the dual ene in pāda a as referring still to the kindling sticks of vs. 1, but as Agni stands up in b, he reaches further -- putting his feet down on the back “of the broad one” (urvyā́ḥ), a clear reference to ‘earth’, and licking the udder, presumably of heaven -- thus filling the intermediate space between them.
