párśāna- occurs only 3x in the RV (and nowhere else in Skt.), here and in VIII.7.34, VIII.45.41. It has no good etymology (see EWA s.v.). The sense of ‘deep place, chasm’ is thus entirely dependent on context. Such a meaning is compatible with all three passages; the strongest support for it is VIII.7.34 giráyaś cin ní jihate párśānāso mányamānāḥ “Even the peaks bend down, thinking themselves depths.” Parallel locatives in VIII.45.41 make it likely that it refers to a place, but not what sort of place it might be: yád vīḷā́v indra yát sthire, yát párśāne párābhṛtam “What is in a firm place, what in a solid place, Indra, what has been borne away (in)to a párśāna ....” In our passage the ní ‘down’ does suggest that the destination is a depth, but I also think that this interpr. has been somewhat uncritically embraced by those with preconceptions about the Vedic hell/underworld.

nisvarám ‘in silence, to silence’ contrasts with svaryà- ‘reverberant’, used of the weapon in 4c.
