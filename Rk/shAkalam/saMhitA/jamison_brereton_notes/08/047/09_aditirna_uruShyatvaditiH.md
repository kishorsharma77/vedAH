Ge and Re take revátaḥ with Aryaman, not Mitra. It is true that the adj. is positioned between the two names and could in principle modify either one or both, but it belongs to the same pāda as mitrásya, and the following pāda containing aryamṇáḥ is a repeated pāda (=I.136.2e), in a verse where revánt- is not found. Since, further, revánt- is not a standard epithet of Aryaman, it seems wise to take it with Mitra.
