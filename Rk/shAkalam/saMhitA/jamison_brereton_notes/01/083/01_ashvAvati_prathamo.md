Most tr. take vícetas- as ‘perceptive’ vel sim. (Ge “die verständigen (?) Gewässer,” Re “les eaux discernantes”), but in this context it makes more sense to use the intransitive sense of the root √cit ‘be perceptible, appear’ rather than the I/T ‘perceive’; hence, with ví, ‘widely perceptible, conspicuous’. The point of the simile is surely that the goods with which Indra supplies the worshiper are abundant enough to be easily visible, like the sparkling waters filling a river. Note the case disharmony: logically the waters are compared not to Indra, but to the goods he bestows.
