Again the uncertainty about whether Indra will pay attention to their praise gives a slightly nervous air to the beginning of this verse. In the 2nd pāda the full form of ‘our’ (asmā́kam) is fronted; a tr. better reflecting this emphasis and in harmony with the poets’ anxieties about Indra’s attention would be “let it be our (soma-)drops that invigorate Indra…” Cf. 3cd.
