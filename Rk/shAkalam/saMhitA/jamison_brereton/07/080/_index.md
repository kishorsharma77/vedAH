Dawn
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: triṣṭubh
This very brief hymn, a mere three verses, sketches the main outlines of Dawn’s  activities, though it has no space to elaborate: her connection with poets and the  morning ritual, her task of revealing the visible world and banishing darkness, and  her connection with the distribution of goods.
