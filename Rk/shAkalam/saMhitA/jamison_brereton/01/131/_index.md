Indra
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
7 verses: atyaṣṭi
At the beginning of the first verse all cosmic forces conspire in giving Indra the first  rank, as a model for the similar honor and obeisance accorded him by men. But it  quickly becomes apparent (vss. 2–3) that Indra is also an object of contention and  competition among different groups of men, who all want him on their side. This con
tention is vividly depicted in verse 3. In verses 4–5 Indra’s own inclinations become  apparent: he aids priests and sacrificers and chastises those without sacrifice. In verse  6 we announce our own sacrifice to Indra, and thereby make a claim for his attention,  and in verse 7 we ask for further aid against our rivals and ill-wishers.
