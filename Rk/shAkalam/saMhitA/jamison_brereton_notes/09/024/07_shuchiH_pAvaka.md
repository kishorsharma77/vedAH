Because of the blurring of identity just discussed, I take the predicate of ucyate ‘is called’ to be sómaḥ, a re-assertion of the name of the god being celebrated in this hymn after the equation with Indra in vss. 4 and 6 (and with the cows in vs. 2). This re-assertion is esp.

appropriate in the final vs. of the hymn. Ge/Re take śúciḥ pāvakáḥ as the predicate instead, but this pair of adjectives already characterized the substance identically in 6c. I think the point is that “the gleaming and purified one” has the name / is called “Soma.” In favor of their interpr. is the variant in VIII.13.19 śúciḥ pāvaká ucyate só ádbhutaḥ (which also incorporates all 3 adjectives from our vs. 6c). In that passage the adjectives do seem to serve as predicate with ucyate, but with a twist -- these soma-epithets are applied to the praiser (stotár-) there. I therefore do not think that the two similar pādas need to be construed identically -- rather that one poet (probably the one responsible for VIII.13.19) is playing with the phrase.
