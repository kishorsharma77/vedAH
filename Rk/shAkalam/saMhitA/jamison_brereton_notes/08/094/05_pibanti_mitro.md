For the phrase tánā pūtásya, cf. I.3.4 tánā pūtā́saḥ, IX.16.8 tánā punānāḥ.

jā́vant- is a hapax and is surely a truncation of common prajā́vant-, likewise ‘possessing/granting offspring’, which occurs elsewhere in iambic cadences. In the IXth Maṇḍala Soma is asked on a number of occasions to bring or produce substances that are prajā́vant-, e.g. prajā́vad réta ā́bhara “bring here semen producing offspring.”
