With Ge (but not Re), I take the pres. part. sán as concessive, as the nom. forms of this participle generally are -- although I’m not sure what the concession is. The most likely possibility is that “sitting down on the womb” is an odd action for a horse. The most common simile with “sit” is “like a falcon,” e.g., IX.82.1 śyenó ná yónim … ā́sadam, with the same lexical material as here. Or perhaps horses don’t thunder.
