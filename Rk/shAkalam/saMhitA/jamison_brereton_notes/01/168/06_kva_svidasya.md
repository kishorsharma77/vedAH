Ge (/WG) take c with ab, with d independent, while Re configures the vs. as I do. There are no implications either way.

The publ. tr. doesn’t render the ā́‘here’ with the verb in the rel. cl. āyayá. The point is that they have arrived here despite the vastness of the space in which they were driving, but “in which you have driven here” doesn’t work in English.

The frame and the simile in c do not agree in number: sg. sáṃhitam, pl.

vithurā́-iva. The number difference has a semantic function; the entity that the Maruts are stirring is solid and a unity, hence hard to move, but they make it shake as if it were comprised of a number of small unconnected pieces that are easily set in motion. Although vithurá- is a deriv. of √vyath and does not contain the preverb ví, its initial syllable plays off the sám in sáṃhitam, in the common contrastive pairing sám ‘together’: ví ‘apart’. The real preverb ví opens the next pāda.

Ge (n. 6d) makes heavier weather of pāda d than seems necessary to me. I think the “turbulent flood” (tveṣám arṇavám) is simply the dusky realm (rájas-) of pāda a, i.e., the midspace in which the Maruts often find themselves. It is a turbulent flood because of the storms the Maruts are producing. The stone (ádri-) need not be a feature of the landscape (Fels, with Ge/WG), but a weapon of some kind, as often.
