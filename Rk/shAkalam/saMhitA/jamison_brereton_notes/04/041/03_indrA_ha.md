The orphaned tā́at the end of b is a bit surprising, somewhat reminiscent of the pāda-filling mechanisms engaged in by the epic bards, but not usually resorted to or needed by Rigvedic poets. This hymn is, however, not particularly topnotch work; compare Re’s comment “Banalisation des hymnes joints.” I am inclined to read yádī as *yád ī, even though the ī would not double an object (unless it is the unexpressed reflexive ‘themselves’) but would be pleonastic.

The reading would be to avoid yádī ‘if’. The standard tr. indeed all render as ‘when’, not ‘if’.
