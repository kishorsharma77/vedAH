Both Ge and Old suggest that ṛ́ghāvā should be read as neut. *ṛ́ghāvad on the basis of similar (but not identical) X.27.3 yadā́vā́khyat samáraṇam ṛ́ghāvad. This seems unnec., since nom. sg. ṛ́ghāvā makes fine sense, and, as anyone who has tangled with it knows, X.27 is a very strange hymn. The only factor in favor of the emendation is the fact that ṛ́ghāvā is the only representative of the -van-stem ṛ́ghāvan-; otherwise we find the -vant-stem ṛ́ghāvant- (3x). But -van- and -vantstems coexist elsewhere -- cf. maghávan(t)- -- and eliminating the -van-stem here doesn’t seem sufficient reason to make the emendation. (Note that WG do not follow Ge and Old, and Ge allows for the possibility of the nom. in his n. 8a.) Ge suggests that the subjects of a and b might be Indra’s wife. Scar (616 and n.

882) has her as the subj. of b but not a. After surveying the various possibilities in his n. he says, with remarkable understatement, “Das Dramolett lässt Raum für verschiedene Interpretationen.” I think it likely that Indra is the subj. of the first two pādas both because the word pátnī is only introduced in the 3rd pāda and because one wonders whether a woman would be in a position to survey the battlefield.

In d “whetted sharp by the soma pressers” (níśitaṃ somasúbhiḥ) continues the theme of the previous vss., that getting Indra on one’s side in battle requires plying him with soma at the sacrifice.
