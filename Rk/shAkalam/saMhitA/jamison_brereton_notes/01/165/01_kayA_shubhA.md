I’d be inclined to take samānyā́not as an adv. (‘altogether’) as in the publ. tr., but as a fem. instr. sg. forming part of the phrase káyā śubhā́, hence “with what joint/common beauty?” -- with the sense “what’s their joint insignia? how shall I recognize them?” Note that samāná- is differently formed from the two preceding phonologically similar adjectives sávayasaḥ sánīḷāḥ, which do match each other.

Note also following sám m... The adj. samāná- returns in 7b in a charged context.

JPB’s tr. cleverly reads étāsaḥ twice, once as the nom. pl. ‘antelopes’, once as the nom. pl. of the ppl. ā́-ita- ‘come here’.

In d śúṣṃam may be adverbial as JPB takes it (‘explosively’), but it may be a real obj. of árcanti (“chant their explosive power”). I’m inclined to follow the latter course, because śúṣma- must be a real noun in 4b. But in this case I interpr. it as an Inhaltsakk., further specifying the chant (*“chant their chant” à “chant their explosive force”) not the object of their praise as Ge, for example, does: “preisen den Kampfmut” (sim. WG).
