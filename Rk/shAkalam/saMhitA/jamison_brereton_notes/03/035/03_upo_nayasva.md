Medial nayasva is one of the relatively few middle forms to this pres. stem.

It is presumably used here because Indra is leading his own horses.

The crux in this vs. is the hapax cmpd. tapuṣpā́-. Gr glosses it ‘warmes trinkend’, perhaps referring to the gharma drink; in this he is tentatively fld by Mayrhofer (EWA s.v. tápuṣ-). But this -us-stem, tápus-, refers only to heat, generally menacing scorching heat, and in any case the horses shouldn’t be drinking the gharma drink (or probably any hot drink at all). The word is discussed by Scar (305-6), who offers several possible interpr. The interpr. is made more difficult by the uncertain grammatical identity of the form. It appears in sandhi as tapuṣpṓtém, is taken by the Pp. as tapuḥ’pā́, and is generally analyzed as a dual, modifying the bullish (horses) -- so Ge, Re, Scar, WG. However, Ge suggests in n. 3a that the form could represent irregular sandhi for tapuṣpā(ḥ) utá (that is, a double application of sandhi, first losing the final -s before vowel and then coalescing the vowels) and therefore be a nom. sg., modifying Indra. I have adopted this solution; it doesn't make much sense for the horses themselves to be doing the protecting, but Indra’s protective role would fit with the impv. ava ‘help’ in the next pāda.

In the last pāda Indra is urged to eat the roasted grains (addhi dhānā́ḥ). The same grains are prepared for the horses to eat in vs. 7: it seems somewhat surprising that Indra and his horses receive the same fodder, as it were -- though calling the horses Indra’s “comrades in joint revelry” in the next vs. (4b) suggests that they consume the offered meal together. I also don't understand why the grains should be “of the same appearance every day.” This phrase is essentially repeated in III.52.8, which also contains 5 occurrences of dhānā- (or deriv.). Perhaps the point is that we unfailingly make the same offering to Indra daily; he needn’t worry that we will substitute inferior food.
