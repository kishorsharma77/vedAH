The middle voice of tarete, fairly rare for forms of √tṝ, is responsible for my “move athwart each other,” against a more standard “hasten towards” or the like. It is also a reasonable representation of the movement of the kindling sticks rubbing against each other.

On √dhvaṃs see comm. ad IV.19.7.

Both sā́cya and kúpaya- are hapaxes, though the likely root affiliation of the former with √sac ‘accompany, attend upon’ makes its interpr. easier. With AiG II.2.793, 798, I take it to be a gerundive to this root. As for kúpaya-, I find it hard to separate it from the root √kup ‘quiver, quake’, despite the unclarity of its formation (suffix? accent?), and find the alternative analysis as ku-paya(s?)- (most recently, tentatively WG) unlikely.

várdhanam pitúḥ “the increaser of his father” is one of the RVic poet’s beloved paradoxes. The priest generates the ritual fire and is therefore its father, but the well-tended fire in turn produces prosperity and increase for the ritual officiants.
