With Ge (etc.), I take ná in pāda a as a simile marker, not a negative; the simile and frame participate in a pun on (-)ártha-. What they reached was a ni-àrtha- ‘failed goal’ (see, e.g., VI.27.6, X.107.8), which is like but tragically not their real goal. 6 In b note āśúś (canéd), which echoes paśúṣ (kavíḥ) in the previous vs. (8d) also pāda-initial. Here the sandhi is of course standard.

The adj. sutúka- occurs 7x in the RV; acdg. to EWA (s.v.) its meaning and etymology are unknown, though it is generally translated in the ‘quick, swift’ realm (like so many other unclear RVic adj.), e.g., Gr “rasch dahin eilend,” Ge (this passage) “spornstreichs fliehend.” On the basis of X.42.5, where it appears parallel to sváṣṭra- ‘easily goaded’, I suggest that it means ‘easily thrust/thrusting’ and is ultimately derived from √tuj ‘thrust’. Under this analysis, of course, the voiceless -kis a problem. Easiest would be to extract it from the unattested nom. sg. of the reasonably well-attested root noun túj-, which should be *túk, supported by pre-C forms like *tugbhís, *tukṣú. This is essentially a variant of Re’s (EVP XII.108) suggestion that it belongs to a root √tuc, a doublet of √tuj, but it avoids the awkwardness of positing this extra root to explain one stem. In fact, Re suggests in passing that it could start from an athematic nom. sg. *sutuk (he gives no accent), but he prefers the √tuc hypothesis.

In view of the disorderly rout of these forces described in the next vs., presumably due to the collapse of their alliance, I now wonder if amítrān refers not to their non-alliance with us (as in the publ. tr.), but to the lack or loss of unity among themselves.

In d Ge takes mā́nuṣe as a place name (“in Mānuṣa”), on the basis of JB III.244, which identifies it as the place of the Ten Kings battle. But, as Ge admits (n.

9d), the JB rendering could easily result from a misunderstanding of our passage.

Old suggests (not very enthusiastically) that it refers to (all) the enemies “in der Menschenwelt.” Schmidt’s interpr. is somewhat puzzling, putting it in an (unexpressed) simile contrasting the “castrates” of vádhri-vāc- to a (presumably virile) man expressed by mā́nuṣa-: “who were talking like castrates in the world of a man.” I think rather that it refers to Manu’s race or people: all other loc. singulars of this stem modify jáne (save for I.12.8.7, where it qualifies the semantically close vṛjáne). I take the expression as concessive “(though) in Manu’s (race)”: the point is that the opponents belong to the larger Ārya community though they are fighting against us. They therefore in principle share the same sacrificial practices, including ritual speech, but their ritual speech is ineffective (or so we hope), like that of a castrate. The extensive ritual references in the account of the battle only work under these conditions.

The cmpd. vádhri-vāc- ‘possessing gelded/castrated speech’ provides another parallel to the famous Indra-Vṛtra hymn I.32, whose vs. 7 likens Vṛtra to a vádhriwishing to become a bull.
