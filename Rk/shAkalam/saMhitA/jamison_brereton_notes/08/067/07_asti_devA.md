ádbhutainasaḥ is generally taken as a gen. sg., parallel to ánāgasaḥ in b.

But since the only other ex. of this stem modifies the Maruts in V.87.7, I think it likely that it is a nom. pl. modifying the Ādityas. Moreover there is no NOM + ásti construction in c as there are in a and b. There is perhaps too much machinery in the tr., to indicate that it is not the Ādityas’ offenses, but those of others, that cannot deceive or mislead them (=the gods), but given the Ādityas’ character, I think the internal structure of the cmpd would be clear to the audience.
