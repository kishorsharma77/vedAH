sū́re duhitā́“daughter of the Sun” preserves, by most accounts, the archaic sandhi of final -as > -e before initial dental. For further disc., see Jamison 2010 (Fs. Melchert). The myth on which this pāda is based, Sūryā’s marriage, is not otherwise mentioned in this hymn. On the formulaic representation of the myth in the RV see Jamison 2001 (Fs. Parpola).
