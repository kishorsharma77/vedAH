Ge and Re take náro as the nom. sg. of a thematic form of the ‘man’ stem, a nom. sg. that is otherwise not found in the RV (save possibly in svàrṇara-) and only very sparingly in the rest of Vedic (see AiG III.212). I follow Gr, Old, and WG in taking it as a gen. sg. of the athematic ‘man’ stem, even though the other two occurrences registered by Gr are better taken as nom. pl. It replaces expected *nur (cf. Aves. nərəš). It is parallel here to góḥ, and this gen. expression characterizes the type of dráviṇa- that Indra is providing as a prize. Since dráviṇa- is a derivative of √dru ‘run’, it really is ‘moveable wealth’, and both cattle and men would qualify.

The pair náro góḥ is echoed by the more conventional expression cátuṣpade … dvipā́de in 3d, which also contains the qualifier náryāya.

The opening ṛbhúr vā́jāya contains the names of two of the three Ṛbhus, though the words are not so used here.

As indicated in the publ. intro., the second hemistich is much discussed, and I will not treat other interpretations in detail. It depicts a buffalo (mahiṣá-) gazing after (and probably longing after) three females, or, in my interpr., one female in three different shapes. These shapes are three standard female roles, arranged chronologically: marriageable girl (according to my interpr. of vrā́- as ‘chooser’; see comm. VIII.2.6), wife/consort (ménā- < ‘exchange token’; see comm. I.62.7), and mother. The mahiṣá- is Indra, as often; this word also evokes the term for the chief wife of a king, máhiṣī-, thus indirectly adding another female role. I identify the female referent of all three as Dawn. Kakṣīvant calls Dawn “begetter of cows” (gávāṃ jánitrī) in nearby I.124.5, like our mātáraṃ góḥ, and also compares her to a vrā́- in I.124.8. Since Dawn is always depicted in motion, “gaze after (a retreating figure)” is an appropriate verb. (Cf. IV.18.3 where Indra anu √cakṣ his mother who is going away: parāyatī́m mātáram ánv acaṣṭa.) If the referent is Dawn, then the horse whose consort she is is probably the sun. For Dawn and the horse = sun, see VII.77.3.

The term svajā́- ‘self-created’ has two applications in the passage. On the one hand, it characterizes the vrā́- particularly. Since she is a ‘chooser’, the female protagonist of a svayaṃvara (self-choice) marriage, she is ‘self-created’ because she is not being given to someone by someone else, but is doing it herself. If marriage is the equivalent of upanayana and second birth for women, then she’s her own parent.

On the other hand, it can characterize all the role transformations she undergoes in cd, loosely “(re)creating herself as …” For further on vrā́- and this passage in general, see Jamison 2003 (Fs. H.-P. Schmidt) pp. 45-47, also X.111.3.
