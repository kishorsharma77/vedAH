The verb in b, abhy ámanta, is accented; though there is no overt subordinator, I take pāda b as a purpose clause dependent on pāda a. That the obj. of yuyodhi in a, ámīvā(ḥ) ‘afflictions’, forms an etymological figure with the verb in b supports a close relationship between the pādas. ámanta is best taken as a subjunctive, to the seṭ root pres. amīti and as an -anta replacement for act. *-an of the usual type in this otherwise act. verbal system (Jamison IIJ 21 [1979] 150). This avoids imposing an interpr. as a reciprocal middle, as noted as an alternative by WG with ref. to Hoffmann and Dunkel, although the WG tr. does not reflect it.

The 2nd hemistich lacks a verb. I supply kaḥ; the idiom púnar √kṛ ‘make new, renew’ is fairly common (see Gr., s.v. púnar, 2), and see also Agastya’s I.174.7 kṣā́m … kaḥ, with the same object as here though with a very different sense. The publ. tr.

should signal the lack of verb by a device like “Re(new) …” or “(Make) new …”
