The standard tr. of (ā́) vacyasva (√vañc) here is ‘gallop’ (Ge, Re), but the root itself means something like ‘move crookedly’ (see comm. ad III.39.1 inter alia). Kulikov (Vedic - ya-presents) devotes considerable space to this -yá-pres. (218-24), rather desperately attempting to account for its apparent passive accentuation (vacyáte). He concludes that the subject of this pres. “always refers to beings set in motion and directed by someone else, not moving on its [sic] own,” and was originally the passive counterpart of a posited transitive redupl. pres. **vívaṅkti [double star is Kulikov’s]. I find this over-elaborate -- and since the subjects are generally horses, or entities configured as horses, and since RVic horses have considerable agency of their own with regard to movement -- not terribly convincing. In this particular case, the verb is in the imperative, and it is difficult to see how something incapable of moving on its own could be commanded to do so. Four of the ten occurrences of this pres. stem are imperatival, three of them 2nd sg. as here. (the fourth is 3rd pl.). As discussed ad III.39.1, etc., I consider one of the nuances of this verb to be ‘coil, twist’, and here I see the soma circling and twisting its way into the cup; the preverb pári ‘around’ is a regular part of the description of soma’s movements around the filter and into the vessels.

I take the injunc. sadaḥ in the sense of an impv.; see KH (Injunk. 263) for this usage of this particular form.

On the sa-aor. ádhukṣa-, here in 3rd sg. mid. adhukṣata, see Narten (Sig.Aor. 143- 44).
