párṣi … partṛ́bhiḥ “deliver to the further shore with deliverers” both continues the ‘ford’ motif of the last vs. and picks up the same verb in 5b, where it has more restricted semantics.

Pādas b and c contain two different forms of √yu ‘keep away’: the negated adj. áprayutvan- lit. ‘not distant / absent, not inattentive’ and the impv. yuyodhi.

Note the chiastic figure héḷāṁsi daívyā ... [á]devāni hvárāṁsi ca. The inner terms, daívyā … ádevāni, are of course etymologically related, but, though both neut.

pl. a-stems, have different endings; the outer terms, héḷāṁsi … hvárāṁsi are paired only by their initial h- and their neut. pl. s-stem ending -āṃsi. The ca is of course misplaced: we would expect *ádevāni ca hvárāṁsi. Klein (DGRV I.53) says that ádevāni hvárāṁsi “is treated as an indivisible unit, and ca is therefore displaced to third position,” but this is a description, not an explanation. I would suggest that the poet didn’t want to interrupt his pretty chiasmus. (The placement of ca also enables an iambic finish to the pāda, whereas the expected order would not, but I doubt if this is the major reason.)
