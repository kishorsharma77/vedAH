Although Ge declines to tr. mākī́, the interpretation of this word as a -kasuffixed form of the 1st ps. possessive pronoun, accepted by Old (see also Scar 519), not only fits the context but would exemplify the tendency to use -ka-suffixed forms in slangy, low-register contexts such as dānastutis. For disc. see Jamison 2009, also 2008.
