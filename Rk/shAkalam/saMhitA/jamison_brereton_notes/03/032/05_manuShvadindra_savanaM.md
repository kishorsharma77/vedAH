The rendering of vavṛtsva in the publ. tr. (“let yourself be turned hither”), a sort of passive reflexive, now seems over-elaborate to me; I would substitute “be turned.” The other examples of this mid. pf. impv. seem more straightforwardly simply “turn” or “turn yourself,” but if yajñaíḥ has true instrumental force, a passive rendering is more natural. Possible, however, is Re’s “grâce à (nos) sacrifices.” The referent of saraṇyúbhiḥ is not totally clear. Sāy. (fld. by Re) suggests the Maruts, while Ge adds horses or waves as possibilities. The other ex. of a plural to this stem (also instr.) in I.62.4 is in a clear Vala context, with the Navagvas and Daśagvas in the same vs., which would suggest the Aṅgirases -- but, although the Vala myth and the Aṅgirases were prominent in the preceding hymn III.31, they are not found in this hymn, which is dominated by the Maruts and which mentions only the Vṛtra myth (here and in the following vs.). I therefore think it likely that Sāy. was correct. Note that saraṇyú- … sisarṣi is an etym. figure, continued by sártavaí in the next vs. (6b).

The rendering of the phrase apó árṇā as “the flooding waters” in the publ tr.

assumes an emendation to fem. pl. árṇāḥ, with Gr and numerous others (see Old), contra the Pp and not reflecting the expected sandhi of such a form, which should be árṇāḥ. As Old points out, the emendation is not nec.: árṇā could easily be a neut. pl.

to the thematic stem árṇa-. In this case the tr. would better read “the waters, the floods.”
