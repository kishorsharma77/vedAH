Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The context of this hymn is the morning ritual, and its aim is to attract Indra to it  by our invocation, which is the subject of the first two verses. In verse 1 Agni seems  to carry the invocation heavenward; in the second the invocation turns Indra here.  The strength Indra will derive from both praise and sacrifice occupy the next two  verses (3–4), and the final verse summarizes our attempts to attract him and the  benefits he will provide us.  
Especially in the first two verses the poet is coy about reference, and the audience  must guess the subjects of the verbs and the referents of the pronouns until the last  pāda of verse 2.
