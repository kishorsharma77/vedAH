Agni  
Sutambhara Ātreya  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
Like the previous hymn, which is also attributed to Sutambhara, this hymn empha sizes the praise song offered to Agni, which causes Agni to grow and to perform  the sacrifice as the Hotar. The course of the hymn follows that growth of Agni. In  verse 1 the sacrificers are just beginning to kindle Agni. He then spreads wide (vs.  4) and is made strong (vs. 5), until finally, in the last verse, he encompasses the gods.
