Note #sthā́tāraḥ … sthana#.

This vs. reprises some of what came before. The focus on śávas- earlier in the hymn (1e, 2cde) is emphatically revived with ab … vṛddhaśavasaḥ … śávaḥ; the hapax epithet suśukvan- in the nom. pl.. suśúkvānaḥ in 3b is cleverly echoed by the pf. part. śuśukvā́ṃsaḥ, where the redupl. śu- matches the prefix su-; and the simile in 3d agnáyo ná svávidyutaḥ appears in reverse order (and a different shared quality) in śuśukvā́ṃso ná-agnáyaḥ. There is also a local repetition of tveṣá- in 6b, echoing the same stem in the same position in 5b.
