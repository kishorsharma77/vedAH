The participial phrase bíbhrad vájram here and in VI.23.1 below may be intended to invoke the name bharád-vāja-, the poet of this hymn and indeed of this maṇḍala, by an expression that seems the syntactic equivalent of that type of governing compound — with the prior member belonging to the same root and the 2nd member a phonological variant of the obj. Matching the first member exactly would be problematic, since the nom. sg. of the participle would be bháran. The punning on PNs noted with regard to the immediately preceding vs. may be in evidence here as well.n
