With Ge and Re I (reluctantly) supply imperative ‘give’ in ab. It is barely possibly (but I think unlikely) that ukṣatam in c is a pun, belonging to √ukṣ ‘sprinkle’ in c, but √vakṣ/ukṣ ‘increase’ in ab, with the meaning “increase good wisdom for the pious man.” (Kiehnle 1979: 152 takes it to ‘increase’ in the whole vs.) Unfortunately there are no certain exx. of the act. suffix-accented stem ukṣáti to √vakṣ ‘increase’ (though see med. part. ukṣámāṇa- and isolated root-accented part. úkṣant-), and even if so, we would probably expect them to be intrans., at least on the basis of pf.

vavákṣa, etc., and the just cited pres. forms.

The hapax ávitāriṇī- is clearly derived from ví √tṝ, but its meaning is variously rendered. Gr (Sāy) ‘enduring, lasting’, Ge “die nicht auf sich warten lässt” (doesn’t keep (s.o.) waiting), on the basis of X.34.6. However, I take that passage in the Gambler hymn to mean ‘run counter’ (adopting the tr. of Macdonell), or more pointedly ‘doublecross’, the tr. I use here, though something like ‘thwart’ would convey the sense of this idiom as well.
