The first pāda, supravācanáṃ táva vīra vīryàm, is a nominalization of the famous opening of I.32 (found in various forms elsewhere): índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi prá vocam. In that hymn this opening is followed by the account of an undoubted heroic deed, the slaying of Vṛtra. Here the specification in b, introduced by yád (as often in such proclamations) followed by a promisingly heroic ékena krátunā “by your resolve alone,” turns out to be something of an anticlimax: you find goods. This lack of drama is somewhat repaired by d, which sketches a larger world of great deeds.

Unfortunately, however, the syntax of d is disturbing. The rel. cl. of d is universally tr. (incl. by JPB) “all the things you have done,” but “all” (víśvā) is not part of the rel. cl. (yā́cakártha). It has instead been stuck in the refrain, which only in this verse has been altered from sā́si ukthyàḥ (2-10d, 12d) to séndra víśvāsi ukthyàḥ.

Dropping a piece of a rel. cl. into the middle of a main cl. is simply impossible in the RV. It is possible to interpr. víśvā as a real part of the main cl., an acc. of respect: “What (deeds) you have done, you are worthy of hymns with regard to all of them.” But somehow I doubt that’s what the poet intended -- though what his intentions were, esp. given the deliberate alteration of the refrain, are opaque to me.

Another possible wrinkle in d is that yā́need not be the neut. pl. of the rel., illegally anticipating the víśvā intruding in the refrain. It could be an instr. sg. picking up váyaḥ in the preceding pāda: “… the vigor by which you have done …”
