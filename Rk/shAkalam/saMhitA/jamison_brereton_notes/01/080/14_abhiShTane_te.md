The phrase yát sthā́jágac ca is curiously formed, though the meaning is clear. Because the verb rejate is unaccented, the yád cannot mark a “real” subordinate clause. I wonder if it does not involve the imposition of an “X and which Y” construction on an indivisible merism. In other words, with an “X and which Y” we might expect *sthā yác ca jágat “the still and what is moving”; cf. X.88.4 (also adduced by Ge) sthā́jágad yád with a similarly pleonastic and apparently misplaced yád. But sthā́jágat is a fixed expression and nothing can be inserted into it.

Note the repetition of cit táva manyáve from 11a, again with a verb of trembling (vépete 11b, vevijyáte 14d) and an instr. of fear (bhiyásā 11b, bhiyā́14d).
