Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
The most notable feature in this hymn is the theme of “attachment,” which is played  with semantically and syntactically in verses 2–4. In verse 2 it is Indra’s own powers  that are attached to him, or rather to his hand (see also the mace in hand in vs. 1),  but in the following two verses ritual elements offered by men are the attachments.  Since the final verse (6) is a summary verse, introduced as often by evā́ “in this way,”  verses 2–4 constitute an omphalos defined by the attachment theme. Interestingly,  the only one of Indra’s great deeds mentioned in this hymn is his forceful separation of heaven and earth (vs. 5b), which provides a conceptual opposite to the attach  
ment elsewhere.  
The larger concern of the hymn is the reciprocal relation between men, who offer  Indra sacrifice and praise poetry, and Indra, who places his power in the service of  men and offers them gifts. This relationship is announced in the first verse, espe cially in the word “partnership, comradeship” in the first pāda, and is also conveyed  iconically by the “attachment” of the words “Indra” and “men,” which occur next  to each other initial in the opening pāda of the hymn, and again in 4c (índraṃ [vo]  náraḥ). The relationship between the god and his worshipers is here modeled on  that between the poet-sacrificer and his patron. Indra is in fact called a “patron” in  verse 5 and described as providing the priestly gift (dakṣiṇā) in verse 3, which is the  task and prerogative of a patron.814 VI.30
