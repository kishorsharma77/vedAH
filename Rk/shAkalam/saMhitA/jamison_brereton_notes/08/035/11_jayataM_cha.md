The distribution of ca’s in pāda a is somewhat puzzling or, perhaps, syncopated, with the 2nd ca following preverb+verb (prá stutaṃ ca), though the other two preverb/verb combinations in this tṛca place the ca in the expected position after the preverb (ā́ca gachatam 10a and immediately following prá cāvatam 11a). This does not seem to be metri causa, or at least not in some obvious way.
