Mitra and Varuṇa  
Urucakri Ātreya  
4 verses: triṣṭubh  
In the last half of the hymn the poet connects Mitra and Varuṇa to their mother  Aditi, the goddess who embodies guiltlessness. He invokes her for wealth, a con tinuing lineage, good fortune, and health (vs. 3). It is not clear, however, whether  it is she whom the poet invokes in 3d or whether it is the two gods. The object is  suppressed perhaps to create intentional ambiguity, since the gift that comes from  guiltlessness is also the gift from Mitra and Varuṇa. The connection between Aditi,  Mitra, and Varuṇa is confirmed in the last verse, which call them Ādityas, “sons of  Aditi.”
