Mitra and Varuṇa
Urucakri Ātreya
4 verses: triṣṭubh
In the last half of the hymn the poet connects Mitra and Varuṇa to their mother  Aditi, the goddess who embodies guiltlessness. He invokes her for wealth, a con tinuing lineage, good fortune, and health (vs. 3). It is not clear, however, whether  it is she whom the poet invokes in 3d or whether it is the two gods. The object is  suppressed perhaps to create intentional ambiguity, since the gift that comes from  guiltlessness is also the gift from Mitra and Varuṇa. The connection between Aditi,  Mitra, and Varuṇa is confirmed in the last verse, which call them Ādityas, “sons of  Aditi.”
## 1
The three realms of light and the three heavens, the three airy spaces do  you two uphold, o Varuṇa and Mitra,
strengthening the emblem of your lordship, protecting your unaging  commandment.
## 2
O Varuṇa and Mitra, your milk-cows are filled with refreshments. Your  rivers give honey-rich milk.
Three brilliant bulls [=fires?] stand far and wide, the semen-givers of the  three holy places.
## 3
In the early morning, at midday, and at the rising of the sun, again and  again I call upon the goddess Aditi
for wealth in its entirety, o Mitra and Varuṇa. I invoke (her) for kith and  kin, for luck and life.
752 V.70–71

(You) two heavenly Ādityas, who are the upholders of the earthly space  and the realm of light—
o Mitra and Varuṇa, the immortal gods do not violate your enduring  commandments.
