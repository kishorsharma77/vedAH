Ge and Re (also Ober II.43) construe táva with rétasaḥ (e.g., Ge “Von deinem himmlischen Samen sind diese Geschöpfe”). I am reluctant to do so because of the parallelism of távemā́ḥ (/ túbhyemā́ḥ) just noted: all three expressions should be rendered in the same general way. In addition Ge’s tr. essentially assumes rétasaḥ is abl., but its companion adj. divyásya is stubbornly gen. I would therefore stick to my tr., though slightly modified for clarity to “Yours are these offspring of (your) heavenly semen.” For … víśvasya bhúvanasya rājasi, see 5d, which is identical, and 36d … víśvasya bhúvanasya rājáse, in an acc. + inf. phrase.

Pāda c is essentially a restatement of b.

Since dhāma-dhā́- is an etymological figure, I have rendered it as one, rather than ‘establisher of domains’, vel sim.
