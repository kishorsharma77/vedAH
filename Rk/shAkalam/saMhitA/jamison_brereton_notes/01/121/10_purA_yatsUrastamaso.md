The sequence of tense/mood in this verse is somewhat puzzling, with an impv. in the first hemistich (asya, pāda b) followed by a 2nd sg. impf. (ā́-adar, so Pp.) or injunctive (ā́-dar, so Hoffmann, Inj. 191). This discrepancy must be why Ge puts the first hemistich in quotation marks, though he doesn’t explain who is speaking.

In my opinion the first hemistich concerns the Vala myth: the word phaligá- ‘bolt’ is associated with the Vala myth in two of its three other occurrences (I.62.4, IV.50.5), once of the Vṛtra myth (VIII.32.25), never of Śuṣṇa. However, if this is the Vala myth it is somewhat puzzling why the sun is entering the dark, since the Vala myth is usually set at dawn. Perhaps this refers to a version in which the sun is also trapped in the Vala cave.

I supply ‘fold’ in the temporal abl. expression in pāda a, since I would expect an acc. of goal, and pā́thas- ‘fold’ is common with ápi √i (I.162.2, II.3.9, III.8.9, VII.47.3). On the other hand, perhaps the abl.(/gen.) támasaḥ is simply by attraction to the abl. infinitive ápīteḥ.

As noted earlier, ā́daḥ is analyzed by Hoffmann as an injunctive in mythological context. Note also that it probably belongs to √dṛ ‘tear’, not √dā, despite ā́do to the latter root in 8a. However, it could technically be underlyingly identical to ā́do, and that pāda also contains a diváḥ. In that case it would mean “you took …”
