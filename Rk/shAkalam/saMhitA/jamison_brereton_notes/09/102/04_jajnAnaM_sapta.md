The “seven mothers” (saptá mātáraḥ) are presumably the rivers (contra Ge n. 4ab, who prefers dhītí- or ‘sisters’), which we also met in vs. 1 as the “great (fem.) ones.” Their appearance here strengthens the likelihood that mahī́nām in 1a is dependent on śíśuḥ; see comm. there.

On vedhā́m instead of expected vedhásam see comm. ad IX.26.3.

The other two occurrences of śriyé in IX (IX.94.4, 104.1) are associated with birth/child: IX.94.4 śriyé jātáḥ and, in the next hymn, IX.104.1 śíśuṃ ná ... śriyé. I therefore construe jajñānám … śriyé together, despite their polarized positions at the two ends of the hemistich.

As Ge points out (n. 4c), dhruvá- can modify rayí- (IV.2.7 and, in this maṇḍala, IX.20.4). I therefore think dhruvó rayīṇā́m is abbreviated from dhruvó

*rayír rayīṇā́m. Unfortunately in Engl. “enduring wealth of wealths” is too awkward
to be parsable, hence my “(treasure) of treasures.” Even more unfortunately the switch in the Engl. obscures the relationship of this vs. to the preceding one. In the context of this vs. the imperative clause “rouse wealth!” (érayā rayím) in 3b can be reinterp. as tantamount to “rouse Soma!” since Soma here is identified as rayí-, in fact the best rayí-.

The 4-syl. addendum pāda is a self-contained subordinate clause, cikéta yát, as is the identically structured juṣánta yát in the next vs. (5d). The poet uses the unusual metrical pattern to his advantage in this hymn. Both Ge and Re think that ‘wealth’ is the understood complement of cikéta, and this would find some support in VII.95.2 rāyáś cétantī “taking note of wealth.” However, as just disc., I consider rayīṇā́m in c as part of a phrase describing Soma. Moreover, as Ge points out (n.

4ab), cíketa responds to aśāsata ‘they instructed’ in b, and I therefore think that the point is that Soma paid attention to his mothers’ instruction.
