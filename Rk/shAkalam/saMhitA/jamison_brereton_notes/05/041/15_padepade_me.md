The action in pāda a is a positive one: the speaker is assured to make it to old age. See 17de and disc. there, as well as X.59.4, which will be disc. further below.

The construction in b, which expresses the agent of ní dhāyi, is complex. Its underlying model is the “X and which Y” construction, but it is inverted, with the rel.

cl. member first: “(by her) who is … and by the protectors.” Moreover, it contains both vā and ca. As Klein says (II.174-75), “the construction should most likely be viewed as a conjunctive anacoluthon in which the poet begins by intending alternative conjunction and finishes with an additive sequence. Within each member the conjunction occupies its normal enclitic position: (várūtrī vā śakrā yā́) (pāyúbhiś ca).” On ṛjuvániḥ see Scar 467-68. Note that this form produces a bad cadence.
