Re tr. pāda a “Que cet (acte) de Pavamāna se réalise donc ...” I would prefer this rendering of satyám to the “true” of Ge and the publ. tr., but it is even harder to square with the augmented impf. akṛṇot (c) (and probably prā́vat in d, since √av has no injunctives) that expresses the content of the satyám (“true” is bad enough).

Perhaps the poet is suggesting that some have expressed doubt that Soma accomplished the deeds described in cd, even though kārú-s are agreed that he did, and that he (our poet) wants them to be true. This covert skepticism might well be justified, since all the deeds in cd are attributed elsewhere to other gods. On the other hand, see nearby IX.94.5, where Soma is urged to “make broad light” (urú jyótiḥ kṛṇuhi).

Another word for poet or the equivalent, kārú- ‘bard’, is added to the trio in vs. 2.

I do not know if we should see a difference in nuance between the augmented impf. ákṛṇot in c and the injunc. aor. kar in d; the latter is in the same clause as the (probably augmented) impf. prā́vat.

The stem abhī́ka- ‘close quarters, face-to-face’ is elsewhere used in contrast to ‘wide(ness)’, VII.85.1 … uruṣyatām abhī́ke, X.133.1 abhī́ke cid ulokakṛ́t, and this contrast is evident here as well, with the positive ákṛṇod ulokám ending c, and the negative kar abhī́kam in d.

As Old points out, kar would be better as a heavy syllable; he suggests underlying *karr (< *kar-t). See comm. ad VII.75.1.
