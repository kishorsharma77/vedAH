Both the pres. and the aor. stems of √pā ‘drink’ occur here, as in III.35.10.

The situation is in fact even a bit more complex: as in III.35.10 both stems deploy imperatives here, píba opening pāda a, pāhi in d, but the latter is also in a complex diptych with the impf. ápibaḥ (“just as you drank [ápibaḥ] …, so [take a] drink [pāhi] today …”). As in III.35.10 I have translated as if there is still an aspectual difference between the two stems, but I am not certain this is the case.
