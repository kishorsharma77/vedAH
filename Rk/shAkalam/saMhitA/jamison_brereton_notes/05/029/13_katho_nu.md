Gr, Ge (/WG), and Klein (DGRV I.219) interp. pári √car as ‘serve’.

Although this sense is found in later Vedic, the RVic instances of this lexeme only have the literal meaning ‘go around’ (e.g., III.7.2) with the developed sense ‘encompass’. (I.127.9 comes closest to ‘serve’, but the ‘surround’ sense is dominant.) Interpreting pári carāṇi here as ‘serve’ requires the part. vidvā́n to take an obj.

(“knowing your heroic deeds …”), but pāda-final vidvā́n is almost always used absolutely. Moreover áparītaḥ (pári √i) in the next vs. continues the thought of conceptual circumscription. Ge (/WG) and Klein divide the vs. syntactically into ab / cd, with the rel. cl. of c expressing the obj. of d. By contrast I think the lexical parallelism and the conjunction co [=ca u] of … yā́cakártha / yā́co … kṛṇávaḥ of bc mark those relative clauses as tightly conjoined, and I take them as subordinate to pāda a. Further, the last pāda préd u tā́te vidátheṣu bravāma strikes me as a self-contained (pseudo- )refrain, reminiscent of the Gṛtsamāda refrain in II: bṛhád vadema vidáthe suvī́rāḥ (II.1.16d etc.).
