The one who sends the sacrifice to its goal along the path of truth: we  make him our familiar with reverence accompanied by oblations—in  the conclave of gods (with reverence) accompanied by oblations.  
Because of our presentation of nourishments he does not waste away  with this body,  
he whom Mātariśvan (brought) to Manu from afar—the god he brought  from afar.
