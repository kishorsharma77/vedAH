As Ge points out (n. 3cd), the acc. śátrūn must be read as the obj. of both similes and acc. támaḥ ‘darkness’ as the obj. of both frames, though the former only appears in c and the latter in d. The two similes compare Dawn not only to a male figure, but to a skillful, highly trained male warrior: archer and chariot-driver.

In c the simile marker iva occurs after the 2nd term, not the 1st (might expect

*śū́ra ivā́stā śátrūn). Perhaps śū́ra- ástar- is perceived as a unity, “champion archer”;
cf. I.70.11 ásteva śū́raḥ, IV.36.6 śū́ro ástā, I.8.4 śū́rebhir ástṛbhiḥ, and, with lexical substitution, II.42.2 vīró ástā. There is also the fact that in similes with three terms matching two different cases, there’s some fluctuation in the position of the simile marker.
