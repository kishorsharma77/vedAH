The syntax of the 1st hemistich is intricate and hard to parse. The first rel. cl.

(… yásya …) extends through ékasya śruṣṭaú, with yásya coreferential with ékasya.

This clause is in turn dependent on the short yád clause yád dha codám ā́vitha, with codám the referent of yásya. The standard tr. take codá- as a personal name, but this is not necessary, as Mayrhofer (PN s.v.) points out -- and in fact it would be better not to have another name for Dabhīti (c), who is the ultimate referent of both yásya (a) and codám (b).

Note that ā́diya(ḥ) at the end of b matches āsíyam at end of 8c.
