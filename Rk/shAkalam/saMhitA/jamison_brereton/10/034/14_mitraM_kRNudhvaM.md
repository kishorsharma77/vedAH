[To all the dice:] Make alliance (with us) now; have pity on us. Do not  conjure against us boldly with your terrible (mind/eye).
Let your battle fury now settle down, your hostility. Let another now be  in the toils of the brown ones.
The next four hymns (35–38) form a group, though they are not all attributed to the  same author (see Oldenberg 1888: 229 n. 2, 235). The first two, to the All Gods, are  attributed to Luśa Dhānāka, while the other two were given fanciful poets’ names  derived from the contents of the hymn itself:  37 Abhitapas Saurya (“Scorching  Heat, son of the Sun”) and 38 Indra Muṣkavant (“Indra, possessing testicles”).
