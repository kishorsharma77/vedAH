For īkṣáyat see Jamison 1983: 123. It has the same double I/T value I also ascribe to citáyanta(ḥ) in I.131.2f.

In de I take bā́dhe as an infinitive with tásmai [=Indra] as subj. and ā́yuḥ prajā́vat as obj. This requires √bādh to have a positive value (‘thrust [s.th. good] towards [s.o.]’), rather than the usual negative ‘thrust away, repel’, but see I.61.2 for a similar positive sense.
