In III.51.4 I take sám √hā as ‘compact oneself together’, that is, ‘concentrate one’s essence’, and that seems the image here, of the embryonic Vasiṣṭha taking shape from concentrated lightning. Ge (n. 10a) suggests rather that it refers to semen suddenly poured out. I do not see this, and his suggested parallel in X.95.10 seems irrelevant, esp. since the lightning there is Urvaśī.

Old’s argument that vs. 10 depicts one birth and the following vss. another depends in part on taking the two utá’s of 10c and 11a as marking the two births.

This would be more convincing if the first utá were not in the middle of the pāda.

This position seems better accounted for by assuming that 10c refers to both births, with utá conjoining tát te jánma and ékam, as Ge takes it (“das war deine (eine) Geburt and eine …”). So also Klein (DGRV I.368). The double yád in b and d support this interpr., with each yád introducing one of the births. I follow this general interpr.

The yád in b is very deep in its clause, with both subj. and obj. preceding it, if pādas ab form a single clause as in the standard tr. (incl. Ge and the publ. tr.). It 40 would, however, be possible to take pāda a as the main clause on which b is dependent: “light was compacting out of lightning when M+V looked upon you.” This would solve the problem, but the unusual position of yád could also be attributed to an attempt to make b and d parallel, each recounting one of the births and opening with the putative father (or fathers) followed by yád, with a preterital verb and the obj. tvā (the latter in different orders): b mitrā́váruṇā yád ápaśyatāṃ tvā and d agástyo yát tvā viśá ājabhā́ra. In this scenario, pāda a, which is a single NP, would have been fronted around the core clause.

With Old (fld. by Ge), I read dat. viśé contra Pp. viśáḥ. The clan in question is supposed to be the Tṛtsus.
