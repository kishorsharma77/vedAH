As pointed out in the publ. intro., pādas ab contain a pun -- which Ge fails to note and Re mentions in his n. but fails to render in his translation. Agni “knows the races” (jātā́… veda) of gods and men. Those two words in that order produce his common epithet Jātavedas. I take apīcyàm ‘hidden, secret’ at the end of b as a separate clause, alluding to this pun: “(this is his) secret (name).” (The publ. tr.

should have “name” in parentheses.) apīcyàm (-āni) almost always qualifies ‘name’, including two hymns later by the same poet (VIII.41.5 … apīcyā̀/ véda nā́māni gúhyā). Both Ge and Re instead take apīcyàm as a separate object of veda, construed with márt(i y)ānām, while jātā́is limited only by devā́nām (“knows the races of the gods and the secret [/Re ‘specificity’] of mortals”), though gods and mortals are frequently a merism. My view that apīcyàm is a separate clause is supported by the meter. Mahāpaṅkti consists only of 8-syllable pādas, and 6b should end after márt(i y)ānām. In fact, Old in his Prol. suggested deleting the following apīcyàm, but in the Noten thinks better of it, allowing a 4-syllable pendant to this line. This pendant is, in my interpr., syntactically independent and a sort of meta-comment.

In e Ge supplies ghee with návīyasā: “mit erneutem (Opferschmalz).” This of course is more semantically harmonious with svā̀hutaḥ ‘bepoured’, but betrays a sad lack of poetic sensibility. The stem návīyas- is regularly used of verbal products, and it narrowly echoes návyasā vácaḥ of 2a. Moreover, 3ab contains an example of the trope “pour prayers” (there explicitly compared to ghee: mánmāni … ghṛtáṃ ná juhve). This expression svā̀huto návīyasā economically combines the “newer speech” of 2 and the “pouring prayers” of 3, using both √hu (from 3) and náv(ī)yas- (from 2).

The poet could hardly have made his metaphorical intent clearer. (Re is only a bit less flat-footed than Ge; he gives návīyasā the correct referent [hymne], but still sneaks in a supplied beurre fondu to construe with svā̀hutaḥ.)
