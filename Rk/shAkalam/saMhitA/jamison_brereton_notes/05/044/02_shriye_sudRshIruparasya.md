[in this VD seq] and V.63.1, the only attestations in the family books. The putative first member sacca here is then provided with an alternative Sanskritic analysis, sác [i.e., sȧt] ca -- I’m not suggesting an emendation here, but a word play.

The second ca connects the underlying bahuvrīhi to the noun it modifies, havíḥ, hence an underlying sequence havíḥ … *saccá-dhātu ca. I further suggest that this word play is actualized in a different word in the first word of the pāda, átyam, which rhymes with satyá- (save for accent).

As just noted, pāda b participates in a number of phonetic plays: -gātuḥ echoes dhā́tu in pāda; sá hó(tā) anticipates immediately following saho(bháriḥ), and

-bháriḥ is a scrambling of barhír in the next pāda. This last is particularly worth
noting because -bhári- is a Vedic hapax (Whitney, Rts., lists it as RV.C., and its only RV occurrence is here) of somewhat unusual formation (see AiG II.2.295). It is clearly a contextually inspired nonce here and should be given no weight in considering i-stem morphology.

The last lexical problem in the vs. is visrúhā in d, otherwise found only in VI.7.6. Gr glosses ‘Strom’ and connects it with √sru ‘flow’, which is phonologically impossible (where would the -h come from?). Ge tr. ‘Arm’, which is just a contextually inspired rendering, as far as I can see. Re tr. ‘flamme’ (fld. by Kellens, Noms rac. 82-83), though ad VI.7.6 (EVP XIII.127-28) he floats (only to reject) the possibility that it is a variant of vīrúdh- (‘sprout, shoot, growth’) on the basis of the similarity between VI.7.6 and II.35.8, which contains a form of vīrúdh-. This suggestion fits with Sāy.’s gloss oṣadhi- ‘plant’ (for this passage; in VI.7.6 Sāy. glosses the pl. visruhaḥ as nadyaś ca gaṅgādyāḥ “rivers, Gaṅgā, etc.’). The word has received the most attention from Scar, first in his Root noun book (464-65) and then in the n. to V.44.3 in WG (in which Scar is responsible for Maṇḍala V). In the former Scar pronounces visrúh- “ganz unklar,” echoed by the somewhat less pessimistic “unklar” in WG, where he tr. “Reisig und Zweigen” and suggests it’s derived from *vi-sr-u- ‘sich weit erstreckend’, contaminated with -rúdh-, -rúh-, with the result reminiscent of vīrúdh-. I also believe that the word is in the semantic realm of plant growth and that it should be connected with √ru(d)h ‘grow’; this is esp. clear in VI.7.6, which contains a verbal form of that root: vayā́iva ruruhuḥ saptá visrúhaḥ.

However, I do not think that √sru or √sṛ needs to be brought in, at least directly.

Instead I attribute the extraneous -s- to a sort of analogical backformation involving the preverbs ví, ní, and nís, starting from the form vīrúdh- cited above. Although the lengthening of the preverb ví in that form results from the initial laryngeal of the etymon of √rudh (see EWA s.v. RODH), it appears synchronically to result from the sandhi form of a byform *vis before r-, just as there is a nís beside ní (with different meanings in that case of course). In particular note the form nīrohá- in a TS mantra repeated 3x (III.5.2.5, IV.4.1.3, V.3.6.3 sam̐rohò ’si nīrohò ’si), which could be derived either from ni+√ruh (cf. Keith’s tr. ‘descender’) with the same lengthening as in vīrúdh- or from nis+ruh (so Viśva Bandhu). I therefore explain our visrúh- as a learned (and/or playful) but false “restoration” of the putative *vis- underlying vīrú(d)h-. It is here that √sru may have played a part, by facilitating a false segmentation of vis-rúh- into vi-srúh- (on the basis of the phonological similarity of the roots) and thus blocking the application of morpheme-boundary sandhi between

*-s and r-. I tr. ‘outgrowth’. On a separate but related note, I do not think we need to
emend the form to gen. pl. *visrúhāṃ, an idea that goes back to Sāy., tempted Old inter alia, and is accepted by Scar in WG.

Having dealt with the details of this vs. piecemeal, we should now consider whether it too can be applied to both Agni and Soma, and the answer is yes. átya- is regularly used of both in passages too numerous to cite. Though Hotar is an esp.

characteristic role of Agni’s, Soma is also compared to a Hotar sometimes (IX.92.2, 6, etc.). Both are called both vṛ́ṣan- and śíśu-. We have already noted their positioning on the barhis ad 1b. Both are called yúvan-. The ‘outgrowth’ can be the flames of Agni and the traces of the spreading of the soma juice on the filter, often depicted on IX. However, it does seem that Soma is never qualified as ájara- ‘unaging’ -- a minor lack. The vs. situates both substances on the ritual ground at the moment of the offering.
