The standard tr. (Ge, Re, WG) take the root aor. injunc. kaḥ as modal (e.g., Ge “soll … bereiten”); Hoffmann doesn’t treat this passage. Although I do not think that kaḥ regularly shows such value, formulaic considerations suggest it does here: the phrase máyas √kṛ occurs at the end of a Jagatī pāda as máyas karat (subjunctive: I.89.3, V.46.4, VIII.18.7, X.64.1), once máyas kṛdhi (impv.: I.114.2). Truncating it to fit a Triṣṭubh cadence here would yield monosyllabic kaḥ, which may maintain modal value because of its association with the true modals in Jagatī cadences.
