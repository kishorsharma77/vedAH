etám tyám … marmṛjyánte apasyúvaḥ “This very one [=soma] do the industrious (fingers) groom,” with the same adj. qualifying the subject as here. Though the transitivity of the verb in 38.3 is quite clear, our passage is more ambiguous -- and has been discussed at some length by Ge (n. 7), Bl (RReps ad loc.), and Re. If we wish the verb to be tr., we can supply ‘you’, as Bl suggests (also Re as an alternative). Or we can take gíraḥ as acc., rather than nom., and tr. “the industrious ones constantly groom the songs …” However, I prefer to take the verb as passive (as two of the three forms of the pres. part. marmṛjyámāna- are) and see the vs. as an expression of ritual reciprocity: the songs are groomed by the power of Soma -- that is, the hymns recited at the Soma Sacrifice are refined and perfected by the inspiration given to the poets by Soma -- while those perfected hymns in turn adorn and beautify the soma offering.
