Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
13 verses: triṣṭubh
Like the previous hymn, this one exults in the mighty powers of Indra and in the  rich lexicon that describes them, although it is perhaps somewhat less insistent (but  see vs. 6ab). Also as in VI.18 the poet exhorts Indra to put his powers to good use  for the men associated with the poet. The three middle verses (6–8) all contain the  phrase “bring here to us,” each with a different abstract power as object, and the  remaining verses continue these requests for aid and support, especially in defeating  enemies and rivals.
