There is no obvious reason for the accent on the verb váhāsi. Ge (/WG), Re, Klein (I.243-44) take it as triggered by a subordinating ca, as does, somewhat tentatively, Old (ZDMG 60: 733 = Kl Sch 208). But this verse does not work very well as a conditional clause for vs. 7, and in fact Re recognizes this semantic disconnect by ending his tr. of vs. 6 with suspension dots. If vs. 6 is subordinated to anything, it would be better to connect it with vs. 5, repeating the message of vs. 4, which is likewise subordinated to 5. I would simply call attention to several passages with this same conjunction of elements with an accented verb and no clear motivation for the accent: III.43.4 ā́ca ... váhātaḥ, X.110.1 ā́ca váha ... We may be dealing with a catchphrase or with spread of the accent redactionally from a passage in which it was correct to superficially similar phrases.

On the vītáye construction, see disc. ad vs. 4.
