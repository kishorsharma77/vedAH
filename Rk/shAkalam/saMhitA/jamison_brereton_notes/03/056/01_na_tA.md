The standard tr. take b as obj. of minanti in a, which is certainly possible, while I take it as a separate nominal clause. The choice has no real implications.

In c I take ródasī as subj. of the infin. nináme in d, along with párvatā(ḥ), but the standard tr. (also Thieme, ZDMG 95: 90) supply a different infinitive in c, generated from minanti in a. So, e.g., Ge “Weder die Zauberkundigen noch die Weisen schmälern … / Nicht sind Himmel und Erde … (zu schmälern) …” I do not see the need for supplying additional material. The only possible semantic arguments might be 1) that the two worlds would not be subject to being bowed down (but I don’t see why), or 2) that vedyā́- wouldn’t be capable of performing something physical (like bowing down) but only mental/moral (like transgressing), but such an action seems well within normal limits for the Vedic conceptual universe. Another possible way to construe pāda c is to take ródasī as another subject of minanti: “nor do the two worlds transgress the commandments.” This has the merit of not supplying anything, but makes vedyā́bhiḥ harder to incorporate. Old suggests this possibility as well as supplying nináme; he does not suggest supplying a different infinitive in c.

The word vedyā́- can be either positive or negative depending on context.

Here it must be the latter; cf. also VII.21.5.
