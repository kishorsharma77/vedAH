Indra
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
10 verses: gāyatrī
The first part of the hymn (vss. 1–4) asks Indra for help in battle and for the wealth  (both material and in manpower) to make success in combat possible. With Indra’s  help, the sacrificer and his men become almost aspects of Indra himself. As he is  the “smasher of obstacles,” so they will “keep obstacles hemmed in.” They take up  Indra’s mace (vs. 3) and become his “hammers,” which smash their enemies. They  acquire Indra as their yokemate (vs. 4).
The second part (vss. 5–10) celebrates the extent of Indra’s power and the ben efits it brings to the men who attain him and it. This theme is first expressed rela tively straightforwardly (though with suppressed syntactic connection) in verses  5–6. But in verse 7 Indra’s vastness is conveyed by a striking image, syntactically  untethered, where his cheek and his gullet are compared to the wide, swollen sea.  This image introduces the final three verses (8–10), each of which begins evā́ hí “in just this way, in the same way.” In our view the underlying “same” is Indra’s  vast extent—both physically, in the images of verse 7, and metaphorically, in the  immense liberality (vs. 8) and help (vs. 9) he bestows on us. The final verse (10),  though introduced with the same expression, turns to our obligations to Indra,  and, again by implication, it is suggested that our praises of Indra are as vast as  his gifts to us.
The hymn is characterized throughout by chaining between verses, often not  overtly marked.
