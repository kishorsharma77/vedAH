Mitra and Varuṇa
Yajata Ātreya
5 verses: gāyatrī
The poet is intent on praising the expanse of Mitra and Varuṇa’s power: he says  they are of “great dominion” (vs. 1) and are “proclaimed among the gods” (vs. 2).  Then combining their power among both gods and humans, he calls them masters  over “earthly and heavenly” wealth and possessing “dominion among the gods” (vs.  3). The climax and purpose of this praise of their power on earth and in heaven is finally expressed in the last verse: they are lords of rains, which come from heaven  to earth.
## 1
Sing forth to Mitra and to Varuṇa with your inspiration and song. O you two of great dominion, lofty is our truth.
## 2
Sovereign kings, whose womb is covered with ghee, both Mitra
and Varuṇa
are gods proclaimed among the gods.
## 3
Show us your mastery over great wealth, earthly and heavenly.
Great is your dominion among the gods.
## 4
Serving the truth by the truth, they two have attained vigorous skill. Undeceiving, the two gods grow strong.
## 5
Bringing the heavens to rain and the waters to streaming, the two lords  of refreshments, bringing gifts,
have attained their lofty throne.
