From the spatial dual females of vs. 7 Nodhas now moves to the temporal: night and dawn, also dual females, whose activities have kept occurring “from of old” (sanā́t), linking them lexically to the two world-halves of 7a who were born of old (sanájā).

In dívam pári bhū́mā we encounter the not-quite-dvandva also met in 61.14; there in dyā́vā ca bhū́mā, dyā́vā was definitely dual, but its partner bhū́mā was either singular (with lengthened final) or plural. Here dívam is definitely singular, with bhū́mā either of the choices just given, probably singular.

punarbhū́- later (already in the AV) has a specialized legal application as a designation for a remarried widow (see Thieme Kl.Sch. 445-60 = KZ 78, 1963), but this sense does not seem to be in play here or in the other RV passages.

Though most take aktā́(which only appears here) as the ppl. of √añj ‘anoint’, serving as a poetic designation for ‘night’, I favor a root connection with the ‘night’ word, with zero-grade in the root syllable, esp. since aktú- ‘night’ is probably so connected (pace EWA s.v.). See EWA s.v. and AiG III.234, though both are skeptical. Of course secondary association with √añj would be natural.

JL notes the chiasmic kṛṣṇébhir aktā́-uṣā́rúśadbhiḥ of c; for a similar chiasmus see 11c.

JTK suggests that vápus- here and in other dawn/night passages refers to bridal clothing and suggests a tr. ‘finery’.
