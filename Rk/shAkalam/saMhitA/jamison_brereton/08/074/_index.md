Agni (1–12), Śrutarvan Ārksya’s Da ̣ ̄nastuti (13–15)
Gopavana Ātreya
15 verses: mixed anuṣṭubh and gāyatrī arranged in trcas, with the first verse of each ̥ trca anu ̥ ṣṭubh, the other two gāyatrī; final trca (13–15) all anu ̥ ṣṭubh
This hymn consists of five tr̥cas, each of which is thematically and syntactically uni fied. The first four (vss. 1–12) concentrate on the formal praise and invocation of  Agni, who appears in three of the four (vss. 1–6, 10–12) insistently as the accusative  object of the reverent approach of the worshipers. (The other tr̥ca, verses 7–9, has  the worshiper’s prayerful thought as its subject.)

Somewhat surprisingly, Agni is several times associated with a lexical and mythic  complex far more characteristic of Indra: obstacle [/Vr̥tra] smashing. Agni is called  the best smasher of obstacles in verse 4, and the theme returns in verses 9 and  12. This association may have been triggered here by the identification of Agni as  the tribal fire of the Anu (vs. 4), the group whose leader appears to be the poet’s  patron Śrutarvan (vss. 4, 13, 15). The tribal fire represents the (temporary) unifi
cation of separate groups of people generally mobilizing against outside threat,  and an obstacle-smashing tribal fire would serve their purposes well. Although the  unification theme is not insistent in the hymn, notice that the first verse begins by  announcing Agni’s affiliation with every clan, “dear to many” (vs. 1ab), and the joint  invocation of Agni by various peoples is repeatedly mentioned (vss. 2, 6, 10, 12).
The final tr̥ca (vss. 13–15), with slightly different metrical structure, is the poet’s  dānastuti of Śrutarvan and his gift of four horses and a chariot. Though it is not as  self-consciously clever as some dānastutis, verse 13 contains a nice pun.
