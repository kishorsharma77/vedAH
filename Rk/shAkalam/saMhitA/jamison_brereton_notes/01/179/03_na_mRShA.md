I take the first two of the three 1st du. subjunctives (b abhy áśnavāva, c jáyāva, d abhy ájāva) as hortatory, with the third, in a subordinate clause, as future in value.

Pāda d has been variously interpreted. The major issue is what (if anything) is the object of abhy ájāva, a problem made slightly more acute by the fact that abhí is not otherwise found with √aj until the ŚB (see Ge n. 3cd), making it likely that it owes its abhí to the parallel verb in 3b, abhy áśnavāva. Thieme’s solution (Gedichte 76) is the most radical: he makes the duals samyáñcā mithunaú the object: “wenn wir die beiden [Heer-]Hälften dem gleichen Ziel entgegenführen,” seeing Agastya and Lopāmudrā as leading two different wings of a metaphorical army. This is not impossible, but the fact that the duals are so appropriate to be the dual subject makes assigning them elsewhere seem somewhat perverse. Other tr. suggest other objects: Ge, on the basis of ŚB II.3.3.16, supplies ‘ship’, Re (and WG) ‘chariot’ (WG ‘Rennwagen’). Re tentatively specifies “le char de la vie?”; I would suggest rather the chariot of the sacrifice, given that that image is extremely common and that Agastya seems to be trying to redirect Lopāmudrā’s energy into ritual pursuits.

However, I’m not sure that any object needs to be supplied; the publ. tr. reflects an absolute usage ‘drive on’. Another small issue is the sense of mithunaú. For Insler (Vedic mith, 165), it is used contrastively with samyáñcā: “if we, who are now opposed, shall race on in harmony.” But the standard use of mithunaú to refer to the complementary oppositional halves of a pair, esp. a married couple, makes this otherwise appealing reading less likely.
