What “swell the bullish skin” means isn’t clear. Ge suggests that it refers to Indra giving in abundance. I interpr. it in conjunction with the phrase in the next hymn, I.130.8, mánave … tvácaṃ kṛṣṇā́m arandhayat “he made the black skin [=barbarians] subject to Manu.” If “black skin” is characteristic of our enemies, I suggest that the successfully swollen “bullish skin” refers to us, primed for battle.

My “(in that)” introducing c follows Ge: some sort of subordination is required to account for the verbal accent on parivṛṇákṣi, since otherwise *pári vṛṇakṣi would be expected.

The placement of utá ‘and’ in d is peculiar, since it precedes a series of concatenated datives lasting through pāda g. See Klein DGRV I.357-58, though he can only describe, not explain, this effect.
