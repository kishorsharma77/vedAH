The  intermediate hymns, X.11–13, have less superficially clear connections to the Yama  saga, but both X.12 (vss. 6–7) and X.13 (vss. 4–5) make important comments on  Yama and on Yama’s choice.  
There is also an underlying unifying theme, that of duality and twinned-ness: the  absolute disjunction between and the ultimate complementarity and unity of the  mortal and the immortal, life and death, men and gods, men and women, heaven  and earth, sacred and profane. It is appropriate that the cycle should begin with the  dialogue between the primal twins, Yama and Yamī, whose very names mean “twin”  and who bridge the gap between mortal and immortal.
