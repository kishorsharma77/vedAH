Soma Pavamāna
Avatsāra Kāśyapa
4 verses: gāyatrī
A satisfyingly tight structure knits together this little hymn. The first and last verses  contain the epithet “boundless” (vícarṣaṇi) providing a faint ring. More salient is  the chaining from verse to verse: a significant portion of the final pāda of one verse  opens the next verse.
The hymn also has extra-hymnic structural echoes: its final pāda is identical to  the final pāda of the first verse of the preceding hymn (IX.59.1), ascribed to the  same poet, save for “semen” in place of “treasure.”
