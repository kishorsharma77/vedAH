vígrīva- ‘with no / broken neck’ is ambiguous: is it descriptive of a preexisting condition and thus a species, ethnic, or personal slur (in English “no-neck” is an insult, referring to a burly and stupid thug or goon)? or is it used proleptically here, to indicate what will happen to those who “shake to pieces” (ṛdantu). I’ve taken it as the former, but opinion is divided and either would work in the passage.

mū́ra-deva- is also contested. Acdg. to EWA (s.v. mū́la-), flg. Wack., it is an r-form of *mū́la-deva- ‘whose gods are roots’ (Wurzelanbeter)(see also Brown).

This excursion into exotic anthropology seems unlikely to me -- not the sort of divinity that Vedic people would posit even of their worst and most primitive enemies. Most tr. take it as ‘idol-worshiper’ (e.g., Ge Götzanbeter), without, however, indicating what the ‘idol’ rests on: ‘root’ à ‘root as representation of god’ à ‘idol’ (not a semantic chain that seems reasonable to me)? Or, more likely to me, based on mūrá- ‘stupid, foolish, dumb (i.e., non-speaking)’. My own ‘with feckless gods’ is rests on this association, but is closer to the sense of the original adjective. I do not, however, have an explanation for the accent.
