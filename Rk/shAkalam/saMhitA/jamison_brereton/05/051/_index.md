All Gods  
Svastyātreya Ātreya  
15 verses: gāyatrī 1–4, uṣṇih 5–10, jagatī or triṣṭubh 11–13, anuṣṭubh 14–15  
The last of the All God hymns in Maṇḍala V, this hymn is far too long (fifteen  verses) for the position it holds, after a series of five-verse hymns. It is also not  unified metrically. It likely originally consisted of separate hymns, verses 1–4, 5–7,  8–10, with 11–15 as a later addition.  
Both in content and form, all the segments are simple, predictable, and closely  tied to the soma-drinking of various gods, especially those appropriate to the morn ing soma-pressing. This collection of strictly liturgical verses provides a curious  finale to the highly wrought, intellectually challenging, and deeply serious All God  hymns in this collection.
