The publ. tr. takes ā́yuḥ as obj. of rīriṣata, but it may be better to take naḥ as the obj. of that verb and construe ā́yuḥ with the inf. gántoḥ. Cf. Krick’s rendering (316): “Schädigt (tötet) uns nich mittendrinnen, bevor wir die volle Lebensdauer erreicht haben.” I would differ from Krick in taking gántoḥ as a gen. dependent on madhyā́“Do not harm us in the middle of our going through our lifetime.” For madhyā́+ gen. inf., cf. madhyā́kártoḥ I.115.4, II.38.4.
