Aśvins  
Pragātha Kāṇva  
6 verses: br̥hatī 1, 5, madhyejyotis 2, anuṣṭubh 3, āstārapaṅkti 4, satobr̥hatī 6, arranged  in pragāthas  
Like the previous hymn, this one contains a number of different meters, though all  fall into the twelve- and eight-syllable pādas that combine easily into mixed lyric  hymns. Unlike the tr̥ca structure of the last hymn, this one is arranged in pragāthas,  the first two of which (vss. 1–4) are irregular, while the last (5–6) has the familiar  br̥hatī/satobr̥hatī alternation.  
The hymn is a distillation of one of the key themes in the much longer Aśvin  hymns that precede it (VIII.8–9). The last pādas of the first and last verses are iden tical: “from there drive here, o Aśvins,” and most of the rest of the hymn (vss. 1–2, 5–6) consists of speculation on where “there” might be, with an array of cosmic  locations suggested. The middle two verses (3–4) invoke the Aśvins and remind  them of their devotion to us and to our sacrifice.
