I am puzzled by Ge’s (/WG) interpretation of this pāda, which introduces a thief with no support from the text (“Noch nie hat ja einer das Kleinod wie (ein Dieb) bei Schlafenden gefunden”). As far as I can tell, the proposed purport is that it’s easy for a thief to find (and presumably steal) a treasure that belongs to people who are asleep, but not so easy for us to do so in this case. WG remark that stealing something from sleepers is a favored theme in later literature. But it is not otherwise met with in the RV, as far as I know, and it doesn’t fit the context very well. I think the point is rather simpler: we had better get to work presenting our praise to Indra because the lazy and somnolent don’t get rewarded - “asleep at the switch” is an English idiom for people who don’t pay attention.
