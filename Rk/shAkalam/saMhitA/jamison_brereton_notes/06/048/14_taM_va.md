Despite the change in topic, sṛprá-bhojasam (a) responds to viśvábhojasam, which ends the previous vs. (13c).

The enclitic vaḥ in Wackernagel’s position in pāda a must wait for the verb stuṣe towards the end of d to find its syntactic niche. It refers, as usual, to the fellow priests on whose behalf the poet will praise the god. Ge’s “Diesen euren (Gott)” (sim.

Re), attempting to find a function for it within the first pāda, is unnecessary.

This vs. contains four gods to whom Pūṣan is compared and four adjectives. It is therefore not surprising that both Ge and Re distribute one adjective per god. My tr. differs: it honors the pāda boundary between c and d, which sequesters the twoadjective sequence mandráṃ sṛprábhojasam in the pāda with Aryaman, leaving Viṣṇu shorn of any epithet. This decision wasn’t made only on the basis of the pāda boundary (which would be weak evidence), but also because sṛprá-bhojas- ‘providing lush nourishment’ is an adjective more appropriate to the hospitable Aryaman than to Viṣṇu. See Thieme, Fremdling 105, 143; M+A 83. By contrast, Viṣṇu and Pūṣan are often mentioned next to each other, almost as if interchangeable (e.g. VI.17.11, VIII.54.5, with the pāda-opening pūṣā́víṣṇuḥ) and without descriptors.

The final infinitival ādíśe can be taken in a number of ways: Ge (fld. by Scar 221-22) rather whimsically as “um (ihm) einen Wink zu geben,” while Re instead gives “pour attirer-son-attention.” I do not think it can be separated from the two forms of ā́√diś (including vs.-final ādíśe as here) in the nearby Pūṣan hymn VI.56.1.

In that vs. I take the lexeme as meaning ‘designate (X as Y=epithet)’, and I think something similar is meant here: by giving Pūṣan attributes and identifying him with various gods I've uniquely identified him.
