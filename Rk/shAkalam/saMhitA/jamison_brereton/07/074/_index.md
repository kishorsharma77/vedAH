Aśvins  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
6 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas  
The metrical alternation of br̥hatī and satobr̥hatī structures this hymn into three  pragāthas. All three mention food, most often the soma (vss. 2d, 3b) or other nour ishment (vs. 5b) that the Aśvins receive. But the poet also describes the nourishment  that the Aśvins give (vs. 2a). The last two verses connect these two kinds of nourish ment in the climax of the hymn. In verse 5 the poet pairs the nourishment that his  patrons follow as they approach the Aśvins as a complement to the “glory,” their  prominence in the social order, that they receive from the Aśvins in exchange. As a  result these patrons become godlike—able to keep away “the wolf,” which represents  danger (cf. I.174.10 of Indra), and swelling “with swelling strength” (śávasā śūśuvuḥ;  cf. VII.93.2 of Indra and Agni, VI.19.2 of Indra, and I.167.9 of the Maruts). The  

ability of the Aśvins to go to every clan (vs. 1d) likewise parallels the “man-protec tors” (nr̥pātā́raḥ), or kings of the peoples, of the tribes consisting of clans.
