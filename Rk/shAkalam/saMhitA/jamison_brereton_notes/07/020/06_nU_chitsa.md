The final pāda has two linked uncertainties: the identity of the verb and the case form of rāyá. Though the Pp. reads dat. rāyé, gen.-abl. rā́yaḥ is equally possible.

The choice depends in great part on the analysis of the verb kṣáyat: whether it belongs to √kṣi ‘dwell’ or √kṣi ‘rule’. If the former, it would be a subjunctive; if the latter, an injunctive. The immediate context favors a subjunctive (dádhate in the rel.

clause attached to this main clause, plus bhreṣate [on this form as an s-aor. subj. to √bhrī, see EWA s.v. bhrī, with ref. to Hoffmann], reṣat probably, and āvívāsāt in ab), but this does not necessarily decide for an affiliation to ‘dwell’, because there are no overt subjunctives to the Class I present of ‘rule over’ (no *kṣáyāt) and the injunctive might function modally here. Parallel passages cut both ways. On the one hand, ‘rule’ regularly takes the gen. of ‘wealth’: cf. I.51.14 (of Indra) rāyáḥ kṣayati, VII.93.2 kṣáyantau rāyáḥ (Indra and Agni), X.106.7 kṣayad rayīṇā́m (though in an otherwise incomprehensible verse); on the other, a form of ‘dwell’ appears in a parallel passage with the material from the end of the pāda: VI.3.1 … sá kṣesad rtap ̥ ā́r̥tejā́ḥ. Old, having considered both possibilities, opts (slightly) for the latter; Ge’s tr. also assumes an affiliation with ‘dwell’ and a dat. rāyé: “der wird im Frieden lassen, um zu Reichtum (zu gelangen).” The publ. tr. instead chooses ‘rule over’ and gen. rāyáḥ, though I recognize that both possibilities were probably in the poet’s mind. One slender support for my choice may be the parallel phrase in 9d … vásva ā́śakaḥ… “you hold power over goods,” with gen. vásvaḥ reprising the gen. rāyáḥ that opens 9c.
