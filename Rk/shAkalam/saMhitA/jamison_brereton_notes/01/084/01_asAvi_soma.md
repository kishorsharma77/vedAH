Unlike the standard tr., WG take rájaḥ ‘Raum’ with the frame, not the simile: “… soll dich (und) den Raum erfüllen, wie die Sonne …” I assume this is because the simile particle ná, which usually follows the first word of a simile, here follows the second word, by most interpretations (rájaḥ sū́ryo ná raśmíbhiḥ). This does not seem to me sufficient reason to split apart this cosmological image. I attribute the position of ná to the particularly close association of sū́rya- and raśmíbhiḥ, which are frequently adjacent (cf. esp. the identical simile but without a third term … sū́ryo ná raśmíbhiḥ in VIII.43.32, IX.41.5).
