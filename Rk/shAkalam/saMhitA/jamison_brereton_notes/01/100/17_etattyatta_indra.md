The first hemistich appears to contain a pun on the patronymic of the poets named in cd, vārṣāgirā́ḥ -- with vṛ́ṣṇe in a, corresponding to the 1st compound member, and (abhí) gṛṇanti in b, to the root √gṝ ‘sing, greet’ found in the 2nd. The pun supports the derivation of vārṣagirá- from *vṛṣā-gír- ‘having a bullish song’ (so Gr) rather than from *varṣā-gír- ‘welcoming the rain’, as suggested by Scar (112) and endorsed by Mayrhofer (Personnamen, 82-83). The semantics of the proposed bull-compound seem superior to the proposed rain-compound, and the pun provides further evidence in its favor.
