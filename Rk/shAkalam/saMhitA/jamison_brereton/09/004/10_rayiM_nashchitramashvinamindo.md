Bring us glittering wealth in horses, o drop, through our whole lifetime. – Then make us better off.
The pattern of matches between the order of poets in the Maṇḍala I and that of  IX is broken by IX.5. The next twenty hymns (IX.5–24) are attributed to Asita  Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa, poets not otherwise found in the Anukramaṇī list  of R̥gvedic poets, though there are other poets with the patronymic Kāśyapa, as  well as Kaśyapa Mārīca, to whom a number of hymns, including several in IX, are  attributed.
