Agni Vaiśvānara
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
7 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7
Another Vaiśvānara hymn, and the cosmic aspects of Agni (and his double, the  Sun), extensively treated in VI.7, are touched upon (vss. 2–3). Verse 1 strongly  establishes a sacrificial context, however, which returns in verse 4, relating the  primal establishment of the ritual fire. The remaining verses (5–7) beg him for  benefits.
The hymn is also structured by a phonetic figure, the constant repetition of ini tial v- (see, e.g., 2c, 3a, 3c, all beginning with the preverb ví), indexing the epithet  vaiśvānara, a form of which occurs in every verse but 5.
