As indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. describes the kindling of the fire in typically enigmatic fashion, with multiple referents possible for each entity. (See the various tr. and comm. for disc.) It also contains in pāda b a version of the beloved paradox in which the child gives birth to his parents, though in this particular case I am uncertain what exactly is meant. The janayata in 4b picks up the janayanta in 2a, but with the subject and object reversed: in 2a the ten (fingers) begat the infant (fire); here the calf (fire) begets his mothers. Note that, while janayanta in 2a is a standard, formal -anta replacement (see my “Voice fluctuation in the Rig Veda: Medial 3rd plural -anta in active paradigms,” IIJ 21 ([1979] 146-69), janayata here seems to be a real middle: the mothers Agni begets are his own. For further disc., see comm. on the near-identical expression in IX.95.1.On the basis of the echoing of 2a, I assume that the mothers here are the fingers, though waters are also a popular suggestion -- one that does not fit the ritual context, in my opinion. The hard-working women in c are probably also the fingers, though kindling sticks are also possible, esp. on the basis of 5b.

svadhā́(-van)- is a signature word of this part of the hymn: 1c, 4b, 4d.
