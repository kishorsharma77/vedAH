I read pāda b with cd, contrary to the standard tr., which take it as independent. I might, however, replace the tr. of ádha as ‘then’ with ‘and’ or the like.

The first word of c, avā́s i ya, is generally taken as the gerund to áva √as lit.

‘throw down’. I am dubious about this interpr., since that lexeme is not found elsewhere in the RV or, acdg. to Monier Williams, anywhere else in Sanskrit. I therefore derive it rather from áva √sā / si ‘let loose, unhitch’, despite the formal difficulties. The idiom is used regularly for letting loose horses, to which Agni’s flames are compared here, and see X.61.20, where Agni is the subject of áva syati, a verse that contains vocabulary that resonates here: dvivartaní- and śíśu-. The problem is that we should expect avasā́ya with full-grade root and root accent (cf. I.104.1) or possibly *avasi yà (this zero-gr. form is recorded in Whitney’s Roots). I can only explain the accented long vowel in avā́s i ya as arising from confusion produced by augmented forms (cf. ávāsuḥ ‘they unhitched’ I.179.2).

I take the śíśumatīḥ ‘(females) possessing young’ to be Agni’s flames; they have young because flames beget more flames as they spread.

I take d as a paradox: the fire is in constant circling motion (parijárbhurāṇaḥ), but still produces a protective encirclement like armor.
