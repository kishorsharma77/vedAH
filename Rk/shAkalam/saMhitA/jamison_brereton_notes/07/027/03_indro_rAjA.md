The cid in d is somewhat surprising: cid generally means ‘even’, but “even when praised” (úpastutaś cid) is the opposite of what we should expect. Both Ge and I have avoided this problem by tr. cid almost as a subordinator or at least a circumstantial (Ge “zumal da …,” SWJ “just when”). I now wonder if it expresses anticipatory polarity with nū́cid in the following pāda (4a). Since nū́cid means ‘never’, cid in 3d could mean ‘always’.
