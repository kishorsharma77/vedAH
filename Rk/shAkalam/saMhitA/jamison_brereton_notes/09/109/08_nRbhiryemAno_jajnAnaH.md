It is not certain how to construe víśvāni with kṣarat, and how this is decided will also determine what to supply with the adj. Forms of √kṣar ‘stream’ without preverb generally do not take an obj. or an Inhaltsakk. (though cf. IX.35.3, 61.3, 86.37 for the latter), though it is found with an acc. of goal or extent of space (e.g., IX.33.2, 63.14). In vss. 16, 17 in this hymn, akṣāḥ has intrans. value, though in vs. 16 with accusatives of the space traversed. If we take the verb in that sense, víśvāni could pick up víśvā … dhā́ma in vs. 4, with the sense “stream to/across all (domains).” However, the phrase víśvāni dráviṇāni “all goods” might give us pause, and suggest that kṣárat here takes an Inhaltsakk., “stream all (goods).” There is no way to decide, and both may be meant. Ge, Re, and KH (123) all opt for the latter.
