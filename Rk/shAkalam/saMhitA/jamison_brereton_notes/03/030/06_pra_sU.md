Sāy. supplies ‘chariot’ as the subj. of pāda a, and in this he is followed by the standard tr. as well as Old. Although this is perfectly harmless and certainly possible, I do not understand why supplying a subject not found in the context is desirable, much less necessary. I admit that it would allow us to use the etu of prá … etu in b as the gapped verb with the prá of a, but Rigvedic poetic syntax is flexible enough to allow a 2nd ps. substitution in such a gapped phrase (prá … *ihi, anticipating prá … etu). The fact that 2b has a similar phrase with Indra as the 2nd sg.

supplied subject -- ā́tú prá yāhi … háribhyām -- also supports my assumption that the default subject is Indra.

Unfortunately the voc. indra in 6a was omitted in the publ. tr. The pāda should read “(Come) forth along an easy slope with your two fallow bays, o Indra.”
