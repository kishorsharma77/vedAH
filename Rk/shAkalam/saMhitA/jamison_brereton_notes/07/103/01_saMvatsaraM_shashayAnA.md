This first vs. is in Anuṣṭubh, as opposed to the rest of the hymn, which is Triṣṭubh, and it reads like a scene-setting introduction. Old suggests that it’s an addition.

The natural history phenomenon corresponding to the “year-long vow” (saṃvatsarám … vrata-[cāríṇaḥ]) undertaken by the frogs is surely estivation, as was already suggested by H. H. Bender in 1917 (“On the Naturalistic Background of the ‘Frog-Hymn,’ RV VII. 103,” JAOS 37: 186-91). The rains (here embodied in Parjanya) trigger the emergence of the frogs, in a frenzy to mate—what is known as “explosive breeding.” A loud chorus of male vocalizations attends the mating, calling females to the breeding place.

The pf. of √śi ‘lie’ is represented in Vedic only by the med. part. śasayāná-, found twice in the RV (also V.78.9). It has full-grade for expected zero-grade in the root syllable, matching the full-grade forms of the archaic root pres. śáye, part.

śáyāna-.

The presence of the stem brāhmaṇá- is of course a sign of the lateness of this hymn, since it is restricted to only the latest layer of the RV.

I now think the phrase brāhmaṇā́vratacāríṇaḥ “(like) brahmins following their commandment” may be a sly reference to brahmacárya- (first found in the AV, but cf. brahmacārín- in late RV X.109.5), which refers not only to the studentship phase of life stages, but also, specifically, to celibacy. The frogs, by virtue of their estivating state of suspended animation, have perforce been celibate, but they now go about energetically remedying the situation.

The phrase vā́cam … prá √vad is reminiscent of nearby VII.101.1 tisró vā́caḥ prá vada in a hymn to Parjanya, who is the instigator of the frogs’ speech here.
