Vāyu  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
5 verses: anuṣṭubh  
Unlike the two preceding hymns to Vāyu and Indra (IV.46–47), with their simple  diction and single purpose, this hymn to Vāyu alone, although it also continues  the journey motif, especially in the refrain of verses 1–4, contains some enigmatic  phraseology and striking images. In particular both the sense and the syntactic con  
struction of the simile in the second pāda of verse 1 are much disputed. On the  basis of VI.14.3 we believe “the riches of the stranger” (rā́yo aryáḥ) to refer to Ārya  people in general and their poets in particular.  
Note that the soma-drinking, the purpose of Vāyu’s journey, is mentioned only  in the refrain, and that the time of day for the ritual, early morning, is only obliquely  referred to, in verse 3.
