The combination of honoring Agni “in the seat of the waters” (a) and the Bhṛgus “once again” installing him among the clans (b) suggests that this vs. concerns the well-known myth of Agni’s flight and concealment in the waters and the Bhṛgus’ discovery, recovery, and reinstallation of Agni as the ritual fire. X.46.2 begins with a pāda identical to our pāda a and then relates the Bhṛgu’s finding of the fire gúhā cátantam “hiding in secret”: imáṃ vidhánto apā́ṃ sadhásthe, … padaír ánu gman / gúhā cátantam uśíjo námobhir, ichánto dhī́rā bhṛ́gavo ‘vindan “This one here

-- having done honor to him in the seat of the waters, they followed him along his
tracks ... / With reverences seeking him who was hiding in secret, the fire-priests, the insightful Bhrgus ̥ found him.” The same myth may be alluded to, in ring compositional fashion, in vs. 9 of our hymn. Note also that the poet to whom this hymn is ascribed is Somāhuti Bhārgava.
