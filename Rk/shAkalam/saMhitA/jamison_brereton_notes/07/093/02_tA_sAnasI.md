The first hemistich is hyper-alliterative, with sibilants s and ś and, esp. in the 2nd pāda, v and u, all tied together by alternations of short and long a: tā́sānasī́ śavasānā hí bhūtáṃ, sākaṃvṛdhā śávasā śūśuvā́ṃsā. This phonological effect is reinforced by the etymological figure of śavasānā … śávasā śūśuvā́ṃsā, all belonging to the root √śū, śvā ‘swell’. To capture the etymological relationship I would be inclined to adjust the publ. tr. to “o swelling ones .. swollen with swelling (strength).” It is difficult to say which of the qualifiers is/are being predicated of Indra and Agni with the bhūtám, but Ge, Re, and I seem all to have settled on sānasī́.

vā́ja- is modified by ghṛ́ṣvi- in IV.32.6, 9 and by sthávira- in VI.1.11, 37.5.

The two adjectives seem, if not contradictory, at least slightly incompatible, but note that Indra is qualified by the same two adjectives in the same order, case, and metrical location as here in III.46.1, VI.18.12. In keeping with the Indraic slant to 117 this hymn (on which see publ. intro.), it seems as if a phrase more appropriate to Indra has been transferred to the prize.
