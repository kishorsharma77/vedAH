Although the publ. tr. follows Ge (/WG) in rendering dakṣiṇatáḥ as ‘to the right’, it is also possible, given 2c pítryam ánu pradíśam “in the direction of the fathers [that is, forefathers/ancestors],” that dakṣiṇatáḥ should rather be ‘to the south’, since the south is ordinarily the quarter of the Pitars.

On īśata see comm. ad I.23.9.
