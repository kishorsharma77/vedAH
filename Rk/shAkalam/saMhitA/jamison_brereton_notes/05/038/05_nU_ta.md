I tr. slightly differently from the standard, supplying another form of syāma for ab, rather than making the whole vs. into a single cl. The difference is trifling.

Notice that abhíṣtibhiḥ echoes abhíṣṭaye in 3c.

WG suggest that this vs. is a joke: asking Indra to be in his śárman (‘protection, shelter’; German ‘Schirm’) is like asking to be under his umbrella (Regenschirm). This is a joke that may work in German but seems to have little to do with Sanskrit, which, as far as I know, does not have the concept of a rain-repelling umbrella. Shelters of that physical type are more likely used against the sun, and certainly I know of no use of śárman- in a rain context.
