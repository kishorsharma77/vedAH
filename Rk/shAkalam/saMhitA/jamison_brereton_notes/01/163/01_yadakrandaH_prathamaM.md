The tr. of púrīṣa- as ‘fertile ground’ is an adaptation of Krick’s (Feuergrundung, 101 n. 253). The basic meaning is ‘fullness, fulfillment’, but it can indicate fruitful, loose rich earth, bottom land, as well as overflowing fullness.

‘Fertile ground’ provides a nice semantic bridge between the abstract sense and the younger meaning ‘dung’.

I follow Re in taking pāda c as containing two de-composed bahuvrīhis at least functionally. Though Re generally overuses this explanation, in this case we have almost documentary proof, in that 9a contains both a real bahuvrīhi and a decomposed expression like this one in parallel: híraṇyaśṛṅgó ‘yo asya pā́dā “having golden horns, his feet copper.” In our pāda c the expressions are technically nominal sentences with possessive value, with the possessive pronoun te to be supplied from pāda d: “(your) wings (those) of a falcon, (your) forelegs (those) of an antelope.” But these are tantamount to bahuvrīhis and go more smoothly into English that way.
