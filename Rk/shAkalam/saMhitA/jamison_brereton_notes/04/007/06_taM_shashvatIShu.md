This vs. is structured as a series of paradoxes, one per pāda. The least clear is in pāda a, since there is only one qualifier, the loc. śáśvatīṣu mātṛ́ṣu “in ever new mothers,” which must be construed with vītám ‘enveloped’ in b. The paradox there is that ordinarily one has only one mother and that mother is not self-renewing. The physical reference must be to the pieces of wood (his mothers) in which fire inheres and from which he flashes out one by one. This physical image is developed in b: the fire is within wood -- therefore apparently in a fixed place -- but is unfixed, in that it is in constant motion in and over the sticks of wood. In c the fire inherent in the wood, therefore hidden, is also bright when it catches. Note another instance of the root √cit, citrám (matching the same word in 1d). And finally in d, when the fire catches it’s easy to see and therefore to find, but its movements are unpredictable.
