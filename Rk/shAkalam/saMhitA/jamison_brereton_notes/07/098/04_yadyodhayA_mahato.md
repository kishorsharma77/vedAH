On the s-aor. of √sah see Narten (Sig.Aor. 264-67) and on the lengthened grade of some forms of this aor., as well as elsewhere in the root, see Narten (op. cit.) Gotō (1st Kl. 325-26), EWA s.v. SAH.

On the root noun vṛ́t-, see Schindler (Rt.Nouns s.v.); it belongs with √vṛ ‘obstruct’ (etc.), not, with Gr, √vṛt ‘turn’. In this passage a derivation from ‘obstruct’ makes sense for the defensive forces that provide an obstacle to the attacking army.
