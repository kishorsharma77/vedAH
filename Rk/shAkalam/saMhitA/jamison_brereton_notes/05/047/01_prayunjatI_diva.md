As noted in the publ. intro., I take the subj. of this riddling vs. to be manīṣā́ ‘poetic inspiration’, but until this word appears (end of pāda c), the vs. both invites an identification of the subject with Dawn and makes that impossible. The nom. sg.

participles prayuñjatī́and bodháyantī are characteristic Dawn vocabulary, but Dawn is also regularly identified as “the daughter of heaven,” which phrase is here in the genitive: diváḥ … duhitúḥ. It is her “great mother” (mahī́mātā́) who is the grammatical subj.

My interpr. generally follows that of Old. Others (Ge, Re, WG) seek to make Dawn subj. at least of the first hemistich and are thus forced into awkward interpretations of the phraseology and into division of the vs. into two clauses.

Assuming (with Old and me) that manīṣā́is the subj. of the whole vs., the point would seem to be that the inspiration that produces the poetry of the early morning ritual has the power to beget even Dawn herself -- the usual semi-hubristic boast by the poets that even the cosmos is regulated by the ritual performance and the poetry recited there. The phrase “(coming) from the fathers” (by my interpr.; some others take pitṛ́bhyaḥ as dative) reflects the transmission of the poetic tradition from older generations to younger ones. For manīṣā́‘constantly calling’ (jóhuvānā), see VII.24.2 jóhuvatī manīṣā́, also adduced by Old.
