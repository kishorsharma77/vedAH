Soma Pavamāna  
Vasu Bhāradvāja  
5 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5  
Attributed to the same poet as the preceding hymn (IX.80), this hymn concerns  itself even more strongly with Soma’s connection with the gods, devoting the final  two verses of a five-verse hymn to a litany of gods invited to the soma sacrifice. The  preceding verse contains two occurrences of the word vásu “good (one),” which is  also the name of the poet. Soma’s task of mediating between the world of gods and  men is treated in verse 2, anticipating the appeal for his help to the poet in verse 3  and the invitation to the gods in verses 4–5.
