Despite sharing the evā́hí opening with vss. 8-9, this verse is not entirely parallel with those two, which express the vastness of Indra’s liberality and help. Here it is what we owe Indra, praise and recitation, that are implicitly suggested to be as vast as what he gives us. A tr. more parallel to the previous two verses would be “Just the same [that is, just as vast] are those things beloved of him, the praise-song and recitation to be proclaimed …” However, I favor the published tr., with śáṃsyā ‘to be proclaimed’ as predicate, because it provides a hortatory end to the hymn.
