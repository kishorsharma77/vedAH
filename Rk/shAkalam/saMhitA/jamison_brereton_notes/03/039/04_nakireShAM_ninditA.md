The next part of the hymn seems driven by the rhetoric of morphology, both parallelisms and contrasts. In this vs. note the heavy -i/anā-vant- forms mā́hināvān and daṃsánāvān stationed at the end of successive pādas (c, d), which are followed by dákṣiṇāvān at the end of 6d and the neut. barháṇāvat at the end of 8d.

Pādas a and c contain what appear to be matching sequences that conceal morphological differences: \#(nákir) eṣāṃ ninditā́… \#(índra) eṣāṃ dr̥ṃhitā́… The two -itā́forms are respectively an agent noun (ninditā́) and a neut. pl. ppl.

(dṛṃhitā́), though the two eṣām have the same grammatical identity and referent and the first word in each pāda is the subject.
