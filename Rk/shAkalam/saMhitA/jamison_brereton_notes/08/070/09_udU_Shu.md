The lexeme ud √mṛś is found only here in early Vedic, but like other combinations of √mṛś ‘touch’ + preverb, it seems to have a slightly slangy sense. Gr “jemand [A.] emporheben zu [D.],” but the sense of touch is lost. Ge “Streck fein (die Hand) für uns aus,” which fails to render both the root meaning and the preverb.

My “shape us up” attempts to render both, with the sense “make us ready/worthy to receive.” The insistent úd here, opening pādas a, c, and d, may be meant to contrast with ní in the following verse (pādas b, d).

Note the alliteration: ab … mahé, mṛśasva … and esp. cd … mahyaí maghavan magháttaye, … mahé# This is the culmination of a play on mah- and magha- forms in the central part of the hymn: 6a mahinā́, 6c maghavan, 8a mahó mahā́yyam.
