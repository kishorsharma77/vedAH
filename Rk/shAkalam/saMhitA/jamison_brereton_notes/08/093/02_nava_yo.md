Ge (flg. Gr) takes bāhvòjasā as an abstract tatpuruṣa (“mit Armes Stärke”), but it has bahuvrīhi accent and the other three occurrences are clearly bahuvrīhis. I follow Old in so interpreting it and supplying vájra- as the head noun.

The Pp. analyses vṛtrahā́vadhīt as containing an unaccented avadhīt. I prefer to read it with accented ávadhīt, which allows the ca to conjoin two parallel relative clauses. Since in this interpretation the verse consists entirely of relative clauses, it must be dependent on either the preceding or following verse. Either would work, but the presence of an apparently resumptive sá beginning 3a favors the latter.
