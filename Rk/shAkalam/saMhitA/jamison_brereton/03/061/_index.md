Dawn
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The only hymn dedicated to Dawn in Maṇḍala III, it combines the usual themes: the  beauty of the young goddess, her relation to the morning ritual and the ritual fire,  and her role as giver of rich goods because of the distribution of priestly gifts at the  Morning Pressing. Note that halfway through the hymn (beginning with vs. 4), the  direct 2nd-person address to Dawn changes to 3rd-person description. This change  may mirror the development of the ritual: first the poet coaxes Dawn to appear,  and when his pleas have been successful (the vocatives of the first verses are in part  replaced by aorists and perfects of the immediate past), he turns his attention to the  ritual her appearance has set in motion.
