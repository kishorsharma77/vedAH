In b urú rájaḥ ‘broad realm’ is identical with antárikṣam ‘midspace’.

Perhaps supplying two terms for one place is designed to give the impression of the usual three-termed whole, earth, midspace, heaven — here: earth, midspace x2. The river’s physical position presumably precludes claiming that she has filled heaven as well.
