Pāda a contains another etymological doubling, vardhitā́várdhanaḥ “strengthening strengthener,” rather like the doubling of priyá- in 38c.

Note the allit. in c: … pū́rve pitáraḥ padajñā́ḥ.

The expression gā́ádrim uṣṇán “burned the cows out of the rock” is, to say the least, unusual - and on those grounds disputed. A long tradition, going back to Benfey, emends the text to *muṣṇán ‘stole’, with degemination in the sequence ádrim (m)uṣṇán. This emendation is accepted by, inter alia, Ge and Bloomfield (RR ad I.62.2 and Conc.). There is one strong arg. in favor of the change: √muṣ ‘steal’ is formulaically embedded in the Vala myth (see Ge’s n. 39d and, e.g., I.93.4 yád ámuṣṇītam … paṇím gā́ḥ “when you two stole the cows from the niggard”). Other possible args. are inconclusive: both √muṣ and √uṣ have a 9th class pres., though the latter is only represented by one other form, part. uṣṇán in II.4.7 - but √uṣ is a poorly attested root. The preverb abhí found in our passage does not appear with either root. In the end the clinching arg. seems to me to come from Old, who does not accept the emendation: the meter. The proposed change converts a good cadence into a bad one. Bl. (RR) argues “that the change from ádrim muṣṇán to ádrim uṣṇán was made by the redactor in deference to the meter.” But why would the poet have produced a bad cadence in the first place? I think it more likely that the poet was playing on the rhyming roots √muṣ and √uṣ, with full knowledge that the former is the standard one in the Vala myth, and he is forcing us to invent a new and more difficult image with the latter root. By supplying us with jyótiṣā he is providing us with the means to do so. Old adduces X.87.12 jyótiṣā … ny òṣa “with light burn down …,” comparable to our … jyótiṣā / yénā … uṣṇán and with a verb form of √uṣ.

A poet who could deploy the “placer of the sun” formula in the manner he did in the previous vs. is surely capable of such a sly play on words.
