I supply “lifetimes” (ā́yūṃṣi) in c, because ā́yus- is the standard object of prá √tṛ. Ge assumes that the object is the referent of the following relative clause (yé ta ukthínaḥ … (“Fördere fein … die, welche als deiner Lobsänger…”). This is possible, but ignores the usual idiom.

What it means to “purify (Indra’s) resolve” isn’t clear to me, but the phrase occurs elsewhere (cf. VIII.12.11, 13.1). In any case the father of the patron Dasyave Vṛka is Pūtakratu (see VIII.56.2, also 4), so this is a pun.
