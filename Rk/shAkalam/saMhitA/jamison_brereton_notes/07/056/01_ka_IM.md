Ge takes cd to be the answer to the question in ab, but since vs. 2 seems more directly responsive to the question, I take cd here as simply further specification of the subject of the question.

Unusually, īm has no acc. function; there is no possible accusative role it could fill.

I consider vyàktā(s) to be at least an implied pun. The first reading is as the nom. pl. m. of the ppl. of ví √añj ‘anoint, ornament’, referring presumably to the Maruts’ characteristic adornments and their glistening appearance as (wet) bearers of rain. This interpr. is reflected in all the standard tr. However, I think it also is meant to contrast with sánīḷāḥ ‘of the same nest’, as an indication that the Maruts are also separate individuals, and employing the common ví / sá(m) polarization. The problem is to identify a morphological form that could be represented by vyàktā(s) and express the sense ‘separate, individual’ vel sim. I hesitantly suggest that we start with the -añc-stem, vy-áñc-, found only in the cmpd. uru-vyáñc- ‘wide-spreading’.

(The rarity of this stem may be accounted for by competition with the well-attested stem víṣvañc- of almost the same meaning [‘facing in opposite directions, divergent’], which looks like a more substantial version of vyáñc- and is built to the extended form víṣu of the same preverb ví.) If vyáñc- made a collective abstract in -tā-,

*vyáktā- ‘individuality, separateness’, the form in our passage could be its instr. sg.

in adverbial usage. There are obviously weaknesses in every link in this chain of reasoning. First, the stem vyáñc- is very rare and limited in distribution; second, I know of no other such abstracts to -añc-stems and in fact -tā-stems are relatively rare in early Vedic (AiG II.2.617); third, it should be accented *vyáñc- (AiG II.2.619).

However, a poet intent on packing a pun into vyàktā(s) might not scruple to use unusual forms to achieve it, and elsewhere in the RV puns sometimes ignore accentuation for their 2nd reading. In slight support of the suggestion, we might note that this set of hymns has one other ex. of the instr. of such a stem in adverbial usage:
