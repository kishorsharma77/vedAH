Though both Ge and Re make amṛtatvé ‘immortality’ and śrávase syntactically parallel, despite superficial appearances they are in different cases and should be so rendered. In the 2nd hemistich kṛṇóṣi has a complex direct and indirect object phrase: ubháyāya jánmane máyaḥ kṛṇóṣi práya ā́ca sūráye, with the chiasmic structure DAT.- IO ACC-DO VERB ACC-DO DAT-IO arranged around the verb. In such a structure we might expect coordinating ca to be positioned immediately after the 1st term of the second object complex, that is, after práyaḥ (práyaś ca); see Klein DGRV I.54 and passim. The interruption of this balanced construction by ā́is also curious; the point seems to be that Agni makes refreshment for the first, mixed set of beneficiaries in an unspecified place but the meal for the patron right here (ā́) on the ritual ground. It may be that the propensity of ca to follow preverbs in tmesis (/adverbal usage) has dictated the position; Klein implies as much (DGRV I.134 and n. 49, 227).
