The chaining continues, with vā́jasātaye likewise ending pāda a of this vs.; see also 6b.

√pū + ACC (here pávasva … íṣaḥ [etc.]) should rightly have the preverb ā́in the idiom ‘bring through purification’; see esp. Re’s n. In tr. I have supplied it, partly on the assumption that since this hymn is constructed of ready-made phrases, this pāda may have been adapted from a context where the previous pāda contained the ā́in tmesis. Re also points out that the construction here can be under the influence of pávantām ā́in 5b. I do not follow Re in seeing √pū without preverb as becoming indiscrinimately transitive in IX, with the sense ‘couler’.
