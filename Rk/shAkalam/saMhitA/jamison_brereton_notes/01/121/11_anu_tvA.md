Hoffmann (191 n. 157) insists that ánu … madatām must be an impv. This interpr. is of course possible, but I do not see its necessity. He also interprets siṣvapaḥ as a subjunctive. This is also possible, esp. because the other two forms to this redupl. aor. are athematic (síṣvap). However, again it is not necessary, since redupl. aorists are overwhelmingly thematic, and old athematic ones get thematized (cf. augmented ádīdharat beside dīdhar).

I have no idea why it’s worth mentioning that Heaven and Earth have no wheels, a seemingly obvious fact, unless to contrast them with Etaśa and the Sun’s wheel in 13b.

In d the easiest thing to do with acc. varā́hum ‘boar’ is to take it as an appositive to vṛtrám (much earlier in the hemistich). But the problem, of course, is that Vṛtra isn’t a boar but a cobra (/serpent). Indra’s boar opponent is Emuṣa, and that may be the referent. (See I.61.6-7, where the Vṛtra and Emuṣa myths are told in two successive verses.) However, given that the Śuṣṇa myth is related here in the two preceding verses (9-10), I think that Śuṣṇa may be the referent. He does, after all, snort (e.g., I.54.5 śvasanásya … śúṣṇasya).
