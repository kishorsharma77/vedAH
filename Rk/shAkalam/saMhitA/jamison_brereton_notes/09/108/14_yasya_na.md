The nom., acc., voc., and gen. pl. of marút- do not fit any standard RVic cadence. It is not surprising then that though instr. marúdbhiḥ and dat./abl.

marúdbhyaḥ are regularly found in cadences, the other forms are almost entirely absent. Pāda b has a nom. pl. in the cadence (made worse by the fact that the word is preceded by a light syllable, (yá)sya. VII.32.10 has the same sequence, also in a double yásya construction. Most of the few other cadential forms are found in dimeter vs. (e.g., VIII.3.21, VIII.7.30).
