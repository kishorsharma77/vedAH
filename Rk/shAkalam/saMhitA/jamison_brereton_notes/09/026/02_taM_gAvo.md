The phrase dhartár- diváḥ (also in opposite order) “supporter of heaven” is well established and used elsewhere in IX of Soma (IX.76.1, 109.6); it is of course the default interpr. here, shared by Gr, Ge, Re, and the publ. tr. inter alia. However, the ā́in the middle of the phrase (dhartā́ram ā́diváḥ) is troubling. It should not be a preverb in tmesis, since it is not adjacent to a metrical boundary and is not in a pāda with a finite verb (nor is there an appropriate verb anywhere in the vs.). The standard use of ā́in such positions is as an adposition, and in particular, in the position before an abl., with the meaning ‘all the way to’. Cf. for this exact expression ā́diváḥ I.92.17 “all the way to heaven,” of a ślóka- ‘signal call’ whose noise goes to heaven. I therefore think there is a syntactic and semantic pun in this vs.: the first reading is “supporter of heaven” with a gen. diváḥ (and the ā́essentially elided), but the second is “all the way to heaven” with an abl. diváḥ governed by ā́. This latter reading indicates that the lowing of the cows found in pāda a (gā́vo abhy ànūṣata) goes not only to Soma on the ritual ground but also to heaven, where the heavenly Soma is found

-- as is made clear in the next vs. That the material going to heaven is noise reminds us of
I.92.17 with the same expression.
