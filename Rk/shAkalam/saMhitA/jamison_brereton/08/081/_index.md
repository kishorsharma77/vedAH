Indra  
Kusīdin Kāṇva  
9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
Though assigned to a different poet, this hymn, like the last one (VIII.81), addresses  Indra with a certain irreverence and informality, with multiple demands that Indra  seize goods and bring them to us, in addition to the usual praise of his power and  generosity. One verse is somewhat puzzling: the middle verse (5), in which Indra  seems to participate in the ritual in priestly roles as well as being the object of wor  
ship, but this theme is not pursued.
