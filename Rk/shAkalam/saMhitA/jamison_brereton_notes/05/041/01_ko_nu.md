The conjunction vā ‘or’ dominates this vs.: there are 4 overt occurrences (twice in b, once each in c and d), as well as covert encodings, beginning with vā(m mitr)āv(aruṇ)āv (the latter two inverted) in pāda a and ending with the last word of the vs., vā́(jān). The end of the 2nd pāda, vā dé, with two monosyllables that, inverted, produce dévā(ḥ) (though with wrong accent for *devā́ḥ), draws further attention to vā.

As noted in the intro., the prominence of vā may establish a theme of choice or alternatives appropriate to the mass of gods mentioned in the rest of the hymn, and vā also echoes the last syllable of the phrase víśve devā́ḥ “All Gods,” to whom the hymn is dedicated.

Given the plethora of vā-s and the absence of any finite verb, save for intrusive trā́sīthām in c, it is not surprising that interpretations of the structure and syntax of the vs. are all over the map. In addition to the standard tr. (Ge, Re [EVP IV, V], WG), see also Old, Lü (Varuṇa 585-86), Schindler (Root nouns, 24-25), Klein (II.203-4), Scar (581), Keydana (Inf. 155 n. 142). I will not rehearse them all here.

Like many of these interpr., I take the three vā-s of bc as defining a tripartite structure of roughly parallel entities. I then assume that the vā of d is situated on a higher level of structure and is contrasting abc with a new clause inaugurated in d.

The two clauses (abc and d) are separated by the independent interjection trāsīthāṃ naḥ closing c. As Ge points out (n. 1c), trāsīthāṃ naḥ has a similar role elsewhere (IV.55.1, VII.71.2); IV.55.1 is especially similar, since it is in the first vs. of an All God hymn that begins kó vaḥ (like kó nú vām here), with Mitra and Varuṇa as the subjects of trā́sīthām.

My interpr. of the larger structure rests on taking dé at the end of b as an infin.

(with many, but not all) and assuming that the poet has exploited the voice neutrality of infinitives to give it passive value in abc (“[is] to be given”) and active value in d (“[is] to give”). This further assumes that káḥ refers to the (mortal) recipient in abc and, resupplied in d, to one of the gods. With these assumptions in place, the case relations in the two syntactically distinct parts of the vs. fall into place: the nom. káḥ … ṛtāyán “who, performing the truth …” of pāda a is the mortal worshiper and recipient of the gods’ largess; his counterpart in d is the dat. yajñāyaté. The vām of pāda a is to be interpr. two different ways: in the first part it expresses the divine beneficiaries of the mortal’s service; resupplied in d, it should be construed with likewise resupplied káḥ (or better kataráḥ) “which of you two?” The tripartite vā structure of bc details the three sources of gifts that may be given to the worshiper: heaven, earth, and the ritual ground. They are subtly unparallel: ‘heaven’ is a straight noun, either in abl. (as in the publ. tr.) or gen.; earth is represented by a deriv. adj. ‘earthly’ in the gen. (pā́rthivasya). It is a partitive gen., and if diváḥ … máhaḥ is gen., it too is partitive. If it’s an abl., it expresses the source.

The third term, “at the seat of truth” (ṛtásya … sádasi), expresses the place where the gift is to be given. Scar supplies ‘at the seat’ for all three terms. This is not impossible, but the poet seems to be aiming for slightly skewed and off-balance phraseology, and three different types of expressions for three parallel terms would suit his purposes admirably.

In the new structure of d, with active value of the infinitive dé, vā́jān is its object. The last grammatically unparallel functional parallel is yajñāyaté … paśuṣó ná. Assuming that it is a gen. sg. (Old and Re take it as acc. pl.), paśuṣáḥ ‘of one who wins cattle’ is in some sense parallel to yajñāyaté ‘for the one who sacrifices’, in that the vā́jān (‘prizes’) come to both. But paśuṣáḥ is a gen. dependent on vā́jān, while yajñāyaté is the indirect object with the infin. dé.
