With most, I interpr. iṣáyanta as ‘derive nourishment’, though Lub lists it with √iṣ ‘send’ and WG tr. “streben,” presumably assigning it to √iṣ ‘seek, desire’.

The acc. singulars yám … yajñám probably do not belong together, although an interpr. “whom they approach as the sacrifice,” with Agni identified with the sacrifice, is not impossible. Ge considers it attraction from *yásya … yajñám, but a loose purpose/goal accusative, almost a pseudo-infinitive “to sacrifice,” seems syntactically acceptable to me.
