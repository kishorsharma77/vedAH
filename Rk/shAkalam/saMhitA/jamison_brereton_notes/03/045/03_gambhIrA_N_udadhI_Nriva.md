As noted in the publ. intro., this is the middle vs. of the hymn, and it contains four similes, which are interlocked in interesting ways. In the first halfverse both similes target krátum ‘resolve, will’. In the first the term held in common (gambhirā́n ‘deep’) has been attracted in number to the upamāna (udadhī́n ‘pools’), though the position of the iva probably shows that ‘deep’ lies outside the simile proper (gambhirā́m̐udadhī́m̐iva, krátum …). This simile is not dependent on the verb, while the second one (krátum puṣyasi gā́iva “you foster it like cows”) requires the fosterage of the verb puṣyasi for the comparison to make sense. That is, Indra’s will is like cows only in that he cultivates it and helps it prosper, whereas it is “deep” regardless of any verb that might govern it.

The second hemistich contains two parallel similes, both bipartite, with a nom. pl. referring to entities that reach an acc. goal: cows / pasturage, brooks / lake. The first, the bovine one, seems generated from the cow simile of pāda b, esp. as the adj.

sugopá- (c) contains the same gó- as gā́ḥ in b. The interesting thing about this halfverse is that the frame, the upameya, is not expressed at all. There is neither an overt nom. of the entity(/-ies) in motion nor an acc. goal -- simply the simile marker iva.

The comparison is wide open. Sāy. suggests that soma drinks are the subj. to be supplied, and he is followed by the standard tr. (and Old). Old suggests that the goal is either “you” (=Indra) or his krátu-; Re shares his uncertainty, while Ge (/WG) supply “dich.” Although it is true that āśata takes soma drinks as subject in other passages (see Ge’s n. 3cd), this hymn does not otherwise mention soma, and I am wary of supplying it out of nowhere. I prefer to take krátu- as subj., either in the pl.

(‘resolves’ as in the publ. tr.) or, as Ge. suggests in n. 3cd, as a sg., with the verb attracted to the number of the subjects of the two similes. And I take āśata in a different sense in the frame than in the similes -- without expressed goal as “reach fulfillment, achieved (their goal),” although I recognize that the overwhelming number of occurrences of this verb do have expressed goal.
