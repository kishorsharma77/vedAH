The last pāda of the verse (d) is identical with the last pāda of vs. 3 (c), but the point is very different. In vs. 3 the poet asks the Aśvins to pay attention only to him despite the activities of other poets; here it’s “we” who are moving the Aśvins, but the poet still asks for their exclusive attention. Given the constant interchange between 1st singular and plural in ritual situations, I find it difficult to think that the poet is trying to distance himself from his priestly comrades and get the Aśvins all to himself. But I don’t have a good explanation.
