Various semi-understood myths are alluded to here, with minimal (or no) identification of the subjects of the three parallel injunctives (tudát, váhat, and tsárat).

I am inclined to take the subject of all three as Indra (who is clearly the subject of the middle one), but see both Ge and Old for discussion of other possibilities.
