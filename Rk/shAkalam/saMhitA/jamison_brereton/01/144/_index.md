Agni  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
7 verses: jagatī  
As in other of Dīrghatamas’s Agni hymns, the kindling of the ritual fire provides  the major theme of this hymn. In particular, the middle verses 3–5 concern the pro duction of fire by the two churning sticks and the growing strength of that fire. The  hymn begins, however, with the already fully matured fire, identified as the Hotar,  going about his ritual duties (vss. 1–2). The verse immediately after the kindling  verses (vs. 6) opens the ritual frame: Agni there is the ruler of the realms of heaven  and earth, and he even attracts those divine figures (probably Heaven and Earth,  though some have suggested Night and Dawn) from their cosmic positions to take  their place on the ritual ground. The final verse (7) is a typical hymn-ending verse,  commending the hymn just recited to Agni’s enjoyment.
