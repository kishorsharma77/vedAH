You two, Indra and “Mountain” [=mace], who fight in the front— whoever would give battle to us, smash that very one away—with a
mace smash that very one. (Under these circumstances, even) an abyss will be pleasing to (that one,)  who has fled into the distance—an abyss he will seek to reach.
O champion, (surround) our rivals all around on all sides—let the
splitter split (them) on all sides.
