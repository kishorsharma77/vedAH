The perennially difficult dhā́man-, found also in 3b, is a bit difficult to interpret here as well. In both 3b and 4ab, the dhā́man- appear to be concrete and locatable in space, for which the tr. ‘domain(s)’ fits well (cf. also WG “Stätten”). But then in cd Soma is urged to accept our oblations with them, which seems difficult to do with a place and edges closer to Ge’s “Formen,” a nebulous and all-purpose rendering that I try to avoid with this word. Re’s “structures” doesn’t help either. I must assume that “accept with all your (domains)” is a compressed way of saying “wherever you are, accept.” The same problem is found, to some extent, in vs. 19.
