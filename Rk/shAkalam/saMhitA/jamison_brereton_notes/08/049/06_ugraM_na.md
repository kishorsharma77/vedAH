The simile marking in pāda a seems unnecessary: why is Indra like a powerful hero, rather than, as usual, simply being one. Perhaps the tendency for many verses and half-verses in this hymn to begin with similes enforced that pattern here.

In c the double marking of the simile (udrī́va … avató ná siñcaté) also seems to serve no purpose.

kṣáranti … dhītáyaḥ is very close to kṣáranti dhītáyaḥ in the matching hymn VIII.50.4.
