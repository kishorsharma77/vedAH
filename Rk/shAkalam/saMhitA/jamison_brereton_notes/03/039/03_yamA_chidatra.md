The first pāda of this vs. is a definitional truism: the cmpd. serving as subject, yama-sū́ḥ ‘twin-bearing’, is split into its component parts in the VP, yamā́… asūta ‘bore twins’. The question is who are the twins. Given the context, I find Old’s suggestion (fld. by Re) that this is a metaphor for speech production and that the twins are, perhaps, the verse (ṛ́c-) and sāman more plausible than Ge’s interpr. (flg.

Sāy.) that the twins are the Aśvins and the birth-giver is Uṣas. I take the mother to be the dhī́- who was the subject of the previous vs.; note that dhī́ḥ is the last word of vs. 2.

Since I take the same noun to be subject of b, pátat emerges as a problem, since it is presumably a neut. nom./acc. act. participle but qualifies the action of the proposed fem. subj. Given the tendency for neut. NA forms to be used adverbially, I so interpr. it here (as Re also seems to: “en volant”), rather than (with Ge [/WG]) introducing neut. mánaḥ ‘mind’ here for it to modify. This hemistich echoes some of the vocabulary and themes found in the previous hymn. asūta in pāda a matches ásūta in III.38.5a, and note that the apparent product of this birth is also a dual in III.38.5c. As noted ad III.38.9c, both the tongue and the mounting in that pāda are found in our 3b. I do not think the same events and entities are referred to in these passages, but they do seem to have a similar view of the relation between poetic speech and creation.

The standard tr. interpr. c as meaning that the pair just born associate with some kind of generic beauty (Ge “Schönheit,” Re “les formes-de-la-beauté”), but vápūṃṣi are esp. associated with Agni in Maṇḍala III, where he assumes or bears these wondrous forms (cf., e.g., III.1.8, 18.5, 55.9, 57.3; though admittedly he is not the only entity that has such forms). I think the vápūṃṣi of Agni are at issue here, and the pair -- verse and sāman -- accompany them as the ritual speech being recited when the ritual fire is blazing.

Unfortunately the verse-and-sāman interpr. does not fit as well in pāda d, where we might wish the dual “smashers of darkness” to be endowed with light one way or another. The only other occurrence of this stem modifies Agni, and Agni is several times subj. of the phrase támaḥ √han (V.14.4, VIII.43.34). This phrase once has a dual subj. (VI.72.1 víśvā támāṃsy ahatam), but the subj. there is Indra and Soma, whom we surely do not want to introduce here. It is worth noting that the Aśvins, the subjects here acdg. to Ge et al., are not found as subj. of this expression.

Since I think there is good support for the verse-and-sāman interpr. in the rest of the vs., I would argue that these forms of ritual speech are called smashers of darkness because of their role in the dawn sacrifice.
