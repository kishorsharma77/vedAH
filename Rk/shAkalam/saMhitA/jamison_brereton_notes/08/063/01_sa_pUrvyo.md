The two parallel perfects ānaje and ānajé, each final in its hemistich, require two different functional interpretations, the first passive, the second transitive, with a double accusative. Kü (95-96) recognizes more or less the same two functions (patientiv and agentiv-reflexiv) for this perfect stem, but curiously claims that the perfect to this root is found only in Maṇḍalas I and X, though offering no alternative interpretation of these forms here.

Various referents have been suggested for the vená-: Indra (Old), Soma (Ge).

I favor Agni, for the following reasons. First, the actions of ab and cd, whose correspondence is signalled by the identical verbs, take place in the divine realm in ab and in the human one in cd, where Manu directs his action to the divine. This situation suggests a ritual scene, and the Vena, who is the target of both acts of smearing, should then be a middleman between the divine and human in the ritual.

This figure can only be Agni or Soma. As for the rest of the vocabulary, pūrvyá- can be used of Agni, Soma, and Indra, but is most regularly Agni. Likewise Agni is often the object of √añj; cf. esp. III.14.3 yát sīm añjánti pūrvyáṃ havírbhiḥ. And Agni several times opens doors (e.g., I.128.6, III.5.1, VIII.39.6). With Agni covertly mentioned in this verse and Soma overtly in vs. 2, the whole ritual scene is set.
