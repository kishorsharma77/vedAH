This vs. sets out the identification between soma and rain most clearly (which is, nonetheless, not all that clear). In pāda a the “embodied cloud” (ātmanván nábhaḥ) is, on the one hand, a cloud, which produces rain (called ghee and milk); on the other, it must refer to something from which soma (called ghee and milk) is produced - most likely the soma plant, with Ge (n. 4). The milk (páyaḥ) here seems not to refer to the actual milk mixture.

The word ātmanvánt-, which I render ‘embodied’ (others ‘living, breathing’), is found only three times in the RV, once in another Kakṣīvant hymn (I.116.3 to the Aśvins) and once in another Aśvin hymn, I.182.5. In both those passages it refers to a boat, and I suggest ad I.182.5 that this describes a boat with a cockpit, a substantial body. Here it would indicate that the cloud had enough substance (“body,” as in the Engl. metaphor) to yield significant amounts of liquid, and it may also sketch the rounded contours of a cloud.

In b, with most, I take soma to be the referent of ṛtásya nā́bhiḥ. See comm. ad IX.73.1.

The subj. of cd are in the first instance the priests, but in d esp. there is a double reading, with the Maruts pissing rain, as the priests “piss” down streams of soma by their ritual activity.
