With Ge (/WG) I supply “to those two” in b, to provide both a goal for icháñ carati and an antecedent for yáyoḥ in c.

III.54.3-4: The co-occurrence of ṛtá- and satyá- in these two vss. (3a, 4b) is striking.

In keeping with my estimation of the difference in meaning between the two, I tr. the first as ‘truth’ and the latter as ‘real(ity)’. In both cases here the sense of satyá- is close to the English idiom “come true,” that is, “become real.” In 3a the poet is asking that the cosmic truth(s) associated with Heaven and Earth be realized in our own sphere, that H+E put themselves out, as it were, for our benefit. 4ab also concerns the truth(s) associated with H+E -- hence the adj. ṛ́tāvarī ‘truthful’ -- and the older poets, in finding these two entities that possess their own truth(s), spoke words (presumably about and in praise of H+E) that both reflected the reality of those truths and that also came true (satyavā́caḥ). This vs. esp. emphasizes the poets’ process of discovery of the truths about H+E.

As Re points out, the vs. contrasts the priests or poets in ab with the warriors in cd.
