ET comments “1.50.12 is AVS 1.22.4, AVP 1.28.4, the final verse of 4-verse compositions for getting rid of jaundice. However, it's interesting that in both AV recensions the first verse refers to the sun, but it's not the same as RV 1.50.11. The RV seems to have a tṛca which incorporates the verse that appears as 1.50.12 whereas AV tacks it on to a different tṛca. On the other hand, the 1st pl verb forms are jarring in RV 1.50.12, but in the AV they harmonise with other 1st pls.” This formal and structural argument suggests that the verse was taken over from Atharvan context, a possibility that its contents also support.
