Pāda a contains a 2nd plural enclitic prn. and a plural voc. (vaḥ sakhāyaḥ “to/of you, o comrades”), while c has two 2nd singular imperatives (árca gā́ya). The discrepancy in number must reflect the common situation of a poet’s mixing address limited to himself with address to his colleagues and fellow ritual participants. So Ge (n. 22), and see my 2009 “Poetic Self-Reference in the Rig Veda and the Persona of Zarathustra,” BAI 19 (Fs. Skjaervø). Ge suggests without much enthusiasm that árca  gā́ya could be shortened 1st sg. subjunctives (*árcā *gā́yā), evidently responding to Caland/Henry’s reading the verbs thus in their 1906 L’Agniṣṭoma, p. 428 (see Old, who likewise rejects it). It’s worth noting that VI.45.4 has the same configuration but with 2nd plural imperatives: sákhāyaḥ …, árcata prá ca gāyata “o comrades, chant and sing forth …” This parallel is adduced by Bl (RR) ad V.52.4, where he calls our verse “a scrappy stanza …modelled after existing patterns” (that is, VI.45.4). The parallel is certain apposite, but I doubt that our number discrepancy is simply the result of our poet jumbling together scraps drawn from different sources.
