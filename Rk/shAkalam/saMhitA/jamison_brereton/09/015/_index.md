Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
8 verses: gāyatrī  
A simple device provides formal unity to this hymn: the form “this one” that begins  every verse. In the first six verses it is the nominative subject (eṣá), in the last two  (vss. 7–8) the accusative object (etám), so that there is some progression and devel opment, even while the referent remains constant.  
Except for verse 2, the focus is entirely on Soma’s journey across the fleece and  into the cup, where both the waters (vs. 5) and the milk (vs. 6) await him. (The men tion of grasses in vs. 6 is unclear.)
