sī́dañ chyenó ná yónim ā́, as well as IX.96.23 śakunáḥ ná pátvā and with the pl.

VIII.21.5 sī́dantas te váyo yathā “sitting like birds” very similar to our passage. I suggest that birds are the underlying comparandum here as well, and that this underlying target is qualified by vanúṣaḥ ‘rapacious’, or, as I render it “raptor (birds).” This produces a more satisfying, or at least more interesting, simile than Re’s “like devotées,” and it is constructed from readily available elements - though it does require more machinery.
