The redupl. form ápīpyan is implicitly assigned by Ge to √pā ‘drink’ as a redupl. (causative) aorist: “Dich haben … die … Männer getränkt,” an analysis I follow. However, the majority opinion is that it belongs to √pī ‘swell’, which is not out of the question. The competing claims and morphological possibilities are discussed above ad VIII.66.7 with regard to apīpema. Our form here could have the expected zero-grade to an athematic stem (ápīpy-an), and the long reduplication could be correct for a causative reduplicated aorist, although since the cluster -py- is undistracted here, a short reduplication might be expected (type AV atitrasan).

However, since most of the forms of the act. redupl. aorist paradigm would not have such a cluster (*ápīpet, etc.), the long reduplication would surely be generalized. For further disc. of the proposed formation see VIII.66.7.
