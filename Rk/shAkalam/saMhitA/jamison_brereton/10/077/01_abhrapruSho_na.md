Like (the Maruts) showering (rain) from a cloud with their speech  [=thunder], I will shower goods with my speech. The sacrifices of a  discerning one [=poet] are like [=just as good as] those provided with  oblations.  
I have praised the flock of them as if praising the Formulator [=Indra?],  who is well provided with Marutsâ€”have praised them for their  worthiness (of soma), as if for their beauty.
