Among this group of mainly male divinities we find the Wives (gnā́ḥ, a word only used for the Wives of the Gods in the RV) and Sarasvatī in the 2nd hemistich.

The first pāda consists only of vocatives, each accented since there is no inherently accented word preceding. In b the accent on mā́ruta (modifying pādainitial śárdhaḥ) is surprising, however, since it follows the verbal lexeme prá yanta with accent on the preverb, and the following voc. viṣṇo lacks accent following utá.

Notice the coincidence of verbal endings for two different person / number / voice combinations: yanta 2nd pl. act. impv. √yam; juṣanta 3rd pl. med. injunc. √juṣ.
