On the thematic and punning ring composition of this vs. with vs. 1, see the publ. intro.

In the finale of b, suvitā́ya návyam, návyam is at least superficially adverbial and works well in that guise. However it’s worth nothing that suvitā́ya návyase with two datives is found in Jagatī cadence in III.2.13, V.11.1, VI.71.3, IX.82.5, and I imagine that ours is simply adjusted to the demands of Triṣṭubh (though we should of course expect návyaḥ if this involved simple truncation).
