On the structure of this hymn and its relationship to the previous hymn IX.102, see publ. intro. Unlike IX.102, the variant of Uṣṇih employed here seems to be 8 8 / 12: in two of the six vss. the configuration of words makes a separable 4- syllable final pāda impossible (2c: … kṛṇute háriḥ#; 3c … saptá nūṣata#), and though the other four vss. end with a 4-syllable word, only in vs. 1 does this show the syntactic distancing found throughout IX.102.

As was noted in the publ. intro., IX.102 and 103 share thematic and lexical material. A list of the most obvious includes vs. 1: vedhás- / 102.4  jújoṣate / juṣánta 102.5 vs. 2: “three seats” reminiscent of trī́ṇi in 102.3, not to mention the two tritá's in 102.2, 3.

vs. 3: vā́ṇīr ṛ́ṣīṇām saptá / 102.4 saptá mātáraḥ vs. 4b: viśvádevo ádābhyaḥ / 102.5b víśve devā́so adrúhaḥ This pattern breaks down in the latter part of the hymn. Moreover, IX.103 is considerably more straightforward than 102, and it also possesses a different, quite salient structuring device, the fronted preverb that opens each vs.: prá (1), pári (2-6).

As was also noted in the publ. intro., pári has less and less integral connection to the rest of the vs. as the hymn goes on.
