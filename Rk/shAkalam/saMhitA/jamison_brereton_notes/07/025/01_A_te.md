Although mahá(ḥ) in the first pāda is a genitive, I have tr. it in the vocative phrase to avoid the awkward “(Be) here with the help of you, the great one, o strong Indra.” Ge supplies ‘mind’ from d as the subject of the first pāda, but this seems unnecessary.

I take pāda c as a clause parallel to b, with the yád in b having domain over both, hence accented pátāti in c. By contrast, Ge (see also Old) takes it as a circumstantial clause dependent on d and supplies “(Wenn).” This is certainly possible, but my solution seems simpler.

The threatened possibility of Indra’s wandering mind may account for the capturing of his mind in the previous hymn, VII.24.2.
