Since áśvayā is fem., the tr. should be emended to “with a golden mare.” See Ge’s disc. (n. 8cd) and dismissal of Roth’s proposed emendation (also rejected by Old), to bring out the comparison of the stream of soma to the urine stream of a horse, which, as Ge points out, is still possible without emendation.
