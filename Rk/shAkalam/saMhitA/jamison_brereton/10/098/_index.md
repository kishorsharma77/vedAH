Devāpi’s Plea for Rain
Devāpi Ārṣṭiṣeṇa
12 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn contains a prayer for rain, set in the context of a similar (successful)  prayer in legendary time. The protagonists of this legend are Devāpi, a priest and  poet, in fact the Hotar and Purohita (at this late stage in the R̥gveda this latter  priestly role seems to have become established) for Śaṃtanu, presumably a king,  and the god Br̥haspati. The first four verses consist of a dialogue between Devāpi  (vss. 1, 3), Br̥haspati (vs. 2), and, in our view, Śaṃtanu (vs. 4, though some schol
ars consider this verse the speech of Br̥haspati). Devāpi requests Br̥haspati to act  as intermediary for him, asking the appropriate god to send rain. Devāpi must  have made this request standing by the ritual fire, for in verse 2 Br̥haspati identifies  Agni as their go-between and then provides Devāpi with a speech, presumably a  charm that can provoke rain. Devāpi acknowledges this gift in verse 3, and in verse  4 Śaṃtanu asks Devāpi to perform sacrifice.
The next three verses (5–7) summarize the successful outcome of this story. With  verse 8 the hymn turns to present time and to the god Agni, who carried the original plea from Devāpi to Br̥haspati. The present poet again asks Agni to send rain (vss.  8, 10, 12), while mentioning somewhat wistfully the many sacrificial gifts we might  receive (vs. 9)—gifts that he then offers to Agni (vs. 10) to present in turn to Indra  (vs. 11).
