Contra standard tr., I do not take anāgástvam as the obj. of dádāśaḥ, since √dāś seldom takes an object that is not a god, and when it does, it is a ritual offering.

Instead I take it as belonging to a parallel nominal clause, still in the domain of yásmai.

The final phrase that is the ostensible main clause, té syāma “might we be they,” violates number agreement: pl. té cannot properly pick up sg. yásmai. This is a variant of a common tag and feels tacked on.
