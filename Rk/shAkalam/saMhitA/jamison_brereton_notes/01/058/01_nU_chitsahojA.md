Phonetic figure spanning the end of the first hemistich and the second (esp. its end): ... vivásvataḥ# #ví ... , ... havíṣā vivāsati# The lexeme ní √tud is generally taken to mean something like ‘spur on’, but that tr. fails to render the ní. I prefer to take it in the literal sense ‘push down, force down’, meaning that, in the English idiom, you can’t keep Agni down.

I connect pāda b with c, rather than with a, as the standard tr. do, because of the difference in tense (pres. ní tundate, impf. ábhavat). This tense mismatch requires the yád of b to have the sense “ever since” (Ge[/WG] “seitdem,” Re “depuis que”), which does not seem to me to be natural to it. By contrast, Agni’s assuming the office of messenger in b leads directly to his journey in c.
