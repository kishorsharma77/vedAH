sumánas- here recalls the two occurrences of sumatí- in 6a and 8a (see disc.

there); this word two may have dual value: both ‘benevolent, well-disposed’ and ‘having a good mind’, that is, one capable of producing good thoughts in the form of hymns.

The dyumnā́ni of the arí- “the brilliant things of the stranger” that Agni opened up for us in 6d we seem to have thoroughly taken possession of here. The gen. jánānām here corresponds to aryáḥ in 6d.
