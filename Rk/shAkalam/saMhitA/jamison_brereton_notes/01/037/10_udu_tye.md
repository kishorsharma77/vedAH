The standard tr. separate pādas a and b and supply a verb with the former (e.g., Ge “stimmen”) with no obvious source. I prefer to take the two pādas together and take kā́ṣṭhāḥ as an unmarked simile: “their songs (like) race-course posts.” The lexeme úd √tan then has the meaning ‘stretch upward, erect’; this is the only finite form of the idiom in the RV (or, it seems, anywhere), which is mostly attested in the frozen adjective uttāná- ‘stretching upward, stretching out’.

Why their knees are bent is a matter of speculation, but it probably refers to a crouching position suitable for driving (cf. VIII.92.3).
