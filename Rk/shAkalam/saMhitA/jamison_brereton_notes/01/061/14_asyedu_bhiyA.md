dyā́vā ca bhū́mā has the appearance of a dual dvandva, interrupted by the ca that connects it to the NP with which it’s conjoined, giráyaś ca dṛḷhā́ḥ. But the uninterrupted dvandva is actually dyā́vābhū́mī, with a different stem for ‘earth’, and bhū́man- (n.) has no dual attested (and its dual should of course not be bhū́mā, but probably *bhūmanī). See the next hymn for a variant on this usage. It is likely that the lengthened N/A sg. form or the N/A pl. form is being used, but why? On this problem, see AiG II.1.152.

In the publ. tr., “other” was careless omitted at the end of the first hemistich: it should read “against each other.” The mention of the poet Nodhas at the very end of the verse has perhaps been prepared by several not entirely expected o’s: úpo ... jóguvāna oṇíṃ, sadyó, only the last of which is a normal sandhi o < -as. The poet’s fondness for his own vowel may account for the appearance of several relatively rare words: the intensive jógu- and the noun oṇí-.
