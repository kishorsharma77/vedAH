A series of four singular nouns are the subject of dadātu, a singular verb.

The verb niyuvaíte is esp. appropriate for Vāyu, who is regularly called niyútvant- ‘having a team’. Note the use of this adj. in the immed. preceding hymn, VII.39.2, where it must qualify Vāyu rather than Pūṣan, despite the word order (see comm. ad loc.).
