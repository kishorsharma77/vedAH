Because of the accentual difference between vācáḥ in 25a and vā́caḥ in 26b, we must construe the two superficially near-identical phrases vācó agriyáḥ and agriyó vā́caḥ quite differently. The first is a single constituent with dependent gen. vācáḥ, but in the 2nd agriyáḥ and acc pl. vā́caḥ belong to different constituents, despite their adjacency: vā́caḥ is the (or rather, an) obj. of īráyan.
