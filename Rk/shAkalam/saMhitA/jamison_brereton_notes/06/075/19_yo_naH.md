I take the phrase svó áraṇo yáś ca níṣṭyaḥ as a three-member sequence indicating progressive distance from the speaker. I'm assuming that in this context an áraṇa- is someone who inhabits the same general territory, but belongs to a different group, while the níṣṭya- are from beyond the territory. Re’s tr. (Hymnes spéc.) is in agreement: “Celui, proche ou lointain ou même étranger.” Others seem to take the 2nd two terms as (near-)synonyms; so explicitly Klein (DGRV I.108-9).
