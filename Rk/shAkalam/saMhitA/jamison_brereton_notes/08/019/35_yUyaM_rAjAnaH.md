The triple voc. phrase váruṇa mítrā́ryaman is accented despite being internal in a pāda that begins with tonic elements. There is no obvious reason for this: although the vocc. follow the caesura and immediately follow an enclitic (vayám té vo, váruṇa mítrā́ryaman), neither of these factors ordinarily triggers voc. accentuation. See, e.g., I.122.7 stuṣé sā́vāṃ, varuṇa mitra rātíḥ, where both conditions are found. For discussion of a similar case, see comm. ad VII.59.1.
