Although the general semantic range of the root-noun cmpd niḥsṛ́jaḥ in bc is fairly clear -- it refers to the releasing of the cows enclosed in the cowpen -- its grammatical identity is not. It can be either a transitive nom. pl., as I take it in the publ. tr. (so also tentatively Old and, it seems, Re, Narten [SigAor. 266-67]), or a gen. or abl. infinitive (so Scar, WG). In a sense it scarcely matters.

I follow Narten (Sig.Aor. 266-67) in taking sákṣanta(ḥ) [-aḥ so Pp., not -e] to √sah ‘conquer, be victorious’ rather than √sac ‘accompany’ (so Gr; Ge’s and Re’s tr.

do not easily reflect either root). WG take it as a type of desiderative with -s-formant, but also to √sah. Support for this root affiliation comes from sāsahānáḥ in the next verse, likewise opening the c-pāda.

Note the paired opposition of the two verbs ví √taṃs ‘yank (apart /) back and forth’ and sám √ūh ‘shove together’, with complementary subj./obj. pairs: people (yank) Indra / Indra (shoves) people. The point is that the opposing forces fight over having Indra on their side, each trying to pull him to its side, while Indra sets the two sides to fighting by pushing them together.

Again I take the intens. āvíṣ kárikrat as expressing habitual or continuous action: Indra is always showing off his mace.
