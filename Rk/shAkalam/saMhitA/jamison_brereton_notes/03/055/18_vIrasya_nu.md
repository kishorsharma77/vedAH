In my interpr. this vs. announces the arrival of Indra with a splendid team of horses. This new topic is signaled by prá nú vocāma beginning pāda b. The exact arrangement of the six and five isn’t clear to me. Re suggests that the double nú indicates that there are two separate clauses here. He may be right (“now there is an abundance of horses of the hero; we will proclaim (it) now”), though the difference in sense is slight.
