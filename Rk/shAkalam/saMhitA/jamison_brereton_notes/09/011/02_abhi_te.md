Pāda c consists entirely of a rudimentary etymological figure, deváṃ devā́ya devayú. The acc. devám is of course Soma as god, coreferential with páyaḥ ‘milk’, a metaphor for soma the substance, in pāda a; the dative devā́ya is Indra. I take devayú as an adverb; so also Re. It is also possible (see, e.g., Re’s n.) to take it as a neut. modifying páyaḥ, as Gr does -- and, it seems, Ge. In that case, devám would need to be a neut. adj.

‘divine’ (Ge’s “die göttliche”), but the number of clearly adjectival uses of devá- is very low. See, however, IX.13.5 and VII.21.1.
