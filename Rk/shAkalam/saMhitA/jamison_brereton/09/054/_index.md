Soma Pavamāna  
Avatsāra Kāśyapa  
4 verses: gāyatrī  
Like the last hymn, this one withholds unambiguous identification until the end  of the hymn, while employing suggestive vocabulary in the earlier verses. However,  unlike the last hymn, the poet does not try to mislead the audience into supplying  

the “wrong” referent. Rather, the hymn is structured as a series of explicit riddles: a  form of the pronoun ayám “this one” opens each of the first three verses (and also  2b), and what is predicated of “this one” fits, or can fit, the Soma paradigm. The  explicit solution to the riddle is given in the last pāda of verse 3, with the name  Soma prominently situated. And the final verse brings the drop (índu) and Indra  together in the same way as IX.53.4.
