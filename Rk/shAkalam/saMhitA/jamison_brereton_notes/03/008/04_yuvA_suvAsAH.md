Kane (HDŚ II.1.269) suggests that the image in this vs. is that of a young boy, well dressed and encircled with his sacred thread (yúvā suvā́sāḥ párivītaḥ), at his Upanayana, whom they “lead up” (ún nayanti), in an idiom close to the úpa √nī of the Upanayana. Acdg. to Kane, several gṛhya sūtras employ this mantra in the Upanayana.
