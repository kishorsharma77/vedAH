Savitar  
Gr̥tsamada  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn is typically, and in our view rightly, identified as an evening hymn, in  which Savitar quiets the world for the night. The hymn is closely analyzed by Falk  (1988), who argues that the occasion of the hymn is the evening of the summer sol stice, which marked the beginning of the rainy season. According to Falk, in the sec ond millennium bce on this night the Milky Way rose from the horizon at dusk. The  arc of the Milky Way, he says, was pictured as the outstretched arms of Savitar. Be  
that as it may, most of the images in the hymn are applicable to evening in general. The first six verses present a lovely series of images of the quiet and rest that  evening brings to the natural and the human world—almost ironically because the  daily round of busy movement ceases at the “impulsion” of the “Impeller” (the  literal meaning of Savitar). In the following two verses (7–8), Savitar’s ability to  bring each creature to its home place at night is extended: he also has assigned to  all categories of creatures their proper position in the natural world. The remainder  of the hymn celebrates the power of Savitar even over the gods (vs. 9) and asks for  his gifts (10–11). The latter verse makes reference to Savitar’s distribution of beings  to their separate realms by asking for gifts from heaven, the waters, and the earth.  Savitar’s apportioning of benefits in these last verses return us to the theme of the  first verse (1cd), which announced his gifts to gods and to the mortal sacrificer.
