The logical and syntactic connections between the nominal expressions of ab and the clause in cd are not clear. Ge simply pronounces ab elliptical and suggests supplying cakruḥ from cd, while Re supplies “(telles sont/est)” with the two phrases.

My assumption is that the promptings and vision of truth are the indirect cause of the actions in cd by defining the proper tasks that all should perform throughout their lifetimes.
