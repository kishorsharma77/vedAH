Ge (/WG) and Re take tanvàm in d as a reflexive pronoun and tr. “I extol myself” (e.g., Re “(étant) ton laudateur, (c’est en fait) moi-même (que) je loue.”) Although I accept this as a secondary reading, I think the primary sense of tanvàm must be ‘body’ here, namely the body of Agni. Such is Sāy’s interpr., followed by Old (SBE). The expression seems just a variant of V.28.4 ágne vánde táva śríyam “O Agni, I extol your glory”; moreover, tanvàm is found in a number of Agni passages referring to ritual procedures done on/to the body of the fire (e.g., III.18.4, VI.11.2, VII.8.5).
