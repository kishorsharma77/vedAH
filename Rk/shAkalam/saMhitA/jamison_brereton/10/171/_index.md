Indra
Iṭa Bhārgava
4 verses: gāyatrī
This brief hymn makes allusion to four unknown or little-known myths involving  Indra, one per verse. All four verses begin with t(u)vám “you,” and three of the four  (not vs. 2) contain a vocative addressed to Indra—repetitions that provide some  unity to a hymn made up of fragments.
