The stems návyas- ‘newer’ and pratná- ‘age-old’, found at opposite ends of the preceding vs. (a and d), are juxtposed here in the phrase pratnā́návyasā, in case the duller members of the audience had missed the contrastive terminology in 4. But this phrase is doing two other things as well: du. pratnā́refers to the Aśvins, who were, in 4d, identified as yúvānā ‘youths’; and návyasā modifies vácasā, “with a newer speech,” repairing the slightly off phrase in 4a, where it was the singer, not his song, who was newer.

The pf. babhūvátuḥ should not have been rendered as a straight pres. in the publ. tr. I would change to “who have become.” It also forms a slight figure with śámbhaviṣṭhā, which precedes it immediately before the pāda break.
