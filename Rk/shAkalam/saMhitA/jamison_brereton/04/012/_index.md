Agni  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first half of this hymn (vss. 1–3) describes the rewards Agni gives to a pious  sacrificer. The second half (vss. 4–6) is entirely different: it begs for release from  unspecified offenses done by us, and although Agni is addressed in the vocative  in all three verses, the tone is distinctly Ādityan, reminiscent of Vasiṣṭha’s pleas  for forgiveness from the most formidable of the Ādityas, Varuṇa, in Maṇḍala  VII. In fact, the last verse (6) has a plural addressee (“good ones worthy of the  sacrifice”) in addition to Agni, and the verse is repeated exactly in X.126.8, an  insistently Ādityan hymn.
