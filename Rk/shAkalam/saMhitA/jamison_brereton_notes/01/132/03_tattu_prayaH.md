A very opaque verse, which has received multiple interpretations. I will discuss only my own, very tentative, one here.

I take pāda a as the announcement to Indra of the “pleasurable offering” (práyaḥ) currently set out for him at this sacrifice (asmín yajñé 1f); see nearby I.134.1, 135.4 for similar usage of práyas-. This glittering offering reminds the poet of a previous one (pratnáthā). I take the next two pādas (bc) as describing this previous one; the relative locative yásmin yajñé is a temporal expression that picks up the temporal pratnáthā.

The crux in bc is the pair vā́ram (b), vā́r (c). Since the former is an obj. of ákṛṇvata and the latter a (possible) subj. of ási, an analysis as a masc. (or at least gendered) root noun suggests itself, but such a noun has at best a precarious existence (see Schindler WurNom s.v.). Nonetheless, I think it must be posited here; the other solutions, which include taking the two forms to two separate stems (see, e.g., Gr, Lub) or decomposing them into vā + a… (Hoffmann apud Schindler, WG), do too much violence to the patterns of Atyaṣṭi meter. With Ge and Re in their separate ways (“Schirmer(?)” “protecteur”) I take the form to √vṛ ‘cover’ and tr.

‘shield’ (as in X.93.3). In b this noun in the acc. is in apposition to unexpressed tvā ‘you’, i.e., Indra -- which is the first obj. to a double acc. √kṛ construction ‘make X into Y’. (For Indra as a home, see 5fg. For kṣáya- in a metaphorical sense, see the next hymn, I.133.7a.) In the tag-pāda the construction has been switched from acc. to nom., and the 2nd sg. ref. is now overt (asi ‘you are’). A nom. vā́r conforms to this case switch; however, since kṣáya- is masc., we should expect *kṣáyaḥ here. I explain the anomaly by the pressures of Atyaṣṭi, which requires strict identity between the finals of b and c; kṣáyam is simply repeated from b or made an honorary neut. for the occasion. It is possible to avoid this problem by assuming that vā́r- has verbal rection (so implicitly Ge “der Schirmer(?) des Hauses”; see also Schindler WurNom), but this introduces further complications, and I prefer the double acc. interpr. anyway.

If bc refers to a time in the distant past when Indra was made into our protector, d may then call for the restatement of this fact at the current ritual (depicted in pāda a by my interpr.) The expression nū́itthā́te pūrváthā ca pravā́cyam “Now in the current way and in the earlier one it is to be proclaimed of you” in 4a supports my interpr of the larger stucture of this verse, namely that it concerns the conceptual intersection of the current ritual and the previous one and that what has been said before needs to be restated at the current sacrifice. Note also that, though the form of √vac, voceḥ in this case, now has the preverb ví, the sequence vocer ádha, with the adv. ádha, echoes ádhi vocā in 1e.

In e I take raśmíbhiḥ as a temporal expression “with the rays (of the sun),” identifying the time as dawn, as is very common. The standard tr. take it as an instr.

of the means of seeing; this is not impossible, but seems less idiomatic. See further ad I.135.3.

I don’t quite know what to do with ánu in f, but given the other difficulties in the verse, this is a minor problem.
