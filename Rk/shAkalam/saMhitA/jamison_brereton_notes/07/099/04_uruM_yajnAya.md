As was just noted, the first pāda of this vs. is identical to I.93.6d, where Agni and Soma are the dual subjects. Indeed, the identity of the dual subjects in this vs. is left hanging throughout the vs., and the poet may have left a false trail: the last du. 2nd ps. referents were the two world halves (ródasī), addressed by Viṣṇu in 3ab.

Assuming that the hymn as we have it is a unity (rather than consisting of two separate tṛcas, plus summary vs., as is possible), ródasī would remain a live possibility for the subj. of this vs. until the final pāda (d), where the 2nd du. subjects are addressed as narā ‘superior men’, suppling a gender that clashes with fem. ródasī.

But since nṛ́- has a wide range of reference, this still does not definitively identify them. Even the dual number leaves the identity open: nárā is used of the Aśvins (mostly), Indra-Vāyu, Indra-Agni, Indra-Varuṇa, Mitra-Varuṇa -- and only once (here) of this pair. It is only with the first word of the following vs. (5a), the voc. índrāviṣṇū, that the question is settled.

All of the deeds recounted in this vs. can be attributed to Indra alone (see publ.

intro.), although Viṣṇu’s role in enlarging and defining cosmic space may be alluded to in pāda a, with the creation of space for the sacrifice. Re’s claim that ab belong more to Viṣṇu, cd more to Indra is overstated: the cosmogony in b has little to do with what we know of Viṣṇu but is associated elsewhere with Indra.

As Old points out, the name of the Dāsa in c, Vṛṣaśipra, seems akin to Viśiśipra in V.45.6, whom Manu defeats (note that Manu figures in our vs. 3b) -- a connection not registered in Mayr.’s Personennamen. However, as noted in the comm. ad V.45.6, this gets us nowhere, since we know nothing further of either of these figures. More interesting is the potential relationship between these names and Śipiviṣṭa, the epithet of Viṣṇu found in the RV only in this hymn (vs. 7) and the next (VII.100.5, 6). The first member of this epithet, śipi-, looks like a Caland form of the 2nd member of the two names, śipra-, while the 2nd member, viṣṭá-, is esp. close to the 1st member of the name found in V.45.6, viśi-; vṛṣa- in our passage is a plausible reSansritization cum folk etymology of a possible MIA form *visi-, underlying viśi.
