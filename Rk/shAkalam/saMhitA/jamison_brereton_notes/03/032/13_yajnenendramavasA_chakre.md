The reciprocity expressed by complementary verbal forms to √av found in the 2nd half of the last vs. is here wrapped up in one word, the instr. ávasā, which I tr.

twice: I use the aid provided by the sacrifice (cf. 12d) to bring Indra here with his aid (cf. 12c). In Ge’s tr. it is only Indra’s aid, but he allows for the other possibility in n.

13a. Re and WG also associate it only with Indra. Given the balanced expression of 12cd, I think it is meant to have a double reading.
