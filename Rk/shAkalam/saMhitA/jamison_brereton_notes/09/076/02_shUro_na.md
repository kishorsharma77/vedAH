The participial phrase svàḥ síṣāsan “striving to win the sun” is a match for svàḥ yád … síṣāsati in nearby IX.74.1 “when he strives to win the sun” (also IX.7.4), where I suggest that the sun stands for the gleaming milk with which the Soma will unite at the end of his ritual journey. This association would be emphasized in our passage by gáviṣṭiṣu ‘in the cattle raids’, with cattle standing for milk, as usual. For further on sun=milk see comm. ad vs. 4.

As Ge points out (n. 2d, not reflected in his tr.), ajyate has a double sense, since it can be the passive both of √aj ‘drive’ and √añj ‘anoint’. Both are appropriate here.
