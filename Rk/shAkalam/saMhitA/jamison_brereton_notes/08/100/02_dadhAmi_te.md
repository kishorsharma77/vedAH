Ge (followed by Klein, DGRV I.242, II.108) takes pāda c as a subordinated conditional clause with d, with the subordination marked by ca (i.e., “if you will be my comrade, then we will …”). This is certainly possible, but it is impossible to tell formally if c is subordinated to d or coordinated with b (as I take it) because the accent on the verb ásaḥ can result from its initial position. Perhaps in favor of the Ge/Klein interpretation is the fact that both c and d contain subjunctives, while b has an imperative. On the other hand, in a related passage (also adduced by Ge), the two expressions are parallel, not in a subordinate/main clause relation: X.83.7 … dakṣiṇató bhavā me, ádhā vṛtrā́ṇi jaṅghanāva bhū́ri “Be on my right side.

Then we two will keep smiting obstacles in abundance.”
