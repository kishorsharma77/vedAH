The frogs’ release and fertilization of masses of eggs in the preceding vs. serves as a model for the fertility and increase of the ritualists that are major aims in Vedic rituals. This is surely the sense conveyed by the final vs. of the hymn, describing various types of frogs as “giving” goods and hundreds of cows to us, as well as lengthening both their and our lifetimes. They do so “at a pressing of thousands,” which can literally refer to the release of the frogs’ eggs. The prodigious fertility of frogs (no matter what happens subsequent to the thousands of eggs produced) is an encouragement to our own..

The publ. tr. renders prá tiranta ā́yuḥ as “they lengthened (their / our) life.” But the verb is of course tirante, a present indic., out of sandhi and the tr. should be corrected to “lengthen.”
