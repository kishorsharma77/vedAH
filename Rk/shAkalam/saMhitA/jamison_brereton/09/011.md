Soma Pavamāna
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa
9 verses: gāyatrī
Much of this hymn consists of exhortations to the priests to perform their parts of  the soma preparation, interspersed with addresses to Soma to purify himself for  our benefit. Unlike the last few hymns attributed to the same poet, the language and  syntax present no difficulties, and there is almost no imagery or verbal figuration. It  is a no-nonsense production.
## 1
Sing to him, men, to the self-purifying drop,
as he seeks to attain the gods.
## 2
The Atharvan-priests have now mixed your milk with honey—
mixed the god for the god in seeking the gods.
## 3
Purify yourself as weal for our cow, weal for our people, weal for our  charger,
weal for our plants, o king. 4. Now, to the self-powerful brown one, to the ruddy one who touches  heaven,
to Soma, chant a song.
## 5
Purify the soma pressed with stones set in motion by the hands.
Rinse the honey in honey.
## 6
Just with homage approach it. Just with curds mix it.
Place the drop in Indra.
## 7
As the limitless smiter of foes, o Soma, purify yourself as weal for  our cow,
acting for the gods according to their desire.
## 8
You are poured around, Soma, for Indra to drink, for his exhilaration— perceiving thoughts as master of thought.
## 9
Self-purifying Soma, give us wealth and an abundance of heroes,
o drop, along with Indra as our yokemate.
