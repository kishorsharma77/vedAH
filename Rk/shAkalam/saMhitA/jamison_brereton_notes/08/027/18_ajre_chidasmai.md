The 2nd hemistich presents some niggling syntactic and lexical problems.

To start with the latter, by most interpr. ásredhantī is transitive (Ge “ohne Schaden anzurichten,” Re “sans causer de nuisance”). But the verb to which this negated participle belongs is consistently intransitive, meaning ‘fail’, not ‘cause to fail’, and though Gr glosses ásredhant- (and related stems) as transitive ‘nicht schädigend’, hence ‘heilsam’, all passages are compatible with intransitive ‘unfailing, unfaltering’.

Although in this particular case ‘not harming’ might be tempting, the point here must be that the missile should go to destruction without pause or deviation in its trajectory.

I am disturbed by the pleonastic pāda-final sā́, doubling initial eṣā́, as well as what looks like a self-contained clausette in which it is found: paró nú sā́. Neither Ge nor Re takes any notice of the oddly constructed c pāda; Ge takes c and d as independent clauses, while Re treats cd as a unified clause. My tr. tries to mirror the construction by taking asmāt … paró nú sā́as a parenthetical. I remain concerned about two things: 1) This is the only passage in which paráḥ seems to mean ‘far from’; other passages containing paráḥ + ABL. mean ‘beyond, other than’ (see also the 1st verse of the next hymn, VIII.28.1, with paráḥ ‘beyond’ without abl.). However, ‘far from X’ and ‘beyond X’ are close enough semantically to allay my concerns, and in fact a tr. “it is now beyond him” would work fine. 2) I do not like the position of asmāt, but I must assume that it was extracted from the paró nú sā́clausette in order to conform to the pattern set in pāda a: x x cid asmai matched by c: x x cid asmāt.

I have reluctantly rendered cid in c as ‘also’ (so also Ge), though it does not match the two cids in a and b (‘even’) because I cannot make ‘even’ work. (I suppose “even this missile …” is possible, but it is not favored.)
