I take the pf. part. jujuṣāṇáḥ as expressing an action anterior to that of the main verb, impv. upā́gahi. If this is correct, the verse is constructed chiastically, with imáṃ yajñám construed with upā́gahi, while the call that precedes Soma’s arrival at the sacrifice is nested in between (idáṃ váco, jujuṣānáḥ).
