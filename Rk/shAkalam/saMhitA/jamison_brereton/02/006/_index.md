Agni
Somāhuti Bhārgava
8 verses: gāyatrī
There is nothing particularly striking in this hymn, which treats the usual themes  of our ritual service to Agni and the rewards we expect in turn. But it is deftly done and economically expressed in the short gāyatrī meter, with patterned repetitions  perceptible even in translation (see, e.g., vss. 1, 3, 5). The final two verses present  the common image of Agni as envoy and messenger between the human and divine  worlds.
