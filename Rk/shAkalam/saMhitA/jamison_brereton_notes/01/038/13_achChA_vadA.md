I have tr. jarā́yai as ‘to awaken him’, but this is probably wrong, however appealing in context. The noun jarā́- only means ‘old age’, and therefore some version of Ge’s “dass er das Greisenalter (uns schenke)” is better. Its intent would match the last pāda of the previous hymn, I.37.15c “in order (for us) to live a full lifetime,” and the two hymns have much in common.
