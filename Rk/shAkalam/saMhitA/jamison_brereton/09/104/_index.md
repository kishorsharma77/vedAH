Soma Pavamāna
Parvata Kāṇva and Nārada Kāṇva, or the two Apsarases named Śikhaṇḍinī, daugh ters of Kaśyapa
6 verses: uṣṇih
This hymn forms a close pair with 105 and the two are a textbook demonstration  of how R̥gvedic poets generate variations on underlyingly identical lexical and the matic material. The two hymns correspond verse by verse, and even in translation  the identity of many of the words, their grammatical forms, and whole phrases is  clear. But the poets avoid pāda-length repetitions and introduce variation via lexical  replacement or grammatical transformation.
The contents are unremarkable; both hymns deploy the usual soma-hymn tropes,  though the final apotropaic verse is refreshingly vivid.
