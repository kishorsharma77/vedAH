As noted in the publ. intro., this preliminary vs., preceding the apparently unconnected series of enumerative vss. calling on various gods, esp. female divinities and the wives of the gods, sets up the scenario: in pāda a the poet-sacrificer has yoked himself to the chariot pole (dhúr-) along with his wife, the recently introduced ritual Patnī, an image found elsewhere for the same pairing. Since dhúr- is feminine, the remaining feminines in this vs. (b tā́m … pratáranīm avasyúvam, c: asyāḥ) can refer both to the chariot pole and to the Patnī. In b the feminine obj. is said to be “furthering (the sacrifice)”; though the default obj. of prá √tṝ is ā́yus- ‘lifetime’, yajñám can also serve as obj.: cf., e.g., III.17.2 yajñám prá tira. (On avasyúvam see comm. ad vs. 7 below. One might also note that, while ‘seeking help’ makes sense in context, esp. when read with vs. 7, this word could also be taken as a phonological scrambling of ā̛yus-.) In c the speaker asserts that he does not wish to revert to the old ways or be released from the yoked pairing. In other words, he has accepted the ritual innovation of the Patnī.

Most interpr. take patháḥ as gen. sg. with vidvā́n. Since that pf. part. is generally used absolutely (“[as] knowing one”), I take patháḥ rather as acc. pl. extent of space with néṣati. For a clear acc. of the path with néṣa- see I.91.1 tváṃ rájiṣṭham ánu neṣi pánthām.
