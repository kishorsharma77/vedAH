Since Pūṣan is the god who sends the cows home and watches over paths and journeys in general, it is entirely appropriate that he should “make [various objects] reach their goal” (sādhaya), including our thought. Cf. in the first Pūṣan hymn of this cycle, VI.53.4 sā́dhantām … no dhíyaḥ “Let our poetic visions reach their goal.”
