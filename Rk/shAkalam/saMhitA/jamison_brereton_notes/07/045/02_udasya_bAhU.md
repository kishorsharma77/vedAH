Both Ge and Re take the aor. injunc. paniṣṭa in c as modal, but the aor.

injunc. ánu dāt in d as general pres. (e.g., “Jetzt sei … gepriesen; … ordnet …”). But there is no reason that the first needs to be assigned modal value: the temporal adv.

nūnám can instead draw attention to an immediate past action (“has [just] been wondered at”). And it seems preferable, if contextually possible, to take the two adjacent aor. injunctives in the same value.
