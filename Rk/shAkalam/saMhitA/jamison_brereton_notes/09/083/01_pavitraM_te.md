As indicated in the publ. intro. and above, ad IX.73.9, this vs. is very like the last vs. of IX.73, a hymn also focused on the filter, both physical and mystical.

The identity of the ‘limbs’ (gā́trāṇi) in b is not entirely clear. I take it as referring to the metaphorical limbs of the filter, though the visual picture thus conjured up is imperfect, unless the fleece filter comes not only from the back but from the legs of the sheep. I do not think it is the limbs of the soma-drinkers, with Re.

I take tád in c to be the filter, again both physical and mystical. As I say in the publ. intro., “raw” versus “cooked” in this hemistich refers to the transformation effected on the soma plant by its ritual preparation, even though “cooking” is not technically involved. The pl. in d is presumably the soma drops or drinks, as opposed to the mass sg. in c referring to the as-yet-unprepared plant.
