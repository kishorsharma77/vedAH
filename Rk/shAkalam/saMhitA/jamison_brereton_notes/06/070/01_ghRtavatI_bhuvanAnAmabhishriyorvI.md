pṛthvī́here (and in the same phrase in 4c) is of course a blindingly obvious pun: though used as an adj. here (‘broad’) it is of course (almost) identical to the standard word for ‘earth’, found in the dual dvandva dyā́vā-pṛthivī́in the next pāda (also 4a, 5a). By an accident of grammar, the nom./acc. dual fem. (in pṛthvī́, here modifying the dual dvandva) and the nom. singular. fem. pṛthivī́‘earth’ have the same ending -ī́. This grammatical pun is only actualized fully in the final vs. of the hymn, where we get the conjoined singular NP dyaúś ca pṛthivī́ca.
