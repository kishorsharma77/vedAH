The first pāda lacks a syllable, which can be restored by reading augmented avasiṣṭa. In the position after the final -o of hinvānó, the Saṃhitā text could have applied abhinihita sandhi to initial a redactionally, but the transmitted text never acquired an avagraha. This solution was already noted by Gr and endorsed by Old; Hoffmann discusses it extensively (Injunk. 147).
