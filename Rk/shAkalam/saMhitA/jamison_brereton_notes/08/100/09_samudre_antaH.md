The poet now plays another trick. The first pāda “within the sea he/it lies” (samudré antáḥ śayate) returns us to the Vṛtra myth and, we would think, to Vṛtra, who, in the most famous treatment of the myth, I.32, lies (√śi, Vṛtra’s signature verb there) submerged in water after his smiting (e.g., I.32.8 … amuyā́śáyānam … áti yanty ā́paḥ “The waters go across him lying in that way”). Here we have both the signature verb and the water - but it’s the vájra that is lying in the water, not Vṛtra, as we discover in the next pāda. Moreover, in that pāda the mace is ‘covered’ (abhī́vṛtaḥ) with water, using the same root (at least synchronically, whatever its source) as the transitive verb expressing Vṛtra’s obstruction of the waters in 7b (ávīvarīt). Both forms of course also evoke Vṛtra himself, “obstruction” embodied.

As far as I know, this image of the submerged mace receiving tribute from the waters is found nowhere else in the Vṛtra myth complex, and seems to have been invented here for the purpose of verbal trickery.
