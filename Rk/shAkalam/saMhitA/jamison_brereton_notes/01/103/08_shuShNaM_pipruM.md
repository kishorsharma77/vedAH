kúyava- ‘bringing bad harvest’ is ordinarily an epithet of Śuṣṇa, and I so take it here even though it is separated from śúṣṇam by another PN. I ascribe this position to the fact that kúyava- always appears after the caesura. However, in the next hymn (104.3) Kuyava seems to be an independent personage, or rather there is no overt mention of Śuṣṇa -- so perhaps he should be accorded an independent existence here as well (with the standard tr.).
