Ge takes bráhma as an abstract “Hohepriesterschaften,” standing for the personal pl. brahmā́ṇaḥ (n. 1a). I see no reason to take bráhma in any sense other than its usual ‘sacred formulation(s)’ (pl. in this instance)(nor does Schmidt, who tr.

“Wann werden die Gedichte ihren Sitz auf dem Wagen haben?” [152]). The vs. concerns the exchange of priestly praise for material goods bestowed by the god: the clothing of our praise with Indra’s wealth (c) and the bejeweling of our insights with his prizes (d) are vivid metaphors. The first pāda contains a likewise striking image: the chariots in which our formulations take up their position are presumably the chariot(s) Indra gives us, which will also be heaped with goods. It is our production of the formulations that brings the chariots. The intent of this image is made clearer by vs. 3b viśvápsu bráhma kṛṇávaḥ.

Both bhuvan and dāḥ are subjunctives, or at least have subjunctive function.

Contra Hoffmann (246), I am inclined to take dāḥ as a real subjunctive (<*dā-a-s), though without metrical distraction, not an injunctive, while both of us take bhuvan as subj. here.
