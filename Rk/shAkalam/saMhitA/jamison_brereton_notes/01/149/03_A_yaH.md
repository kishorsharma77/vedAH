nā́rmiṇīm in pāda a is a hapax. Ge and Re take it as a place name qualifying púram ‘stronghold’: Ge “die Burg Nārmiṇī.” This is of course a safe choice, but the fact that the pāda lacks a syllable and that each of the other pādas contains a simile marked by ná invite a reading ná ármiṇīm “the/an ármiṇī- like a stronghold.” This possibility was already noted by Old (SBE). I suggested that it is derived from arma(ká)- ‘flatland’ (see also Gr s.v. nā́rmin-); the same deriv. must underlie WG “der wie auf eine verödete Palisade leuchtete,” with the meaning ‘ruined place’ attributed by some to arma(ká)-. If such a derivation is accepted, a few questions arise. First, -in-stems are always accented on that suffix, as are the -ī-stems that serve as their feminines (cf. garbhínī- ‘pregnant’). Hence we should expect ná

*armíṇīm. This might be easily solved by assuming the second accent was lost when
nā́rmíṇīm was re-interpreted as a single word. The second question is why we need a feminine in the first place. There are several possibilities: 1) *armíṇī refers to something inherently feminine; 2) it has been “attracted” into the fem. by fem. púrin the simile; 3) púraṃ ná *armíṇīm is to be interpr. as a single unit (with WG) “illuminated as if (illuminating) an armín- stronghold.” If *armín- does mean ‘having flatland, low-lying’ or the like, the third possibility is not likely, because of the discrepancy in meanings (strongholds/fortresses presumably generally have commanding sites) -- though other proposed senses of the word might be more compatible with ‘stronghold’.

Although problems remain with nā́rmiṇīm, like many hapaxes it participates in phonetic play: note b nā́rvā, read ná árvā and 2a narā́m ná r-.
