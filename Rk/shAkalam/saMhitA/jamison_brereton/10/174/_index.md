Praise of the King  
Abhīvarta Āṅgirasa  
5 verses: anuṣṭubh  
A companion piece to the preceding consecration hymn, but one that focuses only  on the combative and confrontational aspects of kingship. Here the signature idiom  is abhí-√vr̥t “roll over,” again providing the Anukramaṇī’s poet’s name. The king’s  ability to “roll over” and crush his opponents as Indra did, leaving him the only one  standing, is celebrated and ritually effected with an oblation named with the idiom  and associated with Indra (vss. 1, 4).
