Dawn
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas This final hymn breaks the pattern of the other Dawn hymns in this series: it has  too many verses for its position; it is composed of three pragāthas of br̥hatī alter nating with satobr̥hatī (as opposed to the triṣṭubh meter of the other hymns); and  it lacks the Vasiṣṭha clan refrain. It is therefore likely to have been an addition to  the collection, and the 1st-person plural subjunctive bhunájāmahai in verse 5 with  the modernized -mahai ending supports this assumption. However, the themes and  concerns of the hymn and the phraseology employed do not differ significantly  from those that went before.
