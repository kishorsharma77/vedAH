The Pp. interprets paramá as nom. sg. m. paramáḥ, and Ge (/WG) follow suit. I prefer the equally possible reading paramé, on the basis of several ‘born’ passages with this expression. Cf., e.g., I.143.2 sá jā́yamānaḥ paramé vyòman (though the subj. is Agni there).

In my view cid often takes Wackernagel’s Law position, even when it seems to limit a different word in the clause. Hence my “even the gods,” though devā́(ḥ) is at the end of the pāda. Its positioning there may be to take advantage of its adjacency to víśvā(ḥ) across the pāda boundary. Although the latter is fem. and must modify acc. pl. apáḥ ‘waters’, its position evokes the common locution “all the gods / the All Gods.” In fact, the expression “all the waters” is vanishingly rare — besides this passage I have found only VII.95.1 — and so “all” belongs more naturally with the immediately preceding “gods” than with its grammatical partner.

Note the switch from 2nd ps. ref. to Indra (rel. cl. 5ab) to 3rd ps. ref. (main cl.

5c, new cl. 5d).
