Pāda b seems to mix two kinds of expressions of purpose: the datival infinitive (śárdhāya vītáye) and a clause introduced by yáthā, in which we expect a subjunctive. In the absence of such a verb, the yáthā appears pleonastic. The next pāda begins the same way, with yáthā followed by a dative referring to gods (mitrā́ya váruṇāya). The datival gods appear to be exactly parallel to śárdhāya in b, and we would expect vītáye to follow as there, or at least be supplied. But instead we find the nom. śáṃtamaḥ, which suggests that the yáthā in this pāda should be taken seriously and we should supply a subjunctive: “so that he (will be) most wealful for M+V.” (The publ. tr. renders b and c as more parallel than they are and should perhaps be changed.)
