Gr̥tsamada
21 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 16–17, and br̥hatī 18, arranged in trcas ̥
This is a composite hymn:  its composite nature is clear from its position in the  maṇḍala, for with twenty-one verses it is far longer than the preceding hymn, which  contains six. The hymn has been assembled from the three-verse units known as  tr̥cas. It is also of mixed meter, though gāyatrī prevails for most of the hymn (vss.  1–15 and 19–21).
Nonetheless, with the exception of the final three verses (19–21), the hymn forms  a ritual unity, treating in order the gods addressed in a structured recitation form ing part of the Morning Pressing, which is found also in later Vedic śrauta ritual,  known as the Praügaśastra. Other instantiations of this recitation in the Ṛgveda are  found in I.2–3 (see remarks there) and I.23. The order of divinities is Vāyu (1–2),  Indra-Vāyu (3), Mitra-Varuṇa (4–6), Aśvins (7–9), Indra (10–12), the All Gods (13– 15), Sarasvatī (16–18). The last three verses (19–21) are, according to Oldenberg  (1888: 197 and n. 4), an independent tr̥ca, relating to the carts holding the oblation  (havirdhāna carts), that was mistakenly incorporated into the hymn. Even if this last  tr̥ca was a late addition, it is worth noting that the first and last verses of the hymn  end with the word sómapītaye “for soma-drinking,” forming at least a nominal ring.
