The verb in c, namasyā́, can be either 2nd sg. impv. or 1st sg. subj., and translations differ. Because of the surrounding 1st ps. verbs (b: 1st sg. īrayāmi, d: 1st pl. gṛṇīmási) I opt for the 1st sg. subjunctive, though there are no implications either way. kalmalīkín- is obviously a possessive -ín-stem built to a -ka-suffixed form of kalmalí-, found once in the AV (XV.2.1-4) in unclear meaning, as descriptor of a jewel. The l’s and the reduplicative rhyming formation (kal-mal-) mark it as nonstandard and suggest that it is affective in some fashion. My tr. “sparkling one” is similar to those of others, but given the uncertainty of the word and its base, it should have been marked with a question mark.
