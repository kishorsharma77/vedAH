All Gods
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
15 verses: triṣṭubh, except virāḍrūpā 5–6
This hymn is divided almost equally between praise and invocation to a variety of  gods (vss. 1–6) and a complex dānastuti (vss. 7–15). As is true of all of Kakṣīvant’s  oeuvre there are many twists and turns along the way. The part devoted to the  gods seems to define an early-morning sacrifice in its first verses, especially those  calling on Dawn and Night (vs. 2), the Wind as well as Indra (vs. 3), and the  Aśvins and Agni (vs. 4), though Rudra and the Maruts (vs. 1), Pūṣan (vs. 5), and,  especially, Mitra and Varuṇa (vss. 6–7, 9) also appear. An early-morning ritual284 I.122
is appropriate for the following dānastuti, since the priestly gifts (dakṣiṇās) are  distributed then.
The dānastuti is filled with personal names, and, as often, it is difficult to disen tangle the relationships among them. In fact it appears that we may be dealing with  competing potential patrons, each praised for a fleeting moment for his generosity  until a larger prize from a different patron is in the offing. In verse 12 the poet seems  to be inviting this competition, promising to act as a kind of kingmaker for whom ever he gets as patron, and in the difficult verse 13 the poet may be suggesting that  patrons with goods to offer are attempting to surpass competing patrons with their  largesse. This interpretation remains uncertain, however.
