As Ge suggests (in n. 3 to his n. to 4ab), the apparent pleonastic doubling of the simile particle (ráthaṃ ná tā́ṣṭā-iva) may instead signal that two images have been crossed here: one with a simplex hinomi (“I impel the praise like a chariot”) and the other with sáṃ hinomi and the addition of the carpenter as subject (“I, like a carpenter, put together praise, like a chariot”).
