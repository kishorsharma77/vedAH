The publ. tr. “does … follows” should be corrected to “follow.” I don’t know why Varuṇa, the Aśvins, and the Maruts -- gods that don’t usually interact -- appear together as followers of Viṣṇu’s krátu-. Syntactically it is mildly interesting that a singular nom. (váruṇaḥ) and a dual nom. (aśvínā) together form the subject of a plural verb (sacanta). By simple addition this is what we would expect, but verb agreement often is governed by more local rules.

I do not understand the second hemistich either. Part of the problem is the cmpd. ahar-víd- ‘knowing (or finding) the days’. I interpret it in light of the last verse of the previous hymn, I.155.6, concerning Viṣṇu’s apparent control over the days of the year. Since Viṣṇu is several times in this hymn (including in this vs.) called védhas- ‘ritual expert’ (2a, 4b, 5c), the reference may be rather to knowing the ritual day, as in I.2.2. But others see pāda d as depicting the Vala myth, and WG interpr. aharvíd- in this Vala context: “das Tageslicht zu finden.”
