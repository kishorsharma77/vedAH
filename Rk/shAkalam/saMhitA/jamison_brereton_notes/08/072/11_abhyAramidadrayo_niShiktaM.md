The hapax abhyā́ram is glossed by Gr “zur Hand, bereit,” and Ge and Re follow suit. Old suggests that it’s an absolutive, without specifying to what root or what it should mean. Still I think he has a better chance of being right than the others.

The -am gerund takes vṛddhi of the root and accent on the root syllable (see, e.g., Whitney Gr. §995, and AV abhyākrā́mam). This form could well belong to abhí √ṛ (as in fact Gr also suggest) and mean ‘going towards’.
