Indra and Varuṇa Pace Old, I do not think this consists of two (much less three) hymns, with 1-8 forming one, 9-11, or 9, 10-11, one or two more. As indicated in the publ. intro., the last three vss. focus on the ritual here-and-now, but this topic-switch from praise and request to ritual exhortation is easily accommodated within the same hymn. That 9- 10 are in Jagatī in contrast to the Triṣṭubh in the rest of the hymn is not sufficient to signal a hymn break, esp. since 9-10 doesn’t match either of Old’s suggested groupings.
