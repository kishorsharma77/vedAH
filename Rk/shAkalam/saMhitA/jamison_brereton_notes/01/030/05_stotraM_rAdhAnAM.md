The word order of ab is rather tortured. The clause is simply a nominal sentence forming a relative clause, but the relative pronoun phrase yásya te, instead of appearing in 2nd or modified position after pāda-initial stotrám as is overwhelmingly common (see, e.g., modified 2nd in 2a śatáṃ vā yáḥ … above), comes at the very end of the hemistich, separated from its noun by three vocative phrases, which take up the rest of pāda a and most of pāda b: … rādhānām pate, gírvāho vīra .... This still counts as 2nd position since the vocc. are extra-syntactic, but the poet is cheekily pushing the limits. The te is simply there to indicate that the rel.

pron. has 2nd ps. reference, which is of course not syntactically coded onto the relative. Cf. the common phrase táṃ tvā (e.g., 10a below), where the 2nd ps. pronoun has the same function: to give 2nd ps. ref. to the demonstrative.
