The first hemistich contains two hapaxes with which Indra is identified.

The meaning and etymology of neither of them can be certainly determined.

The first one, mṛkṣá-, is the easier, because a root etymology suggests itself (though without imposing itself) and because the adjective qualifying it, áśvya- ‘belong to a horse, equine’, narrows the semantic field. If the form belongs to the root √mṛj ‘wipe, groom’, a mṛkṣá- can be a curry comb (so Ge, EWA s.v. MARJ, both with uncertainty) or other tool for grooming a horse. (The supposed root √mrakṣ ‘comb’ to which Gr and AiG II.2.71 assign it does not exist.) Possibly connected is the hapax mrk̥ ṣínī- (X.98.6), where the word seems to describe the tracks on the earth made by a hard rain - possibly envisioned as the regularly spaced impressions left by a comb. Why calling Indra a curry comb would be flattering to the god is not clear. Perhaps it’s one of those cultural mysteries like (semi-)modern Engl. “you’re the cat’s pajamas.” Or perhaps, like the farm implement the harrow, which likewise has teeth and is pulled across land to break up clods, etc., and which has developed in English into a verb expressing the infliction of distress, the curry comb can be conceived of as a weapon.

The second hapax, kī́ja-, is harder, because there is no apparent root etymology, no similar forms attested in the RV, and, although it is also accompanied by an adjective, that particular adj. ‘golden’ (hiraṇyáya-) leaves the field very wide.

Note also that, properly speaking, the velar should have yielded a palatal before ī, but there are enough secondary ki/ī forms to keep this from being a useful diagnostic. Ge suggests, tentatively, “Sporn” (spur) (sim., and similarly tentative, EWA), but gives no support. I very hesitantly adduce the later (Ep+) kīcaka- ‘hollow bamboo’ and suggest that kī́ja might be a ‘stake’. Note the hiraṇyáyo vetasáḥ “golden reed” in IV.58.5. Being called a golden stake seems a bit better than being a horse’s curry comb.
