The root √īś overwhelmingly takes the gen.; the construction here is identified by Gr (s.v. īś, col. 236: #8 mit dem Acc.) as mixed: the gen. yā́vataḥ is construed with the implied 2nd ps. “as much as you are lord over” (yā́vatas tvám [ī́śiṣe]) in pāda a, which is picked up by the acc. etā́vad in the contrary-to-fact “if I were lord over so much” (yád … etā́vad ahám ī́śiya). I think it more likely that etā́vad here is a quasi-adverbial summing up of the dependent clause; a more literal tr. would be “if I were lord to such an extent as” or the like. The other passages assembled under Gr’s #8 can be variously explained and do not provide strong evidence for an alternative case frame with √īś. In III.18.3 yā́vad is again adverbial; see the publ. tr. “inasmuch as I am master …” In VIII.68.7 ī́śe is properly construed with a gen. (kṛṣṭīnā́m) in its own pāda; the acc. cited by Gr, pūrvyā́m ánuṣṭutim in the previous pāda, is probably an acc. of respect (see comm. ad loc.) For nearby VII.37.7 as well as III.51.4, the latter cited only as a possibility by Gr., see comm. ad locc.
