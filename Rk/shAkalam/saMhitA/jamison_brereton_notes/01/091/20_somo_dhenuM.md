Ge (/WG) takes the final phrase of d yó dádāśad asmai as expressing the indirect object with dadāti in b (“gives [to him,] who …”), rather than as a qualification of vīrám (or even of pitṛ-, as Re almost seems to). I think this is correct, but it is mildly disturbing that there is no overt expression of the datival recipient in the main clause; we would expect tásmai (see Ge’s n. 20d). It may have been gapped because of the asmai in the rel. clause. Note that asmai cannot be a part of the main clause and refer to the indirect object, the man who does pious service, because it is unaccented; it must be part of the rel. cl. and refer to Soma.
