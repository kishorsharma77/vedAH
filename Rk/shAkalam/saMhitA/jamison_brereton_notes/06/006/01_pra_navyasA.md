The subject of this vs. is not overtly expressed, but it cannot be Agni, who is the acc. goal. Re cleverly suggests that the subject is indicated by the participle gṛṇánt- ‘singing, singer’ in the last pāda of this hymn. If so, this is an oblique form of ring composition.

Contrary to my usual principles, rather than construing návyasā with yajñéna in the next pāda (so Ge, Re), I supply a form of ‘speech’. I do so on the grounds that návyas-, particularly in the instr., is specialized to the realm of speech. Cf. návyasā vácasā (VI.62.5) as well as the famous pāda-final disharmonious formula návyasā vácaḥ (II.31.5, VI.48.11, VIII.39.2), along with fem. forms of the comparative with different ‘speech, thought’ words (e.g., nearby VI.8.1 matír návyasī).

The hapax vṛścád-vana- ‘hewing wood’ shows the poet’s penchant for the type of cmpd. that provides his name, Bharád-vāja. Cf. also ṛdhád-vāra- in VI.3.2.
