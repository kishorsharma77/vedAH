The placement of árvantam amid the pieces of tackle associated with him seems strange at first, but in fact it can be seen as iconic: these various items hold him, and so he’s surrounded by them. It’s also clever that the various things are in the neuter, and so it is not till the verb appears (ā́yāmayanti at the very end of the vs.) that it becomes clear that they are the subjects of the verb and therefore nominative, while árvantam is clearly accusative.
