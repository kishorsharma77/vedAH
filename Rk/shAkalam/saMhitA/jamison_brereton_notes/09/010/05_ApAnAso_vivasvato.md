On my view of the sense of this vs., see publ. intro. With Ge, I supply bhágam with the gen. vivásvataḥ in a, as well as with gen. uṣásaḥ in b; unlike Ge I take bhága- to mean ‘portion’ (not “das Glück”) and interpr. it as referring to the radiance of the two divinities, by which Soma transforms himself into the sun (or rather a set of suns -- the radiating golden color on the sheep’s fleece filter). Re’s interpr. is quite different: he supplies “la région” with vivásvataḥ, and takes uṣásaḥ as an acc. pl., parallel to bhágam and both as names of divinities (“engendrant les Aurores (et) Bhaga”). For the former he must be thinking of the common expression sádane vivásvataḥ “in the seat of V,” but that expression is only in the loc. and never found in IX. As for the latter, even with his explanatory n. I don’t how this improves the sense of the vs. ### 06
“The raging of the bull” must refer to the headlong journey of the soma as it is being purified, which is set in motion and accompanied by the recitation of ritual poetry -- hence the violent opening of “the doors of poetic thoughts” (dvā́rā matīnā́m). The continuity of the poetic tradition from the pratnā́ḥ (‘ancient’) bards to the current ones is suggested by the use of the pres. ṛṇvanti. I do not think, with Ge (n. 6ab), that pratná- gives the present tense verb a preterital sense, and indeed in IX.73.3 pítā … pratnó abhí rakṣati Ge tr. the pres. rakṣati with the pres. “wacht,” not a preterite.
