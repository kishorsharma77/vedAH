The two versions are closer together than the last few verses: 49a ugráṃ ná vīrám / 50a prá vīrám ugrám / b: víbhūtim / c: udrī́va vajrinn avató. In addition 49b has -vasum and 50c vasutvanā́, and 49d is almost identical to 50.4b.

I supply árcā on the basis of prá and vs. 1, but any verb of praising or the like will do.
