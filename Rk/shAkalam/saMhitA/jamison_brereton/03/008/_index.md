Sacrificial Post(s)  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 3, 7  
Though this hymn is found in the middle of the Agni collection, it is dedicated  to the Sacrificial Post (yūpa), to which the animal to be sacrificed is tied. It is not  entirely clear why it has been inserted here, though as an eleven-verse hymn con sisting mostly of triṣṭubhs it comes at the end of the triṣṭubh hymns to Agni and is  preceded by two likewise eleven-verse hymns.  
The structure of the hymn has been illuminatingly discussed by Theodore Proferes  (2003b), who shows that not only does it fall into two separate parts devoted to the  single post (1–5) and multiple posts (6–10) respectively, as is already indicated by the  Anukramaṇī, but that the two halves are entirely parallel in phraseology and struc  
ture. Originally there were probably two hymns, each appropriate to a different ritual  situation (one sacrificial animal versus several). They were put together and a final  benedictory verse was added (11), and then it was inserted into the Agni cycle.  
The ritual action depicted in both parts is the erecting, anointing, and wrapping  of the posts; there is no mention of the sacrificial animal.
