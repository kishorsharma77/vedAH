Note the playful úditā … níditā véditā, already pointed to by Old, in which the three rhyming words are grammatically entirely different: fem. loc. sg., neut. acc. pl., and masc. nom. sg. agent noun respectively.

What is being compared to the waves (ūrmáyaḥ) in c? Ge supplies “Absichten” (intentions), presumably on the basis of dhiyā́in d, but the dhī́- of Agni should not be considered negative or hostile. Re’s suggestion, “flames,” is far more persuasive, but I think this idea should be combined with Old’s view that ūrmáyaḥ belongs with both simile and frame. That is, Agni’s flames are already metaphorically waves and then can be compared with real waves. Cf. the cmpd descriptor of Agni in I.58.45 rúśadūrmi- ‘possessing gleaming waves’.
