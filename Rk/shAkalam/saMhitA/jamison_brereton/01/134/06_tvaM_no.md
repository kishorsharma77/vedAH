You, Vāyu, with no one ahead, have first right to the drinking of these  soma drinks of ours—you have the right to the drinking of these
pressings.
And of the clans with their vying oblations who have twisted (you
toward them)—
all their milk-cows have milked out the milk-mixture for you—have  milked out the ghee and the milk-mixture.
