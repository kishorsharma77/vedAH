Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
8 verses: gāyatrī 1–4; triṣṭubh 5, 7–8; jagatī 6
This hymn is also an addition to the Indra collection. Entirely parallel to III.28 (a  hymn to Agni), it concerns the offering of a sacrificial cake at each pressing of the  soma sacrifice, with each pressing characterized by a different meter. The Morning  Pressing is the subject of verses 1–4; the Midday Pressing (amply represented in  other hymns of this cycle: see the introduction to III.51) merits only one verse (5),  and the Third Pressing is likewise mentioned only once (vs. 6). The remaining two  verses appear to have a more general application.
## 1
(The soma) accompanied by roasted grain, by gruel, by cakes,
by hymns—
Indra, enjoy (this soma) of ours early in the morning.
## 2
The cooked offering cake—enjoy it, Indra, and welcome it.
To you do the oblations flow.
## 3
Our offering cake you shall eat, and you shall take pleasure in
our songs,
as a bride-seeking man does a maiden.

## 4
Enjoy our offering cake at the Morning Pressing.
O Indra famed of old, lofty indeed is your resolve.
## 5
The roasted grains of the Midday Pressing, the offering cake—Indra,  make them your own dear (possessions) here,
when the praiser, the singer, (going) forth swift to his task, acting the  bull, reverently invokes you with hymns.
## 6
At the Third Pressing, our roasted grains, our offering cake bepoured  (with ghee)—grant them to yourself, much-praised one.
Might we, dispensing ritual delights, entice you here with our hymnic  visions, o poet—you accompanied by the R̥bhus, provided with
prizes.
## 7
We made gruel for you who are accompanied by Pūṣan, roasted grains  for you of the fallow bay horses, accompanied by your fallow bays.
Eat the cake; in joint throng with the Maruts drink the soma, o hero, as  Vr̥tra-smasher and knowing one.
## 8
Bring the roasted grains swiftly toward him, the offering cake for the  most virile of men.
Every day there are (roasted grains) with the same appearance for you,  Indra. Let them strengthen you for soma-drinking, daring one.
