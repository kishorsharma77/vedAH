The first hemistich, which contains both suṣṭutí- ‘good praise’ and a form of √juṣ ‘enjoy’ with the Maruts as subject, but in separate clauses is an expansion of 3b jújoṣann ín marútaḥ suṣṭutíṃ naḥ. As was noted above, the first pāda of 3 also contains a pl. form of maghávan(t)-, which I take there as referring to our human patrons, because I take the Maruts as subject of the 2nd pl. impv., but the presence of maghónām here, clearly referring to the Maruts, may instead suggest that the maghávant-s in 3a are also the Maruts. 94 idám in b (idáṃ sūktám) is yet another example of the frequent use of a form of ayám in the last vs. of a hymn to refer to the whole preceding hymn.
