This verse contains no main clause, just two different subordinate clauses introduced by yé (ab) and yád (cd) respectively, with the first couched in the 3rd ps., the second in the 2nd ps. Although such switches of person in the middle of a verse are far from rare in the RV (see in fact vs. 5), in this case it seems best to consider the first half of this verse a pendant to vs. 3 (also in the 3rd ps.) and the second half an anticipation of vs. 5 (also in the 2nd ps.), esp. since 5a is an abbreviated duplicate of 4cd.

The adj. manojúvaḥ ‘mind-swift’ could equally well be a nom. pl. masc.

modifying the Maruts or an acc. pl. fem. modifying pṛ́ṣatīḥ. Most tr. opt for the latter, I think correctly on thematic grounds, but grammatically and semantically either is possible. Gr and Macd (Vedic Reader) take it as a nominative; certainly its position right before marutaḥ in pāda a, with pŕṣatīḥ appearing only in the middle of the second pāda, suggests that the initial audience interpretation would be as a modifier of the Maruts.
