I am not certain of the referent of asya in pāda a. Ge and Re seems to interpr.

it as Soma, implicitly dependent on máda-, which they take to be the referent of tám, on the basis of mádo yáḥ in b. I see the point, and it would solve the asya problem.

But I have several objections. First, the object of √mṛj ‘groom’ is unlikely to be exhilaration or the exhilarating drink (máda-) conceived of as separate from Soma him/itself. Moreover, in the central part of this hymn, vss. 3-5, each vs. begins with tám, and I find it difficult to believe that this tám has a different referent from the other two, which refer to Soma. And finally, vss. 6-7 each begin with sá, again referring to Soma, and in 7 sá is the subj. of mṛjyate ‘is groomed’, the passive version of our tám … marjayāmasi “we groom him.” For all these reasons I think tám must be Soma, with mádaḥ in b equated with him. In this case asya can only refer to Vivasvant, who is the only other singular entity previously mentioned.

The 2nd hemistich contains a striking conceptual reversal: the “cows” suck soma, though ordinarily it is the (conceptual) calf that sucks its mother, the cow. This may accompany another conceptual reversal: in IX “cows” are almost always a reference to the milk mixture added to the soma, but here Ge (n. 3cd) plausibly suggests that here they are the pressing stones, sucking the soma out of the plant stalks.

On the configuration of pāda d see Klein, DGRV I.95-96.
