Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
11 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 11
This is a good example of a hymn driven almost entirely by rhetoric. The organizing  principle of the hymn is the careful stationing of an accented form of the name indra ́ at the beginning of the third pāda (after the hemistich break) in eight of the first nine  verses. The middle verse of this sequence (vs. 5) instead has indra ́ at the beginning  of the verse, and this slight deviation from pattern marks an unemphatic omphalos.  As often in R̥gvedic hymnic composition, a pattern set through most of the hymn is  both broken and advanced at the end. Verse 10 seems at first to announce the epiph
any of the god, which has been desired throughout the hymn; the name of the god  has been demoted to unaccented second position, after the annunciatory augmented  aorist, the only past tense form in a hymn full of imperatives and presents: “you  have come, Indra.” The poet has tricked us, however: Indra has come not to us but  to fame. The final verse (11) is in a different meter, often a sign of an extra-hymnic  verse, but it also emphatically renews the call for Indra’s epiphany and therefore pro
vides a fitting end to the rest. The name indra ́ opens the final pāda (11d). The “content” of the hymn is relatively conventional and clearly subordinate to  the rhetorical structure, but the light texture and balance of the phrases surround ing the all-important repeated name are quite pleasing.
