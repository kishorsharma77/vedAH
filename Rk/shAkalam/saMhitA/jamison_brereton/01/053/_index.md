Indra
Savya Āṅgirasa
11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10–11
This hymn is divided into two roughly equal halves. After an initial verse exhorting  the singers to present their work to Indra at the sacrifice, lest a lazy performance  or bad composition deprive them of his gifts, Indra is praised in verses 2–5 for his  quick response in fulfilling the desires of his singers. The mood changes in the next  five verses (6–10), which constitute a brisk catalogue of Indra’s martial deeds in  aid of his named human clients. This survey is somewhat reminiscent of the list of  Indra’s deeds in the first Savya hymn, I.51. The hymn ends with a summary verse  (11), which returns to the hortatory style of verse 1.
