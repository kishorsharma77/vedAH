It is appropriate that the “beestings” (pīyū́ṣa-), that is, the colostrum or first milk, should be given to the new-born Indra.

The preverb pári in pāda a is presumably to be construed with ā́siñcat in b, a verb with which it is frequently found. I do not understand the position of this pári, in the middle of the pāda, right after the caesura but breaking up the NP mātā́… yóṣā jánitrī.
