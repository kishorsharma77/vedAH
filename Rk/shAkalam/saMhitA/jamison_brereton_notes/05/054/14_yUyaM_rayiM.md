The problematic wealth of 13d reappears in 14a as the obj. of a gapped verb whose subj. is the Maruts, but in this case we can borrow the verb from the next pāda, avatha ‘you aid’. Ge unaccountably supplies a verb (“gewähret”) that matches neither what precedes nor what follows.

The pāda-final words in the first hemistich, … spārhávīram# and … sā́mavipram# are phonologically similar. This partial match may help explain the odd hapax sā́mavipra-. Although my tr. ‘inspired in his melody’ is structurally similar to the other standard renderings (e.g., Re ‘inspiré par la mélodie-sacreé’), the cmpd should not mean that. For one thing the 2nd member vípra- is almost never used adjectivally (pace Gr), but almost always as a noun referring to a type of poet.

Moreover, the accent strong suggests a bahuvrīhi. A literal rendering of such a bahuvrīhi would be something like ‘whose inspired poet is the melody’ or ‘whose inspired poet has the melody’ (latter like vájra-bāhu- ‘having an arm that has a mace (in it)’), which do not work as descriptors of a seer. I wonder if the phonological play just noted didn’t flip the order of the cmpd members, and the underlying form would be *vípra-sāman- ‘having the melody of an inspired poet’. Exact parallels are vípramanman- ‘having the thought of an inspired poet / having inspired thought’ in VI.39.1, where it modifies kaví-, and vípra-vacas- ‘having the speech of an inspired poet / having inspired speech’ in VIII.61.8.
