Indra in pāda a is identified with a large drinking vessel, in this vs. that emphasizes his size and capacity.

The b pāda begins and ends with etymologically related words: ugrám (adj.) and ójaḥ (noun), though each is part of a different NP.

As Kü demonstrates (503-6), the pf. of √vyac is always presential.
