Agni  
Ketu Āgneya  
5 verses: gāyatrī  
The ritual setting for this hymn is given in verses 4–5: the kindling of fire at sunrise.  The first three verses express the hope that this kindling of the fire will bring goods  to the ritual participants, an oblique reference to the distribution of the priestly  gifts at the Morning Pressing. This blatant desire for reward is somewhat camou  
flaged by couching it in terms of contests (vs. 1), cattle raids (vs. 2), and chariot  racing (vs. 3).
