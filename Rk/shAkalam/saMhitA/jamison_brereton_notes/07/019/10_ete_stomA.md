We might have expected an unaccented gen. pl. *narām in the voc. phrase with nṛtama, but don’t get it. There are no unaccented occurrences of this genitive. It would be possible instead to read narā́m with eté stómāḥ (“these praises of men”), but nṛ́tama- + gen. pl. of nṛ́- is a fixed phrase, though usually with nṛṇā́m (I.77.4, III.51.4, IV.25.4, etc.). I am now inclined to read narā́m with both stómā(ḥ) and nṛtama. It is positioned between them, adjacent to both. The publ. tr. could be modified to “These praises of men are for you, o most manly of men.” The first gen. is subjective. Note the co-occurrence of narā́m, the older gen. pl. to nṛ́-, and the newer one nṛṇā́m in this verse.

Ge takes b as an independent nominal clause, while I consider it a sort of definitional relative clause manqué, that is, lacking the relative pronoun yé which would find its referent in the initial téṣām of c.

Although d looks to contain a simple conjoined NP, each of whose members consists of two members, sákhā śū́raḥ and avitā́nṛṇā́m, each with a ca between the two members (so Ge, JSK I.195), I prefer to take śū́raḥ as the principal predication of Indra, with the other two terms, sákhā and avitā́nṛṇā́m, secondarily predicated of Indra as śū́ra-. Although this introduces a minor complication in word order, the fact that śū́ra- is overwhelmingly a noun and is used independently of Indra in the very next pāda (11a) persuades me that this analysis is correct, especially since both “comrade” and “helper of men” are terms that explicitly encode Indra’s relationship to men, while “champion” is of a different order. The distribution of ca’s makes no problems for this analysis.
