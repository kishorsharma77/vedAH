The standard interpr. (Old, Ge, Re) take the nom. pl. rel. yé of ab to be coreferential with the instr. sūríbhiḥ ‘with the patrons’ in c. This is certainly possible, but I follow Thieme (Fremd. 20) in taking it rather with the 1st pl. subj. of syāma in c, hence “(we) who …” There is no morphosyntactic way to tell, as the rel. cl. of ab has no finite verb, so the person of yé is unspecified. I favor “we” because cd seems to set up a contrastive pair of the two instr. pl. in c / d (sūríbhiḥ / nṛ́bhiḥ), with which we accomplish complementary feats: smashing obstacles along with the patrons (c), conquering in battle with the superior men (=warriors) (d). If the first hemistich refers exclusively to one of these instrumentals the rhetorical balance is disturbed.

I do not follow Thieme (Fremd. 20 n. 1) in accepting the old suggestion (conjectured by Gr; see Old for further lit.) that the Saṃhitā vāyáva should be taken as a nom. pl. vāyávaḥ, against Pp. dat. sg. vāyáve, as an adj. ‘serving Vāyu’ vel sim.

As Old points out, the dat. is supported by té vāyáve found twice in the preceding hymn (VII.91.1, 3), like our yé vāyave, and in any case the posited adjectival form would be morphologically dubious (see, e.g., Re’s remarks inter alia). Most supply another nom. pl. adj. to construe with dat. vāyáve; cf. Ge’s “die dem Vāyu (opfern),” Re’s “(étant) au (service de) Vāyu.” But I think this is unnecessary: I take the phrase vāyáva indramā́danāsaḥ as an example of the fungibility of compounds and free syntagms with the same structure. In other words, I would extract the √mad form from the cmpd and construe it also with dat. vāyáve. Although transitive forms of √mad generally take the acc., cf. IX.25.1 marúdbhyo vāyáve mádaḥ “exhilarating 116 (drink) for the Maruts and for Vāyu” and, with the same nominal form as here,
