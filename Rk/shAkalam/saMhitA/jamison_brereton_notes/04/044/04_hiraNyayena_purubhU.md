The root noun cmpd. purubhū́- can, of course, be interpreted in many ways, given its component parts. See disc. in Scar (362). Four of its five occurrences modify the Aśvins (and the fifth may not belong to this stem; seecomm. ad IX.94.3); since one of the oft-noted characteristics of the Aśvins is their peripatetic nature, I interpr. it as ‘appearing in many places’. In our passage it strikes the same note as ihéha ‘here and there’ in vs. 7 (=43.7). There are two occurrences in VIII.22 (vss. 3, 12), and the Aśvins hymns in VIII often express concern about the many places the Aśvins could be besides here.
