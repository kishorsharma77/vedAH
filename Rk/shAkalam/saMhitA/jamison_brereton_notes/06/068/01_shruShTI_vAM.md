Acdg. to Re, kárman- is esp. associated with Indra, íṣ- with Viṣṇu, but I see no clear evidence of this.

pārá- ‘far shore’ and pāráya- ‘cause to cross [to the far shore]’ are of course etymologically related, and here they express allied notions: just as we cause Indra and Viṣṇu to reach the ‘far shore’ of their labor, so do they cause us to cross something unspecified, but quite possibly the reference is to completing the ritual.
