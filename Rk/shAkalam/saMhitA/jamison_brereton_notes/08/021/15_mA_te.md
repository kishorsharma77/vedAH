Again the cultural content here is somewhat elusive and therefore the relation of the simile to the frame not entirely clear. The woman who grows old at home (amājúr-) must be a spinster (see II.17.7 for the clearest context of this word), but what aspect of her activity we wish to avoid isn’t defined. It may simply be that we should not sit still and inactive at the soma sacrifice when we should be busying ourselves serving Indra. (Although one wonders whether an ancient Indian spinster was allowed just to sit around, rather than being a virtual servant to her parents and the rest of the extended family. I would think she’d be busy enough.) Or perhaps there is a pun embedded in ní √sad; in later Sanskrit this lexeme can mean ‘sink down (mentally), be depressed’ and so perhaps it’s the spinster’s mental state that’s at issue. It is even possible, if we read this verse with its pragātha partner, vs. 16, to take “let us not miss out…” of 16a as a gloss on what aspect of the spinster’s life we wish to avoid in 15: she missed out on marriage, but we do not want to miss out on Indra’s gifts.
