The complementary etymological and morphological figure ávann ávantīḥ is noteworthy, but I have no idea what “helping/helpful doors”(ávantīr dúraḥ) are or do. Perhaps it is an indirect way to refer to the sacrificial offerings humans make to help the gods, in return for the help (etc.) they receive from the gods, in this case Rudra. As Re suggests ad loc. (EVP XV.161), “dúraḥ … s’oriente vers «maison»” and the emphasis in this vs. and the next on the protection of our children and offspring may have invited this allusion to the house.
