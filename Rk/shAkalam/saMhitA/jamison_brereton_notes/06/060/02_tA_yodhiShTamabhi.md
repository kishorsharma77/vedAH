Assuming that uṣásaḥ … ūḷhā́ḥ is a single NP, the question is what happened to the dawns. Ge, fld. by Re, thinks that the dawns were taken away, that is, abducted (entführten, enlevées). If, as Ge suggests (n. 2), this concerns the Vala myth, the dawns qua cows can be conceptualized as taken / stolen by the Paṇis.

(Oberlies [RdV I.180] goes further, seeing this as part of a myth about bridestealing, ultimately involving the Aśvins, though he admits [n. 150] that our vs. does not tell us who abducted the Dawn(s) or where she was taken.) HPS (B+I 180 n. 33, ) indignantly rejects the abduction interpr. and suggests rather that, on the basis of VI.64.3, 5, the dawns are drawn (ūḷhā́ḥ) by bulls. Although this is possible, and the cited passage is quite nearby, it doesn’t make a lot of sense for Indra and Agni to “do battle” for the dawns if the dawns are moving on their own steam, whereas if they were abducted, they need help.

In d Agni must be the immediate subj. of the clause, given the adjacency of the voc. and the 2nd sg. verb (agne yuvase) -- but, as Re points out, niyútvān is more an epithet of Indra than of Agni -- and, as he doesn’t point out, even more an epithet of Vāyu in conjunction with Indra. I therefore wonder if this has not been adapted from an Indra-Vāyu context, with a different set of dual divinities. The d pāda is also very close to an Indra passage fairly nearby: VI.47.14 apó gā́vajrin yuvase sám índūn, with Indra as the subj. of yuvase: “You join together the waters, the cows, and the drops, you possessor of the mace.” The substitution of Agni and the attribution to him of Indra’s qualities and actions is in conformity with the tendency noted in the publ. intro. of favoring the Indraic in this supposedly shared hymn.
