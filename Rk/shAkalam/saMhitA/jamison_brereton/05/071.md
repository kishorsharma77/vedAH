71 (425)
Mitra and Varuṇa
Bāhuvr̥kta Ātreya
3 verses: gāyatrī
This and the following hymn are attributed to the same poet, and indeed have  similar purposes and deploy similar techniques. Both hymns are straightforward invitations to Mitra and Varuṇa to come to the rite and to drink the soma. In V.71  the poet emphasizes his invocation to the two gods by repeating their names at the  beginning of pāda b of each verse. The repetition is underlined by the fact that  the names are followed in each case by just a single word completing the line, a  word that has a different grammatical form and syntactic function in each verse.
## 1
Come here to us with might, o you caring for the stranger, o Varuṇa  and Mitra,
to this cherished rite.
## 2
Because you are kings of all, being masters, o attentive ones, o Varuṇa  and Mitra,
make our insights swell.
## 3
Come here toward the pressing of the pious man, o Varuṇa and Mitra, to drink of this soma.
