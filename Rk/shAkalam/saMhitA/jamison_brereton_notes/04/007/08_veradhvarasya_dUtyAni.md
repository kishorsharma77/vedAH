The VP √vid āródhanaṃ diváḥ (a variant of our vidúṣṭaro divá āródhanāni) occurs in the next hymn, IV.8.2, 4, assuring that the acc. here is governed by the comparative to the pf. part. vidúṣṭara-. With most (though not Gr, WG) I take āródhana- as belonging with √ruh ‘climb’ (/√rudh ‘grow’), not √rudh ‘obstruct’. On the difficulties in sorting out these roots, see EWA s.v. RODH2 .
