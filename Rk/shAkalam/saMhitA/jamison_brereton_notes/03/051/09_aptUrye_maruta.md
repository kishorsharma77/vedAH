The abrupt temporal shifts continue in this vs., exacerbated by shifts in person. The poet first addresses the Maruts in the 2nd ps. and asserts something about Indra in the present time (or so I [and the other standard tr.] take the nominal sentence without overt copula). In pāda b the Maruts are then referred to in the 3rd ps.

-- though they are not named in this pāda, the other two occurrences of dā́ti-vararefer to them, and ánu √mad is a signature verb of theirs -- and in the past, in the
augmented impf. ámandan. (Though the Saṃhitā text transmits ‘mandan, the augment is metrically guaranteed.) This pāda seems an aside, reminding the audience of the Maruts’ previous involvement with Indra. The vs. then shifts to the present time again, with the Maruts remaining in the 3rd ps., as potential drinking companions for Indra.

In 6c Indra was urged to become “a friend of present help”; what that present help was/should be is spelled out here, a friend “at the water-crossing.” For watercrossing see comm. ad vs. 2 above. It is presumably not directly related to the Maruts’ applause in pāda b, for they provide material and moral support at the Vṛtrasmashing, not in crossing waters.

III.51.9-10. Note that pibatu takes an acc. in 9cd, but a gen. in 10c, as with ápibaḥ in 7b.
