Maruts
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: gāyatrī
A brief and simple pendant to Agastya’s Indra/Marut cycle. The Maruts as bring ers of rain are celebrated as sudā́nu “having good drops” (vss. 1–3), an epithet that  can also mean “having good gifts.” The poet asks that the negative aspects of the  thunderstorm stay far away from him and his people.
## 1
Bright be your course, bright with your help, o Maruts rich in drops, who gleam like snakes.
## 2
In the distance be your straight-aiming arrow, you Maruts rich in drops, in the distance the stone that you hurl.
## 3
Avoid the clans of Tr̥ṇaskanda (“Grasshopper”), you rich in drops. Set us upright, to live.
