A verse subject to numerous clashing interpretations. To deal with ádrau first

- Ge cites several passages in which Agni is born from or is the son of a/the stone. I
think it also likely that it is meant to contrast with duroṇé; the fire in the house is actual and visible, while the fire in the rock is merely latent and not easily acquired.

Most tr. take the two hemistichs as independent units, which then necessitates supplying something (what depends on the tr.) to make ab an actual clause. I prefer to take the whole verse as a single clause, with svādhī́ḥ as the predicate, whose complement is asmai (“… is very attentive to him [=Agni]”). This leaves the enigmatic expression viśā́ṃ ná víśvo amṛ́taḥ. Most tr. want this to refer to Agni; hence their interpretational separation of the two half-verses. I think rather that it refers to those who serve Agni, both gods and humans. The two groups are expressed in different ways and the connection between them is actualized by a pun on víś- ‘clan’ and víśva- ‘all’; this pun in turn makes the secret connection with Vaiśvānara, the clan fire (see Proferes p. 48). In the phrase, víśvaḥ can be read both with amṛ́taḥ (“every immortal”) and with the gen. pl. viśā́m “every (one) of the clans,” thus providing an indissoluble link between the mortal and divine realms. And the ná makes clear that gods are exactly like men in their devotion to Agni. I am reasonably convinced that this is the correct interpretation, but it does trouble me that it is apparently identical to Max Müller’s (as reported by Old, SBE n.), “To him also who dwells in the rock and in the house, every immortal like every one among men is well disposed.”
