On kukṣí- as ‘cheek’, not ‘belly’, see comm. ad III.36.8, VIII.92.24. Here the context is not diagnostic and might in fact slightly favor ‘belly’, esp. given vs. 1 of the next hymn (IX.81) by the same poet, which contains jaṭháram ‘belly’.

However, the preponderance of evidence for ‘cheek’ elsewhere is pretty strong.
