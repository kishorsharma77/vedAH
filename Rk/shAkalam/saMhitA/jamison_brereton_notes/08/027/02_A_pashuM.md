uṣā́sā náktam is a curious variant of the dual dvandva uṣā́sā-náktā, occurring only here. Old suggests that it is an ex. of a singular 2nd member following a dual in the 1st (cf. AiG II.1.154), which seems a description not an explanation. I think two factors entered into its creation: on the one hand, all forms of uṣā́sā-náktā precede a consonant; here that form would be in hiatus with vowel-initial óṣadhīḥ.

(Acdg. to Old, BR think that the original form was in fact náktā, but it was altered to avoid hiatus.) But all forms of uṣā́sā-náktā are also initial in trimeter verse, where a heavy fifth syllable is fine. This is dimeter verse, and a heavy fifth syllable would produce a bad cadence; light -am V̄allows an iambic cadence.

Here and elsewhere through the hymn I render viśvávedas- as ‘affording all possessions’, not ‘possessing all knowledge’, because it is usually found in the context of the gods’ generosity.
