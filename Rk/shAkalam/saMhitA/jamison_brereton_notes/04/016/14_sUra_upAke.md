As noted in the publ. intro., pāda b seems to resolve the problem of distinguishing between Indra and Kutsa that arose in 10cd. The same lexeme ví √cit ‘distinguish’ found in 10d recurs here.

The athematic middle participle uṣāṇá- ‘wearing’ here is a hapax stem and is, of course, morphologically anomalous: the full-grade medial root pres. váste is matched by a very well-attested full-grade athem. med. part. vásāna-. We do not expect a zero-grade formation to this root pres. However, our hapax calls to mind the unnamed hero of this portion of the hymn Uśanā (Kāvya), and the nonce creation of participle uṣāná- here (as an echo of uśánā) seems to me a text-book example of morphological aberrancies arising out of contextual pressures -- all the more striking because the word uśánā does not occur in this section of the hymn (but cf. 2c), so the participial echo is echoing something beneath the surface. WG’s characterization of this form as “eine individuelle Fehlbildung des Dichters” itself fails to see the poetic purpose and clever creativity of this form. It is true, however, that it should probably also be evaluated in the context of several other such anomalous participles in this group of Indra hymns, uśámāna- (IV.19.4), uṣámāna- (IV.22.2), and uśāná- (IV.23.1).
