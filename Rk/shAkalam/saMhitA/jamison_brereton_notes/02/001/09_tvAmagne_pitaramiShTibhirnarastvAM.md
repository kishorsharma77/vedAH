It is tempting to take iṣṭíbhiḥ as ‘with sacrifices’, parallel to śámyā ‘with ritual labor’ in the next pāda. So Old (SBE), though he gave it up reluctantly in the Noten.

Unfortunately ‘sacrifice’ is accented íṣti-, against iṣṭí- ‘desire’, and so perhaps the best one can do is suggest a secondary pun (so Scar 455). On the other hand, on the assumption that all -tí-stems began with suffixal accent and that the root accent found in some Vedic -ti-stems is secondary (see Lundquist 2015, -ti-stems), this may be a relic of suffix-accented *iṣṭí-‘sacrifice’, which has not yet undergone accent retraction. It is worth noting that root-accented íṣṭi- is found only in I and X.

On the cadence in 9 see remarks on 7b.
