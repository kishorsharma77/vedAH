Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins with Vasiṣṭha’s self-address, exhorting himself to praise Indra,  and it ends (vs. 6) with a verse summarizing the hymn, in which the plural Vasiṣṭhas  chant to Indra. The first two verses seem to establish the context as a verbal contest  between competing poets, although this context is not prominent in the rest of the  hymn. The dominating theme is simply the soma sacrifice (soma drinks, vs. 5) and  especially the accompanying verbal offerings (vss. 1–4). Praise of Indra’s great  deeds and powers is limited to a single pāda in the first verse (1c) and the second  half of verse 3. Even this latter provides a transition to the ritual: 3d seems to refer  to the Vr̥tra myth, and 4a might be taken as expressing the aftermath of the Vr̥tra slaying, namely the release of the waters. But we consider its primary reference to  be the waters used to swell the soma stalks before pressing; “swell” is regularly used  of fertile, milking cows, but here the paradox is that the waters swell as if with milk  although they are not themselves fertile.
Noteworthy is the second half of verse 2, a variant of the usual plea to the  gods to extend our lifetime for a hundred years. Here we ask that we be carried  across the various dangers to long life, though we do not know the lifetime we will  have. Otherwise, Indra receives the standard requests to distribute wealth to us  (vss. 4–6).
