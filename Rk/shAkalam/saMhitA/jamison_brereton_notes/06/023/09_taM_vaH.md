Once again a dependent clause seems to follow fronted portions of the main clause, in this case táṃ vaḥ sakhāyaḥ. (Although vaḥ sakhāyaḥ could belong semantically in the dependent clause, their lack of accent requires them to follow along with tám, or so it seems to me.) As in 5a the fronted material seems to establish the participants in the rest of hemistich: the god and the worshipers. The acc. tám is then doubled by both īm and the real referent índram in the main clause of b.

The foregoing assumes that the ellipsis of the verb in pāda a is not to be filled with a verb that could take tám as object or goal. I have in fact tried to find such a verb that an audience would supply when confronted with sám … sutéṣu, but I have not been able to come up with a plausible one. The most likely verb to supply is √as, esp. given 5d yáthā́sat, 9c ásati, and 10c ásad yáthā. Ge supplies “sich ergötze,” presumably a form of √mad or √mand, which would work contextually. But there is no positive evidence for this conjecture (unlike the three subjunctive forms of √as with yáthā just cited), and both roots are only marginally construed with sám.
