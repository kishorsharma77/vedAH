On abhí vyayasva see comm. ad VII.33.4. I assume ‘engird’ refers to the ends of the axle being embedded in the wheel hub.

The loc. spandané is generally taken as a third type of wood (besides khadiráand śiṃśápā-), but while the other two words are standard designations of trees, spandaná- is ordinarily not, but rather refers to a type of motion -- jerking or kicking.

I take it to refer here to the elasticity or flexibility of Dalbergia sissoo (śiṃsapā-), a quality it has (at least acdg. to the internet).
