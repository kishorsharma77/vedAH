The nonce verbal form vipanyā́mahe has attracted a remarkable amount of discussion; for a detailed and clear summary see Kulikov (-ya-presents, 143-46), though his passive/reciprocal interpr. I cannot follow. Insofar as there has been a standard analysis of it, it has been as a passive to √pan ‘admire’ (Wh Rts, reflected in Ge’s tr.), but other root associations and morphological analyses abound, which I will not discuss further. It belongs with a group of other, better-attested formations: fem. noun vipanyā́- and adj. vipanyú-, which I take as ‘admiration’ and ‘seeking/expressing admiration’ respectively. (This point was made forcefully by Thieme in Fs. Risch [1986: 165-66], though I do not follow his ultimately etymology.) (For a similar system, cf. vasūyá-(ti), vasūyā́-, vasūyú-.) I take vipanyā́mahe as a denominative -yá-verb associated with these nominal forms, derived from the root √pan (in my view); it is transitive in value and takes vām as object. With Thieme (an analysis fld. by subsequent interpr. Kulikov WG), I take the last part of pāda b, ví paṇír hitā́vān, as a separate nominal clause, but unlike these interpr. I take it as the main clause attached to the causal clause beginning in pāda a.

The phonological play of vipan(yā́mahe) ví paṇ(ír) clearly contributed to the word choice here, as Kulikov also notes. As for the sense of this hemistich, it simply rephrases the purport of vs. 6: because we singers are doing our job in the ritual economy by praising the gods, our patron is being generous to us and cannot be labeled a ‘niggard’.
