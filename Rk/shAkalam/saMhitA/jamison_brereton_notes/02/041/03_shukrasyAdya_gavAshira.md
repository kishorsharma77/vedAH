The stem niyútvant- (3b) is repeated from 1c and 2a, as noted above, but here as an apparent gen. sg. modifying the soma drink (or rather one of them), not a god or gods. Ge (n. 3b) suggests that it is a metrically conditioned “hypallage” for dual niyútvantā, which would qualify Indra and Vāyu. This is a clever idea and would restore parallelism to the phraseology of the tṛca, though I’m not sure that’s necessary: Rigvedic poets enjoy tweaking parallelism in the syntactic equivalent of a slant rhyme. Old floats a truly oddball idea, unworthy of his usual acuity: that niyútvant- should modify an unexpressed ráthena but in the absence of a head noun in the proper case it gets sucked [not Old’s term] into the gen. by the “benachbarte” gen. Even if this were a reasonable explanation in principle -- that an untethered adj.

could be captured by an adjacent or nearby word in another case -- niyútvataḥ is actually in a different pāda from the other genitives and is adjacent only to the dual dvandva índrāvāyū.
