Indra  
Śaṃyu Bārhaspatya  
33 verses: gāyatrī, except atinicrt 29, anu ̥ ṣṭubh 33, arranged in trcas ̥  
Like the preceding hymn, this one is composed of tr̥cas, the first ten to Indra, the  last one (vss. 31–33) a dānastuti to the patron Br̥bu. Given its position in the Indra  cycle, it is unlikely to have been originally a single hymn, but there are some themes  that keep recurring throughout the hymn, such as the comparison of Indra with a  cow or calf (vss. 7, 22, 25–26, 28), the sacred formulation as a vehicle for Indra (vss.  4, 7, 19), and the stake that is set as a prize in a contest (vss. 2, 11–13, 15). However,  rhetorical unity within tr̥cas seems almost entirely lacking.
