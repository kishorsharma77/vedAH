Indra
Suhotra Bhāradvāja
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except śakvarī 4
This hymn begins by proclaiming Indra’s power over all peoples and all the cosmic  and earthly realms (vss. 1–2), before focusing on several of his famous battles and  the mortals he aided in them (vss. 3–4). The final verse exhorts Indra to perform the  same martial services for us.
The most interesting verse is the first, where at first glance the logical connec tions among the three clauses are not clear. But the contrast between the singleness  and unification of the first half of the verse and the division in the second seems  to be the point. Indra is the single lord of wealth because he can gather all peoples  just in his two hands—peoples who were otherwise disunited and quarreling over  the various goods of existence. Indra’s act of unification in this verse seems to be  a kind of wishful thinking on the poet’s part, however, for the battles depicted in  verses 3 and 4 are the result of disunity, and in verse 5 we call on Indra for aid in the  same sorts of disputations found in 1cd. The “separate peoples” (carṣaṇí) of verse  1 also return in verse 5; the poet wishes to see them as a sort of universal audience  for the fame of himself and his people, brought about by Indra’s intervention on  their behalf.
