On aśāyatam see VI.33.2.

ātméva vā́taḥ is an underlying grammatical pun. Though vā́ta- is of course an Indo-Iranian word for ‘wind’, historically it is actually a thematized present participle to the ‘blow’ root. Here I think it is an adjective ‘blowing’ qualifying ā̛tmā́, which is itself being compared to wind in this simile. ātmán- here shows its older ‘(life-)breath’ sense, not the ‘self, soul’ that already begins to take over in the RV.
