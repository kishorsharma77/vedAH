WG take sasvár as ‘in sleep’, against the standard interpr. ‘in secret’, arguing that the latter does not make sense with bubudhānā́ḥ in d. But pāda d is not directly associated with pāda a, which, with b, compares the poet’s pursuit of Indra to the stealthy tracking behavior of a hunter. Moreover, the other three exx. of sasvár(tā) (in a tight knot in VII.58.5, 59.7, 60.10) clearly mean ‘in secret’, as opposed to ‘in the open’ (cf. the contrast in VII.58.5 with āvír ‘openly’). It is true that the standard etymology of sasvár takes it from √sas ‘sleep’ (see EWA s.v. SAS), but the semantic development to ‘in secret’ isn’t difficult to imagine -- esp. if Skt. √sas, which violates standard root structure constraints, was onomatopoetic for the shushing/hushing verbal gesture (English “shh,” etc.). From “keep quiet” to “keep secret” is a short step. Although √sas is clearly an inherited root, with cognates in Avestan and Anatolian, the onomatopoetic interpr. could be regularly (re-)actualized by association with the (near-universal?) living “shh” interjection.

The position of anyā́n in b should, by my rules, make it definite (“the others”).

Though both Ge and WG render it as indefinite, there is no reason why it can’t be definite: the poet consults with his priestly/poetic colleagues or with those “who know” (vidváṃs-) Their answer, referring to “we men,” suggests that it is a defined group, quite possibly the priests performing the morning ritual. The action that qualifies them for attaining Indra -- waking up (early) -- is surely not simply reflecting a general sentiment like “the early bird gets the worm,” but refers to Indra’s attendance at the morning pressing; cf., e.g., IV.35.7 prātáḥ sutám apibo haryaśva “Early in the morning you drank the pressed (soma), you of the fallow bays.”
