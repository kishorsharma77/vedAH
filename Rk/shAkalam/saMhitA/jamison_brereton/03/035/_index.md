Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
11 verses: triṣṭubh
A simple hymn, entirely devoted to Indra’s journey to the sacrifice and his enjoy ment of it, mostly expressed in the imperative. The progress of the hymn is com pletely chronological, from the yoking of his pair of horses, through the journey,  during which Indra is exhorted to pass by other sacrificers (vs. 5), and finally the  arrival at the ritual ground, properly prepared, and the drinking of the soma. The  mention of the Maruts in verses 7 and 9 suggests that the Midday Pressing, devoted  to Indra and the Maruts jointly at least in Viśvāmitra circles, is the sacrifice in ques tion (see also, for example, III.32). There is also a rather charming concern for the  welfare of Indra’s horses (vss. 3, 7).
In the context of R̥gvedic poetry what is striking are the absent elements. There  is neither praise of the god honored nor any mention of his attributes or heroic  deeds. (The sole exception is 9b, with its unelaborated allusion to the Maruts’ role  in strengthening Indra and the alliance resulting therefrom.) Nor do we hear about  the purpose of Indra’s soma-drinking—rousing him to perform heroic deeds either  in the past or for our benefit now. Nor, despite the many imperatives, does the poet  ask for any gifts or for aid of any sort. It is an extraordinarily focused hymn, and  its apparent simplicity may result not from artlessness, but from careful pruning.
