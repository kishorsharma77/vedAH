Ge supplies the verb ‘drive’ in c (“Mit diesen (treib) alle Angriffe auseinander”), but I see no reason why it can’t be in the orbit of d. In vs. 1 the two pādas cd share a single verb (avīḥ c), as do the first two pādas of this vs. (vyathayā).

With this pattern established, it seems reasonable to take áva tārīḥ in d as also governing the accusatives of c. Under this interpr., I take víṣūcīḥ as proleptic, rather like 3d kṛṇuhī́párācaḥ “put them far away.”
