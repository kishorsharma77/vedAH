I take the ‘comrades’ addressed by the voc. sakhāyaḥ to be different from those mentioned in the dative in the preceding vs. There the comrades of the god were the (other) gods who receive the oblation from Agni; here they are the 126 comrades of the poet, who urges them to tend to the god. The identity of comrades obviously depends on who they are comrades to.

Pāda d implicitly echoes 4d.
