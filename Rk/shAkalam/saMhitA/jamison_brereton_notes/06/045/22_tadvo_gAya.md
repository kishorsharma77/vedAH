The first pāda contains the common locution in which a poet addresses himself in the sg., but makes a nod to his ritual colleagues in the 2nd pl.: tád vo gāya.

Lit. this should be “Sing (o poet=me) this, (on behalf of) you all (=priests).” See my “Poetic Self-Reference in the Rig Veda and the Persona of Zarathustra” (Fs.

Skjaervø, BAI 19 [2005]), where this passage is disc. p. 69. The effort to introduce the 2nd pl. into the English would overbalance the tr., in a way that the slender enclitic vaḥ does not.

The simile in c is somewhat unsettling: “Sing what is weal for the able one as if for a cow.” Presumably it’s not the song that would be weal for a/the cow. Sāy.’s explan., reported by Ge (n. 22c), may well be correct: “as (fodder is) for a cow.” Recall also 7c gā́ṃ ná dóhase huve “I call upon (Indra) like a cow for milking,” where the cow simile is filled out. In light of this passage it may be that here what is weal for the cow is not fodder but rather the call to be milked, which would better resemble the song that is weal for Indra: “Sing what is weal for the able one, as (a milking call) is for a cow.”
