For the first three pādas, cf. III.55.21.

The construction of this verse is more complex than the two preceding ones and, in my opinion, displays some tricky relationships with Parāśara’s phraseology elsewhere. To begin with, the first simile as it stands is pleonastic at best: Agni should not be “like a god,” since he is a god. Nor should he be “like a god who dwells on earth,” since in fact Agni is the only god, or (counting Soma) the primary god, who dwells on earth. I suggest tentatively that the opening devó ná is there to match ná rā́jā at the end of the hemistich. Even more tentatively I suggest that what is really being compared is pṛthivī́ṃ viśvádhāyā(ḥ). Note first that in the preceding hymn (10cd) mother earth spread out “to suckle the bird [probably =Agni]” (dhā́yase véḥ) and elsewhere earth is called “all-nourishing” (II.17.5 pṛthivī́ṃ viśvádhāyasam).

I think here that Parāśara is covertly comparing Agni to the earth with regard to this well-known trait of hers, but does so playfully and allusively by stationing acc. pṛthivī́m next to nom. viśvádhāyā(ḥ) (in the same metrical position as II.17.5 though in Triṣṭubh not Jagatī cadence) and by the intertextual associations evoked by his stating that earth suckled Agni in I.72.9. So the, or an, underlying meaning of pāda a is “the god who, all-nourishing like the earth, …,” though both the position of the simile marker and the case of ‘earth’ disallow this as a surface meaning. (Let me make clear that I am not suggesting emending the text to *pṛthivī́.) The two compounds hitá(mitra-) (b) and puraḥ(sádaḥ) may make implicit reference to the word I suggested is to be associated with didhiṣā́yyaḥ in 2d, namely puró-hita, as a descriptor of the installed ritual fire. The second, puraḥsád-, is essentially a synonym of puróhita-.

Although I try to avoid explanations like “attraction,” I am afraid I must follow Ge in taking the common term of the similes in c and d as “attracted” to the comparandum: puráḥsadaḥ to the pl. vīrā́ḥ from putative sg. *puráḥsad, anavadyā́to the fem. nā́rī from putative masc. *anavadyáḥ. Although it would be possible to avoid the attraction analysis by reading both terms as part of the simile proper (“like heroes stationed in front and stationed for protection, like an irreproachable wife pleasing to her husband,” so WG), this puts the simile marker one element too far to the right and it also submerges the common term. This would be particularly unfortunate in the first simile, since there is a play on two slightly different senses of

-sád- there. (In I.65.5 a similar gender mismatch is found, explained by Re as
attraction, an explanation I rejected. But there it does not involve a misplaced simile marker.)
