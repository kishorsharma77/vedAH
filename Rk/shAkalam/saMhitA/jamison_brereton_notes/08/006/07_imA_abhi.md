The co-occurrence of a 1st pl. verb (abhí prá ṇonumaḥ) and nom. pl. imā́ḥ … dhītáyaḥ causes some interpretational difficulties. Ge takes initial imā́ḥ as an accusative plural object with the verb in pāda a (“Diese stimmen wir auf (dich) an”), separating it from dhītáyaḥ in b, and interprets pādas bc together as a nominal clause.

This would rescue the word order, but an accusative with √nu is almost always the goal of the roaring (and this exact phrase abhí prá nonumaḥ occurs a number of other times), not the contents of the roar, as an obj. imā́ḥ would require (but see comm. on I.6.6). I prefer to take the insights as identified with ourselves, both subjects of abhí prá √nu. Old also suggests this identification, which is also found in vs. 8.

With vipā́m ágreṣu compare IX.99.1 vipā́m ágre. There are 43 occurrences of sg. ágre and one of pl. ágreṣu; it seems unlikely that the number is significant here, but simply used to supply an extra syllable.

In c Ge sees two similes, “like the flame of fire, (like) missiles,” but I think the latter is not used as a comparison but an identification, just as in 3c the Kaṇvas praises are called their “familial weapon” (jāmí … ā́yudham).

The simile marker ná is again misplaced; we would expect *agnér ná śocíḥ.
