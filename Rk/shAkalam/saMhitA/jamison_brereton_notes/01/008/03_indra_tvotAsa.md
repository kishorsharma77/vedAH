Concatanation of tvótāsaḥ (pāda a) with the same form in 2c, though the one in 2c requires distraction (tuvo-), but not the one in 3a. Ge/Re take ghanā́as (an archaic) instr. sg., but nom. pl. ghanā́(ḥ) seems preferable, esp. as Madhuchandas uses the same word in the sg. as a personal designation in I.4.8 (where it applies to Indra and which I tr. ‘bane’). So Old. Although designating animate beings (namely “us”) as “hammers” may seem unusual, it’s not unprecedented, at least in English: cf. the rock song entitled “Sometimes you’re the hammer and sometimes you’re the nail,” and (gleaned from Google) a quotation from an American poet unknown to me, Edwin Markham (1852-1940), “For all your days be prepared, and meet them ever alike. When you are the anvil, bear - when you are the hammer, strike.”
