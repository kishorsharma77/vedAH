mahé táne “for great extension” is found also in VIII.26.2, 46.25, where it appears to refer to the extension of the family line. This is possible here, esp. if naḥ is construed with it, as in the publ. tr. Ge suggests that it refers to the extension of lifetime (“zu grosser Lebensdauer(?)”) and Re to the ritual continuum, but as Re points out in his n., it could also simply describe, physically, the extension of the stream of soma. If that interpr. is chosen, the tr. should de-couple naḥ from the phrase: “… rush forth for us for (your) great extension.” The referent of the simile ūrmíṃ ná bíbhrat is suggested by IX.96.7 ūrmíṃ ná síndhuḥ.
