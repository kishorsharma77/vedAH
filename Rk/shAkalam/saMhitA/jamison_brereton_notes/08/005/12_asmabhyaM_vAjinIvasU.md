The voc. vājinīvasū recurs here from 3a; in both verses it is immediately preceded by a heavy dat. pronoun, the near-rhyming yuvā́bhyām and asmábhyam. Its other two occurrences in this hymn (vss. 19, 30) are not so structured.

“Shelter that cannot be cheated (/deceived)” (see also VIII.85.5) is a striking and somewhat opaque expression, since ádābhya- usually modifies animate beings (generally gods) who aren’t gullible. I assume that the intention is shelter that can’t be breached by trickery, vel sim., but the context of neither passage gives us any help.
