Agni
Kaṇva Ghaura
20 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
Long but relatively straightforward, this hymn first celebrates the communal fire  belonging to a number of clans, as Proferes argues (2007: 31), uniting them in com mon action (vss. 1–3). The poet then cites a divine precedent for joint kindling of  the fire (vs. 4) and assigns Agni various social roles: priest, householder, and mes senger (vs. 5), an almost trifunctional structure. Verses 7–8 conflate mortals and  gods in their expansion of territory and defeat of opposing forces, and the next  series of verses also mingle legendary and current mortals in their relation to Agni.
The mood of the hymn changes with verse 13. There follow a number of peremp tory commands to Agni, for help and, especially, protection from and destruction  of enemies, interspersed with mentions of help that Agni offered to previous mor tal clients. The more militant verses are reminiscent of X.87, dedicated to Agni  Rakṣohan (“Demon-Smiter”), although the latter hymn is more inventive than  this one.
