This vs. has no finite verb; I take it as a preamble to 8, in order to capture the play between the two forms of hinvānáḥ (7c, 8b).

When vánaspáti- (lit. ‘lord of the forest’) does not mean simply ‘tree’, it generally refers to the sacrificial post in the animal sacrifice, particularly when found in the Āprī hymns. The word is not found elsewhere in IX, except in the Āprī hymn IX.5.10, where it seems to have that reference. But here it must refer to soma. Since essentially all the plants that have been suggested as the source of soma are fairly insignificant physically, the use of vánaspáti- to refer to it must have seemed slightly comic (like calling a dandelion Lord of the Forest), but also a way of capturing the towering importance of the apparently lowly plant. The word is used of soma once elsewhere, I.91.6 (a soma hymn), in the phrase priyástotro vánaspátiḥ, almost identical to nítyastotro vánaspátiḥ, esp. because nítya- ‘own’ and priyá- ‘dear, own’ are near synonyms in some usages. The point, I think, is that Soma has first claim to praise.

On sabar- as ‘juice’, see EWA s.v. sabardúh- and Narten (YH 212). I construe the gen. pl. dhīnā́m with the first member of the cmpd. sabar-dúgha-: “… juice of insights.” I supply pavítre with antár on the basis of 5b antáḥ pavítre (cf. VIII.101.9). Ge’s “unter Liedern” does not work because antár doesn’t take the gen., and though Re’s “Arbres des intuitions” sounds imposing, it doesn’t make much sense. Old’s first interpr. of this pāda is close to mine, with dhīnā́m dependent on sabar-, though he takes antár as an adverb.

However, he considers the obvious solution to be to take dhīnā́m with antár, since the gen. is possible with antár in the later language. Since “within/amid the thoughts” isn’t a particularly compelling addition to the passage, I prefer my own (and Old’s first) solution.

The common med. part. hinvāná- can be both transitive and passive, in approx. equal numbers. In this vs. it is transitive, but in the next passive.
