pári √mṛś is a more vivid expression than Gr’s ‘geistig berühren’, Ge’s ‘befassen’ indicate: in X.34.4 it is the verb the Gambler uses in his tortured imagining of others fondling his wife: anyé jāyā́m pári mṛśanti asya. Something similar seems to be the point here. The Aśvins put their powers at the disposal of other poets; Vatsa sees this promiscuity in almost sexual terms and begs them for an exclusive relationship.
