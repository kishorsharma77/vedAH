The position and function of ná in c are somewhat troubling. If, as seems likely, it is the simile marker, its position should mark marútvantam as the simile “like one accompanied by the Maruts,” but this makes no sense, since Indra’s being accompanied by the Maruts for real is the insistent point of this hymn. It therefore must be construed with the following infinitival vṛñjáse and have an “as if” sense (so Ge), rather than participating in a strict simile structure. I attribute the flipping of the word order to the fact that simile-marking ná seems to be blocked from pāda-final position. See comm. ad X.21.1 and X.111.7. This phenomenon was already noted by Ge; see his n. 4a to IV.27.4. The only counterexample I have found is VII.68.8 It might also be possible to take vṛñjáse as a truncation of *párivṛñjase and the ná as the negative, “for (him) not to avoid (us),” but there is no model for this nor any reason to assume truncation.
