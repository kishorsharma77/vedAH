Whatever the reason for the previous vs., syá vājy àruṣaḥ “this reddish race horse here” contrasts with the áruṣī(ḥ) ‘reddish (mares)’ in 6a. Although in the publ.

tr. I identified the referent as Agni (and I still think he is a possible secondary referent), I now accept the view of Sāy., Ge, and Re that it is the Beipferd of the Maruts (see the parallels adduced by Ge in n. 7a); otherwise the 2nd half of the vs. makes little sense. The mā́prohibitive in c contains what looks like a root aor. subjunctive karat.

Flg. Wackernagel (Fs. Jacobi), Hoffmann (Injunk. 55-56; see also 92) explains this potentially embarrassing form as the injunctive to a thematized root aor., which thematization began from the ambiguous 1st sg. ákaram. He (somewhat disingenuously) notes that outside of mā́clauses the kara- forms are otherwise only subjunctives, and he further suggests that his two exx. are found in idiomatic expressions that belong to the Volkssprache, which could explain the earlier thematization (cf. also Aufs. II.344 n. 2). (His other ex. of mā́… karat in VIII.2.20 I explain differently, as not belonging to the mā́clause at all. See comm. ad loc.) Hoffmann’s thematic aor. explan. has been apparently accepted by Lub, who classifies the two forms identified thus by Hoffmann under “A-AOR.inj.” I am generally dubious, because the root aor. of √kṛ is so well entrenched in the RV and the -a-forms are otherwise found in clear subjunctive usage. However, I am somewhat sympathetic to the “idiomatic” explanation, esp. combined with a metrical observation: the injunc. kaḥ expected here is found almost entirely at the end of Triṣṭubh pādas, but would not work here at the end of a Jagatī pāda. Nonce thematization, esp. perhaps in a low-register expression, would be a quick fix.

WG produce a curious hybrid of prohibitive and subjunctive: “Nicht soll und wird er … (euch) langsam machen” (my italics). I do not understand the explanation given in the n., or at least do not understand what sort of grammatical category is envisioned: “Uns scheint ein expekativer oder voluntativer Konjunktiv deutlich mitzuschwingen: >(Auf keinen Fall erwarten wir), dass er euch langsam mache< bzw.

>Dass er euch ja nicht langsame mache!< This clearly builds on Tichy’s analysis of
the function of the subjunctive as “expectation,” but I do not understand how the subjunctive would interact with the mā́.
