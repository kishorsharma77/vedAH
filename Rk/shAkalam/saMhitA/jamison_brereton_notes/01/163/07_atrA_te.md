There are multiple conflicting interpretations of the personnel and import of this verse; I will not add another.

Pāda d raises several questions: 1) is óṣadhīḥ to be construed with grásiṣṭḥaḥ (so, e.g., Ge, Doniger, and me) or with ajīgaḥ, 2) who is the referent of grásiṣṭhaḥ, and 3) what person is ajīgaḥ. I take the plants with the splv. (For acc. rection with - iṣṭha- forms, cf., e.g., VI.37.5 vṛtráṃ hániṣṭhaḥ.) Within the RVic domain of discourse, the greatest devourer of plants is likely fire/Agni, the answer, therefore, to 2). With that identification in place, I take ajīgaḥ as 3rd sg. For an opposite interpr. on all 3 counts, cf. Krick’s “… dann wahrlich hast du, der Gefrässigste, die Pflanzen erweckt (verschlungen?).” The subject is the horse=sun, addressed in the 2nd ps. She takes the verb as suggesting a 2ndary pun on √gṝ ‘swallow’, and considers the larger sense to be that the rising sun (in spring) awakes the plant world to new life, and is at the same time their “Fresser.” This builds a lot of superstructure into the vs. In my opinion, the pāda simply expresses the conceit that the kindling of the ritual fire causes the sun to rise; assuming, with Krick et al, that “you” is the horse=sun, it can be the object of ajīgaḥ, with Agni as the subj.
