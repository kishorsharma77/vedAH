I read ánu both with what precedes (svadhā́m) and what follows (śríyam) and do not, contra Ge, take the latter as obj. of váhante. Med. forms of váha- are several times used reflexively of the Maruts’ progress (V.58.1, V.60.7, V.61.11, X.77.6) without obj.

My tr. of vṛ́ṣa-psu- and áhruta-psu- (as well as vṛ́ṣa-psu- in 10a) are owing to Thieme. See reff. at comm. ad I.49.3.
