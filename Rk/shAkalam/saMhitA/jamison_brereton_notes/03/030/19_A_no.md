Gr analyses dhīmahi as passive, but this is rightly rejected by all standard tr.: the numerous other examples of this form are all transitive. What then should we supply as object? I take the line of least resistance, importing bhágam from the preceding pāda. I take the b pāda to mean that we hope to take the portion Indra brings us now and put it together with the superfluity of his previous gifts (and those to come) (deṣṇásya … prareké). Ge (sim. WG) does not construe these two nouns together, but takes deṣṇásya as a partitive genitive, supplying the obj. of dhīmahi (“Wir möchten von deiner Gabe etwas auf Vorrat zurücklegen”), while Re takes the verb as reflexive: “puissions nous nous placer …” The Pp. and all standard analyses take ūrvá as underlying nom. ūrváḥ; I, however, take it as loc. ūrvé. Though Ge and Re tr. the word as ‘sea’, it really refers to the container, in this case the sea-basin, and so logically what stretches out is not the container itself but the liquid in the container. (WG tr. Behälter, but keep it as nom.)
