Pāda b is repeated in IV.38.7, there of Dadhikrā the racehorse. (This repetition is not noted in Bl RR.) Re at IV.38.7 and Ge here (but not there) take śúśrūṣamānaḥ as meaning something like “putting oneself at the disposal (of someone else, here Kutsa).” I assume that they are thinking of the enlarged root √śruṣ ‘be obedient’, but the two meanings seem quite distinct to me - I can’t see Indra being obedient to any man - and formally our participle is a well-formed desiderative to √śru. In both places I take it as meaning “desiring to be heard/famed’; here Indra also helps out Kutsa, but at least part of his aim is to ensure his own fame.

In IV.38.7 there is no subsidiary beneficiary, and so the focus on the subject and his fame is ever clearer. Heenen is similarly puzzled by Ge (238 n. 263) but tr. “(toi qui) en personne as la volonté d’écouter au combat,” attributing an active sense to the middle participle.

The word dā́sam beginning c plays off both (á)dāśuṣo in 1c and sudā́sam in 3b.
