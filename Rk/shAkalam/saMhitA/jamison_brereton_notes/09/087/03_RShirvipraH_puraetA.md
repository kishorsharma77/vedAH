The first hemistich contains three resonant words in the realm of poet / wordsmith / seer: ṛ́ṣir vípraḥ … kā́vyena, with kaví- represented by the vṛddhi deriv.

This deriv. is similar, but not identical to the patronymic kāvyá- associated with the immed. preceding uśánā, and by its difference in accent and in case, it cleverly plays on the full name Uśanā Kāvya. (On the tricky morphology of the name, see my 2007 “Vedic Uśanā Kāvya and Avestan Kauui Usan: On the Morphology of the Names,” in Verba Docenti [Fs. Jasanoff].) As Ge suggests, the Anukramaṇī’s attribution of this hymn to the legendary Uśanas Kāvya is no doubt based on this vs. The Engl. tr. does not make clear that “of theirs” is fem. (āsām) and must anticipate the cows (gónām) in the next pāda.
