As disc. in the publ. intro., this is an omphalos vs., which provides the solution to the paradoxes set up in the earlier vss. of the hymn, albeit in veiled form -

- veiling that has kept its actual contents obscure (and may still do).

The first half is fairly clear, until almost the end: it refers to the birth of Soma, here called both a kaví and “the embryo of truth” (ṛtásya gárbhaḥ)(see further below). This embryo was deposited, presumably at its birth or even its conception, “beyond the twins” (yamā́paráḥ). Given the two previous vss., which contain duals that refer to the two world-halves, Heaven and Earth (so identified by Ge and Re, e.g.), the most sensible interpr. of “the twins” here is as a reference to the same pair -

- esp. since H+E were referred to by the fem. of the ‘twin’ word in 3a (yamyā̀)(in
addition to 3c mahī́apāré rájasī and 4a mātárā). But this interpr. is somewhat clouded by the fact that the next pāda (5c) contains both a dual phrase yū́nā … sántā and a dual verb ví jajñatuḥ. It is of course the default interpr. that all three of these duals (the two NPs and the verb) should refer to the same pair. What is somewhat baffling to me is that Ge (followed by Re) decides that this pair is the Aśvins (see esp. his n. 5bc). The Aśvins do not otherwise appear in this hymn, and indeed Re outlines firm grounds to reject this identification in his hesitant n.: “la participation des Aśvin au cycle du Soma étant faible et le contexte cd insuffisamment précis.” (Curiously, though Ge’s more overreaching mythological interventions often stem from Sāy., Sāy. in this case provides the far more sensible interpr. of the two as Soma and Sūrya.) I think the Aśvins can safely be dismissed as candidates for the dual reference (so also Lü 275). Let us then return to the more likely referent for yamā́in b: Heaven and Earth. Pāda b seems simply to be saying that Soma (or part of Soma) was deposited as an embryo beyond Heaven and Earth, giving him cosmic reach indeed.

The trickier pāda is c. The presence of a dual nom./acc. and a dual verb of course invites the former to be taken as subject of the latter, and the standard interpr.

understandably follow this path, with the sg. subj. of ab supplied as obj. of the verb -- e.g., Ge “Als Jünglinge haben sie ihn zuerst ausfindig gemacht.” This is obviously possible, and it need not involve identifying the two youths as the Aśvins; Heaven and Earth could be the pair in question. However, the dual NP raises several questions. For one thing, are Heaven and Earth really young? And even if so, what does this have to do with the action in question. Further: why sántā? The pres. part.

of √as in the nominative is usually concessive, but “although being young” doesn't make much sense here. I assume Ge’s “Als” is his only recognition of the participle; Re’s “jeunes encores” must be his (see also Lü’s “Als sie jung waren,” 275). But none of these renderings really accounts for why the participle is there, or for why H+E are identified as youths.

I have a less straightforward interpr. of this pāda -- inspired in great part by Ge’s interpr. of pāda d, which he takes (n. 5d) as depicting the two births of Soma, the heavenly and the earthly. I think these two forms of Soma are already present in pāda c, in the accusative phrase yū́nā … sántā, and the subj. of the dual verb ví jajñatuḥ is Heaven and Earth, not overtly present but referred to as the yamā́in b (as well as in vss. 3-4). Under this interpr. the participle sántā has a reason to be there: it is an existential in a predicated proposition after ví √jñā ‘recognize’ -- rendered in the publ. tr. by “that there were two youths.” And of course it makes sense that Heaven and Earth would be the first to notice this, because the two births were located in those two places. It also makes sense that the two forms of Soma would be identified as ‘youths’, since they were recently born.

Following Ge on pāda d, the first mentioned birth “deposited in secret” (gúhā hitám) is the heavenly one (picking up níhito yamā́paráḥ in b), while a bit paradoxically (because of the úd ‘up’), the one “held aloft” (údyatam) is the earthly one, referring to the ritual presentation of the soma.

Given this interpr. of the 2nd hemistich, it is quite possible that pādas a and b refer to these two different births: the poet born with skill and mind (a) would be the earthly Soma, equipped for his ritual role, while the one deposited beyond the twins (b) would obviously be the heavenly one.
