The 2nd hemistich of this vs. is intricately interwoven with constituents overlapping; see Old’s sensible treatment at loc. The initial loc. expression consists of suté cit … apsú, with tvā interspersed in modified 2nd position. This tvā is not to construed with the nearby verb madāma (pace Gr), because máda- without preverb is almost never construed with an acc.; here that verb goes with the instr. ándhasā. The tvā finally finds its governing verb form in the participle śrīṇántaḥ beginning pāda d; it is so distant from it, with parts of two different constituents in between, because it took Wackernagel’s position in the clause. The adj. úttaram at the very end of the vs. modifies it: the soma is “higher” or “better” at this point presumably because the mixing with milk, the last step depicted, improves it.
