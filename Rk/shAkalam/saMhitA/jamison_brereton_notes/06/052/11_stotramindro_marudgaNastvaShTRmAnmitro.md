This vs. is essentially parallel to vs. 10: various gods are to enjoy both verbal and material offerings, with the verb stem juṣá- ‘enjoy’ held constant. Vs. 10 has an impv. juṣántām, but our vs. an injunc. juṣanta. The latter may be a substitute for the impv. in a metrical situation that favors a light final syl.
