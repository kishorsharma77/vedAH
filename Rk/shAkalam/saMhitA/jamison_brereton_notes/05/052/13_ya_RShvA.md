On the phrase ṛṣvā́ṛṣṭívidyutaḥ see disc. ad vs. 6; for the number disharmony in yé … tám see disc. ad vs. 7; for the seemingly unnecessary copula sánti see disc. ad vs. 2 as well as immediately below.

This vs. serves as another boundary. The Maruts of the thunderstorm, dominating the middle of this hymn, are reconfigured as ritualists, appropriate guests and participants at our sacrifice. The ritual context now takes over for the rest of the hymn. This thematic transition may help explain the sánti. In pāda a the Maruts are still lofty ones with spears of lightning -- untamed forces of nature -- but in b they are asserted to be poets and ritual adepts (kaváyaḥ … vedhásaḥ). Perhaps the sánti marks the two forms in b as predicate nouns in an equational sentence (X IS Y), where X and Y belong to very different domains.

The address or, as seems likely, self-address to the seer (rṣe) returns us to the very beginning of the hymn, with Śyāvāśva’s clear self-address in 1ab.
