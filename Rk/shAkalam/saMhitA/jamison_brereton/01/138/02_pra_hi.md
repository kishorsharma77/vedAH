So, Pūṣan, with praises I put you forward, like a nimble (horse) on its  course, so that you will get the negligent ones on the move—like a  
camel you will carry (us) beyond the negligent ones.  
When I, a mortal, call upon you, a god, who are refreshment itself, for  fellowship—  
make our songs brilliant—make them brilliant when prizes (are at stake).
