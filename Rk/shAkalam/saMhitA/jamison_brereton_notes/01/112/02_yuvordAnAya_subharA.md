This verse is very dense and has been subject(ed) to a variety of interpretations, the details of which can’t be laid out here. The first hemistich depicts gifts or some other desirable things mounting the chariot of the Aśvins to be given.

The gifts are qualified as subhárāḥ ‘easy to carry (away?)’ and ‘inexhaustible’ (asaścatáḥ); the latter word generally qualifies ‘streams’, objects that are not ordinarily capable of mounting anything. This already odd image (of gifts [implicitly compared to streams] performing the mounting) is made odder by the simile in b, which compares the chariot to something eloquent (vacasám) for thinking (mántave).

It is of course not unusual for a verbal product (a hymn vel sim.) to be compared to a chariot, but the semantic distance traversed in this hemistich is quite far. This outré simile referring to the chariot may anticipate 4c below.

I wonder if the hapax thematic vacasá- (in acc. vacasám) is wrongly accented for *vacásam, which could be an internally derived possessive adj. to the neut. s-stem vácas- ‘speech’. Although this putative *vacás- ‘having speech, eloquent’ would likewise be a hapax, it would belong to a standard derivational type. BR (and Monier-Williams) take just this word as a derivative of √vañc ‘move waveringly’, which certainly would better fit a chariot. But the following the following mántave strongly favors a derivative of √vac, given the common conjunction of thought and speech.

The final phrase of c, kárman iṣṭáye echoes that of 1b yā́man iṣṭáye, and the two forms of iṣṭáye should therefore be interpreted in the same way. I take dhíyaḥ ‘insights’ as the object of the seeking and supply “(us)” as the subject of the infinitive.

Others tr., with different interpretations of iṣṭáye, have taken different routes.
