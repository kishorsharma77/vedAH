The first word of the hymn, jīmū́tasya, signals that we are out of the core RVic lexical domain: this word for ‘thunder-cloud’ is found only here in the RV, though it is fairly amply attested elsewhere in early Vedic, and it has no obvious synchronic or diachronic etymology.

The construction of the riddle seems a bit weak to me, since the solution, given in d, várman-, is anticipated by its derivative varmín- in b.
