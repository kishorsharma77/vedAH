Ghee
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 11
The Anukramaṇī provides a bewildering variety of choices for the divinity of this  hymn: Agni, or the Sun, or the waters, or the cows—or ghee (ghr̥ta), the clarified  melted butter regularly used as an oblation in sacrifice. The last is clearly correct.
Ghee is here given the same type of exalted, high-style rhetorical treatment as  the other crucial ritual substance, soma, with which it is also identified in this poem.  Phraseology appropriate to soma is applied to the streams of ghee throughout, and,  like soma, ghee becomes the focus of mystical speculations and also the subject of  vivid images. It is not surprising that this significant sacrificial substance should  receive such poetic glorification, especially given the importance of cows and cow  imagery in the R̥gveda.
What should really surprise us is that only this poet in this late and final hymn in  just one maṇḍala should have seen fit to make ghee his subject. Soma, after all, has a  whole maṇḍala of 114 hymns to itself. Grammatical accident may help account for  the difference: sóma is grammatically masculine and thus easily personified, while  ghr̥ta is grammatically neuter. However, the prominence of the cognate substance in  Old Iranian (Aves. haoma, Old Persian hauma) and the existence of a lengthy praise  hymn to deified Haoma in Younger Avestan (the Hōm Yašt, Yasna 9–10) testify to  a long tradition of celebration of soma, which is not shared by ghee.644 IV.58
