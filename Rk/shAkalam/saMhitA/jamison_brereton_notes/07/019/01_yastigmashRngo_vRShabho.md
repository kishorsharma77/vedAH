Rhetorically interesting to begin a hymn with a syntactically nonindependent verse. This verse consists only of relative clauses (pace Ge; see below), which find their main clause referent in the first word of the 2nd verse (and indeed subsequent verses), namely tvám. Although ‘you’ clearly is the referent, the first relative clause of vs. 1 has a 3rd ps. verb (cyāváyati), though the second one switches to the 2nd person (prayantā́si). It might be possible to attribute the 3rd ps. in ab to attraction to the simile, but such a switch would be very rare.

The simile marker ná in pāda a is wrongly placed, after the 2nd member of a three-word simile, not the first (tigmáśṛṅgo vṛṣabhó ná bhīmáḥ). Ordinarily, given such a structure, the first word would be interpreted as the common term and therefore not a part of the simile proper (“sharp-horned like a fearsome bull”), but Indra doesn’t have horns, which should certainly belong to the bull. The wrong position may result from the fact that X ná bhīmá-, where X = an animal, appears to be a formulaic structure, esp. mṛgá- ná bhīmá- (I.154.2, 190.3, II.33.11, etc.; also siṃhá- ná bhīmá- IV.16.14, IX.97.28 and others). This smaller fixed phrase would then be fitted into a simile containing another term.

Ge takes pāda d as a main clause, following the Pp., which analyses prayantā́si as containing unaccented asi. But this requires him to invent a verb for the relative clause of c (“raubst”) for which there is no support - and no need. Already Old suggested accenting ási contrary to the Pp.

Old (see also Tichy) also notes the nice example of case disharmony, where both gen. gáyasya and acc. védaḥ are objects of the agent noun prayantā́. As has often been noted, suffix-accented -tar-stems generally have genitive complements, as opposed to root-accented ones, which generally take accusatives. But enough exceptions exist to allow prayantā́to take both. That gáyasya is parallel to védaḥ and not to ádāśuṣaḥ is shown by passages like IX.23.3 … ádāśuṣo gáyam and VIII.81.7 ádāśūṣtarasya védaḥ. It is possible, but not necessary, that prayantā́si is a periphrastic future. 15 I have no explanation for the comparative súṣvitara- ‘better soma-presser’, beyond the occasional use of the comparative for emphasis or intensification, without comparandum.
