Plants  
Bhiṣaj Ātharvaṇa  
23 verses: anuṣṭubh  
Atharvan in character, this hymn is addressed to the healing plants, which are  praised for their lineage and their powers and implored to provide remedies for  particular sick men. The 1st-person speaker is presumably not merely the poet but also the healer, and he calls on the plants to lend their power to his verbal healing  spells (see esp. vs. 14).
