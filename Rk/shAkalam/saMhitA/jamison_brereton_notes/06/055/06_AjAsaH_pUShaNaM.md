This vs. presents several problems, both located in pāda b: the hapax niśṛmbhā́ḥ and the highly unusual position of the accented 3rd ps. pl. prn. té.

To tackle the first issue first, I am generally persuaded by Berger’s 1966 explan. of the Skt. śrambh forms as hypersanskritizations of MIA vissaddha, etc., in his view itself a cross of Skt. viśvasta- and śraddhā. See EWA s.v. ŚRAMBH and esp.

KEWA s.v. śrámbhate. My ‘trusty’ reflects this possible connection with śraddhā- ‘trust’.

The position of té is highly unusual; this pronominal stem overwhelmingly takes init. (or modified init.) position in its clause. When it does not, it is usually adjacent to the verb or has some other obvious reason for its placement. Here it seems dropped in randomly. I therefore propose to read *tejana-śríyam, with téjana- ‘sharp point’ found once elsewhere in the RV and also thereafter. The only alteration of the Saṃhitā text this requires is dropping the accent on té. Here téjana- would refer to the goad or awl that Pūṣan wields (see, e.g. VI.53.5-6, 9). In the publ. tr. I made use of Narten’s understanding of -śrī́- in such cmpds as meaning “vollkommendmachen”: see her KlSch. 352 n. 19 for the transmitted reading of this cmpd jana-śrī́- rendered as ‘die Menschen … vollkommenmachend’ -- though I took

*tejana- as instr.: ‘who brings (all) to readiness *with his sharp (goad)’. But I now
prefer a different value for -śrī́- ‘splendid with his sharp (goad)’ vel sim., more in keeping with my interpr. of other -śrī́- cmpds like ghṛta-śrī́- ‘splendid with ghee’.

On the multiple semantic possibilities of -śrī́- cmpds see Scar (544-54); on this cmpd in particular, Scar (551): my interpr. is basically his choice B (though of course with jana- rather than tejana- as 1st member).
