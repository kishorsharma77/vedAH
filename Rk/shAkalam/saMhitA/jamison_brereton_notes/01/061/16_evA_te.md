hāriyojanā is unaccented and therefore taken by most as a vocative addressed to Indra. I follow Old in emending to an accented form (hāriyojanā́), modifying bráhmāṇi. See in the next hymn bráhma hariyójanāya “formulation for the fallow-bay-yoking.” As Old points out, taking it as a vocative with Indra requires either shortening the last vowel or allowing a lengthened vocative ending (which is not usual), and possibly also shortening the first vowel.

This verse is extra-hymnic in some ways: its opening breaks the pattern set in the previous 15 vss.; it makes a meta-announcement about the contents of the hymn just recited; and it ends with the Nodhas refrain. But it also forms a ring with the first verse, with the repetition of bráhmāṇi, and with the first part of the hymn concerning the presentation of praise-hymns, with the reappearance of suvṛktí, which was a signature word there (2b, 3d, 4c).
