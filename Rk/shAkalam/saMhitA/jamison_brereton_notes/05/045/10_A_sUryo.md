The structure of this vs. matches that of the last one: the first half describes a cosmic event outside of human control; the second ascribes control to the ritualists.

What is striking is that the same event is treated in both halves: the rising of the sun.

In ab the Sun has agency; he yoked his own horses and mounted the sky. But in c it is the priest-poets (“the wise” dhī́rāḥ) who guide him, through the waters that stand still for this progress, “giving heed” (āśṛṇvantī́ḥ) presumably to the poets’ words. (I owe the germ of this interpr. to Dieter Gunkel [p.c.].)
