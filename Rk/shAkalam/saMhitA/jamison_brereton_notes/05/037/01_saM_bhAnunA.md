As was noted in the publ. intro., the first pāda of this first hymn attributed to Atri provides the clue to the solution of the mythical puzzle posed by the narrative in Atri’s V.40.5-9 in which Svarbhānu (svàrbhānu-) pierces the sun with darkness and Atri restores the sun to heaven. The name Svarbhānu means ‘having the radiance of the sun’, and here Agni aligns himself “with the radiance of the sun” (bhānúnā … sū́ryasya). As I demonstrated at length in my book The Ravenous Hyenas and the Wounded Sun, Svarbhānu is simply an epithet of Agni, who inflicted the wound on the sun for cause (cosmic incest). This pāda signals the underlying connection of Agni and Svarbhānu with a minimum of fuss.

The dawns are ‘non-neglectful’ (ámṛdhra-) because they never fail to appear every morning.
