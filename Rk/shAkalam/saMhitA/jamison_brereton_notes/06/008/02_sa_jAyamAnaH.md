Here Agni Vaiśvānara is “being born in highest distant heaven” (jā́yamanaḥ paramé vyòmani), presumably in the form of the sun, in contrast to VI.7.5 with the same participle but a different location: jā́yamānaḥ pitrór upásthe “being born in the lap of your parents,” usually a kenning for the ritual kindling sticks, so that VI.7.5 refers to the kindling of the ritual fire. In that vs. Agni found the sun (“beacon of the days”), which was therefore distinct from him, and in the next vs. (VI.7.6) the backs of heaven were measured out by the sun as an organ -- the eye -- of Agni Vaiśvānara (vaiśvānarásya vímitāni cákṣasā, sā́nūni diváḥ). Only in the last vs. of that hymn, VI.7.7, did Agni Vaiśvānara himself measure out the cosmos and take on his usual solar aspect. The two pādas VI.7.7a (ví yó rájāṃsy ámimīta sukrátuḥ) and our VI.8.2c (vy àntarikṣam amimīta sukrátuḥ) are almost identical, but the former represents the resolution of the disjunction between Agni Vaiśvānara and the sun, while no such disjunction is found in our hymn.
