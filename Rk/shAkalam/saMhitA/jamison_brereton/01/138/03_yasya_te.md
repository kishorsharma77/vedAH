Pūṣan, since in fellowship with you your admirers who have just this  purpose have benefitted by your aid—have benefitted with such a  
purpose (as ours)—  
in accordance with this we implore you for a newer team of wealth.  
O you who are not wrathful, who are widely proclaimed, be a  
contender—whenever a prize (is at stake), be a contender.
