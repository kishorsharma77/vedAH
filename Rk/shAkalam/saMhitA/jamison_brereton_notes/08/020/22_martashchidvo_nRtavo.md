The theme of cross-species kinship in vs. 21 continues here, with the mortal seeking brotherhood (bhrātṛtvám) with the Maruts.

The verse as a whole, balancing brotherhood (bhrātṛtvám) and friendship (āptivám), should be evaluated in conjunction with vs. 13 of the next hymn (VIII.21, by the same poet) abhrātrvy̥ ó anā́tvám, ánāpir indra janúṣā sanā́d asi / yudhéd āpitvám ichase, where Indra is said to lack either. See comm. thereon.
