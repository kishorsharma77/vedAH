I do not see sufficient evidence in this vs. for the legalistic interpr. having to do with inheritance rights advanced by Old and Ge (fld. by WG). Again, my interpr.

involving the two fireplaces is at least thinkable, though there are a number of loose ends (in everyone’s interpr). In the first pāda in my interpr. the fire that has been taken out of the Gārhapatya leaves nothing behind. The two other occurrence of āraik have womb as obj. + a dative (as if it were our pāda b): I.113.1 evā́rā́try uṣáse yónim āraik “so night has left behind the womb for dawn” and I.124.8, which even has a sister: svásā svásre jyā́yasyai yónim āraik “The (one) sister has left the natal place to her older sister.” In both the idea seems to be that one has vacated the space for the other -- not left as legacy, as the legalistic inheritance interpr. requires.

Problematic for my interpr. is the fact that rikthám should be the equivalent of the womb itself (the fireplace), not the detritus that the fire might leave in it. Moreover, the two hearths that had been daughter and granddaughter now become sisters -- but a certain fluidity in modeling kinship relations would not be surprising.

In b the site of the new fire, the Āhavanīya, is the womb of this new fire and “the repository of the winner” (the winner being the fire itself).

The second half-verse is fairly clear (for this hymn) in its description of the churning of the fire: the mothers are the fingers, the two good workers are the two kindling sticks. See the fire-churning passage with kindling sticks in nearby III.29.1.

The yádī opening the second half-verse is better taken as yád ī, with the enclitic pronoun. See 6a below.
