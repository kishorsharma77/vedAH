Ge interprets the first relative clause as only consisting of yé te “die du hast,” but all things being equal, I try to avoid interpretations that require embedded relative clauses (though see the pseudo-izafe in 3b above), and in this case a relative clause that extends to the end of b is perfectly possible. That 50.8 has the same structure is an additional support for this interpretation.

The corresponding verse in the twinned hymn, VIII.50.8d, contains yébhiḥ svàḥ parī́yase. I therefore think that parī́yase in our c also has domain over d, also containing svàḥ. Ge, by contrast, supplies kṛṇóṣi, to produce a periphrastic causative “mit denen du die ganze Welt die Sonne schauen (lässest).”
