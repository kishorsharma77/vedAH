O Indra, drink the soma being pressed by the stones, poured with a  bucket, like a buffalo drinking at a well-spring—like a thirsty buffalo. For your delightful exhilaration, for your most exceptional feeding,
let them [=your horses] guide you here, like the golden (mares) the Sun— like the Sun through all the days.
