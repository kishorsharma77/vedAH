The connection of the first two vss., dedicated to the Ṛbhus, and the subsequent Indra vss. is made clear here: Indra is called ṛbhukṣán- (cf. the pl. applied to the Ṛbhus in 1b, 2b) in pāda a and compared with vā́ja- in b. Vāja is of course the name of one of the Ṛbhus, and they are all addressed as vājāḥ in 1b. Both Ge and Re take the simile vā́jo ná as containing the PN (e.g., “comme un Vāja”), though Ge allows the common noun sense as an alternate (“wie der gute Vāja [die gute Beute]”), but I think the comparison is stronger if the ‘prize’ sense is more prominent and the relationship to the Ṛbhu name is backgrounded. However, I would now emend the tr.

to recognize the PN explicitly: “Like a prize [/like (the Ṛbhu) Vāja] …” Pāda b, with its description of Indra going home, is reminiscent of the envoi in the fallow-bay-yoking oblation at the end of the soma sacrifice (cf., e.g., I.82a, III.53.4-6) and is therefore appropriate to the Third Pressing context.
