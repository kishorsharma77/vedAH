I take nṛvát as an adverb, since this neut. is almost always so used. Ge and Re instead take it as a full adj. ‘consisting of men, accompanied by men’ modifying a gapped noun (Besitz, la richesse) and implicitly parallel to bhū́ri … paśváḥ “abundance of livestock.” I am not convinced, and curiously the passage Ge cites in his n. 10a as support for the interpr. contains a nṛvát that must be adverbial. Still, I do have to admit that a few such expressions do exist outside of the neut. sg.: I.92.7 nrváta ̥ ḥ … vā́jān, IX.93.5 rayím ... nrvántam ̥ .
