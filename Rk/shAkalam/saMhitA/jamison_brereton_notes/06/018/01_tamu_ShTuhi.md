This vs. contains two pairs of positive/negative etymological figures, both consisting of a pres. participle with “active” value (though one of them is morphologically middle) and a negated past part.: vanvánn ávātaḥ “vanquishing but unvanquished” and áṣāḷham … sáhamānam “conquering but unconquered.” It may not be an accident that the root syllables in each pair, though related by standard derivational processes, are quite distinct because of morphophonemic changes: van / vā and sah / ṣāḷh.
