ā́suvat ‘impelled’ is of course a pun on Savitar, its subject.

The final pāda is parallel to 2a: … prá yád ichánta aítana / … yác chravayánta aítana, each with a pres. part. combined with the main verb aítana.

What exactly is happening in 3d is unclear, since Agohya is a shadowy figure in Ṛbhu mythology. In Ṛbhu hymns they sleep in his house (I.161.11, IV.33.7); the most similar passage to ours is I.161.13, where the Rbhus ̥ after their sleep ask him ágohya ká idáṃ no abūbudhat “O Agohya, who has awakened us here/now?” In our passage the mirror-image action seems to be depicted -- they're making him heed, that is, waking him up. I do not know what to do with this observation, however.
