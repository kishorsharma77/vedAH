On the difficulties of interpr. of this verse, see publ. intro.

In f Ge and Re take aryamā́as subject of duhre and are then at pains to assemble enough other personnel to count, at least conceptually, as a plural with pl.

verb duhre. (Cf. Re “Aryaman (ainsi que) l'officiant (et autres) l'ont traite-à-fond.”) But not only does this not work grammatically but it does not make sense: since the gods gave the cow to the Aṅgirases (de), surely they are the ones who have milked her dry. Although major syntactic breaks in the middle of pādas are rare, in this case we must take sg. aryamā́as starting a new sentence (so also WG). Note that pāda a also seems to have a syntactic break after śṛṇuhi, though it is less jarring because the subject of the next clause remains the same.

As for the sense, I am quite baffled. The Aṅgirases seem to have mistreated the cow, or at least gotten everything they can out of her. But Aryaman also has knowledge, and perhaps use, of her. I suggest very tentatively that since Aryaman is associated with the householder’s fire and with hospitality rites, this may be an early and oblique reference to a division between what will later be known as śrauta rites and gṛhya rites. But I have no confidence in this.
