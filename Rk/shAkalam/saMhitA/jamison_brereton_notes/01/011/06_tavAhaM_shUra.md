Although Ge suggests simply that the poet is announcing Indra’s gifts to the river of his native land, this may have a further mythological reference. Esp. in X.108 (Saramā and the Paṇis), the (Vala) cave in which the Paṇis have trapped Indra’s cows is on the edge of the world, across the river (Rasā) that borders the world. Here the poet may be evoking this myth to indicate the efforts that he (and Indra) must expend to retrieve the good things his community desires, and to emphasize that poets and wise men (see also vs. 7) must bear witness to Indra’s deeds performed far away in order to attract his munificence.
