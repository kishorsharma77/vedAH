In the publ. tr. the injunc. uchán is rendered as a preterite; I’d now be inclined towards a pres. “the dawns dawn,” if the vs. depicts the ritual scene unfolding. If, however, it is an account of the Vala myth, a preterital uchán would be better. Since there is probably split temporal reference here, describing the actions both of the mythical Aṅgirases originally opening the Vala cave and of the priests reenacting this mythic model, the injunctive uchán can fit both scenarios—likewise the perfects that follow (vividuḥ b, ví vavruḥ c, sasruḥ d), since that tense can be used both for both distant and immediate past. Unfortunately English does not have a temporally un- (or under-)marked tense like the injunctive, and so a choice between present and preterital translations has to be made.

On the basis of the next hymn, VII.91.4 náraḥ … dī́dhyānāḥ (and see also our 5a), the subject of b should be ‘men’ or the Uśij-priests in the next pāda, though the ‘dawns’ of the previous pāda would technically be available.

I did not render cid in c in the publ. tr. Cf. V.29.12, where the same phrase opens the pāda and cid likewise appears to be functionless. It could perhaps mean ‘also’ here, as a second action after finding the light.
