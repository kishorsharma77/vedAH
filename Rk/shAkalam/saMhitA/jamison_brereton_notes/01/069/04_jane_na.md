I supply mitráḥ ‘ally’ on the basis of a number of similar formulaic phrases: jáne mitró ná X.22.1; mitráṃ ná jáne VIII.23.8 (of Agni); mitrá iva ... jáne II.4.1 (of Agni). This would be via the collocation mitrá śéva; cf. nearby I.58.6 mitráṃ ná śévam divyā́ya jánmane “favorable like an ally to the divine race,” also of Agni, with a different word for ‘people, race’ (cf. also śévam mitrā́ya X.113.5, a diff. permutation). Note also, two hymns previously, I.67.1b márteṣu mitráḥ, where márteṣu is a reasonable equivalent to jáne.

āhū́rya- is a hapax, universally taken to belong to √hvṛ ‘go crookedly, go astray’; although this derivation is not impossible, it leads to some forced tr. (e.g., Ge Durchgänger [‘bolter’, of horses]). I take it rather as the gerundive to the seṭ root √hṝ ‘be angry’.
