On asmád abhí see comm. ad V.33.3.

The standard tr. supply ‘word’ (vácaḥ Ge n. 8a) as the neut. sg. subject with yád … citrám … in de, but a singular form of paúṃsya- in ab is more easily supplied from context, and deeds can easily “resound” by semantic transference.

I interpr. the structure of d-g differently from the standard interpr., which take tád as the antecedent both of the yád clause in de (yád … ghóṣāt …) and the one in f, yác ca duṣṭáram, echoed by g. By this interpr. the two yád clauses are overtly conjoined (yád … yác ca) around the main clause referent (tád), with the 2nd embedded in the main cl. before the verb didhṛtā́in the echo pāda. Klein explicitly accounts for this disruption of structure by asserting that the yác ca clause “has been postposed in pāda c because its required repetition in d provides a coherent punaḥpadam” [he must mean f and g respectively]. This seems like a bit of a cop out to me - it wouldn’t be “required” to be repeated if it hadn’t ended up in that position in the first place, for other reasons. Contrary to this analysis, I take f(g) as containing an “X and which Y” (tád … yác ca) construction of the familiar type, with two different referents. The X is also further specified by the preposed rel. cl. in de (yád vaḥ … ámartyam), but the yád clause in de and the one in f (echoed by g) are entirely unconnected and have different referents. The placement of the yác ca clause and the ca seem to me strong evidence for my interpretation.

As for the referent of yác ca duṣṭáram (fg), I supply dyumnám also from context (b dyumnā́ni); cf. also III.37.10 dyumnáṃ dadhiṣva duṣṭáram.
