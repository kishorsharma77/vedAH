The poet’s playfulness continues. The qualifier niyútvan-, ‘possessing a team’, common in these Vāyu contexts (see in this hymn sequence III.46.2, 47.1, 47.3) opens pāda b; the preceding pāda opens with a near phonological match, niryuvāṇáḥ -- a participle to the same verb with a preverb that is only minimally different from ní. (The lexeme nír √yu is found only here.) It should mean ‘disjoin, disband’. My ‘take out of harness’ is an attempt to convey the play on niyútvan-: Vāyu ‘unteams’ the áśāstīḥ, while himself coming with his team.
