The aggrandizing of Soma’s role continues here, with 3 superlatives: varivodhā́tama- ‘best establisher of the wide realm’, máṃhistha- ‘most munificent’, and vṛtrahántama- ‘best smasher of obstacles’ -- the last of course borrowing Indra’s signature epithet, while máṃhiṣṭha- also regularly characterizes Indra. Re suggests that the three represent the three (Dumézilian) functions, but this does not seem particularly compelling.

Vs. 1 also began with two superlatives, svā́diṣṭha- ‘sweetest’ and mádiṣṭha- ‘most exhilarating’, but these are restricted to soma’s ritual role, whereas the three in this vs. attribute universal powers to him.

Pāda c is identical to VIII.103.7d, found in the very last hymn of Maṇḍala VIII, just as this is found in the first hymn of Maṇḍala IX -- so they are adjacent in the Saṃhitā arrangement. But I don’t know what, if anything, to make of this. If this is more than just accident, it would suggest that the compilers selected this particular Gāyatrī hymn to begin IX on the basis of this verbal correspondence.
