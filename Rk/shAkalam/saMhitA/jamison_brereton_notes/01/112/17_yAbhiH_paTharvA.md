Note the phonological play in páṭharvā jáṭharasya. Because of its accent, Ge (/WG) take jáṭhara- as an adjectival deriv. of jaṭhára- ‘belly’, hence ‘paunchy’ (supposedly of his wagon). But I think it likely that its accent simply follows its phonological twin páṭharvā, which immediately precedes (see also Old). The only possible indication of the independent existence of jáṭhara- is jáṭhala- in I.182.6.
