This vs. presents a number of puzzles, esp. in pāda b.

The verb in pāda a, raṃhate, should be intransitive. I construe the acc. jūtím loosely, as indicating the pace or speed at which Soma moves, which is compared to that of Viṣṇu, who is regularly modified by urugāyá-, though the adj. is not exclusive to him.

The phrase vṛ́thā krīḷánt- is also found in IX.21.3. It’s also worth noting that vṛ́thā is also found with several instances of pā́jas- ‘face, dimension’ disc. below (IX.76.1=88.5, 109.21).

The problems in pāda b center on the root affiliation of the verb mimate and the function of ná. The phrase in question is mimate ná gā́vaḥ. The pāda is incisively and persuasively discussed by Old, with whose analysis my own is in general agreement. To begin with ná, both Ge and Re take it as neg., but as Old points out, its position is against that. I think that it is the simile marker, but, unusually, marking the verb that precedes it as to be read in two senses, rather than marking a nominal phrase as the simile, as is its overwhelming use.

This brings us to the verb. Given the presence of cows, our first impulse is to think ‘bellow’; cf., e.g., IX.33.4 gā́vo mimanti dhenávaḥ. But, though √mā ‘bellow’ does have the requisite redupl. pres. stem mímā-/ mím-, it is only active, as Old also points out. I therefore think that ná here signals that mimate is an imperfect pun: it gestures towards ‘bellow’, but cannot belong to ‘bellow’ because of the middle voice. (Old also thinks the pun is present.) This accounts for my “as they seem to bellow” in the publ. tr. The root to which the verb actually belongs is √mā ‘measure’, which also has a redupl. pres., which, however, is generally middle. The voice of the verb in our passage thus favors √mā ‘measure’, though √mā ‘bellow’, at least initially, seems to fit the context better. What can ‘measure’ contribute? This question was ingeniously answered by Old: the cows, i.e., the milk mixture, “teilen ihm das Mass zu.” They “give him their measure,” that is, provide him further physical substance as he travels through the stages of his ritual preparation.

This image is continued in c, by the VP parīṇasáṃ kṛṇute. Although the acc. is generally taken as a substantivized neut. to a them. adj. parīṇasá- derived from the noun párīṇas- ‘fullness, profusion’ (so Gr; see AiG II.2.137), I consider it still an adj., with which we should supply pā́jas- ‘face, dimension’. This has good support in IX; cf. IX.76.1 = IX.88.5 vṛ́thā pā́jāṃsi kr̥ṇute “he deploys his full dimensions at will” and with a different medial verb IX.68.3 pā́ja ā́dade “he assumed his full dimension” (see also IX.109.21). The added milk allows him to expand and attain ample size or measure. On the association of cows/milk with parīṇas(a)- see VIII.45.24 gó-parīṇasa-, characterizing soma drinks. In the comm. ad VIII.45.24 I suggest that the 2nd cmpd member is parīṇasá- as here (hence a 2nd occurrence of that stem), not párīṇas- (per Gr, etc.).

Acdg. to Ge (n. 9cd), Re, Lü (267), pāda d depicts Soma as sun and moon.

This may well be, but I wonder if the source of the contrastive image is not the Overnight (atirātrá) soma ritual.
