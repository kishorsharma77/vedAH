Ge takes ājíṃ √yā as a phrasal verb (“mache ich … einen Wettlauf”) that can take an accusative (“einen Wettlauf um…”). I do not see any other way to construe bráhma, though I am a bit dubious about the construction.

The opening of c, tvā́m íd evá tám is an inflated version, with tonic 2nd ps.

pronoun, of tám tvā, which is found several times in this group of hymns (our 2c; also 51.6c, 52.4c). This inflation seems to have driven the preverb sám into postverbal position (áme sám).

Old and Ge accept the Kashmir reading *matīnā́m, but Narten (1960: 132 n.

34 = KlSch 22 n. 34) makes a convincing case that the transmitted mathīnā́m is correct and means ‘robbings/plunderings’. This works well with vājayúḥ, aśvayúḥ, and gavyúḥ in this verse, as well as bháreṣu in 7b.
