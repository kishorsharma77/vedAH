Gr derives sáṃvasu- from √vas ‘dwell’, and Ge’s “Hausgenosse” reflects this derivation (see also AiG II.1.75). But Old argues that it contains vásu- ‘good(s)’ and compares sahávasu-, vásubhiḥ sáha, an analysis accepted by Debrunner (AiG II.1 Nachtr. 24, AiG II.2.471), Re, and me.

With the standard tr., I take víśvam bhū́meva as a two-member simile, acc. + nom. A passage two hymns away in the same cycle, VIII.41.5 sá kavíḥ kā́vyā purú, rūpáṃ dyaúr iva puṣyati “he is a poet who fosters the many poetic arts, as heaven does its (concrete) form,” makes this analysis pretty much inescapable. But I am still somewhat concerned by the position of the iva (in both passages), following the 2nd element of the simile rather than the first, and víśvam bhū́ma ‘the whole earth’ would also be a possible NP.
