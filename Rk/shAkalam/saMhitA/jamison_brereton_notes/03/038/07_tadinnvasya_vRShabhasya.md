This vs. summarizes both creations. The first is dealt with glancingly in the first pāda. I take the neut. prn. tád ‘this’ as a reference to the not-yet-differentiated proto-creation, which belonged to and arose from the androgynous bovine of 5a, here explicitly identified first as masculine (asya: since this pronoun is unaccented, it does not modify what follows but functions as an autonomous pronoun), then as both bull (vṛṣabhásya, as in 5a) and milk-cow (dhenóḥ). This is the first appearance of any explicit feminine principle in this hymn.

The rest of the vs. concerns the second creation, with the original unitary tád divided and fitted out with names and forms. Note the return of the creation verb √mā ‘measure’, with ā́… mamire (b) and ní … mamire (d) echoing sám … mamire in 3c. The curious phrase sákmyaṃ góḥ has caused some puzzlement among interpr.

Although by formation the hapax sákmya- appears to be a neut. abstract derived from √sac ‘accompany’, the standard tr. (Ge, Re, WG) take the phrase as the equivalent of an animate creature, remarking that the companion of the cow must be the bull. But this not only ignores the abstract nature of sákmya- but also assumes that góḥ here refers narrowly to a female bovine, though the stem is regularly used as a cover term for bovines of both sexes. I take the phrase as meaning “the fellowship of the cow” (or better, though more awkwardly, “the fellowship of the bovine”) as a poetic description of what was depicted in pāda a, the joint activity of the bull-and-cow and its product. This undifferentiated creation is then measured out into individual parts and equipped with names. The subject of ā́… mamire in b is not identified, but I assume it is the same māyínaḥ as the subject of ní … mamire in d, whom I take to be the age-old poets we met in vss. 2-3.

Just as pāda b refers to the individual names, so does d refer to forms: the classical pairing of name-and-form (nāmarūpa) is thus distributed across the vs., as Ge already pointed out (n. 7b). I take asmin here as referring to the creation (it), rather than to a putative ‘him’ (as most tr. do). In the course of their creative activity the poets assume various powers (pāda c) to enable their individualizing work.
