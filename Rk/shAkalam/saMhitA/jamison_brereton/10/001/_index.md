Agni  
Trita Āptya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
An appropriate beginning to an Agni cycle, this hymn recounts the birth of the  ritual fire at dawn—the word jātá “at birth, once born” is repeated four times in the  hymn (vss. 1–3, 6). But this nascent fire is endowed with cosmic importance, identi fied as the embryo of the two worlds (vs. 2) and compared to Viṣṇu in his lofty reach  (vs. 3ab). The role of his hymnists is also given its due (3cd), and Agni’s pivotal  priestly role in the sacrifice is emphasized as the hymn continues (vss. 5cd–7). In the  final verse (7) Agni is sent forth to bring the gods to the ritual ground, where the  sacrifice can begin.
