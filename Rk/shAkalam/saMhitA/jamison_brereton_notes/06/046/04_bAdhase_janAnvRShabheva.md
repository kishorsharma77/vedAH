vṛṣabhéva is somewhat problematic: the Pp. analyzes it as vṛṣabhā́iva, which is phonologically impeccable, but what form would vṛṣabhā́represent? Old’s solution (flg. Lanman, Noun Inflection 329) that it is an underlying nom. sg. is surely the most likely, whether we subscribe to Lanman’s “crasis after elision [of the s],” i.e., vṛṣabhás iva à vṛṣabha iva à -e-. The publ. tr., as well as Ge., implicitly follows this route. A long-shot possibility is that the Pp. vṛṣabhā́is the underlying form, and it’s an old instr. sg. modifying or doubling manyúnā: “with bullish battlefury” or “with battle-fury as a bull.” But vṛ́ṣan- is the ‘bull’ stem generally used (quasi-)adjectivally, not vṛṣabhá-. It might also be possible to see it as a voc. vṛṣabha: this would easily account for the sandhi, but we would have to assume it got secondarily accented after it was no longer understood as a voc., and this would also introduce the interpretational problem of a voc. in a simile (though unfortunately there are a few such).

On the problematic ṛcīṣama see the despairing comm. ad I.61.1.

The three loc. in d specify the ‘stakes’ (dhaná-) referred to by mahādhané.
