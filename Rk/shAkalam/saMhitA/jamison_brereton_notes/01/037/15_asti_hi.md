This final verse is oddly disjointed. For one thing there must be a change of person from 2nd (vaḥ) to 3rd (eṣām) in ab in reference to the Maruts; it is difficult not to take these pl. pronouns as coreferential. I supply dúvaḥ in a, because this pāda is structurally similar to 14b; however, this is not strictly necessary, and an interpretation like Ge’s “Denn es gibt etwas für euch zum Schwelgen” is certainly possible. As for pāda b, it is generally taken to mean “we are theirs,” and, again, this is possible. But given its structural similarity to the immediately preceding pāda, I interpret it in similar fashion, as suggesting that we have something to offer them.

The last pāda then expresses what our service to the Maruts should bring about for us.
