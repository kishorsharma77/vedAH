I do not pretend to understand the myth or myths here; for an attempt see Krick 307 and nn. 794-95. I would point out, however, that stylistically this vs. is reminiscent of the famous vs. in the wedding hymn about the previous bridegrooms of the bride in question. In both, four separate beings act, each segregated in a single pāda, and it has some of the same vocabulary (note prathamáḥ, gandharváḥ, and tritáḥ/tṛtī́yaḥ both ‘third’): X.85.40 sómaḥ prathamó vivide, gandharvó vivida úttaraḥ / tṛtī́yo agníṣ te pátis, turī́yas te manuṣyajā́ḥ “Soma acquired (you) first; the Gandharva acquired (you) next. / Agni was your third husband. The fourth was human-born.” I do not know what, if anything, to do with these similarities.

Krick supplies a chariot for the horse to be yoked to in pāda a and for Indra to mount in b, but see 9d, where Indra clearly mounts the horse.
