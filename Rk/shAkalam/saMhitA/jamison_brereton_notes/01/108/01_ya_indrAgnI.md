The image of the chariot looking upon the creatures is a slightly odd one.

Elsewhere (VII.61.1, X.85.18) almost identical pādas are used of the sun, and it may be that Indra and Agni’s chariot here is identified with the sun, though such an identification would be unusual for these gods. Bl (RR) thinks rather that the poet “has borrowed and applied with a rather frenzied metaphor” the image of VII.61.1. It is worth quoting his characteristically acerbic comment on the image: “The students of the Rig-Veda are steeped in the experience of its bold, often grotesque figures of speech, so that even a chariot that looks down from heaven excites no unusual emotion.”
