The sequence mahínāsu is perfectly ambiguous. It can be a fem. loc. pl. of the poorly attested them. stem mahína-, as I take it in the publ. tr. and as Old is inclined to do. Or, with Pp., Ge, and Re, it can be disjoined into mahínā āsu, nom. sg.

fem. to the same rare them. stem and loc. pl. fem. to the near-deictic pronoun, unaccented because the referent is in the discourse. (Gr actually lists both mahínā and mahínāsu for this passage.) The difference in meaning is minimal: my “… who by her greatness shines … among the great (rivers)” versus “the great one who by her greatness shines … among the (rivers).” I now find that I am more disposed to go with the Pp. analysis, for reasons of wordplay, not meaning. The instr. mahimnā́in this passage is one of only three exx. of this form in the RV, with the restored -mncluster to the stem mahimán- -- against well-attested instr. mahinā́with the (old) cluster reduction of -mn- to -n-. If we accept the Pp. interpr., the adjacent words mahimnā́mahínā would implicitly play on both forms of the instr., with the nom. sg.

mahínā differing from the standard instr. mahinā́only by accent. If we instead take mahínāsu as a loc., that play is lost or at least considerably diluted.

The construction of b, esp. of anyā́ḥ, rests on that of 9ab.
