The lexeme abhí √tan has the idiomatic meaning ‘stretch over’ and therefore ‘extend control, dominate’. The image found in the simile (vrajám ná) is found exactly in the parallel IX.108.6, where the vrajám is not in a simile. Elsewhere (I.160.5, V.54.15) in the active it seems to mean 'stretch over' (and therefore dominate), and in a TS passage adduced by HO (III.4.6.2) Keith transl 'overpower', which seems right in context.

Here the question is the referent of the object in the frame, sū́ra upākácakṣasam “whose eye is near to the sun.” Ge supplies “Schatz” and thinks it refers to gold, which is “near to the sun” in its color and also (hyperbolically) its value. This is quite possible, but Agni is also found in just these expressions, e.g., IV.11.1 upāká ā́rocate sū́ryasya, and of course Agni is often identified as the sun.

The “gold” interpretation is probably correct, however, since the idea would be that Indra controls goods and therefore can distribute them to us; what Indra’s control over Agni would amount to is less clear. Note the independent gen. sūráḥ dependent on the first member of the compound upāká-.

Because the verb of c is a subjunctive, which would clash with the preterital perfect of ab, I take c with the following verse, whose present tense verbs are more compatible with a subjunctive.
