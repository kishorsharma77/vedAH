The just discussed phrase in 14d yé yajñíyāsaḥ is picked up by 15a yé devā́nāṃ yajñíyā yajñíyānām. I assume that this phrase doesn’t introduce another group of worthies, but is simply an intensive elaboration of the original phrase. The next pāda qualifies them with another derivative of √yaj, the -tra-stem yájatra-, which I interpr., somewhat capaciously, as meaning that they provide the occasion or reason for Manu’s sacrifice.
