Whoever will yoke with a hymn these two fallow bays of yours, o  champion Indra, the two dear ones, good at the chariot, seeking  
fodder,  
I (as that person) would turn hither the very resolute god of custom  [/Aryaman, here = Indra] who confounds the battle fury of the one  
who wishes to do harm.
