As just noted, this vs. contains an apparent attempt to express anteriority: the pluperfect ā́viveśīḥ seems to function like an English pluperfect (rather than the standard Vedic plupf., a past tense to a presential perfect), to express an action that happened before the action of the main verb, an interpr. more or less endorsed by Kü (500).
