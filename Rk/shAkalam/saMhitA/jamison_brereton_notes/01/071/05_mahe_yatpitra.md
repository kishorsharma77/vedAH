This vivid account of the incestuous attack of Father Heaven on his own daughter (elsewhere Dawn) comes as a surprise in this hymn. The connection must be the fact that this incest led to the birth of the Aṅgirases, who were the subject of vs. 2 (and possibly vs. 3); this birth is mentioned in the other incest verse, vs. 8cd, though without naming the Aṅgirases. The other connection is that Agni, unnamed, is the avenger in this verse, shooting Heaven as he released his semen into his daughter. Although the avenger is usually identified as Rudra on the basis of postṚvic passages (see Ge n. to vs. 5, Re, WG), I have demonstrated (Hyenas, 288-97) that the original avenger was Agni. Note that ástā ‘archer’ is used of Agni in the last verse of the immediately preceding hymn (I.71.11). I also take Agni as the subj. of pāda b: like a hunter on his prey, he creeps up on the pair, having noticed the caresses (pṛśanyàḥ) Heaven was bestowing on his daughter.

In addition I consider Agni to be the subject of pāda a (with most tr.), but the action there is harder to explain: how and why does Agni make the sap=semen for Heaven if he disapproves of Heaven’s sexual designs on his daughter and in fact punishes him for the rape? For one thing, fire is unlikely to produce anything we might consider sap; in a naturalistic sense, making rása for heaven would seem to be storing up rain. However, our notions of nature and Vedic India’s are often at odds.

That the same semen (or possibly its delivery agent, the penis) is called tvíṣi- ‘spark, flare’ in pāda d and, even more telling, is referred to as “blazing semen” (śúci rétaḥ) in 8b, brings it into fire’s conceptual sphere. It may be that the flaring up of fire produces Heaven’s semen. But what is Agni’s motivation? I’m afraid this remains mysterious; perhaps it was involuntary, produced by the flaring up just suggested.
