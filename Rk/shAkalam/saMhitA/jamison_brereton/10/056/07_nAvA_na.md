As if with a boat across the swell through all the earth’s directions,  (having gone) beyond the difficult places with blessings,  
Br̥haduktha by his greatness has placed his own offspring both among  later ones and among those previous.  
After the sequence of hymn trios beginning with X.39, the next group (57–60), of  four hymns, seems out of place, but Oldenberg (1888: 236) suggests that the whole  has been arbitrarily divided into four hymns and could conceivably be resolved into  three. The hymns share a theme—that of healing and returning to life—and are  ascribed to “the four Gaupāyanas.” Perhaps the division into four hymns was sug  
gested by the four supposed authors.
