The unidentified creature in vs. 4, finally identified as a bull or as bullish (vṛ́ṣan- 4c), returns in this vs., with a slightly different ‘bull’ designation (vṛṣabhá-).

Here it is depicted as androgynous: though masc. in gender and called a bull, it gives birth (ásūta). Androgyny is a powerful signal of the lack of differentiation I have been discussing, since perhaps the fundamental, universal binary contrast is male : female.

The bull’s act of birth results in the desired differentiation that characterizes creation. This is expressed both by ‘many’ (pūrvī́ḥ) in b and, indirectly, by the address to the two sons of heaven (dívo napātā) in cd. These two then seem to establish control over what has been created in the earliest time (pradívaḥ ‘from olden days’) and therefore implicitly preside over time.

I would now be inclined to interpr. pāda b as an expression of possession, “His are these many proliferating riches.” Cf. VI.3.3, also IV.23.8. However, the context is not definitive.

I interpr. and construe vidáthasya in c differently from most, who take it with dhībhíḥ, with the interpr. further complicated by variant renderings of vidátha- (Ge “im Geiste der Weisheit”; Re [EVP] “grâce aux visions-poétiques de la cérémonie”; WG “mit den Einsichten der (Beute-)Verteilung”). None of these makes a lot of sense to me, and therefore, despite the adjacency of vidáthasya and dhībhíḥ, I construe the former instead with kṣatrám “dominion of/over the (cosmic) division.” On this sense of vidátha- see comm. ad VIII.39.1: though the word generally refers to the ceremonial distribution of wealth and then to the ceremony where this happens, it can also refer to other types of division, including the parts of the cosmos. It may be somewhat more daring to assume that kṣatrá- can take a genitive of what is ruled over -- I do not now have parallels -- but keep in mind that the root √kṣā from which kṣatrá- is derived regularly takes such a genitive. If my interpr. is correct, the vidátha- refers to the cosmic divisions produced by the 1st creation.

As noted in the publ. intro., a number of referents have been suggested for the two sons of heaven, and as I also said there, I think this is missing the point. We remain in the realm of the 1st creation where entities may begin to proliferate but they are still not named. I suggested there that the two may be the two world halves (note that kṣatrá- was associated with them in vs. 3b and see 8c below), but it is also quite possible that the focus should be on the “two,” not on who exactly the two are: the first splitting of the primal unity.
