I reverently invoke Heaven and Earth, to be first in their thought; (I  reverently invoke) Agni and the very bright gharma drink, for (the  
Aśvins) to seek on their journey.  
Those with which you stimulate the decisive act in the match, for (us to  gain) a share—with those forms of help come here, o Aśvins.
