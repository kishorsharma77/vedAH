For brief and unilluminating comments on śikṣānará- see comm. ad I.53.2.

Here I prefer to read the loc samithéṣu with it rather than with what follows.

The root noun cmpd. prahā́- is discussed with care and insight by Scar (698- 700). The cmpd. is found in X.42.9 in a clear gambling context. Of the various proposals Scar makes, I find most satisfying the one in which prahā́- is the stakes/pool/kitty ‘left out in front’. The possessive adj. here would then mean ‘having the jackpot’ and would fit with the gambling imagery in 3d śvaghnī́va … sanáye dhánānām “like (a gambler) with the best throw to gain the stakes.” (Scar, however, takes our particular passage in a different and, to me, unconvincing direction, p.

700.) The standard interpr. is ‘take the lead’ (e.g., Ge “den Vorsprung gewinnend”) in a race, but I’m not sure how this meaning would develop from ‘leave’ and ‘forth’.
