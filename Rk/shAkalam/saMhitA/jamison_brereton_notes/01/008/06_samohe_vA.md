The whole verse is a relative clause with accented verb (yá ā́śata), with no overt antecedent available in either the preceding or the following vs. My solution follows Old, who suggests that it implicitly hangs off vs. 5: Indra’s power is (for those) who… This fits the message of the hymn, that men’s success is entirely dependent on Indra’s aid and intervention, a message that is reinforced by the interdependence of various vss. already noted (1-2 [main cl., rel. cl.], 2-3 [lexical concatenation]) and to be described below [7-10].

Though ā́śata lacks expressed obj., ‘him’ (=Indra) should be supplied, on the basis of passages like I.85.7, VIII.97.9.

In the publ. tr. I follow Gr’s deriv. of samohá- from sám √ūh ‘shove together’, but I now think that it is better analyzed as sa-mohá- to √muh ‘be confused’ (see comm. ad IV.17.13) and would slightly modify the tr. here to “in the confusion (of battle).”
