The opening of this vs., stuṣé, is identical to the beginning of VI.49 and very similar to the beginning of VI.50 (huvé), both of which vss. (VI.49.1, VI.50.1) contain the divine list discussed in the next paragraph.

We have already had occasion to note (comm. ad VI.49.1, 50.1) the unexpected trio Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, in which Agni substitutes for expected Aryaman. Here we have a different third member: Aditi, Mitra, Varuṇa (áditim mitráṃ váruṇam), opening rather than closing the pāda. Of course, as their mother, Aditi has a closer connection to Mitra and Varuṇa than Agni does, but in fact she is rarely found in their immediate company: only in the voc. phrase II.27.14 ádite mítra váruṇotá also pāda-init. and in a larger list of gods in V.46.3. In our passage the missing Aryaman is added at the beginning of the next pāda (3c), just as he was added in the pāda (c) immediately following the list in VI.50.1b. Note that in VI.50.1 áditim precedes the trio in the first pāda of the vs. (VI.50.1a).

In pāda a I take maháḥ as an acc. pl., contra the standard tr. (Ge, Re, Scar 291) “herdmen of great truth.” Either is of course grammatically and semantically possible, but I was influenced by the undoubted acc. pl. maháḥ also referring to the gods in the next vs. (4b) as well as 9d.

The vaḥ in pāda a is ambig. With the standard tr. (Ge, Re, Scar 291), I take it as referring to the gods in the 2nd ps. On the other hand, references to the gods have so far been in the 3rd ps. and will remain so in the next vs.; 2nd ps. address only appears in vs. 5. So it would be equally possible to take vaḥ as an instance of the common practice of a poet addressing his priestly comrades, “I will praise, for you/on your behalf, the great herdsmen of truth …” Nothing much hangs on the difference, nor is there any way to determine which is correct.

Note that ádabdha-dhītīn ‘having undeceivable inspired thoughts’ at the end of c echoes áditim beginning b, despite the differences in lexicon and even segmentation. It also is responsive with ṛtá-dhītayaḥ ‘having truth as inspired thoughts’ in 10d, and the two form part of the ring around the omphalos vss. 6-7.

While ádabdha- is taken up by ádabdhān in 4a.

For sadhanyàḥ I now favor the scenario sketched by Scar (291) as an alternative to the analysis as belonging to a root noun cmpd. sadha-nī́-. See comm. ad IV.1.9. As noted there, Scar begins with a sa-dhána- ‘common wealth’ to which a

*sadhaní- ‘sharer in common wealth’ à ‘companion’ could be formed. He then
suggests that because of a perceived connection with √nī, the stem was reinterpreted and reformed as sadhanī́-. Although this requires more machinery than simply taking it as a root noun cmpd. to √nī in the first place, the semantics of that supposed cmpd.

are somewhat troublesome; moreover the stem sadhanitvá- can be more easily derived by this route. MLW alternatively suggests that the stem is a vṛkī deriv. to sadhána-. This would account for the morphology more easily that what was just sketched; however, it would have to be masc. vṛkī form. Not impossible of course (cf. rathī́-), but one more required assumption.
