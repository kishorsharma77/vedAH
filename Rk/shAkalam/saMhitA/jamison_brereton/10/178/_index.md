Tārksyạ
Ariṣṭanemi Tārkṣya
3 verses: triṣṭubh
A being named Tārkṣya is found in a few other places in Vedic literature, with  varying identities. Here it seems to be the name of a prodigious and mythical  racehorse, much like Dadhikrā(van) (see IV.38–40); indeed verse 3 here is a vari ant of the Dadhikrā verse IV.38.10. Both horses are associated with Trasadasyu,  leader of the Pūrus: his association with Dadhikrā is announced directly in the first  Dadhikrā verse (IV.38.1), whereas his association with Tārkṣya is mediated through  the horse’s name, which is a vr̥ddhi derivative of Tr̥kṣi, himself a descendant of  Trasadasyu (see VIII.22.7, see also VI.46.8).
