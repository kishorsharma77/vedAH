Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
8 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn shares some phraseology and themes with the immediately preceding  IV.7, especially Agni’s role as messenger, but it is far less complex than that hymn.  It is also unlike that hymn in its prayers for rich goods from Agni in exchange for  ritual service.
## 1
Your messenger, affording all possessions, immortal oblation-bearer, best sacrificer—I will aim straight toward him with a hymn.
## 2
For he knows the depository of goods; the great one knows the means of  ascending to heaven.
He will convey the gods hither.
## 3
He, the god, knows how to bow the gods here to the house for him who  acts with truth.
He will give especially dear goods.
## 4
He is Hotar, and he, understanding his mission, speeds between (heaven  and earth),
knowing the means of ascending to heaven.
## 5
May we, who have done pious service for Agni by giving oblations,  be those
who, thriving, kindle him.
## 6
They become far famed as winners through their wealth, they through  their masses of heroes,
who have placed their friendship in Agni.
## 7
On us may the riches craved by many converge day after day;
to us may prizes move.
## 8
He, the inspired poet of the settled domains, of the sons of Manu, by his  vast power
pierces through (obstacles) as if with the snap (of a bow [string]).
