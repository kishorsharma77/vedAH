Despite the use of √kṛ ‘make’ (2nd pl. pf. cakra), it is not likely that the Maruts created the ukthā́ni themselves, though they are singers on other occasions; rather they provided the occasion and the subject for the poets of earlier eras to celebrate them. Though Re’s ‘provoke’ is a bit strong, it’s the right idea. My ‘have given rise to’ is a bit weak.
