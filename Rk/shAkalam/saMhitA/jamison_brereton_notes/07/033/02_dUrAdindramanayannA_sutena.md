In this vs. the perspective and location shifts from Indra, at the competing sacrifice announcing his intention to go to the Vasiṣṭhas, to the Vasiṣṭhas at their place of sacrifice “leading” Indra to them. The vss. are linked by dūrā́t ‘from a 38 distance’ (1d, 2a), in 1d referring to the distant location of the Vasiṣṭha from Indra’s point of view, in 2a the distant location of Indra from that of the Vasiṣṭhas.

With Old, I consider Pāśadyumna Vāyata the hapless sacrificer whom Indra deserted in favor of the Vasiṣṭhas. But I do not follow Old in thinking that b describes an intermediate place on Indra’s journey from PV to the Vasiṣṭhas.
