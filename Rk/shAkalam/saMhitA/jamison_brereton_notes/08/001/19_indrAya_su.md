The second hemistich contains a slight reversal of expectations: śakrá- is a standard epithet of Indra, who must be the subject of pīpayat (unless we read loc. śakre, not nom. śakraḥ with Pp.). But we do not expect Indra to swell the soma drink

- if anything the reverse. (In fact, Gr suggests that śakrá- modifies soma in just this
instance.) I think we must take Indra as the indirect agent of the swelling of soma: by his presence at the sacrifice he causes the sacrificers to press and mix the soma with water and milk, thus swelling it. See Old on this verse.
