Both Ge and Re take ajáram with suvī́ryam (e.g., “die unbeugsame Herrschaft, das nicht verwelkende Heldentum”), while I take it with kṣátram. The Ge/Re interpr. is perfectly possible, and there are no grammatical or syntactic features to allow a clear decision. My interpr. is based on the rhetorical arg. that the two privative adjectives (ánāmi and ajáram) belong together, but I can also see that rhetoric might also favor parallel phrases: PRIV-ADJ. X, PRIV-ADJ. Y. My other, quite faint, consideration was that the adj. ajára- was used of the king (=Agni) in the previous vs. (rājan … ajara) and would transfer easily from the king to his dominion (kṣatrá-).
