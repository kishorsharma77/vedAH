íbhya- is found only here in the RV, though it occurs later. It is a derivative of íbha-, which is slightly better attested in the RV and seems to mean ‘(group of) servants, retinue’. Tr. of íbhyān split dramatically between ‘wealthy’ (Ge “die Reichen,” WG “die Begüterten”) and ‘vassal, servant’ (Re “les vassaux”), and the Pāli cognate ibbha- is also glossed with both, though with the ‘vassal’ sense first and dominant (see the newest ed. of the PTS dictionary, 2001 s.v.: “a member of a king’s entourage; a vassal; dependent; wealthy”). I will not enter into a reexamination of all the Sanskrit and MIA evidence, but in my opinion context here favors ‘vassal, dependent’ rather than ‘wealthy’. See Proferes’s disc. of vss. 7-9 (2007: 111-12); although he refuses to tr. íbhyān, he argues that it refers “to those who are subordinated to the king,” quite possibly the clans — as the AV passage he adduces suggests: AV IV.22.7 víśo addhi “eat the clans,” addressed to the king at his consecration.
