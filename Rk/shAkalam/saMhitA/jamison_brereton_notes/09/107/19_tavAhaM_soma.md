The indic. pf. of √ran is presential in value; see Kü (413). The form here echoes raṇyati in 18b.

The lexeme ní √car (or ní áva √car) is found nowhere else in the RV or later.

The context clearly requires a negative sense; I’ve used the colloquial English idiom “get (s.o.) down,” meaning ‘discourage, demoralize’. There are two ways to interpr.

áva at the end of the pāda. With Gr (and implicitly Ge and Re), I take it as a 2nd preverb with caranti. Since ní and áva both mean ‘down’, it reinforces by variation, hence my “—way down.” As Ge reports (n. 19c), Ludwig takes áva rather as the impv. to √av ‘help’, accented because it starts a new clause. This is perfectly possible and would fit the context, but I prefer the more unusual semantic doubling of the preverbs in this emotional context.

There are various suggestions about what to supply with purū́ṇi: Sāy. rákṣāṃsi, fld. tentatively by Ge (“böse Geister?”), Re “choses (dangereuses).” Leaving it open seems to me the better solution: the poet is besieged by multiple things he cannot even name.

In the last pāda it is Soma who is urged to “go past the barriers” (paridhī́n); we might have expected the poet to ask Soma for help in getting past them himself (but see next vs.). For Soma’s journey past the paridhī́n Ge and Re cite IX.96.11 paridhī́m̐r áporṇu “open up the barriers.” In both passages the paridhí- are presumably obstacles to Soma’s progress on his ritual journey, perhaps the tufts of the fleece filter.
