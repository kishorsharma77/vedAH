Although the prātár of vs. 1 and 2a has disappeared, this vs. seems to contain a reminiscence of it: 1c #prātár bhágam is echoed by 3a #bhága prá(ṇe)tar (in opposite order), and pādas c and d then pick up prá ṇ(etar) of 3a in #bhága prá ṇo and #bhága prá nṛ́bhiḥ (latter without retroflexion). This is hardly the most sophisticated effect in Rigvedic poetry, but it is an illustration of the subtle concatenative effects that can provide unity and a throughline in even the most banal (as this hymn mostly is) composition.
