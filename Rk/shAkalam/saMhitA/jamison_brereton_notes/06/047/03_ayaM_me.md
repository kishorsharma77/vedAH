It is not clear what noun to supply with fem. pl. urvī́ḥ, though something like ‘worlds (so Ge), realms’ makes sense. The same ṣáḍ urvī́ḥ is found in X.14.16 in unclear context, and as a voc. in X.128.5 dévīḥ ṣaḍ urvīḥ 'you six broad goddesses’, again with uncertain referent. Elsewhere urvī́ḥ applies to waters or rivers, but liquid doesn’t seem appropriate here. Perhaps in our vs. it’s evoking a pl. of pṛthivī́ ‘earth’, with a pun on a different word for ‘broad’, urú-, urvī́-. Note that pṛthivī́- occurs in the next vs., dependent on varimán- ‘expanse’, which is derivationally related to urú-.
