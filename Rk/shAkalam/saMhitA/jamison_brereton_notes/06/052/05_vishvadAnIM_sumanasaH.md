Another pres. part. uccárantam ‘rising’.

Ge and Re interpr. devā́n as a truncated gen. pl., which would be esp. unusual in pāda-initial position (pāda-final being at least arguably more plausible, since truncation and the adjustment of cadences in different meters are possible factors).

Old seems to take this interpr. as tantamount to a moral lapse (“… scheint mir Verlassen des geraden Weges”). He takes it as the acc. pl. it appears to be, but construes it with ā́gamiṣṭhaḥ (“der den Göttern am besten mit Hilfe beispringt”).

Although this is syntactically possible, it is semantically unlikely: Indra, who by the evidence of the repeated and expanded phrase in 6a is clearly the subject, is most welcome to come to us; I doubt if we care whether the gods hope for his arrival or not. My own solution is somewhat dodgy: I take óhānaḥ as a pass. part. ‘being lauded as’ with the venerable formulaic phrase vásupatir vásūnām “goods-lord of goods” as the title given by the laud (so far so good), with devā́n a loosely relational acc., almost an acc. of extent: “(lauded) over/across the (other) gods.” (Ge’s and Re’s interpr. of vásupatir vásūnām and óhānaḥ vary, and I will not detail them here.)
