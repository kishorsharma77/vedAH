On the surprise ending here and the splitting up of what was throughout the rest of the hymn an indissoluble pair, see publ. intro. The first pāda keeps the two as a pair, with dual verbs jigyathuḥ and jayethe asserting that both won and both did not lose the contest. The audience would first take this as meaning they did not lose to their (joint) opponent. But in b we have the first splitting of the pair into two (implied) singulars (ná … katarás canaínoḥ “neither one of these two”), which could raise the possibility that they were contending with each other -- but paradoxically neither one lost. Their mutual contention is then made explicit in pāda c, with, inter alia, a reverse Vāyav Indraś ca construction (índraś ca viṣṇo) serving as the subj. of a dual verb (ápasṛdhethām), which in the middle voice refers to mutual conflict, and the final pāda explains (or implies) how in such a situation neither one lost: the 1000 (cows) were split into three parts, and as later Vedic texts indicate, Indra got twothirds and Viṣṇu one-third. It may be that the reversal of the Vāyav Indraś ca construction, which puts índraḥ in first position, also signals his relative, but not complete, dominance in this story.
