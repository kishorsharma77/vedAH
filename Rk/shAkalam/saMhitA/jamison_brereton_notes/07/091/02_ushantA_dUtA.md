Ge (n. 2a) suggests that ná in pāda a stands for haplologized *ná ná, with both the simile particle (“Willig wie Boten”) and the negative (“… nicht zu hintergehen”). Certainly it must represent the negative with infinitival dat., since ná dábhāya occurs twice elsewhere (V.44.3, IX.73.8) with gopá-, but it is less clear that we need the simile marker. Though Indra and Vāyu are probably not technically messengers in the way that Agni is, I see no real problem in identifying them thus 113 when they come to the sacrifice from the heavenly world, rather than simply comparing them to messengers.

I do not entirely understand why pātháḥ is accented, and, unusually, Old makes no comment in the Noten. I assume that it falls roughly in the category of expressions with a single verb and “zwei Subjekten, Objekten u. s. w.” (specifically here the u. s. w.) treated in Old’s lengthy article on Verbalenklisis in the Rig Veda (ZDMG 60 [1906]:707-41 = KlSch 182-216; cited phrase p. 708=183), though in a rather cursory scan of the article I did not find this passage. The triggering phrase here would be māsáś ca … śarádaś ca pūrvī́ḥ “though the months and many autumns,” with the accented verb in the middle, even though the conjoined NPs are not contrastive.

Ge tr. the just cited phrase with “viele Monaten und Herbst,” though technically speaking fem. pūrvī́ḥ can only modify śarádaḥ, to which it is also adjacent. Klein (DGRV I.134) echoes Ge’s interpr. forcefully (“… must be taken with both conjoined nouns” [my ital.]), and no doubt this is the ultimate intent, though I find preferable the rendering that matches the grammar (so also Re without comment).
