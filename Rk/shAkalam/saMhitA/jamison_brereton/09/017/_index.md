Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
8 verses: gāyatrī  
A straightforward hymn: the soma juices flow quickly on their journey through the  filter into the vessels and thence to Indra and the gods, a journey compared to that  of the sun. The role of speech in the soma sacrifice is also emphasized, with soma  both inspiring speech and being strengthened by it.
