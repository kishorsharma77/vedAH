This verse plays a minor syntactic trick. It consists of a string of acc. sg.

masc. qualifiers; since the previous vs. also consists largely of an acc. sg. masc. NP headed by vīrám, the audience would be likely to assume that the new series of grammatically matching adjectives are also qualifiers of vīrám, esp. since this type of syntactic dependence between verses is not uncommon in the RV. It is only when we arrive at the middle of the final pāda that we encounter tvā́m and discover that the accusatives of this verse refer to Soma, not to the hero he gives us in 22.

Ge accounts for the curious hapax bhareṣu-jā́- ‘born at raids’ by the fact that soma is especially offered before battle. This is probably correct, though the semantics could be tighter. Scar essentially accepts this explanation and cites III.51.8 (of soma) jātám … mahé bhárāya, though he explores some other possibilities as well.
