My interpretation of pāda a is quite different from Ge’s and starts from the rhetorical structure of the four questions in vss. 9-10. Three of these (9ab, 9cd, 10b) are negative questions, in which the negative is part of the predicate: 9a ákr̥tam, 9c ná śuśruve, 10b ástrtam̥ . 10a also contains a negation, ádhṛṣtāḥ, but in Ge’s tr. it is not predicated: “Was sind seine grossen, unangreifbaren Kräfte?” Furthermore his tr.

implicitly equates neut. sg. kád with fem. pl. táviṣīḥ. These problems can be fixed by taking kád as a question marker, not an interrogative pronoun, and by assuming that the powers in question are not Indra’s (as Ge takes them), but those of Indra’s enemies. The implied answer to the rhetorical question is “no, there exist no powers that Indra can’t assail.” For táviṣī belonging to others, see, e.g., I.80.10 índro vṛtrásya táviṣīṃ nír ahan … The hapax bekanā́ṭa- is an almost textbook example of non-Indo-Aryan phonology (see Kuiper, Aryans), and it seems safest to take it as the name of a people, rather than in the traditional interpretation (going back to the Nirukta VI.26 bekanāṭāḥ khalu kusīdino bhavanti) as “Wucherer” (usurer, profiteer) as Ge does.

ápūrvyā [sic, not, as in Aufrecht and HvN, ápūrvya] and purūtámāsaḥ play off each other. We may be the latest of many, but our formulations have no predecessors - a variation on the usual theme of the “newest hymn.”
