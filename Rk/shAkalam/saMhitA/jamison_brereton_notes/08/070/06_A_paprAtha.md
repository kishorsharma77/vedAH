Ge takes the loc. gómati vrajé as a loc. absolute (“wenn es sich um rindergefüllte Hürde handelt”). By using the Engl. idiom “help someone to something” I may be stretching Sanskrit syntax further than is legitimate. Though see Gr, definition 4 s.v. av: “jemandem [A.] wozu [D., L.] verhelfen.” Unfortunately this is the only passage he places under that rubric with a loc.; the others have datives.

However, in Rivelex vol. I the Deep Case Frame for avi , subsection 1d / 1da, tags a number of other possible such passages with this structure (not all of which I would so interpret).
