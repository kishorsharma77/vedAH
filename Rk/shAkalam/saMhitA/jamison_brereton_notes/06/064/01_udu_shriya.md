supátha- and sugá- recur in 4a, conjoined by utá.

Note the phonological reciprocity between víśvā and vásvī in the same metrical position in c and d respectively. The latter is, of course, simply the fem. to vásu- ‘good, goods’, and here it must make at least partial reference to the goods Dawn disburses, she being here the Dakṣiṇā, priestly gift, personified. This could have been better conveyed in the publ. tr. by ‘goodly’ rather than just ‘good’. I think there may also be a buried grammatical pun, for, if there existed such a stem, the -in-stem possessive to vásu- should be *vasvín- ‘possessing goods’, with nom. sg. *vasvī́, differing from our form only by accent.

It would be possible to construe pāda with abhūt and a pred. nom.: “she has become the goodly priestly gift …” But it is common in Dawn hymns to announce the arrival of Dawn in the first verse, and an annunciatory “she has appeared” (< “come into being”) is more in harmony with the usual practice of Dawn hymns. This is the tack of the standard tr. (Ge, Re; see also Gonda [Ved. Lit. 218]).
