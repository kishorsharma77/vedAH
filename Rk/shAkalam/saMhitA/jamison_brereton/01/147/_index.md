Agni
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is a departure from Dīrghatamas’s focus in previous Agni hymns on  the creation and spread of the ritual fire. Though it begins in a ritual situation (vs.  1) and the poet commends his ritual speech to Agni in the first half of verse 2, the  poet then becomes preoccupied with potential hostilities directed against him by  malevolent and dishonest men and how to foil them. He counts upon the protec
tors deployed by Agni (vs. 3), who may well be the flames referred to in verse 1, and  more generally assumes that well-performed worship of Agni will enlist that god in  his protection. Who the hostile mortals are is not made clear, though in a R̥gvedic  ritual context rival sacrificers are the most likely culprits.324 I.148
The insistence on the cheating and duplicity of these rivals and the general  embattled but combative tone of these verses remind us somewhat of similarly con tentious passages in the Old Avestan Gāthās attributed to Zarathustra.
It is also worth noting that this is the first time in the Dīrghatamas cycle that he  refers to himself by name, that is, by his metronymic Māmateya (vs. 3).
