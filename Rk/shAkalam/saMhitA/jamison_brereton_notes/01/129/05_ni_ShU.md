I borrow śátru- ‘rival’ from 4fg to construe with the indefinite káyasya cid; cf. VIII.25.15 … vanúṣaḥ … abhímātiṃ káyasya cid “the arrogance of every zealot.” The phrase téjiṣṭhābhir aráṇibhiḥ “with piercingly hot kindling sticks” appears in Paruchepa’s I.127.4, which suggests that this phrase must constitute the simile and the ná is displaced to the right as in 1g. (WG try to avoid this difficulty by construing téjiṣṭhābhiḥ first with ūtíbhiḥ, but the nearby parallel makes that unlikely.) The relation between d and e is not clear. Ge makes e part of the yáthā clause, but purā́seems to call for a past tense and mányase is a present. Moreover, as Old points out, yáthā purā́is a common self-contained tag. The problem, though, is that mányase is accented. Old suggests that it is accented because the clause is by its nature a Nebensatz. The publ. tr. should probably have signaled this by “(in that)” vel sim.

What is going on in f is unclear, since, as Ge points out, Pūru is depicted in a positive light in other nearby Paruchepa passages (I.130.7, 131.4). He suggests supplying énāṃsi with víśvāni, flg. Sāy, thus “carry away all (the guilts) from Pūru.” But this won’t work with g (as it should in the Atyaṣṭi template), because the guilt would be coming to us. Perhaps the poet is urging Indra to redistribute the goods of the patron (Pūru) to us.

This verse is one of the very few places in the Atyaṣṭi series in which the strict verbal repetition at the end of fg is breached (see also the next vs.). Here váhniḥ should be final in the pāda, but has been displaced by no ácha. I have no real explanation for this, save for the fact that when no ácha are adjacent they go last (I.165.3, III.35.1, IV.34.10), but this hardly seems a sufficient reason.

The g pāda is a syllable too short. I suggest that the simile particle ná has been haplologized in the sequence āsā́váhnir *ná no ácha. The descriptor āsā́váhni- (X.115.3) or more usually váhni- āsā́(I.76.4, VI.11.2, VI.19.9) ‘conveyor by mouth’ is otherwise used of Agni, which makes ritual sense; here, without the simile particle, it would have to be applied to Indra, which does not (hence Ge’s diluted “Wortführer”). If I am correct, this is another example of a displaced ná simile marker; of course in this case āsā́váhniḥ would be a quasi-compound ‘conveyor-bymouth’.
