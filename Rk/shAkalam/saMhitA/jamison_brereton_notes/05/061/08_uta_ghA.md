On vaíradeya-, lit. ‘what is to be given for a man/hero’, as Wergeld or blood money, see Roth (ZDMG 41: 672-76) and Macdonell-Keith Vedic Index s.v. vaira.

Another indirect ref. to the same phenomenon is found in II.32.4 vīráṃ śatádāyam “a hero (for whom) a hundred (cows) are to be given.” In our case the person in question is hardly worth the name ‘man’ and would be better off dead than alive, since his relatives would still receive the standard recompense for a vīrá, whatever his personal failings had been. It is telling that he is called a paṇí- ‘niggard’, a reminder to Śyāvāśva’s patron that stinginess is a grave flaw.
