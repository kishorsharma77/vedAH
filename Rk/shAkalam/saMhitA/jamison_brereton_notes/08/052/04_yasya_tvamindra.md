This verse is structurally a mess. It seems at first to have made the same shift of the referent of the relative pronoun from Indra (vs. 3) to Indra’s client (vs. 4) as was made in the preceding hymn in vs. 6: yásya stómeṣu “in whose praises” refers to the praiser. But the resumptive pronoun tám refers not to the praiser but to Indra, as the phrase táṃ tvā makes explicit, and the single praiser of 4a, implicitly in the 3rd person (though see Scar 225, who supplies “Zu mir”), corresponds to the 1st pl.

vayám in c.

Ge (followed by Scar 225) takes vā́je as part of the voc. phrase in b: “du im Kampf Sieghafter, Ratreicher.” This is possible, I suppose, and even favored by the pāda boundary, but I take it as one of those locative absolutes without expressed participle, like common dháne “when the stake (is set).”
