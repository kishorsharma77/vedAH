Although most tr. take the “child of mist” to be the rain, its physical description here (“long and wide”) makes better sense for a cloud.

ámṛdhra- normally means ‘not neglectful, not slighting’, but this doesn’t yield much sense here. I therefore take it in the passive sense ‘not (to be) neglected / slighted’; English “not negligible” provides a perfect idiomatic counterpart.
