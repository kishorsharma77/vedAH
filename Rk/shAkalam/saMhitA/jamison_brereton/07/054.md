Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi

This short hymn (but also see the first verse of the next one) is addressed to the  personified guardian spirit of the house and household and in later ritual is recited  for entry into a new house.
## 1
O Lord of the Dwelling Place, greet us. Become easy to enter and  without affliction for us.
When we entreat you, favor us in return: become weal for our
two-footed, weal for our four-footed. 2. O Lord of the Dwelling Place, be one who furthers us, fattening the  livestock with cows, with horses, o drop.
In your companionship might we be unaging. Like a father his sons,  favor us in return.
## 3
O Lord of the Dwelling Place, might we be accompanied by your capable  fellowship, joy-bringing, providing the way.
Protect us at will in peace and war. – Do you protect us always with your  blessings.
