All Gods
R̥jiśvan Bhāradvāja
15 verses: triṣṭubh, except śakvarī 15
A hymn of straightforward structure, typical of many All God hymns: each verse  praises a single god (or divine entity, like the pair Night and Dawn [vs. 3] or the  group of Maruts [vs.  11]). Most verses name the god in question, though the  name can be postponed till late in the verse, as in verse 2 dedicated to Agni or  verse 8 to Pūṣan, whose name is the last word in the verse. Two do not name the  god at all: verse 3 to Night and Dawn and verse 12 to Indra. The riddling tech
nique of postponing or omitting the name of an entity defined by the verse is of  course common in R̥gvedic rhetoric, and its use in All God catalogues is especially  appropriate.
There is no obvious ritual or other significance to the order of gods in this hymn,  though many of the parties to the Morning Pressing occur early in the hymn: Agni  (vs. 2), Night and Dawn (vs. 3), Vāyu (vs. 4), Aśvins (vs. 5). On the other hand, the  verse dedicated to Indra (12), a regular participant in the dawn ritual, is late in the  hymn, though he is obliquely present, with the Maruts, in 6cd. No god receives  more than a single verse, though, as just mentioned, Indra and the Maruts have a  presence in the Parjanya and Vāta [=Thunder and Wind] verse (6), as Agni does

in the Mitra and Varuṇa verse (1) and in the Tvaṣṭar verse (9). The reference shifts  between the 3rd and 2nd person, with the former predominating. The final verse of  the hymn, in a slightly different meter (triṣṭubh but with an extra pāda), mentions  no specific gods, but asks all of them for benefits.
