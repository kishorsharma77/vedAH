It may not be clear in the publ. tr. that it is the horse that is bedecked (prā́vṛtasya), not the goat.

viśvárūpa- modifying the goat in c is taken by most as a bland color term (Ge/WG ‘allfarbig’, Doniger ‘dappled’), but, esp. because in the next vs. (3b) the goat is called viśvádevya-, I think the qualifier is meant to convey more meaning: perhaps to indicate that the goat stands for all the other animals (which, as disc. in the publ. intro., are literally tied up for sacrifice in the later versions of the Aśvamedha), hence my “representing all forms.”
