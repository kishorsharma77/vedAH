(Praügaśastra continued) As in I.2 the recipients of the various tṛcas are emphatically signalled. In vss.

1-3 to the Aśvins, the voc. áśvinā opens the first two verses, while their alternative name nāsatyā opens the second pāda of the third. The voc. índra opens all three verses of the next tṛca (4-6). The Viśvedevāḥ tṛca contains three instances of that phrase: the voc. in 7b, nominatives opening vss. 8 and 9. The final tṛca to Sarasvatī likewise contains three occurrences of her name in the nominative, but all three end their pādas (10a, 11c, 12a).
