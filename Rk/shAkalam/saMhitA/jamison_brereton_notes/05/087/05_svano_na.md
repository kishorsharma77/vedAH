Note the chiastic phonetic figure that begins the vs.: svanó ná vo.

The caus. injunc. rejayat needs an obj. I supply ‘earth’ on the basis of intrans.

rejate passages with bhū́mi-, pṛthivī́, et sim. as subj., but any standard cosmic feature will do (Re ‘l’univers’, WG ‘alles’).

Pace Gr, ṛñjáta is better analyzed as a 3rd pl. mid. athem. form than a 2nd pl.

act. them. All the standard tr. follow the 3rd pl. mid. interpr.

The source of sthā́raśman- is disputed. First note that this peculiar form can be partially motivated contextually: 6c begins sthā́tāro, so there was some incentive to begin our pāda with a word of similar shape. We can begin by dismissing the odd Pp analysis of this cmpd, sthāḥ’raśman-. It is difficult to know what this is meant to represent. AiG II.1.316 and II.2.9 take sthā́- simply as the cmpded root or root noun, which would be a highly unusual cmpd. type. Bloomfield (RVReps ad loc.) suggests that it’s “a kind of haplology” from sth(ir)ā́raśmānaḥ, with sthirá- ‘firm’ as 1st member (note Sāy.’s gloss sthiraraśmayo), and this is accepted by Ge (n. 5d). It is not clear where the long ā- of his posited sth(ir)ā́- would come from, however; is he thinking of a nom. pl. syntagm *sthirā́raśmā́naḥ, with univerbation and loss of the noun’s accent? Moreover, in the Nachtr. to AiG II.1.316 [=Nachtr. 87] Debrunner points out that haplology of Bl’s posited form should produce *sthirā̆śman- (undoubtedly why Bl calls it “a kind of haplology”). Re proposes a 1st member adj.

*sthāmán- ‘bien en place’ or ‘solide’, internally derived from the noun sthā́man-
‘station, standing place’, but this requires several more steps derivationally and semantically, and the haplology (if that’s what he sees it as) would involve loss over an intermediate syllable and loss of a heavy consonant-final syllable, both of which are problematic: sthāmán-raśman-. Certainly sthirá- makes the most sense semantically, but, as noted above, Bl’s haplology runs into formal difficulties.

However, if we begin with my observation that 6c #sthā́tāro makes a sthā opening desirable, an irregular reduction of *sthirá-raśman- may be the best option. In fact if we operate with a slightly different form of the 1st member, the development may be easier to explain. I suggest positing a reduced form of sthirá-, namely *sthrá-, showing the same -irV- ∼ -rV- alternation as índra- ∼ *índira- (metrically guaranteed, but not transmitted in the Saṃhitā; cf. AiG I.55) and the 3rd pl. med. pf. endings -ire and -re (AiG I.23). *sthrá- would thus show the loss of an apparent svarabhakti vowel, rather than the insertion of one. The posited cmpd *sthrá-raśman- would then undergo liquid dissimilation, not haplology. This still doesn’t explain the long ā́-, but the parallel sthā́tāraḥ might help there.
