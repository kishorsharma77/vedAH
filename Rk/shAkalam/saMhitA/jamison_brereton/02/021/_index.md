Indra  
Gr̥tsamada  
6 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 6  
In its first three verses the hymn announces the various offerings to Indra: the soma,  the homage, and the proclamation of Indra’s heroic deeds. The god merits these  because of his overwhelming power to defeat any who stand in his way and to win whatever he wishes. In verses 4–5, the poet recalls the Vala story, in which Indra and  his priestly allies obtained the cattle and the dawns through the hymns that both the  priests and Indra recite. He ends with an appeal that his people will find the intel lectual ability that will allow them both to continue to implore the gods successfully  and to gain the wealth and safety that will flow from that ability.
