As discussed in several places in the comm. (see lexical list), the root √vañc refers to a number of types of non-linear motion: undulate, curl, coil, etc., with these meanings also distributed among the derivatives of the root, esp. vákvan-. Here my tr. ‘billowing’ refers to the motion of the waves of the liquid soma; cf. X.148.5 ūrmír ná … vákvāḥ “billowing like a wave.” The publ. tr. doesn’t adequately represent the two divergent derivatives of √man ‘think, bring to mind’, manótar- and manīṣī́. The latter, by itself, means ‘possessing inspired thought, inspired thinker’. The former, a rarer derivative, means, in my view, someone who pays mental attention, a ‘minder’. See comm. ad II.9.4. I would emend the tr. here to “the minder, the foremost inspired thinker with his insight.” The point here, I think, is that Soma not only has inspired thoughts of his own but pays attention to those of the human celebrants.

The ten sisters are, as usual, the fingers of the officiant.
