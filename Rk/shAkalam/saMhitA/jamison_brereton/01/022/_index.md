Medhātithi Kāṇva
21 verses: gāyatrī
The Medhātithi group ends with two lengthy hymns to a variety of divini ties:  the ascriptions of the Anukramaṇī are reproduced above. As Oldenberg  points out (1888: 224–25; Noten ad loc.), both hymns can easily be broken down  into smaller hymns, which then conform to the principles of arrangement in the  Saṃhitā. The clear changes of divinity support the division of this hymn into  smaller units, although Oldenberg’s divisions do not altogether match those  of the Anukramaṇī; Oldenberg’s are clearly superior:  1–4, 5–8, 9–12, 13–15,  16–18, 19–21.
Like the immediately preceding hymn, the first sections of this one are pri marily devoted to invocation of the various gods:  the Aśvins in verses 1–4,  Savitar in 5–8. In a slight variation on this theme, in verses 9–12 Agni is called  upon to bring Tvaṣṭar and the Wives of the Gods to the sacrifice; this divine  group figures in a number of minor rites in the Soma Sacrifice (especially  the Third Pressing) and elsewhere. The next three verses (13–15) concern  Heaven and Earth; the middle verse (14) is the only truly enigmatic one in  the hymn. The final six verses (16–21) consist of two tr̥cas to Viṣṇu, which,  both by the principles of arrangement and by their phraseology, should be  considered two separate hymns. There is no obvious reason, either ritual or  mythological, for collecting these particular short compositions in a single  super-hymn. As Oldenberg argues, the grouping and order seem to be entirely  mechanical.
