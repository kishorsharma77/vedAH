This 2nd vs. in the truth-formulation sequence both continues the mystical description of the dawn sacrifice and presents another paradox. With regard to the sacrifice, the milk produced in vs. 9 becomes the butter oblation poured on the sacrificial fire, as Ge discusses. Ge’s explanation of the phrase páyasā pṛṣṭhyèna lit.

“the milk belonging to the back” is ingenious and (to me) convincing: it is the milk on the top (the image is of a four-legged animal), i.e., the cream, which is made into butter. With the offering of the butter, the fire flames up -- allowing it to go about “conferring vigor” (vayodhā́-) in c.

Pāda c also inaugurates the paradox that is most clearly expressed in d. Agni is characterized as áspandamāna- in c. As Ge points out (n. 10c), √spand ‘kick, lunge, jerk’ is only used in Vedic of cows when they are being milked, so Agni is both bull (vṛṣabhá- [a], vṛ́ṣan- [d]) and cow. This paradoxical double identity is sharpened in d, where Agni is identified not only as a bull but as Pṛśni, the cow who is the mother of the Maruts, and he is the subj. of the quintessential “cow” verb √duh ‘milk’ and acts on the quintessential cow body part ū́dhar- ‘udder’. The substance s/he produces from this udder is śukrám, a word that can refer not only to ‘gleaming’ milk, but is also used to refer to semen. A similar gender-bending milking scenario involving Pṛśni and Rudra, the Maruts’ father, is found in II.34.2; see that passage and the comm. thereon. Here Agni may be being identified with Rudra; see the AgniRudra equation in vs. 1 and also the focus on Rudra in the “question” vss. (6d, 7b, 7d). There are a number of passages in the Agni hymns of IV that should be brought into the conversation, though unfortunately what they have to say is obscure: see the “gleaming udder” (śúcy ū́dhaḥ) in IV.1.19 and a neut. entity (quite possibly her udder) belonging to Pṛśni in IV.5.7, 10.

What -- if anything -- this refers to naturalistically is unclear. The tendency among interpr. has been to take it as a reference to rain (see Ge n. 10d) or to some other celestial phenomenon (Lü 390), but I find Bloomfield’s suggestion (RR 213) more appropriate to the passage, that the fire, blazing up, “shoots out his flames from his bright udder; he, a bull, is thereby -- mirabile dictu -- also a pṛ̥çni, the heavenly, yielding cow, par excellence.” Bl also suggests that śukrá- here mean ‘semen’, with a zeugma of duduhe: “As a bull he hath spurted semen, as a Pṛ̥çni cow he hath milked his udder.”
