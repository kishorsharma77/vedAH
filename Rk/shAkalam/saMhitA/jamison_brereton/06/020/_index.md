Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
13 verses: triṣṭubh, except virāj 7
Unlike the usual model, this hymn begins with the prayer for gifts from the god (vs.  1). But most of the rest of the hymn is devoted to a verse-by-verse listing of Indra’s  great deeds, not only the standard Vr̥tra (vs. 2) and Vala (vss. 3–4) tales, but also  the defeat of a series of named enemies on behalf of named mortal clients. Some  of these stories are familiar (the Śuṣṇa/Kutsa story, vss. 4–5, and the stealing of  Namuci’s head, vs. 6), and some are mentioned much more rarely (e.g., Vetasu and  Tuji, vs. 8), with unclear details. Many of these same stories are also treated in VI.26.
