This vs. has two passively used participles, suvānáḥ ‘being pressed’ and punānáḥ ‘being purified’, which contrast with the agency implicitly accorded to Soma Pavamāna, “self-purifying” Soma. This more agentive participle returns in the final vs. (30b), just before we ask Soma for his favor.

The repetition of índuḥ (pādas a and c) is somewhat clumsy, but the 2nd occurrences enables the usual word play with adjacent índram.
