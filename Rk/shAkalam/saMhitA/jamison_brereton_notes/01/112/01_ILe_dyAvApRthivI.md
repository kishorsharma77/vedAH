pūrvácitti- is variously interpreted and much discussed: see the long notes of Ge and Re ad loc., as well as Old, KlSch 1152-56 (=NG 1916). The stem always occurs in the dat. and displays (quasi-)infinitival usage. Although it would be possible to take it as “(for me/us) to think first (of them)” and in the first pāda of a hymn this would be easily interpretable as a ritual reference, I consider it to have the opposite value: “(for them) to think first (of me/us).” Kutsa repeatedly calls on Heaven and Earth to be witness to his speech in the refrain of I.105: vittám me asyá rodasī. Cf. also X.35.1 mahī́dyā́vāprthiv ̥ ī́cetatām ápaḥ “Let great Heaven and Earth take cognizance of (our) work.” For further on pūrvácittaye see comm. ad IX.99.5.

The stem iṣṭí- is a perennial problem, since it can belong to several different roots: √iṣ ‘desire, seek’, √iṣ ‘send, impel’, or √yaj ‘sacrifice’. Ge (n. 1b) takes it here to an intransitive iṣ ‘rasch, gern willig kommen, eilen’, though his tr. ‘sich beeilen’ might seem to connect it with a reflexive sense of ‘send, impel’. By isolating iṣṭáye from the acc. gharmám, he then needs to supply another verb to govern that acc., namely “(zu kochen).” Old (KlSch 282-84 [=ZDMG 62 (1908)]), however, gives good reasons to connect our iṣṭáye with ‘seek’, though his interpr. of this pāda differs somewhat from mine. So also Re (see his n.). WG opt for ‘send’.
