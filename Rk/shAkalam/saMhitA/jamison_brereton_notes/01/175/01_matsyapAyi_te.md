The simile and frame in 1ab seem on the surface somewhat flat-footed, and the standard tr. try to fix it one way or another. Both Ge and Re take the simile to be máhaḥ, pā́trasyeva (e.g., Re: “telle la grandeur de la coupe-à-boire”), with mádaḥ the frame (“A été-juste bu … le breuvage-d’ivresse …”). But this requires the simile to straddle the pāda boundary, with the simile marker iva in the wrong place. I think it is instead a sort of reverse simile, with the actual object (mádah ‘exhilarating drink”) put into the simile and the element in the frame what one would expect it to be compared to (máhaḥ ‘might’) “might has been drunk like an exhilarating drink.” Such a poetic trick should not be utilized too often, but the reversal of expectations is a bracing way to begin the hymn.
