As noted in the publ. intro., this verse serves as refrain for VII.28-30, so that it does not respond to (or at least need not respond to) the immediately preceding Varuṇa verse.

In b the genitives mahó rāyáḥ and rā́dhasaḥ may either be parallel or one dependent on the other. I follow the latter interpr., with the rāyáḥ phrase dependent on rā́dhas-. Although I have not found absolutely diagnostic passages, rā́dhas- is regularly modified by adjectives (like ‘bovine’) that specify the type of rā́dhas-, and mahó rāyáḥ may be a defining genitive of the same type.
