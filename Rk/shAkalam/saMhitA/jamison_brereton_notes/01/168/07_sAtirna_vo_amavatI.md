Ge’s n. 7 summarizes the gist of this verse, that what the Maruts bring is both disruptive and welcome. Their gift is rain (vṛṣṭí-, which never surfaces but accounts for the fem. adjectives throughout the verse), but it is accompanied by the violence of the storm. The positive/negative pairings are found in the first hemistich; the second one is only positive and ends by indirectly comparing the gift to the Maruts’ own consort Rodasī.

The curiously formed hapax fem. pípiṣvatī is best explained, with Old, as based on the perfect part. to √pi ‘swell’, pīpivā́ṃs-, fem. pipyúṣī, crossed with a - vant-stem to match ámavatī svàrvatī in pāda a. Despite the tricky morphological manipulation required, I prefer this to the easier derivation from √piṣ ‘crush’, assumed by Ge’s ‘zerschmetternd’ (with ?), fld. by WG., and Re’s ‘pulvérisant’. Gr (flg. BR) takes it as built to a desiderative to √pi, but there are no desiderative forms to this root, whereas the pf. part. is quite well attested, esp. in the fem.

The last pāda has formulaic echoes that identify the female referent in the simile as Rodasī. There are only two other occurrences of fem. asuryā̀-, one in VII.96.1 referring to Sarasvatī (wrongly classified by Gr with the neut. noun), one in the hymn immediately preceding this one, I.167.5, where it refers to Rodasī.

Similarly the bahuvrīhi pṛthujráyī ‘possessing broad expanse’ brings to mind another passage adduced by Ge, I.101.7 rudrébhir yóṣā tanute prth̥ ú jráyaḥ “Along with the Rudras [=Marut], the maiden [=Rodasī] stretches her broad expanse.” Although it might seem somewhat unflattering to attribute “broad expanse” to a lovely young maiden (esp. to us moderns; the ancients obviously had different canons of beauty), I think this is a buried pun. The two world halves (ródasī) do have this quality, and it has simply been transferred from that dual common noun to the fem. sg. rodasī.

jáñjatī has only one relative, jañjanābhávant- in VIII.43.8, where it modifies Agni and must mean something like ‘flickering’. On its formation see Hoffmann (IF 60, 1952 = Aufs. p. 40). Here ‘scintillating’ captures the feminine quality better.
