It is a physical oddity that the two Aśvins are apparently credited with plural mouths. There are two possible solutions: 1) The plural expression has been adopted from elsewhere. There is one other occurrence of madhupébhir āsábhiḥ (IV.45.3), unfortunately also in an Aśvins hymn; however, other examples of āsábhiḥ occur in plural context. 2) The mouths don’t belong exclusively to the Aśvins, but to other soma-drinking gods. The 33 gods who accompany the Aśvins here for drinking in the next verse might support this possibility.
