The āmreḍita idám-idam in pāda a must go with the clause in b. The ca that connects the two clauses is slightly displaced: we might expect it to occur after the first element of its clause, namely idám-idam. But the pāda boundary and the intrusion of a pāda-initial voc. dévāsaḥ have clearly interfered with the placement, and the sequence yám … yáṃ ca makes the syntax perspicuous.

The sequence of vocc. in cd is puzzling because the first is unaccented, while the rest are accented, including those that follow the first in the same pāda: tásmā agne váruṇa mítrā́ryaman, márutaḥ … We would, I think, expect either all accented (*ágne váruṇa mítrā́ryaman) or all unaccented (agne *varuṇa mitrāryaman). Old suggests that a new “Ansatz” begins after tásmā agne, and it is of course true that the caesura follows agne -- but also of course true that vocatives are not ordinarily accented in that position. He also points out that the three vocc. in the 2nd part of the pāda are the names of the three principal Ādityas, which occur together and as accented vocc. elsewhere (V.67.1, VIII.19.35). In the latter passage the three vocc.

are found pāda-internal post-caesura as here (see comm. ad loc.) Both of the factors adduced by Old no doubt contributed to the accentual behavior of this pāda, but it is a fine reminder that the rules of voc. accent, which we think of as fairly mechanical, are in part rhetorically driven.
