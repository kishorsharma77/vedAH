Contra the standard tr. and interpr., I take āha as 1st sg. This is the summary vs. of the hymn (with vs. 11 simply the Vāmadeva Indra refrain), and in such vss. the poet often speaks in his own person or that of the group, referring to the hymn that has just been recited. This vs. entirely fits that pattern. I also interpr. the enclitic te not only as a genitive with the deeds, but also as a dative with the part.

vidúṣe, identifying Indra as the knowing audience. (And who better than Indra to know his own deeds?) āvidvā́n is one of the few forms of √vid ‘know’ cmpded with the preverb ā́in the RV. It does not seem to have a clear nuance.

On svágūrta- see comm. ad VI.68.4.
