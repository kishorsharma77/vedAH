This vs. seems to posit a distinction between two somas: one, called sóma-, that is in containers and on the filter and another, called índu- ‘drop’, that embraces / surrounds (pári ṣasvaje) the first. What distinguishes them is difficult to discern; Ge suggests that the “nachrinnende” Soma is taken in by the pressed juice, but this doesn’t seem to make ritual sense, since the soma in the tubs and on the filter would already have been pressed as well.

Lü, predictably, thinks the heavenly soma incorporates the earthly soma. Say identifies índu- as the god Soma (somo devaḥ). Of the various possibilities, Sāy’s seems the most plausible -- that is, Soma the god encompasses all the forms that soma the substance takes in the course of ritual processing, though physically that substance is somewhat different at every stage. I also considered the possibility -- given the occasional identification and frequent juxtaposition of índu- and índra- -- that índu- here refers to Indra, and “embrace” is a metaphor for “drink, consume.” But I’d prefer to keep índu- separate from Indra.
