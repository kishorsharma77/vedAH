Ge takes rathyàm as an adj. modifying áśvam (Wagenross); Gr does as well, assigning the form to the vṛkī-inflected stem rathī́- (so also Lub). Neither of these interpr. is impossible; however, I prefer to take rathyàm as belonging to the marginal them. stem rathyà- (beside better attested ráthya-) and also to take it as a third term in the gifts we want from Indra. There is nothing riding on the choice of interpr., however.
