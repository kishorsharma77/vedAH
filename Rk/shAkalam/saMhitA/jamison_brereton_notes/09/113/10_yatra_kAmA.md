Re renders kā́mā nikāmāś ca as “les désirs (avoués) et les désirs-secrets”; although ni- might suggest something hidden or deposited in secret, but the related bahuvr. níkāma- (8x) seems just to mean ‘desirous’ without any special nuance.

The phrase bradhnásya viṣṭápam is found also in VIII.69.7, where I take it to refer to the surface of the soma (see comm. ad loc.), but bradhná- ‘coppery colored’ can also refer to the sun (see comm. ad VII.44.3, IX.97.52) and in fact to both simulataneously, with soma identified with the sun. What the phrase is trying to convey here is totally unclear to me.

As Old and Ge (n. 10c) point out (see also Doniger (134 and n. 5), svadhā́- and the root √tṛp ‘satisfy’ are associated with offerings to the Pitars (dead ancestors).
