Agni
Gaya Ātreya
7 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5
The poet has taken special pains to link one verse to the next. Verses 2–3 form a  single statement with two relative clauses joined by the marked conjunction utá.  Verses 3–4 both begin with the same words utá sma “And...again,” and verse 5 also  begins with a similar and conjunctive ádha sma “Then...again.” The final pāda  also begins with utá, but sounds almost like an afterthought. Its seeming superflu
ity calls attention to it as an addition and thereby also to the serial concatenation  across the hymn’s verses.
Less clear is the purpose that such concatenation serves. One possibility is that  this structure is a verbal icon of various kinds of ritual strings. Thus it might reflect  the poet’s request in the first verse that Agni “convey our oblations in proper order.”  That is, the connection of verses one to another might anticipate the connected  sequence of offerings made into the fire. Or it might reflect the convergences of sacri
fices, sacrificial rewards, and sacrificial participants at the rite, all mentioned in verse  2, or the union of Agni’s flames, amplified by the image of metals smelted together in  verse 5. Or it might even indicate the alliance between gods and humans signified by  the appearance of Agni as Mitra, the god of alliances, in verse 6. Or all of the above.
