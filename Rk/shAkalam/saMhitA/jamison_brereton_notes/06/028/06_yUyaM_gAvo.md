This vs., like 5c, has an echo from the 2nd Maṇḍala: the final pāda bṛhád vo váya ucyate sabhā́su “Your vigor is declared loftily in the assemblies” strikingly resembles the Gṛtsamāda Triṣṭubh refrain br̥hád vadema vidáthe suvī́rāḥ “May we speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes.” Both begin with adverbial bṛhát and contain a verb of speaking -- a passive in our case -- and a loc. of the place where the speech is spoken: vidáthe ‘at the ceremony of distribution’, sabhā́su ‘in assemblies’, with sabhā́- probably inhabiting a lower register, as might be appropriate for cows.

Kulikov (-ya-pres., 214) denies a passive value for ucyate here and tr. “Your energy sounds loudly in the assemblies” for reasons that don’t seem sufficient to me.
