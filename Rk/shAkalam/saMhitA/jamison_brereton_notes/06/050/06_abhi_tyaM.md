The publ. tr. omits the íd. I might emend it to “Just he will hear the call.” In cd I take ca as “inverse” ca (X ca … Y, rather than normal X … Y ca) connecting the two very similar participial phrases … úpa ca stávānaḥ, … úpa mahó gṛṇānáḥ# “being praised and being hymned.” Klein (DGRV I.122-23, 125, 173) by contrast takes it as conjoining the verbs of the two clauses, śrávat and rā́sat in the configuration #śrávat … úpa ca stávāno, rā́sat …), but placed after the preverb of the verbal lexeme in the 2nd clause (that is, by his interpr. úpa ... rā́sat). Since úpa never appears otherwise with √rā but is quite common with √stu, this interpr. seems unlikely. As noted above (ad 3c), I take maháḥ as the adverbially used -s-stem, against the standard view that it is a masc. acc. pl. (to the stem máh-) modifying vā́jān. The standard view is not impossible, but given the paired úpa … PART construction, word order favors taking maháḥ as part of the 2nd participle phrase.
