Indra  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
5 verses: br̥hatī  
The major trick of this short hymn is the extended pun between the words hári “gold-colored” (also used regularly for Indra’s “fallow bay” horses) and harya “enjoy,” a pun exploited elsewhere. (For a far more elaborate example, see X.96.)  For the purposes of this hymn, we have rendered the former as “golden,” even in  reference to the horses, and the latter as “gladden(ing),” in an attempt to sketch the  pun in English. In the last verse the poet slyly turns the golden mace of verse 4 into  silver, a move that would surely have caught the attention of the audience.
