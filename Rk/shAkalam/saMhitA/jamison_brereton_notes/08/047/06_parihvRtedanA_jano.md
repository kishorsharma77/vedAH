This verse is contrastively complementary to the preceding one. Both pári √vṛj and pári √hvṛ mean ‘swerve, turn aside, avoid’, but in vs. 5 pári … vṛṇajan is a beneficial action, whereas here parihvṛtā́(on accent see Old, Scar 708) refers to turning aside from the proper course, an action that causes a man to lose out on the Ādityas’ gift. How substantial this gift can be for someone whom the Ādityas favor is expressed in cd.
