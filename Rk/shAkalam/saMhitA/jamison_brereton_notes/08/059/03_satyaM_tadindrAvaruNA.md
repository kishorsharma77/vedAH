Most take yákṣ i yaḥ as a deriv. of √yakṣ ‘appear, display’, yákṣa- ‘apparition’, hence Ge’s ‘wunderbar’. I am taken instead by Old’s suggestion (considered also by Re) that it incorporates the si-impv. yakṣi ‘sacrifice!’ regularly addressed to Agni, and my tr. reflects this. At the very least it is likely to play on √yaj, given its proximity to yájiṣṭha- (1d, 3c) and yajñéṣu (2d).
