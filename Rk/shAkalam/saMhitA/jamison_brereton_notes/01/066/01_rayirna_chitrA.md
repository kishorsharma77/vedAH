The fem. gender of citrā́is a problem. The standard solution (see, e.g., Gr) is to assume that rayí-, which is normally masc., is occasionally fem. (so also, supposedly, in nearby I.68.7, though see disc. there). I find this unsatisfactory and explain the gender by assuming that citrā́modifies not only rayíḥ but also fem.

saṃdṛ́k and agrees with the latter.

Gr takes sū́raḥ as the nom. sg. of the thematic stem sū́ra-; in this he is apparently followed by Re: “(propre à la) vision (des hommes) comme le soleil.” I find this unlikely, since saṃdṛ́ś- regularly takes the gen., incl. sū́ryasya (II.33.1, X.37.6, X.59.5). I therefore take sū́raḥ as gen. of svàr-, with, apparently, Ge (/WG).

More problematic is ā́yur ná prāṇáḥ, where the first word should be the neut.

noun ā́yus- ‘lifetime’, since Gr’s supposed adjectival stem ā́yu- ‘beweglich’ does not exist (only the neut. noun ā́yu-, also ‘lifetime’). Thus, properly speaking, we should have an equational simile “breath like lifetime,” represented in Re’s “souffle-animé comme la vie (même)” and WG “der Atem gleichsam als Leben.” Nonetheless I consider the interpretation as an improper compound, as in Ge’s “wie der Lebenshauch,” to make more sense.
