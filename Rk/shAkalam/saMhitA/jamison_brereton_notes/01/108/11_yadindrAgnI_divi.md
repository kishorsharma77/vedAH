The locations in pāda a are appropriate to both gods, but those in b are distinctly odd, esp. for Indra. An almost identical pāda is found also in I.91.4, of the domains of soma, where all three terms are fitting, and in I.59.3 of the locations of goods over which Agni presides. A similar listing but without the mountains is found in III.22.2 of Agni (yád óṣadhīṣv apsv ā̀…), which again is apt for Agni. One has the feeling that the poet is trying to multiply the “wherever you are” verses and is not too scrupulous about his sources.
