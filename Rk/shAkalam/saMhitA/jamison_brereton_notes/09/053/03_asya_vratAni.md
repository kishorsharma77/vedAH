Because ‘commandments’ (vratá-) are especially associated with Varuṇa and Mitra, the beginning of this vs. might also direct the audience to the wrong referent for initial ásya. However, commandments are the property of a number of gods, and nothing else about the phraseology strongly suggests a referent other than Soma. In any case any doubt about the referent is settled by the beginning of b, pávamānasya.

Pāda c is constructed almost exactly like 1c, with a rel. clause serving as obj. of the main clause imperative, here rujá, without expressed antecedent in the main cl. In this case, however, the rel. clause is not nominal but has a full SOV structure: yás tvā pṛtanyáti.
