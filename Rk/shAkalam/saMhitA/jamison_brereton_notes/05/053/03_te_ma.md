The referent of té in the opening phrase té ma āhuḥ “They say to me” is not entirely clear. It is universally taken as the Maruts, and that is probably correct.

Among other things it is reminiscent of the Maruts’ proclamations “to me” in the previous hymn: 52.10 … máhyam … ohate and 52.16 … me … vócanta. However, it is possible that the subj. is instead unidentified human associates of the poet. This would avoid the awkwardness of having the Maruts refer to themselves in the 3rd ps.: “They say to me, ‘When you see them [expect “us”], praise.’” In pāda a note the figure āhur yá āyayúr. As Re points out, yá āyayuḥ … máde is the implicit answer to kathā́yayuḥ in 1b. The two instr. in b dyúbhir víbhiḥ have provoked more commentary than they probably deserve. Ge (fld by WG) takes the former as referring to daybreak and the birds are then the birds that start stirring at that time. This is not impossible, but dyúbhiḥ (incl. úpa dyúbhiḥ VIII.40.8) generally means ‘through the days, day after day’, and that is fine here. The Maruts would then fly “with the birds” because they come through the midspace, where birds are at home.
