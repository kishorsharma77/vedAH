The augmented impf. abhavaḥ is somewhat surprising in this context, because, at least in the publ. tr., it seems to refer to the recent past, rather than to the mythic past of the following (a)vṛṇoḥ. Perhaps, however, it opens the telling of the Vala myth continued in d (and possibly 24ab; see below).

The augment in (a)vṛṇoḥ is quite insecure: the Pp restores it, but it is not found in the Saṃhitā text and is metrically de trop.
