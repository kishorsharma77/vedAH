I take paḍbhíḥ in this vs. as belonging to a root noun páś-, meaning ‘with the eyes’, flg. Oldenberg (SBE [1897]) and Schindler (Wurzelnomen, 31). (However, Oldenberg silently retracted this view in his short piece on paḍbhíḥ some ten years later [ZDMG 63 (1909): 300-302 [=KlsSch 316-18].) As Schindler points out, other hapaxes occur in etymological figures like our paḍbhíḥ paśyeḥ. All other exx. of paḍbhíḥ belong to pád- ‘foot’, including the one two vss. later (IV.2.14). Although such close proximity of identical forms might appear to weigh against assigning them to two different stems, esp. since one of the stems would be a hapax, their contexts seem designed to disambiguate: vs. 12 contains the etym. fig., while 14 juxtaposes the word with another body part frequently paired with it: paḍbhír hástebhiḥ “with feet (and) hands.”
