The major puzzle in this verse is the grammatical identity of its first word, aṣṭā́. Ge takes as the agent noun to √aś ‘attain’, which is not otherwise attested (and for which we should expect full grade *naṣṭár-), while Old, Re, Scar (602), WG take it as ‘eight’ (which of course requires some clever manoeuvering with its head noun, dual hárī). I follow Sāy, Gr in taking it as the ppl. to √(n)aś.

On the sense of vātā́pya- see comm. ad IX.93.5. The scansion of this stem is unclear: HvN give it as vā̃tā́pyam, that is, presumably, vāatā́pyam, Arnold (p. 294) vaatā́pyam (with short first vowel), but Old vātaā́pyam. Ad IX.93.5 he also suggests vātā́piyam (which wouldn’t work here), pronouncing the scansion favored by HvN the least likely. Gr also goes for -piya-.
