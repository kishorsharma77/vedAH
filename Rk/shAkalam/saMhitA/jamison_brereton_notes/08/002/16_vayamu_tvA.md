This verse is a minor but neat example of syntactic modulation. The first pāda is in the 1st plural, the third in the 3rd plural, while the middle one is ambiguous: the plurals here can refer to vayám ‘we’ in pāda a or (coreferential with káṇvāḥ in c) serve as subject of the 3rd plural jarante. So pāda b, by being without inherent reference to grammatical person, allows "modulation" from 1st to 3rd person. I have taken pāda a as a nominal sentence, and b as having third person ref. and belonging with pāda c. But in fact the whole verse could be one sentence (as the tvā in pāda a suggests, since it should be the obj./goal of jarante in Wackernagel's Law position) with a harsh clash between vayám and jarante (which, notice, are the absolute first and last words of the verse, so we can go along as an audience on the happy assumption that the whole verse is in the 1st plural until the rude awakening of jarante).

The bahuvrīhi tadídartha- is a nice example of phrasal univerbation, from tád íd ártham “just this (is the) aim.”
