As Ge (etc.) point out, átūrtapanthāḥ is the clue to the identification of the referent of cd, since this epithet only occurs once elsewhere in the RV, in X.64.5, where it is explicitly used of Aryaman. In that passage he is also qualified as saptáhotā ‘having 7 Hotrars’, like páñcahotā here. And of course Aryaman makes sense in this highly Ādityan context. Nonetheless, I think pāda c (pṛ́ṣadyoniḥ páñcahotā) flirts with a different identification -- of Agni -- before sealing that of Aryaman by átūrtapanthāḥ in d. Agni could plausibly have a womb of dappled (ghee) (pṛ́ṣadyoni-), similar to ghṛtáyoni- ‘having a womb of ghee’ used of Agni in V.8.6, as Ge points out (n. 1cd), and of course Agni is both associated with Hotars and is the Hotar par excellence himself. Since, as noted above, Agni is not otherwise found in this hymn, the poet may have gestured towards him covertly in 1c.
