Pressing Stones  
Ūrdhvagrāvan Āṅgirasa  
4 verses: gāyatrī  
This third hymn to the pressing stones (the others being X.76 and X.94) has none  of the rhetorical ambition or vividness of the other two. It begins and ends (vss. 1,4) with an appeal to the god Savitar, literally “the Impeller,” to provide the impul sion to set the stones to pressing.
