I am puzzled by the reference here. The referent of cd, the one who makes sure Indra’s cup is full, should be the sacrificer, but the sacrificer should not be mounting Indra’s chariot. We might entertain the possibility that Indra is actually the referent (and is looking out for his own interests by making sure the cup is full), but, though switch between persons is very common in the RV, referring to the same referent in both 2nd and 3rd persons in the same clause does not happen, as far as I know - and there’s a voc. indra in the 3rd ps. yáḥ … cíketati clause.
