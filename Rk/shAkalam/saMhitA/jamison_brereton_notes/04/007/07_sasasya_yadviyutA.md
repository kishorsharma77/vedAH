This vs., particularly the first pāda, has been subjected to a variety of interpretations, which I will not pursue in detail here. The vs. is reminiscent of, though far less difficult than, IV.5.7, and in both cases I think it concerns the ritual and the layout of the ritual ground. The loc. phrase sasásya … víyutā “at the separation of the grain” I take as a reference to the spreading of the barhis, the ritual grass; it seems to correspond to the loc. phrase in IV.5.7c sasásya cárman “on the hide of the grain.” See also V.21.4, where Agni is urged to sit “on the womb of grain” (sasásya yónim). “At the same udder” (sásminn ū́dhan) is also found in nearby IV.10.8, also with apparent reference to the sacrifice or the ritual ground.
