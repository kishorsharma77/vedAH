By my interpr. rayíḥ here has the same metaphorical sense as rā́yaḥ in 3, namely manpower, or perhaps more narrowly the hero given by Agni in 4. Both Ge and Re take sahā́vā ‘victorious’ as an epithet of Agni, despite the hemistich boundary.

This is presumably because the adj. is felt to be more appropriate for an animate being than for wealth -- but this problem disappears if we take wealth figuratively for manpower. (They may also unconsciously take the 2nd position of yásya in c as an indication that the rel. cl. begins there, though of course they regularly interpret 2nd position relatives correctly.) The repeated adj. ávṛtaḥ is also better applied to an animate being (4x of Indra, once [oddly] of barhis), and it must belong to the rel. cl.
