The only problems in this vs. are found in pāda d: the accented verb mṛḷátā and the immediately following ca: the verb because there is no obvious reason for its accent, the ca because it’s not clear what it conjoins. To begin with the second, Klein (DGRV I.82), flg. Ge, takes ca as conjoining the impv. mṛḷátā with the pres. part.

daśasyántaḥ beginning c, assuming an implicit imperatival expression daśasyántaḥ

*sta “seid gefällig und erbarmet euch” / “(be) favoring and have mercy.” Re, by
contrast, seems to assume that the ca conjoins the last in the series of nom. pl., divyā́ḥ pā́rthivaso, gójātā ápyāḥ, judging by his “… et (vous enfin) nés des eaux,” though this would require an unprecedented displacement of ca to the right, with the verb inserted between the last nominal term and the ca. Between these two ad hoc solutions, the first seems distinctly better than the 2nd. To register it, I should perhaps emend the tr. to “(Be ones) showing favor … and be merciful,” despite the clunkiness.

The verbal accent is -- or may be -- less of a problem. If we do assume that the daśasyántaḥ stands for an imperatival clause, then mṛḷátā would begin a new clause. Although neither Ge nor Klein mentions the accent on the verb, it would be an argument in favor of their analysis. However, if we take the participle simply as the participle it appears to be, then it modifies the implicit subject of mṛḷátā and the verb should not be accented. There could be another way to get the accent in that case, though it seems artificial (or rather, even more artificial than the other suggestion). The sequence of four nom. pl. noted above is divided across two pādas, as shown by the comma in the quoted sequence. Only the first two have to be nominatives rather than vocatives: divyā́ḥ because of its non-initial accent, pā́rthivāsaḥ because it is accented in the middle of a pāda. The following two, the first two words of d, could be vocatives, accented because they are initial in the pāda.

They would then match the undoubted voc. devāḥ at the end of the same pāda. If gójātā ápyāḥ are vocatives, then the immediately following word mṛḷátā would need to be accented after these extra-sentential elements. However, this analysis requires the unappealing step of assuming an unsignaled change of case from nominative to vocative in the middle of an apparently unitary sequence.

After all this syntactic fuss, we may overlook the interesting question, who are the “cow-born” gods (who appear elsewhere, in similar sequence [VII.52.14, cf. also X.53.5]). Quite possibly the Maruts, an offhand suggestion of Re’s. Remember their cow-mother Pṛśni.
