There is some difference of opinion about the meaning of manótar-. Most take it as some version of ‘deviser, inventor’ (so Gr, Ge, HO [SBE], Re, WG), but Tichy (Nomen Agentis, 40 and passim) argues for the sense ‘reminder, rememberer’. I opt for something in the middle, ‘minder’. That is, I don’t think the term means that Agni creates ritual speech (the standard view), nor that he remembers or reminds the officiants of this speech (the Tichy view), but that he takes account of it, pays attention to it. The English term ‘minder’ (as in childminder) also has the connotation of taking care of someone or something, tending or ministering to it or them, and that sense would fit here as well. See also comm. ad IV.5.10 citing several passages containing the verb stem manu- that underlies this unusually formed agent noun with the sense ‘ponder, bring to mind’.
