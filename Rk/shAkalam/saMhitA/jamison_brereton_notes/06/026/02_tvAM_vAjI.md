The hapax vājineyáḥ is somewhat surprising, because the -eyá-suffix generally builds metronymics (AiG II.2.505-11), and so it should mean ‘son of a female prize-winner / of a prize-winning mare’ -- a feminine connection that would be particularly surprising if it’s meant as a reference to the Bharadvāja family.

Although I don’t have a good explanation, I do think the intrusion of this marked suffix, fairly rare in the RV, should be taken serious, and if vājineyá- is derived from the vājínī- (found in vājínī-vant- and vājínī-vasu-) (cf. AiG II.2.507 for this possibility), this provides another support for my contention that vājínī- has real fem.

reference, and its -ī- is not simply an Erweiterung (pace Debrunner, AiG II.2.409).

See disc. ad I.48.6.

Since pāda c lacks a main verb, it could belong either with ab or with d. Ge takes it with ab, seeming to refer to VI.46.1 as a parallel, and the publ. tr. follows suit.

On the basis of VI.25.6c with contrastive locatives of the stake, one of which is vṛtré (see comm. immed. above), I am now inclined to reassign it to d, with vṛtréṣu (c) and góṣu (d) the stakes. The revised tr. would be “… secured; to you … when obstacles (are at stake), to you when cows (are at stake) does the fistfighter look as he fights.”
