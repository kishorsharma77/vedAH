This vs. provides a transition between the praise-hymn proper and the dānastuti. On the one hand, it straightforwardly makes requests of Indra, as hymnfinal vss. tend to do, and it begins with evā́, a frequent introducer of the final summary vs., but it also turns its attention in cd to those who facilitate the sacrifice, i.e., the patrons. The participle dádataḥ ‘giving’ that characterizes them is telling. Ge suggests that the dānastuti begins with 7c and notes that like 7c the vss. of the dānastuti begin with utá.

The meter of the first hemistich is badly mangled. Old blames the poet “dessen Formgefühl unzweifelhaft schwach war.” But it may be a good strategy to mark the new section with a metrical jolt. Curiously the vs. is mostly free of the verbal knots that bedevil the earlier parts of the hymn.

Ge suggests plausibly that the “skin of the honey” is the skin on which the soma is prepared.
