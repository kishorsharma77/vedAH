Both Ge and Re explicitly identify the subj. of jujuṣuḥ in c as those seeking truth (voc. ṛtāyavaḥ), the human ritualists addressed in a. Although switch between 2nd and 3rd ps. even within a verse is not rare, I think the gods are the more likely subject, as they generally are to forms of √juṣ. This verse depicts the ritual model whereby Agni brings the gods to the ritual ground to receive oblations, with this location specified by námasas padé -- in contrast to vs. 6, where Agni conveys the oblations and praises to the gods (presumably in heaven), the other model of sacrificial interaction.
