This vs. expands on the etymological figure and superlative phrase in 16b, ugrā́ṇām … ójiṣṭhaḥ, but with three pairs of comparatives, beginning with the ugrébhyaḥ … ójīyān, lexically identical to the splv. phrase but morphologically different. The second is also an etym. figure, of less interest than the first because it lacks morphological variation: śū́rebhyaḥ … śū́rataraḥ. While the third substitutes a synonymic cmpd. for the abl. term: bhūridā́bhyaḥ … máṃhīyān “more generous than those who give much.” A low-key but pleasing set of variations on a phrasal theme.
