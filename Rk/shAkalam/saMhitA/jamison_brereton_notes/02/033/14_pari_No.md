As IH pointed out to me, gāt in b should have a modal reading, either as an injunc. matching the precative value of the preceding verb vṛjyāḥ or expressing the imperatival value often found in root aor. injunctives; hence either “should go around us” or “let it go around us.” The mid. impv. (áva …) tanuṣva suggests that it is Rudra’s own bows that should be un-strung. Recall that he bore the bow in 10a (bibharṣi … dhánva).
