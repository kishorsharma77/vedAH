I tr. dīdayat … ū́rmyā ā́“shine towards the nights,” rather than “illuminate the nights” with the standard tr., because I could not otherwise account for the ā́. Narten’s tr. (KlSch 370 n. 5) is similarly intransitive though with a temporal, rather than goal, acc.: “Er soll die Nächte hindurch leuchten.” Note mitrám √dhā in b reprising the same lexeme in 1c.

On dakṣā́yyaḥ, whose morphology resembles didhiṣā́yyaḥ in 1c, see comm. ad I.91.3. As noted there, in this passage it could also or alternatively mean “to be skillfully tended.”
