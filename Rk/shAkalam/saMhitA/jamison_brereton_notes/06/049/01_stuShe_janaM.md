Although non-formulaic groupings of gods are frequently encountered in All God hymns, the trio váruṇo mitró agníḥ is perhaps a little strange, since we expect this trio’s third member to be instead Aryaman. And indeed that sequence is quite common: there is a much-repeated dimeter pāda váruṇo mitró aryamā́(I.26.4, etc.; see repetitions listed in Lub), and the same sequence is regularly found at the end of a Jagatī pāda (I.40.5, V.46.5, VII.66.11, 12, etc.). I wonder if agníḥ is some sort of makeshift substitute for aryamā́in a Triṣṭubh cadence where aryamā́wouldn’t fit (cf. the same sequence in the acc. in the next hymn, VI.50.1, and it is found elsewhere in both nom. and acc., incl. the repeated pāda VI.51.10). After all, Agni is compatible with pretty much any Vedic god and could be slotted in when the more specialized divinity was metrically inconvenient.
