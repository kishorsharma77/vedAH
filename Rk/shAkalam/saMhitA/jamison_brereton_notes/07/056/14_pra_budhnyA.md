Ge suggests (n. 14a) that the budhnyā̀… máhāṃsi “deep-grounded powers” are the “verborgenen Herrlichkeiten” (niṇyā́) concealed in Pṛśni’s udder in vs. 4. Even leaving aside the fact that, as was discussed above, ū́dhaḥ in vs. 4 should not be a loc., this interpr. seems both unnec. and too specific, esp. since 10 vss.

intervene. budhnyà- here may refer to the powers that the Maruts, gods associated with the midspace, derive from the earth below, or it may simply mean something like ‘fundamental’, by a semantic development parallel to that of the Engl. word.

The preverb prá is showcased in the first hemistich: prá … īrate …, prá … prayajyavas tiradhvam. I am not certain what prá √tṝ nā́māni in b is meant to convey, but I interpr. it in the context of the importance of the Maruts’ individual identities (vss. 1-4) and of calling their names (10a) earlier in the hymn. Perhaps the Maruts need to “put their names forward” and make themselves individually known before they can enjoy the Gṛhamedha offering. 84 As noted in the publ. intro., the ritual references in pādas b-d are quite specific, alluding to the Maruts’ role in the Sākamedha, the last of the Cāturmāsyāni (“Four-monthly”) rituals. See the publ. intro. for further details.
