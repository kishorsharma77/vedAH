Ge takes vāvaśānáḥ in b to ‘desire’ (√vaś), but the same form in the same metrical position in 2b to ‘bellow’ (√vāś). Given the formal identity of the participles, I think they should be rendered in the same way (‘bellowing’; Ge’s n. 4b recognizes this alternative). But the proximity of uśatī́‘desiring, eager’ in our pāda c teases us with the other root, and it is quite possible that our form should be taken as a pun. For a similar conjunction see IX.95.3-4.

The hapax rathirāyátām (3rd sg. mid. impv., with Old, etc., not gen. pl. pres.

part., with Gr) is baroque in formation. It’s worth noting that 3 of the 11 forms of its presumed base rathirá- ‘charioteer, chariot rider’ are found in nearby IX.97 (vss. 37, 46, 48) with a further occurrence in IX.76.2.
