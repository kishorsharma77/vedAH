Ge and Re take ánu dhā́ma pū́rvam as referring to an earlier mode of praise (e.g., “nach der früheren Weise”), but dhā́man- in soma hymns tends, in my view, to refer to the physical domain(s) of the ritual ground, which Soma typically travels across in the course of his ritual preparation. See, e.g., the exx. in the immediately preceding hymn IX.96.18-19 and comm. thereon).
