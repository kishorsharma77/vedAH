Though this vs. is also found, better situated, in a Dawn hymn (VII.80.3) and is quite possibly extrahymnic here, the emphasis on the valuable goods, esp.

livestock, that the Dawns bring, to distribute as dakṣinā, well fits the hope for a good portion that characterizes the rest of the hymn. Note esp. that in 3cd we hope to be propagated with cows and horses (góbhir áśvaiḥ) and to become possessed of men (nṛvántaḥ), matched here by the entities by which the Dawns are accompanied: áśvāvatīr gómatīḥ … vīrávatīḥ.
