Soma Pavamāna  
Uśanas Kāvya  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn is structured by a series of similes; only the first verse lacks an explicit  simile. Many of the similes also involve identification of Soma with other divinities  (see esp. vss. 3–5, 7), and so the powers and mythological deeds of these gods are  implicitly attributed to Soma by way of these comparisons.  
The two outer verses (1, 8) are complementary to each other. The first is addressed  to Indra and announces the soma as distinctively his, while verse 8, emphasizing the  2nd-person pronoun as verse 1 did, declares that to Soma belong the distinctive  qualities and attainments of the Ādityas.
