On this vs., and esp. pāda b, see Old’s detailed and sensible disc.

The rare and curiously formed word bhuríj- (4x), without clear etymology, is always dual, and the gloss ‘arm’ (flg. Sāy’s bāhu-), or perhaps better ‘hand’, works reasonably well in the various contexts. In IV.2.14 it appears in a vs. with other body parts and in a context where artisans are at work; in VIII.4.16 a razor is being sharpened; in IX.71.5 it qualifies the fingers, which are assembling a chariot. Here the context is rather like IX.10.2, which has du. gábhastyoḥ, belonging to a stem unambiguously meaning ‘hand’. In this passage it’s important to note that bhurí(joḥ) is in the same metrical position as bhū́ri(-) in 3c and 5c and that bhuríjor dhiyā́is close to a phonological approximation of bhū́ridhāyasam (3c).

There is some difference of opinion on how to construe vivásvataḥ. Re supplies “(dans le domaine),” presumably on the basis of the fairly common phrase vivásvataḥ sádane. Old’s interpr (flg. Pischel), that it depends on dhiyā́, is the one I adopt: it has the merit of not requiring anything to be supplied, and vivásvataḥ depends on dhī́- in IX.99.2 vivásvato dhíyaḥ, where the thoughts themselves are impelling soma (hinvánti, like our ahyan). Ge’s interpr. is more complex: he takes dhiyā́independently with ahyan in pāda a (“Ihn haben sie … durch ihre Kunst zur Eile getrieben”), but with vivásvataḥ dependent on it with saṃvásānam in b (“der sich (in die Dichtung) des Vivasvant kleidet”), thus reading dhiyā́twice (see his n. 4b). I think this double reading is essentially correct -- though I see no reason to put the second “in die Dichtung” in parens, nor do I think that the dhiyā́ construed with ahyan in pāda a should lack the dependent genitive.

Though Gr classifies saṃvásāna- (2x) with √vas ‘dwell’, the later consensus (in addition to the usual, see Gotō, 1st Kl., 295 n. 698), patently correct in my view, is that it belongs with √vas ‘wear’, which has a well-attested med. root pres., whose med. participle is esp. common. On ‘hymns’ etc. as garments, see the passages cited by Old.
