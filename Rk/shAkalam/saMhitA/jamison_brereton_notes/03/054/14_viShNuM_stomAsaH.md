I am not entirely certain why “victorious Bhaga” is brought in here in a simile in this Viṣṇu vs. I suppose that our praises are making a triumphal procession to Viṣṇu, and the mention of Bhaga may suggest our hope that these praises will be met with a satisfactory portion of goods in return. See 21c below.

In cd it is tempting (see, e.g., Old) to make mardhanti the verb of the rel. cl.

beginning with yásya, which otherwise lacks a verb and appears truncated. But mardhanti is stubbornly unaccented. Construing yásya pūrvī́ḥ as a relativized expression of possession, we can assume that it asserts that Viṣṇu has a large female entourage; these females are further characterized in the independent clause in d as “generatrices” (jánitrīḥ), for which “mothers-to-be” seemed a more acceptable English rendering, who attend on him and do not neglect him. What this is all about escapes me, though Viṣṇu is associated with the wives of the gods in I.156.2.
