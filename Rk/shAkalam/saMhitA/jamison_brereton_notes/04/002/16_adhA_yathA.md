On ṛtám āśuṣānā́ḥ see comm. ad IV.1.13.

This vs. has double temporal reference, to the Aṅgirases of long ago using sacred speech to split the Vala cave and release the cows and to the current priests, who imitate the speech of the Aṅgirases in order to release the dawns from darkness.

The failure to realize the double reference to both the opening of Vala and the beginning of the current dawn sacrifice has caused interpretational difficulties. To begin with, śúci in c has been puzzled over. Old (SBE) attempted to make it a fem. adj. modifying dī́dhitim, but in the Noten opts rather for an adverbial neut.

Most other tr. interpr. it as an abstract ‘Klarheit’ vel sim. (Ge, Re, Scar [530], sim.

Schmidt [B+I 43-44]), while WG take it as the modifier of ṛtám in the preceding pāda. I do not know of other exx. of śúci- in abstract value; I interpr. it rather in conjunction with the phrase śúcy ū́dhaḥ … gávām “the gleaming/blazing udder of cows” in the preceding hymn (IV.1.19). As noted in the comm. there, I take this as a ref. to the Vala cave. But this “blazing (udder)” can also refer to the current sacrifice, with the newly kindled fire at its focus. The priests approach this with their sacred speech to set the ritual in motion and achieve dī́dhitim ‘visionary power’.

I think pāda c is appropriate for both the ancient Aṅgirases and the presentday ritualists, and so I would modify the publ. tr. somewhat. The verb ayan is a subjunctive to the root present of √i and therefore primarily applicable to the ritualists and the actions they will now perform. But I also think that it’s possible to interpr. it as a backformed injunctive to the same root present. Since augmented imperfects to stems beginning with a vowel always have lengthened augment (here, well-attested 3rd pl. āyan ‘they went’), it would be possible to form an injunctive by “subtracting” the augment a-, producing ayan, rather than the more proper yan (found only in III.4.5). By such an interpr. the Aṅgirases could also be subjects of the verb: they came (inj.) to the gleaming/blazingVala cave (represented by śúci), and the priests will come (subj.) to the gleaming/blazing place of sacrifice.

The Pp. reads kṣā́mā in d as kṣā́ma, and most interpr. (save for WG) follow the Pp. and take this form as a singular, tr. “splitting the earth” -- as a reference only to the Vala myth (even though it is not the earth that gets split in that myth). But I think we should take the Saṃhitā form seriously, as the elliptical dual it appears to be, extracted from the dual dvandva dyā́vā-kṣā́mā. The phrase “splitting (heaven and) earth” would refer to the visual experience of dawn, when the appearance of the dawn light at the horizon seems to split sky from earth, allowing the light to flood in through the resulting slit.
