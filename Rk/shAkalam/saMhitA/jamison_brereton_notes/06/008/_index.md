Agni Vaiśvānara This hymn, like the last, is dedicated to Agni Vaiśvānara and has a form of this epithet in every vs. but 5, always pāda-initial as in VI.7. However, the hymn is somewhat different from VI.7. In that hymn Agni Vaiśvānara was distinct from and dominated the sun (see esp. VI.7.5-6) until the last vs., while in this hymn the usual identification of Agni Vaiśvānara and the sun is in evidence. See esp. vs. 2. As noted in the publ. intro., the hymn is also heavy with initial v’s, esp. in the earlier parts of the hymn, which index the epithet. Note esp. the three hemistichs that begin with the preverb ví (2c, 3a, 3c), as well as 1ab … vṛ́ṣnaḥ … vocaṃ vidáthā …, 2ab … vyòmani, vratā́ni … vratapā́…, 3cd … avartayad, vaiśvānaró víśvam … vṛ́ṣṇyam.
