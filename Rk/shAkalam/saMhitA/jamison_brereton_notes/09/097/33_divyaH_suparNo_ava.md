The form cakṣi (also VII.3.6) is in both of its occurrences pretty clearly an impv., but its formation is something of a puzzle. It appears to be a -si impv. (so Baum, Imperative, 46, 107, with no disc.), but it has none of the standard supports for such a form. Not only does it not have an s-aor. subjunctive, but it has no aorist forms at all, and almost all the occurrences of its well-attested root pres. are medial.

And of course, assuming it belongs to √cakṣ, the form would have to be degeminated from *cakṣ-ṣi (though that would not be hard). The parallel passage IX.71.9 has a medial injunc. to the marginal thematic stem (see KH 122 n. 33): divyáḥ suparṇó 'va cakṣata kṣā́m. I have no explanation for this aberrant form; it is true that the proper med. impv. to the root pres. cakṣva (3x) would not fit this metrical slot, but that doesn’t seem reason enough to invent cakṣi.
