As indicated in the intro., I think vs. 6 simultaneously depicts the gods’ approach to the ritual ground and the Aṅgirases’ journey to the Vala cave. The rock (ádri-) to which they hasten is the pressing stone in the case of the gods and the Vala cave in the case of the Aṅgirases.

In pāda a I interpret yádi as yád *ī, parallel to yád īm in 7a and 7c and yád(#)ī in 8d. For this phenomenon, see my 2002 "RVic sīm and īm.” With Ge I take ádrim as the goal of saraṇyā́n rather than construing it with sádantaḥ, allowing the latter participle to be construed with the loc. góhe (a stem found only here, in the three vss.

6-8).

For dhiṣā́see comm. ad I.173.8 as well as I.3.2. The denom. dhiṣaṇyá- is found only here; I take it as ‘seeking a holy place’, derived from dhiṣáṇā ‘holy place’, on which see comm. ad I.3.2.

Note the phonetic echoes in dhiṣā́ya(di) dhiṣaṇyán(taḥ) (sar)aṇyā́n.

As indicated in the publ. intro. I take auśijá-, the vṛddhi deriv. of uśíj- ‘priest, fire priest’, as referring to the collectivity of these priests (see also V.41.5). It seems to be parallel to / contrastive with the vṛddhi deriv. in the next pāda, pāstyá-, found only here, ‘belonging to the dwelling place’. In my interpr. the duróṣāḥ hótā is Agni, and pāstyá- refers to the collectivity that he belongs to or represents, that of the household.

On the problematic duróṣāḥ (here apparently an -s-stem, as opposed to the thematic stem found in the two other occurrences), see comm. ad VIII.1.13.
