As on some other occasions the pāda-final vácaḥ, superficially a nom.-acc. (or a stem form), is to be construed as an instr. with the instr. adj. (divítmatā in this case), whatever the source of this truncated form. (See M. Hale [Fs. Melchert] for an attempt, unsuccessful in my view, to see it as an archaic zero-grade s-stem instr. [*- es-H, not the renewed and standard *-es-eH]. For further disc. see comm. ad VIII.39.2.) In this particular phrase, the existence of a fully instr. parallel in X.76.6 vā́cā divítā divítmatā strongly suggests that vácaḥ should indeed be construed with divítmatā here. On divítmant- itself, see comm. ad IV.31.11.
