Although, as just noted, there’s no unity in the tṛca, there is some continuity between tṛcas. Like the first vs. of the previous tṛca (25), this one has polarized nom. #imā́ḥ … gíraḥ# “these songs” framing the first hemistich, which responds to the acc. gíraḥ in the middle of the tṛca before that (23c). Moreover, the simile “like cows their calf” (28c) reprises “like mothers their calf” in 25c.
