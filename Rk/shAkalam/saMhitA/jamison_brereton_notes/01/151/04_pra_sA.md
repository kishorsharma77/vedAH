The voc. asura with short final probably stands for the expected dual asurā (so read in the Pp. and accepted by the standard tr. and AiG III.53), though it is barely possible that only Varuṇa (or Mitra) is addressed. The numerous duals (ṛ́tāvānau, ghoṣathaḥ, yuvám, yuñjāthe) make this unlikely.

I consider the dákṣam in c to be Mitra and Varuṇa’s (like the dákṣas- of vs. 3) and take divó bṛhatáḥ as an abl. of source: √yuj + abl. ‘yoke from’ is a fairly common idiom.

Re takes apáḥ in d as ‘labor’ (“l’oeuvre (sacrée)”), but the accent is of course wrong. Moreover, as indicated in comm. to vs. 1, the waters here make a pair with the cows of 5b, both as ritual substances.
