The Vala myth takes full hold in this vs. Instr. arkaíḥ is a pun, referring not only to the chants of the singers but also to the rays of the sun itself.

The 3rd pl. rurucur has trans./caus. sense here and generally in its other occurrences (see Kü 431), though not VIII.3.20. In several of those passages it’s in the cadence and would be better read *rūrucur (IV.7.1, X.122.5), and here and in the other case (VI.62.2, but not the trans./caus. opt. rurucyā́ḥ VI.35.4) a heavy initial syl.

is possible (though not metrically good in VI.62.2). The 3rd sg. act. pf. ruroca (1x: IV.5.15) and act. pf. part. (1x: I.149.3) are intransitive by contrast, as are the medial forms. The anomalous trans. rurucuḥ forms also have the ending characteristic of the perfect 3rd pl. act., not the -an expected for a redupl. aor. (e.g., (á)jījanan).

Nonetheless I am inclined to believe that these forms originally belonged to a proper redupl. aor. paradigm (á)rūruca-, found in árūrucat (3x), with the heavy redupl. proper to a redupl. aor., and that the 3rd pl. forms first adopted the -ur ending of the pf. and then, quite possibly redactionally, shortened the reduplicating vowel. It should be noted, however, that Old (ZDMG 60: 163) rejects this, an idea originating with Gaedicke.

Because rurucuḥ is unaccented, the first part of pāda b must be the main cl., with the following yád introducing a nominal cl. -- pace Ge, who simply declares it an unaccented subordinate cl. verb (n. 4b).

Note the periphrastic caus. vicákṣe … cakāra, on which see Zehnder (Periphras. Kausativ, passim, esp. 51). He suggests that it is parallel to the perfect rurucuḥ in b. If agreement in tense stem is really at issue, this would be another arg.

against my assumption that rurucuḥ is an old redupl. aor.

The opening of 4c andhā́támāṃsi is reminiscent of that of 1c tásmā íd ándhaḥ, though they have nothing in common lexically or thematically and they do not seem to demarcate a section. The repetition of ṛjīṣī́in the next vs. (end of pāda a), matching the end of 1a, suggests, however, that some demarcation is happening.
