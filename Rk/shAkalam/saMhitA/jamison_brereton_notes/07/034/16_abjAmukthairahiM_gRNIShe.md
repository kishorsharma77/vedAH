Assuming that it is the serpent that is sitting in the depths, that is, that the referent is Ahi Budhnya, who is found explicitly in vs. 17, I see no alternative to taking the nom. sg. pres. part. sī́dan as the predicate of a nominal sentence in cd, picking up the acc. obj. abjā́m …áhim in ab. Sāy. simply indicates that sī́dan is for acc. sī́dantam, and Ge and Re tr. cd as it if were a rel. cl. (e.g., “qui siège …”), a translational choice that blurs the Sanskrit. The alternative, which unifies the syntax at the expense of the sense, is to take sī́dan as implicitly modifying the 1st sg. subj. of gṛṇīṣe ‘I will sing’ in the first hemistich. So Scar (134): “… Den wassergeborenen Drachen preise ich …, {ihn}, der auf dem Grund der Flüsse weilt, wenn ich im Finstern sitze,” construing c (budhné nadī́nām) with the acc. serpent of ab and d (rájassu ṣī́dan) with the 1st sg. subj. This interpr. seems highly unlikely: why would the poet “I” be sitting in the darkness? and where does Scar get the “weilt” for the serpent? I do not understand the reason for the close sandhi of rájassu ṣī́dan.
