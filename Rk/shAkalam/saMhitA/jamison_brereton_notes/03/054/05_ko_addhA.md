The first pāda is also found in the famous cosmogonic (or anti-cosmogonic) hymn X.129, as 6a. The final pāda of that hymn, X.129.7d, ends with an incomplete sentence “or if he does not know …?” (yádi vā ná véda). Though all the standard tr.

of this vs. here find a way to incorporate our 5d into the syntax of the verse, I by contrast think the same trailing off into uncertainty is found here as in X.129.7. The lower seats of the gods in heaven can be seen, but not the ones in the higher realms.

We can only discover so much. As for grammar, I take the yā́of d as a neut. pl.

referring to sádāṃsi in c (so also Re, though with a slightly different interpr. of the rest). Ge (/WG) instead take it as a fem. nom. sg. referring to the pathyā̀in b, with c as parenthetical. I do not entirely understand the vratéṣu in d. The hidden commandments may be the laws that govern the further reaches of the cosmos.
