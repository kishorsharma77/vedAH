The phrase tṛtī́ye vidáthe “third rite of distribution” probably refers to the Third Pressing (though the two other occurrences of “three vidáthas”, at VI.51.2 and VII.66.10, do not seem to). Agni is of course present at all the pressings, but is not especially associated with the Third Pressing; however, tṛtī́ye sávane at III.28.5 is in an Agni context.
