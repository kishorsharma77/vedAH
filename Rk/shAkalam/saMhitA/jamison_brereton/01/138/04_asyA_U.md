Will you come near to us, for the winning of this (“team” of wealth), you  who have goats for horses, who are not wrathful but bestowing—you  who have goats for horses, (for the benefit) of those who seek fame?
We would turn you hither with praises that achieve their goal,
wondrous one,
for I do not disdain you, glowing Pūṣan, nor do I spurn your fellowship.
