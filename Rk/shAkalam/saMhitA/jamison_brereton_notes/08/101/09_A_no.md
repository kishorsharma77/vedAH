With Gr I take sumánmabhiḥ as a bahuvrīhi, contra Ge’s karmadhāraya “mit guten Gedanken” (though he allows the other alternative in n. 9b). This stem is attested in the nom. sg. masc. in VII.68.9 and therefore must be a bahuvrīhi, since mánman- is neut., and the parallel durmánas- (2x) is found only in the masc. and so must be a bahuvrīhi as well.

Against Ge, I take the second hemistich as referring to two different soma drinks, the one mixed with milk in c, the pure one in d. The offering of two types of soma is made clear in 10cd; note esp. the ‘both’ of c, ubháyasya naḥ piba “drink of both of ours,” which is immediately followed by the definitional d, śúciṃ [matching śukráḥ in our 9d] sómaṃ gávāśiram [matching śrīṇānáḥ in our 9c] “the pure soma (and) the one mixed with milk.” In 9c the present participle śrīṇānáḥ “is being mixed” (my italics) makes it clear that it is not yet ready to be offered, whereas the pure soma (in d) has just that moment been offered, as the passive aor. ayāmi indicates.

This reflects the ritual procedure whereby Vāyu is first offered pure soma.

Assuming that my separation of c and d is correct, this adds another ex. of a predicated non-past participle to the dossier.

Note the phonetic figure ayám … ayāmi.
