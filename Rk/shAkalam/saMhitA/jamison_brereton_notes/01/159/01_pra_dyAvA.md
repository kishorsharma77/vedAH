prá √bhūṣ is found only here (though cf. úpa-pra √bhūṣ in III.55.1 and ánu prá √bhūṣ in IX.29.1) and the meaning of √bhūṣ in all its manifestations is notoriously slippery. My tr. here is somewhat illegitimate: I generally tr. the lexemes in III.55.1 as ‘tend to’, ‘attend upon’; my ‘tender’ here (a verb that has nothing to do synchronically with ‘(at)tend’) is a pun on the English. Nonetheless, something like it seems called for here: busy oneself with something to present and bring it forward.
