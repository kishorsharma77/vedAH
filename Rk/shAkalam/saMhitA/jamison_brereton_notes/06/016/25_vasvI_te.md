Given the proximity of ū́rj- ‘(solid) nourishment’ beginning c, iṣayaté in b might better be rendered in a manner closer to íṣ- ‘refreshment’ in the same semantic domain. So Ge “für die speisewünschenden Sterblichen,” Re “pour le mortel cherchant la jouissance.” I might suggest an alternative “… for the mortal seeking refreshment, / o child of nourishment.” What gives me pause, however, is iṣáyantaḥ in vs. 27 in the same tṛca, where the ‘prosper’ sense is favored. Although our dat. part. has accent on the ending, whereas iṣáyantaḥ has (secondary) “causative” accent, in fact oblique forms of -áya-participles seem regularly to have desinential accent: cf. mahayaté (VII.32.9) to maháyati, kṛpayatáḥ (VIII.46.16) to kṛpáyati. See disc. in my 1983 -áya-book, p. 49 with n. 3. Therefore these two nearby forms are likely to belong to the same stem and invite the same tr.
