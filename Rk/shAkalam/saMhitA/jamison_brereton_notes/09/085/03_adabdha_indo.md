The blending of identities in 2cd is made explicit in pāda b here, where Soma is called “the very self of Indra” (ātméndrasya).

On the meaning of the secondary root √niṃs see comm. ad VIII.43.10. There I stated my preference for maintaining the older gloss ‘kiss’, against the colorless ‘seek out’, which was suggested by Gotō and adopted by EWA, etc. However, I must admit that, at least superficially, ‘seek out’ works better here than ‘kiss’ and it is reflected in the publ. tr. But a ceremonial kiss signaling fealty is certainly possible - like kissing the pope’s ring or the widespread custom of kissing someone’s feet as a gesture of respect. So Ober (I.531-32) “Sie küssen den [Fuss des] König[s] dieser Erde.” Both Ge and Re render the phrase without interposing a bodypart, e.g., “ils baisent le roi de ce monde.” I am now inclined towards the more precise and physical “they kiss the king,” rather than the publ. tr.’s “They seek out the king.” This interpr.

is made the more likely because “kissing” Soma in the ritual can well indicate consuming soma by mouth, that is, drinking it.
