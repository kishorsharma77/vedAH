As Ge points out (n. 8b), the role of Cumuri and Dhuni in the RV is to be put to sleep by Indra, so that Dabhīti can deliver the coup de grâce to them. See the various passages adduced by Ge and esp. nearby VI.26.6. In our vs. they are marooned at the end of the first hemistich, and after an initial verb in c another set of Indra’s victims is introduced: Pipru, Śambara, and Śuṣṇa. Ge asks whether we should assume an ellipsis with Cumuri/Dhuni phrase (in other words, supply a form of “put to sleep”) or a zeugma (in other words, to take them as objects of vṛṇák with the Pipru group, though their fates were met in different ways). I have chosen the 2nd option. The audience would certainly know the particular destiny of Cumuri and Dhuni but would also be able to lump them in with other targets of Indra, all as objects of a generically violent verb. (It may be worth noting that vṛnák here is one of the very few forms of √vṛj that lacks a preverb, though cf. nearby VI.26.3.) The segregation of Cumuri and Dhuni in pāda b, away from the verb and the other victims, might give us pause, but cf. vs. 5, where the obj. valám is found in the interior of pāda b, with the verb beginning c.

In d the datives cyautnā́ya and śayáthāya have parallel infinitival function.

For the latter cf. also śayáthe in the preceding hymn (VI.17.9, with disc. ad loc.) with the same apparent meaning but in a different case.
