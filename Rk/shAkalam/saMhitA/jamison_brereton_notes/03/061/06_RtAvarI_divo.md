The phrase arkaír abodhi has double sense, since arká- can mean both ‘chant’ and ‘ray’ and abodhi both ‘has (been) awakened’ and ‘has been perceived’.

The ambiguity nicely captures the ritual situation: we ritualists (wish to) believe that the natural world is set in motion and controlled by our ritual activity (in this case chanting that makes Dawn awaken and dawn), but the ritual is itself set in motion by phenomena in the natural world, in this case the appearance of the first light of dawn.
