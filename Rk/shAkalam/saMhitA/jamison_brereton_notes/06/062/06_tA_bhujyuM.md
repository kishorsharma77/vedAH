As noted ad vs. 3, I would prefer not to have the 3rd ps. prn. tā́serving as a subject of an indicative 2nd ps. verb (pf. ūhathuḥ), but the repetitive tā́pattern may have imposed it here.

The adj. areṇú- ‘dustless’ (8x) twice qualifies ‘paths’ (I.35.11, 163.6); the latter of these passages is in the instr. pl. as here. This suggests that yójanebhiḥ ‘treks’ is used here as a near synonym for ‘paths’.

Ge takes bhujántā to √bhuj ‘benefit, enjoy à utilize’ (benutzen), but better, with Gr, Re, Lub, to √bhuj ‘bend’. In any case this participle is clearly meant to echo the name Bhujyu.
