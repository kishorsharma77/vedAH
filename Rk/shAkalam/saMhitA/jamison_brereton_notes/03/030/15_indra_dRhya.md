The sense of the hapax yāmakośá- is unclear. Ge takes it as traveling trunks: “Die Reisetruhen sind bereit”; sim. Old. But the image of Indra standing by overseeing the loading of his luggage verges on the absurd. Old suggests rather that it is we who have come with empty suitcases, hoping Indra will fill them. Re takes yāma- to √yā ‘beseech’ rather than √yā ‘drive, travel’, yielding “les vases de la prière.” Since there is no comm. in EVP XVII, we will never know what he meant by that; it is certainly not transparent. My tr. “journey-bucket” is meant as a slangy term for chariot (‘bucket’ can be so used in English for an old or badly maintained car); certainly the use of kóśa- ‘bucket, cask’ to refer to (a part of) a chariot is clear from VIII.20.8, 22.9. WG’s “Wagenkörbe” is similar.

I also think that the chariots in question belong to the enemies mentioned in cd; this might account for the slangy designation of their vehicles -- rather like referring to a rival’s car as a jalopy. In any case it would seem odd to command Indra to stand fast and them immediately get on a chariot and go traveling.
