The rel. prn. yásya of the first hemistich serves as a modulation pivot from the 3rd ps. of vs. 6 to the direct 2nd ps. address to Indra of 7cd.

On udvāvṛṣāṇáḥ see comm. ad VIII.61.7, where I reject the Neisser / Gotō / Kü positing of a 2nd root √varṣ ‘sich ermannen’, etc. and assign it to √varṣ ‘rain’, with the specialized meaning ‘boil up and over’, as an expression of irrepressible energy. This image would work nicely here with the pen “overflowing with goods” (vásunā nyṛ̀ṣtam) in the preceding vs. (6d).
