Just as Agni was located in his realm, as the nearest one, in vs. 4, here the gods’ location is given before they are asked their questions. The poet now worries about what happens to his “truth” once it disappears from his sight and enters the realm of the gods -- is his “truth” theirs? Where did the offering he dispatched to them end up? Note the number discrepancy in triṣú … rocané. Though it is possible to separate the two words (so WG) “in the luminous realm, in the three (worlds),” this seems unnec., esp. in light of expressions like I.102.8 trī́ṇi rocanā́, V.69.1 trī́rocanā́.

Better to assume a truncated rocané(ṣu).
