khaja- lacks an etymology (see EWA s.v. khaja-kṛ́t-), but embedded in an epithet of Indra in martial contexts like this, ‘tumult’ serves as well as anything else.

The particle īm here lacks its usual accusative function (see Jamison 2002) and does not take its usual Wackernagel position; it therefore reminds us a bit of the similarly irrational áha vaí of the preceding verse. However, īm does serve to forestall a hiatus between janúṣā and áṣaḷḥaḥ and its position immediately after the former can be taken to signal that janúṣā áṣaḷḥaḥ are to be construed together. For another example of janúṣem see the next hymn (VII.21.1). 20 Note the sibiliant play beginning with samádvā and continuing through the end of the hemistich.
