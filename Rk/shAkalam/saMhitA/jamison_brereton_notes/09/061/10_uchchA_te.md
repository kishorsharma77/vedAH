The topic of the verse seems to be heavenly versus earthly soma. See Lü 204.

On jātám as an adj., rather than (with Ge, Re, Lü 204, Ober II.16) the noun ‘birth’, see comm. ad IX.55.2. Another arg. for taking it as adjectival here is that the same form is clearly an adj. in 13a. As in IX.55.2, I take the missing referent to be ‘honey’ (mádhu) on the basis of IX.18.2.

Pāda b contains several forms requiring disc., esp. what appears in the Saṃhitā text as bhū́my. This is analyzed, irregularly, by the Pp as bhū́miḥ. Gr gives the form as bhū́mī but identifies it as a nom. sg. to bhū́mi-. Old refers to the considerable lit. on the form, opting for a loc. interpr. (as do all the standard tr.). Wackernagel has a curiously split opinion: in AiG I.337 (1896) he identifies it as a loc., while in AiG III.136-37 (1930) he decides instead for the nom., though referring to his former opinion - and in the same vol. (III.155) he says the same form doesn’t have to be a loc. (“… muss nicht notwendig as Lok. bhū́mī gefasst werden”), but could alternatively be either a nom. bhū́mī or an instr. bhū́myā. The context, with the contrast diví ṣát “though being in heaven” with loc. diví, certainly favors a loc. interpr. for the form, even though taking ‘earth’ as the subject of the clause is possible: “earth took it, though it was in heaven.” In sum, I think the loc. interpr. is most likely, with an -ī (or -i) loc, to a fem. i-stem, like védī (or védi) in II.3.4 (see comm. ad loc.). A bhū́mi with short final vowel is metrically better here (as védi is in II.3.4), but it may result from shortening in hiatus.

The neut. part. sát has, in my opinion, the concessive value often found with the pres.

part. to √as, though most tr. don’t render it as such (and Re rejects this interpr.). It modifies the unexpressed mádhu in my view, but the neut. ándhas- acdg. to most others.

ā́dade is another ambig. form.: it can be either a 1st or a 3rd sg. mid. pf. (or a 1st sg.

mid. pres.). Gr takes it as a 1st sg. pf., as does Ge (“Den im Himmel befindlichen (Trank) nehme ich auf der Erde zu mich”), but a 3rd sg., with the soma (represented by mádhu or ándhaḥ) as subject (with Re, Lü, Ober) allows pāda c to serve as obj. of ā́dade - Ge has to take it as an independent nominal clause - and the Gr/Ge interpr. also introduces a 1st sg.

that has no other place in the context, where the 1st pl. reigns.
