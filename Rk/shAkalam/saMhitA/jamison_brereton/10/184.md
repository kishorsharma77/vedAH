Pregnancy/Birth Charm [To Assorted Divinities]
Tvaṣṭar Garbhakartar or Viṣṇu Prājāpatya
3 verses: anuṣṭubh
This little charm follows naturally on the immediately preceding hymn. There a  married couple prepares to have sex in order to conceive; here a range of gods and  goddesses responsible for conception and safe pregnancy are called upon to ensure  conception followed by a full-term birth.
## 1
Let Viṣṇu arrange the womb; let Tvaṣṭar carve the forms.
Let Prajāpati pour out (the semen); let the Placer place the embryo
in you.
1658 X.185–186
## 2
Place the embryo, Sinīvālī; place the embryo, Sarasvatī.
Let the Aśvins, the two lotus-garlanded gods, place the embryo for you. 3. The one that the Aśvins churned out of the two golden kindling sticks, that embryo of yours we call, to be born in the tenth month.
