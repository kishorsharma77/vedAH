Contra the Pp., Gr, and all standard tr., I read reṣaṇā́and take it as a cognate instr. with reṣáyanti, rather than reading reṣaṇā́ḥ and interpreting it as a nom. pl. The instr. possibility was suggested by Re in a note, though he follows the standard interpr. in his tr. There is no crucial difference between the two interpretations, however.
