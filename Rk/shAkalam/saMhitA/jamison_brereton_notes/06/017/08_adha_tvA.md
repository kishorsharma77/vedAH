As Ge points out, the non-god (ádeva-) is presumably Vṛtra. This identification is clinched by the fact that the verb here, aúhiṣṭa ‘vaunted himself’ (√uh/oh), reappears in the (pseudo-)participle óhasāna- modifying áhi- ‘serpent’ in the next vs. (9c).

In d the pres. vṛṇate is a bit surprising in this mythological narrative.
