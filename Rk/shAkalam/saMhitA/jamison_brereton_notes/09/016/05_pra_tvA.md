The vs. begins prá tvā, reminiscent of the hymn opening prá te (1a), and the audience would surely assume -- not least because 2nd ps. is generally restricted to Soma in the IXth Maṇḍala (see Re’s comm. here) -- that tvā refers to Soma. But this expectation is repaired (or dis-repaired) by the voc. índra that opens pāda b. See vs. 8 below.

I take the referent of gen. kāríṇaḥ in c to be Indra.
