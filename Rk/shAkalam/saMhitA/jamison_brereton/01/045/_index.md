Agni (except Gods 10cd)  
Praskaṇva Kāṇva  
10 verses: anuṣṭubh  
Like the immediately preceding hymn, this one celebrates Agni as the conveyor of  the gods appropriate to the early-morning sacrifice. Unlike the last hymn, however,  these gods are not individually enumerated; instead generic names for groups of  gods are given in the first half of the first verse, and in the last two verses (9–10)  they are summed up in the phrase “the divine folk.” The emphasis is rather on the  world of men. In verse 3 the poet mentions a number of prior singers as models  for his own interaction with Agni, and he groups himself with his kinsmen the  Priyamedhas (vs. 4) and Kaṇvas (vs. 5), as well as unnamed poets and invokers in  verses 6–8. Thus, while the two pairs of outer verses (1–2, 9–10) concern Agni’s  delivery of the gods to the sacrifice, the middle verses (3–8) are occupied with the  sacrificers’ desire for Agni to listen to their hymns and pleas.
