The stem suvṛktí- generally refers to a hymn and has in fact virtually been substantivized to mean hymn. However, it must be a bahuvrīhi in origin; I generally tr. ‘having a good twist’, referring to the clever adornments, the turns of phrase, of a skillfully crafted hymn. Here I think it has two senses: first, characterizing Agni himself as ‘having a good twist’, perhaps referring to his swirling smoke and flames, but then, as a sort of secondary or double bahuvrīhi, ‘having [/receiving] (hymns) with good twists’. In this meaning it is parallel to suprayásam ‘having [/receiving] pleasurable offerings’. Note that the two are both final in their pādas. I do not think Ge’s “euren Preis” or Re’s “hymne (incarné)” are either necessary or illuminating.

On the desiderative gerundive didhiṣā́yya- see comm. ad I.73.2. Although the tr. “desirable to install” is somewhat heavy, the complexity of the formation seems to require a weighty tr.

The last pāda indulges in play with the name Jātavedas: devá ā́deve jáne jātávedāḥ. The first and last elements, devá … vedāḥ, are virtual mirror images, with the 2nd word ā́deve reinforcing the first, and jáne making an etymological figure with jātá.
