This is the first time in the hymn that Soma appears in the 2nd ps.; the previous 2nd ps. address was to Indra (4d, 5d). It is also the first appearance of the 1st ps. ‘we’ of the human worshippers.

The nasal pres. dhūnoti is generally considered to express only the ‘shake’ meaning of the root complex √dhāv (∾ √dhavi ∾ √dhū), on which see comm. ad vs. 4 above, while dhā́vati is considered the only pres. to ‘rinse’. Therefore the pres.

part. ādhūnvaté should mean ‘shaker’ here. Gotō (187) seems to see in this passage a sort of play on words with -dhūta- in 4a, tr. “dem Preisenden und dem ‘Schüttelnden’ hilfreich seiend,” with ‘shaker’ in quotes. But I think the nasal pres. was available in a context like this to express the specialized ‘rinse’ sense; I find it difficult to believe that -dhūta- in 4a and ādhūnvaté here are meant to belong to different roots, esp.

since they both refer to humans’ ritual activity in preparing soma. Note that this is the only form of dhūnoti that appears with ā́, which is the standard preverb with dhā́vati ‘rinses’. The preverb here may be participating in a type of repair: the cmpd.

in 4a nṛ́-dūta- does not have the preverb, quite possibly because *nrā̀dhūta- by losing the syllabic quality of its 1st member would be hard to parse and lose the symmetry with nṛ́bāhubhyām in 5a. The nasal pres. may have been used here so the root syllables of the two forms could be matched (dhū) and also to avoid confusion with dhā́vati ‘runs, streams’, which is quite common in IX.
