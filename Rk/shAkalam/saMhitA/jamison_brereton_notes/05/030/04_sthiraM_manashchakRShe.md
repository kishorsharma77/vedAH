Ge (/WG) assume that c, like d, refers to the opening of the Vala cave. They therefore either take didyuto ví ‘flashed forth’ as a stand in for ‘broke/split apart’ (Ge, flg. Sāy.’s vyabhinaḥ) or disjoin didyutaḥ from ví and supply another verb with the preverb (or so I understand WG’s “… blitzend, zer(sprengt)”). But c and d do not have to refer to a single feat: a and b do not, and the recital of kṛtā́ni promised in 3ab covers a number of different deeds in the vss. to come. Moreover, though áśman- ‘stone’ can refer to the Vala cave, it has a number of other possible referents (see 8c where Namuci’s head is equated/compared with an áśman-), including Indra’s own weapon. Cf. IV.22.1 yó áśmānaṃ śávasā bíbhrad éti “who [=Indra] keeps bearing the stone with his power,” with the śávasā found also here. Since √dyut is very commonly found with ví (including the common and lexicalized root-noun cmpd.

vidyút- ‘lightning’) and since one of the sites to which a preverb in tmesis moves is directly after its verb (and here also adjoining a metrical boundary), it seems very likely that preverb and verb belong together -- and have their normal sense. In my interpr. this lexeme incorporates a simile: ‘cause to flash like lightning’ / ‘cause to lightning’ (unfortunately English does not have such a verb). In other words, with his power Indra can make even the dull and homely material stone flash like a lightning bolt.
