Mitra and Varuṇa
Yajata Ātreya
5 verses: gāyatrī
The poet is intent on praising the expanse of Mitra and Varuṇa’s power: he says  they are of “great dominion” (vs. 1) and are “proclaimed among the gods” (vs. 2).  Then combining their power among both gods and humans, he calls them masters  over “earthly and heavenly” wealth and possessing “dominion among the gods” (vs.  3). The climax and purpose of this praise of their power on earth and in heaven is finally expressed in the last verse: they are lords of rains, which come from heaven  to earth.
