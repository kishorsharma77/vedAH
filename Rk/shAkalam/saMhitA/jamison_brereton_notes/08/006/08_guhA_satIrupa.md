See comments on 7ab. The identification of the Kaṇvas and their dhītí is quite clear here.

Another example of anomalously positioned yád, like 2b and 3a. In fact this verse is structured entirely parallel to vs. 2: participial phrase in pāda a, prá yád opening b followed by an injunctive in -anta and a nom. pl. subj -i-stem, c nom. pl.

referrring to poets followed by r̥tásya INSTR. phrase.
