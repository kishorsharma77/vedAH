Indra The meter of vss. 1-6 of this hymn is analyzed by Arnold (p. 248, E73) as consisting of 6 pādas: 12 12 / 8 8 8 8, and this arrangement of the stanzas is followed by HvN. Old disputes this, suggesting instead 12 8 4 / 8 12 4 8. (On the lack of accent on śatakrato, which he takes as a separable 4-syll. sequence, see his remarks on II.22.3.) Among other things, this division allows sám apsujít to be an independent sequence, as it is in its occurrences in Uṣṇih, VIII.13.2 and IX.106.3. On this expression see comm. ad VIII.13.2.
