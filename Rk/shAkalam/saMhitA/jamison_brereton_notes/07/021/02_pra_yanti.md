it refers to some sort of negatively viewed plant (a parasitic plant, acdg. to Gr; see also EWA s.v.), neither of which is helpful here. I think it better to start with the root √vand ‘praise, extol’ and give it a negative twist appropriate to the context, hence my ‘sycophant’: praise gone wrong. A similar negative interpretation is needed for the usually positive term vedyā́- in the same phrase. Why vándanā is neuter and not masculine isn’t clear to me; perhaps a better tr. would be “sycophancy, sycophantic (words).” With sorcerers and flatterers in this first hemistich we then have two different ways in which rtḁ́ can be undermined within our own community, while the arí- ‘stranger’ whose ways are contrary to ours and the phallusworshippers in the second hemistich represent external threats to ṛtá-.

In c víṣuṇa- ordinarily means ‘variable, various’, which here shades into ‘variant’ and, with the negative reading prevailing in this verse, ‘contrary’.

The lexeme ápi √gā occurs in the RV only here, but ápi √gam can have a sexual sense (“inire feminam” as Gr chastely phrases it), and that image would be appropriate here, given the grammatical subject. 24
