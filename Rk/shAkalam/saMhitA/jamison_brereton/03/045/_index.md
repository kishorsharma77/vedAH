Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
5 verses: br̥hatī
The hymn begins by inviting Indra to “drive here,” as is familiar from the previous  “journey” hymns in this Indra cycle (e.g., III.41, 42, 43), but it soon turns to a series  of striking and elaborate similes and metaphorical identifications glorifying Indra  and his gifts. The middle verse (3) contains four separate similes and so, as often,  represents the concentrated essence of the hymn.
