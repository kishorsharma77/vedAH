Contra Ge (and Klein DGRV I.175), I take váktave with nidé, not with árāvṇe, which respects the pāda boundary and also conforms better to the semantic domain of the two nouns: níd- ‘scorn’ is verbal, whereas árāvan- is more general. In either interpretation the position of ca is a problem, since it appears with the first member of a conjoined NP, not the second. In my interpretation the configuration is X ca X' ... Y, in the Ge/Klein interpretation X ca Y...Y'.
