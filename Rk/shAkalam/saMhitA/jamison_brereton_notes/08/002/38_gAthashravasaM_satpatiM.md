The formation of the hapax purutmā́nam is not entirely clear. With Gr, AIG III.267 (and implicitly Ge), it presumably contains the truncated (ā)tmán- stem in one way or another, but I am dubious about the meaning generally assigned to it (Gr ‘lebenreich’, Ge ‘langlebig’), since tmán- almost always means ‘self’ not ‘life, lifebreath’, and puru- ‘much, many’ doesn’t seem the most likely way to characterize length of life anyway. I think it possible that it was influenced by expressions like purú tmánā (I.142.10) ‘abundant in itself’, though it is not a straight univerbation. It is also worth noting the long vowel in -tmā́nam, given that the only acc. sg. to tmánis short-vowel tmánam (I.63.8), though I don’t know what to make of this.
