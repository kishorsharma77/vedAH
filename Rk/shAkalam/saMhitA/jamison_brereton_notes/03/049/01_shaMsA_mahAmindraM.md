The first word śáṃsā is read śáṃsa by the Pp., i.e., as a 2nd sg. impv. This is quite possible, of course, and is the interpr. of Ge (/WG) and Old. With Re I take it as a 1st sg. subjunctive because this is more in keeping with the 1st ps. diction in annunciatory initial praise vss. like I.32.1 índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi prá vocam, but nothing depends on the analysis either way.
