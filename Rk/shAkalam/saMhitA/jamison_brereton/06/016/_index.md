Agni
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
48 verses: gāyatrī, except vardhamānā 1, 6, anuṣṭubh 27, 47–48, triṣṭubh 46, arranged  in trcas ̥
This lengthy hymn must, like the last one (VI.15), be dissolved into tr̥cas in order  to fit the numerical arrangement of the maṇḍala. As Proferes (2007: 9) points out,  this is an assemblage of Bharadvāja kindling verses, similar to the collections made  by the Vaiśvāmitras (III.27) and the Atris (V.28), likewise placed at or near the end  of their Agni cycle. Again, the content stays primarily focused on the ritual aspects  of Agni. Personal and family names are found fairly commonly (see especially the  second [vss. 4–6, and cf. vs. 19] and fifth [vss. 13–15] tr̥cas). There are overt signs of  unity within some of the tr̥cas: for instance, both the second (vss. 4–6) and the third  tr̥cas (vss. 7–9) begin each verse with a form of “you”; a variant of this is found in  the fifth tr̥ca (vss. 13–15).
