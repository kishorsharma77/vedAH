Rivers
Sindhukṣit Praiyamedha
9 verses: jagatī
This hymn celebrates the headlong glories of rivers, especially the Sindhu, here pre sented as the principal river into which all the others flow (see esp. vs. 4). As with the hymns to Sarasvatī (VI.61, VII.95–96), this one contains both naturalistic, if  hyperbolic, description of the river (vss. 3, 7) and depictions of her as a beauti ful woman and a prizewinning horse. Especially notable in the hymn is the litany  of river names in verses 5–6, which many scholars have mined for geographical  information.
