I see no reason to attenuate the identification of Indra with the adhvaráthat the grammar seems to demand, by a contrivance like Ge’s “den die Preislieder als (Gegenstand) des Gottesdienstes kennen.” See I.178.4, where Indra is identified with “the laud of the sacrificer” (yájamānasya śáṃsaḥ), and the immediately following verse (63.7d), where he is identified with peaceful dwelling (kṣáyaḥ).
