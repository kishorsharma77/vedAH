The syntactic structure of this verse is not clear, in great part because it contains no finite verbs, and most tr. leave the structure undefined. In my interpr. pāda a is a causal clause dependent on the main clause of pāda b, with yát … śávaḥ in the relative clause of pāda c coreferential with the váyaḥ of b. The point is that at the point of birth, in a stable situation (a), the Maruts had the strength to leave their mother’s womb on their own (nír √i is a lexeme specialized for birth contexts; cf., e.g., IV.18.2, V.78.9) (b), and that same strength remains with them (c).

I construe ánu with preceding sīm (“follows them”); cf. I.141.9.
