kṣapā́‘by night’ is somewhat surprising in the context of a soma sacrifice, since the beginning of the sacrifice is supposed to coincide with earliest morning.

Sāy. deals with this problem by advancing the time into morning, glossing ádha kṣapā́with rātreḥ … anantaraṃ prātaḥkāle “immediately following night at the time of early morning.” Ober (I.405 with n. 57) suggests that sacrificers fearing the lure to the gods of their rival sacrificers get a jump on them by preparing the soma at night, but given how regulated the ritual day is, at least in middle Vedic śrauta texts but also seemingly in the RV, this premature anticipatory step seems unlikely to be ritually sanctioned. As for the soma sacrifice that does take place at night, the Atirātra, it employs previously prepared soma. I wonder if kṣapā́should be taken not literally, but metaphorically. In the 2nd hemistich “the insightful thoughts of Vivasvant” (vivásvato dhíyaḥ) propel Soma on his ritual journey. Though Vivasvant seems to be the prototype Soma sacrificer (see IX.66.8 and Old on our passage), his name lit. means ‘having the shining forth’, and he is in some ways the image of the sun. See esp. IX.10.5, where Vivasvant is associated with the Dawns and the sun images produced by the soma poured across the filter. I suggest that here “the thoughts of Vivasvant” that give Soma a push represent the beginning of the verbal portion of the sacrifice as a metaphorical dawn, and therefore anything that happened prior to that in the ritual happened in the metaphorical night. For further on Vivasvant, see publ. intro. to I.139 and comm. ad X.14.5.

In c yádī (‘if’) should be read yád ī (‘when him’).
