The syntax of this verse is quite contorted.

The hapax sárī is problematic. Flg. Old, I think it must be interpr. in the context of the idiom vā́jam √sṛ ‘run for the prize’; cf. the root noun cmpd. vāja-sṛ́tand passages like I.62.16 sómo vā́jam ivāsarat. But what sort of form is sárī? Gr takes it as an -in- stem, which would be the simplest solution save for the accent, which should fall on the suffix (*sarī́). AiG II.2.328 explicitly rejects this analysis, suggesting instead (p. 407, flg. a brief mention by Old, in turn inspired by Ludwig) that, with following bhava, it is an early example of a cvi construction. But again, we should expect suffixal accent (see Whitney, Gr. §1093), and moreover the cvi construction is at best embryonic at this period (akhkhalīkṛ́tya VII.103.3 being the only likely example in the RV). Taking it as a rathī́-type masc. confronts the same issue with accent. Since an analysis as an -in-stem encounters only the accentual problem, not the chronological one of the cvi construction, and since -in-stems are considerably better attested than rathī́- masculines, an -in-stem analysis with unexplained accent retraction seems the best among the poor choices. As for my tr., since “be a runner after” seemed clumsy, I have substituted “be a contender.”
