Each pāda in this vs. contains a simile marked by ná comparing the Maruts to domestic animals (a, d), spirits (b), and children (c). Except in c, the simile begins the pāda. The vs. contains only one finite verb, śubháyanta, in b; the functional role of the finite verb is filled instead by the adjectives that are the point of 85 contact between the simile and the frame. In the publ. tr. I deliberately failed to render ab as the rel. cl. it technically is because the “which Maruts … they …” structure would have intruded upon the succession of similes.

In b opinion is divided on the sense of yakṣa-dṛ́ś-. Ge takes -dṛ́ś- as active, with the first member in an acc. relationship with it (“Geisterseher”), flg. Sāy. in his analysis of the syntax of the cmpd., though not of the meaning of the first member.

So also Re. However, Ge considers the possibility of a pass. sense in his n. (16b), and Old opts for the pass. interpr. For disc. of this cmpd. see Scar (232); of his choices I opt for the bahuvrīhi.

Another oblation to the Maruts at the Sākamedha, besides the Gṛhamedha mentioned above (vs. 14), is made to the krīḍin- (‘playful’) Maruts on the 2nd day of the sacrifice (see, e.g., ŚB II: 20 and Eggeling, SBE XII.408). The characterization of them in d as prakrīḷínaḥ obviously makes ref. to this oblation.
