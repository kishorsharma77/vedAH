I take the referent of ab to be Agni. Cf. III.3.5 táviṣībhir ā́vr̥tam ‘swathed with [=in] his powers”; given Agni’s ritual role it makes sense for him to be swathed in sacrifices. Making a god the referent avoids the role reversal Re notes in saparyántā, with (in his view) the gods serving humans rather than the usual situation -- though he then tr. śubhé cakrāte as reflexive or self-involved: “ils se sont fait (pour eux-mêmes une parure -- contrapartie de b),” rather than supplying a human object. But surely it is better (with Ge) to supply as obj. of śubhé cakrāte the being referred to in the relative clause of ab.
