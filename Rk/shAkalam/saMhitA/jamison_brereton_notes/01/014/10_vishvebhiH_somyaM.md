Instrumental plurals begin (víśvebhiḥ) and end (dhā́mabhiḥ) the verse. The question is whether they should be construed separately or together. Ge chooses the latter path: “Mit allen Verkörperungen des Mitra (der Freundschaft).” But because the hymn is dedicated to the Viśve Devas and there is an emphasis on them throughout (see esp. vss. 1, 9, with ‘gods’ or words referring to them collectively in vss. 2, 6, 7, 8), I prefer to supply ‘gods’ with víśvebhiḥ and take dhā́mabhiḥ separately (sim. Re, WG), interpreting mitrásya not as the god’s name (or not principally the god’s name) but as referring to the alliance that undergirds the sacrificial system.
