The hapax pratidhā́- is connected by Gr to √dhā ‘suck(le)’, presumably because of the soma-drinking context. But I take it rather to √dhā ‘place’ (so also Scar, though with different semantics). The lexeme práti √dhā means ‘set (an arrow on a bow), aim’, and from ‘aim’ to ‘shot’ seems an easy semantic path. Consider also English ‘shot’ for a quickly downed drink. That a bow and arrows figure in the Emuṣa myth (see vss. 6-7) may support this derivation.

The other hapax in this verse, kāṇukā́is not so easily handled. All tr. and comm. (including MM, EWA, s.v.) essentially give up. Gr calls it a “Beiwort zu sáras-” (the ponds in pāda b) and takes it as an acc. pl. neut., which seems reasonable, though it could also in principle be an old instr. sg. of an -a- or -ā-stem (as pratidhā́ is). Unlike some other passages containing opaque hapaxes, there is no phonological motivation visible. It resembles the hapax participle kaṇūkayánt- in X.132.7, but that is of no help because that form is even more puzzling than this one. It also resembles kāṇá- ‘one-eyed (RV X.155.1, AV+), and Edgerton (1911, The -k-suffixes of Indo- Iranian, 13) suggests it is derived from that word and means 'jug' — a jug “with a small opening and a large bulging body,” though he's not happy about the -u-. I have also considered the possibility that it’s derived from a MIA form of kárṇa ‘ear’ and also refers to a vessel for liquids, this time because of its earred handle(s). The Eng.

tr. ‘hogshead’ is an attempt to replicate the possible derivation of a word for liquid measure from a word for a part of the head. A hogshead contains a prodigious amount of liquid. One contributor to the word’s appearing here might be a pun on the vṛddhi derivative kāṇvá- ‘descendant of Kaṇva’, which is several times read as kāṇu vá- (VIII.2.40, 4.20); the Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn to Kurusuti Kāṇva.

So, something like “(the vessels) of soma provided by the Kāṇvas.”
