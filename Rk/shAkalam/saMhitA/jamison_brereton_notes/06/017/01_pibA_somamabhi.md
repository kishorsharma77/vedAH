Ge (flg Gr, fld. by Schmidt, B+I, 144) takes yám as obj. of abhí and referring to sómam in the opening impv. phrase (“Drink the soma, towards which …”). As Old points out (both ZDMG 55.319-20 and Noten), this entails either that the soma is within the cow enclosure or at least that breaking into the cow enclosure is a necessary auxiliary action for getting or preparing the soma -- which is, of course, not a standard part of the Vala myth. Old therefore emends the text, from yám to

*yáḥ, producing parallel rel. clauses concerning the Vala myth and the Vṛtra myth
respectively, with Indra the subject of both, represented by *yáḥ. But how would this corruption arise? Old suggests that *yáḥ (*yá in this sandhi context) was changed to yám because it immediately follows abhí, but it is hard to conceive of a Rigvedic poet who could be misled by a separable preverb, esp. since the 2nd hemistich has a supposedly parallel rel. cl. containing yáḥ, likewise following a preverb (ví). I agree with Old that Ge’s interpr. is unlikely, but I do not think this requires changing the text. Instead I think píbā sómam is an abrupt hortatory opening, essentially detached from the rest of the vs., and I take the yám as referring to the ūrváṃ gávyam. This whole clause anticipates the imperatival main clauses that end the next vss., 2d sá indra citrā́m̐abhí tṛndhi vā́jān and 3d … abhí gā́indra tṛndhi, both with abhí √tṛd and an obj. that refers to the contents of the cattle enclosure. My interpr. requires the rel. cl. of 1ab to float in syntactic suspension till it is resolved in 2d, with a number of other things going on in between -- mostly rel. clauses with Indra as subject, but I do not think this is much to ask of a Rigvedic audience. In fact, I think that the rel. cl. in 1ab is the initial marker of the ring structure that prevails in these three vss.

In d Ge suggests that vṛtrám is a “collective singular” and should be construed with neut. pl. víśvā amitríyā, tr. “alle feindseligen Vṛtra’s.” I see no advantage to ignoring the number, and the passages he adduces as parallel do not impose the notion of “collective singular.”
