Pāda a contains a textual problem: whether to read the transmitted vyódana (-e [so Pp.] or -aḥ, out of sandhi) ‘moistening/moistener’) or to emend to vy òdaná (i.e., -é) ‘rice-porridge’, the food associated with the Emuṣa myth that is treated virtually only in this part of VIII (the odanám in 69.14; 77.6, 10). See Ge and Old ad loc. I follow Ge in the emendation; it is very difficult to make sense of the ‘moisten’ interpretation, and the rarity of odanám might have lead it to be changed.

In the publ. tr. there should be an asterisk before “to the rice-porridge.”
