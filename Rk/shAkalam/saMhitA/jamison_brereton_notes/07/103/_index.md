Frogs 134 My interpr. of this hymn relies on the treatment of it in my 1993 article “Natural History Notes on the Rigvedic 'Frog' Hymn,” Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute 72-73 (1991-92 [1993]) [=Amṛtamahotsava Volume, for 75th anniversary of the BORI], pp. 137-44. Since this article is not universally accessible, I will reproduce much of the commentary here (without particular ref. to pg. nos. or to the sec. lit. that is excerpted there). The hymn is one of the most popular in the RV and has been constantly tr. -- e.g., besides the usual, Macdonell (VRS and Hymns …), Renou (Hymnes spéculatifs), Thieme (Gedichte), Maurer, Doniger.
