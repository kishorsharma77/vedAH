Battle Fury  
Manyu Tāpasa  
7 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, jagatī 4–7  
Like the last hymn, this one is a simple address to Manyu “Battle Fury” asking  for his aid in our battles, as well as in the division of the spoils. Rhetorically the  hymn is characterized by verbal chaining:  almost every verse ends with a word  picked up by the very beginning of the next verse. Thus, “fire” in 1d/2a, “alone”  3d/4a, “victory” 4d/5a, “ready to hand” 5d/6a, “pour in” 6d/7a; only 2d/3a lacks  this concatenation.
