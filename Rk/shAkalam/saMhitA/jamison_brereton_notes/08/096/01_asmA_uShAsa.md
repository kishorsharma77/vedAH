The relative phrase yā́ḥ … bhújaḥ “which delightful things” has no obvious correlative expression in the main clause of cd. Ge supplies “(mit denen),” which is certainly possible and perhaps the default option. But following a suggestion of Old’s, I take the asya of c, otherwise unaccounted for, as the functional correlative, despite the difference in number and gender. Because it is unaccented, asya should be pronominal and refer to something already present in the discourse, and there are few candidates, esp. because stotár- doesn’t seem to take a genitive. It would not be surprising to resume the fem. expression “delightful things” simply with “that (stuff).” The masc. singular referring to the goods Indra has acquired continues in vs. 2, with the yám … tám pair. I tr. asya “from that” rather than “of that,” since the latter doesn’t parse well in English.

In cd stotā́ram … yé ca … vṛktábarhiṣaḥ is a nice example of the “X and which Y” construction.
