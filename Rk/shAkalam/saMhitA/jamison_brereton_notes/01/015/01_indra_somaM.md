The accent on píba is syntactically unnecessary and not well explained.

Oldenberg (ZDMG 60) suggests either that it's a not explicitly marked foundation clause for the following clause, or that píba has a tendency to emphatic accentuation.

Although he does not want to get the accent from píbata ṛtúnā in the next verse, where the accent is correct (following voc. márutaḥ; cf. also píba ṛtúnā in 4c, again with correct accent), this seems a possibility. One might also note that in the second Ṛtugraha hymn sequence (II.37.1-3), the verb is accented in the phrase píba ṛtúbhiḥ, though again the accent is unnecessary. So perhaps píba ṛtúnā/ṛtúbhiḥ was a separable refrain-phrase in the Ṛtugraha ritual, and therefore received accent even when incorporated into a hymnal context. See now comm. ad III.32.1.
