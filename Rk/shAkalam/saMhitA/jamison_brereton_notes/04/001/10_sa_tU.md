In b I follow Hoffmann (Injunk., 175) in taking the rel. clause as devábhaktaṃ yád asya, rather than just yád asya with the standard tr. The sense doesn’t differ markedly.

More difficult is the configuration of cd. All the standard interpr. (incl.

Hoffmann), save for Old (both SBE and Noten), take final ukṣan as the voc. sg. of ukṣán- ‘ox’, referring to Agni. I prefer, with Old, to take ukṣan as a 3rd pl. injunc.

main-clause verb (√ukṣ ‘sprinkle’), with the subj. the immortals of c. The image is of the gods first creating the treasure and then bringing it to life like a watered plant. In favor of the majority interpr, I must concede, is the common idiom satyám √kṛ ‘make real’, which would in fact complement my interpr. of santi satyā́in 7a, but I find a voc. address to Agni in the middle of 3rd ps. reff. to him (10ab, 11, not to mention vss. 6-9) awkward. Re refers to “l’étrangeté d’un tel Voc.,” despite explicitly rejecting Old’s finite verb interpr. And what is the treasure? A slightly different phrase rátnam … dyúbhaktam (rather than devábhaktam as here) returns in vs. 18, where it seems to refer to the light of Dawn in the form of the cows released from the Vala cave; here I think it may be the light of the newly kindled ritual fire -- and of course the lights of Dawn and the fire of the dawn ritual can be superimposed upon and identified with each other. If the light of the new fire is the primary referent in this vs., ukṣan ‘sprinkled’ may refer to sprinkling ghee on the fire, which action would cause it to blaze up. The next vs. (11), which describes the birth of Agni, fits this interpr.
