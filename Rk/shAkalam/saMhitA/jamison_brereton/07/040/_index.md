All Gods
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The preoccupation of this hymn is the distribution of wealth, to be carried out in  orderly and fair fashion by a series of gods, starting in verse 1 with Savitar and  Bhaga (Fortune), whose involvement in the apportioning of treasures we met in  the nearby hymn VII.38. But a wide variety of gods are implicated in this giving,  as well as in providing other help (see vss. 3–4). There is little to attract particular  attention in this hymn, save for the sly admonition to Pūṣan not to be jealous of our  receiving gifts (vs. 6).
