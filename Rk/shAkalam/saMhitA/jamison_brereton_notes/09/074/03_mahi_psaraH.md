Pāda b is problematic, and it shares some of its difficulties with IX.69.3, which ends identically: áditer ṛtáṃ yaté. See comm. ad loc. In both cases the standard tr. (incl. my publ. tr.) take áditeḥ with what precedes, despite its being in the repeated phrase. The other problem is the referent of the dat. part. in the phrase ṛtáṃ yaté. Is it Soma, as Ge (and the publ. tr., also probably Maurer) take it, or the mortal worshiper (Re, flg. Lü; Doniger)? Determining this depends in part on deciding what “the wide pasture-land of Aditi” means. It is possible that it refers to the expanse on the ritual ground between the filter and the place where the soma meets the milk, in which case ṛtáṃ yaté could refer to the soma traversing this expanse, as in the publ.

tr. However, in the other two passages containing gávyūti- in IX (IX.78.5, 85.8), “wide pastureland” is the reward for mortals. See esp. IX.78.5 urvī́ṃ gávyūtim ábhayaṃ ca nas kṛdhi “make wide pasturage and fearlessness for us.” In the other passage, IX.85.8, the phrase occurs with śárma sapráthaḥ “extensive shelter/protection,” which is found exactly in our vs. 1d. I therefore now inclined to think that this pāda concerns the mortal worshiper - but this causes problems with the 2nd hemistich, which consists only of two rel. clauses, whose referent must be Soma. If ṛtáṃ yaté does not refer to Soma, there is no antecedent in the first hemistich (or in the following vs.) for the double yáḥ of c and d. Re gets out of this by supplying “(C’est le soma),” which does the trick but contravenes the apparent structure of the vs.; Doniger simply tr. part of d as a main cl. I find myself torn and take refuge, as often, in double reading - suggesting that at least one referent of ṛtáṃ yaté is Soma, and therefore there is at least a partial antecedent for the yáḥ-s of cd.

While fiddling with pāda b, I also wondered if we should take the pattern of repetition seriously and construe áditeḥ with what follows, rather than what precedes. Although urvī́- gávyūti- is found several times elsewhere - in addition to here and the two passages in IX just cited, also V.66.3, VII.77.4 - it is nowhere else associated with Aditi. And Aditi, as mother of Varuṇa among others, is associated with ṛtá-, so “for him who goes to the truth of Aditi” would not be a jarring expression, though its exact sense is hard to pin down. I therefore suggest an alt. tr.

“wide is the pasture-land for him who goes to the truth of Aditi.” See also IX.69.3.

As multiple comm. have remarked, Soma is both associated cosmically with rain and in the ritual preparation drips like rain from the press and off the filter.

All the standard tr. render itáūtíḥ with the older, now obsolete tr. ‘helping from here’ vel sim., rather than ‘eternal, ageless’, on which see comm. ad VIII.99.7 and EWA s.v. However, in this passage it certainly plays off itáḥ ‘from here’ in the previous pāda in the same metrical position; note the pattern c itá u(sr)í(yo) / d itáū(t)i(r), with the vowels ū̆ … i replicating the 2nd half of the word. This pattern is also anticipated by (gávy)ūtir in b (though in a different metrical slot).
