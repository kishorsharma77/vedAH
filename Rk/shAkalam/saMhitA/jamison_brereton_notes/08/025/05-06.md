The usual problem with (-)dānu-: ‘gift’ or ‘drop’ or both? In this case the first cmpd member sṛpra- ‘fatty, luscious’, the dwelling “in the house of refreshment” (in vs. 5), and the refreshments and rains (in vs. 6) favor ‘drop’, though both Ge and Re opt for ‘gift’ (Ge with an outdated rendering of sṛprá- as ‘ausgedehnt’).
