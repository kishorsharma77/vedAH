Pāda b is notable for its alliteration, making full use of all three sibilants: ṣaṣṭíḥ śatā́suṣupuḥ ṣáṭ sahásrā. The sums are tautological, as Old points out: sixty hundred and six thousand amounting to the same number. Both ‘sixty’ (ṣaṣṭíḥ) and ‘six’ (ṣáṭ) reappear in the next pāda. The standard interpr. is that these sixty-six in c are just an addition to the six thousand enumerated in the previous pāda. However, Old suggests that they constitute the opposite side, the ‘heroes’ (vīrā́saḥ) ‘seeking favor’ (duvoyú), who are fighting against those enumerated in pāda b. This interpr.

has the merit of not requiring those two words to be used ironically (on the latter, see Ge’s n. 14c), and it also makes the victory that much more impressive, that this small number, with Indra on their side, could defeat many multiples of themselves. The same point is made more forcefully in vs. 17. The same balance between the good guys and the bad guys, as it were, is found in the next vs., 15, where the Tṛtsus of ab are Indra’s allies, but their opposite numbers are found in cd.
