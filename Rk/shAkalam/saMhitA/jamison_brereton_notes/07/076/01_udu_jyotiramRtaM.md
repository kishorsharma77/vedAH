Unlike the previous hymn, which contains no other divinities, this vs. introduces two (though one without name) before mentioning Uṣas, who enters only as the very last word of the vs. The two other gods are Savitar (b) and Sūrya in his role as “eye of the gods” (devā́nām … cákṣuḥ, c).

The two virtually synonymous adj. viśvájanya- ‘belonging to all people’ and viśvā́nara- ‘belonging to all men’ are juxtaposed across the pāda boundary (a/b); they refer to two different entities: the immortal light (jyótir amṛ̥́tam), presumably the sun, and god Savitar (savitā́deváḥ). As such they may also subtly allude to the wellknown group, the All Gods, with their first member(s) viśvá- and the ‘men’ words implicitly summoning up the opposite, devá-. The pl. gods then show up in c, with another occurrence of víśva- in d.

In c it is not possible to determine whose krátu- is being referred to. Ge takes it as the gods’, and certainly the adjacency of the two words (krátvā devā́nām) is suggestive. Re seems to favor Uṣas. However, given that it is Savitar’s action in ab that raised the light, I think it likely that the krátu- is his.
