Present preeminent, lofty reverence to the two attentive ones; present  an oblation, a thought to the two compassionate ones—the sweetest  (oblation) to the two compassionate ones.
They are the two sovereign kings, whose potion is ghee, approached with  praise at every sacrifice.
And so the dominion of these two is not to be challenged from
anywhere—their divinity is never to be challenged.
