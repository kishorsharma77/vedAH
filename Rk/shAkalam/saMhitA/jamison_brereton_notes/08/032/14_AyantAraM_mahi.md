Ge takes máhi sthirám as the neut. obj. of āyantā́ram, supplying ‘bow’: “Der den grossen starken (Bogen) spannt.” There are several objections to this. First, it’s ā́√tan, not ā́√yam, that is the standard idiom for stretching or spanning the bow, including in the passages he cites as parallels. Moreover, suffix-accented -tár- stems (like ā́yantár- here) ordinarily govern the genitive not the accusative, and although this rule is often violated, the fact that niyantár- in the following verse (15), an agent noun to the same root, does take the genitive makes it less likely that this one would take an accusative. I therefore take sthirám as a modifier of Indra (as in the next hymn, VIII.33.9, and elsewhere) and máhi as adverbial. āyantár- here is best interpreted in the context of ā́yachantu in 23b below.
