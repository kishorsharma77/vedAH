gáldā- appears in the RV only here and its meaning and etymology are entirely unclear. See EWA s.v. as well as detailed discussion by Old. In his study of the word (AcOr 13 [1925], see ref. in EWA), Lüders suggests that it means ‘Strom, Gerausche’; although most do not accept Lüders’ interpretation, it makes contextual sense here, and a passage adduced by Old from MŚS I.7.2.18 ā mā viśantu indava ā galdā dhamanīnām, where it is parallel to indu ‘drop’ and is the galdā(ḥ) of pipes (dhamanīnām) also supports an interpretation in that general sphere. Note that the fact that the word begins and ends with plain voiced stops makes it phonotactically unlikely to be an inherited word, at least in the form we have it, and the -l- marks it as “popular.” The notion that “begging” by inferiors of superiors is a social requirement and also a potential source of annoyance to the superior is found elsewhere in Vedic. See Jamison 1996 (Narten Fs.): 191-99.
