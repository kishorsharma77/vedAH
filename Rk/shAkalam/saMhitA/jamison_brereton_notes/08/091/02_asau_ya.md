Narten (Yasna Haptaŋhaiti, 146 and n. 45) identifies vīraká- as a word belonging to women’s language (Frauensprache) and thinks it should be tr. “mein lieber Held” rather than “Männlein.” But I don't see why the diminutive of affection can't be an element here; Apālā is also trying to domesticate him and make him more approachable.

The substances Apālā offers to Indra to accompany the soma form a ritually defined group of offerings elsewhere (III.52.1), the Savanīya-puroḍāśa-. For disc. see Jamison 1991: 162-63, 172-73. Note that, judging from dhānā́vantam karambhínam / apūpávantam ukthínam “possessing grain, possessing gruel, possessing cakes, possessing hymns” with -vant- and -ín- suffixes respectively, it is difficult to maintain the often suggested semantic difference between -vant- and -ín-, with -ínmarking inherent possession and -vant- more contingent possession.
