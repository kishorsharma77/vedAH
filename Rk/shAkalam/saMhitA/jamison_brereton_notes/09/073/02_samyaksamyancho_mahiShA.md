As Ge (n. 2a) points out aheṣata can be either transitive (‘have propelled [soma]’) or intransitive/passive (‘have surged / been propelled’); both usages are paralleled in IX - see the passages cited by Ge. Moreover, as he also points out (and see again his cited passages), mahiṣá- ‘buffalo’ can refer either to soma or to the priests. Thus, to spell out the two senses: “the buffalos [=soma streams] have been propelled / the buffalos [=priests] have propelled (the soma).” The choice of both a noun subject and a verb form that allow double interpr. is unlikely to be accidental, esp. in this hymn of floating reference.

In b the subj. vená- can elsewhere refer either to soma (though usually in the sg.) or to priest-poets; see comm. ad VIII.100.5. The unexpressed element in the pāda is the obj. of avīvipan ‘have set atremble’. Both speech and soma (streams) are appropriate objects. If soma (streams) are the referent of the subject venā́ḥ, then speech is likely the object. Cf. IX.96.7 prā́vīvipad vācá ūrmíṃ ná síndhur, gíraḥ sómaḥ “Like a river its wave, self-purifying Soma has sent the wave of speech, the hymns, pulsing forth.” If the priests are the subject, then soma is most likely the obj.

Although there are no transitive forms of √vip that take soma as obj., note that in nearby IX.71.3 soma is the subj. of the intrans. vépate ‘he trembles’.

In the 2nd hemistich again the unexpressed subj. can be priest-poets or soma streams. Both can “give birth to chant” - the priest-poets directly, soma by inspiring ritual speech -- and both can strengthen Indra’s body.

As Ge (n. 2c) appositely points out, arká- can refer to the roar of the rushing soma, but it can of course also refer to the hymns of the poets. In c pāda-final íd seems relatively functionless: “just the chant / the chant alone” does not seem to add to the sense - unless it somehow underscores the double reading just suggested.

Perhaps it’s simply there to convert a putative Triṣṭubh cadence to a Jagatī.
