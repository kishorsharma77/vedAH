I take the first half-verse as a description of fire both sending its flames upwards and stretching out horizontally. Most tr. interpret yatate in b as transitive (e.g., Ge “er eifert beide Heeresreihen an”), but the medial forms of this pres. stem are intransitive or reflexive. I instead take ubhé sícau as an acc. of extent and assume that it refers to the seams between the two world-halves found in vss. 5-6. With these two halves, heaven and earth, meeting at the horizon, as it were, the seams between them would stretch horizontally.

The “new clothes” he leaves for his mothers in d are probably the ashes that fall on the kindling wood as he burns it.
