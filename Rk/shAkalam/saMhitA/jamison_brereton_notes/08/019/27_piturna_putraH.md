title = "27"

Ge and Re take this brief verse as a self-contained sentence, but this requires that masc. súbhṛtaḥ modify neut. havíḥ. Though the masc. can be explained as attraction to putráḥ in the simile, the sentence still doesn’t yield compelling sense.

In this vs., a brief pendant to the preceding pragātha, I prefer to take pāda a as completing, contrastively, the thought of 26cd. In the fantasy role reversal depicted in vss. 25-26, where “I” am the god and “my praiser” is Agni, my praiser would not be ill-established (dúrhitaḥ 26c), but well-kept (súbhṛtaḥ) in my house (27a). The two adjectives are complementary, and I therefore take the subject of 27a to be the praiser (not the oblation nor, as Ge also suggests [n. 27ab], Agni). (This is more or less Old’s view.) Pāda b is then an independent ritual instruction.
