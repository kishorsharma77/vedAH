Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
9 verses: gāyatrī
The theme of the hymn is Agni as the intermediary between gods and mortals. So  in verse 2, for example, he is a fire-priest like a human, but as a god he is immortal;  he is the messenger placed on earth with mortals for the delight of the gods. The  image of Agni as a chariot in verse 5 is unusual and striking, and because it is so  and because it is located in the hymn’s central verse, it dominates the hymn. It finds  echoes in the descriptions of Agni as the “conveyor” (vss. 2, 4), as “overpowering  all attacks” (vs. 6), and as piled high with “well-placed” ritual offerings and hymns  for the gods (vs. 8)—these are the likely “things” of Agni mentioned in the verse— and with “desirable things” for mortals (vs. 9). The image of the chariot is also484 III.12
reflected in the description of the sacrificer journeying to both “pleasing offerings”  and Agni’s “dwelling place” (vs. 7). Indeed, the vā́has, the sacrificer’s “vehicle” in  verse 7, is probably none other than Agni himself, who is described by the cognates  havya-váh and váhni.
