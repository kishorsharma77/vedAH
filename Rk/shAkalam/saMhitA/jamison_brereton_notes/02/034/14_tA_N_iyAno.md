The acc. participial phrases of ab must be construed with pári dīyanti “they fly around (him)” in d, even though the same referent is found in the dat. in náptre in c. The latter participates in a clever word play -- ā́po náptre -- which of course evokes apā́m nápāt even though ā́paḥ is nom. pl. fem. ‘waters’ and not part of a syntagm with náptre. The elision of the first part of his name may be meant: now that he is identified with Agni, he is no longer the child (only) of the waters. But as noted in the publ. intro., that the waters bring him ghee brings the watery and the fiery into harmony. Note that the waters as his cloak here (if I am correct in this interpr., see below) answers to the ghee-cloak in 4d. In the watery vs. 4 the presence of ghee was somewhat anomalous; similarly here in a mostly fiery environment the cloak of the waters stands out.

The phrase svayám átkaiḥ is also unclear, and indeed whether it is actually a phrase. Ge takes it as referring to Apām Napāt: “und sich selbst mit Gewändern (bekleidet).” He adduces IV.18.5 with svayáṃ átkaṃ vásāna(ḥ), but in fact the difference in case between the acc. there and the instr. here speaks against his interpr.

The simplex root pres. always takes the acc. of the garment, while the causative vāsáya- takes the instr. Moreover, as Lü points out (Varuṇa, 146-47 n. 8), the position of this phrase (far from the masc. acc. sg. in ab, adjacent to the fem. nom. pl.

in d) and the “harsh ellipsis” required makes this interpr. unlikely. Lü himself in his tr. (146) implies the waters are bringing the ghee with their cloaks, though in the n.

he sees them as “in Schmelzbutter gekleidet.” Acdg. to Re the waters fly around him “avec des vêtements (qu’elles se sont donnés) elles-mêmes,” an expression I don’t entirely understand. WG appear to separate svayám and átkaiḥ but, with Lü, Re, and me, also take the garments as belonging to the waters: “um ihn fliegen die jugendfrischen Wasser von sich selbst mit (ihren) Reisemänteln herum.” The further (and perhaps unjustified) step I take in my tr. is in interpreting svayám so closely with átkaiḥ, with the waters themselves becoming cloaks for him.

In b ‘paths’ is to be supplied with adhvasmábhiḥ ‘unbesmirched’ on the basis of II.34.5 adhvasmábhiḥ pathíbhiḥ in the adjacent hymn, at least by my interpr. The standard tr. (Ge [/WG, Re, also Lü, 146) supply ‘flames’ instead (though Re in his n.

suggests that “chemins” could be supplied). Where exactly he is located (“highest footprint” generally implies high heaven) and which pathways are meant are unclear to me.
