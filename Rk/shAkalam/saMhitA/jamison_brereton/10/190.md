Bhāvavr̥ttam (“Cosmogonic”)
Aghamarṣaṇa Mādhuchandasa
3 verses: anuṣṭubh
This hymn presents a cosmogony with tápas “ascetic heat, fervor” as the ultimate  origin of everything. The entities created and the order and source of their cre ation are curious and thought-provoking, but unlike the famous cosmogonic hymn  X.129, there are no puzzles to decode.
## 1
Both truth and reality were born from heat when it was kindled.
From that, night was born, and from that the undulating sea.
## 2
From the undulating sea was born the year,
which distributes the days and nights and exerts its will over everyone  who blinks [=mortals].
## 3
The Ordainer arranged, according to their proper order, sun and moon, heaven and earth, midspace and sunlight.
