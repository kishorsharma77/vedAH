Soma Pavamāna
Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: gāyatrī
Each verse of this hymn contains a form (two in vs. 3)  of the root pū “purify,”  all verbs except for the “filter” word (pavítram) in verse 4; the three middle verses  (3–5) also all contain the instrumental dhā́rayā “in a stream.” The hymn thus has  a tight lexical structure, and the content is similarly limited, to wishes for rain as  refreshment and nourishment (vss. 1, 3–4) and for increase in cattle (vs. 3). The first  four verses contain imperatives addressed to Soma, the last verse a 3rd-person past  tense, suggesting that the wishes expressed have been fulfilled.
## 1
Purify yourself, bringing rain to us, a wave of waters from heaven,
lofty refreshments free from disease.
## 2
Purify yourself in that stream by which the people’s cows
will come here, right up to our house.
## 3
Purify yourself in a stream as ghee, you who best pursue the gods at the  sacrifices;
for us bring rain through purification.
## 4
For our nourishment run through the fleecy filter in a stream,
for the gods will surely listen!
## 5
Purifying himself, he has flowed, constantly smashing away demons, making the lights light up as of old.
