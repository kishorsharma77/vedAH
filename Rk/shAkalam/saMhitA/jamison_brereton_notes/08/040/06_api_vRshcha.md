Both vratáti- and guṣpitá- are found in the RV only here, but are attested later -- the latter already AV.

The meter of de is faulty, with two extra syllables. Which pāda is hypermetric depends on which one vásu is assigned to: Old (Prol.) and Lub put it final in d, HvN initial in e. In favor of the former is vásu’s general preference for pāda-final position and, in particular, the final of 4e, with a form of √bhṛ + vásu (bibhṛtó vásu). Old (Noten) explicitly counsels against omitting it as others have suggested. It would be possible to eliminate another disyllable, e.g., pleonastic vayám, but there is no strong reason to.
