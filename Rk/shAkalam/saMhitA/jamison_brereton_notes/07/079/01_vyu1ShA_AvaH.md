This vs. echoes the 1st vs. of VII.75 in several ways, and VII.75.1 is helpful in resolving the verbal ambiguities in this one. Our vs. contains two occurrences (pādas a, d) of ví … āvaḥ in exactly that sandhi form. The 3rd sg. augmented root aor.

form āvaḥ is entirely ambiguous between √vas ‘dawn’ and √vṛ ‘obstruct, cover’, and the preverb ví does not help, since ví √vas regularly means ‘dawn widely’ and ví √vṛ ‘uncover, open’. VII.75.1 also contains two such forms, but both of them are in sandhi forms that allow their root affiliation to be unambiguously identified. VII.75.1 opens exactly like our vs., vy ùṣā́āvaḥ, but in VII.75 the sandhi form of the verb is āvo, which must belong to √vas. Pāda c of VII.75.1 contains āvar (though in tmesis with ápa rather than ví); again, the sandhi form -ar makes it clear that this verb must belong to √vṛ. Given the parallelism of the two vss., it seems almost as if VII.75.1 is providing a guide to the ambiguities of our vs. In any case the standard interpr. all distribute the āvaḥ forms in this vs. as just laid out.

There is another echo between the two vss.: pāda a here contains pathyā̀, which could represent either instr. sg. pathyā̀(so Pp.) or acc. pl. pathyā̀ḥ out of sandhi, recalling pathyā̀in VII.75.1d, which must represent acc. pl. -āḥ before a vowel. In this passage I favor the instr. sg. Note also that páñca ksitī́ḥ opening our b pāda opens VII.75.4b.
