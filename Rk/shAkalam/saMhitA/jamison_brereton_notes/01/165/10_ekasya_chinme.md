In most tr. the rel. cl. of pāda b seems loosely construed with the main clause of pāda a, with the yā́referring to an unexpressed acc. of respect in the main cl.: “Let my force be far-reaching with regard to (those things), which I will do …” However, the vertical parallelism of 9d, 10b, and 10d suggests a different syntactic arrangement 9d yā́ni [kari]ṣyā́kṛṇuhí … 10b yā́nú [dadhṛ]ṣvā́n kṛṇávai … 10d yā́ni Not only do these pādas match phonologically as in the display above, but 9d and 10d show the same syntactic structure: a preposed rel. cl. introduced by an acc. pl.

referring to deeds and a verb governing it referring to the doing of the deeds (yā́ni

*kariṣyāḥ; yā́ni cyavam), followed by a main clause where the doer of the rel. clause
is also subject: kṛṇuhí, īśē. I suggest 10b should be interpr. in the same general pattern. Indra says “Which (deeds) (I am) bold (to do), I will do.” In other words, pāda b contains two clauses, not one, and is independent of the preceding pāda.

The 1st sg. cyavam is the only non-causative active form to this root.

Hoffmann (Injunk. 247-48) takes it as a subjunctive, an ersatz for the unenlarged 1st sg. subj. ending -ā. I agree that the form has been tampered with, but would suggest that what really underlies the form may be medial subjunctive 1st sg. *cyavai, which should have yielded *cyavā in this sandhi position. The -m serves as a pleonastic hiatus filler (perhaps originally -m̐). An alternative that would work better phonologically is to assume a 1st sg. indicative *cyave, not a subjunctive. This would yield *cyava in sandhi, to which the -m could be added without adjusting the vowel length. Since the verb in the main cl., īśe, is likewise present indicative (as opposed to impv. kṛṇuhí in 9d and subjunctive kṛṇávai in 10b), an indicative in the subord. cl.

would match.
