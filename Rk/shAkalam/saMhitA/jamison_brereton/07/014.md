Agni
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: br̥hatī 1, triṣṭubh 2, 3
This hymn marks the raising of the sacrificial fire by placing kindling, by pouring  ghee, and by reciting praises and invocations, which verbal products, as much as  the wood and ghee, bring the fire to life. Noteworthy in this hymn is the repetition  of an emphatic vayám “we” at the beginning of each pāda in verse 2, continuing its  placement in 1d. The poet is drawing the god’s attention not only to the forms of  ritual service he is being offered, but also to the poet and his people as those offer
ing that service.
## 1
To Jātavedas with our kindling wood, to the god with our invocations to  the gods,
to him of bright flame with our oblations—to Agni we would offer
service with reverence.
## 2
We would honor you with our kindling wood, o Agni; we would offer  service with our good praise, o you worthy of the sacrifice—
we with ghee, o Hotar of the rite, and we with our oblation, o god of  noble flame.
## 3
Travel here with the gods to our invocation to the gods, taking pleasure  in our vaṣaṭ-call, o Agni.
We would be those offering service to you, a god. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.
