With most interpr., I take unaccented iṣṭe at the end of c, also found at the end of its pāda in VI.8.7, as a voc. to a -ti-stem, built to √iṣ ‘seek’. Although such a form and usage is unusual, Ge’s suggestion, that it is truncated from *iṣtébhiḥ (Ge ‘lieben’), seems less likely. See Old’s scathing criticism of the same emendation ad VI.8.7 in ZDMG 55.296 (=KlSch. 755).
