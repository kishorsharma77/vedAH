Ge and Re in their different ways attempt to wring a more palatable tr.

from yajante than the VP should allow. The problem is that the acc. with this verb here is not a god, the usual object, but two desirable qualities of a god, namely fellowship/companionship and vitality/vigor. In Ge’s rendering the reverent ones “request” these qualities (erbitten); in Re’s they “obtain them by sacrifice.” But though Re claims that this is the meaning of medial forms of √yaj, in fact uncompounded middles take the god sacrificed to, just like active forms; cf. nearby 54
