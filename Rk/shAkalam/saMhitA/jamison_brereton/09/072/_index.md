Soma Pavamāna  
Harimanta Āṅgirasa  
9 verses: jagatī  
The role of humans in both the physical and the verbal preparation of Soma is  emphasized in this hymn. The first verse sets this tone, with the anonymous priestly subjects of “they groom” of pāda a and the anonymous praisers who impel the  soma in the second half, a division of labor found as well in verse 2; see also verses  4–6, 8. The exact responsion of the last parts of 4d and 5b seem to mark an ompha los, but there is little other evidence for such a structure.  
The hymn contains one major problem: the hapax vinaṃgr̥sá in 3c. The phrase ology in this pāda is strongly suggestive of erotic slang, but unfortunately the word  has so far defeated all attempts to decode it. It is worth noting, however, that it is a  partial anagram of the patronymic of the poet Harimanta Āṅgirasa, and he may be  punning on his name in this playful, erotic context.
