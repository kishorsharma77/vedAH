Maruts  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
12 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5, 12  
A typical Marut hymn: their beauty and their adornments, their unruly journey to  the sacrifice and the thunderstorm it represents, their parentage (Rudra as father, Pr̥śni the cow as mother), their fearsome power. One stylistic peculiarity is the ten dency to repeat with minimal variation parts of one verse in the next, an example  of concatenative repetition; see 2c/3ab; 4cd/5a; 6c/7b, d; 10a/11a.  
Although the focus throughout is firmly on the Maruts, there is one seemingly  intrusive verse (9), where the Maruts are unmentioned and mythologically irrel evant, in which Tvaṣṭar fashions the mace for Indra to slay Vr̥tra. Indra’s release of  the waters after the slaying must be the point of contact, since the next two verses  (10–11) concern the Maruts’ tipping the heavenly well to pour out its water.
