The list of priests contains the hapax ā́vayā(ḥ), whose derivation and meaning are unclear. For suggestions and disc. see, e.g., Old, Ge, Re. I tentatively favor a connection with áva √yā ‘propitiate, expiate’, but the form presents grave difficulties for that analysis. For one thing, we should expect a root-noun cmpd.

(*)avayā́- with short initial vowel and accent on the root -- and in fact we get just that form in I.173.12. See detailed disc. by Scar (404-7, with our form treated in n. 565).

However, it can be pointed out that this lexeme is mutilated elsewhere -- e.g., in nearby I.165.15 (but Agastya, not Dīrghatamas), where vayā́m is better read ‘vayā́m (i.e., avayā́m), which sandhi form its position after tanvè would allow. Thus, the connection with áva √yā reflected in the publ. tr. is quite insecure, and it may be best to follow Old in accepting the traditional analysis as ā́-vayas-, rendering it ‘whose life force is (right) here’. This avoids the formal difficulties, but I don’t see what kind of priest this would be.

There is a mild disconnect between the two hemistichs: the first half is a list entirely in the nominative, but the second contains a 2nd pl. impv. ā́pṛṇadhvam, whose 2nd ps. subjects should be the nominatives of ab.
