Soma Pavamāna
Bindu Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
The first verse of this hymn is very like the opening verse of IX.29, and it is con structed of the usual building blocks of soma hymns, particularly those in gāyatrī meter. It clusters especially closely with the three hymns that precede it: these four  hymns (IX.27–30) are all attributed to poets with the patronymic Āṅgirasa, and all  four contain at least one form of śúṣma “tempestuous force” or śuṣmín “tempestu ous” (IX.27.6; 28.6; 29.6; 30.1, 3), mostly in the final verse. This word thus seems  to be the signature of this little group of poets. (The word does not pattern closely  with other Āṅgirasa poets, even in the IXth Maṇḍala.)
