The first hemistich mixes the visual and the audible in a species of synaesthesia, esp. clear in the description of Agni as “brightening thunder,” but note also his “ever-roaring” flames.

The standard tr. construe purū́ṇi pṛthū́ni with bhárvan; e.g., Ge “die vielen, breiten (Flächen) fressend.” But nearby VI.12.5 anuyā́ti pṛthvī́m favors taking the acc. as an acc. of extent with the verb anuyā́ti, as in the publ. tr.

Note the phonetic figure in pāvakáḥ purutámaḥ purū́ṇi, pṛthū́ni, esp. the last three words, of which the first two also etymologically related.
