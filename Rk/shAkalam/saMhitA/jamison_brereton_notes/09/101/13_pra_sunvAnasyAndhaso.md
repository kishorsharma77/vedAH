Ge takes ná in b as the neg. (flg. Sāy.) and asserts (n. 13), contra Old, that the presence of the mortal and the dog in this vs. (and the VS vs. Old cites) is an accident. But the position of ná in the pāda is that of the simile particle (though at least it would immed. precede the verb), and the wealth of similes in this tṛca supports a simile reading here as well. The point of the hemistich is that, like the human, the dog is attracted to the sound of the soma ritual, particularly the sound of the soma pressing, and invades it.

The 2nd hemistich begins like 1c: ápa śvā́nam … The simile in d, “as the Bhr̥gus did the Battler” (makháṃ ná bhṛ́gavaḥ), refers to what Ge calls an otherwise unknown saga. The makhá- is found as a defeated enemy of Indra in X.171.2, a hymn attributed to one Iṭa Bhārgava, the patronymic of the victors in our vs.. Note that the denom. verb makhasyate occurs in our vs. 5c.
