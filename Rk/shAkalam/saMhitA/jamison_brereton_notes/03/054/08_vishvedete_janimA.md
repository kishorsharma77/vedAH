The notion of the pair of H+E, separate but unified, is, in the 2nd hemistich, replaced by an even starker contrast, the One (ékam, neut. as noted in comm. to previous vs.), which controls the Many, with the Many first configured as oppositional pairs in the neuter: the moving and the fixed (éjad dhruvám), the walking/roaming and the flying (cárad patatrí). ékam is found at the end of its pāda, just as it is in the refrain to the next hymn (III.55).
