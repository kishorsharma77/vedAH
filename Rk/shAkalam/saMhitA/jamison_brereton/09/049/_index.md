Soma Pavamāna
Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: gāyatrī
Each verse of this hymn contains a form (two in vs. 3)  of the root pū “purify,”  all verbs except for the “filter” word (pavítram) in verse 4; the three middle verses  (3–5) also all contain the instrumental dhā́rayā “in a stream.” The hymn thus has  a tight lexical structure, and the content is similarly limited, to wishes for rain as  refreshment and nourishment (vss. 1, 3–4) and for increase in cattle (vs. 3). The first  four verses contain imperatives addressed to Soma, the last verse a 3rd-person past  tense, suggesting that the wishes expressed have been fulfilled.
