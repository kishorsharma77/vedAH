The abstract ūtí- ‘help’ is here personified, representing the Maruts. Cf. ## 09
where the identification of ūtáyaḥ and marútaḥ is explicit.

karúṇa- is found only here in the RV; neither here nor in its very few other occurrences in early Vedic (AV 1x, TS 1x) does it exhibit any semantic kinship with later karuṇa- ‘pitiful’, karuṇā ‘pity’, though Mayrhofer (EWA s.v.) makes a valiant effort to connect the meanings.
