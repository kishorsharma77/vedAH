Gr̥tsamada  
8 verses: jagatī 1–5, anuṣṭubh 6–8  
This is a composite hymn, whose structure is not entirely clear. The first three verses  seem to belong together, addressing first Heaven and Earth (vs. 1)  and then an  unidentified male divinity (2–3), while the remaining five verses are addressed to  various female divinities who are especially concerned with childbirth. However,  the metrical structure does not accord with the conceptual structure, as the meter  divides the hymn into verses 1–5 and 6–8.
