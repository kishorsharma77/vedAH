Once again the unspecified 2nd pl. subj. should be the priests/poets.

Note the extreme alliteration of … devī́ṃ dhíyaṃ dadhidhvam.

The morphological identity of this last form, dadhidhvam, can be queried. The three occurrences of this form are normally assigned to the perfect rather than the redupl. pres. (see esp. Kü 275), on the grounds that the -i-liaison is proper to the perfect. Yet no corresponding med. 2nd pl. impv. is built to the pres. stem; indeed, the posited correspondent (cf. Whitney, Gr. §668), the monstrous *dhaddhvam, is not attested in Vedic (as imperative, injunctive, or augmented imperfect). It is likely, therefore, that dadhidhvam serves as impv. to both pf. and redupl. pres., neutralizing the distinction between those T/A stems. In fact, given that in this passage it is parallel to the present impv. kṛṇudhvam in the same vs. and immediately follows on 45 an unambiguous redupl. pres. form to the same root and with the same obj. (8d dhíyaṃ dadhāmi, 9b dhíyaṃ dadhidhvam), a present-stem interpr. is favored. On ambig. pf. impvs. see my 2018 “The Vedic Perfect Imperative” (Fs. Lubotsky).
