134 (960)
Indra
Māndhātar Yauvanāśva (1–6a), Godhā (6b–7)
7 verses: mahāpaṅkti, except paṅkti 7
Although the Anukramaṇī assigns X.133 and X.134 to different poets, they seem to  be companion pieces. The latter hymn shares its meter, mahāpaṅkti, with the second  triplet (vss. 4–6) of X.133; both hymns are dedicated to Indra and share phraseol ogy (e.g., 133.4bc and 134.2cd); and 134 also has a refrain in its first six verses,  though one without the slangy sassiness of 133.1–6.
Like the last hymn, this one asks Indra for help against our enemies and also  for bounties. These are of course standard requests, but the imagery toward the  end of the hymn (vss. 5–6) is both precise and quirky, particularly the picture of  Indra using his ability like a long crook to pull down a high branch and shake down  its fruit, an image in turn compared to a goat doing the same with his forefoot.  (Anyone familiar with goat behavior will recognize this picture instantly.)
