Like the Udgātar, o omen-bird, you sing the sāman. Like the Son of the  Sacred Formulation, you recite at the pressings.
Like a bullish prize-winner [=stallion] when he has approached (mares)  with young, speak auspiciously to us in every way, omen-bird—
speak pleasantly to us in all ways, omen-bird.
