As Ge’s parallels show, this must be Savitar’s own ślóka.

The dat. svā́ya dhármaṇe would be easier to parse as “for his own support.” Both Ge and Re are rather cavalier about the dat. here. Ge tr. ‘nach’; Re claims it’s no different from the instr., further stating “indecision des cases obliques dans ce type de noms,” which seems like a dangerous interpretive principle to me.

In cd I take sávīmani with the participles of d. In that pāda aktúbhiḥ ‘through the nights’ strictly speaking goes with niveśáyan ‘causing to settle down’.
