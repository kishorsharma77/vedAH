Act. trans. (ā́) riṇanti, with priests vel sim. as subj. and soma as obj., contrasts with medial (ní) riṇīte in 2, with soma as subj. and a self-involved, reflexive-type meaning.

I supply ‘stall’ as the goal in the simile on the basis of passages containing ápi √i with pā́thaḥ as goal (I.162.2, II.3.9, III.8.9, VII.47.3). It is not necessary, however.
