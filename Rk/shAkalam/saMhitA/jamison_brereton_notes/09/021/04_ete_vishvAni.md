As often in the Soma hymns (see, e.g., comm. ad IX.9.1), hitá- is ambiguous, belonging either to √dhā, hence ‘placed’, or to √hi, hence ‘impelled’. Both Ge and Re opt for ‘placed’, and I admit that this works better with the loc. ráthe. But if they are merely “placed” at/on the chariot, we do not learn how they obtained the desirable things, and I therefore think ‘propelled’ is a necessary part of the scenario. Of course, it might be meant to be read both ways: “when placed at the chariot (and) propelled.”
