On svávām̐as nom. sg. of the -s-stem sv-ávas-, see AiG III.287. The Pp.

analyses it rather as svá-vān ‘possessing property’. Curiously Macdonell (Ved.

Reader, ad loc.) claims to be following the Pp., but tr. ‘aiding well’.

Most tr. take pratidoṣám as a temporal, “towards evening” or “every evening.” I think rather that it’s spatial, construed naturally with ásthāt ‘took his place, stood’.

The god is facing west. (Cf. Peter Pan: “straight on ‘til morning,” presumably meaning ‘east’.) The same expression, also of Savitar, is found in VI.71.4, though it does not clinch the interpretation.
