Bá¹›haspati On the divisions of the hymn, see publ. intro. Old and H.-P. Schmidt (cf. esp.

B+I 215) consider it to be three separate hymns; I instead see it as a unified composition with three parts. So also Gonda (Vedic Lit., 191) and, implicitly, Ge.

The hymn has been much tr.; besides the usual trio (Ge, Re [EVP 15.63-65], WG) also Macdonell (VRS), Maurer, Schmidt (B+I, vss. 1-6 216ff., 7-9 117, 10-11 96).
