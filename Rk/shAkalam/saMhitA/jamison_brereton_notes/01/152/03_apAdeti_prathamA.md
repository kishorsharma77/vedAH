See the publ. intro. for my view of the structure of this verse. I do not believe that the four pādas need to fit into a consistent cosmological scheme, as other tr. seem to, and in particular I do not think that cd refers to the morning sun or the like.

The accent on píparti in d probably results from its being in an antithetical construction with ní tārīt, though antithetical accent generally arises when the verbs are directly adjacent.
