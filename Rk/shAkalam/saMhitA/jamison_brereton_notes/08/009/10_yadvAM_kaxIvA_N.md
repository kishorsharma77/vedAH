The final pāda here is a variant of 3c and 9d, but the circumstances differ from both. Here the poet doesn’t contrast himself with other rival poets (as in 3) or with the larger group of “us” (as in 9), but asks that the Aśvins pay attention as they did to previous seers -- though actually not so previous: Kakṣīvant and Dīrghatamas are of course famous poets represented in the collections of Maṇḍala I (I.116-26 and I.140-64 respectively); Kakṣīvant is also identified in the Anukramaṇī as Dīrghatamas’s son (or descendant). A son/descendant of Vyaśva, Viśvāmitra, is the poet of VIII.23-26, and X.148 is attributed to Pṛthu (not Pṛthī) Vainya. So our poet seems to be asking for the same attention as these famous seers received, but they are not seers of the distant past but at most of a few generations ago, possibly even roughly contemporary (though the perfect juhā́va puts the invocation in the past).

They are both models and, to a certain extent, rivals.

Pṛthi in the publ. tr. should be corrected to Pṛthī.
