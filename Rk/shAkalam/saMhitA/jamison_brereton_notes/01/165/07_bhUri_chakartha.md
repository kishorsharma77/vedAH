In vs. 5 the Maruts spoke literally of yoking their teams to bring them for the journey, but in this vs. the same root √yuj is used metaphorically, in the gerundive yújya-, to indicate the Maruts’ powers that were available to be yoked/deployed by Indra, though he didn’t. Note also the adj. samāná- ‘common, joint’ (repeated from 1b) referring to the powers shared by the Maruts, in contrast to Indra’s constant lone state.

The question in this vs. is whose krátu- do the Maruts plan to follow. Acdg. to the JPB tr., it is Indra’s, but the tr. can’t stand exactly as given for syntactic reasons.

Because marutaḥ is unaccented, either krátvā has to belong to the yád clause or marutaḥ has to belong to the main cl. But the publ. tr. assigns marutaḥ to the dependent cl. and krátvā to the main cl: “we shall do many things in accordance with your purpose, o most powerful Indra, when we, o fellow Maruts, shall wish it.” Following the two syntactically licensed alternatives above, we must rather tr. either “We shall do many things, o most powerful Indra, when, o Maruts, we shall wish it in accordance with our/your will.” Or “We shall do many things, o most powerful Indra, in accordance with your/our will, o Maruts, when we shall wish it.” krátvā is perfectly placed for maximum ambiguity, between Indra and the Maruts. Taking it with the main cl. (the 2nd alternative tr. just given) favors an interpr. of Indra’s will; taking it with the subord. cl. (the 1st alternative) favors the Maruts’ will. That, I think, is the correct interpr. The Maruts contrast Indra’s actions, which were performed with the Maruts’ standing by on the scene, with their own prospective actions, which will depend on their own intention, not Indra’s design or timetable.

The dueling vocatives in d, índra and marutaḥ, are notable, esp. because they encase the word krátvā whose crucial ambiguity we have just discussed. Since we must assume that the 1st

-ps. speaker is a Marut or Maruts, the pl. vocative to the
group is of course striking -- though well within the limits of poetic self-address we find elsewhere in the text (see disc. in my "Poetic Self-Reference in the Rig Veda and the Persona of Zarathustra,” Fs. Skjaervø, 2009). In this case I imagine a “spokesMarut” who takes the lead in addressing Indra but also turns to his own group for a chorus of affirmation (of the type, “right, guys?!”).
