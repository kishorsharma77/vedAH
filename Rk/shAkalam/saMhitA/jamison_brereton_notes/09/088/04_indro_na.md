In order to connect the comparison with Indra more clearly to the whole vs., I would now be inclined to tr. “Like Indra, who is the doer of great deeds, you are are a stronghold-splitting smiter of obstacles,” though this now makes it less clear that Soma is being compared to Indra also in his general capacity of doer of deeds. The Sanskrit is more forgiving.

Pāda c is metrically defective; see esp. Old for disc. After suggesting, and rejecting, various fixes, he considers the possibility that the pāda ended with hantā́, which was redactionally eliminated by word haplology, since the next pāda begins with hantā́. This would get us the proper syllable count, though, as Old notes, the cadence would be bad, in that the antepenult would be heavy: … áhināmnāṃ

*hantā́#. Despite the problem of the cadence, this seems like the most attractive
solution, and I would now slightly alter the tr. to “Because, like Pedu's (horse) (you are) *the smiter of those with serpents' names, you are the smiter of every Dasyu.” On the serpent-smiting horse that the Aśvins gave Pedu, one of their clients, see I.117.9, 188.9. Unfortunately this is all we know about the horse’s exploits.
