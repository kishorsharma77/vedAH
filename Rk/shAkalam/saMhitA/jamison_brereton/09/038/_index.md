Soma Pavamāna
Rahūgaṇa Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Like the previous hymn, attributed to the same poet, this hymn is unified by the  repetition of a pronominal phrase at the beginning of every verse (eṣá syá “this  very one,” except for vs. 2, which has only the first pronoun). It, too, concerns  Soma’s journey through the filter (especially the first and last verses, 1 and 6) and  his manipulation by the officiant’s fingers (vss. 2, 3). The hymn is enlivened by meta
phors and similes, particularly those of verse 4.
