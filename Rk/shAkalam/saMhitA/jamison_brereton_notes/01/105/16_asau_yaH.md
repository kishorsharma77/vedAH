Contains echoes of a number of previous vss. First, the asaú yáḥ opening recalls the amī́yé openings of the two omphalos vss. (9-10), as well as the the amī́yé of 5a, which anticipates the omphalos.

The “Ādityan path” (with one of the very rare instances of ādityá- used adjectivally), which is not to be overstepped (ná … atikráme), recalls exactly 6cd … aryamṇáḥ … pathā́, áti krāmema “Along the path of Aryaman might we pass beyond [/step over] …” The path theme is also found in 11c and later in 18b.

The pravā́cyam of b repeats the proclamation theme that has also been prominent in the hymn: pravā́cyam in 10c (an omphalos vs.), supravācanam (12b).
