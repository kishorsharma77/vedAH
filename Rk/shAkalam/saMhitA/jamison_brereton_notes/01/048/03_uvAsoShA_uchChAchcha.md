Most tr. take jīrā́as agentive with an objective genitive (e.g., Ge “die Wagen in Bewegung setzend”), but I think this unlikely because it would be the only such usage of jīrá-. (gó-jīra- in IX.110.3 is sometimes so interpreted [Ge ‘die Kühe zutreibend’] but need not be.) Although not taking jīrā́as transitive leaves ráthānām without any clear governing word, that seems preferable to claiming a unique value for jīrá- in this passage. That Dawn may be “the lady of the chariots” is also suggested by her hundred chariots in 7c.

The referent of yé in c and the affiliation of that rel. cl. are disputed. Ge takes the rel. pronoun as referring to the ráthānām of b. This has the merit of associating the rel. with an adjacent noun in the proper number and gender and keeping the relative clause syntactically confined to the verse in which it appears. However, it affords these chariots more agency and significance than I think they deserve. Instead, the rel. cl. of cd seems to group more naturally with the identically structured yé clause in 4ab, which also has a 3rd pl. presential reflexive verb preceded by a loc. pl.

and also contains a genitive referrring to Dawn. The two clauses also begin with a metrically irregular 11-syllable pāda with a rest right before the caesura, an irregularity that also speaks for their association. This pair of relative clauses is resolved by the main clause in 4cd. Such an enjambed structure is characteristic of pragāthas. (Re also take the two verses this way.) Then there is the question of the meaning of dadhriré. It belongs to the root √dhṛ ‘hold, support’, and in this (rare) middle usage seems to have reflexive value ‘hold oneself’/‘hold oneself fast’, with the possible pregnant sense ‘hold oneself ready’ (so Re, WG, Ge n.). I take it as having slightly different meanings in simile and frame (a favored poetic strategy of Vedic bards). In the simile it depicts sailors (or some sort of boatsmen) standing firm against the rigors of the voyage, whereas in the frame the subjects (who are identified in the parallel rel. clause of 4ab as patrons) hold themselves ready to give, an action that is also the topic of that parallel rel.

clause. In fact, one could almost construe (or supply) the dānā́ya of 4b with dadhriré as well as with its own clause.
