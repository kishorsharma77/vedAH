With the standard tr. I take yéna in pāda as referring to enā́yā́mena in the previous vs. (12c).

I tr. dhānyà- lit., ‘related to grain (dhānā́), as ‘granular’, because I think it refers both to the raindrops, shaped like grain, and the actual grain that results from the rain.

I.57.1 rā́dho víśvā́yu suggests that viśvā́yu belongs to what precedes, rather than to saúbhagam as Ge and Re take it.
