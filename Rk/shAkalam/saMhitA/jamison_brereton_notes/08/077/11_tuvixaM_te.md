sūmáya- is generally analyzed as having the adverbial prefix su- ‘good’, hence ‘aus gutem Stoff’ (Ge). However, AiG II.2.770 reports a suggestion of Thieme's (apparently only reported in AiG, not publ.) that it's ‘aus Eber(-zahn) verfertigt’, with an unextended root noun sū- ‘(wild) pig, boar’, which is the basis of sūkará- ‘boar’ (already RV VII.55.4) and which has numerous IE cognates.

Although Mayrhofer explicitly rejects this suggestion (KEWA, s.v. sūkará-; EWA, s.vv. MAY1 , sūkará-), context favors Thieme’s suggestion. The boar Emuṣa was clearly a formidable opponent of Indra’s, and the use of a weapon made from the same animal to defeat it makes good sense from the point of view of sympathetic magic. Consider also the association of boars with ritual of kingship, and note, in particular, that using parts of the boar for the armor and weaponry of warriors is found elsewhere (cf. Odysseus’s boar’s tusk helmet and the general disc. in Jamison 1999 [Penelope and the Pigs], ClAnt. 18: 258-70). The unextended root noun sūcould be preserved in this old myth, esp. since it could be assimilated to the prefix su-.

My interpretation of pāda d essentially follows Scar (301, 516); see also EWA, s.v. ARD.
