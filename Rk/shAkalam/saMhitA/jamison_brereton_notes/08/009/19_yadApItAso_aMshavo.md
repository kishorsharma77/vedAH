ā́pīta- is better derived from √pī ‘swell’ (so Ge, EWA s.v. PAYI ) than to √pā ‘drink’ (Lub, Re [though Re allows a double sense]).

Pāda d requires a verb to be supplied with prá. I follow Re in supplying ‘wake’, on the basis of vs. 17. Ge kṛnvata (on the basis of I.186.10), thus “… (lassen) … den Vorrang.” His model seems awfully distant, given that prá bodhaya appeared two vss. previously.
