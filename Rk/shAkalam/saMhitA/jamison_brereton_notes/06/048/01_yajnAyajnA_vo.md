I take the two pādas of the first hemistich as entirely parallel, with an instr.

āmreḍita followed by a dat. of benefit/purpose. Others (Ge, Re, Klein [āmreḍitas]) instead interpr. dákṣase as a infinitive or quasi-infinitive.

The 2nd hemistich has disharmony of number between the expressed subject, pl. vayám, and the 1st sg. verb śaṃsiṣam, a rare but not unheard-of phenomenon. Here we can link it to the āmreḍitas that dominate the vs., esp. the doubled preverb prápra, in tmesis from the finite śaṃsiṣaṃ. Perhaps this serves as a sort of individuating feature: “I after I …,” that is, “we.” This cannot be conveyed in Engl., though I admit that the publ. tr. “we — that is, I —” is itself barely English.
