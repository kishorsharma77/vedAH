As just noted, this is a meta-summary final vs., referring to the very hymns (imā́gíraḥ) invoking Savitar at the present moment. The 2nd pāda focuses on his hands: pūrṇágabhastim … supāṇím “having full fists [that is, fists full of goods] and good palms.” This provides a semantic, but not lexical ring with the beginning of the hymn, where many good things are in Savitar’s hand (háste 1c). (I would in fact have tr. 4b -pāṇí- as ‘hand’ but used ‘palm’ instead to make the lexical difference clear in English.) The ‘hand’ focus is also continued in the two arms (bāhū́) in 2ab, though that is so standard an image of Savitar that it may be independent here.
