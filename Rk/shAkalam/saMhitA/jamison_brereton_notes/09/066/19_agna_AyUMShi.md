Since pavase has an obj. ā́yūṃṣi, it would be desirable to have the preverb ā́, which has transitivizing function with this root. This is easily done: ā́yūṃṣi can be decomposed into ā́ā́yūṃṣi without change to the Saṃhitā text, though it is contra to the Pp.

This preverb in tmesis shows up apparently 2nd in the clause because it follows the zeroposition voc. ágne.
