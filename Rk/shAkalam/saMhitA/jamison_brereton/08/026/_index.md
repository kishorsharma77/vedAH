Aśvins (1–19), Vāyu (20–25)
Viśvamanas Vaiyaśva or Vyaśva Āṅgirasa
25 verses: uṣṇih, except gāyatrī 16–19, 21, 25 and anuṣṭubh 20, arranged in trcas, with ̥ an extra verse, 19, at the end of the Aśvin sequence
A long and rather repetitive hymn. The first nineteen verses are dedicated to the Aśvins  and, as usual, urge them to drive their chariot to our sacrifice and to give us goods in  return. There is little novel to capture the audience; the most striking image is found in  verse 13: the unnamed god Agni, dressed in sacrifices like a bride in her wedding finery.
The final six verses belong to Vāyu, deified Wind, another god associated with  the early-morning sacrifice, who receives the first soma drink there. He too is called  to make the journey to our sacrifice and reward us for our offerings. He is twice (vss.  21, 22)  designated as the son-in-law of Tvaṣṭar, the fashioner god—a somewhat  surprising identification, given the tangled marital situation of Tvaṣṭar’s daughter  as tantalizingly sketched in X.17.1–2—where Vāyu is not in the picture.
