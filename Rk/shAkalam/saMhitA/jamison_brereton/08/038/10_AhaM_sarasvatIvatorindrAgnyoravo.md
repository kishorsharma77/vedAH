The following group of hymns, VIII.39–42, is attributed to Nābhāka Kāṇva, who  names himself several times in VIII.40 and 41. The group is characterized by the  slangy refrain that puns on his name, nábhantām anyaké same “let  all the other  squirts burst!” The poet is also partial to the mahāpaṅkti meter, found in VIII.39–41.
