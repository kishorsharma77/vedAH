The verse has an extra pāda (h), which serves as the tag-pāda to g. Given the difficulties in the verse, the extra pāda just provides more occasion for bewilderment.

The hapax iṣṭáni- in the paired pādas bc has been variously interpreted. Gr takes it to (n)is + √stan ‘thunder’ (‘thunder’ explicitly rejected by Old). Ge does not comment but his tr. ‘sich ausbreitend’ suggests a derivation from √tan ‘stretch’; his tr. is echoed by Re (‘s’étendant’), though in his n. he suggests that the first element is the zero-grade root noun to √yaj ‘sacrifice’, encouraged by Old. The currently prevailing interpr. is probably Hoffmann’s (reported in KEWA, EWA) ‘spreading nourishment’, found in WG. This is certainly possible; however, I favor √stan ‘thunder’, despite Old’s disapproval, but with the preverb ví. The Saṃhitā text reads … urvárāsviṣṭánir (b) / ā́rtanāsviṣṭániḥi (c), but both loc. plurals require metrical distraction: urvárās u viṣṭánir (etc.). The Pp. reads urvárāsu / iṣtániḥ (etc.), but nothing prevents reading urvárāsu / viṣtániḥ from the distracted -s(u)vi- sequence. Although vi √stan is not found until very late, it would not be a difficult idiom to create, esp.

given the widespread ví √dyut ‘flash forth as lightning’ in the same pragmatic sphere.

The thunder would thematically continue the noise of the first pāda and the association with the Maruts, storm gods.

Pāda c contains a 2nd hapax, ā́rtanāsu, which both Ge and WG refuse to tr.

(though see WG n. for a different suggestion) and Old, having offered a few suggestions, refuses to analyze. Re tr. “les terres steriles” but without comment (though the tr. probably stems from Gr’s ‘übel, öde, Misernten bringend’). My own suggestion is quite speculative, but in this situation there seems no other choice. The pāda is a syllable short; HvN in fact divide up the first vowel, reading ā́ártanāsu, but a stem ártanā- does us no more good than ā́rtanā-. I suggest supplying the syllable nir to open the pāda (and the word, hence *nirā́rtanāsu); this nir can be generated from the final syllable of the preceding pāda (iṣṭán)nir, or rather we can imagine a haplology: iṣṭánir, *nirā́rtanāsu. This posited stem *nirā́rtanā- would belong to nír √ṛ, most prominent in the well-attested nírṛti- ‘chaos, disorder, dissolution’. The loc. pl. pairing in bc would then contrast the productive (ápnasvant-) fields/meadows with their negative counterpart, disorderly and useless.

Note the alliteration in d: ā́dad dhavyā́ny ādadír, followed by ádha beginning f (as well as ā́d beginning 5d).

As Ge points out (n. 6d), ā́dat can be the impf. to √ad ‘eat’ as well as belonging to ā́√dā ‘take’, though he doesn’t incorporate this pun into his tr. Agni as the eater of oblations is of course a common trope.

hárṣato hṛ́ṣīvataḥ in f is a nice etymological figure, though in the context of this hymn barely deserving mention.

Most tr. take the náraḥ of h as ordinary, human men, but I think it refers rather to the Maruts. śubhé (and śúbh- in general) is one of their signature words; cf., e.g., I.88.2 śubhé kám yānti and, with náraḥ referring to them, V.52.8 … té śubhé náraḥ. The mention of the Maruts here would form a ring with their appearance in pāda a.
