On nemanníśaḥ see the lengthy treatment by Scar (55-56). I take párīṇasaḥ somewhat loosely, following Gr, as an adverbial ablative.

In c Ge takes sáhaḥ as a pāda-final truncation of instr. sáhasā as sometimes elsewhere, but this seems unnecessary. In the final verse of the preceding hymn (55.8) Indra took sáhas- into his body. It does not seem odd that he would here be identified as sáhas- itself. The odd placement of nū́may support this analysis: the NP vidáthasya … sáhaḥ may be structurally parallel to pátiṃ dákṣasya, and the 2ndposition nū́could mark the second NP as a new syntactic unit.
