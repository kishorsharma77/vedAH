Indra gets the last word in this hymn and, having described his situation in the direst of terms, ends with a note of hope and coming triumph: the falcon’s arrival with the soma, to be treated (in even more enigmatic terms) in two nearby hymns, IV.26-27. Since in our hymn the new-born Indra drank soma in Tvaṣṭar’s house (3c) and presumably had a good dose of it before the Vṛtra battle, the falcon’s stolen soma cannot be the primal soma, though it sometimes mythologically seems to parallel the primal stealing of fire in the Prometheus myth.

A dog-cooker (śvapaca-) in later texts is a person living outside of societal norms (cf., e.g., MDŚ III.92), grouped with those who have fallen from caste and so forth.

Notice that Indra here finds no one to be merciful to him (ná … vivide marḍitā́ram), in contrast to the merciful waters when he was a baby (8c).

Most take the dishonored wife to be Indra’s own, but no wife has intruded on the family drama we’ve been observing. I assume rather that this is another reference to his mother, who, now that she is a widow, receives slighting treatment.

IV.19. Indra
