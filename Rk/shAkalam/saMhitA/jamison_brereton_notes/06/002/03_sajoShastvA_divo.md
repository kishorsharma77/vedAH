The standard tr. take juhvé to √hu ‘pour, offer’, but this causes a problem with the main cl. verb, the pres. indhate ‘kindle’, if we assume that the pf. of √hu has some kind of preterital sense. It does not make ritual sense to offer the melted butter in the fire before kindling it. Ge avoids the problem by translating with a present, but this is ad hoc. With Sāy. I take the verb to √hvā ‘call’ instead, since invocations can be and regularly are made after the fire is kindled. Although Kü follows the √hu interpr. (605), he admits that the alternative should be seriously considered (n. 1316).

It might be objected that a pf. to the seṭ root √hvā should be read trisyllabically (juhu ve), as it indeed is in X.149.5, but as Kü points out (n. 1317), an undoubted 3rd sg. pf. to √hvā, juhve in I.32.6, is disyllabic. (The sequencing of actions problem with √idh -- √hu could be avoided if the former means something like ‘fan the flames’, an action that could indeed follow the pouring of the butter into a banked fire. But I don’t know that we have any evidence for this sense -- beyond the fact that indhate belongs to a pres. stem and could have durative value.) For further support for my interpr. of this vs. see immed. below.
