Though it modifies asmā́kam ‘of us’ and “we” are definitely male, śipriṇīnām ‘of the (well-)lipped ones’ is a feminine gen. pl. The form must be contextually motivated: the other two pādas end with (masc.) gen. pls. in -Vnām / - Vnaam (somapā́vanām [my preference, for HvN somapā́vnãm], sákhīnãm). Esp. the latter, with -īnãm, invites a type of dittography: *śipriṇãm à śipriṇīnãm. Although this form reminds us of the equally unexpected fem. for masc. návyasīnãm V.53.10, 58.1, I explain the latter differently. See comm. ad V.53.10.
