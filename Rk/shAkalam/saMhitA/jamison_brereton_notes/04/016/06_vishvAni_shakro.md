See Ge’s long note (6b) on the mixture of Vṛtra and Vala themes in this vs. Ge (/WG) supplies ‘deeds’ with náryāṇi (“Mannestaten”) without indicating what Sanskrit word he is thinking of. It should surely be ápāṃsi ‘labors’, which regularly shows up with some form of nṛ́- or a derivative thereof (on nári ápāṃsi see comm. ad VIII.96.19). Assuming this is the correct underlying noun, we can identify a buried pun: apáḥ (apó in sandhi) ‘waters’ opens the 2nd pāda; it is phonologically reminiscent of ápaḥ ‘labor’.
