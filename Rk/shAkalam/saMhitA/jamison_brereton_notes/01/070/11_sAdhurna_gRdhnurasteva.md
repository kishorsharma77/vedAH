What referent to supply with the adjectives sādhúḥ and gṛdhnúḥ isn’t entirely clear. I follow Ge with ‘horse’, because sādhú- several times modifies horses (see Ge’s cited parallels), though Re’s ‘warrior’ is equally plausible contextually.

As disc. in the art. cit., I do not believe, with Old (SBE, Noten) and others, that this verse is a later addition. Rather it is a summary verse of the whole threehymn Vaiśvānara sequence, or even of all of Parāśara’s Dvipadā Virāj hymns to Agni, and describes the Vaiśvānara as the ideal warrior and leader for the united clans embarking on a joint enterprise.
