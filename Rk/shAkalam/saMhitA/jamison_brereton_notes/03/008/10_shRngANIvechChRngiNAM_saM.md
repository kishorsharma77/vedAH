Contrary to the standard tr., I think there is a change of subject in the 2nd half-verse. Rather than calling on the posts to help us, we turn again to the gods, who are the likely subject of avantu, just as they were in 8c. The types of help we ask them for are distinct but complementary: help for our sacrifice in 8c, help in battle and competition in 10d, a theme introduced by the vihavá- ‘competing invocation’ in 10c. The vā of 10c signals this disjunction and the return of the gods as subject.

Although Klein (DGRV II.203) suggests reading vā here as if for vaí, given that the hymn contains several loosely construed vā-s (1d, 6b), this does not seem like a good idea.
