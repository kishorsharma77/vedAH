Ge again supplies “zu gewinnen” in both hemistichs. I once again see no reason to do so. He also takes the rel. cl. of c (yéna dráviṇam aśnávāma) as dependent on ā́rṣeyám: “um … uns den Namen eines R̥ṣi zu gewinnen, durch den wir zu Reichtum gelangen können.” This ignores the parallel abhí’s of cd and also assumes an embedded rel. cl. (though not all that embedded). Re takes ārṣeyám as a 2nd obj. of aśnávāma: “afin que nous obtenions la richesse, afin l’état de Prophète …” This is somewhat less disruptive than Ge’s, but assumes a purpose function for yéna that has no good precedent, as far as I know. My own interpr. - supplying a gapped acc. ‘that’ as antecedent for yéna -- seems minimally disruptive and assumes that the insistent structure with abhí arṣa ACC continues in this pāda. The same interpr. is found in Hettrich (Hypotaxe, 550-51): “(fliesse uns das) zu, wodurch wir Reichtum erlangen werden.” The interpr. of Ge and Re also minimize or ignore the only clever part of this tṛca, which provides a climax of sorts. With the pattern abhí (…) arṣa “rush towards …” inescapably established, the poet produces a phonological play on this phrase in the last pāda: abhy ārṣeyám, where the acc. goal, beginning ārṣ-, plays on the impv.

arṣa (the play also noted by Ge, n. 51d). ārṣeyá- is found only here in the RV, though it is extremely common in Vedic prose.
