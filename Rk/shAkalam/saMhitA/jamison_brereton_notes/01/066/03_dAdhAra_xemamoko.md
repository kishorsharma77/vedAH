As Re notes, we might expect suffix-accented jetā́with gen. jánānām. WG, following Tichy (1995: 343-44), interpret the gen. in datival function (“als Sieger für die Menschen”) to avoid nominal rection with a root-accented agent noun. But since this accentual “rule” is often broken, I see no problem with the standard interpr. as objective gen. “conquerer of peoples.”
