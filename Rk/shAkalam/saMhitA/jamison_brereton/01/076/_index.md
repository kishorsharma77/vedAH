Agni  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn begins (vs. 1) with anxious questions about how best to worship Agni  in order to harness his powers. The structure of this question verse is reminiscent  of verse 3 of the previous hymn (I.75), with each pāda containing a separate  query; however, the questions here are more focused on how best to please Agni,  and the longer line of triṣṭubh meter makes the questions seem less abrupt than  in the gāyatrī of I.75.3. As in I.75 the questions here do not receive explicit  answers. Instead the poet devotes most of the rest of the hymn to detailing Agni’s  duties and seeking Agni’s aid as ritual performer and priest (see esp. vss. 2, 4), to  bring the gods, especially Indra (see vs. 3c), to the ritual ground and to sacrifice  to them.
