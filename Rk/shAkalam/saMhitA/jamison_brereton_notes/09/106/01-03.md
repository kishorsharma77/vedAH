All three vss. in this tṛca contain final 4-syllable sequences that could be syntactically distanced from what precedes, hence a likely 8 8 / 8 4 Uṣṇih type (so also Old). In vs. 1 this piece is svarvídaḥ, the signature word that recurs in the same metrical position in 4 (as svarvídam) and 9.

Vss. 2 and 3 are also lexically linked: sānasí- (2a, 3b), jaítrasya (2c) / -jít (3d).
