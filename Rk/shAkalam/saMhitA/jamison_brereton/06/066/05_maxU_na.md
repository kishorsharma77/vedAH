Those for whom even right away [=right after their birth] the irrepressible  one [=Pr̥śni] was not there to give milk—those who, assuming the bold  name “Marut,”
did not (stand still) like posts, (but were themselves) irrepressible in their  greatness. Even now [/never] would the one of good drops [=Pr̥śni]
appease (those) mighty ones.
