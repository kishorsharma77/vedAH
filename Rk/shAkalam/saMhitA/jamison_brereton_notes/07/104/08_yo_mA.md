The lexeme abhí √cakṣ here seems almost a substitute for abhí √car ‘conjure against’, and note that the object (“me”) is qualified by the part. cárantam.

Re notes that this is the only RVic pejorative ex. of well-attested abhí √cakṣ, which generally means ‘look upon, look towards, oversee’ in neutral or positive sense. It is notable that in our passage the action of this visual idiom is accomplished by verbal means (“untruthful words” ánṛtebhir vácobhiḥ). Re remarks that it coincides “avec le passage de «voir» à «dire»” -- without specifying what he means.
