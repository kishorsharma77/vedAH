The lexeme ví √pā in later Vedic is regularly found in specialized sense in the Sautrāmaṇī ritual, and there it refers to the feat of separating the surā from the other liquid (milk or soma). This sense and context are already found in the late RVic hymn X.131.4 in the med. part. vipipānā́. See Old ad loc. (and NGGW 1893, 348- 49). Though it has been suggested that this usage belongs to a separate root √pā ‘go’ (see, e.g., EWA s.v. PĀ3 ), this seems unnecessary and somewhat perverse. Although the other ví √pā passages (all medial) don't have a Sautrāmaṇī association, I think they (or most of them) belong to this same lexeme, though Old is less certain. Here the stones are separating the soma juice from the stalk. In IV.16.3 the pressing stone is also the subj., and there is a pressing stone association in III.53.10. However, I.112.15 is more enigmatic. The subj. there is an ant (or someone called “ant”), vamrá-, and the vignette occupies half a pāda in a list of the Aśvins’ helpful deeds.
