The echo of vs. 1 noted at the end of vs. 4 continues here, where devásya trātúḥ picks up trātā́of 1a (as well as trā́sīthām in 1b). The abl. “(protect) from …” in 1c sáhīyasaḥ … mártāt recurs in cd jányād áṃhasaḥ … mitríyāt.

The standard tr. begin a new clause at the beginning of d and take mitríyāt with uruṣyet. This is not impossible; nonetheless I prefer to construe mitró mitríyāt with c. The strict parallelism/gapping of the 1st part, plus the pāda-medial utá naḥ in d I find too compelling to ignore, since utá generally begins new clauses. It is true, however, that uruṣyá- is several times found with áṃhasaḥ. The purport is much the same either way.

The standard tr. take jánya- as referring to foreign people (this goes back at least to Gr, meaning 2a). I do not know of any evidence for this interpr., and in fact all clear passages indicate that it’s someone/-thing belonging to one’s own people (which would be the default reading of such a deriv., in my view). Here the contrast is between problems internal to the group and those coming from allies (external but contractually connected).

Pāda d revives the question of wide space, here with a god making it for mortals (us), which might give support to the Re / WG interpr. of 1d (see above).

Nonetheless, I think the overall structure of the hymn fits better with my interpr.
