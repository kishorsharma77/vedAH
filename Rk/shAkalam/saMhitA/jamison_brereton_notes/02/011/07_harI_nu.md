The three augmented aorists in this vs. are striking, esp. because two of them are extremely marginal: the s-aor. seen in asvārṣṭām (√svar) is found otherwise in the RV only as 3rd sg. ásvār in late X.148.5; áraṃsta is the only form of this s-aor. in the RV. Both have well-attested 1st cl. present stems with the same meaning, and it is, at first, surprising in this narrative context that we don’t find imperfects. But as IH suggested to me, if we follow the interpr. of the hymn in the publ. intro. and in Brereton 1985, whereby the apparent events of the mythic past—the spreading out of the earth, the coming to rest of the mountain—actually refer to the ritual here-andnow, esp. the establishment of the fire, then the augmented aorists will force an immediate past interpr. and therefore reveal the poet’s intent behind the apparent recital of mythic events.

I would be inclined to take cid with sariṣyán, rather than with párvataḥ, hence “the mountain, though about to run, has come to rest,” rather than “even the mountain …” Note the use of the future participle to express past prospective value in subordination to a preterital main verb and see comm. ad 10b below.
