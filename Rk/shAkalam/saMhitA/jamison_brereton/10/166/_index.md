Against Rivals  
R̥ṣabha Vairāja or R̥ṣabha Śākvara  
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except mahāpaṅkti 5  
The extremely aggressive 1st-person speaker of this hymn proclaims his triumph  over his rivals and their utter humiliation. Using the well-nigh universal tropes of  high and low, he repeatedly emphasizes the spatial (and thus conceptual) position  of his defeated enemies, who are literally beneath his feet (vss. 2, 5; see also vss. 3–4).  Verse 4 is notable for the trio of attributes that the speaker seizes from his rivals,  a set that easily accommodates a trifunctional (Dumézilian) analysis: “cognition”  as the higher mental power appropriate to the priestly First Function, “command  
ment” representative of the warrior-ruler Second Function, and “company, assem bly” the Third Function mass of followers. Although we are not over-sympathetic  to the Dumézilian paradigm, this particular passage gains resonance from such an  analysis.
