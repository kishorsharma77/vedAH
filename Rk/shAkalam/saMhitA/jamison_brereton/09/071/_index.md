Soma Pavamāna
R̥ṣabha Vaiśvāmitra
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 9
The subject of this hymn is, as so often, Soma’s journey across the filter to take  his seat as ritual drink after the various stages of preparation. The journey is pre sented as a straightforward trajectory on the one hand, with his arrival among  the gods and his union with the praise hymn the last step, in verse 8. But the  hymn is also structured by a number of responsions between the earlier and the  later verses; note especially 2b and 8a, with the almost identical phrases “the  color that is his” and “this is his color.” In this particular example the forward  movement of the journey and the architectonic structure of responsions comple ment each other, for in verse 2 Soma sheds his original form and color and in  verse 8 he gains new ones.
