When the barren cow [=kindling stick] gave birth all at once as she was  being driven/anointed, she, though faltering, did so unfalteringly,  
since she has her own herdsmen [=priests].  
When the son [=Agni] was born before his two parents [=kindling  
sticks], the cow [=lower stick] swallowed the peg [=upper stick]â€”if  
they should inquire.
