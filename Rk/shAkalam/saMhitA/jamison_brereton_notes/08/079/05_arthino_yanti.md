The most difficult verse in the hymn by far and perhaps not accidently the middle verse. It is striking among other things for its use of indicative (yánti), subjunctive (gáchān), and optative (vavṛjyuḥ) in the same sentence, and for the juxtaposition of the two roots √i and √gam with the same subject in an if-then construction. For the latter, see Re’s disc.: he suggests persuasively that √i with acc. indicates the goal towards which one is proceeding, but √gam with acc. the attainment of the goal, though I am not at all sure this functional division holds throughout the uses of these presents in the RV.

I interpr. the verse within Ge’s general scheme: that the subject throughout is the soma priests and the thirsting man (tṛ́ṣyataḥ) of c is a competing priest -- or at least someone who covets the largesse of the giver (dadúṣaḥ) in b that rightly belongs to the hard-working priests named in a (arthínaḥ).

The sense of the pf. opt. vavṛjyuḥ in c is a bit difficult to grasp, primarily because the root √vṛj ‘twist’, etc., so seldom appears without a preverb. I think ‘deflect’ or ‘thwart’ is what is intended. As usual, I do not think that the fact that the optative is built to the perfect stem adds any particular “perfect” nuance, though I do have to admit in this case that there are optative forms built to another tense/aspect stem, namely the root aor. (vṛjyām 1x, vṛjyās 3x, vṛjyā́ma 1x), all in the idiom with pári.
