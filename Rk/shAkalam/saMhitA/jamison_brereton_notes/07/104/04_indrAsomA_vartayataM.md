The lexeme úd √takṣ (lit. ‘fashion up’) that opens the 2nd hemistich occurs only here in the RV, and at least acdg. to Monier Wms nowhere else in Skt.; it was clearly artificially generated to contrast with the verb nijū́rvathaḥ (‘grind down’) at the end of the hemistich, to highlight the úd ‘up’ / ní ‘down’ contrast.
