I do not see any semantic/functional difference between the imperfect asanot in a and b and the insistent pf. sasā́na of vss. 8-9, though we might assume that the poet made the choice apurpose. Both Ge and Re render the forms in the same way (as do I); WG tr. sasā́na as ‘er hat erlangt’ and asanot as ‘gewann’. Although I find the idea of rendering the two different grammatical forms differently appealing, I’m not sure that losing the root connection is worth it.
