The voc. indo ‘o drop’ in b is incongruous in this context, and as Ge points out, the 1st hemistich seems to have been adapted from a Soma hymn, where ‘drop’ would be appropriate. He adduces I.91.19 (c: gayasphā́naḥ pratáraṇaḥ …) and 12, whose 1st pāda also contains gayasphā́naḥ, though the matches are not exact and neither of the cited pādas contains indo. However, gayasphā́na- is found only in those two passages and in our vs. 78
