R̥tudevatāḥ (Sequential Deities)  
Medhātithi Kāṇva  
12 verses: gāyatrī  
This hymn has a precise ritual application: it accompanies a series of ritual offer ings (R̥tugrahas “sequential cups”) made in a fixed order to a fixed sequence of  gods by a similarly fixed sequence of priests, roughly matched in function to  the gods they serve. (See, e.g., Eggeling Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2: 319 n. 1.) The same sequence is found in the two hymns II.36–37, which together are entirely  parallel to this hymn. (See further remarks in the introductions to those hymns.)  The divine order and the priestly counterparts are the following. (The priests  are not all mentioned by title in this hymn, but those not bracketed are found in  II.36–37.)
