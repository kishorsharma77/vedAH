All Gods (Bird of Ill Omen)  
Kapota Nairrtḁ  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Though the Anukramaṇī identifies the dedicands as the All Gods, the hymn is  entirely devoted to countering the possible evil effects of a bird of ill-omen, the  dove of death, sent as a messenger from Yama, the lord of the dead. Not surpris ingly, given their style and contents, the verses of this hymn are found in variant  form in the Atharvaveda (AVŚ VI.27, 29.1, 28.1).
