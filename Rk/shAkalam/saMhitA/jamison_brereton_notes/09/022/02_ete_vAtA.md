As in the immed. preceding hymn (21.2), this vs. lacks a finite verb and can be attached either to vs. 1 or vs. 3 or both.

My supplied “(surging)” isn’t strictly necessary -- neither Ge nor Re supplies anything at all -- but it seemed to me that something dynamic was needed here, for wind, rain, and fire.

IX.22.3, 5: Note vy ànaśuḥ in both vss. (3c, 5b), implicitly connecting Soma’s pervasion of poetry with his pervasion of cosmic space. This repetition could also define vs. 4, the middle vs. of the hymn, as an omphalos, but that vs. doesn’t seem to do much if so. For further exx.

of √(n)aś see ad 4-6.
