Though the syntax is kept absolutely constant - nom. sg. + gen. pl. - there is a shifting functional relationship between the head noun and its genitive in the seven phrases here: the first two are roles Soma performs for the group identified by the gen., the next three a particular, and superior, individual token from the group (though the third pairing, “seer for/of the inspired poets,” is ambiguous between the first type and the second), and the last is sort of a negative version of the role he plays for the group.
