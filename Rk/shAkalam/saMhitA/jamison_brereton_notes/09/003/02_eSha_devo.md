The expression vipā́kṛtáḥ ‘created by poetic inspiration’ may seem a bit extreme -- after all soma/Soma exists and previously existed independently of the poets. But the usual RVic power attributed to the word is in play here: poetry brings to realization the gods and divine forces on the ritual ground.

The s-stem hváras- belongs to the root √hvṛ ‘go crookedly, swerve’; in a soma context it refers to the curls and tufts of the wool on the sheepskin that serves as the soma filter, trapping the impurities in the just pressed juice. This physical reading seems preferable to the “obstacle” interpr. of Ge, Re, etc. In this regard, I would point out that the smooth, fluffy, brushed sheepskins available commercially are misleading: sheep on the hoof, particularly the shaggy mountain breeds presumably familiar to the Vedic people, have much more rugged and irregular wool.
