The tváṣṭā here has been prepared for by 4b táṣṭā, and both appear in alliterative phrases: táṣṭeva tátsināya and tváṣṭā takṣat.

Another word with a standard double sense: ráṇa-; both senses are possible here, also in vs. 9 below.

The position of yéna in this subordinate clause is anomalous, as we expect at most one constituent to precede the yá- form. I have no explanation, but there is much that is off-kilter in the deployment of sentence parts in this hymn.

I’ve tr. the participle tuján as it were a finite verb, because the English otherwise dribbles off into unintelligibility. In fact, because of the rel. cl. in c, it’s better to take d as a new cl. with tuján as predicated participle (“Gaining mastery, he was thrusting …”). On this stem see comm. ad IX.91.4.

The unclear kiyedhā́- is found only here and in vs. 12. See EWA s.v. and Scar’s (250-52) discussions of previous attempts at explanation. I favor the suggestion registered (and dismissed) by Scar that it consists of the weak stem of kíyant-‘how much, how great’ + the root noun dhā́-, with the development *-nt̥-dh- >

*-adzdh- > *-azdh- > -edh-, despite Hoffmann’s dismissal of the posited
phonological development (Aufs. 400)—although I recognize the phonological problems of this solution. Re’s “lui qui confère (on ne sait) combien” represents this etymology one way or the other.
