prāśavyā̀n has been subject to various analyses. Sāy suggests ‘nourishment’, which is tentatively accepted by Re. Ge tr. “die für die Pünktlichen bestimmten (Belohnungen)” without comment, leaving it unclear (at least to me) even what root he assigns it to. With Old (also EWA s.v. ŚĀVI , Hoffmann apud Gotō 304 n. 723, Scar 539-40), I take it to the root √śū ‘swell’ and connect it to the root noun cmpd prāśū́- in the following hymn (though attributed to a different poet), VIII.32.16. (Contra Re explicitly.) In both passages the lexeme seems to have a negative connotation, ‘swollen (with pride), puffed up’. Here the sacrificing married couple successfully ‘go up against’ (práti √i), that is, compete with, these puffed-up rivals. The passage reminds us of the Agastya and Lopāmudrā hymn, I.179.3 … víśvā spṛ́dho abhy àśnavāva / … yát samyáñcā mithunā́v abhyájāva “Let us two take on all contenders … when as a united couple we will drive on,” depicting another sacrificing pair competing with rivals. Our vs. and I.179.3 contain the only two masc.

du. samyáñcā in the RV. The triumph over hostile rivals is also expressed in the parallel section of this hymn (vss. 1-4) in 3c víśvā vanvánn amitríyā “winning all (the things) of the enemy.”
