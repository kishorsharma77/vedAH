rárāṇaḥ in b is clearly the middle part. to √rā ‘give’. This form appears frequently in this metrical position with just that meaning (e.g., in the preceding hymn IV.1.5c). However, given the 2nd sg. subj. jújoṣaḥ ‘you will enjoy’ at the end of the preceding pāda, I think it likely that there is a secondary association with the near synonym √ran ‘enjoy, take pleasure’ and that rárāṇaḥ could be loosely interpr. also as a 2nd sg. pf. subj. with irregularly strengthened root syllable and wrong accent (contrasting with the properly formed pf. subj. rāráṇas, -at, etc.).

Ge unaccountably interprets hótrā in c as the Goddess of the Offering found in the Āprī hymns rather than as a common noun meaning ‘offering’, an interpr. that severs c from the rest of the verse.

Pāda d is a clear relative clause (yásya), though both Ge and Re render it as an independent clause. Their tactic is understandable because pāda c, the only main cl.

in the vs., has no overt antecedent for the rel. prn. in d. We must supply a ‘his’ with hótrā to produce the connection between c and d.

The identity of “we strengtheners” is a bit puzzling. The stem vṛdhágenerally refers to a god or gods who strengthen their worshipers. In X.147.3 it is used of sūrí-s, human ‘patrons’, but patrons should not be the 1st ps. speakers in Rigvedic discourse -- rather it should be those who receive their patronage, i.e., the poets. I assume here it must refer to the group of ritual officiants, including the poet himself, and the person they are strengthening is the Yajamāna (or what will become the Yajamāna in later Vedic ritual).
