The root affiliation of iṣema is not entirely clear. Lub puts it with √iṣ ‘send’, but the case frame is wrong. But an affiliation with √iṣ ‘desire’ is even less likely. With Ge and Re I take it as meaning ‘hasten’ or the like and note the connection of the pāda, stómair iṣemāgnáye, with VIII.43.11c stómair vidhemāgnáye in the immediately preceding hymn, with iṣema a near-rhyme with vidhema in an otherwise identical pāda. Re suggests that the form and the syntactic construction have been borrowed from VIII.43.11, but doesn’t explain what verb we’re starting with (though I surmise ‘send’). So perhaps substituting for “we would send praises to Agni.”
