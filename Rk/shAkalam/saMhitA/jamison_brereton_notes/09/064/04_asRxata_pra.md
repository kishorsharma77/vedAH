In addition to the link to vs. 3 just mentioned, pāda c contains a clever echo of 2a.

That earlier pāda ends with the neut. s-stem śávaḥ ‘strength’; 4c ends vīrayā́śávaḥ, to be analyzed as two words vīrayā́āśávaḥ “with a yen for heroes the swift ones,” the latter being the nom. pl. m. of the adj. āśú-. But the final + initial vowels have entirely coalesced, and given the accentuation of both words and the underlying long final vowel of the first word, they could have been split vīrayā́*śávaḥ with the latter entirely matching the independent sstem form in 2a.
