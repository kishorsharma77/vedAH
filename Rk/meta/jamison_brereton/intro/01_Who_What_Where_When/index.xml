      <description>The R̥gveda is the oldest Sanskrit text, composed in an archaic form of the language, known as Vedic or Vedic Sanskrit. It is a collection of over a thousand poems, composed by a number of different poets over the course of some consid erable period of time. The poems are primarily hymns praising various gods and ritual elements and procedures, designed to be recited during ritual performance; that is, they are liturgical compositions.</description>

      <description>As was mentioned above, the R̥gveda is part of the long tradition of Indo-European praise poetry, composed and performed orally and deploying inherited set verbal formulae, on which the poets also ring changes. Thus, whatever date(s) we assign to the actual composition of the particular hymns found in the text, the temporal horizon of the R̥gveda stretches a good deal further back, in that the poetic techniques and even some of its precise verbal realizations go back many centuries, even millennia.</description>

      <description>The overwhelming majority of R̥gvedic hymns have as their major aim to praise the god(s) to whom the hymn is dedicated and to induce said god(s) to repay the praise with requested favors. To a certain extent different gods receive different types of praise, but the praise generally focuses on the appearance, qualities, and power of the gods and on their remarkable deeds. Some divinities attract particular attention to their appearance: for instance, the seductive beauty of Dawn, the glittering ostentation of the Maruts, the endlessly fascinating transformations of physical fire and its divine embodiment Agni.</description>

      <description>Who is the poet, and why is he composing poetry? The poets participate in an elaborate patronage system. They are hirelings, but of a very superior sort. As craftsmen of the word, their contribution to the success of the sacrifice that establishes and maintains the mutually beneficial relationship between men and gods is critical, and they serve the patrons, often royal patrons (whatever “royal” meant at this period), who arrange for and underwrite the sacrifice.</description>

      <description>The R̥gveda comprises 1028 sūktas or hymns, which contain a total of slightly more than 10,500 verses and which are divided into ten maṇḍalas, or books, of uneven size. Within each maṇḍala there is a further division of the hymns into anuvākas or “recitations” consisting of several hymns. The number of hymns in an anuvāka varies within a maṇḍala, and the number of anuvākas in each maṇḍala varies from maṇḍala to maṇḍala.</description>
