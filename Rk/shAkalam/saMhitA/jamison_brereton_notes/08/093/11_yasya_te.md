The implicitly conjoined nouns ādíś- (‘aim, intention’) and svarā́jya- (‘sovereignty, self-rule’) do not seem to me to form a natural class. It is possible that the rendering of the former should be adjusted, to harmonize with the finite verb in 15b. The Pp. analyzes that verb as simply adiṣṭa without preverb, but in its sandhi situation it could also reflect ā́-(a)diṣṭa, with the same lexeme as here. Even so, the middle voice of that verb would separate its semantics from the standard active idiom ā́√diś ‘point to, aim at’.
