Note the unusual geminate in nánnamīti, dissimilated from *námnamīti.

In pāda b the question is whether the scene is set during the thunderstorm, with frightened quivering livestock, or afterwards, as they gambol in new growth.

Pāda a speaks for the former, c for the latter. Ge (and, it seems, WG) opt for the latter, while I favor the former, though without strong grounds.

The first three pādas of this vs. begin with yásya; the fourth does not, but ends with a close phonological match, yacha.
