The instr. pl.s nā́mabhiḥ and rūpébhiḥ identically positioned in pādas a and b seem both to refer to individuated Maruts and also to make reference to the concept later to be called nāmarūpa ‘name and form’ referring to the pairing of words and things differentiating the separate entities of creation. This unusual distinguishing of individual Maruts is then countered by the insistent repetition of víśve ‘all’ referring to them as an undifferentiated class in pāda d. In that pāda I take the first víśve as voc. pl. with marutaḥ (accented because pāda-initial) and the 2nd as a nom. with the verb, but this grammatical separation may not be nec. if the two víśve-s are there to match ‘names’ and ‘forms’ respectively. Viśve Marutaḥ also semi-equates them with the Viśve Devāḥ.
