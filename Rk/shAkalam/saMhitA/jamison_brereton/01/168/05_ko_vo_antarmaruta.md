O you Maruts with lightning as your spears, who is the one among  you who sets (the fixed places) to quivering by your own breath, like  someone with his tongue quivering between his jaws?
(You) who stir up the wastelands on your journey as if stirring
refreshments [=rain], who propel many, like Etaśa [=Sun’s horse] on  his daily round.
