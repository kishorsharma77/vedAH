The construction involving the normally causal particle hí and the imperative is a troubling one. Brereton (2012 Bronkhorst Fs.) plausibly argues that in cases like this, with two imperative clauses in sequence, the hí clause expresses the action necessary for the second one to take place. In other words, the usual causal value of hí is found there as well, though the addition of imperative modality makes it difficult to render in English.
