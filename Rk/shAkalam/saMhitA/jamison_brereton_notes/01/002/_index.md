Vāyu, etc. (Praügaśastra)

The recipients of the various tṛcas making up these two rather simple hymns are clearly signalled. All three verses making up the first tṛca to Vāyu (vss. 1-3) open with a voc. vāyo; the second tṛca (to Indra and Vāyu, vss. 4-6) opens with the voc. índravāyū, while the next two begin with the famous “Vāyav Indraś ca” construction (on which see Jamison 1988). The pattern is varied in the Mitra and Varuṇa tṛca (7- 9), with the conjoined accusatives mitrám and váruṇaṃ ca opening the first and second pādas of vs. 7, and the dual dvandva mitrā́váruṇā(v) in second position in the next two verses, first as a vocative, then as a nominative.

There appears to be some attempt to create bridges between the tṛcas: verses 3 and 4 both sketch a reversal of the usual ritual model; vss. 6 and 7 both concern our ‘insight’ (dhī́).
