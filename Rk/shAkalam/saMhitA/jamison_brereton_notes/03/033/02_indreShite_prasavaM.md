índreṣite echoes víṣite in 1b, though they belong to two different roots: √iṣ ‘impel’ and √sā ‘tie’ respectively. The basis for calling the rivers índreṣite is given in 6ab.

In c ūrmíbhiḥ can be construed with both participles, samārāṇé ‘clashing together’ and pínvamāne ‘swelling’, between which it is positioned.

Although by my rule (“Vedic anyá- ‘another, the other' …”; Fs. Beekes 1997, 111-18), forms of anyá- found initial in the pāda should be indefinite (‘another’) not definite as here, the anyó‘nyam (“the one … the other”) construction works differently.
