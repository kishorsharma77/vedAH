Ge’s tr. with added “(fand)” (see also his n. and Hoffmann 1967:137) implies that this is a reference to the beginning of the Vala myth, in which the cows are stolen and leave no traces, so that Indra must find them before he gives them away. This interpretation makes sense of the otherwise opaque ṛté cid … padébhyaḥ, but it seems to require a lot of added machinery. I do not have an alternative interpretation, however.
