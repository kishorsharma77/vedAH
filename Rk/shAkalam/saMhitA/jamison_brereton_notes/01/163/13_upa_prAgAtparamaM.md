I don’t understand the point and syntactic status of the (pseudo-)izafe construction paramám yát sadhástham, and I therefore left out the yád in the publ. tr.

It may simply be a relative clause “what is his highest seat” with the main verb fronted around it.

I take júṣṭatamo hí as a parenthetical explanatory clause, which would account for the unusual position of the hí.
