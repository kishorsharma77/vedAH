The gen. phrase daívyasya dhā́mnaḥ does not have a clear syntactic relationship to the rest of its clause. The standard interpr. (Ge, Re, Scar [62]) resupplies the word gaṇá- in the rel. clause and seems to take the phrase as gen. of material, as it were: e.g., Ge “die starke (Truppe) der göttlischen Rasse.” By contrast I treat the possessive adj. túviṣmant- as a real possessive with the gen. phrase implicitly dependent on the underlying nominal tuví(s)-/*távis-, hence “having the power of its divine nature.” The utá beginning the 2nd hemistich is relatively functionless. Klein (DGRV I.375-78) says it signals weak nexus between distichs with non-parallel structure. It might also be possible to claim that it is a sort of inverse utá, which should connect c with d, which are syntactically and thematically parallel. I also think it possible that it expresses a covert conceptual connection between the heaven indirectly referred to in b (daívya-) and the midspace defined by the two world-halves in c, a space also indirectly measured by the distance from ‘chaos, disorder’ (nírṛti-) and the heavenly vault (nā́ka-) in d.
