If my comment immed. above is correct, this vs. is a fine example of it. To begin with the surface, the first hemistich has a dual voc. (párjanyavātā) and a dual impv. (jinvatam). So far all is well. But the 2nd hemistich has a plural voc. (sátyaśrutaḥ kavayaḥ), whose referents are not identified, and a singular voc. (jágata sthātar), whose referent is not identified, flanking a rel. prn. in the gen. and an instr.

pl. (yásya gīrbhíḥ), with the rest of the vs., following the singular voc., containing an apparent main cl. verb in the 2nd pl. (ā́kṛṇudhvam [so Pp.]). The simplest thing to do is to disjoin the two half-verses, keeping the dual and plural parts separate. But that leaves us with an incomplete rel. cl. that has nothing to do. The problems are discussed at length by Old, though he does not come to a firm determination.

Both Ge and Re take the first hemistich as independent, as do Old and Scar (556). By contrast, I consider it the main cl. on which cd is dependent. Since my interpr. of ab resembles theirs almost to the end, however, we are in happy agreement so far. For the connection of Parjanya and Vāta with the púrīṣāni … ápyāni “watery outpourings,” cf. X.65.9 parjányāvā́tā vṛṣabhā́purīṣínā. The only question is whether pṛthivyā́ḥ in our passage depends on vṛṣabhā or the watery outpourings: its accent (as opposed to unaccented voc. vṛṣabhā) speaks (weakly: see Old comm.) for the latter, the pāda break for the former, and the consensus is for the former. I’m not at all sure it matters.

In my interpr. of ab as the main cl. to cd, I supply a beneficial dat. “for him,” referring to the human poet, to serve as main cl. referent for the rel. yásya in c. As just noted, the standard interpr. take ab as an independent cl., and therefore must account for the rel. prn. yásya in a different way. Before tackling that, let us first determine who the vocc. in cd refer to.

The pl. voc. phrase sátyaśrutaḥ kavayaḥ beginning pāda c: by almost universal agreement, beg. with Sāy., this refers to the Maruts, on the basis of the pāda-spanning voc. phrase sátyaśrutaḥ kávayaḥ yúvānaḥ used of the Maruts in V.57.8, the only other occurrences of satya-śrut-. (It is worth remarking here that, though in both V.57.8 and here the pāda opens with the first two vocc., in V.57.8 kávayaḥ is accented, whereas here it is not. I have no explan.) The identification with the Maruts seems reasonable, though of course nothing about the phrase uniquely identifies the Maruts. However, note that in vs. 11 below they are addressed as yuvānaḥ kavayaḥ, with two of the terms found in V.57.8.

As for jágata sthātar in d, most tr. leave the referent unidentified (e.g., Ge n.

6cd “Wer der jágataḥ sthātar sein soll, ist nicht deutlich.”). Since the agent noun sthā́tar- in the sg. is otherwise used only of Indra, he seems a likely referent, esp.

because he is also regularly associated with the Maruts. The added wrinkle is that there must be a pun here as well: the stem sthātár- (so accented) ‘the still’, always in the form sthātúḥ, is the regular formulaic partner of jágat- ‘the moving’; cf., e.g., in the next hymn, VI.50.7 víśvasya sthātúr jágataḥ. The poet’s urge to make this play on words may have contributed both to the contorted syntax and the unclarity of reference we’re trying to untangle.

The two referents of the vocative phrases, the Maruts and (if I’m right) Indra, are the joint 2nd pl. subjects of the verb in d. On this, I think, we are all agreed. But all standard interpr. follow the Pp. in taking ā̇́kṛnudhvam as an unaccented, and therefore main clause, verb. (See, explicitly, Old “… ist offenbar Imperativ und hat Hauptsatzakzent.”) Under this interpr., something else has to be done with the yásya gīrbhíḥ of c. Most people supply material like mad: Ge adds a “towards him” in his main cl. and “you take pleasure” as verb in the rel. cl.: “machet alles was lebt, (dem) geneigt, an dessen Loblied (ihr Freude habt)” -- in other words, he manufactures most of the relative cl.; Scar similar, though he gives a wide choice of ways to fill out the rel. cl., thus demonstrating exactly how untethered this interpr. is: “durch dessen Lieder{ihr das könnt/ihr so heiss/ihr gepriesen werdet} (?).” Re, by contrast, eliminates the rel. cl. by folding it into a voc.: “(toi) par les paroles de qui (les chose se réalisent)” -- though it still requires extensive material to fill it out, again based on nothing.

My solution is to take ā́kṛṇudhvam as the verb of the rel. cl.: the Saṃhitā text of course reads ā́kṛṇudhvam; it is only the Pp. that inserts a notional word space after ā́. If we instead interpr. the sequence as an augmented imperfect, with accent on the augment, that is, ā + ákṛṇudhvam (which does not require emendation), we do not have to fill out the rel. cl., because it already has an accented verb and that verb has an object: “you made the moving world your own.” This expression, ā́√kṛ (middle)

+ INSTR. has close parallels, one containing gīrbhíḥ as here: cf. I.77.2 tám ū námobhir ā́krṇ̥ udhvam / X.6.5 agníṃ gīrbhír námobhir ā́krṇ̥ udhvam. In both those passages I tr. “attract here with reverence (and hymns).” The difference in interpr. may be ascribed to the fact that in our passage here, the gods are subj. and the hymns come from the human poet, whereas in the two passages just cited mortals are also the subj.

However, I may want to rethink both of those passages, to “make him [/Agni] your own.” Since in both passages Agni is the object, he does not have to be attracted here, since as the ritual fire he already is here.

Thus, by my interpr. all of cd is a rel. cl., dependent on a “for him” or the like to be supplied in the main cl. of ab. Note that both Ge. (“dem”) and Scar. (“für ihn”) must supply the same beneficial dative, but they do so with the supposed main cl.

verb ā́kṛṇudhvam in d. Although my interpr. produces an awk English tr., it accounts for the Sanskrit considerably better than the alternatives. What it means for the gods to “make the moving world their own” I’m not sure -- but perhaps the usual RVic notion that human praises strengthen the gods for their heroic deeds and, perhaps in this case, that these praises bring the gods and their human worshipers (part of the “moving world”) into a closer relationship.
