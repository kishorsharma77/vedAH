But as the day dawns, the frogs become visible, with their drive to mate overriding any instinct to flee or conceal themselves. This visibility is insistently conveyed by “[they] become visible; none are hidden” (āvír bhavanti gúhyā ná ké cit).

The frogs are compared to two different kinds of priests: brahmins (7a, 8a), who are here responsible for ritual speech, and Adhvaryus (8c), the priests who do the physical labor in Vedic ritual. They are “sweating” (siṣvidānā́ḥ): sweat is a sign of hard ritual labor in Indo-Iranian religious terminology (see my 2011 [2015] “Avestan xšuuīd: A Relic of Indo-Iranian Ritual Vocabulary,” Bulletin of the Asia Institute 25: 19-29). Here, once again the image does double duty -- the frogs would be covered with water drops from the rains, but they are also compared to the hard-working priests officiating at the Pravargya ritual. The Pravargya is an especially sweatinducing ritual, since it involves a hot milk drink (gharmá-), which must be tended as it is heated over the fire. Other features of the Pravargya conform to aspects of the hymn: there is a year-long dīkṣā (period of consecration for the sacrificer), reflected 137 in both 1a (saṃvatsaráṃ śaśayānā́ḥ “lying for a year”) and 8b (bráhma kṛṇvántaḥ parivatsarī́ṇam “creating their yearly sacred formulation”); this dīkṣā involves a taboo on water or moisture of any kind. But the most crucial intersection between the Pravargya and frog behavior is found in the next vs. Note in passing the non-etym. figure vā́cam akrata bráhma kṛṇvántaḥ with two forms of √kṛ governing two words for speech, with the subject, brāhmaṇā́saḥ in a derivational relationship to the 2nd form of speech.
