Ge supplies a second, accusative, form of ā́yudha- as object of viveṣa and supplies “enemies” as the referent of eṣām ‘of them’, while making the accusative phrase in b the object of vidvā́n ‘knowing’: “Der Fürchtbare hat mit den Waffen ihre (Waffen) abgetan, der aller mannhaften Werke kundig ist.” But there are several reasons to reject this interpretation in addition to the necessity of supplying a significant word. The root √viṣ ‘labor, bring to fulfillment’ does not mean ‘abtun’ (dismiss, brush aside). Moreover it regularly takes ápas- ‘work’, a form of which appears in pāda b, as object; see esp. IV.19.10 ápāṃsi ... náryā́viveṣīḥ. By contrast, the participle vidvā́n is usually used absolutely, without object. As for the referent of eṣām it would of course possible to supply “enemies,” although they are not mentioned previously in the hymn: the only preceding masc. or neut. plurals are the pressing stones (subject of the whole of vs. 2), the “finely made (fortifications)” of 3d, and, in a simile, the charioteers in 3c. Because the pressing stones are extravagantly celebrated in vs. 2 and called Indra’s “companions,” I think it likely that they are the referents here: the soma they produce is their weapon, and this soma fuels Indra’s labors. This is also Caland-Henry’s solution (L’Agniṣṭoma, p. 285 and n.

3).

I supply “fortifications” (púraḥ) from c as the obj. of jaghāna in d. It is possible that we are meant to think instead (or in addition) of the archetypal obj. of this verb, the serpent Vṛtra, who is concealed in the instr. (m)ahi(nā́) directly before the verb. Cf. áhinā in 3b.

The first word of the verse, bhīmáḥ, picks up the last word of vs. 3, bhīṣā́.
