Indra  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
This brief “journey” hymn signals its application to the Midday Pressing by the  adjective “accompanied by the Maruts” ending the first half-verse; the usual men tion of Indra’s horses in journey hymns is also found. In addition to the refrain (vs.  5), verse 4 is also a repetition, of the near final verse of the first Indra hymn in this  maṇḍala (III.30.20). Since III.50 is the final hymn in the regular sequence of Indra  hymns in III (III.51 is a collection of tr̥cas in various meters; III.52–53 are similarly  various), the double repetition seems to act as a ring-compositional device to mark  the end of the Indra cycle.
