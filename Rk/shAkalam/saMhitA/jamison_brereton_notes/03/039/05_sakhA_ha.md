The interweaving of lexicon and morphology continues in this vs. Pāda a contains two forms of the same stem: sákhā … sákhibhiḥ, and the instr. pl. is found four more times in the vs. (adjacent návagvaiḥ, b sátvabhiḥ, c daśábhir dáśagvaiḥ the last pair with their own etymological play). Pāda-final dáśagvaiḥ also parallels návagvaiḥ ending pāda a, and sátvabhiḥ of b is more subtly connected with satyám beginning c.
