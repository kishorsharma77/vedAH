Ādityas  
Trita Āptya  
18 verses: mahāpaṅkti  
The first two-thirds of this hymn (through vs. 12) beg the Ādityas for general help  and protection from generic evils—the nonspecific nature of what is requested  underlined by the rather redundantly phrased refrain. The refrain continues through  the last third of the hymn (vss. 13–18), but in the non-refrain portions the focus nar  
rows—to the elimination of the “bad dream,” which is sent far away to the shadowy  figure called Trita Āptya. Nothing else in the scraps of mythology we know about  Trita Āptya explains why he should be the scapegoated recipient of our nightmares,  much less why he would make them into body ornaments (vs. 15) or use them as  food and work (vs. 16). The agent who removes the bad dream to Trita is Dawn (vss.  14–16, 18), whose participation is easier to understand—as anyone knows who has  experienced the relief of waking in the morning to discover that the nightmares just  experienced were not real.
