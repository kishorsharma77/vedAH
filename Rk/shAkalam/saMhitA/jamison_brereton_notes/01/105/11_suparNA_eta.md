I am completely baffled about what this verse actually describes, although an astronomical reference is very likely. The many clashing interpretations of the verse do not inspire confidence in any of them. I will simply point out that we seem invited to identify the suparṇā́ḥ here with the ukṣáṇaḥ of 10a on the basis of the repetition of the phrase mádhye (…) diváḥ and the semantic match between tasthúḥ “they stand” (10b) and āsate “they sit” (11a), though the sg. suparṇáḥ in vs. 1 should also be recalled.
