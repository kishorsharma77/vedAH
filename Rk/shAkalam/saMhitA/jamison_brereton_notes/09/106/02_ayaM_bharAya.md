Both Ge and Re take jaítrasya as a noun ‘victory’, but with Gr I supply Indra as the referent for this vṛddhi adj. This would provide a thematic reciprocity between vss. 1 and 2: in 1 the soma drops are born because of Indra’s attentive hearing (in my interpr.), while here Soma repays Indra’s attention with his own.
