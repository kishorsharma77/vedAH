This verse as it stands poses a number of problems, but some of them disappear if, following Ge’s earlier Komm., adopted also by Old, and reflected in Ge’s tr., the sequence yánn áyaḥ (per Pp.) is read yán náyaḥ, which requires no change in the Saṃhitā text. This produces a subordinating conjunction (yád out of sandhi), which in turn accounts for the accented verb (náyaḥ) and allows the whole verse to be read as a single dependent clause (in my interpretation: Ge supplies the verb “… hast du … erhört” for pādas ab, while Old suggests rather “du hast … gesegnet”). Although my interpretation has the yád uncomfortably late in its clause, after two heavy constituents (violating Hale’s old observation that only one constituent can precede the yá-form), it avoids supplying a verb out of nowhere for the first part of the verse, and I take the acc. phrase of ab as an almost extrasentential topicalized NP, so positioned to get the name and attributes of the poet up front.

With Old and Ge I take abhí with náyaḥ, but unlike them don’t supply ‘heaven’ as the goal (on the basis of AV XII.3.16, 17). In the RV the lexeme abhí √nī can take as goal vásu ‘goods’ (VI.53.2) or vásyaḥ ‘better state’ (VI.61.14, I.31.18), and since this verse inaugurates the dānastuti, goods would be at issue.

As noted in the intro., there are various tales or tale fragments in Vedic prose (see esp. JB III.233-35. also ŚB III.3.4.18) linking Indra as ram and Medhātithi, but to my mind they are later and not particularly successful rationalizations of this obscure verse.
