Here again the standard tr. supply ‘speech’ as obj. of the chained iyarti, as is very probable, but make diváḥ dependent on this gapped obj. (e.g., Ge “(die Stimme) des Himmels”); again I construe diváḥ elsewhere, here with rájaḥ ‘realm’. For the phrase cf. divó rájaḥ I.62.5, 110.6. The further point here is that the ritual speech inspired by Soma is impelled all the way to heaven.

The VP várivo vidat “finds wide space” (d) responds in sense (and partially etymologically) to urú jráyaḥ “wide expanse” in 2c.
