On mahā́m as acc. sg. masc. see AiG III.251, EWA s.v. mahā́nt, p. 338.

The paradox of calling fire “a great watering trough” (āhāvá-) simply sharpens the slightly discordant image in 1c of Agni as ‘cup’. Although āhāvá- is clearly derived from ā́√hu, a standard lexeme for the oblations that Agni would be receiving, this particular noun is associated with a well in X.101.5 and is therefore associated with more mundane acts of pouring water (which of course should extinguish fire). Agni is a trough because the gods get their “water” there.
