The Pp. interprets sutapā́as sutapā́ḥ, hence a nom. sg., and this interpr. is accepted by Re and WG. However, Ge argues persuasively for du. sutapā́, and I follow him. The others must invent a mysterious soma-drinker who gives wide space and freedom to Viṣṇu and Indra; as indicated in the publ. intro. I assume that the clash (samáraṇam) in pāda a is what opens up the space.

The stem uruṣyá-, the verb ending both b and d, must be read in two different senses (as recognized by all tr.); ‘go wide’ is a useful English idiom for an arrow or other missile missing its target.
