The adj. somínaḥ can of course be either abl.-gen. sg. or nom.-acc. pl. It shares a pāda with acc. vyàśvān, so proximity favors taking it with that noun - as in the publ. tr. (also Ge). However, Sāy. takes it with gen. nāryásya in the previous pāda, and he may be correct. Nārya appears to be the (or one) name of the patron of the sacrifice, the dispenser of the dakṣiṇā to the poets, and it would make sense to refer to him as possessing or providing soma. I would therefore entertain the alternative tr.

“ let the priestly gift of Nārya, provider of soma, come to the Vyaśvas.”
