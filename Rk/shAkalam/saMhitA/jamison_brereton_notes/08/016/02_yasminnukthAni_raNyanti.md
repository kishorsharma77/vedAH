The simile in c, apā́m ávo ná samudré, is hard to interpret. “The sea” corresponds to Indra in the frame and “the aid of the waters” should correspond to recitations and famous deeds, but what is the aid of the waters? Ge suggests in passing a possible connection with avániḥ ‘stream(bed)’, but this seems based only on superficial phonological similarity, and in the end he tr. “die Gunst der Gewässer” and hopes for the best. Old suggests an emendation to apā́m *ápaḥ ‘work of the waters’, but it is hard to see how a nice alliterative phrase like that would become corrupted, and so, like Ge, I stick to the text transmitted and the common word ávasthat it seems to contain. Perhaps the point is that, like recitations that find their joy in contributing to Indra's power, the waters take pleasure in submerging themselves in the sea, “aiding” the sea by making it bigger.
