The preverb sám ‘together’ in sám eti may seem an odd choice in a verse concerning cutting the horse apart. However, it sets up a contrastive pairing with ví śasta ‘cut apart / carve up’ at the end of the 2nd hemistich, and it also anticipates (or promises) the rejoining of the parts of the horse that ends the hymn.

As it turns out, horses have 36 ribs, not 34. Max Müller noted this in 1875 and got a potential explanation from T. H. Huxley -- that it may be that they’re cutting the rib cartilage and they don’t cut the last two ribs in order to keep the carcass together: [http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Popular_Science_Monthly/Volume_7/June_1875/A_C urious_Question_of_Horses'_Ribs]
