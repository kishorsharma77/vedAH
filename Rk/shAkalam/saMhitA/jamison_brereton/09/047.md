Soma Pavamāna
Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: gāyatrī
The next three hymns (IX.47–49) are attributed to Kavi Bhārgava, to whom the  Anukramaṇī also credits the five Jagatī hymns IX.75–79. The Soma of this hymn is  distinctly militant, using the power he has acquired (vs. 1) to destroy the Dasyus (vs.  2) and win spoils, as Indra’s very mace (vss. 3, 5). But the same Soma is both a poet  (vs. 4) and a recipient of poetry (vs. 3), who facilitates the human poet’s acquisition  of treasure from his patron (vs. 4).
## 1
Through this good ritual performance Soma has waxed strong even over  the great ones.
Becoming exhilarated, he up and acts the bull.
## 2
His deeds done and to be done, crushing the Dasyus, are conspicuous, and the bold one exacts recompense for debts.
## 3
Then Soma, the sap destined for Indra, becomes a mace winning
thousands,
when a hymn is born for him.
## 4
Himself a sage poet, he seeks a treasure for the inspired poet at (the  hands of) the distributor,
as he keeps grooming his insightful thoughts.
## 5
Desirous of winning riches, as of winning chargers at prize-contests, you are among those who are victorious in the raids.1274 IX. 48–49
