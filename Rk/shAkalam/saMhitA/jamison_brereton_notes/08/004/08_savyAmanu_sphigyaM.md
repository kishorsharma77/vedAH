Pāda a contains one of the two occurrences of sphigī́- ‘hip’ in the RV (and in fact anywhere). The other is in III.32.11 in a thematically similar passage, yád anyáyā sphigyā̀kṣā́m ávasthāḥ “… when you wore the earth on the other hip.” (See comm. there.) It is difficult not to assume that the same situation is being depicted in this passage, and I therefore supply ‘earth’ here as well, esp. since a tr. without an object makes little sense (e.g., Ge’s “Der Bulle deckte seine linke Seite,” without further interpretation). In III.32.11 the image serves to give a comparison by which to measure Indra’s vast size (the preceding pāda says “Heaven did not come close to your greatness then”). Despite the truncated expression in our passage, I think the same comparative impulse applies: Indra is so big that the whole earth fits on one of his hips.

Pāda b is then thematically contrastive, though in a very indirect way. Even though he is so vast and, by implication, too important to concern himself with the likes of us, he gives freely and without feeling peevish towards the petty recipients of his largesse. This sets the stage for our invitation to him in cd, describing the soma mixed with milk (or rather, the reverse in this case: the milk mixed with the honey[ed soma]) and then urging him to come.
