Although this hymn of the twinset of VIII.36-37 is the domain of the kṣatrā́ni ‘lordly powers’, it begins with the bráhman- that ended the last hymn and provided its key word, also echoing that verse in other ways (āvitha, sunvatáḥ).

Ge takes sunvatáḥ as acc. pl., but given the connections between the two hymns and the fact that sunvatáh in VIII.36 is gen. sg. in both the first and last verses of VIII.36, I find this unlikely.

There are some difficulties in distributing the words in the refrain pādas.

Given its regular recurrence, sacīpate ‘o lord of power’ should be the first word of the refrain, but given its lack of accent it must be the last word of the non-refrain pādas. Nonetheless I have tr. it with the refrain. Also problematic is unaccented anedya, which comes at the end of a pāda already twelve syllables long and should therefore not belong to it. Old discusses but doesn’t really solve.
