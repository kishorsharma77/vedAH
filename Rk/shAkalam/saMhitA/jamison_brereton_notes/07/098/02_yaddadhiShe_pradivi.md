With Ge I take yád as a neut. rel. prn. rather than as the subordinating conj.

yád, though this poses some minor syntactic difficulties. If the referent is ultimately soma, we would expect a masc. form (yám); the neut. can be explained as “attraction” to the predicated “food” (neut. ánnam) in the same cl. (“what you made your food …”). As a resumptive pronoun in the main cl. we might also prefer *tásya to asya, though this is a small problem.
