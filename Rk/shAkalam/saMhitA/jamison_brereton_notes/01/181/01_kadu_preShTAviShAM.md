The 2nd du (un)ninītháḥ, with primary ending, is formally problematic. It is tentatively assigned to a redupl. pres. by Whitney, but there is otherwise no evidence for such a pres., while the pf. is well established. Macdonell (oddly) calls it a pf.

subjunctive, but the mood sign of the subjunctive is absent. It can’t be an example of simple avoidance of a paradigmatically shaky form, as in the case of *avṛṇāthām in the preceding hymn (I.180.4), because the expected pf. indic. ninyathuḥ is actually attested, with the same preverb (úd) and the Aśvins also as subject (I.116.8, 24). Kü suggests (280-81) that the form is aiming to be an injunctive (that is, I assume, an unaugmented pluperfect) meant to be distinguished from a putative imperative

*ninītám with 2ndary ending, and therefore it takes a primary ending (a solution
endorsed by WG). This seems needlessly complex and, pace Hoffmann (Injunc., 111), I find the notion that an injunctive would adopt primary endings for this purpose somewhat bizarre, since secondary endings are what define the injunctive. A simpler solution is to assume the form is a nonce present generated to ambiguous perfect forms like opt. ninīyāt (2x).

How to construe the genitives iṣā́ṃ rayīṇā́m and apā́m is another problem. I take them as parallel partitive genitives, roughly flg. Old, rather than taking the former pair as dependent on préṣṭḥau and the latter as a pseudo-ablative as Ge does.
