Kü (239), WG take mánma as the subj. of dadabhanta (Kü: “Den Spender werden wirklich nicht schädigen die Gedichte”). This avoids having to invent an unidentified set of beings inimical to Agni, but raises the question of why anyone would think that mánma, which are generally benign and positively related to the ritual, would harm Agni. (See, e.g., the mánma in I.151.6-8, also a Dīrghatamas hymn.) I don’t think it’s a question of “sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me” -- a very non-Vedic sentiment.
