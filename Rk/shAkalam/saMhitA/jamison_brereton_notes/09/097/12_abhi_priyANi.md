The first pāda is alliterative: … priyā́ṇi pavate punānáḥ, while opening of the 2nd is an etymological figure that matches the one opening 11d.

The referent of priyā́ṇi, the obj. or goal of abhí … pavate, is uncertain. In the pub. tr. I supply ‘tracks’, on the basis of 7c padā́… abhy èti, as well as IX.12.8 abhí priyā́divás padā́… arṣati “he rushes towards the dear tracks of heaven.” However, as noted above, I no longer think padā́in vs. 7 is an acc. pl., and I am also more moved by Ge’s cited parallel, IX.75.1 abhí priyā́ṇi pavate ..., nā́māni “he purifies himself towards his own dear names.” But cf. also IX.57.2 abhí priyā́ṇi kā́vyā ...

arṣati. I would now be inclined to supply ‘names’ (“he purifies himself towards his own dear names”), since Soma’s progress across the ritual ground to his names is a trope (see comm. ad IX.75.1). But since there are a number of other referential possibilities for the construction abhí priyā́(ṇi), it might be best simply to tr.

“towards his own dear (things).” Pāda c is also puzzling: the phrase “clothing himself in his foundations” (dhármāṇi … vásānaḥ) is not immediately interpretable, and there are no illuminating parallels (at least that I have found). The adverbial ṛtuthā́“according to the ritual order” suggests that the process of “clothing himself” involves following the orderly steps of the sacrifice - which in turn suggests that Soma is making his progress across the ritual ground, encountering first the waters, then the milk, before arriving at his destination. I therefore think that the “foundations” here are the waters and the milk - his supports, the materials of which the soma drink is built. But this cannot be demonstrated.
