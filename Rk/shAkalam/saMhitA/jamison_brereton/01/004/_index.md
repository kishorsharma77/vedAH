Indra
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra
10 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥cas
As Bergaigne (1889: 182) points out, the hymns I.4–9, all dedicated to Indra, all in  gāyatrī, and all attributed to the same Vaiśvāmitra poet, form the texts on which the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin priest, an assistant of the Hotar, draws for supplementary  verses at the Morning Pressing.
This particular hymn consists of three tr̥cas and a final summary verse (10);  the first and last tr̥cas are fairly conventional. In the first (vss. 1–3) the poet calls  on Indra to come to our sacrifice and consume our soma. In the last (vss. 7–9)  the poet again offers Indra soma and recounts Indra’s past deeds inspired by his  soma-drinking, with hopes for similar future exploits.
The middle tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) is a different matter and displays some anxiety about  the poet’s exclusive focus on Indra—“putting all his eggs in one basket,” in the  English idiom. In verse 4, immediately after the peremptory command to Indra,  “come here!” the poet orders himself (or another person?) to “go away!”—to seek  out Indra and inquire who he [=Indra, in our view] favors as a comrade, in an  indirect question with a curious mixture of direct and indirect syntax. The ques
tion is also rhetorical: the poet expects Indra to favor him, and in verses 5 and 6  he defends the exclusive partnership against unnamed cavilers, by asserting that  having Indra alone on his side is a good bargain. The defensive tone of this tr̥ca  may seem an odd feature of the first full hymn to Indra in the R̥gveda, but it does  strike a note that we will meet again and again in the collection—the worried hope  that Indra will indeed choose to attend our sacrifice and that he will extend his help  to us alone.
