Ge and Re interpret pāda b as having three finite verbs: śáṃsāti, yájate, and ví … dhāḥ, subjunctive, pres. indicative, and injunctive respectively. The first and third go well together (esp. if the injunctive is imperatival, as dhāḥ so often is), but the indicative does not sit well between them. By contrast Gr interprets yájate as the dat. sg. of the act. pres. part., rather than as a middle 3rd sg. With Old (SBE) and WG, I follow Gr in the morphological analysis, but both Old and WG construe the part.

with vy ū̀dhāḥ. I think it belongs rather with śáṃsati, both because of the position of the ū and because of a nearby parallel passage also in an Agni hymn, IV.16.2 śáṃsāti ukthám … cikitúṣe … “He will recite his solemn speech to the one who attends to it,” with a dat. participle in this formula. The referent of yájate is Agni; note that he is called the superior sacrificer (yájīyān) in 1b, so yájate forms a ring with that first mention.

It is not clear what obj. to supply with ví … dhāḥ ‘apportion’. It generally takes goods or the like elsewhere, hence my ‘treasures’, though I am tempted by Re’s “tu répartis (les rôles)” -- that is, Agni distributing ritual roles and ritual speech to the various participants.

“Laud of Āyu” (śáṃsam āyóḥ; also V.3.4) must refer to Agni, however odd the expression seems to be -- rather like referring to someone as “the toast of the town.” Of course, one of Agni’s standing epithets is the cmpd. nárā-śáṃsa-, of which śáṃsa- āyóḥ is simply an analytic variant.
