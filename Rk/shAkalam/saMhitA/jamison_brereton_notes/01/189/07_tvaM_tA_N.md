The ví with vidvā́n picks up the ví that both opens and closes the preceding verse (ví … yaṃsat / viṣpáṭ), linking this verse to the apparently different topic that precedes it. This provides a clue for the referent of tā́n … ubháyān “those both.” Ge (/WG) take the both to refer to the two time periods mentioned in this verse, prapitvé and abhipitvé, but, on the basis of the larger context, with Old (SBE) and Re I think it refers to good and bad men, or more narrowly to sacificers and non-sacrificers.

Agni’s eagerness for the sacrifice is expressed by pāda b, where he pursues (véṣi) the sons of Manu, i.e., the sacrificers, at the earlier mealtime, and his satisfaction as the sacrifice proceeds by the gerundive śā́syaḥ ‘to be directed/instructed, tractable’.

In b Ge (/WG) supply ‘nourishment’ (die Nahrung) as object of véṣi with mánuṣaḥ as gen. sg., but this seems unnecessary.

There is no consensus about the meaning or etymology of the word akrá- (5x), generally a descriptor of Agni; see EWA s.v. Gr glosses ‘Herrzeichen, Banner’, but since it is once called navajā́- ‘new-born’ (IV.6.3), an animal (or at least a living thing) is more likely. Since several of the contexts refer to the kindling of the fire, it seems likely to be a young animal, an identification that navajā́- of course favors.

And marmṛjénya- ‘to be groomed’ in our passage suggests a horse, since the root √mṛj generally takes a horse or something so conceived as its object. Hence the tr.

‘foal’.

Despite the position of ná, uśígbhiḥ is unlikely to form part of the simile.
