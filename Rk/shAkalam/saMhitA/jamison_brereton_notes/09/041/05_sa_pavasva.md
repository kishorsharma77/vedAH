Old takes uṣā́ḥ as acc. pl. (so also AiG III.283) and the object of ā́… pṛṇa in the simile (so presumably “as the sun [fills] the dawns with its rays”; cf Oberlies Rel.RV I.238).

Although an acc. pl. uṣā́ḥ is morphologically possible (like rare gen. sg. uṣáḥ), the simile thus produced does not make sense to me, and despite the parade of citations of supposed parallels that Old provides, no passage has anything remotely like that. I follow Ge in taking uṣā́ḥ and sū́ryaḥ as parallel nom. sg., both participating in the simile. Re seems to take as nom., but pl., for no obvious reason.
