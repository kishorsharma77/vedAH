I interpr pāda a (which is identical to IV.9.5a) as a variation on passages like X.2.2 véṣi hotrám utá potráṃ jánānām “pursue the office of Hotar and of Potar of the peoples,” but with gapping of the terms for the priestly offices.

The standard tr. take samṛdháḥ as an abstract ‘success’ (e.g., Ge “Schaff … Gelingen”; cf. also Re, Scar [67]), but the only other occurrences of this root noun, in the frog hymn VII.103.5, clearly means something like ‘unison’, referring to the frog chorus. One of the two finite forms of this lexeme, sám ānṛdhe in X.79.7, also seems to have this sense: Agni “comes together” with his parts or limbs (párvabhiḥ). The other, in X.85.27, has a sense closer to simplex √ṛdh ‘be (completely) realized, come to success’. In our passage here, the ‘unison’ interpr. makes sense, esp. in the larger context of this hymns (and also VI.1), with the focus on Agni as clanlord of the separate Ārya clans, which are nonetheless working towards a common goal. On the other hand, the appearance of simplex ṛ́dhat in this hymn (4a, on which see comm. ad loc.) and in the cmpd. ṛdhádvāra- in the next (VI.3.2) might suggest a rendering closer to the simplex here as well.
