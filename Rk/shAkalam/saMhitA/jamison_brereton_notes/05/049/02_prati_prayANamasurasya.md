The standard tr. construe vidvā́n with prayā́ṇam ásurasya (e.g., Ge “'Der Ausfahrt des Asura gewärtig,” with a slightly odd rendering of vidvā́n, perhaps because he construes it with práti?). But pāda-final vidvā́n, which is quite common, is generally used absolutely, without an object (and tmesis would be unusual, though not unprecedented, with a participle). The absolute usage would be reinforced by likewise pāda-final vijānán ‘discerning’ in c; the two participles define the subject as a sagacious and perceptive poet/sacrificer.

The referent of the acc. sg. adj. jyéṣṭham is entirely ambiguous: it can be neut.

and modify rátnam or masc. and modify vibhájantam. Since jyéṣṭha- ‘distinguished, pre-eminent’ is used of both animates and inanimates, there is no way to tell -- and the decision hardly matters. More interesting is the ca in d, which must link the phrase jyéṣṭham … rátnaṃ vibhájantam āyóḥ, which refers to Bhaga (see 1b), with a gapped Savitar, who, though present in pāda b and conjoined with Bhaga in 1ab, is not found in the clause in 2cd.
