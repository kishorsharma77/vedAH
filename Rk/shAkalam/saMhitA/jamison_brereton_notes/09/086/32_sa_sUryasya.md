Although the standard interpr. of yáthā vidé here makes Soma subj. of the verb (e.g., Ge “wie er es versteht”), pāda-final yáthā vidé is a common tag (I.127.4, 132.2, etc.) with a passive reading of the verb: “as is known, in the way that is known.” The “directives of truth” (ṛtásya praśíṣaḥ) are convincingly identified as the hymns by Lü (469-70), as the adj. návīyas-, a standard descriptor of hymns in the fem., suggests.

I assume that the “threefold thread” (tántum … trivṛtám) refers to the three soma pressings.
