The standard tr. take deváḥ as a predicate nominative (vel sim.) with dhāyi (e.g., Re “… a été installé (comme) dieu”). This may be correct, but it does assume that Bṛhaspati only secondarily came to be considered as, or was made into, a deva (so, e.g., Ge n. 2d). Following H.-P. Schmidt’s hypothesis that bṛ́haspáti- was originally an epithet of, and aspect of, Indra, it would be possible to interpret this passage as referring to the moment when Bṛhaspati emerged as a deva in his own right; on the other hand, since Indra is most definitely a deva from the beginning, a particular aspect of him should not require promotion to deva-status. It should be noted that Schmidt explicitly disputes the standard interp. (B+I, 75-77) and tr. deváḥ as a simple descriptor: “So wird der grosse, machtgeborene, mächtige B., der Stier, der Gott eingesetzt.” I follow Schmidt.
