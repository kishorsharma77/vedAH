The first word of the hymn is prá, as it was in V.52, the first of Śyāvāśva’s Marut hymns. It would at first appear to be in tmesis with anajā in b (so Gr and see Re’s bizarre tr. “je veux lancer-avec-onction”), but √añj does not otherwise appear with prá. I think it rather belongs with the last word of the vs., arcata. The syntagm prá √arc is quite common and, more to the point, began the first hymn in this cycle: V.52.1ab prá …, árcā. The rest of our vs., from śárdhāya to dyumnáśravase, is set into this celebratory frame.

anajā is the 1st sg. act. nasal infix pres. subjunctive, as all the standard tr. take it, pace its assignment to the pf. by Gr, Wh, Macd.

My tr. of gharmastúbh- ‘with the rhythm of the gharma-pot’ sounds like a bahuvrīhi, which it is not. Better would be ‘chanting rhymically (like) the gharmapot’ (cf. chandastúbh- in nearby V.52.12). The point of comparison, as is noted by most comm., is the regular bubbling of the gharma-pot.

My “sacrificing on the back of heaven” agrees with Ge and Re in taking diváḥ as limiting the first member of pṛṣṭhayájvane. Old allows both this and a syntagm divá ā́“from heaven,” while WG follow Old’s 2nd alternative and suggest that the Maruts are sacrificing on the back of the earth (to be supplied). It is difficult to make a judgment here.
