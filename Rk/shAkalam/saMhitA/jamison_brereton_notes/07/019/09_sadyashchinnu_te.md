I take pāda c with ab, since all three have 3rd ps. subjects referring to Indra’s worshipers and clients, with pāda c a rel. cl. beginning with yé. Ge, by contrast, connects c with d, although d now refers to the same people in the 1st ps.

(asmā́n vṛṇīṣva “choose us”). He does not, however, take asmā́n as coreferential with the yé of c, but rather apparently interprets the relationship between the clauses as a kind of improper relativization: “for the same alliance (yújyāya tásmai) as (those) who (yé)…” This has the advantage of providing some reason for the final tásmai, which I find hard to account for, though I find his way of linking the clauses too tricky. Scar takes the first pāda as a temporal subordinate clause (“As soon as they are in your charge, the men…”). This is worth considering, although I am dubious about the subordinating quality of sadyáś cid. In the end, although I am not entirely 18 certain of my own way of putting together the various elements in this verse, I have not been convinced by those of other tr. either.

Note the poet’s playful variation on 8a … te maghavann abhíṣṭau with … té maghavann abhíṣṭau, where the simple addition of an accent turns the 2nd ps. sg. into a 3rd ps. pl.

náraḥ śaṃsanti recalls the epithet nárāśáṃsa, and then participates in an interweaving of two words for ritual speech: śaṃsanti ukthaśāsa ukthā́.

The lexeme ví √dāś occurs only here, as far as I know. Like the idiom ā́√yaj ‘attract by sacrifice’, it combines a directional preverb with a root of ritual activity, producing a portmanteau “(send) away by perfoming ritual service’. So Old ‘hinweghuldigen’, which he paraphrases as “honor the god such that the Pāṇis become distant.” On the syntagm yújyāya √vṝ see comm. ad IX.88.1.
