My tr. of pāda b sounds in English like a loc. absol. or a relative clause, but is simply an attempt to keep the pāda together in tr. The acc. suśiprám of course simply picks up the rel. prn. yám that opens the verse.

Ge tr. ādṛ́tyā as “fürsorglich” and so must assign it to a separate root √dṛ ‘pay heed’. I instead take the form to √dṛ ‘burst, tear’ (a possibility Ge registers in his n.).

See EWA s.v. DARI for the likelihood that the later ā́√dṛ ‘pay heed’ forms developed as semantic specializations of ‘tear out’.
