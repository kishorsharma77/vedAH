Ge takes ṛtvíyāya dhā́mane as referring to the Maruts (as the “pünktlichen Geschlechten” [timely race], a phrase that doesn’t make a lot of sense to me) or Indra. On the basis of V.48.1 priyā́ya dhā́mne ... svákṣatrāya sváyavase “or the self-ruling, self-glorious one … for his own dear establishment,” I take this as referring to the establishment of Indra at the sacrifice, governed by the sacrificial order, which the singers are hoping for. This establishment is then stated as accomplished in 12c yáḥ … dhā́yi “who has been established …” ṛ́kvabhiḥ reminds us of the insistent arká of the 2nd tṛca (4c, 5c, 6c); the same verb √nu ‘cry out’ is repeated here, from 5c.
