The c pāda, víśvā dhā́māni viśvavít, has the same neut. pl. acc. NP as 2c and the third word is phonologically similar to 2c āviśán. There are in principle three ways to construe víśvā dhā́māni: 1) as a 2nd object to arocayat in a (“made the sun shine (and) all the domains”); 2) as the goal of āviśán, supplied from 2c (“entering all domains”); 3) as the object of the root noun -víd- extracted the cmpd. viśva-víd- or as further specification of the 1st member of that cmpd. (so, either “all-knowing, (knowing) the domains” as in the publ.

tr., or “knowing all, (viz.) all the domains”). Like the publ. tr., Re chooses the first version of 3), and this seems the most rhetorically satisfying, while Ge opts for a variant of the second version of 3, while being forced to the further step of interpr. dhā́māni as “forms” (“all Formen vollständig kennend”) on the basis of his interpr. of 2c.
