My interpr. of the 2nd hemistich differs in several respects from the standard.

In d I take aśvadā́(ḥ) ‘giving horses’ as acc. pl. fem. with the dawns (so also Re, Scar), not nom. sg. masc. with the soma-presser. Although the latter is possible (and aśvadā́- is elsewhere used of mortal patrons), it seems here to belong with the characterizations of the dawns in pāda a: gómatīḥ … sárvavīrā(ḥ). Note that Dawn is addressed as aśva-sūnrt̥ e ‘liberal with horses’ in V.79.1-10.

More radical is my interpr. of pāda c, which is much discussed (see elaborate notes of Old, Ge, and Re; also Scar 66-67, somewhat differently 202, 617). Most take the simile vāyór iva to refer to the surging up of gifts as swiftly as the wind; in other words the unexpressed common quality is the speed with which the gifts come.

I think rather that the hapax udarká- refers to the ‘raising’ of the litany that accompanies the distribution of the dakṣiṇās at the Morning Pressing. (Cf. udṛ́c- RV 2x “when the chant is raised.”) And this litany is compared to the one accompanying the first offering of the Morning Pressing to Vāyu. Note that personified sūnṛ̥́tā is closely associated with Vāyu in the two nearby Vāyu hymns I.134.1 and I.135.7.

That it is not the physical aspect of wind that is at issue is suggested by the use of vāyú- not vā́ta-, as Re points out.
