Pāda b provides a good example of cid taking Wackernagel’s position even though the word it should limit occurs later in the vs. line. In the first pāda cid correctly follows the word it limits, or rather the first part of the dual dvandva dyā́vā cid … pṛthivī́“even Heaven and Earth bow to him.” But in b cid follows the abl.

śúṣmāt, while the geographical feature corresponding to H+E in a, namely párvatā(ḥ) ‘mountains’, is postponed. But surely the clause means “even the mountains fear his explosiveness” (as in the publ. tr.), not “the mountains fear even his explosiveness.”
