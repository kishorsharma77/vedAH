The vs. is nicely framed with vocc., #bṛ́haspate … indra#, thus inviting their identification.

Ge (/WG) take vṛ́kadvaras- as a PN, but Wackernagel’s explan. (KlSchr.

325-26), adducing Aves. duuar, a daevic way of moving, is quite convincing.

ardhám √kṛ ‘go halves’ (also VI.44.18) strikes me as an idiomatic or slangy expression, which may fit with the rare (and also possibly lower-register) future impv. kṛṇutāt.
