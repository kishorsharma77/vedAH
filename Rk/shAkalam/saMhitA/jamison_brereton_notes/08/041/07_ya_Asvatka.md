The purport of this verse and the referents of the unidentified fem. pl. (āsu, pāda a) and masc./neut. pl. (eṣām, pāda b) are completely unclear to me, and multiple suggestions have been made about the identities of these entities and the ways they might fit together. I roughly follow Old’s interpr., but cannot carry it further.
