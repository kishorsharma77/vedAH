Pūsaṇ
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: gāyatrī
This little hymn is noteworthy for its structure, with a lexical chain knitting the  verses together: each verse, except the last (6), contains at least one word or phrase  from the preceding verse. The last verse does contain a phonological echo of the  preceding one: “brother” in verse 5 (bhrā́tā) is echoed by the last word of verse 6  (“bearing” bíbhrataḥ).
It is also noteworthy for the startling, but oddly offhand and uncensorious, allu sion to incest in verses 4–5, where Pūṣan is identified as the lover of his sister and  the wooer of his mother. This follows on three verses (1–3) seeking Pūṣan as chari oteer and giver of wealth, and after the incest verses the poet returns to the chariot  motif to end the hymn (vs. 6). What the poet is alluding to is Pūṣan’s alleged mar riage to Sūryā, Daughter of the Sun, glancingly mentioned in nearby VI.58.4 as  well as in X.26.6.
