In b madhudúghe reprises the same word in the same metrical position in 1b.

What ‘having honeyed commandments’ refers to is not clear to me; it is a hapax and picks up similarly pāda-final śúci-vrate ‘of pure commandments’ (2b) and sávratā ‘having the same commandments’ (3d).

I configure cd slightly differently from the standard, which takes yajñáṃ dráviṇaṃ ca as what H+E establish for the gods and the misc. acc. in d as what they do for us. My interpr. is informed by two passages in the immediately preceding hymn: VI.69.1 juṣéthāṃ yajñáṃ dráviṇaṃ ca dhattam “enjoy the sacrifice and confer wealth” and VI.69.6 dráviṇam dhattam asmé “confer wealth on us.” In both passages dráviṇam is implicitly or explicitly meant for us, while in the 1st yajñám is meant for the gods to enjoy. This matches the use of dráviṇa- elsewhere: it’s what mortals want and gods confer on them. I therefore construe dráviṇam as the first member of the complex NP to be taken with asmé in d (dráviṇaṃ ca … máhi śrávo vā́jam … suvī́ryam. Ge (n. 5c) recognizes the problem but chooses to go with the pāda division. My interpr. has the further advantage of not having to take devátā as an honorary dative, but rather with the instr. value that it should have.
