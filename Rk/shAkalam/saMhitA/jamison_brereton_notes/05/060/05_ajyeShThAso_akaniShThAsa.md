The standard tr. (all ultimately deriving from Sāy.) take Rudra and Pṛśni as the joint subj. of a verb to be supplied (“prepared,” vel sim.), with sudínā as obj. (e.g., Ge “Ihr … Vater … (und) … Pṛśni (haben) den Marut schöne Tage (bereitet)”). This seems unnec. The first part of this hemistich (through pṛ́śniḥ) seems simply to define the Maruts’ parentage: pitā́… rudráḥ is answered by pṛ́śniḥ; no ‘mother’ is necessary, because her role as their mother is virtually her only function in the RV and because the bahuvr. pṛ́śni-mātar- ‘having P. as their mother’, modifying the Maruts, is used three times by Śyāvāśva in this cycle (V.57.2, 3, 59.6). As for sudínā, it is used several times in the kind of nominal cl. envisioned in the publ. tr.; cf. IV.4.7 víśvéd asmai sudínā … “All (days) (will be) day-bright for him”; VII.11.2 áhāny asmai sudínā bhavanti “for him the days become bright shining,” both with dat. as here.

The epithet sudúghā used of Pṛśni may be somewhat ironically meant. At least in VI.66 it is said that Pṛśni only once produced milk (vs. 1), that is, she milked out her sons the Maruts, but that she did not give milk to them (vs. 5).
