The publ. tr. omits the enclitic naḥ; it should be revised to “Pursuing the gods for us while …” Ge takes kṣáyam in b as an Inhaltsakk. (“… sollen … ein Haus … herströmen” (sim. but more elaborate, Re). But a dwelling place is a particularly unlikely object to “stream,” and I prefer to see it as goal (as also Scar 398).

The hapax in d, diviyáj-, has (at least) two possible meanings: ‘sacrificing at day(break)’ as I take it, and ‘sacrificing (to the gods) in heaven’ (so Ge, Re). See Ge’s n. and Scar (398-99). There is nothing in the context that tips the balance one way or the other; I prefer the temporal reading because the other one requires more material to be understood. The word also appears in a metrically disturbed pāda; as it stands it has 12 syllables and a cadence (- ⏑ ⏑ ×) that is bad for both Triṣṭubh and Jagatī. Old suggests the possibility of reading the 1st member of diviyáj- as a monosyllable, either *divyájaḥ or *dyuyájaḥ, which would at least produce an 11-syl.

line, and these possibilities are disc. in more detail by Scar without a firm conclusion.
