The init. voc. sákhāyaḥ in 104.1a is postponed in 105.1a till after táṃ vaḥ.

The 2nd pāda begins with the same middle participle, punāná-, but in diff. case forms: 104.1b dative, 105.1b acc. The rest of b is identical save for the preverb: 104.1b prá gāyata, 105.1b abhí gāyata. The final pādas begin identically, śíśuṃ ná, but go their own ways.
