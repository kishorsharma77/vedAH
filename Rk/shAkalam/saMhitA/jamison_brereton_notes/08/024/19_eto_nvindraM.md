The a pāda is repeated twice elsewhere in VIII: 81.4, 95.7. The reason for the accent on stávāma, which does not begin the pāda and probably not its clause, is unclear, though it may well be connected with its relationship with the exhortative 2nd pl. impv. éta “come on!” It would, in fact, be possible to construe índram with éta nú and begin a new clause with stávāma (“Come now to Indra; let us praise the superior man…”), but this seems unnatural. It is curious that Old does not comment on the accent here or in the other passages.
