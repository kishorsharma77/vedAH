The standard tr. take this vs. as a single clause, and it is certainly tempting.

However, there are several problems. First, despite the hí the main verb vivāsasi is unaccented. It is true that this verb comes only at the end of the vs., while hí is in 2nd position in the first pāda. Old notes the problem but suggests that it’s the result of sliding into being a main clause, presumably because of distance. But the conditioning of verb accent by hí is a robust effect, which does not depend on proximity of the verb to the particle. Another problem is the sá … tvám that opens the vs. As I have demonstrated at length (“sa figé”), sá (+/- tvám) with 2nd ps.

reference is ordinarily found only with imperatives, and the desid. pres. vivāsasi is therefore anomalous.

On these two grounds I therefore divide the vs. into two clauses, ab and cd, with the former an equational nominal cl.: tvám … vásu “you are good(s).” This may seem an outlandish or tortured expression, perhaps a cure worse than the disease.

However, note that the next vs. enables just this identification: in 5b Soma is addressed as “o good one” (voc. vaso), of whose goods (vásvaḥ) we want a part. So the line between good thing(s) and a good (one) is presented as permeable, and Soma may well be both.

This interpr. solves the (lack of) verbal accent problem, but what about sá … tvám. I suggest that this is a syntactically conditioned variant of *tad … tvám …, vásu “you are that, namely good(s).” The neut. tád has been “attracted” to the (underlying) gender of tvám by the well-known syntactic rule of gender attraction of predicated pronouns in nominal equational clauses (see, e.g., Speijer, Vedisch u.

Sanskrit-Syntax, §95b; other examples and sec. lit. citations collected in Brereton 1986: 99-191 and n. 6 ). On the supposed exception, which is not (tat tvam asi in Ch Up), see Brereton “tat tvam asi in Context” (ZDMG 136 [1986]).

śatā́tman- occurs 3x in the RV (I.149.3, X.33.9, and here); in all cases it seems to mean ‘having 100 forms or embodiments’; in X.33.9 it is almost of the “cats have 9 lives” variety. Here it presumably refers to as many varieties of wealth as we can acquire.
