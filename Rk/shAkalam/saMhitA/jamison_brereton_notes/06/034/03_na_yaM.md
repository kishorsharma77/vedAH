To say that praises don’t harm Indra seems a little odd: who would think that they would? nákṣanti is one of the few examples where íd by itself seems to induce accent on the verb; most of the putative examples (see Gr s.v. íd, §5, p. 206) involve pādainitial verbs that could owe their accent to their position. I am not entirely certain, however, that this passage exemplifies this property of íd, since initial índram in b could be enjambed over the pāda break, and nákṣanti start a new clause. V.32.5 presents an undoubted ex. of íd inducing verb accent.

I interpr. yádi in c as *yad ī, i.e., an example of the enclitic acc. ī univerbated with a preceding yád (see my 2002 “RVic sīm and īm,” Fs. Cardona). This is a particularly clear ex., because of the parallel yád later in the pāda (*yád ī stotā́ra śatáṃ yát sahásram “when a hundred praisers, when a thousand”), where an imbalance of subordinators (“if a hundred praisers, when a thousand …”) would not make sense. Moreover the form is followed by a cons. cluster (yádi stotā́raḥ), so that the meter would be unaffected by *ī shortened to -i.
