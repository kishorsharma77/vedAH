There are several metrical problems in this vs. Pāda c has the caesura after 3; there seems no way to remedy this, and the rest of the meter is fine. Pāda a is rather more interesting: the Saṃhitā text as given yields 10 syllables; there are two possible distractions: dhán(i)yā (HvN’s choice) and t(u)vé, but both produce the same bad cadence (⏑ - - ×). As Old points out (ZDMG 55.300 and Noten), if we distract neither of these choices, the vs. reads fine until the last word, with an opening of five and dhiṣáṇā taking post-caesura position. (It is worth noting that dhiṣáṇā- is almost always immediately post-caesura, whether after an opening of 4 or of 5.) All that’s wanting to make a fine Triṣṭubh line is a single light syllable preceding váṣṭi.

Although I would not presume to supply such a syllable (nor does Old), it does seem preferable to allow for a rest here with syncopation, rather than to choose one of the two possible distractions that yield a bad cadence.

The syntax and exact sense of the first hemistich are somewhat unclear. Ge and Re take the pādas together, with dhiṣáṇā as subj. both of váṣṭi and of the infin.

yájadhyai (approx. “the Holy Place wishes to sacrifice in you …”). I have two objections to this interpr.: 1) as Old (ZDMG 55.300) points out (sim. Re; see below), it is Agni who should be doing the sacrificing (though I.109.4, where dhiṣánā presses soma willingly [uśatī́], renders this objection less forceful); 2) the prá beginning pāda b suggests that there’s an intermediate verb form between váṣṭi and the infinitive or at least that there’s a subclausal break at the pāda boundary. Re also notices the 2nd problem indirectly, suggesting in his n. an alternative tr. “elle veut (ceci): qu’(Agni) sacrifie en avant” (with the prá presumably represented by “en avant”). My publ. tr.

reflects such an intermediate verb form, from a supplied form of √dhā, with a form of ‘you’ also to be supplied — with the sense “to (put) (you) forward to sacrifice …” For √dhā + yájadhyai see nearby VI.15.15 ní tvā dadhīta ródasī yájadhyai “One should set you [=Agni] down, to sacrifice to the two world-halves.” The locution dhiṣáṇā √dhā is also quite common, aided by real or pseudo-etymological association; cf. III.31.13 ... dhiṣánā ... dhā́t; III.56.6 dhiṣaṇe ... dhāḥ, IV.34.1 ...

dhiṣáṇā ... ádhāt; VI.19.2 ... dhiṣáṇā ... dhāt; VII.90.3 ... dhiṣáṇā dhāti. However, I am now no longer sure that my objections to the standard tr. are strong enough to merit the additional complexity of my publ. interpr., and I am also disturbed by having to interpr. loc. tvé as “in regard to you.” The next hymn contains a passage that strongly encourages construing tvé here with yájadhyai “to sacrifice in you”:
