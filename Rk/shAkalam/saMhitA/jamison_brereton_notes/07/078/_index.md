Dawn On the lexical marks of this hymn, see publ. intro. The signature word práti opens the hymn and is repeated at the beginning of the first two pādas of vs. 2 and in the middle of 3a; it returns at the beginning of the last vs. (5), thus sketching a ring.

The other signature word, fem. pres. part. vibhātī́- ‘radiating widely’ is concentrated in the latter part of the hymn, ending the pādas 3b, 4b, and 5c.
