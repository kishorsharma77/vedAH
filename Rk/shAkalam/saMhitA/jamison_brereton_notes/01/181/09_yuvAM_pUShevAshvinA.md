This vs. seems to be trying to aggregate as many divinities into the final summons as possible, and it does so rather awkwardly. On the basis of I.117.19 áthā yuvā́m íd ahvayat púraṃdhiḥ “P. called upon just you two [=Aśvins],” I take púraṃdhiḥ here as the separate (female) figure, rather than as an qualifier of Pūṣan like Ge. Also on the basis of that passage I supply ‘summoned’ (generatable from huvé in c) rather than making this part of the b clause with the verb jarate -- though very little depends on one or the other decision.

In c gṛṇānáḥ must be, quite unusually, transitive: it is ordinarily passive. I think the transitive value for this medial participle was induced by its etymological relationship with transitive jarate in b, mediated by the medial participle to that pres.

stem, which also takes the singer, not the besung, as subj. See the very similar passage VI.62.1 aśvínā huve járamāṇo arkaíḥ “I call upon the Aśvins, singing with my chants.”
