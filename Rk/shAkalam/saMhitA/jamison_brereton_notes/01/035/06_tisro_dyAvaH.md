This verse of cosmic mystery decked out in numerology comes as a surprise after the simple, descriptive beginning of this hymn. The syntax of c is ambiguous: Ge (Re / WG) takes amṛ́tā as nom. pl., supplying “him” as acc. with ádhi √sthā: “Alles Unsterbliche ruht (auf ihm)…” I follow Old, who takes it as acc. pl., citing III.38.4 ā́viśvárūpo amṛ́tāni tasthau “Having all forms, he mounted on the immortal (things?).”
