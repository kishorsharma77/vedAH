Note the extreme diminutivization in arbhakó ná kumārakáḥ, signalled by the two -ká-suffixed forms. Presumably the point, in this account of Boyhood Deeds, is to emphasize how small and weak he was to accomplish such deeds.

Both Ge and Old are troubled by vibhukrátu- as a qualifier of the buffalo. Old goes so far as to suggest it should be nominative, but was attracted into the accusative by the preceding accusatives (which, note, are not even adjacent or in the same pāda). This seems unlikely (and unworthy of the usually punctilious Old). Ge also manoeuvres the adjective into referring not to the krátu- of the buffalo, but rather to that of the father and mother: “Er kochte das Büffeltier für Vater und Mutter, das ihrem Verlangen genügte.” I do not understand how he is interpreting the vibhu-, nor do I see any difficulty with assigning the quality named in the compound to the buffalo: that the buffalo is formidable makes the feat of a tiny boy cooking it (and presumably first catching it) all the greater.
