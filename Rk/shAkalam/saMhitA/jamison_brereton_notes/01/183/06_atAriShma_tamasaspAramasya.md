“We have crossed to the further shore of this darkness” announces the end of the night and the beginning of the early morning ritual, to which the Aśvins come.

Given the well-established idiom práti √dhā ‘aim (a praise-hymn like an arrow), I would now slightly change the tr. of b to “a praise-hymn has been aimed at you,” particularly in light of VII.73.1 práti stómaṃ devayánto dádhānāḥ “aiming our praise song as we seek the gods.” The pādas preceding these two expressions, I.183.6a and VII.73.1a, are identical. For further disc. of the ‘aim’ idiom see my forthcoming “Vedic iṣudhyá- and Old Avestan išud-, išūidiia-: The Aim of Praise.”
