Aśvins  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
9 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn begins on a note of mystery, since the identities of the milk-cow, the  “age-old (semen),” and the son of the priestly gift are unclear. The latter half  of verse 1 describes the early morning, and therefore our view is that the first  half does as well. We take the cow as the Dawn, whose milk is light, or pos  
sibly the hymn sung at dawn, and this milk arises from the semen (see III.31.10  for the ellipsis) that is the fire of Agni or the sun or, less likely, soma. Agni, the  son of the dakṣiṇā, the priestly gift that may be actually or metaphorically a  cow, is a “go-between,” either as a messenger who encourages the morning or  as one who goes between heaven and earth. Intricacy then replaces mystery in  the second verse. In 2c, asmát, “because of us” or “from us,” may be construed  with “awaken” or perhaps secondarily with “away”—“We have put the poetic  inspiration of the miser away (from us).” In 2d cakr̥ma “we have put” should be  construed twice with two preverbs and, as Geldner has pointed out, ā́ “here” can  be construed with the two verbs it stands between.  
The remainder of the hymn is neither as mysterious nor as intricate as these  opening verses. It becomes a plea for the Aśvins to appear at the early-morning  soma-pressing, riding in their chariot, which is the sound of the hymns that carry  the Aśvins to the sacrificial site.  
In verse 6 Jahnāvī probably refers to the “wife of Jahnu,” who is the father or  ancestor of Viśvāmitra according to the Brāhmaṇas, although others have taken  it as the name of the clan of Jahnu (Geldner) or as a name of the Ganges (Pirart  2001: 91). If the former, perhaps the poet reminds the Aśvins of the wealth that was  with his family in the past in his wish to renew this friendship with them and their  support for him.
