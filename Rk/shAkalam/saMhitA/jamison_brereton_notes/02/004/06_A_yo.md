The standard tr. take bhā́ti as the operator of the simile (e.g., Ge “Der nach den Hölzern ausschaut(?) wie der Durstige (nach Wasser)”), but this doesn’t make much sense. From vanád- ‘wood-eater’ in the immediately preceding vs. I extract ‘eat’ to govern vánā and to be compared to tātṛṣāṇáḥ ‘thirsting’ in the same semantic realm, hence my “(eating) wood like one athirst.” My ‘red-hot’ for tápuḥ contrasts nicely with kṛṣṇā́dhvā ‘having a black road’, but is unfortunately not entirely legitimate: it is more literally just ‘hot’; there is no color component.

Act. pf. ciketa in c might be expected to mean ‘perceives’, as generally, but it must mean instead ‘appears’; so all the standard tr., and see also Kü (175) on the unusual sense. It is all the more surprising given med. cikite in the same meaning in the immediately preceding vs. (5c). But in this case the two forms may have been seen as metrical variants with identical sense, since ciketa is always pāda-final, cikite always post-caesura, as here.

The unexpressed concept in the simile “like heaven smiling with its clouds” must be lightning, which smiles (I.168.8) or laughs (V.52.6). Lightning is white, like (some) clouds.
