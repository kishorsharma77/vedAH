The vs. begins with an echo of the first vs., or rather the first pragātha, in which the poet called on the Aśvins’ chariot (1a ó tyám ahva ā́rátham), here reprised by ā́… súgmyam … / huvé “I call the easily moving (chariot).” But in pāda b the poet thinks better of it and addresses the Aśvins directly. This change of heart is signalled by vā ‘or’.

Ge, flg. Sāy, takes sakṣáṇī to √sac ‘accompany’, but as Re points out, all other forms of sakṣáṇi- (incl. those separated by Gr into a separate lemma derived from √sac) belong to √sah, and this etymon works fine here.

The echo of the first pragātha continues with the poet’s self-identification as sóbharī at the end of the verse, echoing his self-address with voc. sobhare at the end of 2c. sóbharī here is one of two occurrences of this PN that have apparently fem.

endings (the other is gen. sg. sóbharyāḥ in VIII.103.14). Ge questioning suggests that we might be dealing with a female poet, but this seems highly unlikely, esp. given the voc. sobhare in vs. 2 and elsewhere in this group of hymns (VIII.19.2, 20.19).

See AiG III.183 on masc. -ī-stem PN and their transfer to the i-inflection.
