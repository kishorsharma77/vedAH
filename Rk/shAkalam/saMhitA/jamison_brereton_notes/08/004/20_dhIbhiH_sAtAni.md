There is no consensus on the meaning or etymology of the hapax nírmajām; see EWA s.v. nírmaj-, with various reff. to KEWA; also Old ad loc. Scar does not comment on it, though at least by shape (though not by accent) it appears to be a root noun (presumed gen. pl. to a stem nírmaj-, though EWA allows possibility of -majā, and AiG II.1.220 lists it as nírmajā without further comment). The tr.

‘flawless’ is adopted from Old. Though it may not be possible to determine what the word means or where it comes from, as often it is possible to suggest a motive for its presence in the passage: the phonological figure (nír-)majāmaje, nír.
