As noted above ad IV.16.14 this group of Indra hymns contains a set of anomalously built medial participles to the roots √vaś ‘desire’ and √vas ‘wear’. Here medial thematic uśámāna- is doubly unexpected: this root builds a root pres., with a weak grade uś, but it is only active (with an extremely well-attested act. part. uśánt-), save for three occurrences of athem. uśāná-. And there is no other trace of a 6th class thematic present to account for the -māna-suffix. Neither of these anomalies seems to me particularly serious or hard to account for. As for the middle voice, verbs of desiring seem to fall naturally into the semantic realm of the middle voice, so that a transfer of the participle would not be surprising. Moreover, if we take the redupl.

part. vāvaśāná- as belonging to a pf. of this root (contra Kü, who assigns all these forms to √vāś ‘bellow’), there is a parallel formation with the same voice and same meaning. As for the thematic suffix, Narten (MSS 16: 82 = KlSch 128) suggests that this poet has a penchant for -māna-; if this explanation seems insufficient (and it does to me -- what about uśāná- in IV.23.1 as well as numerous well-behaved athem.

middle participles in his oeuvre) -- one might point to the ambiguous 3rd pl. act.

uśánti (3x), which is presumably the 3rd pl. of the root pres., but could belong also to a 6th class present. (However, I note that the three 3rd pl. forms are found only in I and X.) I take ójaḥ as an acc. of respect with the part.

Ge sees pāda d as reflecting the Winged Mountains story, but this doesn’t seem evident to me.
