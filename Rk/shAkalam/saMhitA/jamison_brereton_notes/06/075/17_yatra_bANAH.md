The beloved RVic contrast of sám and ví is on display here with saṃpátanti (a) and viśikhā́ḥ (b).

Strictly speaking, iva comes too late in the simile kumārā́viśikhā́iva, since the ‘lads’ must definitely belong to the simile, not the frame. This late placement is not unusual, however. Because of the multivalence of ví the bahuvrīhi viśikhá- can have two different senses and has been interpr. with both. If in this cmpd means ‘without’, as often, the whole cmpd means ‘without/lacking hair’ -- so Gr “ohne Kopfhaare”; he is followed by Re (Hymnes spéc.) “aux crêtes dénouées” and Maurer “tuftless.” By contrast, if ví means ‘out, apart’, as often, the cmpd means ‘with hair apart’, that is, perhaps, sticking out every which way. Ge renders it “mit aufgelöstem Haarbusch,” and he is followed by Doniger “with untrimmed locks of hair” and me; Old implicitly assumes the same meaning. If the first meaning is correct, these could in fact be some kind of projectile that lacks fletching. (Acdg. to the internet, it is possible to shoot unfletched arrows, though not generally recommended.) Or perhaps the arrows lost their fletching in the intensity of the shooting. Nonetheless, this seems the less likely sense. If it means “with hair out/apart” (my “unruly hair”), it can refer either to the arrows themselves, coming in from every angle: if each arrow is compared to a strand of hair, the visual effect would be of “bedhead” hair, matted and sticking out in all directions. Or it can refer to the fletching; when innumerable arrows rain down, their feathers would again produce a chaotic visual effect.

The predicate śárma √yam returns from vss. 11-12, and 17d is identical to 12d.
