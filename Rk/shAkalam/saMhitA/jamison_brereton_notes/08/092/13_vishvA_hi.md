Ge takes anukāmā́as ‘in accord with our desires’, but it seems to me unlikely that we are claiming that everything goes as we want it; rather that man proposes, Indra disposes, and in this case he has disposed as we had hoped. This is supported by vs. 14 also, where the desirous ones turn to Indra (for him to fulfill their desires, presumably).
