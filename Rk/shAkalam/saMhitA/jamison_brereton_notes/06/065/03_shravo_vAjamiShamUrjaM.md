There is much disagreement about this vs.; my interpr. is closest to Old. In my opinion (and in Old’s too, though he doesn’t use the term ‘gender-bending’), this once again, as in vs. 1, refers to the gender-bending androgyny of Pṛśni who fulfills both maternal and paternal roles in the birth of the Maruts, though Rudra is identified as their father in pāda a.

The masc. pl. rel. pronouns yé (a) and yā́n (b) have no direct correlative in either c or d. But both the gen. sg. maháḥ in c (see below) and subhvè in d (see below) pick up the masc. pl. conceptually. For a similar -- and clearer -- example see vs. 9, with ab referring to the Marut troop in the sg., and cd picking up that reference with pl. rel. prn. yé (c) and a pl. abl. noun (d).

In b, despite the lack of an identifying gendered pronoun or adj., the subject and the referent of dā́dṛviḥ must be Pṛśni, as is generally agreed.

In c Old discusses the possible interpr. of maháḥ at some length. Much depends on the analysis of vidé. Ge takes it as transitive (“denn die Mutter kennt ihre Grossen”), with maháḥ acc. pl.; Re as well, though with a diff. interpr. of maháḥ. But vidé is overwhelmingly pass.-intrans.; only VII.40.5, cited by Ge (n. 3c) seems to require a transitive interpr. I take vidé in its usual passive sense and interpr. maháḥ as a gen. sg. dependent on mātā́; the sg. referent is the collectivity of the Maruts in their flock.

Note the allit. in c: mātā́mahó mahī́and the etymological relationship between the last two terms. Note also the unusual pāda-final position of sā́, which may result both from being displaced by the alliterative sequence (though why not 1st position?) and from the desire for the striking repetitive ṣā́, sā́over the pāda and clause boundary. This repetition is enhanced by the matching vowels before and after: (mah)ī́ṣā́, sā́í(t). This is only one of two rukied ṣā́'s in the RV (the other = X.64.15 \#ví ṣā́), even though sā́occurs elsewhere in ruki environment (even pāda-finally, as in VIII.27.18 ... nú sā́#). I do not understand the reason for the ruki: there does not seem to be particularly close syntactic nexus between mahī́and sā́here.

Pāda d fully expresses the gender paradox, at least by my interpr. (and Old’s).

As noted in the publ. intro., gárbham √dhā ‘place the embryo’ is the defining idiom of the male role in pregnancy, and here it is difficult (but not impossible!) to avoid taking its subject to be the female Pṛśni. In fact, both Ge and Re (tr.) do wriggle out of it, by making sét [= śā́íd] pṛ́śniḥ a nominal sentence (Re’s “elle (s’appelle) Pṛśni” has a particularly peculiar charm) and supplying Rudra as the subj. of the idiom. But there is no support for this in the passage, and only insistence on expected gender roles can impose the interpr. Indeed the init. sā́íd draws attention to the paradox: “it was just her -- Pṛśni -- who emplanted the embryo. (Interestingly, while Re follows the Ge tack in his tr., in his comm. he embraces the paradox: “c’est Pṛśni qui (en fait : íd) a mis le germe …” Since the tr. and the comm. are found in the same fascicle of EVP -- X, pp. 40 and 98-99 respectively -- his about-face is headspinningly rapid. It should also be admitted that Ge [in n. 3d] also allows the possibility of a single clause and a feminine subject.) This leaves subhvè. In the Rudra-as-emplanter scenario, this dat. refers to Pṛśni (see Ge n. 3d and Re [tr.] “en (l’épouse) feconde,” also Scar 369), but part of the reason for Re’s change of heart was that he did not believe that subhvè could be fem.

(see his comm.). In the Pṛśni-as-emplanter scenario subhvè would refer to Rudra (so Gr, Old, Re [comm.]). I think neither solution is correct. The cmpd. subhū́- in the pl.

is used a number of times of the Maruts (5.41.13, 55.3, 59.3, 87.3), including once in a birth context: V.55.3 sākáṃ jātā́ḥ subhvàḥ “born all at once, good in essence.” As with mahȧḥ in pāda c I interpr. the singular here as referring to the collectivity of the Maruts.
