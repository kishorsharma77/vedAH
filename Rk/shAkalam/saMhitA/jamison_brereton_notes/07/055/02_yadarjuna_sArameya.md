The target of the simile in pāda b, ‘spears’, does not precede the simile marker iva and in fact is as far as it can be from it in a pāda of only 8 syllables: vī̀va bhrājanta ṛṣṭáyaḥ. This arrangement may have resulted from an attempt to keep metrically unfavorable bhrājante out of the cadence.

On the refrain ní ṣú svapa and the present stem svápa- see my “Sleep in Vedic and Indo-European” (KZ 96 [1982/83], esp. 8 n. 3).
