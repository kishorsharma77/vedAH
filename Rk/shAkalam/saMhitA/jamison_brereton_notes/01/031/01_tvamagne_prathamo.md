Wackernagel treats the structure of the bahuvrīhi vidmanā́pas- differently in different parts of the grammar. It is clear that the first member is the instr. of vidmán- ‘wisdom, know-how’, but in some places (II.1.234, III.268) he suggests that the 2nd member is the secondary adj. apás- (so also Gr) and that the first member is accented (as is customary in bahuvrīhis), but with end-accent vidmanā́, rather than the attested independent vidmánā (I.110.6, etc.)(so explicitly III.268). Elsewhere (esp. II.1.301) he groups it with other bahuvrīhis containing -as-stems as 2nd members, which have accented 2nd members (on the 1st syllable), such as pṛthu-pákṣas- (and cf. purū-rávasin 4b). The latter analysis must be correct: inter alia, we don’t expect bahuvrīhis of similar sense to have adjectives as 2nd members, and it seems arbitrary to assume ending accent of the instr. against the independent usage of -n-stems. Therefore, the cmpd. must represent vidmanā-ápas-, built to the neut. -as-stem ‘work’, inflected as a masc. nom. pl. because the cmpd. is a bahuvrīhi and hence an adjective. The meaning should be literally ‘having/displaying work with know-how’.
