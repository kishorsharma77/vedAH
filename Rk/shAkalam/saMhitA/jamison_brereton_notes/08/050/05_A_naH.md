Yet another type of variation, whereby the poet plays on distinct but phonologically or semantically similar words. In 49a ā́na stómam / 50a ā́naḥ sóme the common play on sóma- and stóma- is found. In 49b (d)hyānó áśvo ná / 50b iyānó 'tyo ná the phrases are identical in sense and in morphology (medial athematic participle, a-stem nom. sg.) but use two different lexical realizations for both. In 49c yáṃ te svadhāvan svadáyanti / 50c yáṃ te svadāvan svádanti the clauses are identically constructed, the verbs are identical and have identical meanings, though one is a Class I stem, the other an -áya-transitive, and the vocatives are lexically distinct, though rhyming and identically formed. Finally, both d pādas contain a locative indicating the person(s) at whose sacrifice Indra is.
