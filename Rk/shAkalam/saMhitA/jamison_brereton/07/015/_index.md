Agni  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
15 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
This hymn divides into five tr̥cas. The first triplet of verses defines Agni as the clan  fire, which lives close to the family and protects it. In the second triplet Agni is  invoked to be present as the fire of the sacrifice. Structurally, the second triplet  replicates the first, since the second two verses in each form a single syntactic unit  that begins with a relative clause and continues with an imperative. This repeated  structure iconically suggests the identity of the clan fire and the sacrificial fire, and  in the third triplet the sacrificial fire and the clan fire are explicitly blended. Agni  represents the clanlord and he receives the sacrificial oblations (vs. 7). Through the  sacrifice Agni provides the clan with “heroes,” the male children who guarantee the  prosperity of the clan. In verse 9, as also in VII.1.14, the ákṣarā refers to both a  syllable—its primary meaning—and a cow that always gives milk. Thus, the “syl lable” of the poets comes with thousands of syllables, and because their speech is  an inexhaustible cow, it brings thousands of cattle.  
The fourth tr̥ca takes Agni into the sphere of the minor Ādityas, Savitar, Bhaga,  and the mysterious Diti, who is here the personification of giving embodied in the  sacrificial fire. Geldner suggests that Diti is the female counterpart of Bhaga, but  Diti is as easily male (and we believe more likely so) as female. Diti and Aditi, the  mother of the Ādityas, appear to be in a systematic grammatical relationship, with  the latter being a negated version of the former. But here Diti is not the opposite  of Aditi but seemingly one of her children, since Diti appears alongside other  Ādityas.  
If the fourth tr̥ca emphasizes the gifts of the Agni, the last appeals for his power  to protect from bad times and evil people.
