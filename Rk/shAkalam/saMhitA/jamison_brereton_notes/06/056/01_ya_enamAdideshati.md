As noted in the publ. tr., there is difference of opinion about the purport of pāda c ná téna devá ādíśe. Ge thinks it’s a positive expression (n. 1c): Pūṣan likes porridge so much that he’ll come without being asked twice. Re thinks it’s more ambiguous: for him the idiom ā́√diś means ‘target’ (viser), incl. by evil speech or the like, hence ‘menace’ -- here, targeting Puṣan with the epithet means that he doesn’t have to be targeted “réellement.” (Klein’s [DGRV I.420] I just don’t understand: “by that one is the heavenly one not to be so designated.” Does he think that in using that nickname the human is being too familiar with the god?) I find Re’s interpr. simply puzzling, but, though Ge’s is more persuasive, I think the point is rather that the epithet is a unique designation that picks out Pūṣan once and for all.

The usage of ā́√diś in nearby VI.48.14 is similar; see disc. there. See also VI.57.2 below. MLW adds arguments supporting my interpr.: “In Vedic prose ā́√diś is used to refer to the specification of which god gets which offering and I think this may be an old old meaning of this verb with parallels in Umbrian.”
