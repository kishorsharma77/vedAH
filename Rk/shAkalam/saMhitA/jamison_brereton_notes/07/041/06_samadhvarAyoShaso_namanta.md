This vs., bringing the Dawns into the picture, forms the transition to the extra-hymnic vs. 7 (see publ. intro.). Note that we have the newer nom. pl. form uṣásaḥ in 6, whereas 7, a repeated vs. (=VII.80.3), has the inherited uṣā́saḥ.

The racehorse Dadhikrā(van) seems intrusive in this vs., but he is the subject of the nearby hymn VII.44. Here as there he is associated with dawn and the Dawns.

As suggested in the publ. intro. to that hymn, the association may be with the dakṣiṇā, which is distributed at the morning pressing and which often consists at least partly of horses.
