The fem. instr. ayā́opening this final vs. seems to fulfill the same role as evā́in other hymn-summary vss. Both Ge and Re supply a noun with it (Laüterung / clarification), but though the use of the fem. seems to invite something more than a semi-adverbial ‘in this way’, the model of hymn-summary vss. seems to me to outweigh that consideration.
