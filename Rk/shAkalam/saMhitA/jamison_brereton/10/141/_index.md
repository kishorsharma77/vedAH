Agni Tāpasa
6 verses: anuṣṭubh
This simple hymn continues the message of the immediately preceding one, but  with far less subtlety. The poet calls upon Agni (vss. 1, 3, 6, and implicitly 5) and  an array of other gods, particularly Br̥haspati (vss. 2–5), to ensure that he and his  fellow officiants are well rewarded for their ritual service. The focus on Agni and  Br̥haspati clearly reflects the ritual orientation of the hymn, with Agni representing  the physical activity of sacrifice and Br̥haspati the verbal portion.
