Soma Pavamāna  
Kaśyapa Mārīca  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first three verses of this hymn concentrate on the journey of the soma across  the filter toward the mixing milk and toward Indra, but the militancy characteristic  of the previous hymn (IX.90) asserts itself in verse 4. The final two verses (5–6) ask  for bounties and blessings in return for our verbal and ritual service.
