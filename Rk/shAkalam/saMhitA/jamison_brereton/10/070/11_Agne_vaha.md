O Agni, convey Varuṇa here to our liking, also Indra from heaven and  the Maruts from the midspace.
Let them all, worthy of the sacrifice, sit on the ritual grass. Let the
immortal gods bring themselves to exhilaration at the svāhā-call.

The next two very well-known and often anthologized hymns are attributed to  the legendary Br̥haspati Āṅgirasa, with alternative, equally legendary, authorship  suggested for X.72. According to the Anukramaṇī, X.71 is dedicated to Jñāna  “Wisdom” or “Knowledge,” but it is knowledge in the form of sacred speech (Vāc).  (The word jñāna does not occur in the hymn, or indeed in the R̥gveda.) Hymn X.72,  dedicated simply to the gods (Devāḥ) according to the Anukramaṇī, is a cosmogony  focused on the origin of the divinities.
