The sense of sutyájam is disputed. I ascribe to it the same metaphorical meaning as ‘abandon’ acquires in English, namely acting without constraint. This fits nicely with áhrayas- ‘unabashed, immoderate, unrestrained’. A fire blazing up out of control is presumably meant; in the next pāda it manages to split a rock -- a sudden glancing allusion to the Vala myth, in which Agni usually has no role.
