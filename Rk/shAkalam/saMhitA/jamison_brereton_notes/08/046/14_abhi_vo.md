Ge takes váco yáthā as a truncated clause: “soweit (es) die Rede (vermag),” but, although accented yáthā is seldom pāda-final, unaccented yathā, the simile marker, is almost always so placed. Therefore pāda-final yáthā here must also be a simile marker at least in my view, but see Old for contrary opinion.
