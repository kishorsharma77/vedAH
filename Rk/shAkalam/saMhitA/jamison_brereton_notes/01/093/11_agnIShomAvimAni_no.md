I supply ‘makes’ on the basis of 9c sugáṃ kṛdhi, though strictly speaking “that is an easy way” is perfectly acceptable.

tāvaká-, the vṛddhi derivative of the genitive of the 2nd ps. pronoun, enlarged with -ka-, is a striking form, though exactly what special effect it is aiming at is unclear. For the use of -ka- in pronominal derivatives, see Jamison 2009 (IIJ 52). As discussed there, the -ka- tends to signal a lower register or slangy tone.
