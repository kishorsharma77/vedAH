In c, the presumed main clause to the relative clauses of ab, I have supplied a verb of motion (“should come”), but it might be better, with Ge and Re, simply to take c as the anticipatory qualifier of the subject (índraḥ) of the refrain in d.

The svébhiḥ of c is positioned between two other masc. pl. instr. and could perhaps be taken with both, though I have tr. it only with évaiḥ because svébhir évaiḥ appears to be a fixed expression: I.62.8, VIII.8.13, VIII.97.3, X.67.11.
