The b pāda consists of a single simile; as in nearby IX.46.1b and IX.47.5b, the simile particle iva occurs after the 2nd word in the simile, not the 1st - though here the simile consists of 3 words and so iva is non-final.

The c pāda contains a bold image: “spur on the wheelrim of the music” (vāṇásya codayā pavím). Perhaps not surprisingly, both Ge and Re flatten the image by redefining the verb and one or both of the nouns. Ge’s “Schärfe die Spitze der Rede (des Pfeils)” takes paví- as ‘point’, though in all clear cases it refers to a part of a chariot wheel (see EWA s.v. and Sparreboom, Chariot p. 131 with lit.), the tire or wheel rim, while the verb codayā means ‘impel, spur on’, not ‘sharpen’. His alternative ‘Pfeil’ assumes that vāṇá- is a variant of bāṇá- ‘dart’. Re’s “Aiguisse la pointe de la parole-rhythmé” follows Ge; he justifies ‘sharpen’ with ref. to IX.17.5, but the verb there also means ‘spur on’ and has (in my view) speech as obj. Old is having none of this: he sensibly and firmly says that √cud is esp.

common of the impelling of a chariot [this is not entirely true] and he sees no reason to take paví- in anything but its usual sense. To explain the image he suggests that the operation (that is, presumably the playing) of the vāṇá-, which he takes as a musical instrument, is conceived of like the driving of a chariot, whose wheel is therefore being metaphorically impelled. This seems correct in its main outlines. The image blends the concrete (the chariot) and the metaphorical (music), both potential objects of √cud, in a phrase with the latter as dependent genitive. For √cud + ‘chariot’, cf. X.29.8 rátham … yám .. codáyāse; the substitution of paví- is simply part for the whole. As for √cud + ‘speech’ (vel sim.), cf., e.g., III.62.10 dhíyo yó naḥ pracodáyāt.
