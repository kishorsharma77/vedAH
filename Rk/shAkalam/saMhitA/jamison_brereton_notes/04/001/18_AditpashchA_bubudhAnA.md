I interpr. the “treasure apportioned by heaven” (rátnam … dyúbhaktam) to be in the first instance cows (as in I.73.6), those released from the Vala cave, but the cows conceived of as dawns and therefore as light, including the light of the newly kindled ritual fire. See vs. 10 above, with rátnam … devábhaktam. This buried “light” motif works well with the houses in pāda c, where the ritual fire is at home (see vss.

9, 11 above), and provides an easy transition to the invocation of Agni in the next vs. The subj. of dhārayanta in b I take as the gods in c (with Old, SBE, Hoffmann, WG), rather than taking c as a separate nominal cl. (Ge, Re). Note the chiastic morphological figure in c, allowing alliteration between the nom./loc. pairs: víśve víśvāsu dúryāsu devā́(ḥ).

In d I supply the treasure (in the form of light) as the subj. of satyám astu (so also Hoffmann). This VP should be interpr. in the context of santi satyā́in 7a. See comm. there.
