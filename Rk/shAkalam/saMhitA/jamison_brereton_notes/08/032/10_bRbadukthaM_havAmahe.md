bṛbáduktha- is a hapax and has aggressively non-Indo-Aryan phonology (not one, but two b’s). My rendering is adopted from Weber (1891, cited by EWA s.v. bṛbú-; see also s.v. bṛbáduktha-). The word must deliberately evoke the name and epithet bṛhád-uktha- but should not be emended thereto; see Old and Ge. If Weber’s suggestion is correct, this may be a little joke, implying that Indra is powerful but not very good with words.
