With Old I supply śávasaḥ with sūnúḥ, to complete the common epithet of Agni “son of strength,” which is suggested by the associated instr. śávasā. Indirect support might come from the parallel voc. sahaso yaho ‘o young (son) of strength’ (with a different word for strength, also regularly appearing as an epithet of Agni) that ends the preceding hymn (I.26.10c). However, this supplement is not strictly necessary, and most tr. do not supply it (e.g., Ge simply “unser Sohn”). In favor of a translation like Ge’s is the presence of naḥ in pāda a. However, this could simply be a Wackernagel place-holder for asmā́kam in c. Although the difference might seem slight, in fact the two interpretations are quite different. Ge’s emphasizes that we have created Agni, supplying ‘our’ with śávasā (“unser Sohn durch (unsere) Kraft”); this might suggest that Agni is in our debt because we begot him and he ought therefore to become our benefactor. The other tr. invest Agni with his own strength and hopes that he will graciously use some of it to benefit us.
