A further question concerns the last clause of 9c, prá ca suvā́ti savitā́. Ge (fld.

by Klein [DGRV I.248 n. 93, 251]) takes cá as subordinating, tr. ‘wenn’, thus producing a dependent clause dependent on another dependent clause “who …, when he …” (Re has a fussy interpr. involving an ellipse that I find puzzling.) I see no reason for Ge’s interpr., but take the ca as conjoining the two clauses ab and c (or their verbs). The accent on suvā́ti is already accounted for by its presence in a rel. cl., and I think it more likely that the poet would end the hymn with a ringing announcement of what Savitar is going to do rather than a conditional uncertainty about whether he’s going to do it.

The phrase āśrāváyati ślókena is technically an etymological figure, somewhat obscured by the l-form of ślóka- and its highly lexicalized state.
