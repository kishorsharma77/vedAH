For the pot, see intro. The doubling of the 1st pl. pronoun (naḥ in a, asmábhyam in c) is probably simple redundancy, with naḥ a Wackernagel placeholder at the beginning of the sentence, anticipating the full pronoun that opens c. However the naḥ could possibly be construed with the voc. sátrādāvan ‘who give in every way’ in b, though it seems a bit distant from the enclitic.
