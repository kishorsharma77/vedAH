The vs. is characterized by three root-accented agent nouns (pā́tā a, hántā b, gántā c), all pāda-initial, all with acc. obj./goal. Then in d the pattern is switched: a suffix-accented agent noun (avitā́), interior in its pāda (immed. after caesura) with (objective) gen. complement. All of them are presumably predicates of astu in pāda a. I consider this simply an instance of the RVic tendency to shake up established patterns; I doubt that the poet is attempting to draw a distinction between Indra’s habitual roles as drinker, smiter, and goer, in contrast to a situational role as helper, as Tichy claims (Die Nomen agentis auf -tar- im Vedischen, 298-99; cf. 257 and passim). Among other things, “help” is one of the most frequent things we ask Indra to do for us; it is surely one of his standard, habitual roles. It happens that there is no root-accented *ávitar-, though avitár- is extremely common, and so no such form was available to match the first three -tar- stems in this vs. I do not know if the gap is accidental or systemic.

Note that kārúdhāyas-, a rare bv., reappears here from 12 -- again, a possible reason for attaching this tṛca to the preceding one.
