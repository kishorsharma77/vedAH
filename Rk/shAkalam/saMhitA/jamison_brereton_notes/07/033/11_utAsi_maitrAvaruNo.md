The pub. tr. reads “born from her mind,” but given the uncertainties of this birth story, the mind need not be Urvaśī’s, but someone else’s, or even pure mind. So it might be better rendered as “born from mind.” On the semen (if that’s what the drop is) and the lotus, see disc. ad vss. 10-13.

If the underlying narrative really does involve transporting spilled semen in a leaf and long-distance conception therefrom, it anticipates the MBh narrative in which the king Vasu ejaculates while hunting, catches the semen in a leaf, and tries to send it home to his wife Girikā by enlisting a bird, though the bird and the semen meet with a disaster over water that leads to the semen impregnating a fish (MBh I.57.35ff.).

I take drapsáṃ skannám as a nominal clause, rather than taking cd as a single clause with drapsáṃ skannám coreferential with tvā.
