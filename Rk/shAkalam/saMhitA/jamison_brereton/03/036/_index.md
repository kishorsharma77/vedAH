Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina (1–9, 11) and Ghora Āṅgirasa (10)
11 verses: triṣṭubh
In contrast to the pared-down aesthetic of the immediately preceding hymn, this  one, entirely devoted to Indra’s drinking of soma, presents a series of extreme  images and striking turns of phrase. The emphasis is on Indra’s sheer size and capa ciousness when he drinks soma, and liquid images predominate: he is conceived of  both as a vast container for liquid (vs. 4) and as the liquid itself (vss. 6, 8). These  images of Indra’s vastness are deftly used as measures of his capacity to give to his  human worshipers (e.g., vss. 5, 9, 10).
