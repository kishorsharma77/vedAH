106  
All Gods  
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
7 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7  
After the challenges and pyrotechnics of the previous hymn, this simple appeal  for aid to a range of divinities comes as something of a relief. It is a hymn of the  most straightforward All God type. The most notable feature of the hymn is verse  6, which closely parallels verse 17 of I.105. Here the poet Kutsa is “squeezed down  into a pit” and appeals to the gods for help. There Trita is found in a similar situ  
ation and makes the same appeal. The verse conforms better to its context in this  hymn than in I.105: in I.106 the refrain filling half of each verse calls on the gods  to “rescue us from narrow straits,” as exemplified by Kutsa’s confinement, whereas  in I.105 the poet is tormented by spiritual doubts that only in that one particular verse are conceived of as physical confinement. It seems possible that I.105.17 was  adapted from this hymn.
