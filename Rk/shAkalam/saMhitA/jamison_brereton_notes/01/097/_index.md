Agni The grammatically incomplete refrain of this hymn (ápa naḥ śóśucad aghám “blazing away the bad for us”) is introduced first as the first pāda of this hymn and then repeated as 1c. In that verse, the refrain’s participial construction is integrated into the verse structure, modifying the subject of the main verb śuśugdhi in b. This integration is not found again until vs. 6 and continues thereafter till the end of the hymn (vss. 7-8). However, the semantic distance between the verse proper and the refrain narrows as the hymn progresses. In vss. 2-3 there is no explicit mention of Agni, but in vss. 4-5 he appears, as enclitic pronoun + voc. (te agne) in 4 and gen. (agnéḥ) in 5, though neither is in the appropriate case to match the refrain.
