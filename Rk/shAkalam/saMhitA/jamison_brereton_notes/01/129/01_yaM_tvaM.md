Pādas de show two different constructions with √kṛ ‘make’. On the one hand, abhíṣṭaye káraḥ is a periphrastic caus. “make to prevail,” with abhíṣṭaye parallel to the infinitival medhásātaye ‘to gain wisdom’ in 1a; on the other hand, káraḥ … vājínam is a predicate adj. construction “make (it=chariot) a prize-winner.” Separating the two constructions is the embedded tag váśaś ca “if you wish,” with subordinating ca (see Klein DGRV I.250). Though subordinate clauses are almost never embedded, this functions as a parenthetical like later manye ‘methinks’ and it also intervenes between two clauses.

Most tr. supply the chariot as subj. of f, but this makes difficulties with the acc. of g, since, by the conventions of Atyaṣṭi meter, f and g should form a syntactic unity. I assume instead that sá here refers to Indra in the 2nd ps. and an imperative should be supplied to make a classic “sa figé” construction (see Jamison 1992); note that the next vs. begins with a stripped-down version of the same construction: sá śrudhi “Listen!” As to what imperative to supply, I generate it out of the participial voc. tūtujāna ‘o thruster’ to the root √tuj. Alternatively, it could be generated from the verb found in bc prá (…) náyasi, hence “lead forth.” In g the word order of imā́ṃ vā́caṃ ná makes difficulties. If imā́ṃ vā́cam is a simile, then we might expect the order *imā́ṃ ná vā́cam. However, note I.121.6 asyā́ uṣáso ná discussed above, also with deictic + noun followed by the simile marker, so it may be that the placement is by rule (though this requires more investigation).

Note also that in 5b of this hymn the ná follows a clear two-word simile (without deictic), similarly, if I’m correct, 8g and 5g (cf. also 130.2, 9). Another factor that may have helped determine the placement of ná here is that f ends (tūtujā)na vedhásām and g ná vedhásām, so the displacment of the simile particle would facilitate the echo pattern. Alternatively we might separate imā́m and vā́cam and take the former as part of the frame “(thrust forward) this one like speech.” If “this one” refers to the chariot, we must then assume gender attraction from *imám. WG’s tr.

reflects a separation analysis, but with imā́m also representing vā́cam: “… dieses (Wort) wie das Wort der Vertrauenswürdigen.”
