I take ābhūṣéṇya- as a quasi-desiderative gerundive, parallel to didṛkṣénya- ‘desirable to be seen’ -- hence ‘desirable to become’ à ‘to be emulated’. However it may simply mean ‘to be attended upon’.

The utá introducing the impv. in c is awkwardly rendered as ‘and’. Klein (DGRV I.454) says it means rather ‘therefore’, which works better in English.

However, ‘therefore’ for utá does not have much support (3 passages cited by Klein out of over 750) or a clear path of development, and a closer look at the context does not yield a causal “X, therefore Y” interpr. It is possible that the morphologically ambiguous dadhātana is not an imperative but an injunctive, which would yield a more acceptable pendant “and you establish us in immortality.” And it is also possible that the utá here loosely matches the other 3rd-pāda utá-s in 2c, 7c, while anticipating 5a #úd.
