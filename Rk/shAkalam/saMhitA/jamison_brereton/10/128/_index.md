All Gods  
Vihavya Āṅgirasa  
9 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 9  
Anxiety about rival sacrifices, a common preoccupation of the R̥gveda, begins  and informs this hymn. The first two verses situate the performance of the hymn  “at the competing invocation(s)” (vihavá, a derivative of which provides the poet’s  name, Vihavya, in the Anukramaṇī)—a moment when sacrificers all over the Ārya  lands are inviting the same gods to their own separate sacrifices. The poet urges his  own case with a series of emphatic fronted 1st-person singular pronominal forms  (“mine,” “to me,” etc.) in the first four verses. The potential competing sacrificers in  these early verses are transformed into even more threatening figures as the hymn  progress—haters (vs. 5), violent challengers in battle (vs. 6), rivals (vs. 9). The poet  then asks for the aid of the gods in repulsing them and in protecting him.  
The grammar and diction of the hymn are straightforward and spring no  surprises.
