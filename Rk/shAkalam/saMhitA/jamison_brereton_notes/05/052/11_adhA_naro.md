My interpr. of this vs. follows from that of 10 and diverges from those of others. By my interpr. the nom. plurals are further names the Maruts call themselves, shown most clearly by the íti ending pāda c. Most interpr. take c with d, syntactically and semantically divorced from ab -- e.g., Klein (DGRV II.102-3, closely flg. Ge) “(And) the men proclaim it (as worthy) and (their) teams proclaim (it so), and wondrous (are their) forms, worthy of being seen, (of whom they say,) “(They are) from the distance.” But the ádhā’s that open pādas a, b, and c impose, or at least beg for, a parallel interpr. of the three pādas, esp. with the íti closing the last, and the parenthetical “(of whom they say)” is ad hoc, generated only from the íti of c.

One of the problems not mentioned by the standard interpr. is the intrusive ní in pāda a. The verb √uh does not otherwise occur with this preverb, and since ohate is surrounded by identical forms without preverb (10d, 11b) it seems unlikely that only the middle one would have the preverb. It might be loosely inspired by the ni in niyúta(ḥ) in b, but Śyāvāśva does not seem the type of poet to throw in verbal fragments without function. I suggest rather that it continues but varies the naming pattern of 10ab with PREV-pathi-, here with the ní a very minimalist predication of náraḥ “men down.”
