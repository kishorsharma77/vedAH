Ge takes the loc. phrase víśvāsu … samátsu with hávyaḥ and construes bhūṣatu in b with the accusatives in c. This is certainly possible and this disposition of the loc. may make better, or smoother, sense. However, because of the verse structure, I would prefer to keep bhūṣatu interpretationally in the first hemistich, and ā́√bhūṣ can take the loc. (cf. VIII.66.7d, 8b, X.160.5). I then also supply bhūṣatu with the second hemistich, to be taken with the preverb úpa and the accusatives, since úpa √bhūṣ does take the acc. (e.g., V.75.8, VI.62.4).
