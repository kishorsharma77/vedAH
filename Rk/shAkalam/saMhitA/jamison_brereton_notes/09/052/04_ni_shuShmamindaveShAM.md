The main cl. of ab lacks a finite verb; the preverb ní suggests several possibilities.

Ge supplies tira on the basis of IX.19.7 ní śúṣmam ... tira (his “halte,” my “undermine”), which is certainly possible. However, on the basis of nijaghní- in the next hymn, IX.53.2, as well as the two forms of √vadh in the immediately preceding vs. (52.3 vadhaír vadhasno), I prefer a form of ní √han (/ √vadh). Nothing depends on the choice, as long as the intent is hostile.

Ge construes jánānām in b with voc. púruhūta “du vielgerufener der Menschen,” which may be correct, given IX.64.27 as well as the nom. phrase puruhūtó jánānām in IX.87.6. (I therefore entertain the alt. tr. “o much invoked of the people.”) But on that basis he should construe eṣām in a with the same voc., since IX.64.27 has the same phrase, … eṣām, púruhūta jánānām, where there is no other obvious way to interpret it and Ge takes the eṣām with jánānām. But here he construes eṣām separately, with śúṣmam. Both Re and I take both genitives with that noun, IX.64.27 notwithstanding.

All of us must face the problem that the rel. cl. in c, which most naturally refers to the blustering people of ab, is in the sg. (yáḥ … ādídeśati). This must simply be a constructio ad sensum, or rather the picking out of a particular referent in the group of hostile men mentioned in ab.
