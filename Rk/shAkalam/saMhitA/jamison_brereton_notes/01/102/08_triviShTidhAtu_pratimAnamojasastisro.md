Contra most tr., I prefer to take ab as separate clauses, rather than as anticipating bhúvanam in c.

The difference between triviṣṭi-dhā́tu- and tri-dhā́tu- (used of bhū́ma in IV.42.4) is not clear to me. The stem triviṣṭí- on its own (IV.6.4, 15.2) qualifies Agni’s ritual actions as performed “with triple toil” (√viṣ ‘be active, labor’), but that sense doesn’t work here. As far as I can see, it’s a way of indicating that the divisions each have three divisions of their own, but the semantic pathway to this value is unclear.
