As noted in the publ. intro., the first hemistich contains pedagogical vocabulary, the contrastive “we wish to comprehend” (ā́… cikitsāma) and “we will not ‘recite’ you” (ádhi caná tvā némasi). The lexeme ádhi √i lit. ‘go over’ (which goes nicely into Engl. in its idiomatic sense); in later Vedic it means ‘study (a text)’, which is an oral culture means ‘recite aloud’, and this appears to be its meaning here (contra most tr., incl. Ge and Schmidt). Followed directly by cd, where Apālā insistently asks the soma to flow “softly” (śánaiḥ … śanakaíḥ), this hemistich indicates that Apālā wants to learn and understand Indra’s intentions, but she will not reveal his presence by announcing him aloud. (See disc. Jamison 1991: 164 and n.

43.)
