Here the intensive of √dṛ, ví dardaḥ, takes a plural obj. púraḥ ‘fortresses’.

See disc. above ad 8a.

The simile and frame in d are curiously intermingled, with the object in the frame, púraḥ ‘fortresses’, dropped into the middle of the simile átkaṃ ná … jarimā́ “like old age a cloak.” I also don’t quite understand the content of the simile. It’s presumably the age of the garment, not of its wearer, that causes the garment to fall apart. WG seem to take jarimā́not with the simile but the frame: “Wie einen Reisemantel spaltet das Alter die Palisaden auseinander.” This would solve the intermingling problem identified above, but it otherwise doesn’t fit the mythic context. Surely it would be ignominious for Indra if, instead of Indra’s heroically tearing apart these mighty fortresses, they just fell apart from decrepitude and deferred maintenance. The WG n. on the passage calls the simile a Sprichwort and it is not clear to me what function they see jarimā́as playing.
