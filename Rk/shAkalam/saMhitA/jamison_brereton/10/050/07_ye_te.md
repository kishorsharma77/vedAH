Those who craft sacred formulations for you when the soma is pressed,  for you to give of goods and of good, o inspired one,
through the thought of your favor they will go forward along the path,  at your exhilaration on the pressed soma-stalk.

The gods find him hidden in  the waters and entice him back by promising him a share in the sacrifice.
