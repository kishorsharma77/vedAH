As noted in the publ. intro., this verse and the rest of this little section are reminiscent of the final vs. of III.33.13, against disaster on a journey, specifically there a river crossing.

The hapax pātalyè is entirely unclear, besides being a dual referring to some part of the chariot.

On the thematic medial stem dáda- in the sense ‘hold, keep safe’, see Gotō (1st Class, 171-72, flg. Wackernagel).
