As pointed out in the publ. intro., this vs. is strongly marked as a hymnfinal vs., with complementary yáthā ‘even as’ (ab) and evā́‘in just this way’ (cd) clauses, bringing this 4-versed hymn to a close. The matches between clauses are more expicit than in some such structures: the two finite verbs, impf. ápavathāḥ and impv. pavasva, match exactly save for tense/mood, and the root noun cmpd. vayodhā́ḥ of pāda a is recast as a syntagm dráviṇaṃ dádhānaḥ in c with the same root √dhā.

The final pāda consists of two brief clauses, both somewhat aberrant. The first contains an idiom I have not found elsewhere, sám √sthā + LOC. My tr., “stand sideby-side by Indra,” is meant to capture this slightly off expression. The second clause, “beget/generate weapons,” is syntactically fine but semantically odd.
