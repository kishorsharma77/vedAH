This verse is parallel to its twin in I.68, with the same verb: #pári … babhūtha [/bhúvat 68.2]… ; the emphasis on Agni’s status among the gods (devó devā́nāṃ 68.2, devā́nām pitā́69.2); and an instr. in -tvā (mahitvā́68.2, krátvā 69.2), though to non-parallel stems (mahitvá-, krátu-). It is therefore surprising that tr. do not note the parallelism of the two verses or necessarily treat them in the same way.

In particular, both Ge and Old (SBE) take the pári…bhúvat in 68.2 as ‘encompass’, but pári … babhūtha in 69.2 as ‘be superior, excel’. (Re tr. both as ‘encompass’ and WG both as ‘excel’.) Given the focus on encompassing/surrounding in this set of hymns (see disc. ad I.65.3 above), I think both lexemes should be tr. the same way, and each requires an object to be supplied. In 68.2 I supply “the still and the moving” from the previous verse; here I would use the conjoined world-halves, also from the previous verse.

The poet handles the parallelism between the two verses in almost a syncopated fashion. As just noted, each verse contains the idiom pári √bhū; in 69.2 this is contained within the first hemistich, whereas the finite form bhúvat opens the second hemistich in 68.2. But 69.2 has the almost identical form bhúvaḥ in that same position, but not as part of the idiom (see also bhúvat I.67.2, 65.3). As Hoffmann argues (e.g., 1967: 236-37), bhuvaḥ, bhuvat are formally ambiguous, both injunctive to the thematic aorist and subjunctive to the root aorist of √bhū. In the publ. tr. I render bhúvaḥ in I.69.2 as a subjunctive, but now I am inclined to take it as a presential injunctive “you become…” parallel to my interpretation of bhúvat in 68.2.
