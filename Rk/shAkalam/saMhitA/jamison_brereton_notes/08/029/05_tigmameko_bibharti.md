On jálāṣa- see comm. ad I.43.4.

The 2nd pāda has 10 syllables rather than the expected 8. Unfortunately deleting the somewhat pleonastic jálāṣa will not work because of its syllable count. It would be possible to delete either of the first two adjectives -- śúcir ugráḥ -- but I see no justification for that. It could be noted, however, that the other occurrence of jálāṣabheṣaja- is found at the end of an 8-syllable pāda, preceded only by rudrám (I.43.4).
