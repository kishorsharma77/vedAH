As disc. in the publ. intro., in this hymn the poet provides several different metaphorical versions of the same ritual act. This vs. contains two of those alternatives: in ab Soma is groomed “by the granddaughters of Viviasvant,” a reference to the fingers, which were characterized as “troops of five kinsment” in 2ab; in c Soma makes cows like a garment (gā́ḥ kṛṇvānó ná nirṇíjam), a variant of 3c “clothes himself with cows” (góbhir vasāyáte). For the exact phrase see IX.107.26 and for variants without the simile particle IX.86.26, 95.1.
