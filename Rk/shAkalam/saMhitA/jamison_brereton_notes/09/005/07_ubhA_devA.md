My interpr. of this vs., esp. pāda c, differs from the standard. I assume that pávamānaḥ and índro vṛ́ṣā are two separate entities: Soma Pavamāna and Indra the bull -- and that they are identified with the two divine Hotars (hótārā daívyā) of b. Old, Ge, and Re all take c as an equational clause: Soma Pavamāna = Indra the bull; there is just one figure, and it has nothing to do with the two Hotars. In their favor is the fact that pāda c has reverted to nominative, whereas the duals are acc. in ab. However, I find it difficult to assume that mentioning the two major divine figures in the Soma Maṇḍala, Soma and Indra, in conjunction with a dual, is utterly unconnected with the dual divine figures in ab.

Otherwise pāda c is a non sequitur. (On 9c and IX.6.2 see below.) As for the reversion to the nominative, I find this somewhat troubling, but it is enabled by the fact that in duals nom. = acc.
