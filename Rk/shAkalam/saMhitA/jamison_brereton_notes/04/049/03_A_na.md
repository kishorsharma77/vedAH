As noted above, índraś ca in b signals a headless Vāyav Indraś ca construction, and indeed the “Vāyav” is apter than might appear at first glance. Pāda b is identical to I.135.7c, which is an Indra and Vāyu hymn. The missing voc. is found there, in pāda a: vāyo. Clearly our b was adapted from I.135.7, with the non- conforming god lopped off in this expression. I have not attempted to render the voc. dvandva plus mutilated Vāyav Indraś ca, unlike the standard tr., which supply an extra verb in a and an extra voc. in b.
