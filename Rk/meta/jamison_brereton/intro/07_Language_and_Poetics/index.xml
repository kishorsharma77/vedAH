      <description>Sanskrit is an inflectional language with an especially rich morphology, and most of the grammatical information that is carried in English by word order and by separate elements such as prepositions and auxiliary verbs is coded in Sanskrit on the word itself. R̥gvedic poets glory in their grammar and are skillful in exploiting not only the many distinctions it provides but also grammatical ambiguities and neutralizations of grammatical distinctions. Moreover, since basic information, such as the identity of the grammatical subject and object, is coded on the word, the poet is free to use word order for rhetorical purposes, placing particularly significant words in emphatic positions such as initial in the verse line.</description>

      <description>There is no single, universally applicable template to which all, or even most, R̥gvedic hymns conform. At best we can state the uselessly vague obvious: most hymns praise a god or gods, often with reference to their attributes and deeds, and explicitly or implicitly request goods and services from the divinities in return for this praise. This exchange is often effected during the sacrifice at which we hope they are present, either because they are part of the sacrificial paraphernalia (like Agni and Soma) or have come as invited guests.</description>

      <description>The R̥gveda is rich in imagery: the procedures of sacrifice, the exploits of the gods, the activities of men, and the elements and functioning of the cosmos are constantly presented in images of something else, images based on similarity and parallelism.
Similie On the formal level by far the most common way of expressing these images is in a simile—the most common poetic device in the R̥gveda, as it is in Classical Sanskrit poetry.</description>

      <description>Much of the R̥gveda is enigmatic, not only because of our distance from the time of its creation, but also because the poets meant it to be enigmatic. They valued knowledge, especially the knowledge of the hidden connections (the bandhus discussed above) between the visible world, the divine world, and the realm of ritual.+++(5)+++ They embedded that knowledge in hymns that were stylistically tight and elliptical, expressively oblique, and lexically resonant.</description>

      <description>The most conspicuous and ubiquitous formal feature of the R̥gveda is meter. The hymns are composed in a variety of meters, but all of the meters are syllable-counting and quantitative. That is, they consist of lines containing a fixed number of syllables, arranged in patterns of “heavy” and “light” syllables (the “quantity” referred to by the term “quantitative”). Heavy syllables contain a long vowel (a class that includes e and o) or diphthong or a short vowel followed by two consonants (which need not belong to the same word) and are symbolized in Western analysis by a macron (¯).</description>
