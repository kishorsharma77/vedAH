Old and Ge opt for the Kashmir Khila reading, nom. sg. pūtákratāyī, but it hardly makes sense that Dasyava Vṛka would be giving away his mother. It makes better sense to take the Saṃhitā reading pūtákratāyai (for *pūtákratāyyai), dat. (for gen.), “(the female one) of Pūtakratāyī,” namely her daughter and Dasyava Vṛka’s sister, who would be a more likely gift-in-marriage.

yūthyā̀m is probably a faulty reading. The Khila has yūthyàm, but Ge’s suggestion, yūthyā̀, seems plausible.
