The injunc. sī́dat, in conjunction with the acc. of extent of time mā́nuṣā yugā́“through the human lifetimes,” seems almost to have shed the literal sense of the root √sad ‘sit’ in favor of expressing pure durativity (“who, through the human lifetimes, has (always) been …”) -- though the immediately following hótā evokes the standard phrase for the installation of Agni as Hotar, with the full ‘sit’ clearly present if metaphorically meant. as in VI.1.2 ádhā hótā ny àsīdaḥ … (“then you sat down as Hotar”) in this Agni cycle. I rather imagine both senses are meant.
