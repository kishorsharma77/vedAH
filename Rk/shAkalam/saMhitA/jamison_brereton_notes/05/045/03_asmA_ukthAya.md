This vs. describes dawn as happening in response to and as a result of the hymn recited at this very moment (hence asmaí) at the dawn sacrifice. The two heavy dative phrases, polarized at both ends of the first hemistich, asmā́ukthā́ya and janúṣe pūrvyā́ya, have different functions in the clause. The gaping mountain is an allusion to the opening of the Vala cave, metaphorically applied to the advent of dawn from the night darkness.

In the second hemistich, in c “heaven achieves success” must, in my view, allude to the successful emergence of dawn’s light from the heavenly realm. This is contrasted with d, where an unnamed plural subject is desiring to win the earth (āvívasantaḥ … bhū́ma) -- in my opinion, this refers to the fact that features on the earth come only slowly to visual definition at dawn, even as the light comes streaming out of the sky. The unknown subjects are probably the poets responsible for “this hymn here” (asmā́ukthā́ya) in pāda a; they must continue their verbal efforts, “exhaust themselves” (dasayanta), in order to bring the earth into focus.

Supplying ‘poets’ as subj. generally follows Hoffmann, who thinks esp. of the Aṅgirases (174 n. 126), contra Ge, who takes bhū́ma as subj. (sim. Lü). On dasayanta, see my -áya-Formations, p. 59. Some take the verb rather to √daṃs ‘work wonders’; see esp. Thieme (loc. cit., n. 7), fld. by Schmidt, WG. This cannot be excluded, but I find the ‘exhaust’ meaning more poetic compelling.
