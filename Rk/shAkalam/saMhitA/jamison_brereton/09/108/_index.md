Soma Pavamāna
Gaurivīti Śāktya 1–2, Śakti Vāsiṣṭha 3, 14–16, Ūru Āṅgirasa 4–5, R̥jiśvan Bhāradvāja  6–7, Ūrdhvasadman Āṅgirasa 8–9, Krtaya ̥ śas Āṅgirasa 10–11, R̥ṇaṃcaya 12–13 16 verses: kakubh alternating with satobr̥hatī, except gāyatrī yavamadhyā 13, arranged  in pragāthas
The Anukramaṇī names seven different poets as authors of this hymn; the  Anukramaṇī’s divisions do not correspond at all to the clear pragātha structure,  however, and therefore seem questionable. Within the pragāthas there is, more often than not, syntactic dependency between verses (e.g., vss. 3–4, 7–8, 13–14), as well as  some thematic continuity. Stylistically the hymn, especially toward the beginning, is  characterized by rather choppy syntax and often presents itself as a mosaic of semi self-contained phrases. On the other hand, there are signs of ring composition: the  first phrase of the hymn, “purify yourself as the most honeyed for Indra, o Soma”  recurs as the framing words of the first verse of the final pragātha (vs. 15), and the  relative clause about the drinking of soma that introduces verse 2 is echoed, with  the same relative pronoun, in 14a.
Allusions to the Vala myth are found in the interior of the hymn (vss. 4, 6). The  heavenly soma, conceived of in part as rain, is also a prominent theme (vss. 9–11,  and also probably vss. 4 [the “dear immortal one”] and 6 [the “watery” cows]). This  cosmic soma is, as usual, a counterpoint to the ritual soma, the standard details of  whose preparation are found throughout.
