The tr. of this vs. needs to be emended: because paridhā́vasi has an accented verb, it must belong to the yád clause, and pāda c must be the main clause. I would now add to the tr. of c “(you are) fit …” Alternatively, the vs. could be entirely a subordinate clause and dependent on either 4 or 6, hence, e.g., “purify yourself … (4), when pressed by the stones you run around the filter, fit for the fundament of Indra (5),” with no alternation of the transl. of 5, but a comma, not a period, at the end of 4.

What dhā́mane is meant to convey here is unclear, and numerous incompatible suggestions have been made -- e.g., Ge “(Eigen)art,” Re “vocation” (and see his n.). I long ago (Ged. Cowgill) suggested that this is a somewhat heavy-handed pun, with “fundament” both referring to Indra’s fundamental being and to his physical foundation, his bottom.
