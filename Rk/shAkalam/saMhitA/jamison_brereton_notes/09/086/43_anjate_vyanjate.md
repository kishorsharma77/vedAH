The first hemistich is striking with its series of identical verbs in pāda a, with pāda b ending with the same verb: añjáte vy àñjate sám añjate, … abhy àñjate.

The first pāda lacks a syllable (rest at 4); as Old suggests, the metrical irregularity is most likely meant to call attention to the word play.

Ge, Re, Lü (239) take the various verbs as reflex., with Ge (n. 43ab) taking the subj. as the soma-drinking singers and Re as the waters. But though mid. √añj is probably more often reflex./pass. than trans., it can be the latter, and that makes more sense here. Cf., e.g., IX.97.57 sám añjate rūpám “they jointly anoint his form,” and recall the many times in this maṇḍala in which soma “is anointed,” using the true passive ajyáte (-se) (often as a pun with ‘is driven’ to √aj). See especially in the next tṛca of this hymn 47c góbhiḥ … samajyáse, in the same metrical position as sám añjate here. I supply the default Soma as obj. throughout the first hemistich; he is found as explicit (though metaphorical) obj. in the 2nd hemistich. As for the subj. of all these verbs, I agree with Re that it is the waters.

The “ox flying in the burbling up of the river” of pāda c is an ex. of the layers of metaphor just alluded to above: it compresses three different representations of Soma into a single image.

I take the subj. of gṛbhṇate and referent of hiraṇya-pāvā́ḥ in d still to be the waters, with āsu functioning as reflexive. Re explicitly changes his subj. here to “les hommes.”
