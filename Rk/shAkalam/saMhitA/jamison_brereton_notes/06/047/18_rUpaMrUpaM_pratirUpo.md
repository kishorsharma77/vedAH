This vs. concerns Indra’s shape-shifting propensity, enabled by his māyā́-.

It is a slightly more complex formulation of III.53.8 rūpám-rūpam maghávā bobhavīti, māyā́ḥ krṇ̥ vānás tanvàm pári svā́m “Form after form the bounteous one assumes, wrapping his own body in tricks.” Although prátirūpo babhūva should lit.

mean “he has become one having a form corresponding …,” this seemed awkward.

Ge thinks the form in b is Indra’s true form, to be recognized behind the various disguises in pāda a; by contrast, I think each form Indra assumes is meant for display and none of them is the “real” one. práti √cakṣ is the lexeme used for the display of the girl at the svayaṃvara; see its use with Dawn in I.113.11 and 124.8.

Each constituency is shown a different form—hence the āmreḍita rūpáṃ-rūpam in a and the thousand horses in d, which presumably take each different form of Indra in a different direction.
