svānā́saḥ can be both the nom. pl. masc. of the adj. svāná- ‘resounding’ (√svan) and the med. rt. aor. part. to √su ‘press’, in passive usage as is usual for this part. I consider the ambiguity intentional and render it twice (“while being pressed … resounding”), but although both Ge (n. 1a) and Re (with more fuss) recognize the double identity, they render only the ‘resound’ sense that is appropriate to the simile.
