The publ. tr. should have a close parens after “[horses, etc.].” I interpret this verse in the context of its pragātha. The question is who are the kin that Indra has and we do not. I suggest that Indra’s “kin” are the horses, cows, and so forth named in vs. 3. In VIII.68.19 the patrons are called vā́ja-bandhu- ‘having prizes as kin’, as a hint that they should give them to us. I think the same image is at work here: we lack kin, and you have these desirable kin (horses, etc.) that could become akin to us too.

In the second hemistich these kin become dhā́māni. The stem dhā́man- is of course a highly charged and multivalent word, but in this case I think it comes close to its literal sense: ‘deposits’, that is, things put or set down (√dhā), which Indra is to bring to deposit on the ritual ground.
