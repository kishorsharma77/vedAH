sthātā́m and caráthām are pseudo-genitive plurals to this merism much favored by Parāśara. There’s no orthodox way to generate them morphologically; Re’s suggestion that sthātā́m is a compromise between *sthātrām and something that looks more like a gen. pl. and that caráthām simply copied it seems a reasonable proposal, however sketchy the details.
