On the vaśā́cow, see my Hyenas (258-60), building on H. Falk, “Zur Tiersucht im alten Indien” (IIJ 24: 169-80). Although often tr. “barren cow,” a vaśā́ is one that has been mated but has not yet calved -- so possibly barren, possibly not.

My tr. here, “mated cows,” is not fully accurate but far less awkward than accuracy would require.

WG supply “verses” with aṣṭā́padībhiḥ, though they allow the possibility of a cow in their n. Although this pun is probably lurking here -- eight-footed verses would of course be pādas with eight syllables -- the primary reading must be some sort of bovine, given the words with which it is parallel. See Old’s comment on this vs. (SBE).
