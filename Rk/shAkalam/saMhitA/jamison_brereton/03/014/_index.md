Agni  
R̥ṣabha Vaiśvāmitra  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
The hymn describes and praises Agni as the master of the sacrifice. The first verse  announces this theme, describing Agni as the Hotar and the “real sacrificer and best of  sages.” In the first verse the poet also mentions Agni’s “chariot of lightning” by which  he speeds to the sacrifice, and he then returns to the image of the chariot in the last  verse. In that final verse, however, the “chariot” is, as often, the sacrifice itself. The last  verse, therefore, takes the role of Agni as priest and the description of Agni as having a  “chariot of lightning” in verse 1 and combines them in the image of chariot as sacrifice.
