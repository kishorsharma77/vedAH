It is curious that the impv. mandasvā is not accented in this clause, despite the hí, nor is it in the identical vs. VI.45.27 or in VI.23.8 also with sá mandasvā hí ...

I have no explantation; Old notes the lack of accent and gives a ref. to his treatment in ZDMG 60, but in fact there he does nothing more there than note the passages.
