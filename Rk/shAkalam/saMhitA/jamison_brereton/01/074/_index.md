Agni
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
9 verses: gāyatrī
The favor shown to the pious man by Agni is the theme of this short hymn. The  beneficiary of Agni’s patronage is identified as dāśvā́ṃs “pious” in verses 2, 8, and  9, and Agni’s activities on his behalf are the subject of the middle verses 4–5. These

activities are mostly the familiar ones, of serving as messenger between the mortal  and divine realms and going after the gods in order to bring them to the sacrifice  (see esp. vss. 4, 6–7), but Agni is also credited with aiding the pious man under  attack (vs. 2), leading to the god’s covert identification with Indra, via the epithet  “Vr̥tra-smasher” (vs. 3). Another unusual feature of this hymn is the appeal to what  “the people say” about Agni and his devotee (vss. 3, 5).
