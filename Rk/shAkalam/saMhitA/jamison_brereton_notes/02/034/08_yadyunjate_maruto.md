Pāda c is a variant on an idea expressed several times elsewhere. that the other fires are mere twigs of Agni, the god Fire. Cf., e.g., I.59.1 vayā́íd agne agnáyas te anyé. It seems significant that “the others” are not identified here as fires but as entities, beings (bhúvanāni) -- in my view, because the identification of Apām Napāt with Agni that brings the hymn to its climax is only partially complete here, and the poet is being canny about not directly referring to fire, though at the same time using diagnostic vocabulary and phraseology.

Note the etymological figure #prá jāyante … prajā́bhiḥ#.
