The phrase abudhyám ábudhyamānaṃ suṣupāṇám “not to be awakened, unawakening, gone to sleep” must be proleptic, expressing the state the serpent will be in after Indra has done his work on him: ‘put to sleep’ and similar idioms are standard euphemisms for death in Vedic, as in many languages (e.g., modern English). See my “‘Sleep’ in Vedic and Indo-European,” Zeitschrift für vergl.

Sprachforschung (KZ) 96 (1982/83) 6-16. I do not think, pace most tr., that this depicts a drowsy Vṛtra whom Indra woke up to fight. For further disc. see I.103.7 and comm. thereon.

The hapax aparván at the end of d is picked up by párvatānām at the end of 4d. (They are, of course, synchronically unrelated.)
