The first hemistich begins and ends with utá. The pāda-final utá of 6b puts a cap on the series of verse-initial utá’s that began in 3a (3a, 4a, 5a, 6a). This is perhaps fitting because vs. 6 ends the capacious list of gods of every sort (from mighty Indra to shadowy Aja Ekapad) who have been strung together additively.

The vs., or rather pādas a and d, plays on ś: śáṃsam uśijām … śmasi / āśuhémā … śámi. This may be in part to showcase the unusual truncated verb śmasi ending pāda a; note that verse-final śámi is a virtual anagram of this verb. This śámi is also echoed by hemistich-final sám in 7b (in an unusual position). There are also echoes from earlier in the hymn: āśu- picks up āśávaḥ (2a) as ékapād does pádyābhiḥ (likewise 2a). IH cleverly points out that the position of śmasi after (i)va ([i]va śmasi) hints at the root √vaś. See vaśmi in the next vs. The Uśij-priests are credited with the production of a particular śáṃsaelsewhere, the āyóḥ śáṃsa- (IV.6.11, V.3.4). For further see comm. ad II.32.2.
