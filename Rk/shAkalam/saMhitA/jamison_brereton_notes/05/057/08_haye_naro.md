The vs. consists almost entirely of accented vocatives. Only the last phrase bṛhád ukṣámāṇāḥ escapes the voc. and that probably because accent conversion would be tricky.

The juxtaposition (across hemistich boundary) of ṛ́ta-jñāḥ and sátya-śrutaḥ is striking -- and in my opinion telling with regard to the difference between ṛtá- and sátya-, both often tr. ‘truth’. Here ṛtá- is something one knows, but sátya- is something one hears. In my view ṛtá- is the immanent truth -- the principles and relations that lie underpin the world as we know it -- while sátya- is the realized truth.

In some contexts this can be simply palpable reality, but here I think it refers to how ṛtá- is realized verbally, in the formulations of poets, available to be heard.
