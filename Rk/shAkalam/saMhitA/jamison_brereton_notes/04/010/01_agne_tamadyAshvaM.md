With most interpr., I supply ‘sacrifice’ with tám in pāda a, as the object of the verb ṛdhyā́ma in d.

The accent on ṛdhyā́ma is anomalous within Oldenberg’s persuasive characterization of the meter of this hymn, since by this analysis ṛdhyā́ma is the main verb and interior to its Triṣṭubh pāda. I assume it acquired this accent redactionally after the meter was misanalyzed, with a pāda break inserted just before the verb. So also WG.
