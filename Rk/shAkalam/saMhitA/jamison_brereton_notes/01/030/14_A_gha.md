Vss. 14-15 are parallel in structure and phraseology, but this does not help as much as we might like. To begin at the beginning, it seems odd to refer to Indra as “one like you” (tvā́vān), and grammatically it is also problematic, because tvā́vant- ordinarily takes a 3rd ps. verb, not 2nd ps. as here. It is tempting to follow Ge’s path and make ab into a subordinate clause (“Wenn einer wie du…”), but this doesn’t work because the initial ā́of pāda a must be construed with the ṛṇóḥ of c. The rest of the first hemistich, two participial phrases, is somewhat awkwardly phrased (at least in translation) but comprehensible: the praisers obtain Indra (or his like) in his own person and implore him for aid, which he provides in c. That pāda uses an idiomatic expression for fitting an axle between two wheels. As the presence of ná in 14c and the structure of vs. 15 show, this expression is a simile, to which some other action of Indra is being compared, even though in 14 there is no obvious frame. The meaning of ā́ṛṇóḥ in the frame is somewhat different from the idiomatic usage, but not, to my mind, the “untranslatable wordplay” that Ge sees. I take it mean ‘fit out’, namely ‘provide’. In 14c I supply ‘refreshments’ from the preceding vs. (13), the first vs. of the tṛca. Nonetheless, this translation of the tṛca, esp. 14-15, strikes me as less than satisfactory.
