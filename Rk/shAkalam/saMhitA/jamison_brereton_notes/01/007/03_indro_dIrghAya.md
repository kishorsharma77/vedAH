A more felicitous tr. of dīrghā́ya cákṣase might be “to be seen for a long time,” but “for the long view” allows the phrase to be read as referring to either time or space (“to be seen for a long distance”) or both.

The usage of the instr. góbhiḥ is somewhat strange; it is clearly not meant either as an instr. of agent/instrument or of accompaniment, at least of simple accompaniment. It might be an instr. of separation, or, as in this tr., an adjunct or accompaniment to the obj.: “the rock (which was) with cows.” ET points out to me that such a construction would be very unusual; I suggest that it could derive from an instr. of accompaniment: “the rock along with its cows.”
