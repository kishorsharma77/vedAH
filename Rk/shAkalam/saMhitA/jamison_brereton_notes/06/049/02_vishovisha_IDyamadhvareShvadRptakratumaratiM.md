The fuller expression in X.3.7 diváspr̥thivyór aratír yuvatyóḥ “the spoked wheel of Heaven and Earth, the youthful ones” makes the identity of “the two youthful ones” clear.

Ge and Re take yájadhyai as a predicated infinitive with unexpressed subject “I” (without comment), with Agni the obj.: “… Agni … will ich verehren”; “je veux lui sacrifier.” I instead supply “(I invoke)” (parallel to stuṣé ‘I will praise’ in 1a) to govern agním, who is then the subject of the inf. Although this involves supplying material, elsewhere in Agni contexts this infinitive is generally used of him, as subject, in his priestly role. Cf., e.g., III.1.1 … mā … váhniṃ cakartha vidáthe yájadhyai “you have made me your draught-horse, to offer the sacrifice at the ritual distribution.” And in this hymn see VI.49.9 hótā yakṣat … agníḥ “the Hotar Agni will sacrifice,” with Agni as agent-subject of the active verb.
