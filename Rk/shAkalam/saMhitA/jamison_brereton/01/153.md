Mitra and Varuṇa
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
4 verses: triṣṭubh
This little collection of Dīrghatamas’s Mitra-Varuṇa hymns (I.151–153), which  have especially concerned their presence at and participation in the sacrifice, ends  with this short piece announcing the present sacrifice offered to the two gods. It  focuses on the ritual details and on the priestly personnel.
## 1
Of one accord we shall sacrifice greatly to you two, o Mitra and Varuṇa,  with oblations, with reverence,
and with ghee, you ghee-backed ones, as when the Adhvaryus among us  bring (soma) to you along with their insights.
## 2
A well-turned preliminary praise song, like the yoking up (of mind), has  been offered to you two, (following) your ordinance, o Mitra and Varuṇa; when the Hotar anoints you at the ritual distributions, the patron is  striving to attain your favor, o bulls.
## 3
Aditi, the milk-cow, swells for truth and for the person who gives  offerings, o Mitra and Varuṇa,
when serving you at the ceremony, he spurs you two on. The one upon  whom the oblation is bestowed [=Agni] is like the human Hotar. 4. When the clans are to be exhilarated, the cows and the goddess Waters  swell the (soma) stalk for you,
and the lord of this house of ours is foremost. Pursue (the rite); drink of  the milk of the ruddy cow.
