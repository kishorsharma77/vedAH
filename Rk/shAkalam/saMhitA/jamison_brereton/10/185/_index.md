Aditi  
Satyadhrti V̥ āruṇi  
3 verses: gāyatrī  
This brief appeal for the help of the three most prominent Ādityas, Mitra, Varuṇa,  and Aryaman, may have been placed here, after the two pregnancy charms, because  it mentions their mother Aditi (vs. 3), whose prodigious pregnancies were legend ary. Certainly the Anukramaṇī seems to have concluded something of the sort, since  it identifies the divinity of the hymn as Aditi, though she appears only obliquely.
