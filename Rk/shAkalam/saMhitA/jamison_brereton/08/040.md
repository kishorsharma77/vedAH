Indra and Agni
Nābhāka Kāṇva
12 verses: mahāpaṅkti, except śakvarī 2 and triṣṭubh 12
Unlike many Indra and Agni hymns, in this one the two divinities achieve some  measure of independence, with the more significant role falling to Indra, who is  mentioned alone in several verses, in part or wholly (2, 5, 6, 9, 10). Much of the  content is martial, appropriate to Indra, and also more appropriate to the Nābhāka  refrain than any other of the Nābhāka hymns. The freeing and winning of the  waters is celebrated several times (vss. 5, 8, 10/11). There are several paired verses: 4  and 5 where Nābhāka is mentioned by name, and 10/11, the first to Indra, the sec
ond, almost identical, to Agni. The hymn ends with a verse in a different meter,  without the refrain, that summarizes the hymn that precedes, as is often the case.
## 1
O Indra and Agni, victorious ones—you two will give us wealth,
by which we might become victorious over the strongholds, even the firm  ones, in the combats,
as Agni (is victorious) over the woods especially when there is wind.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
## 2
For we do not stick you two together in a hole. But we sacrifice to Indra  especially as strongest man among men.
He will come here to us sometime with his steed to win the prize; he will  come here to win wisdom.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
## 3
For these two, Indra and Agni, preside amid battle-raids.
You two, sage poets through your poetic skill, on being asked, realize the  visionary thought for the one seeking your companionship, o men.
– Let all the other squirts burst!

## 4
Like Nabhāka recite to Indra and Agni with a worshipful song, the two to whom this whole moving world belongs,
whose goods this heaven and the great earth bear in their lap.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
## 5
Like Nabhāka, direct sacred formulations to Indra and Agni, the two who opened up the flood with its seven (stream)beds, with its  sloping banks—Indra, showing mastery through his strength.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
## 6
Hew (him) apart in the age-old way, like the tangle of a vine; weaken  the strength of the Dāsa.
Might we then take a share in his goods, brought together by Indra. – Let all the other squirts burst!
## 7
When these peoples here vie in invoking Indra and Agni with song at  length,
with our men might we overcome those doing battle, might we win  against those eager to win.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
## 8
The two bright ones [=sun and moon], who (come) down from heaven  and will proceed upward every day,
(they do so) following the commandment of Indra and Agni; following  the commandment of Indra and Agni the rivers go driving, those  which the two [=Indra and Agni] freed from bondage.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
## 9
Many are your distributions (of goods to us), Indra, and many our  encomia to you, o son of impulsion, possessor of fallow bays—
(many) the infusions of goods of the hero [=Indra], (and many) our  visionary thoughts, which now reach their goal.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
## 10
Hone him [=Indra] with well-twisted (hymns)—the turbulent one, the  “real thing,” worthy of verses.
And he who even now will split the “eggs” of Śuṣṇa with his strength,  he will conquer the waters along with the sun.
– Let all the other squirts burst!
## 11
Hone him [=Agni] affording good ceremonies, the “real thing” really  there at the proper season.
And he who even now is solemnly proclaimed (as the one) who will split  the “eggs” of Śuṣṇa, he has conquered the waters along with the sun. – Let all the other squirts burst!
## 12
Thus to Indra and Agni, in the manner of the ancestors, of Mandhātar,  of Aṅgiras, a newer (speech) has just been spoken.
With tripartite shelter protect us; may we be lords of riches.
