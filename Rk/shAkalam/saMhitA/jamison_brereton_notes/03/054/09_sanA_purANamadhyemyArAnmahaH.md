On the meaning of this vs. see publ. intro. It is the final vs. of the hymnwithin-the hymn, vss. 2-9 dedicated to Heaven and Earth. The 1st ps. poet reappears here; he is first found in vs. 2, the beginning of this self-contained portion, and has been absent since, though he may be related to the 3rd ps. kaví- in vs. 6.

As indicated in the publ. intro., I think this vs. has a double meaning, aided by the double readings of two items in it: ádhi √i, which means both ‘go upon’ (literally) and ‘study’ (‘go over’, figuratively), and the unnamed dyaúḥ, present both as the divinity Heaven alluded to in the phrase in b “great father, begetter” (gen. maháḥ pitúr janitúḥ; for this as a designation of dyaúḥ cf., e.g., I.164.33 dyaúr me pitā́janitā́) and as heaven the place, suggested by the locational adv. yátra ‘where’ in c, introducing the place where the gods take their stand. The poet is both studying the ancient cosmic mysteries he has been attempting to understand in the previous vss.

(esp. 5-6) and is embarking on the path that leads to the place where the gods are established, beyond the ken of mortals. Recall the question in 5b “What is the pathway that leads to the gods?” (devā́m̐áchā pathyā̀kā́sám eti), a question followed by the statement that only the lower seats of the gods are visible. Here purāṇám in pāda a can qualify ‘path’ -- not the fem. pathyā̀in 5b but the more familiar masc.

pánthā-, qualified as purāṇá- in IV.18.1 (cf. also purāṇám ókaḥ ‘ancient home’ in nearby III.58.6, referring to the Aśvins’ dwelling, presumably also heaven). The gods are themselves on a separate path (pathí vyùte d) in the same place, at least by my interpr. Despite their different representations in the (written) Saṃhitā text and in the Pp., vyùta- here and víyuta- in 7a must be the same form, ppl. to ví √yu; in recitation they would be identical. The verb unoti to the supposed root √u to which vyùta- is sometimes referred (see, e.g., Ge n. 9d) is actually also a form of √yu, in the sequence vyùnoti in V.31.1, also meaning ‘separates’. Cf. EWA II.503.
