The vs. lacks a verb, though one can easily be supplied. The standard tr.

supply an imperative: I extract ‘give’ out of vásu-dāvan ‘giving goods’ in 4b, but ‘bring’ (so Ge, Re) works as well. What is clever about the syntax of this vs. is that the only signal of the absent imperative is the presumed 2nd ps. reference of the repeated sá, which of course is ordinarily a 3rd ps. pronoun, but is very frequent with 2nd ps. imperatives (see my “sa figé” article, HS 1992).
