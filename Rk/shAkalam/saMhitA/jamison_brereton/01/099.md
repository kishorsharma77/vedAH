Agni Jātavedas
Kaśyapa Mārīca
1 verse: triṣṭubh
This one-verse hymn is the shortest of the R̥gveda. Embedded in the Kutsa hymns  and placed at the end of his Agni cycle (I.94–98), it is the only hymn attributed to  Kaśyapa Mārīca in Maṇḍala I, though a number of hymns and verses in hymns are ascribed to him elsewhere, especially in Maṇḍala IX. Its message is simple and  straightforward. The imagery of the boat and the river matches that in I.97.7–8.  Both because of this agreement and because the first of Kutsa’s Agni hymns begins  with a praise of Jātavedas, also in the dative case (I.94.1a), this hymn seems well  integrated in the Kutsa cycle.

For Jātavedas we will press soma. He will burn down the property of the  hostile.
He will carry us across all difficult passages, across difficult transits, as if  with a boat across a river—Agni.
