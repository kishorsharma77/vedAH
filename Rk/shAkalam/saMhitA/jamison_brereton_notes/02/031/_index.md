All Gods Ge (/WG) follows Windisch (Fs. Roth) in seeing this hymn as an allegory, with rátha- ‘chariot’ = stóma- ‘praise’ and the solution provided only in the last vs. I find this interpr. overblown. The equation of the hymn / sacrifice with a chariot is a trite trope in the RV; I don’t see that this hymn treats the theme in a special way, but perhaps I’m missing something.
