Ths vs. also contains phonetic echoes of Bṛhaspati: ṛtaspṛ́ś(o) (b) and (vi)rapś(ám) (d). Another phonetic pattern worthy of note, though it doesn’t directly reference Bṛhaspati, is the unbroken sequence of short and long a, starting with yā́in pāda a (right after initial bṛ́haspate) and continuing into pāda b, till right before ṛtaspṛ́śo, the echo of the name: ā a a ā a ā a, a a ā a.

As Ge’s cited parallels make clear, pāda b concerns the Sattra that the Aṅgirases performed.
