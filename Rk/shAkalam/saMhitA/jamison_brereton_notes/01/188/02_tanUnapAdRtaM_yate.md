dádhat is grammatically ambiguous. With most tr. I take it as a masc. nom. sg. act. part. to the redupl. pres., but it could also be a (short-vowel) subjunctive to the same stem (so Old [SBE]). There are no implications either way.

I.188.6-7, 9: These three vss. all contain hí in their first clause, which I render as causal, contra the standard tr.
