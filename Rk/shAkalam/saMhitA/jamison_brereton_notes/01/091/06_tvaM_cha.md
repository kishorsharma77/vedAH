A good example of subordinating ca.

On the use of vánaspáti- ‘lord of the forest’ for soma, see comm. ad IX.12.7.

This usage is found only here and in IX.12.7. Because our phrase priyástotro vánaspátiḥ is almost identical to IX.12.7 nítyastotro vánaspátiḥ, I am now inclined to translate the bahuvr. ‘who has praise as his own’, not ‘to whom praise is dear’.
