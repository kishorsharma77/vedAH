Maruts (1–11), Rudra (12)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
12 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī 1–6, arranged in pragāthas, triṣṭubh 7–8,  gāyatrī 9–11, anuṣṭubh 12
As the variety of meters suggests, this is a composite hymn, with some of the sec tions clearly appended at the end of the Marut sequence. Its length confirms this  analysis, since the previous hymn contained only six verses.
The first six verses consist of three pairs of pragāthas concerning the ritual ser vice offered first to a collection of gods (vs. 1, probably vs. 2) and then particularly  to the Maruts (vss. 3–6) and the benefits that accrue to the sacrificer. Vasiṣṭha names  himself in verse 3. This six-verse sequence conforms to the numerical pattern of the  Marut cycle and could have been original to it. The following two triṣṭubh verses  (7–8) continue the same theme, though more vividly. In particular, in verse 7 the  Maruts are compared to “dark-backed geese,” preening themselves in secret and  then flying here. This may be a reference to how quickly storms can seem to arise,  with thunderclouds fully developed (“preened in secret”).
The last four verses are clearly late additions. They make reference to the  Sākamedha rite encountered also in VII.56.14, the last of the Four-monthly rituals  described in middle Vedic texts. In verse 9 the Maruts are called “descendants of the  scorcher” (sā́ṃtapana), in verse 10 “sharers of the House-offering” (gŕ̥hamedha);  at the Sākamedha the Maruts as Sāṃtapana receive an offering at midday, and in954 VII.59
the evening as Gr̥hamedha. The final verse (12), in a different meter, is dedicated  to “Tryambaka,” an epithet of Rudra. The Sākamedha ends with an oblation to  Rudra Tryambaka.
