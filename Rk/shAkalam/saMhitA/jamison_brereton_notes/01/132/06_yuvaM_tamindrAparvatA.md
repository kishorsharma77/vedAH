The dual dvandva indrā-parvatā ‘Indra and Mountain’ raises the question of the identity of ‘Mountain’; as in III.53.1 I think it is a designation of Indra’s mace (vájra). That the mace shows up in the instr. in the same pāda as the dual verb that has Indra and Parvata as implicit subj. (c vájreṇa … hatam) does not, I think, rule out this interpr.: as “Mountain” the mace is animatized; in the instrumental it is an inanimate instrument.

The tám of pāda a is an anticipatory placeholder for táṃ-tam íd in b, c.

Re and WG take chantsat (√chand) in d as meaning ‘appear’: “there will appear a gáhanam for him …” -- that is, ‘come into view, take shape’. But though ‘appear’ in modern European lgs. can cover that sense, the ‘appear’ sense of √chand is generally ‘have the appearance of, look like’. Ge’s interpr. is more complex: he takes the vájra- to be the underlying subject, which to the fugitive will look like a gáhanam. This interpr. represents the sense of √chand better, but at the cost of producing something close to nonsense, at least as I tried to understand it. I instead use the developed sense ‘be pleasing’ of √chand: the point is that once Indra and Parvata start smiting him, even falling into an abyss will be preferable.
