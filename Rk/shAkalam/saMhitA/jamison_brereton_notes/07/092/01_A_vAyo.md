prá va índrāya mā́danaṃ, háryaśvāya gāyata “Sing forth your exhilarating (song) to Indra of the fallow bays,” though the dat. there is more likely controlled by the verb prá √gā. The connection between Vāyu and √mad is reinforced in the next vs.: 5c vā́yo … mādayasva.

With Old, Re, Thieme (loc. ci.), I take aryáḥ as gen. sg. of arí-, construed with nitóśānāsaḥ, not as nom. pl. with Gr, Ge.

In cd the opt. syāma seems to serve as a modal-establishing auxiliary to the participles ghnántaḥ (c) and sāsahvā́ṃsaḥ (d), perhaps a more economical and less clumsy alternative to two separate optatives (hanyā́ma and sāsahyā́ma) or else a makeshift attempt to express repeated modal action (expressed by my parenthetical “be (always) X-ing”).

In d amítra- seems deliberately positioned verse-final to contrast with aryáḥ, which ends the previous hemistich, and therefore most likely has its full etymological sense -- ‘(one) without alliance (to us)’ -- in opposition to arí-, which identifies members of our larger sociopolitical community, even if unknown to us personally.

Re treats VII.93-94 in EVP XIV, starting p. 55.
