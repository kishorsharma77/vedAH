The juxtaposition of adroghá- ‘undeceptive’ and satyá- ‘real, true’ is also found in III.14.6 adroghéṇa vácasā satyám.

The standard tr. take pādas a and b together, with cd separate. I think it makes more sense to take b with cd, as supplying the reason (Indra’s early soma drinking) that he couldn’t be obstructed.

The standard tr. also take dyā́vaḥ as ‘days’, whereas the publ. tr. agrees with Hoffmann (Injunk. 242) in tr. ‘heavens’. The problem, as I saw it then, was its cooccurrence with áhā likewise ‘days’, which led to awkward duplication. However, I have now rethought this; the series of temporal expressions in this hemistich (áhā, mā́sāḥ śaradaḥ) invites a temporal reading of dyā́vaḥ as well and makes “heavens” seem out of place. In X.7.4. and 12.4 the two stems also co-occur and I tr. “daytimes and days.” I would now substitute that tr. here as well.

varanta here and in 16b is formally ambiguous; it can be either an injunctive or a subjunctive to the root aor. (see Hoffmann 239-40); Hoffmann takes it as a subjunctive. It does not work terribly well as either one; in both passages I tr. it as a preterital modal (“could obstruct”), but this interpr. is not firmly based in the morphology. I sense that in this vs. and the next the poet is struggling to express a verbal category that isn’t found in the Skt. verbal system, namely anteriority: modal anteriority here, temporal anteriority in 10cd.
