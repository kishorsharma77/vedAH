My tr. departs in two ways from the standard. I take prábhūtī as instr. sg. (as it is in IV.54.3), not acc. du., and gavíṣaḥ as gen. sg. with svāpī (also suggested by Ge in his n.), not nom. pl. The pári is somewhat perplexing. Re construes it with prábhūtī (“ô vous qui dominez tout autour,” wrongly as a voc.); my “pervasive preeminence” is a version of this.
