Pāda a lacks a verb. Tr. supply variously: Ge “sich fügen,” Re “ont assigné,” WG “folgen.” I supply a form of √vṛdh ‘strengthen, increase’ on the basis of formulaically similar VIII.15.8 táva dyaúr indra paúṃsyam, prthiv ̥ ī́vardhati śrávaḥ, and other passages where paúṃsyam is obj. of √vrdh ̥ (I.155.3, VIII.6.31).
