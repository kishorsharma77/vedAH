Āprī  
Medhātithi Kāṇva  
12 verses: gāyatrī  
This is the first Āprī hymn to be encountered in the R̥gveda of the ten in the text.  In these hymns, associated with a litany during the Animal Sacrifice, a set series  of subjects or key words (here italicized) is treated verse by verse, in fixed order  but with variable wording. This particular Āprī hymn is a much less elaborated  version than some exemplars of this form; in this hymn the default model verse is  a bare mention of the topic as object of the phrase “I invite” (vss. 3, 7, 8, 10, 12).  Description is minimal and for the most part predictable.
