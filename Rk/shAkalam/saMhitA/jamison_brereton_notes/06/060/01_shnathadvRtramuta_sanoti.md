The vocab. of this vs. shows a slight tendency towards morphological elaboration: in addition to the straightforward sáhastamā sáhasā, there is sáhurī to the same root but with the rare suffix -uri; the deriv. vasavyà- for ‘goods’, rather than standard vásu (as in the preceding hymn VI.59.9). This latter word returns at the end of the hymn.

The 3rd sg. śnáthat that opens the hymn is somewhat puzzling morphologically.

The root √śnath has a poorly attested verbal system, save for the -áya-transitive and associated redupl. aor.; besides śnáthat it consists only of two exx. of the athem.

impv. śnathihi, and a couple of -iṣ-aor. forms. Narten (258-59) argues convincingly that śnathihi should belong to a root aor. (rather than a root pres., as it is generally classed), which could serve as the base for the formation of the -iṣ-aor. Our form śnáthat could formally easily be a subjunctive to this root aor., but the problem is that a subjunctive works quite badly in context, esp., since it is explicitly conjoined (by utá) with the following pres. indic. sanoti. It could alternatively be the injunctive to a them. stem, though in that case it would be the only representative of that stem.

Narten discusses śnáthat in n. 810, where she rather says that though it's used in a general sense, nothing stands in the way of its being a subj. to the root aor. I find this somewhat disingenuous, as subjunctives aren’t generally (/ever?) used in such a sense. She also allows the possibility that it could be injunctive to a thematic stem.

(see also Klein DGRV I.366, who allows either). Much as I dislike multiplying entities, I'm inclined to go for the thematic injunctive for functional reasons.

Unfortunately a root aor. injunc. *śnathīt would have been easy to build, so the thematization cannot be the result of avoiding a problematic form.
