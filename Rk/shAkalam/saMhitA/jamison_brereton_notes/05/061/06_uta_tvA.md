The comparative śáśīyas- is attested only twice in the RV, here and in IV.32.3. Though they have different senses in the two passages (‘more reliable’ here, ‘more numerous’ there, at least by my interpr.), the semantic dev. from the positive śáśvant- ‘regularly recurring, in unbroken sequence, each and every’ to the two senses of the comp. is fairly straightforward. Here, regularly recurring > constant > reliable. In VIII.1.34 this development takes a sexual turn, with a śáśvatī nā́rī being one who is “ever ready” for sex (in my interpr.), and a sexual nuance is not ruled out in our passage either -- though here the emphasis is on her dependable qualities compared to the unsatisfactory man.
