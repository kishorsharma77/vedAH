Ge (followed by Re, WG) takes the feminine plurals as referring to the milk streams, mixing with the soma, here called honey. This of course accords well with the feminine gender, and I agree that this is the first layer of reference. But both the refrain, echoing the refrain of I.80, which has the Maruts as one set of subjects, and sayā́varīḥ ‘fellow travellers, driving along with’ point to the Maruts as a second layer.

The adj. sayā́van- is used 3x (out of 6) with the instr. pl. of devá-, once (X.113.2) quite clearly of the Maruts along with Indra. Why would the hyper-masculine Maruts be referred to with feminines? I think the point is to conflate two of the sources of Indra’s mastery: the soma-milk mixture animatized as cows, which enhances his physical strength, and the Maruts, who provide verbal encouragement and moral support.

I construe instr. vṛ́ṣṇā with sayā́varīḥ rather than with mádanti as most tr. do.

The latter is of course possible.
