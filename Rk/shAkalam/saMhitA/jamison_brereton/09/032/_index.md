Soma Pavamāna  
Śyāvāśva Ātreya  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
Although this hymn begins with the almost ubiquitous journeying forth of the  soma juices (see, e.g., the first verses of IX.10, 17, 20, 24, 29, 30, 31, 33, 34, 41, 44,  all beginning, like this, with prá “forth” followed by a verb of motion somewhere in  the verse), it breaks the pattern of the recent collections of Soma clichés, especially  with the cascade of similes in verses 3–5. This expert handling of the constricted  form of gāyatrī soma hymns may lend credence to the Anukramaṇī’s attribution to  Śyāvāśva Ātreya, the ingenious poet of the Marut cycle in Maṇḍala V.
