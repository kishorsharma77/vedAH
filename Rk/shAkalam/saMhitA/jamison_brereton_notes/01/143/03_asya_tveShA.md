The bahuvrīhi bhā́tvakṣasaḥ in c is generally taken as a gen. sg., modifying Agni, who is amply represented by genitives in b and in the two forms of asyá in a. I prefer to take it as a nom. pl. modifying the beams (bhānávaḥ) that remain the subject of the sentence. However, either interpr. is possible.

The rest of pāda c presents other difficulties: it contains two apparent nominatives, sg. aktúḥ and pl. síndhavaḥ, both apparently part of the same simile.

Moreover the prep./prev. áti has nothing to govern or construe with. Old allows an emendation to acc. pl. *aktū́n, producing the prep. phrase áti *aktū́n “across the nights,” which produces good sense. Ge refines this by suggesting that there is really a word haplology from *áty aktúm aktúr, with aktúr and síndhavaḥ forming what he calls elsewhere a loose karmadhāraya, tr. “gleich dem Farbenspiel der Flüsse” (sim.

Re “comme la surface-ointe (des) fleuves”). Since both also render the haplologized

*aktúm/aktū́n as ‘night(s)’, they are also silently assuming a pun on aktú-, both ‘night’
and a derivative of √añj ‘anoint, adorn’. My interpr. also assumes a haplology of

*aktū́n (or aktúm), in order to account for the áti, which several times appears with
an acc. of a word for ‘night’ (VI.4.5 … áty ety aktū́n; cf. also áty aktúbhiḥ with instr.

I.36.16; with acc. pl. kṣapáḥ VIII.26.3, X.77.2). For aktúḥ, however, I suggest very tentatively that we are dealing with a gen. sg. to a (pseudo-)-(t)ar-stem to the ‘night’ word (see Nomen in idg. Lex. 505 for a few apparent r-stem forms elsewhere) -- hence, “the rivers of the night.” If this morphological suggestion seems too radical, the “loose karmadhāraya” interpr. of two nominatives might produce the same effect.

In any case, the expression is reminiscent of the curious phrase aktúr apā́m “the ‘night’ of the waters” in II.30.1.
