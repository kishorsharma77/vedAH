The annunciatory ayáṃ sá hótā “here he is, the Hotar …” opening the verse is a typical final-verse signal of the epiphany of a god. Because Agni is on the ritual ground already, he doesn’t usually have an epiphany, but this phrase may indicate here the first sight of the kindled fire. The effect is particularly noticeable here because vs. 5 repeats some of the key portions of vs. 4: (4 … dvijánmā …, víśvā … / hótā …; 5 … hótā … dvijánmā, víśvā).
