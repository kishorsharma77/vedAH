The very powerful Indra has penetrated the battling hosts. The many  (hosts) marshal themselves for him, for his comradeship.  
Mount upon the hosts like a chariot that you will spur on with  
auspicious benevolence.  
Hymns X.30–34 are attributed to Kavaṣa Ailūṣa, though Oldenberg (1888: 234–35)  entertains the possibility that this group should be joined with the Vasukra hymns  that precede on the basis of shared phraseology.
