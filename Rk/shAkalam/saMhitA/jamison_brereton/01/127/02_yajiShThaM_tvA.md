We sacrificers would invoke you as best sacrificer, the oldest of the  Aṅgirases, o poet, with our thoughts—(invoke you) through our poets,  o glowing one, with our thoughts—  
(you) like earth-encircling heaven, the Hotar of the settled domains, the flame-haired bull whom these clans (help)—let the clans help (him)  to speed.
