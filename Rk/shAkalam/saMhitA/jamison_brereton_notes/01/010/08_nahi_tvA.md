jéṣaḥ: The standard translation take this s-aor. subj. as a functional impv.

parallel to dhūnuhi in d, whereas I take it as having real subjunctive value. This has the merit of providing a main clause to the subordinated hí clause of ab. Moreover, the otherwise identical pāda VIII.40.10 with 3rd sg. subj. jéṣat has clear subjunctive value, and in addition there is already a well-attested “-si imperative” jéṣi (7x) that fills that function for the s-aor., so it seems unlikely that jéṣaḥ would be so used.
