An intricate verse, in which Indra both officiates as a singer at the sacrifice and receives the sacrifice as his due. In pāda a Indra as bull is, by the standard accounts, the subject, chanting along with the hard-laboring human priests (for svédu-havya-, see Jamison 2015, BAI 25) and, in his fervor, eager to out-sing (áti … juguryā́t) them. This is the only occurrence of áti with this root, but it can hardly mean anything else.

The Hotar in pāda c is most likely not Indra, but Agni, as in the next verse.

This identification makes it easier to interpret the last pāda, where Indra, here called a “young blood” (máryaḥ), supports “the pair,” who are likely (Ge’s parallels are apposite here) the two priests Udgātar (the likely subj. of gā́yat in 1a) and Hotar (2c).
