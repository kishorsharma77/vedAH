Aśvins  
Dyumnīka Vāsiṣṭha or Priyamedha Āṅgirasa or Krṣ̥ ṇa Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī arranged in pragāthas  
A typical and rather banal Aśvin hymn, with the simple message “come here, drink  the soma, give us aid and goods,” although there are a few striking images, espe cially in verse 1.  
As Oldenberg (1888: 217) points out, this six-verse hymn, following a five-verse  hymn, violates the proper order, but, as he also points out, the first two pragāthas  are parallel in structure and phraseology, and may well form one four-verse hymn,  with the final pragātha (vss. 5–6) an originally separate hymn. Detaching the last  verses would restore an acceptable order, with a five-verse hymn (86), followed by  four- and two-verse hymns.
