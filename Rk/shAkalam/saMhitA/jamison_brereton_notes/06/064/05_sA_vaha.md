The beginning of the first pāda, sā́ā́[so Pp., Saṃhitā sā́] vaha yā́, replicates almost exactly the beginning of 4c, sā́na ā́vaha. The close similarity of the two openings supports the disjoining of sā́in 5a into sā́ā́, which is also required by the meter.

As noted above, nom. sg. fem. ávātā ‘unvanquished, unsurpassable’ plays on the loc. avāté ‘windless’ in 4b. The neg. stem ávāta- is generally paired with the positive pres. part. vanván, in the phrase vanvánn ávātaḥ “winning but unwon” (5x, incl. VI.16.20, 18.1 in this maṇḍala). But here and in nearby VI.67.8 it is found in the fem. and outside of the contrastive pair. In neither of these passages is the application of the adjective clear. I have therefore, somewhat reluctantly, adopted a version of Re’s attenuated ‘insurpassable’ (which, however, he seems to reject in his n.).

Both Ge and Re take cd as a unified rel. cl. (e.g., “die du als Göttin ...

erschienen bist”), but this is impossible, because bhūḥ is unaccented. I instead attach c to ab, and take d as an independent imperatival clause. I now see that it would be possible to take cd together, with the nominal rel. cl. yā́ha devī́acting as an izafe; as noted elsewhere (passim) such izafe-like rel. phrases can be embedded. This would produce a tr. “You, who are a goddess, o daughter of heaven, become worthy to be seen …,” with no appreciable difference in meaning. It might then be better to stick with the arrangement of the publ. tr.
