The sequence ékasya … dváyoḥ … / utédṛśe yáthā vayám “of one, of two and for such as we are” is a nice example of Behagel’s Law. It also shows variant syntax in a conjoined construction, since the third conjoined member is dative (ī́dṛśe), while the first two are gen. (unless dváyoḥ is loc., which seems unlikely). The result, at least in translation, is almost awkward, but the formal switch in case (and number) has semantic consequences, in my opinon. The sequence first presents itself as a purely numerical one (cf. Klein DGRV I.332-33), and we might expect “of one, of two, and *of however many we are.” But the sg. ī́dṛśe changes the focus from the quantity of the beneficiaries to their quality (“such as we,” in implicit contrast to people outside our circle of lesser value), and the dative emphasizes the benefactive nature of Indra’s actions. Ge’s “auch für einen solchen, wie wir sind” misses the point, in my view.
