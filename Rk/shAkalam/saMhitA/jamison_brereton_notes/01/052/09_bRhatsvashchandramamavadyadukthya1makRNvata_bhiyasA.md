Another puzzling verse, and my interpretation is accordingly not at all certain.

I take the first pāda, couched in the neuter, to refer to the sun (n. svàr-), the placing of which in heaven (as m. sū́ryam) was Indra’s last act in vs. 7. In the 2nd pāda the subjects of ákṛṇvata (note the middle, which should have self-beneficial force) make this sun into their own means of getting to heaven. As an -ana-nominal, róhana- (only here) should have transitive-causative force.

However, I think there is more going on here, for in the 2nd hemistich Indra is identified as the sun (n. svàr), while his helpers, the Maruts, are associated with humans, the descendents of Manu (mā́nuṣa-), and their activities. If Indra is the sun, then the sun of pāda a, which the Maruts/gods used to get themselves to heaven in pāda b, may well be Indra. For this identification note the -(ś)candra- reminiscent of Indra’s candra- in 3b, and in 6a the glowing heat surrounding Indra and his flaring power seem to depict something very like a solar Indra. The Maruts’ aid to Indra in the Vṛtra battle (4c, where they are called ūtáyaḥ as here) stood them in good stead, enabling them to bridge the distance between the human world and heaven by hitching their wagon to a star (=sun, =Indra).

I do not quite understand the bhíyasā of b, though it obviously must be considered in connection with the same word in the same metrical position in the b pāda of the next verse. I assume it refers here to the awe- and fear-inspiring aspects of Indra in his celestial form.
