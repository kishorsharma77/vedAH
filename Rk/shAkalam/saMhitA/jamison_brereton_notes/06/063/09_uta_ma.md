Although in the publ. tr. I accept Ge’s interpr. of pakvā́as ‘cooked (food)’ (so also Gr, Hoffmann [231], Klein [DGRV I.97], Scar [587]), in this mass of valuable livestock I now find it unlikely that the poet would memorialize for posterity the gift of a few ready-prepared meals. It is more likely to be a technical term in animal husbandry -- perhaps ‘mature(d)’ (< ‘ripened’), qualifying horses or cattle of a particular age. Although it is neut. pl. and therefore can’t qualify the animals directly, I suggest that parallel to sg. śatám in the conjoined phrase sumīḷhé śatám peruké ca pakvā́, we may supply *śatā́(ni) *gávām pakvā́“mature hundreds of cows” for “*hundreds of mature cows.” A similar constr. seems to be suggested by Gr (Nachtr. to śatá-), where he proposes that pakvā́be construed with śatám as an ex. of his 10) “der Singular neben einem in gleichem Casus stehenden Substantiv des Plurals.” Although this particular interpr. seems precluded by the ca in the passage, I do think the neut. pakvā́qualifies a (gapped) neut. numeral. I would now alter the tr.

to “and (hundreds) of mature (cows) at (the hands of) Peruka.” Hoffmann (230-31) interprets the two clauses in the 2nd hemistich as modal, with injunc. dāt rendered as ‘soll … schenken’ and the sandhi form abhiṣā́ca interpr.

as an inf. *abhiṣā́ce with the sense “soll … folge.” This is all in service of his somewhat bizarre insistence that the injunctive aorist doesn’t express immediate past tense (aktuelle Vergangenheit), which is, in his view, the province of the augmented aorist. At least in my view, Hoffmann’s restricted and often non-linguistically grounded model of the injunctive has led him to deny the obvious intent of the dānastuti here: the gift generally needs to have been given to be praised! As for the supposed infinitive *abhiṣā́ce (which, it must be admitted, he does not insist on), there are no other such forms, whereas the nom. pl. is attested elsewhere. We must simply accept that it takes verbal rection, here the acc. pl. ṛṣvā́n; see Scar (587-88).
