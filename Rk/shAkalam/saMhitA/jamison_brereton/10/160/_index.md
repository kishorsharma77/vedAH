Indra
Purāṇa Vāiśvāmitra
5 verses: triṣṭubh
A straightforward invitation to soma-drinking, also expressing the usual fear that  Indra will attend another sacrifice (vs. 1) and the usual smug awareness that a non presser will be punished (vs. 4). According to the Anukramaṇī, the poet is a descen dant of the Viśvāmitras, and the last two words of the hymn, śunáṃ huvema “for  blessing we would invoke” are the first two words of the Viśvāmitra clan refrain,  found in most of the Viśvāmitra triṣṭubh Indra hymns (III.30.22, etc.).
