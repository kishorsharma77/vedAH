The simile hitā́iva is compared by Ge and Re with a similar expression in IV.57.1, with the meaning “good (friends)” (Ge “wie gute (Freunde)”) or, more technically, “like contracted (allies)” (see the bahuvrīhi hitá-mitra-). This doesn’t mean much in the context here. WG are somewhat skeptical, but simply tr. literally “wie die Hingesetzten” without explaining what that might mean here. Both the Ge/Re and the WG tr. assume a ppl. to √dhā ‘set, establish’. I take it rather to √hi ‘impel’ (as does Gr) and assume that the underlying subject is horses and that the image is of horses led out to piss before contests. See esp. I.64.6 (also a Marut hymn) átyaṃ ná mihé ví nayanti vājínam “They lead (their horse) out to piss like a prizeseeking steed” (also cf. II.34.13, IX.74.4). This image fits well with the sprinkling here.
