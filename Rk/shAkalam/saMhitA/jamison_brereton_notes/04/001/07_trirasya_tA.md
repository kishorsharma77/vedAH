I take santi satyā́here as an etym. figure, a phrasal verb meaning “come into existence” (“come [to be] true”), rather than taking santi as copula and satyā́as a simple adj. with most tr. For one thing, pres. tense forms of √as in main clauses are usually existentials, not copulas; for another trís should mean ‘three times’, not ‘three’ or ‘threefold’ as a copular reading seems to require (e.g., Ge “Dreifach sind diese seine höchsten wahren (Geburten) …”). See also satyám astu in 18d. I am not sure which three occasions are being referred to, but possibly to the production of the three ritual fires -- though esp. given the word paramá- ‘highest’, it could be a cosmic reference.

I do not know what “enveloped within the limitless” (ananté antáḥ párivītaḥ) refers to. It may be the dense swirling smoke, lacking clear boundaries, that surrounds a fire, or it may be the unborn Agni’s concealment in the kindling sticks -- though it’s hard to see how they would be anantá-. It is also possible that this is a reference to the paridhi sticks that surround the ritual fire (see comm. ad IV.3.2 below); they would be “endless” because a circle has no end. Note the phonological play of (an)anté antáḥ, despite their different etymological affiliations.

In d the standard tr. take ari yáḥ as nom. sg. to the thematic stem aryá- (e.g., Ge ‘Herr’). I follow Thieme (Fremdling, 77-78) in interpr. it as gen. sg. to arí-.

Among other things, as Gr points out, this would be the only ex. of aryá- with distraction, while arí- does have a few other distracted forms. There is no compelling formulaic evidence either way, but V.34.9 ketúm aryáḥ “the beacon for the stranger,” adduced by Thieme, resembles our passage thematically.
