It is a curious, but perhaps coincidental, fact that the sole occurrence of daṇḍá- in the RV is found in the same hymn with the only occurrence of the vṛddhi deriv. maitrāvaruṇá- (vs. 11), given that the daṇḍa- ‘staff’ is the emblem of office associated with the Maitrāvaruṇa priest in śrauta ritual. See Minkowski, Priesthood in Ancient India, pp. 141-54 and passim. The conjunction in our hymn was pointed out to me by Elizabeth Tucker.

The addition of the pejorative and sometimes diminutive suffix -ka- on a word already meaning ‘small’ -- arbha-ká- -- is a nice slangy touch.

In c the ca appears to be subordinating (so also Klein, DGRV I.242-43), though because ábhavat is pāda-initial, its accent need not be due to subordination.
