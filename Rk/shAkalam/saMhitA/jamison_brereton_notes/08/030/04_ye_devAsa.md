Ge takes víśve vaiśvānarā́utá as “and all the Vaiśvānaras” (so also Klein, DGRV), but it is the gods who are vaiśvānará-, as Ge clearly states in his n. 4b.

(Interestingly, this is the only pl. form of this stem, which otherwise, save for one passage [IX.61.16, referring to light], is used only of Agni.) The terms that are being conjoined are ihá ‘here’ and ‘belonging to all men’, not gods and Vaiśvānaras; the point is that they are here and available to us because they belong to all of us. There is also complementary contrast between “all gods” and “(belonging) to all men,” and the víśve of the former phrase has been postponed so that it can adjoin the latter: devāsaḥ …, víśve vaiśvānarā́ḥ.
