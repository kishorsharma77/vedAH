The transition between the All God portion of the hymn and the dānastuti is eased by verbal repetition: Mitra and Varuṇa, who were the last gods invoked (6ab), are again called on here, though in opposite order and not in a dvandva but in individual vocatives (varuṇa mitra versus 6a mitrāvaruṇā). Independent rātíḥ picks up the 2nd cmpd member in śrótu-rātiḥ (6c) and the PN śrutáratha- (7c) also echoes śrótu-rātiḥ.

The locc. pajré / śrutárathe priyárathe mark these men as givers, which makes some trouble, since Kakṣīvant’s family seems to be called Pajra (quite possibly in the next verse and in I.126.4-5) and Kakṣīvant himself pajriyá- (I.116.7, 117.6, 120.5). Nonetheless, grammar can’t be gainsaid, and they must be patrons here. See Ge’s n. 7bc for attempts to reconcile the discrepancies.
