The lack of accent on the demon. in the phrase asya rāyáḥ is notable. Ge tr.

“um solche Reichtum,” clearly taking asya as modifying rāyáḥ, and Old (ZDMG 61.828 [=KlSch 259]) defends a similar interpr., saying “der weitere Verlauf schildert dann den Reichtum ausführlicher.” However, unaccented oblique stems of ayám are ordinarily pronominal, and that interpr. is readily available here: the asya can refer to Indra, who immediately precedes in a different case (índram).

On the yáḥ of pāda c as breaking the pattern established earlier in the hymn of reference to Indra, see the publ. intro.
