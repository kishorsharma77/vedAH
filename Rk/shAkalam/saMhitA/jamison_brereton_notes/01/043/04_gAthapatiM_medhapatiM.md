jálāṣa- is “of unclear meaning” (so EWA s.v.) and shows non-Indo-Aryan phonology. In the RV it occurs twice independently and twice in this compound jálāṣabheṣaja- (and one of its independent occurrences is adjacent to bheṣajá-), always in association with Rudra. The translation ‘healing’ (see also Kuiper, Aryans 25-26, 46) therefore makes contextual sense, despite the lack of etymological support.
