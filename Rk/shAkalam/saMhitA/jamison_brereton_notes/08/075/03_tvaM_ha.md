The pleonastically suffixed yáviṣṭhi ya- beside the regular splv. yáviṣṭhaowes its suffix entirely to metrical considerations. All 15 occurrences of the stem are pāda-final in a Jagatī or dimeter line and thus provide a text-book iambic cadence.

The unextended yáviṣṭha- is not as rigidly placed, but is still often pāda-final in a Triṣṭubh cadence.
