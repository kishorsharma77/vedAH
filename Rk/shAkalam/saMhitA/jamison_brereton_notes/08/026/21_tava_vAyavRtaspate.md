The voc. ṛtaspate, belonging to a hapax cmpd., has an unusual 1st member for a thematic stem. We should expect *ṛtapate. But to construct that form is to confront its problem, a sequence of light syllables (4 in stem form). Rather than seeing anything archaic in the form we have, I think it likely that the cmpd was shaped in analogy to the numerous gen. -as-páti- with athem. gen., esp. bṛ́has-pátiwith similar phonological shape. See also ráthas-páti-, which shows the same anomaly as ṛtaspate: comm. ad V.50.5. Unlike ráthas-páti-, the form here makes no metrical problems.
