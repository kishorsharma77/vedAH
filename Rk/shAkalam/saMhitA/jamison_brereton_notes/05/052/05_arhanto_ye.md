This is the vs. in which the problematic instr. of 1b is resolved -- “repaired” -

- but, as discussed in my 2006 paper, the poet produces a new conundrum, though
this one can be, as it were, pre-repaired. The obj. yajñám ‘sacrifice’ is unexpected with the verb prá … arcā ‘chant forth’; we expect a verbal product as object. But the yajñám here is picking up the conjoined phrase stómaṃ yajñáṃ ca of 4b, whose stómam would be an appropriate obj. of prá … arcā.
