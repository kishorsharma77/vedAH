Dawn
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This little hymn is dense with phonetic figures and puns, and like the preceding  hymn has signature words—in this case the preverb ví “apart, widely” and the pho nologically similar verbal roots vas “dawn” and vR̥(var) “(un)cover.”
Like many Dawn hymns, this one gives the opening of the Vala cave and the  release of the cows imprisoned therein as the mythic model for each new dawn (see  esp. vs. 4). Dawn’s association with the distribution of goods is also emphasized in  the last three verses.
