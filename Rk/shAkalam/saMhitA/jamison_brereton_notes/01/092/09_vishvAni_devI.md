Unfortunately it is not possible to render the three fronted forms of víśva- (pādas a, c, d) in non-awkward English.

cákṣuḥ in b can be either nom. or acc. Most tr. take it as the latter, with Dawn facing either the eye(s) of, presumably, humans (so Ge [/WG], Re) or the eye of the sun (so Macdonell [Hymns from the Rigveda], Maurer). The latter is unlikely on pragmatic grounds: although the eye of the sun is a standard trope in the RV (see in fact 11d), the sun rises after dawn, and Dawn surely wouldn’t be looking behind her, to the east. The former is certainly possible, but I prefer to take cákṣuḥ as nominative, referring to Dawn as an eye, since she has just been said to oversee (abhicákṣyā) all creatures.

I’m not entirely sure what pāda d refers to, but perhaps it means that by dawning she has stimulated ritual speech and therefore “finds” it.
