This vs. has ties to earlier parts of the hymn. The opening tád vaḥ … mahitvanám “this is your greatness” echoes 1ab tán nú vocāma … mahitvám. There it was their previous (pū́rvam) greatness; this vs. presumably brings this greatness into the present time.

Pāda b seems a paraphrase of 7a anavabhrárādhasaḥ ‘whose gifts are not withdrawn’.

The connection between the main clause and the relative clause in cd is somewhat loose: as a correlative to the rel. cl. jánāya yásmai “for whatever person” we would expect tám, not tád, which must refer to the gift, not the recipient of it.
