The first hemistich, couched in the 1st ps., consists only of a rel. clause, which breaks off. The “I” is clearly Viśvāmitra, whose name opens the hemistich and whose protective bráhman- is mentioned there -- making it very likely that pādas ab constitute this bráhman-, though it’s not quite clear what is protective about this truncated utterance.

The plupf. átuṣṭavam should not exist, at least in my opinion, since the two forms of the indicative pf. tuṣṭuvúḥ (VIII.6.12, 18) also appear to have preterital value. However, the contexts in VIII.6 do not guarantee that value -- it is possible that they are presential “they praise” (see comm. ad VIII.6.12). The existence of a pf.

subj. tuṣṭávat at VIII.98.16 also suggests that the indicative pf. is, or originally was, presential. The only other pf. forms in the RV, the act. part. tuṣṭuváṃs- (3x) and mid.

part. tuṣṭuvāná- (1x) are generally tr. as preterital, but again context does not dictate this rendering.
