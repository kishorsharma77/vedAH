The contrastive anyáḥ … anyáḥ is generally taken to refer to Soma (a) and Pūṣan (b) respectively (Ge [/WG], Re). But the differential characterizations in this vs. seem even less easily assigned than in the preceding vs. “Begetting all creaures” isn’t a standard action attributed to Soma; in fact the same deed is said to be Apām Napāt’s in nearby II.35.2. And Ge can attribute “watching over everything” to Pūṣan only by identifying him with the sun god, while Soma regularly gazes on things, even with the same participle: cf. the very similar IX.57.2 víśvā cákṣāṇo arṣati “he [=Soma] rushes gazing on all (things/beings).” Again I think this differentiation is meant to be genuinely puzzling and provoke thought in the audience.
