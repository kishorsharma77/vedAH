HvN split the hemistich between vā́jam and árvatā, producing two pādas of 11 syllables each. But since the b pāda then has a bad cadence and since the pāda, minus initial árvatā, is found also at I.40.4, where the iambic cadence is fine in a dimeter line, it seems best to follow the standard view that árvatā belongs with pāda a, which is then hypermetric (so Old).

The famous formula “imperishable fame” (ákṣiti śrávaḥ) ends the second pāda.
