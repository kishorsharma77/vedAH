Agni  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: dvipadā triṣṭubh  
Quite reasonably, Oldenberg holds that this hymn, the last of the Agni hymns of  VII, is an addition to the original collection. It is a general description of the prepa rations for the sacrifice (vss. 1, 2), its performance (vss. 3, 4), and its rewards (vs.  5). The last two verses reaffirm the relationship of Agni to the gods (vs. 6) and to  mortals (vs. 7).
