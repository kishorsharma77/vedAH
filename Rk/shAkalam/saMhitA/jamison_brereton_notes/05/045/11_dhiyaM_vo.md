Most interpr. construe apsú with dadhiṣe and tr. the latter as ‘you have placed’, hence “you have placed your dhī́in the waters.” But med. forms of √dhā generally mean ‘acquire, assume’, and furthermore the standard interpr. is either nonsensical or requires a substantial backstory -- such as Old’s “[ein] Zauber für Wiedererscheinen der Sonne nach langen Regengüssen.” I follow Ge in taking apsú with svarṣā́m “das … die Sonne im Wasser gewinnt”; the sun was manifestly in the water(s) in the immediately preceding vs. -- however metaphorically we wish to interpret those waters (I would take them as the floods of dawn light we encountered in vs. 2). Thus “winning the sun in the waters” is simply an expression for causing the sun to rise at dawn. For further disc. on the place of this vs. in the hymn, see publ.

intro.

The number discrepancy between 2nd pl. vaḥ and 2nd sg. dadhiṣe is easily accounted for in the same general manner as the vaḥ in vs. 4 (see comm. thereon): dadhiṣe is the poet’s self-address to himself, while vaḥ is addressed to his colleagues.

As in vss. 5-6, these two distinct 2nd ps. references are joined in a joint 1st pl. in cd (syāma … tuturyāma).
