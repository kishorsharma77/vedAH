It is not clear whether te pūrtám refers to a gift given to Agni or by him.

The publ. tr. takes it in the former sense, assuming that our gift to Agni will trigger his own actions for us in pāda c, in the standard reciprocal model of Vedic sacrifice.

Scar (293), in keeping with his interpr. of nemānām (see below), also thinks it’s a gift to Agni, but from others (“was [dir von anderen] geschenkt wird”). Re (see esp. his n.

expanding his tr.) takes it as Agni’s gift to us, and I interpr. Ge’s “deine Schenkung” in the same fashion. In fact, either interpr. is possible, and the choice will be influenced by one’s interpr. of pāda c.

The stem néma-, cognate to Aves. naēma- ‘half’, is implicitly oppositional, picking out one moiety or side, or simply “some” out of a larger group. Here the unaccented gen. pl. nemānām, part of the voc. phrase headed by vaso, refers, in my view, to our side. This is clearly Ge’s view because he footnotes his slightly awk.

“du Gott der einen Partei” with “Der Fromme oder Arier.” Other renderings are so awkward as to be almost unintelligible: Re “o Vasu, (dieu) de quelques-uns,” Klein (DGRV II.71) “o Vasu of some (races).” And Scar (293) takes it as referring to the opposition (“o du Vasu der andere”), which then requires Agni to do some amends- making in pāda c. I consider it extremely unlikely that the poet would address Agni, the focus of his praise, as a god of just some people, diluting his power and denying his omnipresence -- much less as a god of others. I might, however, slightly modify the publ. tr. from “on (our) side” to “of (our) side.” At first glance pāda c, átho dúvo vanavase, with its middle voice seems to involve Agni’s winning dúvas- for himself. This would be compatible with the Ge/Re interpr. of pāda a: if Agni gives us a not insignificant gift in pāda a, he has a good chance of winning our dúvas- in c. However, the almost identical expression in the immediately preceding hymn, VI.15.6d devó devéṣu vánate hí no dúvaḥ “for the god will win friendship for us among the gods,” with the crucial loc. devéṣu and dat. of benefit naḥ, suggests that Agni is winning something on our behalf. Cf. also, in this hymn, VI.16.28 agnír no vanate rayím “Agni will win us wealth.” The root √van ‘win’ is strongly represented in this hymn, esp. in the middle section. Here we have vanavase; elsewhere vanvánn ávātaḥ 20, vanván 26, vanvántaḥ 27, vanate 28, as well as vivāsasi 12. This repetition cuts across tṛca boundaries.
