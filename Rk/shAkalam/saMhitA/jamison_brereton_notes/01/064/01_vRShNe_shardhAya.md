Ge argues that apó (apparently the acc. pl. of ‘waters') should be emended to ápo (neut. acc. sg. of ‘work’). His parallels are persuasive, and I accept the emendation. Therefore the published tr. should have an asterisk * before ‘work’. The accent shift may have been made redactionally, on the basis of vs. 6, which contains apó ‘waters’ in its first pāda and vidátheṣv ābhúvaḥ in its second, as here. On the other hand, if we choose to retain the reading apó (see below), the hemistich can mean “Wise in mind, with dextrous hands I anoint the hymns, like waters standing ready at the rites.” WG accept the reading as given, but take it as “Werkmeister,” i.e., to the internally derived adjectival stem apás- ‘possessing work’. This would be appealing save for the fact that the masc. nom. sg. should be *apā́s (or ápā in this sandhi context). This morphological problem is not mentioned.
