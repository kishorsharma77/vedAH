The doubled nū́nú ‘now now, just now’ is found only here, though doubling with an intercalated particle is found (nū́cin nú I.120.2, VI.37.3, VII.22.8). It is possible that the sequence nū́nú vām is meant to evoke a form of √nu ‘bellow, shout’, in this verse concerning the poet’s praise of the gods. Various forms of song and so forth serve as subjects of √nu. Cf. nearby I.6.6, 7.1.
