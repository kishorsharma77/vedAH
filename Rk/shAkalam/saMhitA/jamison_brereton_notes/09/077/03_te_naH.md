Both Ge and Re take pū́rvāsa úparāsaḥ as temporal designations: the earlier and later drops. If so, it is hard to understand how we can order both types (esp. the earlier ones, which should be beyond our control) to run. I prefer to see them as spatial. For such a usage cf. V.31.11 pū́rvaṃ karad úparam “(what is) in front ... he will put behind.” As has long been known (see Old, citing Barth., as well as EWA s.v.), ahī́- is etymologically identical to Aves. azī (OA, YA), which characterizes cows - contra Gr’s ‘Schlange’. It’s not clear to me why Ge and Re seem so uncertain about it, esp.

as Ge cites Aves. azī in n. 3c.
