The adj. dhitā́van- is not entirely clear. It is a possessive -van-stem to the ppl.

dhitá- (√dhā); as Debrunner points out (AiG II.2.560), it unusually preserves the dh- that is found in this ppl. only as 2nd member of a cmpd or under certain sandhi conditions. The final has been lengthened as is normal in these stems: in the RV only maghávan- has a short final vowel before the -van-suffix. Cf. also the numerous -āvant-formations in the previous hymn (III.39.4, 6, 8). But what does it mean? The form occurs only here and in III.27.2, modifying Agni. Gr (flg. BR) glosses it as ‘gabenreich’, Ge “der das Erwartete (?) bringt,” whose connection to √dhā I don’t understand. Both Re’s “pourvu (d’offrandes) présentées” and WG’s “das Vorrat habend” may be closer to the mark. But what is most characteristically hitá- at the sacrifice is the ritual fire, ā́√dhā being the technical term of establishing that fire, and I therefore suggest that the sacrifice with its fires established is at issue here.

Some support for this interpr. may come from the last phrase stavāna viśpate “o you who are praised as clan-lord.” The epithet viśpáti- is ordinarily used of Agni, so Indra is here being praised as Agni, and it is Agni who both is and oversees the ritual fires.
