This vs. contains several striking paradoxes, once they have been “unpacked.” First, “the sea has been groomed in the waters,” which seems to reverse volume relations: we would expect “the sea” (samudrá-) to be more larger and more extensive than the waters, but evidently the former can be contained and “groomed” (māmṛje) in the latter. The “sea” is of course soma, which is presumably so called on the basis of the usual aggrandizement of Soma’s cosmic associations.

Then, without transition, soma goes from being “the sea” to “the prop and buttress of heaven” -- that is, from something fluid, unstable, and in constant motion to its exact opposite: solid, fixed, steady enough to support heaven itself. Another paradox and another indication that Soma’s cosmic ambitions cannot be contained.

It is tempting to supply “earth” in b, on the basis of IX.87.2 = 89.6 viṣtambhó divó dharúṇaḥ pṛthivyā́ḥ: “the prop of heaven and buttress of the earth,” but perhaps it is better to stick with the text as we have it.

After the two cosmic identifications in a and b, in c we return to the focused reality of the ritual: the soma in the filter -- the usual toggling between the universal and the hyperparticular.
