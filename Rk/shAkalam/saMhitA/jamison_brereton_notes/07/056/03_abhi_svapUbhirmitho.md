This vs. continues the theme of mutuality in vs. 2, but now concerns the Maruts’ adult behavior as gods of the storm. The mutuality is expressed both by the adv. mitháḥ repeated from vs. 2 and by the reciprocal 3rd pl. verb aspṛdhran “they contended with each other.” The hapax svapū́- has been variously, and surprisingly, interpr. See Old ad loc. (also KEWA s.v., etc.) for the numerous suggestions, incl. BR ‘broom’, Lanman ‘wings’. However, the most obvious analysis also is most likely the correct one, as a root noun cmpd. to root √pū ‘purify’, hence ‘self-purifying’. This is Old’s conclusion, reflected also in Ge’s and Re’s tr. and in Scar (323). Perhaps the resistance to this obvious interpr. resulted from the fact that it is a hapax -- astonishing given the centrality of Soma Pavamāna “self-purifying Soma” in RVic ritual as the subject of the entire IXth Maṇḍala -- and in this passage it has no connection with soma. Here it quite likely refers to the rain drops accompanying the Maruts’ storm, as Ge suggests.

Old acutely notes that the verb in this pāda vapanta resembles pavanta ‘they purify(/ied) themselves’. Rather than considering vapanta a corruption of pavanta (which seems extremely unlikely to me), I would instead suggest that it’s a metathetic word play (vap ≈ pav), aided by preceding (s)vap(ū́bhiḥ).
