Maruts
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
8 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 7–8
Like V.56, this hymn begins with an invocation of Agni, the ritual fire, who is also  conspicuously addressed along with the Maruts in each of the last three verses  (6–8). The prominence of Agni identifies the Maruts’ journey to and participation  in the sacrifice as the goal of the hymn. Their journey itself provokes the usual  cosmic reactions—fear and trembling (vss. 2–3)—and the dazzling beauty of the  Maruts also receives its usual expression (vs. 4). Verse 5 provides an almost domes
tic picture of their parentage. Notable also is the dicing imagery in verse 1.
