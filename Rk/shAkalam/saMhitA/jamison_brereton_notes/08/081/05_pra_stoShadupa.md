Ge suggests that the verbs in pāda a (prá stoṣat and úpa gāsiṣat respectively) show that Indra is acting as Prastotar (the first assistant to the Udgātar, responsible for chanting the prastāva) and Upagātar (subordinate chanter, at least four of whom sing "ho" continuously in a low tone), priestly titles not found in the ṚV, though their functions may be. Both roles would connect him with the Sāma Veda, as does his listening to the sāman in pāda b. Old thinks rather that the priest is the subject of pāda a, but this seems unlikely in this strong Indra context.
