The first two pādas show a nice syntactic conversion: the 2nd member śávasof the voc. bahuvrīhi satya-śavas- ‘having real strength’ (unaccented, but would be satyá-śavas-) is implicitly extracted from the compound and represented by tát, object of āvíṣ karta.

The third pāda has a striking phonetic figure vídhyatā vidyútā, which was already anticipated by pāda-initial vidā́in 8c.
