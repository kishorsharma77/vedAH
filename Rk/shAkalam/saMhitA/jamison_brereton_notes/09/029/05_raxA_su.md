áraruṣaḥ in pāda a can be gen. or abl. sg. Either of them can fit the syntax: as abl. it can be construed directly with rákṣā (“protect from …”) and be parallel to svanā́t in b; as gen., it can be dependent on svanā́t and part of the gen. NP samasya kásya cit. Ge follows the 2nd path (“vor dem Schnauben eines jeden Geizhalses”), while Re (and I) the 1st . I do so partly because an abl. simply gives more oomph -- protection from a non-giver seems more critical than simply from the sound of one -- but primarily because of the word order: the audience hearing a form that could be abl. immediately after √rakṣ would naturally take it as an abl. It’s possible that they would revise their opinion on encountering a 2nd abl.

followed by a gen. sg. to which áraruṣaḥ could belong, but it’s also possible (likely even) that they would see no reason to reinterpr. áraruṣaḥ.

The subordinate cl. in c does not fit with the main cl. very well, as the awkwardness of the publ. tr. shows. The problem is the verb: what is wanted in context is a modal in a purpose-type clause (“so that we will/may become free of insult”); this would work well with protection from the “sound” in pāda b. But mumucmáhe is resolutely pf. indicative (or redupl. pres. indic.; see Kü 380 and nn. 677, 678). Both Ge and Re supply material to smooth the transition, Re with a pres. part. attached to ab: “(nous plaçant) là où nous soyons à l’abri de la nocivité” -- thus also sneaking in the desirable modality. Ge starts a new sentence with c, supplying as main cl. “da wollen wir sein.” Kü avoids supplying anything, but sneaks in futurity in parens: “da wir von der Schmach befreit (worden) sind.” I don’t have a good solution and so stick with the awk. publ. tr.
