I prefer to maintain the older gloss ‘kiss’ for niṃs rather than flg. Gotō (200-201; cf. EWA s.v., Lub s.v. √nas) in the colorless substitution ‘approach’. Even if níṃsa- is in origin a redupl. pres. to √nas, passages like this, with múkhe ‘on the mouth’, support the richer semantics, which could have developed from an earlier ‘approach’, used metaphorically or euphemistically.
