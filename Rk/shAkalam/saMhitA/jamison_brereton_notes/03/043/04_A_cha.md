The reference to Indra changes from 2nd ps. in ab to 3rd in cd. It would be possible to attach ab to the preceding vs., which also has Indra in 2nd ps., and take cd as a new sentence. But the fact that both ab and cd have subjunctives (váhātaḥ and śṛṇavat) suggests that the two clauses go together.

Because of the accent on váhātaḥ, the ca is likely subordinating, as in fact the standard tr. (and I) take it. However, the sequence ā́ca (…) √vah shows unexpected accent on the verb form elsewhere (I.74.6, X.110.1), so it is possible that ab is a main clause with the verbal accent produced by this curious formulaic usage; see comm. ad I.74.6.
