On ṛñjase see comm. ad IV.8.1. A tr. “aim at/towards” would be more transparent here.

The problematic pāda here is c: diváḥ, kác cid, and ā́are difficult to construe and interpret. Ge takes the first as referring to ‘day’ rather than ‘heaven’ and makes it dependent on kác cid: “zu jeglicher Zeit des Tages,” but diváḥ is far more often ‘heaven’ than ‘day’ (the latter sense usually confined to use with trír ā́and a few temporal adverbs). Re takes diváḥ as an abl. of ‘heaven’ (“Il s’avance du ciel”), and he takes the kác cid adverbially with jánuṣā … śúciḥ (“pur de toute manière quant à la naissance,” where the indefinite sense of kác cid has been replaced by a totalizing one). In the publ. tr. I agree with Re in taking diváḥ as ablative of ‘heaven’, construing it with distant ā́, and supply ‘food’ with kác cid. But I now don’t think this makes much sense. I will suggest an alternative that makes more sense, but that doesn’t solve all the difficulties and requires some special pleading.

First I’d observe that the word order in this pāda seems particularly contorted.

I ascribe this to the position of janúṣā: this instr. occurs 20 times in the RV and it always occurs immediately after the caesura, whatever its function in the clause. In this particular case, it is generally agreed that janúṣā should be construed with śúciḥ (see Ge’s n. 1c), despite the intervening material. I’d argue that the need to plunk down janúṣā smack in the middle of the pāda has disrupted the constituencies of the rest of the pāda as well. Therefore, we cannot use word order and adjacency as reliable guides here (even less so than in the rest of the RV).

Now, let’s start with the verb véti, which opens the pāda, and with the observation that the poet of this hymn is supposed to be Vītahavya, who is in fact mentioned in both the other vss. of the tṛca (2c, 3d). If we decompose this cmpd.

name we can make a putative havyám ‘oblation’ the object of véti (cf. I.74.4 véṣi havyā́ni; sim. III.53.1, VI.60.15, etc.; for similar gapping in this hymn, see 14b), which can be qualified by kác cid: “he pursues any (oblation) whatever.” I further suggest that diváḥ should be construed with ā́, as in my publ. interpr., but that here ā́ means ‘all the way to X’, rather than ‘from X here’. Although in the ‘all the way to’ sense, ā́normally precedes the ablative (see Gr, s.v. ā́), as already noted, the word order in this pāda seems particularly scrambled, and, in any case, ā́often follows an acc. in the ‘to’ sense. I would therefore now substitute the tr. “Just he, blazing from birth, pursues any oblation whatever all the way to heaven.” This would be a description of the flames rising up towards heaven as they carry the oblation up to the gods.

The next pāda is implicitly contrastive: although the flames of the ritual fire actively reach for heaven in pāda c, the fire itself, just kindled, starts by burning the kindling sticks, which are immovable as opposed to the oblation later poured into the fire.

The cadence of d is bad.
