There is phraseological connection between the first pāda of this vs. and the previous vs.: cā́ru nā́ma “dear name” repeats verbatim the end of 16b, and though they are etymologically unrelated, kavayaḥ in 17a echoes ákavaiḥ in 16d.

The first half of the verse most likely refers to the Ṛbhus, though they are not named until c. The “dear name” of these unnamed subjects is probably “gods,” the predicative voc. devā(ḥ) in b. The Ṛbhus were not originally divine, but achieved the status of gods because of their wondrous acts in the sacrifice. So to be addressed as “gods” by Indra is precious to them indeed.

The second half-vs. consists of a pāda (c) with a sg. nom. (sákhā) referring to Indra, accompanied by a pl. instr. (ṛbhúbhiḥ) and no verb, followed by one (d) with a 2nd pl. impv. (takṣatā). It is tempting to construe the two pādas together, with a mixture of constructions: the sg. nom. + instr. serving as the equivalent of a pl. subj.

to the verb in d, but I have kept strictly to the grammar, as do the standard tr.
