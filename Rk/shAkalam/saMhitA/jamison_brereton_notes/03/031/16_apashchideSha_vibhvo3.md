My interpr. of this vs. differs significantly from the standard, beginning with the disposition of the pādas. Most take abc together, with d as a separate clause, while I divide the vs. into two hemistichs, which express parallel notions. In ab, in mythological time, Indra sends the waters surging; this is the standard happy denouement of the Vṛtra myth. In cd priests (even perhaps the Aṅgirases) impel another collection of liquid, the streams of soma -- the ritual equivalent of Indra’s cosmogonic release of the waters. Although the standard interpr. tacks pāda c onto ab, as describing the waters, it contains vocabulary that is strongly associated with soma: mádhu- ‘honey, sweet’, √pū ‘purify’, and pavítra- ‘filter’, and I cannot offhand think of another instance in which waters are said to be purified, though they are purifying.

In ab note the return of several lexical items: vibhū́- (13b) and sadhryàñc- (6b). The cid ‘also’ also links this vs. with a previous part of the hymn, namely 11b where Indra sends surging another group of fem. entities (ruddy [cows]): úd usríyā asṛjad índro arkaíḥ.

I do not understand why Indra is called dámūnāḥ ‘master of the house’. The word is generally an epithet of Agni (understandably), and there is nothing in this passage that seems to me to link Indra to the domestic sphere. In c mádhvaḥ is taken by most as fem. acc. pl. (by Schmidt as masc. nom. pl.).

Several exx. of this form are analyzed by Gr as either masc. nom. pl. or fem.

nom./acc. pl. However, none of these supposed examples is convincing, and it is best to take it here as the gen. sg. it usually is. It then needs a head noun. Old adduces nearby III.36.7 mádhvaḥ punanti dhā́rayā pavítraiḥ “they purify it in a stream of honey with purifying filters,” which is very similar to our pāda c. I therefore supply, with Old, a form of dhā́rā- ‘stream’ upon which gen. mádhvaḥ depends. The precise form I supply is acc. pl. dhā́rāḥ, modified by the (fem. acc.) part. punānā́ḥ and coreferential with dhánutrīḥ ‘runners’ at the end of the vs. The conceit in the phrase hinvanti … dhánutrīḥ is that the priests are spurring on the streams of soma (like) horses. As for the subj. of hinvanti, I take it as (the current) priests (as in the sim.

passage III.36.7 just quoted; also III.46.5, where Adhvaryus are the subj. of hinvanti).

It could also be, with Re, the Aṅgirases, who have been operating as priests in the Sattra depicted earlier.

Ge (/WG) take kavíbhiḥ as an adjective with pavítraiḥ (Ge: “mit geistigen Filtern”), but in my opinion there are no adjectival uses of kaví-. Instead it is used as a defining appositive (poets as filters), as I take it, sim. Re, or it is a separate agent with punānā́ḥ (“being purified by poets with filters”), with Schmidt (170).
