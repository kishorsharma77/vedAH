Whatever the etymology of aktú- ‘night’ -- I favor the connection with PIE

*nokw
t- ‘night’, pace EWA s.v.; see most recently LIN 505 and n. 20 -- it is here at least secondarily associated with √añj ‘anoint’ (which for some, e.g., EWA, is its etymon), since aktū́n serves as obj. of vy àñjate. My “glossy nights” is an attempt to capture the pun. For those who consider aktú- a derivative of √añj, aktū́n here would be an internal obj. / cognate acc.; cf. Oberlies (Relig. v. II.111): “Die [rotglühenden] Morgenröten verstreichen ihre Farbe …” In any case, aktū́n participates in two phonetic figures: añjate … ánteṣu aktū́n and the near-mirror-image aktū́(n) … yuktā́(ḥ).

As in the previous hymn (VII.78), Dawn is sg. in this hymn, except in one vs., in this case this one; in VII.78, vs. 3. 106
