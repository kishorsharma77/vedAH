The part. saṃvásānāḥ is generally ascribed to √vas ‘dwell’, and the standard tr. ‘dwelling together’ makes good sense as a descriptor of fingers. However, forms unambiguously belonging to this root are active, and there is no root pres. or aor.

Gotō (1st Class, 295 n. 698) therefore assigns the participle to √vas ‘wear’, which of course has a well-attested medial root pres., and tr. ‘gleichgekleidet’, an interpr.

maintained in WG. I find the morphological arg. persuasive, but the meaning somewhat elusive: what do fingers wear when making fire? (I do not think we should assume gloves.) I take it as a pun. In support of ‘dwell’, consider saṃvásana- ‘joint dwelling’ (IX.86.17).

Pāda c contains another hapax, atharyàḥ. This is generally taken as the gen. sg.

of a fem. atharī́-, often interpr. as a female animal, whose tooth is the object of comparison with Agni’s flame. See, e.g., Old’s extensive disc. ad VII.1.1 (Noten II, p.

2), where he tentatively opts for a mare. Hoffmann suggests rather (registered in EWA I.805) that it belongs with atharvī́- ‘following the way’ (athar-vī́) (I.112.10), with the loss of v on metrical grounds, while WG take it simply as a fem. -ī-stem to áthar-, which they take as a root noun cmpd *h2at-h2ar-íh2, and tr. ‘Wegzieherin’.

The publ. tr. ‘enveloped in flame’ starts from Hoffmann’s preform with -vī́-, but deviates in two regards. First it takes athar- with atharyú- with the meaning ‘flame, flaming’, and second it analyses the 2nd member as the root noun to √vyā ‘envelop’ (cf. hiraṇya-vī́- ‘enveloped in gold’, Scar 502). The phrase atharyò ná dántam would then be semantically parallel to the bahuvrīhi śúci-dant- (2x, of Agni) ‘having blazing teeth’. I am not at all happy with my analysis, however -- primarily because I am dubious about the existence of an athar- ‘flame’ and because the loss of v suggested by Hoffmann seems difficult to motivate. I would therefore tentatively withdraw the publ. tr., though I have nothing better to substitute. I wonder if the word is not implicated in the same interpretational difficulty as sā́tuḥ discussed above (7a). I doubt that a female animal is at issue.
