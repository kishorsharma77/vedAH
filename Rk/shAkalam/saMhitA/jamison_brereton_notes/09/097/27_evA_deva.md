The summary evā́might be more emphatically rendered as “in just this way” or sim. The “conclave of the gods” (devátāte) returns from 19a. As Ge points out, the whole hemistich is almost identical to IX.96.3, save for evā́in place of sá naḥ and devapā́naḥ for indrapā́naḥ.

The ppl. in the periphrasis in d, smási hitā́ḥ, could belong either to √dhā or to √hi (so Sāy.). It is actually not clear to me which one Ge favors from his “denn wir sind in grossem Wettstreit begriffen” (and his n. 27c doesn’t entirely clarify). Re clear chose √dhā: “Avec ambition [maháś cid?] nous nous sommes en vérité placéś dans la compétition.” I favor √hi: I think the point is that we are “driven” / “hardpressed” in the hostile encounter, and we need divine help - which we will only get once they have partaken of our soma. But there are several logical steps missing in every interpr.
