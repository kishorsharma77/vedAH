This verse seems to jumble together a lot of primal mythology that does not seem to be connected (or, rather, whose connection eludes me). As noted in the publ.

intro., vss. 4-5 describe the first institution of the sacrifice and touch on a number of the primordial players. It is esp. noteworthy (but I don’t quite know what to do with it) that vs. 4 contains the Aṅgirases and vs. 5 Atharvan, reminding us of the old designation for the Atharva Veda, atharvāṅgirasaḥ (see, e.g., Bloomfield, Intro. to Hymns of the Atharvarveda [SBE 42, 1897]).

The form tate is a pseudo-perfect to √tan; at this period we would expect

*tatne (which we in fact get at X.130.2). The light root-syllable is metrically
guaranteed. Kü (210) points out that it is formed as if to a root √tā, and such a root morpheme could have been extracted from the passive tāyáte. I would add that, as with many aberrant forms, the context invites this form: note the immediately following word, opening the next pāda, tátaḥ (recall also vítatam in 2b).

Note the chaining of ā́jani (b) … ājat (c) … jātám (d), with the middle term belonging to a different root (√aj) from the first and last (√jan).
