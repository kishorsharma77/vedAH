This verse nicely juxtaposes a well-known deed of Indra’s, when he stops the waters to make a ford for his client(s), with the even better known deed of releasing the stopped waters in the Vṛtra myth, treated in the preceding vs. (10). On the playful transition between these two myths here, see Jamison 2007: 113-14 n. 20. The stopping of the waters causes mild surprise immediately after a verse concerning their release.

tveṣásā is universally taken as belonging to Indra, whereas my published tr.

ascribes it to the rivers. I would now probably correct this, also to take it as Indra’s: “just this one - with his turbulence/glittering,” because of the parallelism between 10a asyéd evá śávasā and 11a asyéd u tveṣáśā. But I am still disturbed by the form.

Its accent suggests that it should be adjectival, not a neuter -s-stem abstract like śávas-, despite AiG II.2.224, which implies that it is nominal despite its accent. It is curious that the expected root-accented neut. noun (*tvéṣas-) is not attested, and this is the only (supposed) attestation of the suffix-accented stem. If it is a real adjective, it could modify vájreṇa in pāda b, but this not only breaks the parallelism between 10a and 11a just noted, but, more seriously, would have to be extracted from one clause and plunked into the next. (Ge in his note suggests supplying vájreṇa in pāda a.) The a-stem adj. tveṣá- is also sometimes used of waters, e.g., VI.61.8 tveṣáḥ … arṇaváḥ “glittering/turbulent flood,” which accounts for my original connection of tveṣásā with the rivers.

The distribution of elements in pāda b is odd, with the subordinating yád in normal 2nd position, but sīm, ordinarily another 2nd position element, just before the verb.

īśāna-kṛ́t- is variously interpreted, either with the 1st member in a direct object relationship with the 2nd -- “zum Herrscher, mächtig machend” (Scar’s tr; sim.

also Ge, Re, WG) - or in a sort of appositive subject relationship, “als Herrscher handelnd” (Scar’s tr.; sim. Gr). Because the first member īśāna- is itself a participial form ‘being lord, showing mastery’, I prefer the 2nd alternative. Note also that independent ī́śāna- is used three times of Indra in this hymn (6d, 12b, 15b), and it is more likely that the same form in the compound refers to Indra’s masterful ways, not to someone else whom he makes masterful. Scar allows both, though somewhat preferring the 2nd.

More phonological play: c dāśúṣe daśasyan; d turvī́taye … turváṇiḥ.
