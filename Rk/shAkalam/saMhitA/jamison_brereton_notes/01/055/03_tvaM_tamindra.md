As Ge notes, √bhuj ‘enjoy, derive benefit’ is formulaically associated with mountains, however odd that association may be to us. The question is then what does Indra enjoy like a mountain. Ge takes it to be one of the elements in b, either the ‘principles’ (neut. pl. dhárman-) or the ‘manliness’ (neut. sg. nṛmṇá-), and interprets masc. sg. tám in pāda as attraction from tā́ni or tád respectively. This is not impossible, but I prefer to take the object in the frame as soma, which has the correct gender and number, appeared in the previous vs. (2c), and is certainly something Indra enjoys (although I have found no passages in which soma is explicitly construed with √bhuj). The message of this first hemistich of vs. 3 - that Indra displays manly power in order to enjoy the soma - is essentially the same as that of 2c, where he “acts the bull” to drink the soma.

Re rather trickily interprets the simile / frame construction with one verbal expression in the frame (irajyasi “tu règnes sur”) and one in the simile (bhujé “comme on jouit”), but this completely violates the structure of RVic similes, which always hold the verbal notion constant between simile and frame. See Jamison 1982 (IIJ 24). WG supply soma, as I do, but also supply the verb ‘drink’ in pāda a and separate it syntactically from pāda b. There seems no reason to do that.

In c I am very tempted to read *devátāti with one accent, the loc. sg. of devátāt-, rather than the transmitted devátā́ti, that is, devátā + áti, with the adverbial instr. to devátā plus the preverb áti. (An asterisk should therefore be inserted in the publ. tr.) The loc. *devátāti would convey essentially the same meaning as devátā, and though prá √cit is very common, prá-áti √cit would only occur here. For a parallel construction with prá cékite + instr. and loc., see VI.61.13 prá yā́mahimnā́ mahínāsu cékite “The one who by her greatness shines ever more brightly among the great (rivers).”
