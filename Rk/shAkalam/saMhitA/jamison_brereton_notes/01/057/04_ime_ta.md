The translation “Here we are -- those of yours” reflects the annunciatory imé as well as the te … té vayám, which identifies the speakers as Indra’s own. In c I take cárāmasi as an independent verb, meaning to ‘carry on’ with life and activities, though it is possible that it is an auxiliary verb with the gerund ārábhya, as Ge takes it.

On kṣoṇī́- as ‘war-cry’, see Thieme (1978[79]: KZ 92: 46), EWA s.v. ### 05
táva smasi is a paraphrase of 4a (imé) te … té vayám
