Ge renders d exactly opposite to the publ. tr.: “so macht er den Vorderen zum Hintermann” (fld. by Klein, “āmreḍitas”: “he makes the one at the fore into one who lags behind”). But the simile in c is about walking one step at a time (“putting his two feet down one after the other”), and unless Indra is walking backwards my interpr. must be correct. It’s true that pū́rvam ‘in front’ precedes áparam ‘behind’ in the text, but word order is scarcely a reliable guide in the RV, esp. since in nominal sentences we often get PREDICATE SUBJECT order. (Furthermore, there's a sort of iconic ordering of the two adjectives, with pū́rva- first, which can be independent of the larger sense.)
