The first pāda contains a lovely sound sequence: (g)ā́va (up)āva(t)āva(tam).

The hapax rapsúdā is difficult. Ge refuses to tr.; Old suggests a connection with the rare lapsudín- (TS, etc.) ‘having a beard’. Although the phonology would obviously work, the semantic connection is shaky, and lapsudín- has no etymology either. I favor a suggestion of Re’s, that the word here is connected with the secondary root √rapś, extracted from virapśá- ‘abundance’, which in turn derives from *vīra-p(a)śu-, by most lights (see comm. ad I.122.4). The first part of the word (rapsú-) can be seen as preserving the -u-, which the other forms don’t, but losing the ví (for which cf. rapśád-ūdhan- 'with teeming udders' [II.34.5, of dhenus]). The palatal sibilant cluster (-pś-) was also regularized to one containing the dental sibilant (for possible parallel ex. see rāspiná- I.122.4, with metathesis as well). The second part of the word would be the root noun to √dā ‘give’, in the nom. sg. fem., modified by mahī́, indicating a vessel (perhaps ukhā́?). Although we should expect a nom. sg. - dāḥ, the final may have been lost either because it was simply reanalyzed as a fem.

stem with suffixal -ā- or because it was lost in continuous recitation (before the pāda-initial vowel of pāda c) and not restored redactionally.
