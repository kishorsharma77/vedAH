Pāda a continues the theme of competitive invocations embodied in the lexeme ví √hvā in 1c vihávanta with hávam … ví, even though the two words are not to be construed together.

“Your greatness” as an agent may seem odd, but consider “your majesty, your highness,” which pose no such problems in English.

I interpret bráhma in b as plural rather than singular because of pl. bráhmā in 1a and because there are multiple seers in 2b.

I take c with ab, contrary to Ge, who takes it with d. His is technically possible, but it seems to imply a backwards sequence of events: Indra is born only when he has taken the mace in his hand. Ge avoids the problem by radically bleaching the meaning of janiṣṭhāḥ to make it an auxiliary or copula substitute (“wardst”) with áṣāḷhaḥ: “so wardst du unbezwinglich.” This seems too high a price, esp. as jajñé appears in the next verse, where Ge gives it its full lexical value (“er ist … geboren”).

With janiṣṭhā áṣāḷhaḥ compare VII.20.3 janúṣem áṣāḷhaḥ.

Although nominative forms of the pres. part. to √as ‘be’, particularly sán, are ordinarily concessive, I cannot see a concessive force here. Perhaps it is here almost as a place-holder, to match the yád forms in the same position in surrounding pādas (2b, c, 3b [whose yán in sandhi rhymes with sán]).
