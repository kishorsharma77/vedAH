Pāda a is almost a rhyme form with 7c tám mā viyanti ādhíyaḥ / 8a sám mā tapanti abhitaḥ, and 8c ví adanti mā́dhíyaḥ cleverly picks up viyanti ādhíyaḥ of 7c in a different metrical form (post-caesura trimeter, instead of dimeter).

Unlike the standard tr., I take the ribs (párśavaḥ) as a second simile, not marked with a simile particle (unless also covered by the preceding iva) because in the hymn in general the poet seems to express a “higher” distress than a backache -- instead a questioning of his previous mode of existence and his religious beliefs. That pṛṣṭyāmayī́‘having a stitch in his side’ in 18d is also in a simile gives further support to the simile interpr. here.
