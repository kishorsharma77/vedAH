All Gods  
Kusīdin Kāṇva  
9 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
The first two tr̥cas (vss. 1–6) of this hymn to the All Gods mention only the Ādityas  and are quite straightforward. The poet praises the help of these gods in the first  tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) and asks for valuables in the second (vss. 4–6). The final tr̥ca turns to  other gods (see esp. vs. 7) and to a more interesting topic: the ultimate kinship of  gods and men (vss. 7–8). The gods are reminded of this relationship presumably to  stimulate them to give help and goods.
