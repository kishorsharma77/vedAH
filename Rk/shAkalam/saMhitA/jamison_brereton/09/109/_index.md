Soma Pavamāna  
Dhiṣṇya Fires, descendants of Īśvara  
22 verses: dvipadā virāj, arranged in trcas ̥  
The Anukramaṇī’s fanciful ascription of this hymn to the dhiṣṇya (“holy”) fires  finds no echo in the composition itself.  
The lightness and brevity of this meter (each verse containing four pādas of  a mere five syllables each) do not lend themselves to complex phraseology or elaborate images. Instead the hymn consists primarily of standard apostrophes to  Soma (e.g., the imperative “purify yourself” occurs five times in the hymn: vss. 4, 5,  6, 7, 10) and simple present-tense descriptions of the process of preparation (e.g.,  vs. 11 “they purify”; vs. 12 “they groom”).
