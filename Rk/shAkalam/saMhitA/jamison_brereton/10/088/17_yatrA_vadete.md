When the lower [/nearer] one and the higher [/farther] one debate with  each other, (they ask) “Of the two leaders of the sacrifice, which of  us two knows it through and through?”  
Have our comrades been able to achieve joint revelry? Have they  realized the sacrifice? Who can proclaim this here?
