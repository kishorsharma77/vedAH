Most take the expression in b to mean “let it be dearer to you than a dear thought”; this seems to me nonsensical or at least rhetorically weak. I suggest that there is a pun on priyá-, which can mean both ‘dear’ and ‘own’. Here the poet suggests that his composed thought will be dearer to Agni than anything the god himself might produce.
