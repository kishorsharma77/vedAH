Pāda c lacks a verb to govern the acc. vithurā́śávāṃsi. On the model of 1cd, 2ab, and 2cd, we might simply deploy the (first) verb of d, jahí, across the pāda boundary: “smash their faltering powers” or, with proleptic adj., “smash their powers (to be) faltering.” However, vithurā́is derived from the root √vyath ‘falter’, whose causative supplied the verb in 2ab, vyathayā. I therefore think there’s a different kind of trick here: the poet expects us to supply the CAUSATIVE feature of the verb in 2b with the lexical feature of that verb contained in the adj. vithurā́-- hence my tr.

“(render) their powers faltering.”
