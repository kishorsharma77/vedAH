As was suggested in the publ. intro., this vs. may constitute a weak omphalos. In particular, the purport of the first hemistich is not clear to me: what does it mean to say “the gods are in your secret”? Re supplies ‘domain’ with niṇyé, but doesn’t elucidate. Ge floats two possibilities in his n. 4a. The first, which he says is illuminated by IX.95.2, is that the gods are Soma’s secret, which only he can reveal. This is not quite what IX.95.2 says; there Soma reveals the hidden names (gúhyāni nāma) of the gods, with an acc. pl. not a loc. sg. I am more convinced by his 2nd proposal, that we supply loc. nā́mani with niṇyé, and interpr. it to mean that Soma’s “secret name” is amṛ́ta- ‘immortal’ (‘ambrosia’), a word indeed regularly used for soma. Since this word is also, of course, a standard descriptor for the gods, they are/exist, in the verbal sense, “in your secret (name).” Although the loc. nā́man(i) is not found in the RV, this seems an accidental gap. The multistep mystery—1) figure out what, if anything, to supply with niṇyá-: nā́mani; 2) solve for what the “secret (name)” is: amṛ́ta; 3) then apply the resultant name to the gods—is worthy of an omphalos. To make the tr. clearer I would substitute “it is in your secret (name [=(drink of) immortality]) that all these gods [=the immortals] are …”
