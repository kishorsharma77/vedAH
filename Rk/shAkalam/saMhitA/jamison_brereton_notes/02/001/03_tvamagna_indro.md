HvN suggest the distracted reading namasí yaḥ here and in 10a, which produces 12 syllables for the Jagatī line but a very bad cadence (4 light syllables), while reading an undistracted form produces a good Triṣṭubh line. They argue 1) that namasí ya- is always otherwise distracted in the RV (though it doesn’t otherwise appear in a cadence) and 2) that there are several other similar bad cadences in this hymn (avidhat 7d, 9c). These are good arguments, but I would still favor an undistracted namasyàḥ in a Triṣṭubh line.

Ge suggests that vidhartaḥ in d is a predicate voc. I think rather that it signals the absent middle term, the divinity with which Agni is here identified, namely Bhaga. So Old (SBE). Bhaga is identified as vidhartár- in VII.41.2 and is regularly associated with Puraṃdhi.
