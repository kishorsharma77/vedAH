The meter of the first pāda is badly off and is not easily fixable. See Old.

He suggests a distracted reading of nū́and records the suggestion that márto should be emended to márti yo, which HvN print as their text. If both are adopted (distracted nū́and márti yo; so Arnold p. 310), the line achieves 11 syllables, but the price may be too high, esp. as the light fourth syllable would be unusual.

Although dáyate generally means ‘distribute (goods to someone else)’, e.g., I.68.6 tásmai … rayíṃ dayasva, in a few passages it seems to have adopted the more “middle” meaning ‘receive/take a share’, perhaps adjusted to the model of other words of sharing, esp. bhájate ‘receive a share’ versus act. bhájati ‘share out, distribute shares’. See Gotō (1st Kl., 172-73), whose tr. of this passage is close to mine. As noted ad II.33.10, I do not subscribe to Gotō’s separation of forms of dáyate into two separate roots.

The three subsequent pādas (bcd) state the conditions under which the mortal in pāda a will receive the longed-for share. They are marked by the rel. prn. yáḥ in b and c; adopting Re’s strategy I have rendered them as conditionals (“if”) for clarity, rather than as straight rel. clauses (“who”). Unfortunately I don’t think my tr. makes it clear that cd are parallel to b, rather than being part of a resumed main clause, and I would now slightly emend the tr. to “…, if he will set … and will seek …”). The apparent non-parallelism is exacerbated by the fact that the verbs of c and d (yájāte and āvívāsāt respectively) are subjunctives, whereas dā́śat in b should be the injunctive to the thematic pres. dā́śati, which elsewhere attests a real subjunctive (dā́śāt). KH discusses just this passage (Inj. 238), suggesting that in such contexts the indicative present, injunctive, and subjunctive overlap in usage. 130
