On dīrgháprasadman-, see comm. ad VIII.10.1.

I don’t quite understand “non-poisonous food”: is this an understated way of referring to good food, or is it a real fear? In VI.39.5 we call upon the king (Indra or Soma) to give (√rā) non-poisonous plants. I also don’t understand the use of hí here, since c does not seem to be the cause or grounds for ab, but rather a parallel clause.
