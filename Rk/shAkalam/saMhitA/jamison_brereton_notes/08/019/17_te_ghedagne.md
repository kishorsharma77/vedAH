The first hemistich resembles VIII.43.30 té ghéd agne svādhyò, 'hā víśvā nrcák ̥ ṣasaḥ, but in my opinion has a very different meaning. Given vs. 16, in which Agni’s brilliance produces the light by which gods and men see, I take nṛcákṣashere as ‘providing sight for men’, as opposed to its usual senses ‘having (one’s) eyes on men’ or ‘having a manly gaze’.
