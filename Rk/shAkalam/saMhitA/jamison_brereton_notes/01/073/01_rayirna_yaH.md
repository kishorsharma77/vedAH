For the complex relationship between ‘vitality’ (váyaḥ) and the father, see disc. ad I.71.7. The “wealth acquired from one’s father” also reminds us of I.70.10, where the sons divide and carry away the property of their aged father.

Agni’s traversing of the (sacrificial) seat (sádma … ví tārīt) in my opinion refers to the removal of what is later called the Āhavanīya fire from the Gārhapatya fire at the west end of the ritual ground and its ceremonial placement at the east end.

See 2d.
