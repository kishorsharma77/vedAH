On Soma identified as “truth” (ṛtám), see IX.97.23, IX.108.8, and Lü 581-82. Although ṛtáṃ bṛhát could be an acc. goal here, the parallels, esp. the identical pāda in the next hymn, IX.108.8, support a nom. identification. In IX.97.23-24 Soma is also identified as a king (rā́jā 24b) as here and as ‘possessing dhárman’ (dharmā́23c), reminiscent of dhármaṇā here.

The Pp. analyses árṣan opening c as injunc. árṣat, while the publ. tr. assumes a nom. sg. pres. part. árṣan. Either is of course possible, but the parallelism with vs. initial tárat may support the finite verb interpr., as Old points out. So an alt. tr. would be: “he rushes …” See Hoffmann (117) on this vs.; he is surely right that the two injunctives should receive the same interpr., rather than Re’s indic. pres. tárat, modal árṣat, and Hoffmann’s “general” pres. interpr. seems apt here for both.
