I do not understand the apparently tautological 2nd pāda, prá pravāséva vasataḥ, with the same type of double etymological figure as in VIII.27.16.

Renderings like Old’s “wie Reisende reisen sie” (sim. Ge, Re) are literally correct but give no hint as to what the simile is conveying. There must be some wordplay here, perhaps an astronomical reference? In later Skt. prá √vas can refer to exile or banishment, and already in RV III.7.3 the causative means ‘cause to live apart, banish’; in II.28.6 the poet expresses the hope that we won’t have to go to pravasathā́ni ‘foreign dwellings’ and in VIII.60.19 Agni is a house-lord áproṣivān ‘who doesn’t go abroad’ (or, I suppose, just out of the house). Assuming that this meaning is also operative in pravāsá- accounts for my “like exiles.”
