Agni Vaiśvānara On the structure of this complex hymn and for a verse-by-verse synopsis, see publ. intro. It has been much translated and discussed -- in addition to the usual treatments, see, e.g., Thieme, Gedichte; Renou, Hymnes spéculatifs; Wendy Doniger, Rig Veda. Oldenberg (ZDMG 55.296-97) gives a detailed (for him) account of the contents and pronounces it an ākhyāna, an opinion repeated in the Noten, though he doesn’t spell out who the speakers might be verse by verse. Gonda (Vedic Literature, 99) calls it “a profound glorification of Agni as the great immortal conceived as the inner light and placed among the mortals to guide them in the mysteries and intricacies of the ritual.” As discussed in the publ. intro., the hymn concerns the development of the poet’s craft and resembles IV.5, in which the poet also receives his poetic inspiration from Agni Vaiśvānara. I do not see the poetic contest (brahmodya) that others (starting with Geldner [Ved. Stud. II.181-82], fld by Re, Doniger, George Thompson [“Brahmodya”]) take as the mise en scène of the hymn.

See Old’s explicit rejection of the brahmodya interpr. (ZDMG 55.297), with which I concur. The brahmodya interpr. primarily rests on a brief phrase in vs. 2, on which see below.
