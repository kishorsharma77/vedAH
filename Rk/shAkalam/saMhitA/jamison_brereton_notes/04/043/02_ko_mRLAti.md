Again, two occurrences of katamá- and one of the pl. devā́nām keep the widest possible range of choices for the answer to these questions.

On “Sūryā chose the chariot” and sim. expressions as an indication of the svayaṃvara (self-choice) marriage in the RV, see my “The Rigvedic svayaṃvara? Formulaic evidence” (Fs. Parpola 2001). Although, as just mentioned, the first halfvs. keeps the options open, the mention of Sūryā and the chariot immediately narrows down the choice of answer to the Aśvins (to a contemporary audience).
