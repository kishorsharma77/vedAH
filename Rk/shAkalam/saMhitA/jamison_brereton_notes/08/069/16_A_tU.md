The first hemistich seems addressed to the present-day Indra, recalling his boyhood deeds recounted in 15ab.

The second half matches vs. 7, with the same proposition that Indra and I (=poet, in my opinion; Ge rather Viṣṇu) should become comrades (both times with sacevahi). The referent of the multiple accusatives in cde is disputed. Old suggests the sun, in part because sahásrapād- is used of the sun already in AV VII.41.2. Ge also considers the sun the referent of the accusatives in cd, “den himmlischen, tausendstrahligen, rötlichen (Sūrya),” but separates those in e into a separate constituent (as far as I can tell), “den fehlerlosen, zum Heile führenden (Weg) folgen,” because pāda e is found in VI.51.16ab ápi pánthām aganmahi, svastigā́m anehásam qualifying ‘path’. I prefer to read all the accusatives together and take the path (of VI.51.16) as the referent. This also involves interpreting sahásrapādam as ‘having a thousand steps’, not ‘… a thousand feet’. This recalls vs. 7 “… become comrades at the seven(th) step…,” and I would suggest that the “thousand step” version plays off the previous one, indicating that our comradeship will last even longer. The path itself may be the soma (see disc. of 7) that facilitated the establishment of our comradeship; see 7c.
