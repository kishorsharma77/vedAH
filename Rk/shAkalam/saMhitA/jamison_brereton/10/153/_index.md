Indra
Devajāmaya Indramātaraḥ
5 verses: gāyatrī
The first verse of this hymn presents a tender image of unidentified females rocking  the baby Indra, and verse 2 continues with a more conventional treatment of his  birth. But the birth motif disappears (except for an attenuated version in vs. 5c): the  hymn then continues with standard praise of his powers—the word ójas “might” is  positioned prominently in four of the five verses (2–5).
