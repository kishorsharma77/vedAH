As noted above (ad vs. 4), I would now change “your two parents” to “your two fathers” because of the contrast with the “two mothers” of 2.

The naḥ in 2nd position in the vs. does not fit easily into the first hemistich (though cf. Ge “Du Agni (sei) uns im Schosse der Eltern als Gott …”). I have postponed it to the 2nd hemistich -- with no verb in the 1st this seems possible -- and taken it as a gen. dependent on kāráve ‘bard. It could also be taken as a dat. with tanūkṛ́t in a chiasmic construction exactly like that of 7cd discussed above. Hence, “become body-creator for us and fatherly solicitude for the bard. Otherwise it might be possible just to assume that it was generated to the pattern tváṃ (no) agne in the rest of the hymn, when another syllable was needed. Both Re and Old (SBE) simply ignore it.
