Indra
Durmitra Kautsa or Sumitra Kautsa
11 verses: predominately uṣṇih (per Anukramaṇī)
The meter of this hymn is, to say the least, highly irregular and variable from verse  to verse. Despite the Anukramaṇī analysis it is better analyzed as consisting mainly  of verses with a seven-syllable middle pāda, and one or more triṣṭubh pādas before  and/or after. See Oldenberg (1888: 158–59).
The hymn also poses many problems of interpretation, and the metrical and ver bal anomalies have led many commentators to consider the text corrupt—a judg ment by which we are tempted. Even if not corrupt, the text is stylistically abrupt,  contorted, and compressed, and many puzzles remain unsolved. The hymn also  appears to be jocular in places, making sly fun of Indra and cutting him down  to size. This is especially clear in the section devoted to Indra’s pair of fallow bay  horses (vss. 2–5), where the poet implies that without his horses Indra is nothing

much: it’s the horses that give him prestige (see esp. vss. 3–4). The sections concern ing his weapon (vss. 6–7) and the sacrifice (vss. 8–10) accord Indra more of his usual  glory, but still in oblique phraseology.
