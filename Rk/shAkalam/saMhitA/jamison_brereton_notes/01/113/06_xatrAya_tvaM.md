Ge takes ártham iva as a real simile, containing a pun on ártha- (though he does not call attention to it): “um (an sein Geschäft) wie nach einem Reiseziel zu gehen,” with ártha- ‘business’ in the frame and ‘goal’ in the simile. This is clever and may well be right. In my publ. tr. I take iva as a sort of indefinitizer: “whatever his goal.” WG by contrast seem to take it as a definitizer: “um just zum Ziel zu gehen,” which seems an odd use of iva.

The standard tr. construe c with d and the phrase vísadṛśā jīvitā́as object of abhipracákṣe (e.g., Re “Afins qu’ils considèrent les (modes d’) existence divers, l’Aurore a éveillé toutes les créatures”). I am skeptical of the syntax, because the dpāda is a refrain. Although in some refrain hymns, the refrain is sometimes integrated into the verse as a whole, this refrain does not seem to work that way.

Moreover, the sense conveyed seems contrary to what preceded it: the creatures in 5-6ab seems single-mindedly intent on their own particular goals, not open to contemplating different “lifestyles.” I therefore take c as an independent clause, summarizing 5-6ab: different people have different aims. This requires taking neut.

jīvitā́as ‘living beings’, rather than ‘modes of living’. I would prefer that it was not neut., but cf. neut. bhúvanāni (in the refrain and often elsewhere) ‘creatures’. jīvitáis found only once elsewhere in the RV in IV.54.2, where it seems to mean ‘lives’.
