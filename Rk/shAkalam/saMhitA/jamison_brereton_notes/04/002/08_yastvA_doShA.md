Because the loc. phrase své dáma ā́“in his own house” in c does not seem to fit the equine simile there, in the publ. tr. I took it implicitly with ab. However, cf. I.143.4 agníṃ táṃ gīrbhír hinuhi svá ā́dáme “urge Agni on with songs here in his own home,” with a form of √hi and the same loc. phrase. If the hapax hemyā́-vant- is derived from √hi (so Old, SBE and Noten, generally now accepted) and means something like ‘possessing/receiving impulsion, much impelled’, the spurring or impulsion may refer to hymns and be happening in Agni’s own home. So an alternative tr. might be “receiving the spurring (of hymns) in your own house, like a horse you will carry …” The separation of hemyā́vān from the simile áśvo ná invites but does not require reading hemyā́vān primarily with the frame, not the simile.
