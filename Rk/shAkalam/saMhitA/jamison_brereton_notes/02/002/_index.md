Agni One curious feature of this hymn is that it is the home to the densest cluster of uṣás- occurrences in II (vss. 2, 7, 8); the word is otherwise pretty rare in this maṇḍala, and there are no Dawn hymns in it. The focus on Agni’s likeness to the sun probably accounts for this. This likeness is hinted at first in the adj. svàrṇara- ‘possessing solar glory’ in 1c. This adj. is echoed by three occurrences of the simile svàr ṇá “like the sun” (7d, 8b, 10d), where the simile particle ṇá (with close sandhi retroflexion as always after svàr), though having nothing to do with the -ṇa- in the adjective, reproduces it phonologically.

Another notable feature of the hymn is the fact that the stem citáya-, which occurs three times (4c, 5d, 10b), in all three cases must be read doubly, as ‘appear’ in one construction in the passage and as ‘perceive’ in another construction in the same passage.
