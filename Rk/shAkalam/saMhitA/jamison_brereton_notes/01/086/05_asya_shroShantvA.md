The condensed expression of the earlier part of the hymn continues here, and there is no consensus on how to construe pāda c, which has no overtly signaled connection with the rest of the verse. For example, Ge takes it as a simile, marked by cid, with its comparandum in pāda b (roughly, “who dominates the peoples like the flowing nourishments the sun”). But even if cid could mark similes (and I don’t think it can), the simile doesn’t make sense. I will not rehash here the various possibilities floated by other interpretations. My own generally follows Renou’s in supplying asyá from 1a as the oblique predicate of a possessive nominal sentence: “(his) are …” It would also be possible to take the perfect participle sasrúṣīḥ as the predicate: so WG “Sogar zur Sonne sind (seine) Nahrungen gelaufen (erreicht),” but the exact value of such a predicated perfect participle eludes me.
