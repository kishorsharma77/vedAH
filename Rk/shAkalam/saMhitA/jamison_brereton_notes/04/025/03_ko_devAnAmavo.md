On ávivenam / ávivenan see comm. ad IV.24.6. Assuming the -am form is correct here, it would be an absolutive in -am. In IV.24.6 the same expression mánasā́vivenan/m qualified the mortal worshiper (acdg. to most -- see disc. there).

Here it seems to qualify the gods. However, it is just possible that as an adverbial absolutive it could refer to the mortal worshiper, represented by kásya: “the pressed soma plant of which (mortal), never losing track in his mind, do …” The fact that until this sentence the mortal had appeared in the nom. káḥ could contribute to the somewhat mixed construction.
