Soma Pavamāna
Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: gāyatrī
The poet begins his hymn with a request for benefit, though a rather generic one (vs.  1). The militant theme of the previous hymn is visible in verse 2, while the story of  the falcon’s theft of Soma from heaven, a myth not prominent elsewhere in Maṇḍala  IX, is the subject of verses 3–4. Unlike most of the gāyatrī soma hymns, this one  contains no explicit reference to the preparation of the soma, with only a glancing  mention of the “impelling” of soma in the final verse (5), a term generally used in IX  of the push that starts the soma on its purificatory journey through the filter.
