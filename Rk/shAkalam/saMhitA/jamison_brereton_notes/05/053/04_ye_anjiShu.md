The vs. consists entirely of a nominal rel. cl. without verb, presumably hanging off vs. 3.

The problematic form is the hapax śrāyā́(Pp. śrāyā́ḥ). It is generally taken as a nom. pl. thematic deriv. of √śri, so ‘resting in’, attenuated by some to ‘provided with’ (with loc.). I cannot find particular fault with this analysis, save for its banality and the unclear source of the root-syllable ā. I am inclined instead to take it as an instr. sg. (śrāyā́, equally possible in this sandhi situation) to a derivative of √śrī, parallel to śriyā́, which is regularly used of the Maruts. But I confess I do not know why śriyā́wouldn’t have been used instead or exactly what the derivational mechanism would be, incl. again the source of the vṛddhi.
