For vyáti- (RV 3x), despite Mayrhofer’s apparent skepticism (EWA s.v.) I follow Re’s deriv. (EVP 15: 37) from vi √yam with a presumed development ‘hold separate/apart’ à ‘pair’, though Re doesn’t deign to indicate what the semantic channel might be.

khārī́-, a measure of capacity’, is found only here and much later in the sūtras and Classical Skt, but it appears to be widespread in MIA. See EWA s.v. ### 20
mā́dabhrám (“not a little!”) is a prohibitive lacking a verb, though an aor.

injunc. can easily be supplied of course: *dāḥ matching the impv. dehi in the positive expression preceding it. Or alternatively s-aor. *bhāḥ (i.e., *bhār) to match flg. bhara.
