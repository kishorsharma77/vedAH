véṣi rāyáḥ). Moreover, in root-noun cmpds with this root, vowel-final preverbs are lengthened: pratī-vī́- (3x), prā-vī́- (1x), and cf. devā-vī́- (12x) beside deva-vī́- (1x, though cf. common devá-vīti-). (On these lengthenings see Scar 499, 500, 501.) The derivation is not without problems. If the form is a gerundive (as I’d like), the root accent is fine, but we would expect guṇa or vṛddhi, not zero-grade.

Despite this formal problem, I think this root affiliation and formal interpr. solve many of the problems that other interpr. face, and so I would emend the tr. to “… with (riches) to be tracked down/pursued …” in place of “… to clothe (him).”
