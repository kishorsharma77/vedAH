This vs. contains two sleight-of-hand manoeuvres. The first involves the simile and frame with pári ṣiñcata ‘sprinkle around’. This verb ordinarily takes an acc. of the liquid sprinkled; see for ex. the immed. preceding hymn with the same lexeme: IX.107.1 pári … ṣiñcata sutám “sprinkle around the pressed (drink).” But the acc. in the simile, áśvaṃ ná is the target of the sprinkling, not the liquid. So although the cases agree (implicitly: there is no expressed acc. in the frame), they have different syntactic functions (the opposite of my “case disharmony”). So Ge explicitly (n. 7a). For horses as obj. with √sic, see IV.43.6 síndhur ha vāṃ rasáyā siñcad áśvān “The Sindhu River sprinkles your [=Aśvins’] horses with the Rasā.” The 2nd sleight of hand follows immediately. Both the verb and the string of acc. that follow demand the obj. *sómam, but instead we find the near rhyme form stómam ‘praise’. Rather than emend this to the easier reading (as Old seems inclined to do, along with numerous others; see his comm.), it is better to accept the implicit equation of the two ritual elements: the offered liquid and the offered words. This is not the only place in the RV where this trope is found.
