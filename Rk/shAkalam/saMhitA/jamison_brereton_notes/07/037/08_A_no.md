The first pāda of this vs., ā́no … stavádhyai, is reminiscent of 1a ā́vo … stavádhyai, and thus forms a ring, already anticipated by the echo of 1c tripṛṣṭhaíḥ in 7c tribandhúḥ. However, it also makes an appeal to Savitar, who does not figure otherwise in the hymn, and thus seems to anticipate the first two vss. of the next hymn, VII.38, which are dedicated to that god. Indeed the Anukr. identifies that whole hymn as dedicated to Savitar, but see publ. intro. to VII.38 for the view that it really is an All God hymn.
