vádhīḥ … ghanéna, with verbal √vadh and nominal √han reverses the expected distribution found, e.g., in VII.104.16 … hantu mahatā́vadhéna (cf. also I.94.9), with verbal √han and nominal √vadh.

The phrase ékaś cáran is a first instantiation of the lexeme famous in much later times from the Rhinoceros(-horn) Sūtra. For the phrase in the dharma lit. and the association with the rhinoceros (not, in my opinion, its horn), see Jamison 1998.

upaśāká- is only here, but śāká- is several times used of the Maruts or Aṅgirases in their roles as helpers of Indra (IV.17.11, V.30.10). Therefore, though there is a disjunction between “going it alone” and being accompanied by a host of helpers, I take upaśākébhiḥ as personal here. The upa- may mark them as particularly subsidiary, or it may simply have been prefixed to the stem because it is a signature word in this part of the hymn.

Other tr. take sanaká- as the name of a group, but it seems a perfectly wellformed -ka-suffixed form of sána- ‘old’, with a pejorative diminutive sense appropriate to belittling one’s enemies. So Edgerton (1911 [k-suffixes]): 53): “the old rascals.” My “old codgers” is also an attempt to capture the slangy and deprecatory tone. On the demotic value of -ka- see Jamison 2009 (IIJ 52).

Ge takes prétim īyuḥ as an idiom “gingen in den Tod,” but despite the later such usage of pra √i, this idiom does not appear in the RV. As indicated in the intro., I take this as referring to the separation of sacrificers from non-sacrificers.
