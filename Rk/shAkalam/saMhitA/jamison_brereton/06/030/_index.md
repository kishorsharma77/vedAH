Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn is entirely a celebration of Indra’s cosmogonic and cosmos-maintaining  deeds and powers. The only possible indications of a human dimension in the hymn  are the oblique reference to the soma sacrifice in the first pāda of the hymn, the  granting of good things in the second pāda, and the ruminative “I think” at the  beginning of the second verse. The pace of the hymn is brisk, but this straightfor  
ward recital of the high points of Indra’s career has a pleasing balance and variety  in its expressions.
