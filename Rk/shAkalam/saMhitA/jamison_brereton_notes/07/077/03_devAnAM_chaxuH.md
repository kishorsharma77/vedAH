More chaining: the compound etym. figure with dṛś in 2c is echoed not only by a repetition of the entire first member of the cmpd. sudṛ́śīka- (3b) but also in the pass. aor. adarśi (3c), while the fem. agent noun netrī́of 2d returns as a participle náyantī (3b), likewise fem., and the aor aśvait of 2b matches the adj. śvetá- in 3b.
