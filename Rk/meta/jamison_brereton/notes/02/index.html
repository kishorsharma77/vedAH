  <p>Maṇḍala II</p>
<h2 id="1">1</h2>
<p>Agni
For the rhetorical structure of the hymn, see the publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="11">1.1</h3>
<p>The only attestation of the desiderative of √śuc is this hapax adj. āśuśukṣáṇi-
‘eager to blaze here’.</p>
<h3 id="12">1.2</h3>
<p>The accent on ási in d presumably results from its contrastive function in the
ca … ca construction. Curiously Old does not comment.
Note the two different words for house in gṛhápatiḥ … dáme, with the former
replacing old dáṃpati-. On these various terms for house-lord, see my forthcoming
articles “The Term gṛhastha and the (Pre)history of the Householder” (to appear in
The Householder in Ancient India: A History of the Gṛhastha, ed. Patrick Olivelle)
and “The Double Life of gahapati” (to appear in a forthcoming Fs.).</p>
<h3 id="13">1.3</h3>
<p>HvN suggest the distracted reading namasí
yaḥ here and in 10a, which
produces 12 syllables for the Jagatī line but a very bad cadence (4 light syllables),
while reading an undistracted form produces a good Triṣṭubh line. They argue 1) that
namasí
ya- is always otherwise distracted in the RV (though it doesn’t otherwise
appear in a cadence) and 2) that there are several other similar bad cadences in this
hymn (avidhat 7d, 9c). These are good arguments, but I would still favor an
undistracted namasyàḥ in a Triṣṭubh line.
Ge suggests that vidhartaḥ in d is a predicate voc. I think rather that it signals
the absent middle term, the divinity with which Agni is here identified, namely
Bhaga. So Old (SBE). Bhaga is identified as vidhartár- in VII.41.2 and is regularly
associated with Puraṃdhi.</p>
<h3 id="14">1.4</h3>
<p>On this vs. see Thieme, Mitra and Aryaman, 83-85.
sambhújam in c is analysed by Gr as a 1st sg. subj. or injunc. (his “Co.”) to a
thematic aorist and is so rendered by Ge (“von dem ich Nutzen haben möchte”),
though he expresses doubts in his n. However, this aor. stem does not otherwise
exist: the multiple bhujema forms, apparent optatives in mā́prohibitives, are
convincingly explained by Hoffmann (Injunk. 95–97) as reanalysed from an
expression with the infinitive bhujé followed by enclitic 1st ps. pronoun. Moreover,
act. forms to this root should mean ‘give pleasure’, not ‘derive pleasure’ (cf. bhuñjatī́
I.48.5). Old (Noten) already disputed the verbal interpr. of sambhújam, and it is now
generally taken as a nominal (so Thieme, Mitra and Aryaman, although in Fremdling
[16 n. 2, 105] he takes it as a verb; Hoffmann, Injunk. 96 n. 197; Re; Scar 358),
though WG tr. it as a verb, allowing for the nominal possibility in their n. Assuming
that sambhújam is nominal, the problem is how to fill out the defective rel. cl. yásya
sambhújam. Most supply a verb like “we eat” or “we expect,” e.g., Scar. “von dem
ich Genuss (erwarte, o. ä).” The publ. tr. takes GEN sambhújam as a possessive
expression: “whose common meal (it is)” à “who has a common meal,” further
2
extended to “who offers a common meal.” I find this more satisfying syntactically
than the invention of a verb, but it runs into morphological difficulty: by my tr. the
meal should be nominative, and if sambhújam belongs to a root noun paradigm, it
can only be a masc. acc. sg. This forces me into the unhappy position of assuming a
root-accented neut. thematic stem -bhúja-, which may be unlikely enough
morphologically to persuade me to supply a verb to govern the acc.</p>
<h3 id="15">1.5</h3>
<p>Pāda a has the acc. and dat. appropriate to an expression of giving, but no
verb; pāda c has the verb (rariṣe) but no dative of recipient. The accusatives of gift in
the two pādas are formed in parallel: suvī́r
i
yam (a), s
u
váśvi
yam (c).The two pādas thus
complete each other rhetorically.
In b gnā́vaḥ is morphologically incoherent. By its ending it should be
vocative, but since it occupies non-initial position, its accent should preclude that.
Nonetheless, with all the standard interpr. I take it as a voc. An ad hoc explanation
could be concocted for its accent &ndash; that the following voc. mitramahaḥ induced
accent on the preceding one to support the voc. phrase &ndash; but I think too many
counter-examples could be adduced. Ge suggests a word haplology, gnā́&lt;ḥ&gt; gnāvaḥ,
but this seems unnecessary and also requires a tr. “you are (the Wives).” It is likely
instead that the third term in this pāda is Tvaṣṭar from pāda a, since he is regularly
associated with the Wives of the Gods, and in fact the other attestation of this voc.
gnā́vaḥ (I.15.3), correctly accented in pāda-initial position, refers to Tvaṣṭar.
As pointed out by Old (SBE) and Ge, the third term in pāda c is presumably
Apām Napāt, who is elsewhere called āśuhéman-, including 2x in II. The āśu- in that
compound echoes the beginning of āśuśukṣáṇiḥ in 1a, though that form is most
probably formed to the desid. stem of √śuc with preverb ā́, since the -ani-suffix is
rather commonly built to desiderative stems and there would be no obvious source of
the -s- before the suffix otherwise.</p>
<h3 id="16">1.6</h3>
<p>I do not understand the cmpd śaṃgayá-. Wackernagel (AIG II.1.309) classifies
it with cmpds with governing first-member prepositions, but śám, though
uninflected, does not function like even the improper prepositions/preverbs like
áram. He does recognize its singularity (314–15), but keeps it in this category, in

<h3 id="17">1.7</h3>
<p>Pāda d has another bad cadence: te (á)vidhat, with 4 light syllables, assuming
the normal shortening of -e before vowel. The same cadence is found in 9c. I would
be inclined to follow HvN in seeing this irregular cadence as characteristic of this
particular hymn (see also 3b, 10a), save for the fact that ávidhat shows a remarkable
tendency to position itself in bad cadences: see II.26.4, VIII.23.21, 27.15, 61.9. As IH
points out to me, Arnold (p.129, §169.vi) suggests reading ā́vidhat with long
augment. Though in all cases the Saṃhitā text transmits either short á or deleted
abhinihita (á) and the Pp analyzes it as a in all cases, this seems a reasonable
explanation – despite Old’s dismissive “recht zweifelhaft.” There is a tendency to
lengthen vowels before elements beginning with v, not only the augment, but
3
preverbs, and 1st cmpd. members, presumably spreading from forms that originally
began *Hv. In most of the other occurrences of ávidhat (I.136.5, VI.54.4, IX.114.1)
the augment has coalesced with a preceding a-vowel and its weight is therefore
unrecoverable. Only in X.83.1 do we find an ávidhat that is not improved by a heavy
reading: it occurs in the break after an early caesura. But even here ā́vidhat is a
possible reading. Though ⏑ ⏑ – is the most preferred break, – ⏑ – is the next most
common.</p>

<p>Here and in 15a I take práti (+/- copula) + ACC. as an expression similar to
pratimā́na- + GEN, meaning ‘be a counterpart to’.
For ṛñjate here, see the fuller expression with instr. in the next hymn, II.2.5.</p>
<h3 id="19">1.9</h3>
<p>It is tempting to take iṣṭíbhiḥ as ‘with sacrifices’, parallel to śámyā ‘with ritual
labor’ in the next pāda. So Old (SBE), though he gave it up reluctantly in the Noten.
Unfortunately ‘sacrifice’ is accented íṣti-, against iṣṭí- ‘desire’, and so perhaps the
best one can do is suggest a secondary pun (so Scar 455). On the other hand, on the
assumption that all -tí-stems began with suffixal accent and that the root accent found
in some Vedic -ti-stems is secondary (see Lundquist 2015, -ti-stems), this may be a
relic of suffix-accented *iṣṭí-‘sacrifice’, which has not yet undergone accent
retraction. It is worth noting that root-accented íṣṭi- is found only in I and X.
On the cadence in 9 see remarks on 7b.</p>
<h3 id="110">1.10</h3>
<p>On the cadence in pāda a, see comm. ad 3b.
As Old (SBE) already pointed out, the first three pādas refer to the three
Ṛbhus and pun on their names: ṛbhú- ‘craftsman / Ṛbhu’ in a, vā́ja- ‘prize / Vāja’ in
b, and ví bhāsi ‘you radiate / Vibhvan’ in c.
In c dakṣi is surely a -si impv. to √dah ‘burn’ and should be separated from
the identical form in I.141.8, for which see the comm. ad loc. Ge, however, takes
dakṣi here to √dakṣ.
The form viśíkṣu- in d is taken by Gr as belonging to the desid. of √śak and
meaning ‘gerne Gut austheilend’, which seems unacceptably distant from both the
root meaning of √śak and the function of the desiderative. Moreover, √śak is not
otherwise attested with ví except, supposedly, in the similar form ví śikṣa IV.35.3
(for which see below). Ge tr. “du bist der Prüfer,” Re “tu es celui que si met à
l&rsquo;oeuvre diversement”; neither discusses the form or its root affiliation, and one can
only assume they follow the assignment to √śak, though exactly how is unclear. Old
(SBE) suggested an appealing alternative, interpreting it as built to the desid. of √śas
‘cut’, which is primarily found with ví &ndash; an idea I find eminently worthy of revival.
This may also be the view of WG, who tr. “Du bist williger Verteiler,” again without
disc., so they may in fact simply reproduce Gr’s understanding of the semantics. Old
does not sketch out the morphology, but it presumably rests on *śi-śs-su-, with zerograde root and simplification of the medial sibilant cluster śss arising from the two
radical sibilants and the desiderative suffix. The finite verb ví śikṣa in IV.35.3 (also a
4
Ṛbhus context) belongs here as well. Heenen (Desid., 232-33) mentions this
possibility though without great enthusiasm (“La possiblité … n’est pas exclue”).
The publ. tr. “seek to carve up and to stretch out the sacrifice” implies that
ātániḥ is desiderative. This was not meant, and the tr. should perhaps be emended to
“seek to carve up the sacrifice, as the one who stretches it out” or “… as you stretch
it out.”</p>
<h3 id="113">1.13</h3>
<p>The relevant construction in d is probably tvé … ā́hutam “poured into you,”
as it is in the even further distracted identical phrase in 14ab. The tr. of 13d should be
corrected to “the gods eat the oblation poured into you.”</p>
<h3 id="114">1.14</h3>
<p>The first half-verse is simply a rather crudely exploded version of 13d (also
found in I.94.3), with tvé moved to front of first pāda and the second pāda otherwise
intact. See Bloomfield&rsquo;s withering scorn.</p>
<h3 id="115">1.15</h3>
<p>On práti … asi, see comm. ad 8d. As far as I can determine, this is the only
occurrence of sám √as in the RV and, rather than meaning something like ‘be
together’, it seems to have an idiomatic meaning like prati + ACC, ‘be equal to’ (as if
to samá- vel sim.).
On the word order in pāda c, see comm. ad VI.15.14.</p>

<p>I do not understand the function or position of hí, though the latter question is
more tractable.</p>
<h2 id="2">2</h2>
<p>Agni
One curious feature of this hymn is that it is the home to the densest cluster of
uṣás- occurrences in II (vss. 2, 7, 8); the word is otherwise pretty rare in this
maṇḍala, and there are no Dawn hymns in it. The focus on Agni’s likeness to the sun
probably accounts for this. This likeness is hinted at first in the adj. svàrṇara-
‘possessing solar glory’ in 1c. This adj. is echoed by three occurrences of the simile
svàr ṇá “like the sun” (7d, 8b, 10d), where the simile particle ṇá (with close sandhi
retroflexion as always after svàr), though having nothing to do with the -ṇa- in the
adjective, reproduces it phonologically.
Another notable feature of the hymn is the fact that the stem citáya-, which
occurs three times (4c, 5d, 10b), in all three cases must be read doubly, as ‘appear’ in
one construction in the passage and as ‘perceive’ in another construction in the same
passage.</p>
<h3 id="22">2.2</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) take náktīr uṣásaḥ as acc. of extent of time, supplying as subj. either
prayers or priests. With Old (SBE and Noten) and Re, I take the phrase as subject in
the publ. tr. This means that uṣásaḥ must be taken as a nom. (for uṣā́saḥ), rather than
the acc. it was historically &ndash; but this is common in the RV. On reflection I wonder if
Ge is right: the 2nd hemistich contains two examples of acc. of extent of time (mā́nuṣā
yugā́and kṣápaḥ), and there is also one in 8a, uṣáso rā́myāḥ, that is very similar to
5
the phrasing here. If the phrase is interpr. as acc., the subject to be supplied would
presumably be the same as the 2nd pl. addressees of 1ab, namely the priestly
officiants. So I suggest an alt. tr. “Through the dawns and the nights they [=priests]
bellow towards you …”
In addition the pf. vavāśire might better be rendered as a habitual pres.
‘(constantly) bellow’.</p>
<h3 id="23">2.3</h3>
<p>The gerundive védya- in c is universally assigned to √vid ‘know’ (e.g., Ge
‘allbekannt’, Re ‘(re)connaissable’), but surely the Vedic Indians would be more
anxious to acquire a chariot (√vid ‘find, acquire’) than simply to recognize it! Agni is
found with the same simile in VIII.84.1.</p>
<h3 id="24">2.4</h3>
<p>A difficult vs. with multiple interpretations, which I will not treat in detail.
The difficulties of the vs. arise in part from the fact that it can apply to both the ritual
fire and the sun. Note that in contrast to the first three vss. the word agní- does not
appear in this vs., which absence licenses the double reference. This double reference
begins, and is least obscure, in the first pāda, where the entity in question (tám)
grows “in the airy realm (as/and) in his own house”: “his own house” is clearly a
reference to Agni as the fire in every house (see also 11c), but “in the airy realm” can
refer both to the strengthening of the sun’s light after it rises and to the smoke and
flames of fire rising in the air. Note that there is no simile marker here: the fire is not
compared to the sun or vice versa; they are identified.
The second pāda uses the technical ritual term ā́√dhā ‘establish’ (used of the
ceremonial establishment of the ritual fire), but it is also used less technically here
for the placement of both fire and sun on their respective paths. Loc. hvāré ‘on a
meandering (course)’ can refer to the unpredictable motion of fire and its products
(smoke/flames). How this word can apply to the sun is less clear, since the sun’s
course is certainly not unpredictable. However, derivatives of the root √hvṛ can refer
to curves, and the sun’s trajectory up, across, and down the sky can be seen as a
curving path. (This second sense should have been registered in the publ. tr.) I should
say that I explicitly do not think that it refers to a snake here (pace Old [SBE], WG),
although the interpr. is tempting due to the similarity of the lexicon and imagery in
this vs. to I.141.7, where hvārá- refers to Agni as a twisting snake. Such an
identification here would require emendation to acc. *hvārám, which Old was willing
to accept in SBE and still defends in the Noten, but which does not conform to our
current restrained attitude towards RVic emendation (in part due to Old). I also do
not think that candrám in the simile refers to the moon (as Thieme [KlSch 78] and
WG do).
In c ‘son’ is universally supplied with patarám ‘flying, winged’ (e.g., Ge “den
geflügelten (Sohn?) der Pṛśni”). But Pṛśni’s son(s) are the Maruts; Agni never seems
to be so identified. The closest any interpreter can come is X.189.1, where a gaúḥ
pṛ̥́śniḥ ‘dappled cow’ may, or may not, refer to the fire, but there is no parental
engagement there. The gen. pṛ́śnyāḥ (as here; on the ending see comm. ad 7b) is
elsewhere construed only with ‘udder’ (ū́dhar-, II.34.2, 10; cf. also IV.3.10) or ‘milk’
6
(páyaḥ, VI.48.22); though it is true that the alternative gen. pṛ́śneḥ is found with
‘sons’ (pṛ́śneḥ putrā́(ḥ), V.58.5), these are the Maruts, as expected. Since the only
other attestations of pṛ́śnyāḥ in II limit ‘udder’, I supply that word here. Although
“the flying (udder) of Pṛśni” sounds comical, I take it to refer to a rain cloud, as also
apparently in II.34. The fire and the sun are thus implicitly compared to this third
entity. I read citáyantam in two senses, ‘appearing’ and ‘perceiving, observing’ (cf.
citayat in the immediately following vs.), with the former sense here.
The other sense of citáyantam governs the rest of the vs.; the instr. akṣábhiḥ
‘with eyes’ signals the ‘perceive’ value, as is reflected in all the standard tr.
(although WG take the participle as a double tr. ‘make perceive’, which is not
supported by the zero-grade root syllable [expect *cetáyantam]). We are not home
free, however, for the simile, pāthó ná payúm, gives trouble. The problem is pātháḥ.
If we try to take it to as acc. to neut. pā́thas- ‘pen, fold’, which would work
semantically (“observing … as a protector (does) a fold”), the accent is wrong; if we
try to take it as gen. of pánth- ‘path’, which also works semantically (“like the
protector of a path”), the length of the first vowel is wrong. Lub tries to avoid this
Scylla and Charybdis situation by identifying it as a 2nd du. pres. to √pā ‘protect’, but
this makes more difficulties: who are the two subjects? (perhaps he means the two
races, but they are in 3rd ps. ref.), and the placement of the ná is badly wrong. In the
end I follow the ad hoc solution set out by Old (Noten): a gen. of the ‘path’ word
makes most sense, and it may owe its anomalous long vowel to phonological
attraction to pāyúm in the same syntagm along with some conflation with pā́thas-.</p>
<h3 id="25">2.5</h3>
<p>The apparent fem. loc. pl. vṛdhasānā́su to the irregular participial stem
vṛdhasāná- ‘growing, having grown’ is generally taken as referring to the plants
among which the fire is blazing, on the basis of X.92.1 &hellip; śuṣkāsu háriṇīṣu járbhurat,
with járbhurat ‘flickering, quivering’ as here. However, plants do not ‘grow’ when
they are burned &ndash; quite the contrary &ndash; and I’m not at all sure that √vṛdh ‘grow,
increase, strengthen’ is used of plant growth: we may be misled by translation
language. Instead on the basis of IV.3.6 dhíṣṇyāsu vr̥dhasānó agne “growing in the
holy places [=hearths], o Agni,” I interpret vṛdhasānā́su as representing vṛdhasāná(ḥ)
āsu, with masc. nom. sg. + fem. pronominal loc. and irregular sandhi of -aḥ ā-. There
are only three occurrences of the stem vṛdhasāná-; in addition to IV.3.6 and our
example here, the other one, at VI.12.3, is also nom. sg. referring to Agni. One
potential problem with this suggestion is that, since the hearths have not been
previously mentioned, we might expect accented āsú. However, a number of
occurrences of unaccented āsu lack clear referents in the preceding discourse (e.g.,
I.95.5, III.55.9, VIII.41.7).
Like citáyantam in 4cd, citayat in d has two different readings: with the
preceding phrase dyaúr ná stṛ́bhiḥ it means ‘appear’, while with the following ródasī
ánu (echoing jánasī ubhé ánu in 4d) it means ‘perceive’. The functional split is
clearer in this vs. than in 4cd and could be considered a species of poetic repair, or at
least “poetic reinforcement.” See also vs. 10 below.

<h3 id="26">2.6</h3>
<p>Note the phonological and morphological parallelism of the infinitival datives,
s(u)vastáye, suvitā́ya, vītáye.
II.2.6–7: 6c and 7c are paraphrases of each other. Each contains a dual referring to
the two worlds, an impv. of √kṛ, and an indication of directionality.</p>
<h3 id="27">2.7</h3>
<p>sahasrín- (sg. or pl.) regularly modifies rayí- and vā́ja-; bṛhánt- has a wider
range of referents, but both rayí- and vā́ja- are found. Since (sg.) rayím occurs in the
immediately preceding vs. (6b) and (sg.) vā́ja- in the immediately following pāda
(7b), either is available to supply as the referent for the pl. adjectives in pāda a. I opt
for vā́ja-, because of the nearer proximity.
If śrútyā in the Saṃhitā text represents dat. śrútyai (so Pp.) and belongs to a -
ti-stem, it shows the younger ending (borrowed from the -ī-stems) -yai, confined to 7
stems mostly limited to Maṇḍala X (Macdonell VG p. 282), rather than the
extraordinarily common -aye. This younger ending may correlate with the younger
accent in this -ti-stem: as Lundquist has shown (“On the Accentuation of Vedic -tiAbstracts,” Indo-European Linguistics 3 [2015]), -ti-stems undergo accent retraction
in the course of Vedic, and root-accented forms are innovations in the late RV. Vs. 4
contains another fem. short -i-stem with a younger ending borrowed from long -īstems, namely gen. pṛ́śnyāḥ. However, I wonder how secure śrútyai is. The use of
this dative (quasi-)infinitive here is somewhat unusual, and I take its supposed double
(also śrútyā in sandhi) in X.111.3 as an ablative. Old (Not.) points out that the
gerundive śrútya- appears several times modifying vā́ja- (VII.5.9 vā́jaṃ śrútyam,
I.36.12 vā́jasya śrútyasya). I am tempted to take our śrútyā here as somehow
reflecting the gerundive, in a situation where the expected masc. acc. sg. *śrútyam
would produce a bad cadence. But I cannot construct a plausible scenario; Old says
that an acc. pl. is not entirely excluded, but that would have to be an acc. pl. neuter or
fem., and vā́ja- is masc.
Kü (251) takes ví didyutaḥ as intrans., not trans.-caus. (in his terms,
“inattingent” not “faktitiv”), interpreting uṣásaḥ as temporal. I am doubtful.
The simile in d svàr ṇá “like the sun” is perfectly ambiguous. It can be
nominative, compared to Agni, the subject of ví didyutaḥ, as an entity that makes the
dawns shine. (Given the temporal proximity of dawn and sunrise, this causal
connection is perfectly in order.) Or Agni can make the dawns shine forth like the
sun, with the simile in the acc. In 8b and 10d the same simile is in the nominative,
but I do not think this is a sufficient reason to impose the same analysis here.</p>
<h3 id="28">2.8</h3>
<p>Note #sá idhāná(ḥ) echoing 1c #samidhānám and 6a #sá … samidhānáḥ.
With Old (SBE), Ge, Re, I take uṣáso rā́myā as parallel in a temporal
expression (“dawns and nights”). Hoffmann (Injunk., 121; fld. by WG) rather clevely
separates them, construing only rā́myā with ánu: “Entflammt alle Morgen, nach den
Nächten leuchtet er.” However, because night(s) and dawn(s) are regularly used in
parallel (e.g., 2a in this hymn), I am somewhat reluctant to adopt this interpr.
8
The standard tr. (Old [SBE], Ge, Re, WG) take dīdet as a modal, but it is
simply an injunctive and I see no reason to attribute modal value to it. So also
Hoffmann (see his tr. just cited) and Kü (228).
In the second hemistich agníḥ was omitted in the publ. tr., which should read
“With the libations of Manu Agni conducts …”</p>
<h3 id="29">2.9</h3>
<p>As Old and Ge point out, mā́nuṣā should not be a fem. nom. sg. with dhī́ḥ,
since the fem. stem is well-attested mā́nuṣī. Nonetheless, the standard tr., including
Ge though excluding Re, interpret it with dhī́ḥ &ndash; Ge by taking it as shortened from
mā́nuṣāṇām at pāda end (some shortening!) and tr. “die menschliche Dichtung” as if
it were a simple modifying adjective. I instead take it as neut. pl. and supply
‘lifespans’ (yugā́(ni)), which is commonly found with this adj., including in our 2c.
By my interpr. it expresses extent of time, indicating that poetic inspiration is a
constant that will always ensure rewards for men generation after generation. For a
similar thought see III.39.2 sanajā́pítryā́dhī́ḥ the “ancient-born, ancestral hymnic
vision.”
Most interpr. take iṣáṇi as a loc. infinitive with the preceding acc. as obj. (For
the most recent disc., see Keydana, Infinitive im Ṛgveda, 195–96.) This may well be
possible, but given its isolation and the unclarity of its morphological shape (see esp.
the disc. by Old, Noten), I take it as a simple locative, construing the accusatives in d
as Inhaltsakk. with dúhānā in c. In any case it produces a bad cadence (4 light
syllables); I do not see an easy repair strategy.</p>
<h3 id="210">2.10</h3>
<p>As in vss. 4 and 5, a form of citáya- (here citayema) has two different senses
in two different constructions, by my interpr. In pāda a it shows a development of the
‘perceive’ sense, here rendered “get in sight of,” that is, “by our efforts get close
enough to see.” The means by which we do so is árvatā “by steed,” namely warfare
or contest. In pāda b citayema has a developed sense of ‘be perceived, appear’,
namely ‘be distinguished / distinguish ourselves’. Here the means is bráhmaṇā ‘by a
sacred formulation’, that is, by ritual or poetic competition. The standard tr. simply
supply a verb in pāda a (‘acquire’, vel sim.), but the double usage of the other two
forms of citáya- in this hymn suggests that this one, too, can be used for both pādas,
and it is always preferable to avoid supplying verbs. Both WG and Proferes (68) in
different ways take citayema with both pādas; Proferes interpr. it as a trans.-caus. in
both pādas (“manifest”), WG only for the first (“erscheinen machen,” but “schauen
können” in b). As noted above (ad vs. 4), the zero-grade root syllable tells against the
trans.-caus. interpr.</p>
<h3 id="211">2.11</h3>
<p>With most, I interpr. iṣáyanta as ‘derive nourishment’, though Lub lists it
with √iṣ ‘send’ and WG tr. “streben,” presumably assigning it to √iṣ ‘seek, desire’.
The acc. singulars yám … yajñám probably do not belong together, although
an interpr. “whom they approach as the sacrifice,” with Agni identified with the
sacrifice, is not impossible. Ge considers it attraction from *yásya … yajñám, but a
9
loose purpose/goal accusative, almost a pseudo-infinitive “to sacrifice,” seems
syntactically acceptable to me.</p>

<p>Pāda a is supposed to contain a lexeme práti √añj governing dhā́māni, but this
would be the only ex. of the verbal idiom in the RV. I therefore take práti as
governing dhā́māni ‘foundations’, in a parallel expression to tisró dívaḥ práti in b. I
supply “of the earth” with dhā́māni on the basis of I.22.16 dhā́mabhiḥ pr̥thivyā́ḥ. The
participle añján would be used absolutely and anticipate sám anaktu in d. The early
part of the hymn has a tendency to station present participles at pāda ends, and not
always with obj. (1d árhan, our 2a, 2c undán, 3a árhan).</p>
<h3 id="34">3.4</h3>
<p>The apparent loc. védī (so Pp.) should probably be read védi for metrical
reasons (see Old: “nur angeblich Pragṛhya” [Noten]; Proleg. 456). AiG III.154–55 is
skeptical about a loc. -ī to -i-stems and suggests that this, the clearest example, is
actually to be explained by haplology from *védy[ām] asyā́m, which seems highly
unlikely, esp. since it would make the cadence metrically irreparable. I think we have
to take this form as given and as a locative (not instr.), with a metrically short final
vowel, which may result from shortening in hiatus. For a similar ex. see bhū́mī (/ -i)
in IX.61.10 and comm. thereon.
The last pāda contains a mixture of voc. (devā ādityāḥ) and nom. (yajñíyāsaḥ),
with pāda-initial víśve ambiguous, since the accent may derive from its position. The
tr. does not reflect this case mixture, since a meticulous separation would be fussy
and serve no purpose.</p>
<h3 id="35">3.5</h3>
<p>As Old points out, suprāyaṇá- is metrically bad here and worse in several
other occurrences; it should be read *suprayāṇá-, which presumably belongs to √yā,
not √i.
I take the adjectives in d (yaśásaṃ suvī́ram) as proleptic, the result of the
purification, though this interpr. isn’t strictly necessary.</p>
<h3 id="36">3.6</h3>
<p>In b vayyèva belongs to a vṛkī́-type stem vayī́- ‘weaver’, here in the dual. Old
suggests that it doesn’t really matter if we analyze it as vayí
yā iva, with masc. du., or
vayí
ye (i)va with fem. du., but given that the other adjectives in the hemistich, ukṣité
… raṇvité, are feminine in form and that uṣā́sanáktā is regularly fem., the latter
seems more likely.
The vs. lacks a finite verb and there is no verbal form, finite or participial, to
govern ápāṃsi ‘labors’ in a. Most tr. supply ‘work’ vel sim., but I think it’s possible
that sādhú is an adverbial predicate, “on target” in the publ. tr., and that it loosely
governs ápāṃsi.

<p>Re and WG supply ‘sacrifice’ as the obj. of sám añjataḥ, but since acc. devā́n

<p>sādháya(nti) in pāda a and svadháyā in c occupy the same metrical position

<p>subhára- here is used in a different sense (or senses) from the same word in
4b, where it referred to the good burden, that is, the seated gods, that the barhis was
bearing. Here I think there is a pun: the hero is ‘easy to bear’, that is, his birth,
depicted in pāda b, was easy. But the hero so born provides good support to those
who depend on him.
With Re, I tr. ví ṣyatu in two slightly different senses with two different
objects: ‘unbind’ with ‘navel’ (nā́bhim), referring to the technicalities of the birth
process, and ‘release’ with ‘offspring’ (prajā́m), referring to the results of birth.
The Tvaṣṭar verse in Āprī hymns generally directly concerns only his
participation in the birth process (see I.142.10, III.4.9=VII.2.9, X.110.9, X.142.10;
our pādas abc). Releasing the sacrificial animal and escorting it to (the fold/pen of)
the gods is properly the province of the post (“Lord of the Forest,” vánaspátiḥ, 10a),
and that expression (“go to [the fold of] the gods”) is a euphemism for the animal’s
death. However, note X.70.9–10, where both Tvaṣṭar and the Lord of the Forest
convey the animal to the fold of the gods (devā́nām pā́thaḥ). Like X.70.9 our pāda d
implies that the journey of the sacrifical animal (that is, its death) occurs under the
auspices of Tvaṣṭar, and in fact, given the apparent temporal/logical connector áthā
beginning pāda d, the implication is that the offspring born in abc is to undertake this
journey. This seems rather muddled: our new (human) offspring is not the sacrificial
animal. I think the roles of Tvaṣṭar and the Lord of the Forest were quite distinct, but
conflations like this could occur because the Tvaṣṭar and Vanaspati vss. are always
adjacent in Āprī hymns and because the vocabulary is similar: Tvaṣṭar’s ví √sā
‘unbind/release’ and Vanaspati’s áva √sṛj ‘release/discharge’. The fact that the
victim is usually not overly expressed (presumably a euphemistic avoidance) makes
confusion all the more likely.</p>

<p>The stem suvṛktí- generally refers to a hymn and has in fact virtually been
substantivized to mean hymn. However, it must be a bahuvrīhi in origin; I generally
tr. ‘having a good twist’, referring to the clever adornments, the turns of phrase, of a
skillfully crafted hymn. Here I think it has two senses: first, characterizing Agni
himself as ‘having a good twist’, perhaps referring to his swirling smoke and flames,
but then, as a sort of secondary or double bahuvrīhi, ‘having [/receiving] (hymns)
11
with good twists’. In this meaning it is parallel to suprayásam ‘having [/receiving]
pleasurable offerings’. Note that the two are both final in their pādas. I do not think
Ge’s “euren Preis” or Re’s “hymne (incarné)” are either necessary or illuminating.
On the desiderative gerundive didhiṣā́yya- see comm. ad I.73.2. Although the
tr. “desirable to install” is somewhat heavy, the complexity of the formation seems to
require a weighty tr.
The last pāda indulges in play with the name Jātavedas: devá ā́deve jáne
jātávedāḥ. The first and last elements, devá … vedāḥ, are virtual mirror images, with
the 2nd word ā́deve reinforcing the first, and jáne making an etymological figure with
jātá.</p>

<p>The combination of honoring Agni “in the seat of the waters” (a) and the
Bhṛgus “once again” installing him among the clans (b) suggests that this vs.
concerns the well-known myth of Agni’s flight and concealment in the waters and
the Bhṛgus’ discovery, recovery, and reinstallation of Agni as the ritual fire. X.46.2
begins with a pāda identical to our pāda a and then relates the Bhṛgu’s finding of the
fire gúhā cátantam “hiding in secret”: imáṃ vidhánto apā́ṃ sadhásthe, … padaír ánu
gman / gúhā cátantam uśíjo námobhir, ichánto dhī́rā bhṛ́gavo ‘vindan “This one here
&ndash; having done honor to him in the seat of the waters, they followed him along his
tracks &hellip; / With reverences seeking him who was hiding in secret, the fire-priests, the
insightful Bhrgus ̥ found him.” The same myth may be alluded to, in ring
compositional fashion, in vs. 9 of our hymn. Note also that the poet to whom this
hymn is ascribed is Somāhuti Bhārgava.
II.4.2–3: As IH pointed out to me, dvitā́dadhur in 2b can be read, contra Pp. adadhur,
as dvitā́dadhur, with perfect indic. or pres. injunc.; I now favor the unaugmented
reading for reasons given below.
The contrast between the verbs in 2ab imám … (a)dadhur bhṛ́gavaḥ and 3ab
agníṃ devā́saḥ … dhuḥ seems to encode the primal installation of Agni by the gods
(3) and the recent installation, by men (2). Why the primal installation is expressed
by a root aor. injunc. is not clear to me, but I would now alter the publ. tr. to “Agni
did the gods install …,” from “Agni have the gods installed …,” to reflect the remote
past. Note also that the opening of 3b is metrically aberrant, with an opening of 3.
HvN suggest a rest in 4th position. It would be possible to restore *dadhuḥ, which
would match the same verb in the same position in 2b, but I think it’s more likely
that the omission of a syllable is meant to call attention to the difference in verb
stems. A rest in 3rd position, producing a syncopated dhuḥ might be better. If the two
verbs are being directly contrasted, an unaugmented dadhur in 2 is more likely than
augmented adadhur (in order to highlight the difference in stems). Discussion with
IH has helped me clarify my interpr.</p>

Narten’s tr. (KlSch 370 n. 5) is similarly intransitive though with a temporal, rather
than goal, acc.: “Er soll die Nächte hindurch leuchten.”
Note mitrám √dhā in b reprising the same lexeme in 1c.

<p>The predicate adj. raṇvā́qualifies both puṣṭíḥ and sáṃdṛṣṭiḥ; for the latter see

I take dákṣu- as a pseudo-desid. u-participle; also dhákṣu- in X.115.4.
Because dodhavīti in d is unaccented, it cannot be the verb of the relative
clause beginning with yáḥ in c, despite the standard tr. Instead the intensive part.
bháribhrat must be predicated in the rel. cl. and dodhavīti interpreted as the verb of
the main clause.
Because of the equine simile and imagery, the primary reading of dodhavīti
vā́rān must be “twitches his tail(-hairs),” but a second reading “shakes out choice
things” is also invited.</p>

<p>This vs. describes the changes in color and form of the kindled fire as a sight
to be wondered at. My tr. follows Ge’s in outline and many details. The first sight is
of the shapeless dark cloud of smoke (a), but that transforms into color and bright
light (bc). On ábhva- see my forthcoming “The Blob in Ancient India” (UCLA
CMRS 2015 dragon conf. vol.), and for a parallel passage (also adduced by Ge)
VI.4.3 … yásya panáyanty ábhvam, bhā́sāṃsi vaste sū́ryo ná śukráh “He whose
formless mass [=smoke] they [=mortals] marvel at …, he (then) clothes himself in
lights, like the brilliant sun,” which seems to show parallel progress from dark to
light and also contains a form of bhās- as here.
vanád- ‘wood-eater’ assumes a root noun 1st member ván-, preserved in a few
forms such as loc. pl. váṃsu (see Schindler, Rt. Noun), against the overwhelming
number of forms to thematic vána-.
I do not understand the simile in b, uśígbhyo ná “as if for the fire-priests.”
Perhaps the point is that the fire-tending performed by Uśij-priests would cause the
smoke to dissipate and the flames to appear, but that in their absence this change
comes about anyway. Note that in X.46.2, quoted above ad vs. 2, the Bhṛgus seem to
be identified as uśíj-priests, so the simile here may be referring to ritual behavior in
ancestral time. WG tr. “wie den (danach) Verlangenden,” but uśíj- is elsewhere the
designation of a priest (and cf. Old Aves. usij-) and is so tr. by them elsewhere (e.g.,
I.60.4).
For ráṃsu as adverbial loc. pl. to the root noun ráṇ- see Schindler Rt. Noun
and EWA, both s.v. raṇ. And note raṇvá- in the preceding and following vss. (4a,
6c).
The last pāda describes the graying of the ash (“having grown old”) and then
the rejuvenation of the flames presumably by the addition of more firewood.
13</p>
<h3 id="46">4.6</h3>
<p>The standard tr. take bhā́ti as the operator of the simile (e.g., Ge “Der nach
den Hölzern ausschaut(?) wie der Durstige (nach Wasser)”), but this doesn’t make
much sense. From vanád- ‘wood-eater’ in the immediately preceding vs. I extract
‘eat’ to govern vánā and to be compared to tātṛṣāṇáḥ ‘thirsting’ in the same semantic
realm, hence my “(eating) wood like one athirst.”
My ‘red-hot’ for tápuḥ contrasts nicely with kṛṣṇā́dhvā ‘having a black road’,
but is unfortunately not entirely legitimate: it is more literally just ‘hot’; there is no
color component.
Act. pf. ciketa in c might be expected to mean ‘perceives’, as generally, but it
must mean instead ‘appears’; so all the standard tr., and see also Kü (175) on the
unusual sense. It is all the more surprising given med. cikite in the same meaning in
the immediately preceding vs. (5c). But in this case the two forms may have been
seen as metrical variants with identical sense, since ciketa is always pāda-final, cikite
always post-caesura, as here.
The unexpressed concept in the simile “like heaven smiling with its clouds”
must be lightning, which smiles (I.168.8) or laughs (V.52.6). Lightning is white, like
(some) clouds.</p>
<h3 id="47">4.7</h3>
<p>The root √svad is generally a ritual technical term: the ritual fire “sweetens,”
that is, “ritually prepares” the oblations. Here the forest fire performs the same action
on the non-ritual ground. Although this might depict some version of slash-and-burn
agriculture (so WG), I think it more likely that the point is merely to give a ritual
dimension to the wild and unpredictable actions of the forest fire, in the hope of
exerting some control over it. The same sentiment is found in I.169.3 agníś cid dhí
ṣmātasé śuśukvā́n, … dádhati práyāṃsi “For even a fire blazing in the brushwood
can produce pleasurable offerings.” The position of ná after the verb asvadayat in
our passage suggests that the simile is targeting the verb, an extremely unusual
situation in Vedic poetics.</p>
<h3 id="48">4.8</h3>
<p>The phrase tṛtī́ye vidáthe “third rite of distribution” probably refers to the
Third Pressing (though the two other occurrences of “three vidáthas”, at VI.51.2 and
VII.66.10, do not seem to). Agni is of course present at all the pressings, but is not
especially associated with the Third Pressing; however, tṛtī́ye sávane at III.28.5 is in
an Agni context.</p>
<h3 id="49">4.9</h3>
<p>In the publ. tr. I supply with gúhā a form like hitám (cf. I.23.14, II.11.5,
IV.5.8, etc.), cárantam (III.1.9) or cátantam (I.65.1, X.46.2) referring to Agni when
he was hiding in the waters, a myth I also think is referred to obliquely in vs. 2 of this
hymn (see above). Our vs. 2 is especially close to X.46.2, which relates this story,
and X.46.2c begins gúhā cátantam (and continues with a ref. to the uśíj-; see our 5b).
I therefore think my suggestion is justified, though I am usually reluctant to supply
extraneous material. The point is &ndash; if the Gṛtsamadas (re)gain the hidden Agni, just
as their ancestors the Bhṛgus did, they will get the upper hand against their enemies.
The standard tr. must construe gúhā with vanvántaḥ ‘gaining in secret’ (e.g., Ge
14
“heimlich überbieten und uüberwinden”). Although this is the obvious way to
construe the text as given, the notion that our side would win by stealth and secret
means seems antithetic to the Rigvedic ideal of combat, whether on the battlefield or
the ritual ground. The adverb gúhā is extremely common in the flight-of-Agni myth
and in an Agni hymn would likely call to mind the whole story. I would now be
inclined to emend the publ. tr. to “(the one hiding) in secret,” not “(… deposited) in
secret,” because of its apparent dependence on X.46.2 or a passage like it.</p>
<h2 id="5">5</h2>
<p>Agni
The first seven of the eight vss. (the 8th being a summary vs.) name and
describe the various priestly roles that Agni assumes in the ritual. In all but vs. 3 the
priestly title is given; in 3 the title must be inferred from the description, which
unfortunately is somewhat muddled. See extensive disc. below.</p>
<h3 id="51">5.1</h3>
<p>On jénya- see comm. ad I.128.7.</p>
<h3 id="52">5.2</h3>
<p>The priestly subject of this vs. is the Potar, found in the final pāda, but there is
a teaser in pāda b, in the form of an agent noun nétar- ‘leader’ in the expression
yajñásya netári “to/in the leader of the sacrifice.” But netár- is not a technical
priestly role; the real priestly title derived from the root √nī is Neṣṭar, found in vs. 5
(néṣṭuḥ).</p>
<h3 id="53">5.3</h3>
<p>It is not clear what the disjunctive vā is disjoining. Klein (DGRV II.187–88)
considers vs. 3 a reformulation of vs. 2, tr. “Or (more precisely) …” But since vs. 3
most likely concerns a different priestly office than vs. 2 (brahmán- by implication,
not pótar-), this doesn’t work. No other tr. attempts to account for vā. Since Agni is
the implicit subject of these vss. and the referent of the various priestly offices, I
think that “or” is simply introducing a different role that the same Agni performs. If,
as I suggest below, the first part of vs. 3 (dadhanvé … yád īm ánu “when he has run
after it”) picks up the last part of vs. 2 (víśvaṃ tád invati “he sets all this in motion”),
the “or” might emphasize the fact that the same Agni who set the sacrifice in motion
is now switching roles to run after what he started. The “or” indicates that an
alternative Agni-figure is now in question.
The three verbs in ab, dadhanvé, vócat, and véḥ, have been configured in
every possible way. Ge takes the first two as parallel in the dependent cl. marked by
yád, with véḥ the main cl. verb (accented because it’s in the initial position of its
clause). Acdg. to Re, dadhanvé is a main verb, with vócat the verb of its associated
yád cl., while véḥ is the verb of an independent main cl. Old (SBE) takes all three as
parallel verbs in the yád cl., with c as the main cl. Like me, Klein makes vócat and
véḥ parallel main cl. verbs, with dadhanvé in the yád cl. (In his Particle u …” [p. 81]
Klein specifically takes u not only as indicating that vócat and véḥ are coordinate but
suggests it was syncopated from utá in the context … u tát.) And, finally, WG take
dadhanvé in the dependent cl., vócat in the main cl., and véḥ as 2nd sg. direct speech
specifying vócat. This chaotic diversity shows that we interpreters are uncertain not
15
only about the syntax of the verse but the sense. In what follows I will pursue this
sense, with no certainty that what I present is correct.
Ge (/WG) take the subject of dadhanvé to be the priest and īm as referring to
Agni whom the priest pursues, but, as in II.1, Agni is identified with the various
priestly functions, and I think he must be the subj. of all the verbs here. I don’t really
understand the function of dadhanvé, but it might simply express Agni’s pursuit of
the priestly role or of the formulations that he then speaks (in which case īm is better
tr. ‘them’, as is quite possible). But I would now suggest that there is continuity with
the previous vs., and that Agni in his new rule is running after “all this” (víśvaṃ tád,
probably the sacrifice or some part of it) that as Potar he set in motion. See above.
The reason that WG interpret véḥ as direct speech is to render it as a 2nd sg.;
they clearly reject the standard 3rd sg. interpr. But I do not think that a 3rd sg. can be
avoided here or in I.77.2 or IV.7.7 (WG render the former as 3rd sg. but the latter as
2nd sg.), although Gr’s assignment of the forms to an s-aor. to √vī is most likely
incorrect. (Curiously Narten does not discuss veḥ in her entry on √vī, even to reject
the s-aor. analysis.) Instead I would take veḥ (underlying ves) as the injunctive to the
root pres. of √vī, but with the substitution of -s for -t in the 3rd sg. as if it belonged to
an s-aor. or a root aor. of the type (ā́)var (2nd/3rd sg.) &ndash; keeping in mind that before
voiced sounds véḥ appears as vér and so an analogy to phonologically similar (ā́)var
would not be surprising. There are no 3rd sg. -t forms to this stem, unless augmented
ávet (V.34.8) belongs here. One of the idiomatic uses of the root √vī is with an acc.
of an office or function (see esp. I.76.4 véṣi hotrám utá potrám “You pursue the
Hotarship and the Potarship,” adduced by Ge), which is the apparent sense here, and
so assigning véḥ to a different root, such as √viṣ, should be avoided.
As noted in the intro. remark above, this vs. is the only one of the seven
“priestly role” vss. in which the priestly title is missing. Instead we must infer it from
the description of Agni’s activity. It is probably no accident that this is the only vs. in
the hymn in which the priestly title has to be inferred and supplied, since the priestly
role depicted in the vs. involves the clever manipulation of language and the capture,
via bráhmāṇi, of hidden truths. The poet is in essence making his audience act the
role of the bráhman- by figuring out what the vs. is getting at. In my opinion the
most crucial piece is pāda b, where Agni “speaks sacred formulations” (vócad
bráhmāṇi). The speaker of formulations (bráhman-) is of course the brahmán, and
this is the title we must derive from this context. That véḥ is used of the pursuit of
priestly roles (see above) but here appears without overt object also invites us to fill
in the blank in this way. Our inference is reinforced by cd pári víśvāni kā́vyā …
abhavat, where Agni encompasses “all poetic skills,” that is, the ones necessary to
produce effective formulations.
This brings us to the problem of abhavat. As IH points out to me, the recent
past sense I attribute to this verb here (“has encompassed”) would be highly unusual
for an augmented imperfect, and given the perplexing variety of verbs in the earlier
parts of the vs. (pf. dadhanvé, injunc. aor. vócat, injunc. pres. véḥ) and the
uncertainty of their syntactic distribution, not to mention the sense of the vs. as a
whole, adding to the confusion by attributing an unusual sense to abhavat should be
16
avoided if at all possible. It might be possible to read the injunctives vócat and véḥ
not as present/future as in the publ. tr., but as pasts: “… he spoke formulations and
pursued …,” which would be friendly to a simple past interpr. of abhavat “he
encompassed …” However, two things speak against this. First, the rest of the hymn
presents Agni’s occupation of the various offices in the present/recent past. And
second, injunctive forms of vóca- almost always have a performative pres.-future
sense, as in the famous and stereotyped opening of I.32.1 índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi prá
vocam “I (will) proclaim the manly deeds of Indra.” Imposing a past interpr. here
would contravene the normal usage of this form, esp. since it fits well with the
presential focus of the rest of the hymn and nothing else presses a past interpr. My
not entirely satisfactory response to this conundrum is to suggest that cd describes
Agni’s acquisition of poetic skills in the past – he is elsewhere often called a kaví- &ndash;
which allows him to assume the role of Formulator now. So I would alter the tr. to
“he encompassed all poetic skills …” Many thanks to IH for extensive discussion of
this problematic passage.</p>

<p>The standard tr. construe śúcinā with krátunā (e.g., Ge “mit lauterem Sinne”).
This is certainly possible &ndash; though śúci- krátu- is not a standard collocation &ndash; but not
necessary.
The standard tr. also assume a change of subject in cd from Agni (ab) to a
priest “who knows Agni’s vratas” (vidvā́m̐asya vratā́dhruvā́). I find this unlikely;
vidvā́n modifies Agni in vs. 8 (in my view), as well as twice in the next, closely
related, hymn (II.6.7, 8). Moreover, vidvā́n is regularly used absolutely, taking an
object much less often. I construe vratā́dhruvā́instead with ánu: “according to his
vratás.” The collocation ánu vratá- is quite common; here the vratá- would be the
rules that govern the natural world (plants and fires).</p>

<p>I take yádī as yád ī, with pronominal enclitic ī standing for ‘him’ =

Ge’s identifications, flg. Sāy., of the mother as the cow and the sister as the
offering ladle or, less likely in my opinion, the ghee offering itself, seem reasonable.
He suggests that the pl. tā́sām of c picks up a collective in the previous clause,
presumably ghee. This seems less likely to me; I suggest “the arrival of these (fem.)”
refers back to the sisters who came here (svásāro yā́idáṃ yayúḥ) in 5d.</p>

<p>The convoluted but rhetorically balanced expression sváḥ svā́ya dhā́yase
kṛṇutā́m ṛtvíg ṛtvíjam (“Let him, as Rtvij, ̥ make himself R̥tvij, to suckle himself”)
makes explicit Agni’s double role in this hymn: he is both a divine version of each
priest in turn and represents the corresponding human priest. Here as divine Ṛtvij he
makes himself into the human Ṛtvij, whose function is to give nourishment to the
ritual fire, that is, to himself &ndash; a kind of closed and reflexive circle. Once the
mechanism of the identifications that have run through the hymn has been laid bare,
17
the poet briskly finishes up the hymn, beginning with the summary 2nd hemistich
here.
Most tr. struggle to construe stómaṃ yajñáṃ ca with the closest verb, vanéma.
Somewhat against my principles, I instead take ā́d áraṃ, vanéma as parenthetical and
construe the first NP with rarimā́. (I have displaced the tr. of the ā́d clause to the
right, because the parenthetical tr. was difficult to parse.) In favor of this interpr. is
the fact that the standard tr. require ā́d to be in a highly unusual position, in the
middle of its supposed clause. As it happens, WG interpr. the syntax as I do.</p>

<p>Ge (/WG) and Re take the subj. of ab to be the sacrificer, flg. Sāy., but Agni as

the only signal of the absent imperative is the presumed 2nd ps. reference of the
repeated sá, which of course is ordinarily a 3rd ps. pronoun, but is very frequent with
2nd ps. imperatives (see my “sa figé” article, HS 1992).</p>

The verse contains several tricks involving word order. First, the first word of
the vs., víśvā(ḥ), and the last, dvíṣaḥ, belong together: “all hatreds.” Their extreme
distraction may be iconic of the distance that we must cross to pass beyond them.
Notice that they are also near rhyme forms. Further, there is a clever grammatical
switch between vss. 2 and 3: 2c ends with (utá) dviṣáḥ (abl. sg.) / 3c with dvíṣaḥ
(acc.pl.), and 3a begins with víśvā(ḥ) (utá). As just noted, this opening víśvā(ḥ) is to
be construed with the distant 3c dvíṣaḥ, not with the dviṣáḥ immediately before it &ndash;
even though they seem bracketed together, sandwiched in by utá&rsquo;s, with
phonologically similar tásyā immed. before and tváyā immed. after: tásyā utá dviṣáḥ

is one that has been mated but has not yet calved &ndash; so possibly barren, possibly not.
My tr. here, “mated cows,” is not fully accurate but far less awkward than accuracy
would require.
WG supply “verses” with aṣṭā́padībhiḥ, though they allow the possibility of a
cow in their n. Although this pun is probably lurking here &ndash; eight-footed verses

yáḥ, no longer in initial position), though of course it is entirely unrelated to the
relative. The referent of all those rel. pronouns is Agni, who is also the referent of
yaśástamasya. Phonology and syntax are thus wedded.
II.8.4–6: As the just-mentioned structural device expires in 4a, another takes its
place. An unbroken alliterative string runs from the end of 4b through the beginning
of 5: … arcíṣa / añjānó ajárair abhí // átrim ánu …, and the first words of the most
of the remaining pādas also start with a- (5b agním, 6a agnér, 6c áriṣyantaḥ, 6d

latter and think it refers to the myth of the discovery and recovery of the fugitive
Agni. The word forms a weak ring with suvidátra- in the final vs., 6a, assuming the
latter word is a derivative of √vid; see comm. ad vs. 6.
ádabdhavratapramati- is an unusual cmpd for the RV in having three
members, and with its initial accent (on which see AiG II.1.293) the accent falls
about as far from word-end as it is possible to be.</p>
<h3 id="94">9.4</h3>
<p>There is some difference of opinion about the meaning of manótar-. Most take
it as some version of ‘deviser, inventor’ (so Gr, Ge, HO [SBE], Re, WG), but Tichy
(Nomen Agentis, 40 and passim) argues for the sense ‘reminder, rememberer’. I opt
for something in the middle, ‘minder’. That is, I don’t think the term means that Agni
creates ritual speech (the standard view), nor that he remembers or reminds the
officiants of this speech (the Tichy view), but that he takes account of it, pays
attention to it. The English term ‘minder’ (as in childminder) also has the
connotation of taking care of someone or something, tending or ministering to it or
them, and that sense would fit here as well. See also comm. ad IV.5.10 citing several
passages containing the verb stem manu- that underlies this unusually formed agent
noun with the sense ‘ponder, bring to mind’.</p>
<h3 id="95">9.5</h3>
<p>Various suggestions have been made about the two types of goods in pāda a
(see the nn. of Old [SBE], Ge, Re, and WG), but Re’s suggestion that it’s lifestock
and offspring seems the most satisfying contexually, given the wishes expressed in
cd. For disc. of similar phrases see comm. ad VI.19.10.</p>
<h3 id="96">9.6</h3>
<p>As noted above, I suggest that suvidátra- makes a ring with vídāna- in 1a, a
suggestion that rests on assigning both words to the root √vid ‘find’ and on assuming
that this root meaning is still apparent in suvidátra-. Neither of these assumptions is
unchallenged. Gr assigns -vidatra- to dā1 ‘give’+ ví and glosses it ‘vertheilend’.
20
(That √dā is not otherwise found with ví speaks against this derivation.) In his brief
treatment of the word Debrunner (AiG II.2.170) gives its root etymology as √vid
with a question mark, glossing it ‘wohlwollend’. Though no doubt other
etymological suggestions have been made, I have not to my knowledge encountered
them. The standard interpr. of the semantics, however, are like Debrunner’s &ndash;
‘wohlwollend, gnädig, d’accueil favorable’, etc. Whatever the root derivation
assumed, this rather vague meaning is far from ‘find’ (or ‘know’ or ‘distribute’) and
the semantic pathway to it is unclear. Moreover, a passage like X.15.3 ā́hám pitṛ́̄n
suvidátrām̐avitsi “I have found the suvidátra- forefathers (/forefathers that are
easy/good to find)” testifies to at least a secondary connection between the form and
the root √vid ‘find’, as well as enough semantic connection remaining to allow the
phrase to function as a linguistic figure. The word is found twice in the Agni hymns
of II, once here, once in II.1.8. Both vss. also contain the word ánīka- ‘visage, face’
(though in II.1.8 admittedly not in the same clause). Especially in our passage I think
the point is that because of Agni’s shining face he is easy to find &ndash; he is the brightest
thing around.
That the next hymn (II.10), which is at least metrically paired with this one
(see comm. ad II.9-10), is also characterized by a ring linking the first and last vss.
and that the first word of the ring is also formed with a -tra-suffix (johū́tra-) lend
some support to my speculations about suvidátra- here.</p>
<h2 id="10">10</h2>
<p>Agni</p>
<h3 id="101">10.1</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the first word of the hymn, johū́tra-, forms a ring
with johavīmi, the last word. The connection between them is emphasized by the
intensive redupl. in johū́tra-; no other -tra- stems show redupl., much less intensive
reduplication. Gr (and, it seems, WG, here though not in I.118.9; II.20.3 isn’t clear)
take the stem as act. (‘laut rufend’), but a passive value makes better sense in all 3
occurrences (so Old [SBE], Ge, Re). The -tra- form in the next vs., víbhṛtra- (2d), is
likewise passive. My tr. “invoked … on every side” is based on the possibility that
the -tra- suffix evokes the -tra adverbial locatives (such as átra ‘here’), although this
may be pushing the limits (likewise my ‘dispersed in many places’ for víbhṛtra- in
2d). It does, however, work with the thematics of the first few vss.: vs. 2 urgently
begs to hear my call (hávam me, with the possessive prn. emphatically placed pādafinal), and the two occurrences of vícetāḥ ‘discriminating’ (1c, 2b) suggest that Agni
is choosing among the various sacrifices he might attend on the journey described in
2cd.</p>
<h3 id="102">10.2</h3>
<p>The urgency of the poet’s desire is conveyed by the isolated precative
śrūyā́(ḥ), the only precative to this root, hence my “may he please hear.” It also
provides a phonological template for śyāvā opening the next hemistich (2c) and,
more distantly, uttānā́yām and śiriṇāyām opening 3a and c respectively.
21</p>
<h3 id="103">10.3</h3>
<p>The fem. sg. loc. uttānā́yām is generally simply tr. ‘outstretched’ or sim. I
think the image is more precise: the two kindling sticks, athwart each other, are
likened to a woman in birthing position with her legs stretched out and open (my
“agape”).
The rhyming form śíriṇāyāṃ opening the 2nd half-vs. is much more difficult.
It is a hapax with no clear root affiliation, and the suggested tr. range widely &ndash;
‘night’, ‘chamber’, ‘hiding place’, etc. (See the standard tr., plus KEWA and EWA
s.v.) My own very tentative suggestion links it to sirā ‘stream’ (I.121.11) and sirī́- (if
that means ‘stream’, as JPB takes it, X.71.9), as well as to later sirā- ‘vein’ (also
found in MIA). By extension I take it to refer metaphorically to the birth canal, in
which Agni remains, unborn, during the night &ndash; though he cannot be kept confined
for very long. This would again be a reference to the kindling sticks, in whose
attenuated interior he is fancied to be hidden. The variation in sibilant would not be
surprising, particularly in a body-part word that could be mediated by Middle Indic.
All this is very speculative, however, and it might be wiser to leave the word
untranslated.</p>
<h3 id="104">10.4</h3>
<p>This vs. describes what happens to the fire after the peaceful creature
depicted in pāda b is sprinkled with melted butter (pāda a): he takes on an appearance
(dṛ́śānam) that is larger and more powerful. Contra Ge, Re, WG (but with Old
[SBE]) I construe ánnaiḥ with vyáciṣṭham, on the basis of III.50.1 uruvyácāḥ …
ebhír ánnaiḥ.</p>
<h3 id="105">10.5</h3>
<p>The first hemistich of this vs., which repeats the verb of the preceding vs.,
jigharmi ‘I sprinkle’, expresses the hope that this sprinkling, which rendered Agni
‘overpowering, violent’ (rabhasám) at the end of the last vs., will not make him
hostile and dangerous: he should enjoy the ghee “with an undemonic spirit”
(arakṣásā mánasā).
The second hemistich states that no matter how lovely his appearance is, he is
not to be touched; the unexpressed reason for this of course is that he will burn
whoever or whatever does touch him. The hapax bahuvr. spṛhayádvarṇa- is
variously interpreted. I think it means not ‘having desirable color’ (so, approx. Re.)
nor ‘desiring color’ (so approx. Ge and WG), but rather ‘having questing color’ &ndash;
that is, his color (=flames) flickering here and there (járbhurāṇaḥ) look in their
random motion as if they are seeking something.</p>
<h3 id="106">10.6</h3>
<p>The first pāda of this vs. continues the theme of trying to set limits on the
unpredictably powerful Agni. (In my view; it is not so interpr. by others.) Here he is
urged (again with a precative, jñeyāḥ) to know or recognize his share. I take this to
mean that he should take his share and no more, though his power would allow him
to take whatever he wants (sahasānó váreṇa). Agni thus controlled will then help the
singer to achieve his goals (pādas bcd).
Note that Manu returns from the 1st vs. — another little ring. The adj.
madhupṛ́cam ‘mixing with honey’ reminds us of the later Madhuparka drink offered
22
to distinguished visitors, but I doubt that such a reference is found here. Though it
would be generally appropriate for Agni the átithi- (‘guest’), this hospitality theme,
though common in the RV, is not found in this hymn.

<p>Indra
[II.11–24 JPB]
[II.11 Indra (misc. comments by SJ to JPB tr.)</p>
<p>The hymn has a remarkable number of predicated tense-stem participles.
Another notable feature is the large number of occurrences of the particle nú,
all in the first pāda of the vs., in short runs of adjacent vss.: 3a, 4a; 6a, 7a; 15a, 16a,
17a. The last vs. of the hymn (21) then begins nūnám, as if in summary.
On the unusual meter of this hymn see Old Prol. 87–90, who also remarks on
its unusual vocab., which, taken together, gives the hymn a “Sonderstellung” among
the surrounding hymns (87 n. 1).</p>
<h3 id="112">11.2</h3>
<p>The pf. part. vāvṛdhānáḥ would better be rendered as an anterior: “when you
had become strong …”</p>
<h3 id="113-1">11.3</h3>
<p>There are several syntactic problems in this verse. The easiest to deal with is
the apparently misplaced ca in b. All the standard tr. as well as the publ. tr. take
rudríyeṣu as a modifier of stómeṣu, with the whole loc. phrase #ukthéṣu …, stómeṣu
… rudríyeṣu ca# then interpreted as “in the hymns and in the Rudriyan praises,” with
the ca following the 2nd word of a bipartite NP and at a considerable distance from
the 1st
. (We would expect *stómeṣu ca (…) rudríyeṣu.) Klein (DGRV I.54) calls this
“the most anomalous position of ca within adjective plus noun syntagms.” This
difficulty disappears if we take rudríyeṣu not as an adjective with stómeṣu, but as a
third term in the conjoined phrase: “in the hymns, in the praises, and in the
Rudriyans.” The ca is then correctly positioned in an X Y Z ca construction (on
which see Klein DGRV I.86–91). The Rudriyans in question are the Maruts. It is
important to note that the adj. rudríya- is almost never used of anyone or anything
but the Maruts, and in the plural never of anything but the Maruts. It is also never
used of hymns or praises. It is true that my interpr. produces disharmony in semantic
class: two types of verbal products and a group of gods, but Indra does indeed get
pleasure and strengthening both from human praises and from the Maruts, who stood
by him at the Vṛtra battle. And my interpr. solves the ca placement problem and also
allows rudríya- to refer to its accustomed referent.
A more intractable problem is how to interpr. the loc. relative pronouns in a
and c. The standard tr. seem to take them (it’s a little hard to tell) as embedded
relatives with the loc. nouns (ukthéṣu, etc.) belonging to the main clause whose
predicate takes shape in pāda d. The publ. tr. (JPB) takes ab as a separate sentence,
supplying an impv. “delight!” as the main cl. verb, governing ukthéṣu … rudríyeṣu
ca and generated from the injunctive pf. cākán of the rel. cl. This still leaves the yā́su
cl. embedded, since the main clause in cd must include túbhyéd that begins c, parallel
23
to vāyáve in d. Another wrinkle is the fact that the verbal predicate of this 2nd rel.
clause is not finite, but a predicated middle participle (whatever its exact derivational
path) mandasānáḥ (on which see comm. ad IV.3.6). In favor of the JPB solution is
the fact that the yā́su rel. prn. has a clear antecedent in the main clause of cd: nom. pl.
etā́(ḥ), but it is not clear whether masc. yéṣu does. If we take the nominal loc. pls.
ukthéṣu, etc., as belonging to the main clause, then it does. This seems to be the
solution of the standard tr. (e.g., Re’s tenative “parmi (?) les hymnes en lesquels tu te
complais et parmi (?) les corps-de-louange rudriens …” I do not know the answer,
though I’m inclined to follow the standard tr., against the publ. tr., and take these
masc. locatives as belonging to the main clause, with loc. relative clauses dependent
on them, parallel to the fem. loc. in c. So, rather like Re, “Amidst the hymns, praises,
and Rudriyans in which you take (have taken? injunc. pf.) delight, these (FEM. PL.), in
which you are finding exhilaration, run forth to you …”
As the just-produced tr. shows, yet another problem is the identity of the
subject of the main clause and its verb sisrate. The subj. must be fem. because of the
etā́(ḥ) and it is either qualified as śubhrā́ḥ ‘resplendent’ or compared to entities that
are. The anomalous position of the simile particle ná is, uneasily, compatible with
either: “resplendent like Xes” or “like resplendent Xes.” Various solutions for the
identity of the subject have been suggested. The publ. tr. ‘waters’ seems the most
likely, since 1) the verb means ‘run forth, flow’, 2) the subj. must be fem. pl., 3)
śubhrá- elsewhere characterizes waters and rivers, and 4) the waters were prominent
in the immediately preceding vs., though not named, and rivers appear in 1d.
Identifying the referent of śubhrā́ḥ is complicated by the fact that this stem is the
signature word of the next vs.</p>
<h3 id="114-1">11.4</h3>
<p>The first two pādas contain two exx. of predicated pres. participles,
vardháyantaḥ and dádhānāḥ, but unfortunately it’s not clear what they are predicated
of. Ge, Re, and the publ. tr. supply “we,” which is a reasonable default, WG “diese
Lobreden,” from 3a (which does not work because ukthá- is neut. and the participles
are masc.). In any case, the referents of these participles are not directly reflected in
the rest of the verse (save perhaps for asmé ‘for us / among us’ in c), and it seems
best with the standard tr. to assume an abrupt syntactic division between ab and cd
because the subject of ab must be plural, not sg., though the intrans./pass. part.
vāvṛdhānáḥ and the adj. śubhráḥ in c show lexical and thematic continuity with the
first hemistich.
JPB takes c as an independent nominal clause. I’d be inclined, with the
standard tr., to take it with d with the pf. part. vāvṛdhānáḥ expressing anteriority and
notional dependence: “… having become strengthened, you should overwhelm …”</p>
<h3 id="115-1">11.5</h3>
<p>Pāda c is oddly conceived. The problem is the double object of the pf. part.
tastabhvā́ṃsam, namely apó dyā́m “the waters (and) heaven.” The first, in a putative
VP apó √stambh, is perfectly fine, and indeed perfectly fine as a description of Vṛtra.
Although √stambh ordinarily means ‘prop up, make fast’, in the latter sense it can
come to mean ‘stay, block’, with rivers (bzw. waters) as obj. Cf. III.53.9 ástabhnāt
24
síndhum arṇavám “he stayed the river in flood,” depicting Viśvāmitra’s feat in
stopping the rivers to allow Sudās’s forces to cross, presented at length in the famous
hymn III.33. Also, with √stambh in the passive, in VIII.96.18 tváṃ síndhūm̐asṛjas
tastabhānā́n “you released the rivers, which had been blocked/stayed,” exactly of
Indra’s freeing the waters after smiting Vṛtra, as here. But √stambh is far more
common with dyā́m as object; this VP means “prop up heaven” and is regularly used
of one of Indra’s signature cosmogonic deed – including in this sequence of Indra
hymns. Cf. in the next (very famous) hymn, II.12.2 yó dyā́m ástabhnāt sá janāsa
índraḥ “who propped up heaven, that, o peoples, is Indra”; II.15.2 dyā́m astabhāyad
bṛhántam “he propped up lofty heaven”; II.17.5 ástabhnān māyáyā dyā́m avasrásaḥ
“with his craft he propped up heaven (to keep it) from falling.” It is very strange to
assign Indra’s deed and its formulaic expression to Vṛtra. To rescue the phrase, Ge
suggests that “heaven” stands for “heaven’s light”; neither Old nor Re (whose tr. in
EVP XVII of course lacks notes) comments, nor Klein (DGRV 335), who tr. “the
one blocking the waters (and) heaven.” WG tr. “der dazu Wasser und Himmel
befestigt hat,” with further glosses in the n.: “mehrdeutig: der Wasser und Himmel
gespreizt / zur Festung gemacht / festgebunden / paralysiert hat” – none of which
helps with the anomaly of dyā́m √stambh in this context. I find it difficult to imagine
that the audience (more alert than us Western commentators), hearing dyā́ṃ
tastabhvā́ṃsam, esp. in an Indra hymn, would not immediately associate it with the
standard Indra formula and find the attribution of such a deed to Vṛtra (whom Indra
will smash in the next pāda) disturbing—twisting the perfectly acceptable apáḥ
√stambh phrase in a disconcerting direction. But I don’t quite know what to do with
this. I would certainly not suggest that they then interpreted this participial phrase to
refer to Indra – more that they were forced to rescue it by a semantic reconfiguration,
perhaps like the one Ge suggests &ndash; though nowhere else that I&rsquo;m aware of is Vṛtra
credited with blocking the light of heaven.
In any case, against the publ. tr., I would take the pf. part. as expressing
anteriority – “having blocked / who had blocked the waters and heaven.”</p>
<h3 id="117">11.7</h3>
<p>The three augmented aorists in this vs. are striking, esp. because two of them
are extremely marginal: the s-aor. seen in asvārṣṭām (√svar) is found otherwise in
the RV only as 3rd sg. ásvār in late X.148.5; áraṃsta is the only form of this s-aor. in
the RV. Both have well-attested 1st cl. present stems with the same meaning, and it is,
at first, surprising in this narrative context that we don’t find imperfects. But as IH
suggested to me, if we follow the interpr. of the hymn in the publ. intro. and in
Brereton 1985, whereby the apparent events of the mythic past—the spreading out of
the earth, the coming to rest of the mountain—actually refer to the ritual here-andnow, esp. the establishment of the fire, then the augmented aorists will force an
immediate past interpr. and therefore reveal the poet’s intent behind the apparent
recital of mythic events.
I would be inclined to take cid with sariṣyán, rather than with párvataḥ, hence
“the mountain, though about to run, has come to rest,” rather than “even the
25
mountain …” Note the use of the future participle to express past prospective value
in subordination to a preterital main verb and see comm. ad 10b below.</p>
<h3 id="118">11.8</h3>
<p>After the three augmented aorists in the previous vs. and with akrān in pāda
b, the injunctive sādi in pāda a is a little surprising, esp. since this pāda seems to
describe the same action as 7d. I wonder whether the poet is playing a trick: the
negated participle áprayuchan almost seems to have the augment we expect in *asādi
but transposed to the next word (and of course etymologically and functionally quite
distinct). Note that áprayuchan occupies the same metrical position as áprathiṣṭa in
7c (the immediately preceding hemistich) and shares the same first two syllables.
The s-aor. akrāṇ in b should be tr. “has roared” to match the other augmented
aorists in the immediate context.
The lexeme ní √prath occurs only here in the RV and, at least according to
Mon.-Wms., in all of Sanskrit. This isolation makes it all the more difficult to figure
out what is going on in pāda d, since the reference of the almost equally isolated
dhamáni- is unclear. Note the placement of the preverb ní after the verb paprathan at
the end of the verse, an almost mirror image of the opening of the vs. ní párvataḥ.
This vs.-final paprathan ní is also echoed by the end of the 1st hemistich in the next
vs. asphuran níḥ. Both verbs precede their preverbs, but despite having apparently
identical endings, -an, the first is a real 3rd pl. -an, where asphuran represents 3rd
sg. asphurat in sandhi.</p>
<h3 id="1110">11.10</h3>
<p>It is unusual to find a subjunctive nijū́rvāt in a subord. clause whose main
cl. has an imperfect intensive (ároravīt). The publ. tr. renders it as “was about to
grind down” &ndash; this seems pretty close to target, though I’d probably substitute rather
“was going to” &ndash; a past prospective. Sāy. simply glosses with a desiderative
jighāṃsatīty arthaḥ. Of course, the -āt isn’t metrically guaranteed and could have
been introduced from vájrāt at the end of 9d, so it is possible that the form was
simply injunc. níjū́rvat. Nonetheless, though the usage of the subjunctive here is
unusual, I think it can be reconciled with the function of the subjunctive more
generally. Note that its function is very much parallel to that of the future participle
sariṣyán in 7d.
The pf. part. papivā́n would be better tr. “after having drunk.” Both nijū́rvāt
and papivā́n are means of indicating anteriority here.</p>
<h3 id="1111">11.11</h3>
<p>In d JPB takes paurá as pauré out of sandhi, as a PN. In VIII.61.6 I take it
as ‘multiplier’ (of Indra) in a pun with purukṛ́t-. In VIII.50.5 a clear loc. shows the
sense that JPB wants. In V.74.4 there are three exx., one apparently a PN, the other
also apparently a pun on puru- (JPB tr. ‘muchness’). I’d be inclined here to take it in
non-PN name fashion, either as loc. “in its muchness” or modifying soma: “soma
multiplied” (to puru) or perhaps more likely, given pṛṇántaḥ in c, ‘filling’ or ‘in its
fullness’.

<p>Pāda b contains another predicated pres. participle, vardháyantaḥ.</p>
<h3 id="1114">11.14</h3>
<p>Pāda c contains yet another predicated pres. part., mandasānā́ḥ. It cannot
belong with the main cl. verb in d, pānti, because it modifies a rel. prn. yé and pānti
is unaccented. The primary ending on pānti is disturbing: the context requires a
connection with √pā ‘drink’, but that root forms a root aorist. For another such form
see I.134.5 and comm. ad loc.</p>

<p>And another &ndash; or rather the same mandasānáḥ in the nominal rel. clause

JPB supplies “be” as the verb in pāda c; I’m inclined to follow Ge (/WG) in
supplying a form of √vṛdh ‘strengthen’, generated from ávardhayaḥ beginning d. Ge
suggests the impv. vardhaya. It would also be possible simply to read ávardhayaḥ
with both pādas: “you have strengthened us in battles (and) have strengthened heaven

<p>The hapax apadhā́is probably, flg. Old (and accepted by most), an instr. of a

short resonants, risks being mistaken for a root noun to √vṛt.
Because starting fires with stones is not the standard method in the RV &ndash; it
usually involves fire sticks &ndash; I think the “between the two stones” (áśmanor antár)
probably refers to the two world halves between which fire would appear, perhaps in
addition to stones struck against each other to produce sparks. If I am correct that this
is a reference to the world-halves, it would provide some support to the claim that the
meaning ‘heaven’ for this etymon, attested in both branches of Old Iranian (asmanin both YAves and OP), was pan-Indo-Iranian, a contested claim (see EWA s.v.
áśman-, esp. p. 138).

II.12.4–5: The phrases aryáḥ puṣṭā́ni (4d) and aryáḥ puṣṭī́ḥ (5c) with ppl. and fem.

semantically or functionally. The only possible (but weak) motivations I can see for
27
the use of different stems are 1) metrical (neut. pl. puṣṭā́ni would not fit in 5c;
however, the shorter neut. pl. form puṣṭā́would), and 2) gender matching between
simile and frame. We don’t know the gender of the root noun pl. víjaḥ ‘stakes’, but it
is clearly not neut. If it is underlyingly fem., puṣṭī́ḥ would be a better match. For
aryáḥ puṣṭá-, see loc. pl. aryáḥ puṣṭéṣu in the Vṛṣākapi hymn, X.86.1. That the ppl. is
used in this phrase elsewhere suggests that the ppl. is the more idiomatic form in this

this is perfectly plausible both morphologically and contextually. However, it might
rather be taken as the loc. sg. of a devī́-type -ī-stem śṛdhī́- “does not yield to the
vaunter in his vaunting.” This makes somewhat more sense.</p>

<p>Pāda b provides a good example of cid taking Wackernagel’s position even
though the word it should limit occurs later in the vs. line. In the first pāda cid
correctly follows the word it limits, or rather the first part of the dual dvandva dyā́vā
cid … pṛthivī́“even Heaven and Earth bow to him.” But in b cid follows the abl.
śúṣmāt, while the geographical feature corresponding to H+E in a, namely párvatā(ḥ)
28
‘mountains’, is postponed. But surely the clause means “even the mountains fear his
explosiveness” (as in the publ. tr.), not “the mountains fear even his explosiveness.”</p>
<h3 id="1215">12.15</h3>
<p>As often, a pattern well established through most of a hymn gets broken, or
shaken up, at the end. Here the 3rd sg. reference to Indra in the first 14 vss. changes to
2nd sg. address, but this change isn’t immediately signaled: the vs. begins with a rel.
pronoun yáḥ that apparently matches the monotonously regular occurrence of the rel.
with 3rd ps. ref. in the rest of the hymn. Only the verb dárdarṣi in b, the last word in
its clause, shows that the pattern has been broken.
The sandhi form dudhrá is ambiguous: it can reflect either a nom. sg. dudhráḥ
with the Pp. or a loc. sg. dudhré. The publ. tr. (JPB’s) opts for the latter, a possibility
floated by both Ge (n. 15a) and Old, who does not decide. The loc. interpr. has the
advantage of allowing the oddly placed ā́cid, which would represent ā́as “Praep. mit
vorhergehendem Loc.” (Gr. 169) plus ‘even’ emphasizing that loc. Ge’s tr. follows
the nom. of the Pp, and there are arguments in favor of this interpr. &ndash; dudhráelsewhere modifies Indra (I.56.3, VI.22.4 [2 out of 5 total occurrences]), and
introducing a new personage in this vs. seems unnecessary. Like Old I can’t decide.
The main clause sá kílāsi satyáḥ “you are certainly real” is an implicit answer
to the doubt expressed in 5b utém āhur naíṣó astī́ti enam “And they say about him,
‘he does not exist.’”
The 2nd ps. reference of sá in the just quoted expression is contrary to my
rules of such reference with this pronoun &ndash; that 2nd ps. sá (etc.) is only found with
imperatives and verbs so used. But the whole structure of this hymn, with the refrain
sá janāsa índraḥ in the same metrical slot as this declaration, imposes the need for a
sá here as well.
The final pāda, suvī́rāso vidátham ā́vadema, is a variant of the standard
Gṛtsamāda Triṣṭubh refrain bṛhad vadema vidáthe suvī́rāḥ. The refrain pāda here is
found twice elsewhere (I.117.25, VIII.48.14), neither of them in Maṇḍala II or in a
Gṛtsamāda hymn. The reason for this variation isn’t clear, since the standard refrain
would fit here unproblematically. Perhaps to mark the specialness of this particular
hymn?
[II.13 Indra (misc. comments by SJ to JPB tr.)
This hymn is extremely challenging, with a discouraging number of puzzles
and no clear overall theme &ndash; though Indra’s cosmogonic activities and his help to
particular clients dominate the latter part of the hymn.</p>
<h3 id="131">13.1</h3>
<p>The standard tr. (incl. JPB) seem to assume that pári serves as a postposition
with tásyā(ḥ), but the interposition of apáḥ and, esp., the close sandhi of apás pári
make this difficult. JL suggests that apáḥ might have a double reading, as a rare
singular form of áp- ‘water’, an ablative to be read with tásyā(ḥ), and as the more
usual acc. pl., with which the pl. rel. yā́su agrees. Thus “just born from this water he
has entered the waters in which he grows strong.” But the most likely referent of
tásyā(ḥ) is the immediately preceding jánitrī, which refers to the season, so an abl. of
29
water is unlikely. That pári might form a lexeme with ā́viśat is suggested by 8c
ápariviṣṭam.
Note the alliteration in cd: pipyúṣī páyo … pīyū́ṣam prathamám, with the first
terms of each pair echoing each other. JL suggests that áṃśóḥ pīyū́ṣam prathamám is
in apposition to the páyaḥ phrase, rather than being, with most tr. incl. JPB’s, a
nominative expressing the subject of ukthyàm, anticipating tád. This would allow the
refrain to be a separate clause, as it overwhelmingly is in the rest of the hymn.</p>
<h3 id="132">13.2</h3>
<p>The pres. part. to the redupl. pres. bíbhratīḥ in a seems to contrast functionally
with the finite injunc. (prá) bharanta in b, with the former expressing the regular,
repetitive action of the waters bringing milk, while the latter expresses a one-time or at
least notably separate action.</p>
<h3 id="133">13.3</h3>
<p>Pāda a is syntactically disturbing, in that it seems to have a clear embedded
rel. cl.: ánv éko vadati yád dádāti tád, with tád the referent in the main cl.
corresponding to yád in the dependent cl. (“ … that which he gives” &ndash; so the
standard tr. incl. JPB’s). Since such constructions seem strongly disallowed in RV,
such a bald example would be striking and in fact begs for a different interpr. The
interpr. of this pāda is made more difficult by the fact that the lexeme ánu √vad is
found only here in the RV and it is not entirely clear what action is being performed.
If Sāy/Ge (et al.) are correct in identifying the first ékaḥ as the Hotar and the second
as the Adhvaryu, a possible solution emerges. The Hotar should not in fact be
“giving” anything; his job is to recite in accompaniment (an activity well conveyed
by ánu √vad) to the ritual actions. It is the Adhvaryu who gives, that is, who actually
makes the physical offering. Assuming that this division of labor already obtains in
the RV, it seems likely to me that yád dádāti begins a new sentence and is a preposed
rel. with the main cl. … éka īyate. I would tentatively tr. the hemistich “One follows
along with this speech. the (other) one hastens when he gives that [=soma/oblation],
changing its forms, having that as his work.” If yád is rather taken as the neut. rel.
pron., the tr. can be modified to “What he gives, he hastens to that, having that as his
work …” My working assumption is that the independent tád is coreferential with
the tád in the cmpd tád-apas-.</p>
<h3 id="134">13.4</h3>
<p>Contra the standard tr. (incl. JPB’s) I wonder if vibhájanta āsate has √ās ‘sit’
in auxiliary function as later: “keep Xing” (in this case “keep distributing”) rather
than having the literal sense “they sit, distributing.”
I am baffled by pāda b.</p>
<h3 id="135">13.5</h3>
<p>In the causative infinitival phrase akṛṇoḥ pṛthivī́ṃ saṃdṛ́śe divé, Re and WG
take dat. heaven as subj. and acc. earth as obj. of the dat. infinitive, in contrast to the
publ. tr. and Ge. Since the usual obj. of the infinitive dṛśé is the sun, the Ge/JPB
interpr. seems more likely, in that it also involves looking heavenward. Note also that
in 8ab the datives pṛkṣā́ya and dāsáveśāya are objects of the dative infin. níhantave,
with the same syntactic pattern as is suggested here. There is also an occurrence of
30
the same stem saṃdṛ́ś- in the acc. pl. in 10c, but this seems to have no clear
relationship to the dative here and is, in any case, quite opaque.</p>
<h3 id="136">13.6</h3>
<p>With Klein (DGRV I.135, etc.), I take the double ca as conjoining
morphologically parallel bhójanam and várdhanam, despite the preposed position of
the 2nd ca. This preposing would be supported by 7a where a correctly positioned
second ca in a double ca construction is found in the same metrical position and
before an almost rhyming final word, dhármaṇā.
Because of the accent on dudóhitha, pāda b must continue the relative cl. of
pāda a, rather than serving as its main cl. as in the publ. tr., which should be
corrected to “You, who distribute … and who have milked &hellip;, / you have hidden …”
I’m inclined to take the loc. vivásvati here as “bei/chez Vivasvant” rather than
“in Vivasvant” as in the publ. tr. That is, Indra set down a treasure in the vicinity of
Vivasvant, presumably as a reward for V’s sacrifice, rather than within his body.
JL points out the complex mirror-image figure that straddles the pāda break in
cd: #sá … dadhiṣe vivásvati, víśvasyaíka īśiṣe sá … The two interior elements,
vivásvati and víśvasyaíka(ḥ), are phonologically similar and isosyllabic; they are
flanked by 2nd sg. mid. perfects with rhyming ending -iṣe; and the pronoun sá with
2nd sg. reference provides an outer ring.</p>
<h3 id="137">13.7</h3>
<p>dā́na- in b is almost universally taken as ‘pasture’ (Weide) or ‘earth’ (Re ‘sur
terre’), a meaning attributed to dā́na- only in this passage. The interpr. goes back,
one way or the other, to Sāy: upalūyante sasyāny atreti dānaṃ kṣetram. His remark
“grain is cut there” implies a connection with √dā ‘reap, mow’ (EWA’s DĀ2
). His
gloss ‘field’ (dānaṃ kṣetram) is repeated thereafter, most influentially in BR, though
they seem to derive the word from √dā ‘divide’ (EWA’s DĀ4
); subsequent adoptors
of the gloss do not bother to comment on the etymology. Sāy’s implied derivation
from √dā ‘reap’ is appealing. There are several clear exx. of the root pres. of this
root in the RV (grouped under Gr’s 2. dā), as well as nominal derivatives (see EWA
s.v. DĀ2
). The reference in this vs. to the establishment of flowering and fruitful
plants would have helped preserve a lexical item specific to agriculture, even though
it is homonymous with the more common dā́na- ‘gift’ (and see differently accented
dānā́ya ‘to give, for giving’ in 13a).
I wonder, however, about the concrete locational sense that Sāy gives it; it
might make more sense as an abstract ‘in their reaping’. The vs. seems to depict
Indra as the orderer of the cosmos, with the solemn etymological figure dhármaṇā …
ádhārayaḥ “you established by your establishment” (or without English cognate
expression, “you established by your ordinance”). (I would not follow JPB’s
attribution of the dhárman- to the plants: “according to the foundation (of each).”)
Most of the hemistich would then show Indra creating the various plants in their
crucial function, to be harvested. (The presence of ádhi might be counter-evidence to
my interpr., in that it generally has a locational sense, but I’m not certain that this is
enough to derail it.)
31
I further think that the last bit of the hemistich, vy àvánīr ádhārayaḥ, is a
somewhat separate expression. That is, I read ádhārayaḥ without preverb with the
“plants” segment in pāda a / first part of b (thus not flg. JPB’s “established separately
the flowering and fruitful (plants)”), and restrict ví … ádhārayaḥ to the streams of
the end of b; its position after the caesura in b favors this syntactic separation. If this
interpr. is correct, the problematic dā́ne may require further analysis, for in addition
to ‘in their reaping’ for the first part of the hemistich (to √dā ‘reap’) it could also be
taken as a derivative of √dā ‘divide’, as JPB does: ‘in their division’. It is ideally
positioned to be read with both.
I would thus tr. the hemistich “You who established by your ordinance the
flowering and fruitful (plants) in their reaping (and) established the (various) streams
separately in their division.” Indra’s division of undifferentiated water into separate
streams would be part of his fructifying project &ndash; bringing life-giving water to the
various terrestrial regions.
Having created the relevant features of the earth &ndash; plants and streams &ndash; in ab,
Indra then turns to a particular heavenly feature, the didyút-s. What exactly is meant
here isn’t clear. The stem didyút-, like its near-twin didyú-, generally means ‘missile,
dart’, but often a missile sent flying from heaven by a god (cf., e.g., VII.46.3 [Rudra]
yā́te didyúd ávasṛṣṭā divás pári “which missile of yours shot downward from heaven
…”). As Mayrhofer points out (EWA s.v. didyú-), didyút- has probably been
remodeled after √dyot or vidyút- ‘lightning’ (I’d favor the latter). And often it seems
to have a naturalistic aspect, as lightning (or the dreaded ‘thunderbolt’ of oldfashioned Vedic exegesis). Here the naturalistic reading seems esp. prominent, and I
suggest that ásama- ‘unequalled’ may also have the sense ‘unequal’ &ndash; that is, jagged
and asymmetrical, zigzaging like lightning.
The last difficulty of this challenging verse is the first part of d, urúr ūrvā́m̐
abhítaḥ. Ge (/WG) and the publ. tr. take this as an independent nominal clause (e.g.,
JPB: “you, the wide one surrounding the containers”). Given the cosmogonic cast of
the rest of the vs., I would follow Re, who takes ūrvā́n as a 2nd object of ájanaḥ in c:
“(qui,) vaste (toi-même, as engendré) les mers tout autours.” Although ūrvá-, lit.
‘container’, generally refers to cow-pens and the like in the RV, Re’s ‘seas’ (as
particularly large containers) seems correct here; cf. the same usage, also in Maṇḍala
II, in II.35.3, where the rivers all fill “the same ūrvá-” (samānám ūrváṃ nadyàḥ
pṛṇanti). I would thus tr. cd “and who begot the unequal(led) flashing missiles of
heaven (and) the ‘containers’ [=seas] all about, (you) the wide one.” The
juxtaposition urúr ūrvā́n is a play on words; the two are not etymologically related, at
least by most lights.
What is striking about this vs. is that, unlike the usual cosmogonic vss., which
refer to large generic parts of creation (heaven, earth, etc.), this one highlights
particular idiosyncratic aspects of the grand cosmic divisions.</p>
<h3 id="138">13.8</h3>
<p>To avoid the need to supply additional unsupported material (JPB’s “would
do likewise”) to the brief beginning of pāda d utaívā́dyá purukṛt, I interpr. purukṛt as
a predicated voc. (“and even today (you are) a much-doer”), with most tr.
32</p>
<h3 id="139">13.9</h3>
<p>The syntax of the 1st hemistich is intricate and hard to parse. The first rel. cl.
(… yásya …) extends through ékasya śruṣṭaú, with yásya coreferential with ékasya.
This clause is in turn dependent on the short yád clause yád dha codám ā́vitha, with
codám the referent of yásya. The standard tr. take codá- as a personal name, but this
is not necessary, as Mayrhofer (PN s.v.) points out &ndash; and in fact it would be better
not to have another name for Dabhīti (c), who is the ultimate referent of both yásya
(a) and codám (b).
Note that ā́diya(ḥ) at the end of b matches āsíyam at end of 8c.</p>
<h3 id="1310">13.10</h3>
<p>Although víśved … rodhanā́(ḥ) must belong together semantically, it is
difficult to make this work grammatically: rodhanā́in this sandhi pos. can’t be neut.
-ā, but must stand for -ā(ḥ) &ndash; so Pp. &ndash; (or, far less likely, -ai). It therefore can’t
properly be modified by a víśvā extracted from víśvéd. Old sees the problem, but Gr
simply lists the form as neut. -ā; Ge [/WG], Re don’t mention and tr. as a phrase. The
sandhi of either víśvéd or rodhanā́asya has to be tampered with to harmonize the two
words; I have no opinion on how to make this work. The only other RVic occurrence
of the noun is differently accented: ródhanā, a neut. pl. (I.121.7); AiG II.2.190
considers our form a fem. stem rodhanā́- beside root-accented neut. ródhana-, acdg.
to an existing pattern.
The awkward doubling of asya … asmai should be noted in the tr.: “… have
conceded his manliness to him,” with both pronouns referring to Indra. Perhaps the
asya is there because most exx. of ánu √dā ‘concede’ involve the subject conceding
some quality of its/his own to a third party, so the fact that the paúṃsya- is Indra’s to
begin with needs to be emphasized.
I have no idea what the second hemistich is about, except that it obviously
involves some cosmogonic activity and the viṣṭíraḥ and the saṃdṛ́śaḥ are implicitly
contrasted. In d pári paró shows phonetic play, but I do not understand the function
of paráḥ here.</p>
<h3 id="1311">13.11</h3>
<p>The first pāda, supravācanáṃ táva vīra vīryàm, is a nominalization of the
famous opening of I.32 (found in various forms elsewhere): índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi prá
vocam. In that hymn this opening is followed by the account of an undoubted heroic
deed, the slaying of Vṛtra. Here the specification in b, introduced by yád (as often in
such proclamations) followed by a promisingly heroic ékena krátunā “by your
resolve alone,” turns out to be something of an anticlimax: you find goods. This lack
of drama is somewhat repaired by d, which sketches a larger world of great deeds.
Unfortunately, however, the syntax of d is disturbing. The rel. cl. of d is
universally tr. (incl. by JPB) “all the things you have done,” but “all” (víśvā) is not
part of the rel. cl. (yā́cakártha). It has instead been stuck in the refrain, which only in
this verse has been altered from sā́si ukthyàḥ (2-10d, 12d) to séndra víśvāsi ukthyàḥ.
Dropping a piece of a rel. cl. into the middle of a main cl. is simply impossible in the
RV. It is possible to interpr. víśvā as a real part of the main cl., an acc. of respect:
“What (deeds) you have done, you are worthy of hymns with regard to all of them.”
33
But somehow I doubt that’s what the poet intended &ndash; though what his intentions
were, esp. given the deliberate alteration of the refrain, are opaque to me.
Another possible wrinkle in d is that yā́need not be the neut. pl. of the rel.,
illegally anticipating the víśvā intruding in the refrain. It could be an instr. sg. picking
up váyaḥ in the preceding pāda: “… the vigor by which you have done …”</p>
<h3 id="1312">13.12</h3>
<p>The use of the secondarily shortened stem śraváya- here instead of inherited
śrāváya- may have been favored by the similarly short-root-vowel áramayaḥ at the
beginning of this vs. (which stem comes by its short root vowel honestly) and by the
denom. śravasyá- in the next vs. More problematic is what prá … śraváyan is
conveying here. One might think that what the blind and the lame want is not fame
but healing. Some such consideration must have led Gr to assign this form (and
prā́śrāvayam X.49.8) to a different root śru and a different idiom prá √śru ‘vorwärts
bringen’. I see no justification for such a separation. It is possible that the causative
here means (as it can elsewhere) ‘make hear/heed’ rather than ‘make heard/famed’,
though this wouldn’t appreciably improve the situation of the blind and lame. Or that
in the idiom prá √śru, the prá came to dominate, with a sense ‘further, favor
(through fame)’.</p>
<h3 id="1313">13.13</h3>
<p>The last puzzle in the hymn is found in pāda c and also involves fame. We
have just urged Indra to to give us a rā́dhaḥ (‘gift, benefit’) in the first hemistich. In c
we find the phrase yác citráṃ śravasyā́(ḥ). Since citrá- very frequently modifies
rā́dhaḥ, it seems natural to supply the recently mentioned rā́dhaḥ here. But then what
is Indra doing? yác citrám appears to be the obj. of śravasyā́(ḥ). But this denom.
doesn’t otherwise take an object (IV.42.2 cited by Gr is to be otherwise interpr.), and
even if it did, the phrase would have to mean “which bright (gift) you will seek as
fame,” which doesn’t seem to make sense. Ge essentially tr. it this way (“… eine
ansehnliche (Lohngabe) … in der du … deinen Ruhm suchen”), but I don’t see why
Indra would be looking for his fame in that direction. JPB avoids the syntactic
difficulty by tr. as if yác citrám were an instr.: “the bright gift through which you will
seek fame” (my italics), but this still requires the gift to be something that would
provide Indra with fame. Re’s tendency to supply masses of material to smoothe over
the rough places is on full display here: “ce qui est éclatant, veuille le donner-pardésir de-renom” (so hyphenated). WG seem to have arrived at a novel solution,
apparently separating citrám from its usual formulaic partner rā́dhas and supplying
śrávas- ‘fame’ &ndash; or so I interpret “damit du … deinen ansehnlichen Ruhm suchen
mögest.” However, as far as I can tell, śrávas- is never modified by citrá-, and
context favors rā́dhas- as referent. I have no solution. The least unsatisfactory may
be to assume that, in our self-serving way, we are telling Indra that giving us a good
gift will bring him fame (better than heroic deeds? see 11ab) &ndash; and in some sense it
will, since we celebrate his generosity with hymns providing lasting śrávas-.

<p>In c I take the phrase jāténa jātám as expressing an essentially hostile
relationship between adversaries: he extends beyond the offspring (of his competitor)
with his own offspring. This interpr. would match the similar configuration of
etymological figures in 2a vīrébhir vīrā́n vanavad vanuṣyatáḥ “With his heroes he
will win against the heroes who seek to win,” which in turn expands the etymological
figure in vanavad vanuṣyatáḥ in 1a. The standard tr. take both elements in jāténa
jātám as referring to the offspring of the subject: “he will extend beyond his
offspring with (more) offspring” or “offspring after offspring.” However, the strong
parallel in 2a makes this less likely in my opinion.</p>
<h3 id="252">25.2</h3>
<p>Ge, Re, Schmidt (Bṛhaspati und Indra, 113) take pres. act. part. vanuṣyatáḥ
here as gen. sg. dependent on acc. pl. vīrā́n (e.g., Schmidt “… die Mannen des
Angreifenden”). I find this extremely unlikely, given that the same word in the same
etymological figure in 1a and in the following hymn, II.26.1a, must be acc. pl. The
acc. pl. ṛghāyatáḥ at the end of 3a with the same morphological structure also
supports this analysis.</p>

<p>With Ge, Re, and WG, I take ṛjúr íc cháṃsaḥ as a severed bahuvrīhi, like
nárā ca śáṃsam (IX.96.42, cf. X.64.3), with accent and case ending adjusted. For a
similar formation, still compounded, see V.44.5 ṛjugātha ‘o you whose song is
straight on target’. It would be possible, however, to take the text as given and make
a “straight laud” the subject, as a sort of metonymy; so Schmidt (B+I 115).</p>
<h3 id="262">26.2</h3>
<p>The impv. vihi, with short root vowel (also III.21.5, IV.48.1, and possibly
VI.48.17), must belong to the root pres. of √vī ‘pursue’, whose properly formed 2nd
sg. impv. is vīhí (7x). The easiest way to explain its short vowel is by analogy to ihí
35
belonging to the root pres. to √i ‘go’, with pres. indic. émi, éṣi, éti, and impv. étu, all
strikingly well attested, which match vémi, véṣi, véti, and vétu.
Its object, manāyatáḥ, is ambiguous and for that reason its referent is not
clear. Its base manā́- means something like ‘zeal’, a meaning found also in other
derivatives to it, but zeal can be positively or negatively viewed; for a negative
occurrence see nearby II.33.5. In our passage Gr, Re, and Ge [/WG] take it
positively, referring to gods (Gr, Re) or priests (Ge), while Schmidt (B+I 115), flg.
Ludwig, negatively, referring to enemies. My tr. is meant to be neutral, since I think
both are simultaneously possible.</p>

<p>On the apparent bad cadence produced by ávidhat see comm. ad II.1.7.
The curious long final of rákṣatī is not remarked on by the standard

the enclitic acc. pronoun related to īm, which latter follows the first, parallel verb in
the pāda, uruṣyáti + īm. They would show a phonologically motivated distribution
here, with īm before vowel and ī before consonant, and would be positioned
identically, immediately after a clause-initial verb and before an ablative.

<p>The sequence in pāda c, abhikṣattā́ro abhí ca kṣámadhvam, invites interpr. as
an etymological figure, but the agent noun, as it stands, must belong to √kṣad ‘mete
out, apportion.’ Old tentatively suggests an emendation to abhikṣantā́r- (√kṣam),
though he also allows that the transmitted reading may be correct and the poet is
playing with Gleichklang. This seems the better course, esp. given that the stem is
found once elsewhere (VII.21.8), though abhí is not otherwise attested with this root.
It’s worth noting that abhí √kṣam is found only in this little group of hymns (II.28.3,
II.33.1, 7, in addition to this).
The reason for the accent on the main verbs (abhí …) kṣámadhvam …
mṛḷáyata is not entirely clear, since neither begins its clause or pāda and they are not
subordinated. They must be implicitly contrasted in some way, but,
impressionistically, other such sequences are not accented.
The three ca’s in cd signal two differerent conjunctions. The first, in the
preverb + verb sequence abhí ca kṣámadhvam, conjoins this impv. with mṛḷáyata in
d, in an inverse ca construction (X ca … Y); the 2nd two, in d, conjoin the temporal
expressions adyā́ca … aparáṃ ca. This is Klein’s view as well (DGRV I.188, 190,
155; cf. II.39).</p>

satisfactory to me, and though Old discusses the passage at some length, he
ultimately suggests with some despair that madhyama-váh- is an unknown technical
term in Fahrkunst. Given the unconvincing solutions suggested by others, I am
inclined towards Re’s quite different interpr.: he takes ṛté as the postposition/adv.
‘without’ and construes it with vaḥ. Old had already argued against the “without”
interpr., on the grounds that there is no ablative and that ṛté bhūt occurs also at pāda
end in VI.67.8 (where, however, I interpr. it as I do here). And, though vaḥ is not
technically an ablative enclitic, it is fairly all-purpose in terms of case. Its distance
from ṛté can be attributed to its taking Wackernagel’s position. With a “without”
interpr. the rest of the pāda falls out: we do not wish for our chariot to be without
you; madhyama-váh- then specifies where the chariot is traveling, possibly “in the
middle of its journey” or “in the middle of a battle.” (Though I enthusiastically adopt
Re’s analysis of ṛté, I am not at all convinced by his interpr. of this compound: he
thinks madhyama- refers to a middling number of draft animals.) If the vaḥ … ṛté
interpr. is rejected, the negative concept that prompts the mā́prohibitive must rest in
the cmpd. madhyama-váh- and specifically in the 1st member madhyama-. Old lays
out some possibilities, crisply summarized by Scar (475). I would assume in this case
that ‘middle’ refers to a middling or less than full effort or a position in the middle,
rather than at the forefront. So I would consider an alternative translation “let your
chariot not be traveling in a middling way / in the middle (of the pack) with regard to
truth.” Although most X-váh- cmpds mean ‘drawing/conveying X’ (e.g., the
lexicalized anaḍváh- ‘ox’ &lt; ‘pulling a wagon’; indra-váh- ‘conveying Indra’), I don’t
see how to get a direct obj. interpr. out of maddyama-.</p>
<h3 id="295">29.5</h3>
<p>In b we expect the simile “like a father his son”; instead we get the father, but
a gambler in the place of the son. We must infer the filial relationship. (The distress
of his family, including his father, over the fall of their gambler kin is depicted in
X.34.4. Nonetheless the pairing here is peculiar.)
The expected son then appears in d. The purport of this pāda is clear &ndash; the
speaker asks that only he be punished for his offenses, not his son &ndash; until we get to
the simile. Why does the poet liken himself to a bird, and what can be supplied in the
simile to match putré? The standard tr. conclude, reasonably enough, that the
comparison involves baby birds (or maybe eggs?) (e.g., Re “Ne me saisissez pas en
(la personne de mon) fils, comme (on saisit) un oiseau (en s’emparant de ses
petits).”). But is this meant to imply that bird parents get more upset by the loss of
their offspring than other animal parents do? or that robbing birds’ nests was a
particular prominent practice? I am baffled. It is possible that the simile only has
domain over the acc. mā, with no involvement of the loc. putré: “do not seize me like
a bird” &ndash; expressing the trapping/snaring techniques of bird-catching. But this
doesn’t make much sense either.

II.30 Indra and other divinities
This hymn has at least three, possibly four modern ling. features: conditional
(ábhariṣyat vs. 2), future impv (kṛṇutāt vs. 5 [though the fut. impv. appears to be
inherited, it is fairly rare in the RV and generally seems to belong to a more
colloquial speech level]), gerund (abhikhyā́ya, hatvī́vss. 9, 10), and mid. subj. in -ai
(naśāmahai vs. 11).</p>
<h3 id="301">30.1</h3>
<p>The ceaseless movement of the waters is clearly expressed in the first
hemistich, and the question posed in the last pāda is a leading one, at least in my
view. It asks at what (temporal) distance, i.e., how long ago, did the waters first start
this movement. The implicit answer is “when they were released from Vṛtra’s hold,”
which prepares for the account of the Indra-Vṛtra battle in the next vss. (On the
unexpected long vowel in kíyāti, see comm. ad I.143.3.)
The problematic pāda is c, and this is in great part because of the uncertain
interpr. of aktúḥ. Ordinarily this word means ‘night’, but since “the night of the
waters” is a curious expression, most comm. instead implictly derive it from √añj
and tr. ‘color’ vel sim. (e.g., Ge “das Farbenspiel der Gewässer”). With Old I take
the word in its usual meaning ‘night’, contrasted with the āmreḍita áhar-ahar “day
after day.” However, I think the expression “night of the waters” is used
metaphorically and perhaps has oppositional semantics. The waters are often, esp. in
treatments of the Vala myth, identified with the dawns. Here, perhaps, “night” is
meant to evoke its opposite, “dawn” (a poetic device we’ve seen elsewhere, e.g.,
I.103.7; see publ. intro. to I.103 and comm. ad loc.) and the whole expresses the fact
that just as the waters keep flowing, so also do the dawns keep dawning. This interpr.
may be too radical, however, and the point of the image may simply be how dark
waters can look compared to the sky at dawn (or dusk) &ndash; the “night of the waters” is
this dark appearance under certain lighting conditions.</p>
<h3 id="302">30.2</h3>
<p>The first hemistich of this vs. is desperately obscure. It is unclear what is
being done to or for Vṛtra in pāda a, much less who is doing it, and the identity of the
feminine subject in b is likewise left open. The function of ábhariṣyat, the only
conditional in the RV, is uncertain, and also, though this is the least of our problems,
whether the verb is ā + ábhariṣyat or is simply an augmented form without preverb
(latter Pp.). The unclear meaning of the rare word sína- simply adds to the
difficulties.
Let us start with the last one first: the stem sína- occurs twice in the RV (here
and III.62.1, also as object of √bhṛ with dat. complement), as well as in the cmpd.
tát-sina- (I.61.4) and the deriv. sínavant- (X.102.11). As indicated in EWA s.v., its
root affiliation depends on what we think it means, and what we think it means
depends to some extent on what root we ascribe it to. I will not rehearse the various
38
suggestions; suffice it to say that I think it belongs with √sā ‘bind, tie’ and refers to
material tied down on a wagon vel sim., a load &ndash; equipment and the like &ndash; hence my
‘gear’. (For a similar semantic development of a derivative of a different root
meaning ‘tie’, see my “Sanskrit pāriṇāhya ‘household goods’: Semantic evolution in
cultural context,” Fs. E. Hamp [ed. D.Q. Adams], 1997, pp. 139-145.) In this I follow
Old.
I also follow Old in my interp. of the rest of the pāda. Someone was going to
bring equipment for Vṛtra (hence the conditional, as a contrary-to-fact), but was
impeded by the action of the main clause in b: a female, identified as a generatrix
(jánitrī) foils the plot by announcing it to a wise or knowing one (vidúṣe). That
ábhariṣyat is the only conditional form attested before the Brāhmaṇas (so Whitney)
must mean that it carries a very particular force, one that could not be easily
expressed by more standard parts of the verbal system.
The potential identities of these actors takes us yet another step into the
speculative wilderness. I very tentatively suggest that the potential accomplice of
Vṛtra is Sūrya. There are two, rather shaky reasons for this suggestion: There is some
evidence in the Rig Veda for enmity between Indra and Sūrya, particularly in the
(alas fragmentary) myth where Indra in conjunction with Kutsa steals the wheel of
the sun. This hostility is also found, more developed, in the Mahābhārata, as is well
known. And within the vs. itself there is a possible reference to Sūrya in pāda c, in
the phrase pathó rádantīḥ … asmai “excavating the paths for him.” Elsewhere in the
RV Sūrya is the beneficiary of similar actions: VII.60.4 [sū́ryaḥ &hellip;] yásmā ādityā́
ádhvano rádanti, VII.87.1 rádat pathó váruṇaḥ sū́ryāya. Although I know of no other
evidence for Sūrya attempting an intervention on Vṛtra’s behalf, I nonetheless
tentatively supply him as subject of pāda a. The mother figure described as jánitrī in
b could be the Earth, as sometimes (I.185.6, III.31.2), or Indra’s own mother (as in
III.48.2, X.134.1). I have more confidence in Indra as the referent of vidúṣe
‘knowing’.
As just noted, I think Sūrya may be the referent of asmai in pāda c &ndash; or rather
one referent, for I think the pāda is deliberately ambiguous. If I am right that Sūrya is
the covert subject of pāda a, then the phraseological parallels to the “excavating
paths” expression that have Sūrya as beneficiary would suggest him as referent of
asmai. The feminine pl. agents could be the dawns, who make the path for the rising
sun. But in the context of the Vṛtra battle that forms the subject of the first vss. of
this hymn, this pāda may refer to the paths dug out by the waters when they were
released from Vṛtra, with asmai referring to Indra. Both dawns and waters are
potential subjects: the phraseology of pāda d would fit either (or both). Both waters
and dawns go to their goal (cf. I.158.6 for waters, III.61.3 for dawns). Although
dhúni- ‘boisterous’ seems more suitable for waters than dawns (cf. dhúnimant- 2x of
waters, dhunayanta once with rivers as subj.), the emphasis on dailiness (divé-dive)
might point rather to the dawns. In short, at least the second half-vs. seems
deliberately ambiguous, with potentially double referents both for the female subject
and the masc. beneficiary.
39
I have no confidence that my interpr. of this vs. is correct, but I find the other
published attempts even less convincing. However, IH has suggested an alternative
interpr. to me (p.c.) that is definitely worth considering. In this scenario the sínam
‘equipment’ is Indra’s mace, his ‘(fighting) gear’ (so IH), brought to him (=Indra)
against Vṛtra. Dat. vṛtrā́ya here would be a dative of malefit, as it were, exactly as it
is in the next vs., 3b. The bringer of the sínam could be Tvaṣṭar or even Uśanā
Kāvya, two regular suppliers of the mace to Indra. In b the jánitrī could be Vṛtra’s
mother, whom we memorably meet in I.32.9, and the knowing one (vidúṣe) Vṛtra
himself, with the participle possibly proleptic.
The potential drawback to this interpr. is that we know that Indra did get the
mace and smash Vṛtra, so the hypothetical value of the conditional isn’t
accommodated. But since we don’t actually know what the value of the conditional
was in the RV, this should not deter us. Alternatively there may have been a previous
episode in the myth in which Indra’s first attempt was thwarted when Vṛtra was
tipped off. A revised tr. of the hemistich acdg. to this scenario would be “The one
[=Tvaṣṭar? / UK?] who was going to carry the gear here for [=against] Vr̥tra &ndash; the
mother [Vṛtra’s mother] announced him to the knowing one [=Vṛtra?].”
On divé-dive see comm. ad 11 below.</p>
<h3 id="303">30.3</h3>
<p>This vs. is a fairly straightforward account of the Indra-Vṛtra battle, though
Indra’s name doesn’t appear until the last word.
I don’t quite understand the function of hí in pāda a. If it is causal (a value I
always try to impose on hí), it may take up 2b: we know (at least in one interpr. of vs.
2) that Indra already knew (2b vidúṣe) about the trickery before the mother’s
announcement, because he had already taken his position in the midspace. But this
may be over-thinking hí. The hí in c is even harder to account for, and I wonder if it
isn’t there to provide a mirror-image figure: míham … hī́m á(dudrot) and to serve as
hiatus breaker between úpa and īm. IH offers an alternative explanation for the two
hí’s. In IH’s account of RVic verbal function, aorists in subordinate clauses express
anteriority. Here the hí would be a fine expression of post hoc, ergo propter hoc, with
sequential events acquiring a causal cast: “because he had taken his stand, he bore
down his weapon” and “because he had run up to him, he conquered …”
In b vṛtrā́ya ACC prá √bhṛ echoes 2a vṛtrā́ya ACC √bhṛ. In my interpr. these
expressions are contrastive and have different subjects and different intents (though
see IH’s interpr. above): in 2a the dat. vṛtrā́ya is a dative of benefit, in 3b a dative of,
as it were, malefit. The same vajrā́ya WEAPON prá √bhṛ as 3b is found in I.61.12.
The prá √bhṛ expression may be slyly alluded to even in our vs. 2, where prá opens
pāda b and is therefore adjacent to ábhariṣyat pāda-final in a, even though it is
construed with uvāca at the end of b.
In c Vṛtra must be the subj., even though it breaks the pattern: Indra is the
unexpressed subj. of a and b and postposed subj. of d. However, Vṛtra has a penchant
for mist (e.g., I.32.13, V.32.4), and in this context it would uniquely identify him.
40</p>
<h3 id="304">30.4</h3>
<p>The vs. is nicely framed with vocc., #bṛ́haspate … indra#, thus inviting their
identification.
Ge (/WG) take vṛ́kadvaras- as a PN, but Wackernagel’s explan. (KlSchr.
325–26), adducing Aves. duuar, a daevic way of moving, is quite convincing.
ardhám √kṛ ‘go halves’ (also VI.44.18) strikes me as an idiomatic or slangy
expression, which may fit with the rare (and also possibly lower-register) future
impv. kṛṇutāt.</p>
<h3 id="306">30.6</h3>
<p>WG tr. radhrásya … yájamānasya as “des ermatteten Opferers” and further
explain that sacrificing under the hot South Asian sun is exhausting. But surely the
point is rather that even a resolute enemy gets slammed down by Indra and Soma
(pāda a), while even a weakling gets pepped up if he performs sacrifice to them.</p>
<h3 id="307">30.7</h3>
<p>tandran is, of course, a curious form. The Pp., not surprisingly, reads tandrat
(with -t à -n before ná). Gr emends this to *tandat; Whitney (Rts) list the form thus,
though with ?; and Old allows it as a possibility, without exactly endorsing it. IH
suggests following the Saṃhitā reading and interpreting it as a 3rd pl. med. root aor.,
with ending -ran. The only other verbal form to this root, tandate, is medial. If this is
correct, there would seem to be a change of no. in the subj. from the impersonal 3rd
sgs. of the standard tr. to an unspecified 3rd pl.: “It will not tire nor weary me, and
they will not flag.” Who the plural subject might be is unclear &ndash; perhaps the 1st plural
that is found in the next pāda. And in fact all three verbs could be 3rd pl.: the Pp. 3rd
sgs. tamat and śramat also appear immediately before n-, with Saṃhitā -an. Under
this interpretation the forms would not be impersonal but have unspecified plural
subj.: “they will/do not tire or weary me nor do they flag.” If we prefer to accept the
emendation to *tandat, the -r- can be explained, with Gr., as adopted from the
nominal derivatives (á-)tandra- and tandra(yú-) (cf. also AV tandrī́-).</p>
<h3 id="308">30.8</h3>
<p>Note that pāda a is modeled exactly on 6c.</p>
<h3 id="309">30.9</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) supply a verb as the 1st member of the disjunctive utá vā constr.,
contrasting with jighatnúḥ (“Wenn uns ein Unbekannter (nachstellt), oder töten will
…”), invoking VI.5.4 with yó naḥ sánutyo abhidā́sat … But more salient in VI.5.4 is
the contrastive pair yáḥ … sánutyaḥ … yó ántaraḥ … Therefore, flg. Schmidt (B+I
81; also Klein DGRV II.171), I supply yó ántaraḥ as the 2nd part of the disjunctive
phrase. Re actually proposes a clever variation on the “distant … near” contrast,
pairing abhikhā́ya, which he renders “(regandant) en face,” with sánutyaḥ. This
avoids the need to supply additional material, but employing the rare gerund simply
as a polar term with ‘distant’ seems unlikely.
As Gr points out, the idiom ‘hand over, deliver’ is characteristic of pári √dā,
not pári √dhā, which generally means ‘clothe, surround’. He suggests that this sense
of pári √dhā is attributable to “Verwechslung mit dā.” In a quick scan of the Gr’s
conspectus of dhā forms, I found only one example of pári √dhā ‘deliver’, namely
41
our pári dhehi. I wonder if dhehi for *dehi is a nonce hypercorrection, for a form that
appeared to have undergone Grassmann’s Law because of the -hi ending.</p>
<h3 id="3010">30.10</h3>
<p>The literal meaning of ánudhūpita- is fairly clear, ‘besmoked’, but there is
disagreement about its sense. Gr suggests that it means ‘puffed up, arrogant’, while
Ge (/WG) think it refers to besieging enemy strongholds with fire and smoke. (If this
were the case, one would think “a long time” was the wrong qualifier: smoke and fire
should do the trick fairly quickly or not at all, I would think.) I am more in favor of
Re’s equivalence with mohita- ‘bewildered’, a negative mental state. In my view,
‘besmoked’ means either that their minds have been darkened and led astray to evil
ways or that they have become confused / befuddled by our constant threats and
attacks and it is time for us to administer the coup de grâce.</p>

<p>On the ring between 1c #áhar-ahar and 11d divé-dive#, see publ. intro.
What I failed to note there (as IH pointed out to me) is that the áhar-ahar of vs. 1
was “repaired” by divé-dive in 2d, and the divé-dive here is responsive to both of
them.
II.31 All Gods
Ge (/WG) follows Windisch (Fs. Roth) in seeing this hymn as an allegory,
with rátha- ‘chariot’ = stóma- ‘praise’ and the solution provided only in the last vs. I
find this interpr. overblown. The equation of the hymn / sacrifice with a chariot is a
trite trope in the RV; I don’t see that this hymn treats the theme in a special way, but
perhaps I’m missing something.</p>
<h3 id="311-1">31.1</h3>
<p>As pointed out in the publ. intro., the last word of the vs., vanarṣád- ‘sitting
in/on the wood(s)’, applies both to the simile &ndash; the birds sitting in the trees &ndash; and the
frame &ndash; the charioteers sitting on the wooden chariot. The same qualifier could also
characterize other aspects of the sacrifice &ndash; the ritual fires sitting on the firewood,
the soma drinks in the wooden cups (for both of which see X.46.7). It is more
difficult to apply it to the priests, who are presumably the underlying referents of the
plural subject here.</p>
<h3 id="315">31.5</h3>
<p>The root noun cmpd apījū́- is somewhat puzzling, in that the 1st member api-
(apī- with lengthening at cmpd seam; for possible explan. see Scar 169 nn. 223, 224)
seems to contribute nothing. In fact, the standard tr. simply ignore it. Scar is on the
right track, I think, in taking it as only loosely compounded and meaning something
like “also speeders,” perhaps in order to preserve some cmpd sense “speeders in
addition.”
On návyasā vácaḥ see comm. ad VIII.39.2.
Pāda d in itself and in its syntactic relation to c is also problematic. Perhaps
the first, and possibly the easiest, issue is the apparently untethered ca. Klein (DGRV
I.226–27) takes it as conjoining the two pādas c and d, but this requires supplying a
verb (kṛṇve, flg. Ge) that has no support. I think rather that it signals a standard
42
syntagm that has been split across the vs.: “the still and the moving” (gen. sthātúr
jágataś ca VII.60.2, X.63.8, plus other examples with ca-less phrases and lexical
substitutions) is a common merism for “everything earthly.” In this verse pl. jágatām
is found in b, where Night and Dawn are the speeders of moving things; here its
formulaic partner, the still (in the sg.), is about to receive an underlayer of vigor. The
ca simply reminds us that b and d are implicitly contrasted: moving things are
impelled to even more movement, whereas still things are about to acquire a solid
base. To draw attention to the pairing it might be worthwhile to begin the tr. of d
with “and as for the still (world) …”
Another of the questions is the grammatical identity of trívayāḥ: is this
bahuvrīhi s-stem a nom. sg. masc., as it appears to be, or a nom./acc. neut.,
modifying váyaḥ? Although the latter interpr. might seem ungrammatical,
Wackernagel (AiG III.288) tentatively allows neut. -s-stem nom./acc. in -āḥ, though
the number of exx. he cites is small and it is possible that they could all be explained
in other ways. Nonetheless, in VII.24.2 (see comm. ad loc.) I do take dvibárhā(ḥ) as a
neut.; in IV.11.3 and X.80.4 vīrápeśā(ḥ) must have a neut. sg. reading; and a neut.
interpr. is the standard one for trívayāḥ here (e.g., Re “la vigueur tri-vigorante”). By
contrast I take it in the publ. tr. as a nom. sg. masc., modifying the 1st sg. subject of
stuṣé, hence “I possessing triple vigor …” I still think this is quite possible, but I do
not consider the alternative (“… to strew triple vigorous vigor as the underlayer …”)
out of the question.
The last question is who is doing the strewing. In my publ. tr. it is “I,” and
again I still consider this possible. But I think it’s also possible that I praise Heaven
and Earth so that they will provide the underlayer. This is esp. likely if trívayāḥ is
taken as neut.: “I praise you two … (for you) to strew triple-vigorous vigor …” The
pair, or at least Earth, makes sense as the cosmic entity that would provide a base for
the still, whereas Night and Dawn, in constant motion, make sense as the speeders of
the moving things.</p>
<h3 id="316">31.6</h3>
<p>The first hemistich begins and ends with utá. The pāda-final utá of 6b puts a
cap on the series of verse-initial utá’s that began in 3a (3a, 4a, 5a, 6a). This is
perhaps fitting because vs. 6 ends the capacious list of gods of every sort (from
mighty Indra to shadowy Aja Ekapad) who have been strung together additively.
The vs., or rather pādas a and d, plays on ś: śáṃsam uśijām … śmasi /
āśuhémā … śámi. This may be in part to showcase the unusual truncated verb śmasi
ending pāda a; note that verse-final śámi is a virtual anagram of this verb. This śámi
is also echoed by hemistich-final sám in 7b (in an unusual position). There are also
echoes from earlier in the hymn: āśu- picks up āśávaḥ (2a) as ékapād does pádyābhiḥ
(likewise 2a). IH cleverly points out that the position of śmasi after (i)va ([i]va śmasi)
hints at the root √vaś. See vaśmi in the next vs.
The Uśij-priests are credited with the production of a particular śáṃsaelsewhere, the āyóḥ śáṃsa- (IV.6.11, V.3.4). For further see comm. ad II.32.2.
43</p>
<h3 id="317">31.7</h3>
<p>The 1st sg. vaśmi may be seen as a type of poetic repair, anchoring the
truncated (u)śmasi of 6a.
II.32 Various Gods</p>
<h3 id="321">32.1</h3>
<p>The first hemistich here, with the skeleton asyá me dyāvāpṛthivī … bhūtám
avitrī́vácasaḥ … “become helpers of this speech of mine, o Heaven and Earth” is
somewhat reminiscent of the famous refrain in I.105 vittám me asyá rodasī “take
heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world halves,” though with aid rather than
mere attention asked of Heaven and Earth. The different ordering of the two
genitives asyá and me in the two passagestd conforms to our expectations of the
positioning of enclitics.
The syntax of the second hemistich is rather stiff and clotted, with an oblique
nominal relative clause (“of which two there is extensive lifetime”) picked up by a
long main clause beginning in the middle of pāda c with the 3rd ps. du. prn. té. It is
only after some time that we discover that té is an accusative, the object of versefinal dadhe, and that it is doubled by du. enclitic vām, which switches the reference
to 2nd ps. The enclitic vām is very oddly placed, smack in the middle of pāda d, not
leaning on any of its adjacent elements semantically, as far as I can see. Moreover,
puráḥ … dadhe seems to be a phrasal verb, but with the two parts of the phrase
distant from each other and separated by extraneous material.</p>
<h3 id="322">32.2</h3>
<p>The first pāda of this vs. is esp. puzzling. As usual in the RV, Āyu sows
confusion, and here, since it is not clear who/what Āyu represents, it is also unclear
with what to construe the gen. āyóḥ. The standard interpr. take it with rípaḥ
‘swindles, tricks’, while I attach it to áhan ‘day’ (with no confidence in its
correctness; Old explicitly rejects it). The problem is that Āyu is generally viewed
positively, as in II.2.8 where the ritual fire is “the guest dear to Āyu” and II.4.2
where the Bhṛgus deposit the ritual fire “among the clans of Āyu.” If Āyu is positive
in value, then the “swindles of Āyu” must be those directed against him, as Old
points out. But as he also points out, the more natural reading of this gen. would be
subjective (“swindles perpetrated by Āyu”), not objective. It must be admitted that
once in this maṇḍala (II.14.7), Āyu is viewed negatively: Indra strikes down the
heros of Āyu along with those of Kutsa and Atithigva, a trio that is subject to Indra’s
violence elsewhere, though also individually named as Indra’s comrades in still other
passages. More to the point, in my opinion, is the apparent formula VERB uśíjaḥ
śáṃsam āyóḥ “The Uśij-priests X-ED the Laud of Āyu” (IV.6.11, V.3.4). In the
immediately preceding hymn, II.31, we find in 6a the expression śáṃsam uśíjām “the
Laud of the Uśij-priests,” and in the next vs., 7b, the Āyu-s (pl.) figure as fashioners
of ritual speech. This suggestive juxtaposition and echo of the fuller expression
“Laud of Āyu” found in the preceding closely related hymn suggest that Āyu here is
viewed positively and is related to the ritual; I therefore think that “the day of Āyu”
is a way of referring to the day of the sacrifice.
44
Most forms belonging to the thematic stem dábha- must be root aor.
subjunctives, but here the mā́requires an injunctive. Formally the root aor. injunctive
should have a zero-grade root, *dbhan, but obviously such a form is not viable. With
full-grade restored, the injunctive is identical to the subjunctive. On these forms see
Hoffman (Injunk. 242–43), who suggests that a new injunc. dabhur was created to
avoid this functional coincidence.
sakhyā́occurs several times with ví √yu ‘keep away’. Narten (Sig. Aor. 214)
states that the s-aor. to this root is intrans., and Ge (/WG) render it thus here: “Nicht
soll sich unserer Freundschaft lösen,” presumably with neut. pl. sakhyā́as subj. of
the sg. verb. However, VIII.86.1 mā́no ví yauṣṭam sakhyā́, with dual verb seems to
me decisive for a transitive interpr. of this idiom. In the publ. tr. (“Do not keep us far
away from your companionship”) I take sakhyā́as an instr. (sg.) of separation.
However, it is also possible that it is an acc. pl., with the tr. “Do not keep your
companionship(s) far away from us.” See IV.16.20.
The phrase viddhí tásya naḥ (“know this (speech?) of ours” in the publ. tr)
resonates with I.105 vittám me asyá “take heed of this (speech?) of mine, which I
adduced above in regard to asyá me … opening our 1a. It might better have been tr.
with “take heed.”</p>

<p>The priests’ sumnāyatā́mánasā “with a mind seeking favor” is, hopefully,
matched by the god’s áheḷatā mánasā “with a mind without anger.”
As in the previous hymn, II.31.2, pádyābhiḥ is directly adjacent to a form of
āsú- ‘swift’. Ge (/WG) take pádyā- as ‘heels’: “(Wie) en siegesstarkes Rennpferd mit
den Fersen.” The image assumed must be from horseback riding, with the rider
spurring the horse on by putting pressure on the horse’s flank with his heels. But the
evidence for horseback riding in the RV is scant, and, as I understand it, the racing
that is done involves chariots. (On the other hand, there may be mention of “a hero
on horseback” [vīró árvati] in the next hymn, II.33.1, though it probably refers to
Rudra.) Not only does this heel-spurring not fit the realia, as far as we know it, but it
makes trouble for the verbal structure, because “with the heels” would at best only be
appropriate to the simile (“(like) a swift prize-winner”) not the frame (“you”: we are
hardly likely to be poking the god in the side with our heels). And finally, although
the heel is of course a part of the foot and so pádya-/pádyā- could in theory refer to
it, no other occurrences of either of these stems seems so specialized, and we do have
a perfectly good inherited word for ‘heel’, pā́rṣṇi-. I therefore think pádyā- means
‘pace, footstep’. In the simile, “with paces” would refer either to the training the
horse is put through or to the pace of another horse running in front or at its side
meant to keep the vājín- up to speed. Its use in the frame is more complex. On the
one hand, the steps can refer to the movements of the Adhvaryu around the ritual
ground; his physical activity is implicitly contrasted with the verbal activity (vácasā)
of the Hotar (and Udgātar). I also think that pádyā- can refer to verses measured in
feet, metrical measures. Although Re thinks this unlikely (“tentant, mais trop hardi”),
I see nothing against it.

<h3 id="324">32.4</h3>
<p>The adj. śatádāya- has a more precise meaning than the standard tr. (e.g., Ge
“vollwertigen”) and one different from that in the publ. tr. (“having a hundred
shares,” flg. Gr). It was long ago established by Roth (ZDMG 41: 672–76) that this
has to do with Wergeld or the worth of a man as measured in cows, hence here ‘(for
whom) a hundred (cows) are to be given’; cf. Ge’s n. 4d, Macdonell-Keith Vedic
Index s.v. vaira, and V.61.8 with comm. ad loc. I would therefore emend the tr. to “a
hero worth a hundred (cows) …”</p>

<p>Rudra
This is a much anthologized hymn, fully translated by Macdonell in VRS,
Doniger, and Maurer. Its popularity is not surprising: it’s lively and varied, but does
not pose major difficulties, though it has its share of small knots.
Re EVP XV.157–60.</p>
<h3 id="331">33.1</h3>
<p>The only difficult pāda is c, which has received a variety of interpr. The first
question is whether vīró árvati should be construed together or árvati taken with
some other part of the clause. With Ge (/WG) I take the two words together in the
publ. tr.; most other tr. (Macdonell, Re, Doniger, Maurer) take it with naḥ or directly
with the verb abhí … kṣameta. Ge (/WG) take the hero to be one of us, a human; this
leads Ge to interpr. the verb as passive (“Es möge unser Kriegsmann zu Ross
verschont blieben”), although all forms of this idiom, med. abhí √kṣam, all of which
appear in this little group of hymns (II.28.3, 29.2, 33.1, 33.7), have the same
meaning, “be indulgent/patient towards” (see esp. vs. 7). With most tr. I instead
understand vīrá- to be Rudra; it is appropriate to ask for his indulgence or patience.
This leads us to the question of whether Rudra is likely to be on horseback. I know of
no evidence for or against, but given that Rudra is the Maruts’ father and they are
often associated with horses, it is certainly possible. However, the only other
occurrence of árvati in the RV (VIII.71.12) appears to be an unmarked loc. absolute:
we ask Agni for help “when a charger (is at stake).” It is therefore possible that the
same usage is found here, and the pāda should mean “The hero should be indulgent
to us when a charger (is at stake).” I leave the question open.</p>
<h3 id="333">33.3</h3>
<p>This is the only occurrence of sg. vájra-bāhu- that doesn’t qualify Indra.
(The only non-sg. form is dual vajra-bāhū addressed to Indra and Agni in I.109.7.) I
do not know why Rudra is thus identified here.</p>
<h3 id="334">33.4</h3>
<p>The sáhūti-, a joint invocation (with another god or gods), may be a sore
subject for Rudra. As pointed out in the publ. intro., he receives only three hymns
dedicated to him alone in the RV; otherwise two hymns joint with Soma and
incidental mentions in hymns to other gods. He may feel slighted. See also disc. ad
VI.49.10.</p>
<h3 id="335">33.5</h3>
<p>I am in agreement with most tr. (though not Macd.) that pāda b is the thought
of the subject of the rel. cl. in pāda a, namely the over-zealous sacrificer. The verb
46
áva … diṣīya belongs not with √dā ‘give’ (with Gr), but √dā ‘cut, divide’ (so already
Wh Roots); see esp. Narten (Sig Aor. 138–40). The idiom áva √dā is generally
taken, including by Narten, to mean ‘abfinden’ (propitiate, compensate), but I think it
has a more literal meaning here, ‘cut off’. The too-little ritual service of vs. 4 &ndash; poor
praise (dúṣṭuti-) and shared invocation (sáhūti-) &ndash; meets the contrasting fault in vs.
5: the over-eager worshiper who wants Rudra as his own exclusively. This is a
dramatic opposite of the sáhūti-; not only an invocation directed only to this god, but
one not jointly produced by the group of priests and worshippers. Such a private oneon-one human-divine relationship would be quite anomalous in the RVic religious
world, where divine service requires cooperation among various ritual personnel.
The personal appeals in the Vasiṣṭha-Varuṇa hymns of VII have such a strong impact
in part because they deviate so far from ordinary religious practice.
The standard interpr. of the second hemistich makes the main clause rather
loosely attached to the rel. cl. of pāda a. The “us” (naḥ) of c is supposed to pick up
the yáḥ of a and the manā́- of d is supposed to refer rather vaguely to the sentiment
expressed in ab: in other words, we don’t want to be the sort of person who might
think such a thing or be suspected of thinking such a thing. I think the connection is
much simpler. manā́- is generally ‘zeal’ or ‘enthusiasm’; it is not inherently a
negative notion, but becomes negative in the wrong hands (or mind). In my interpr.,
the “whoever” of the rel. cl. in a is our sacrificial rival, who is trying to cut us out of
the deal, as it were, by getting Rudra to himself. We beg Rudra not to make us
subject to, subordinate to, his over-zealous action.
The epithet ṛdūdára- ‘tender-hearted’ is a charming phonetic play on Rudra’s
name, which is almost always read trisyllabically (rudara) in this hymn.
Another adj. (see 3b above) otherwise used (almost) exclusively of Indra:
suśípra- ‘well-lipped’ (of Agni V.22.4; in pl. of Ṛbhukṣans VII.37.1).</p>
<h3 id="336">33.6</h3>
<p>On ghṛ́ṇī see Old.
I take ‘favor’ (sumnám) as the gapped goal of the verb in c, aśīya ‘might I
reach’.</p>
<h3 id="337">33.7</h3>
<p>In b the yó ásti … clause might appear to be embedded in the main clause, if
c resumes the question posed in a. However, c could simply be part of the rel. cl.
Even if b is embedded, it is unproblematic, since nominal rel. clauses are an
exception to the no-embedding rule, functioning rather like izafe-s.
In d abhī́… cakṣamīthāḥ reprises 1c abhí … kṣameta. Given that final
lengthening in the preverb abhí is extremely rare (Lub: 739 abhí, 14 abhī́.), I am
inclined to interpr. the form as abhí ī, with the enclitic acc. anticipating the obj. mā,
esp. given that in vs. 1 in this same idiom abhí appears without length.</p>
<h3 id="338">33.8</h3>
<p>The verb in c, namasyā́, can be either 2nd sg. impv. or 1st sg. subj., and
translations differ. Because of the surrounding 1st ps. verbs (b: 1st sg. īrayāmi, d: 1st
pl. gṛṇīmási) I opt for the 1st sg. subjunctive, though there are no implications either
way.
47
kalmalīkín- is obviously a possessive -ín-stem built to a -ka-suffixed form of
kalmalí-, found once in the AV (XV.2.1–4) in unclear meaning, as descriptor of a
jewel. The l’s and the reduplicative rhyming formation (kal-mal-) mark it as nonstandard and suggest that it is affective in some fashion. My tr. “sparkling one” is
similar to those of others, but given the uncertainty of the word and its base, it should
have been marked with a question mark.</p>
<h3 id="339">33.9</h3>
<p>The tr. should be slight adjusted to “this … world,” to reflect the adjectival
demonst. asyá.</p>
<h3 id="3310">33.10</h3>
<p>Given that the two words for ‘bow’, dhánus- and dhánvan-, are suppletive
in the RV with the former supplying the nom./acc. sg. and the latter the rest of the
paradigm (see disc. ad VI.75.2), my tr. of dhánvā̆(and indeed the various tr. of Re,
Macd, Doniger, and Maurer; Ge’s “trägst du Pfeile und Bogen” is ambiguous,
because Bogen is both sg. and pl.) as singular must be wrong, and Gr’s identification
of the form as pl. is correct. In fact, though the Pp reads dhánva with short final, in
the Saṃhitā text the word spans the pāda boundary and coalesces with the following
word as dhánvā́rhann and so could be underlyingly dhánvā, with an unambig. pl.
ending. In any case I would alter the publ. tr. to “arrows and bows.”
The VP in c, idáṃ dayase víśvam ábhvam, is variously rendered: Ge “verfügst
du über all diese Gewalt,” Macd “wieldest all this force” (sim. Doniger, Maurer)
versus Re “tu détruis tout mal-informe,” WG “… zerstörst du all dieses Unwesen.” I
do not think either of these approaches is correct. On the one hand, ábhva- does not
mean ‘power’, but rather ‘formless(ness)’, often conceived as monstrous (Re’s ‘malinforme’ [badly shapeless], though odd, seems close). Nor does dayate, if belonging
to √dā ‘cut, divide, distribute’ as Ge et al. seem to take it, mean ‘wield, have
control’. As for the other view, Re simply states that dáyate can mean ‘destroy’,
while WG explicitly adopt Gotō’s view (1st class pres., 172–74) that there are two
distinct roots √dā that have dáyate as pres., one ‘divide, distribute’, the other
‘destroy’. None of the passages adduced by Gotō for ‘destroy’ requires segregation
in a separate root that has little else to support its existence; they can all be seen as
metaphorical extensions of ‘divide, cut apart’ (3 of the 5 passages occur with ví), an
extension well within the bounds of RVic poetic imagination (though perhaps not of
all its commentators). My own view is that the action attributed to Rudra here is a
cosmogonic one, regularly performed by other Rigvedic gods, namely the division of
the formless chaos of the pre-creation universe into what will later be referred to by
the expression “name-and-form” (nāma-rūpa-) As I have discussed in numerous
other places (see, e.g., my forthcoming “The Blob in Ancient India”), the Vedic
conception of creation involves division into separate entities, with clear boundaries
and names, of an originally fuzzy boundary-less mass, which strikes horror in the
hearts of Vedic people. In my view, the verb dayate here has its standard root
meaning, ‘cut, divide, apportion’, and Rudra is engaged in cosmogonic division. In
this sense the verb often occurs with the preverb ví, which sometimes occurs directly
after the verb occupying post-caesura position (e.g. … dáyase ví … VI.37.4,
48
VII.23.4). Although the preverb is not found here, víśvam immediately follows the
verb and evokes the preverb. Note a different use of the same root in vs. 5; also note
that nā́ma is found in 8d and -rūpa- in 9a, evoking the notion “name and form.”
In my publ tr. I did not fully render the idám, however. I would substitute
“this whole formless void” or perhaps “the whole formless void here.”</p>
<h3 id="3312">33.12</h3>
<p>Although most tr. (Ge, Re, Doniger, Maurer, but not Macd) take nānāma as
1st sg., with nom. kumāráḥ relegated to a simile, I follow Kü (278)(and Macd., see
also Gr) in taking nānāma as 3rd sg. For one thing, cid isn’t a simile particle (pace
Ge), and so this would have to be an unmarked simile (not, of course, impossible),
and for another we might expect (or at least hope for) *nānama with short root vowel
as a 1st sg. pf. The point of the half-vs. must be that even a little boy knows to honor
someone more powerful and distinguished than he is, and so I surely know to do the
same.</p>

<p>The śáṃ(tama)- here makes a ring with śáṃtama- in 2a.

<h3 id="3314">33.14</h3>
<p>As IH pointed out to me, gāt in b should have a modal reading, either as an
injunc. matching the precative value of the preceding verb vṛjyāḥ or expressing the
imperatival value often found in root aor. injunctives; hence either “should go around
us” or “let it go around us.”
The mid. impv. (áva …) tanuṣva suggests that it is Rudra’s own bows that
should be un-strung. Recall that he bore the bow in 10a (bibharṣi … dhánva).</p>
<h3 id="3315">33.15</h3>
<p>In the publ. tr., the yáthā cl. is rendered as a purpose cl. (“… that you do not
become angry …”), but yáthā purpose cls. always take the subjunctive, as Macd.
already pointed out. It should rather be construed with the vs.-initial evā́, in the usual
“just as …, so …” relationship, though with the usual order reversed. Macd. also
recognized this, but suggested that evā́is “to be taken with c, since in the normal
syntactical order if should follow yáthā in the sense which it has here.” This is a
trickier piece of syntax than I think can be justified — hopscotching the evā́over the
whole yáthā clause — and the contents of c do not conform to the standard usage of
summary evā́. Instead I think evā́sums up the successful achievement of the wishes
expressed in the preceding vs. (and perhaps in the whole preceding hymn): “even as
you are not angry and do not smite, so (it is): the missile has avoided us, the bows are
unstrung, etc.” This is somewhat hard to render in Engl., but I would change the
publ. tr. to “Just as you are not angry and do not smite, so (it has come to pass).”</p>

<p>Maruts
A very difficult hymn, whose problems were perhaps not sufficiently
signalled in the publ. intro.
49</p>
<h3 id="341">34.1</h3>
<p>Old rejects the cmpd interpr of dhārāvará- and takes -vará- as a suffix
meaning ‘reich an’; Ge (/WG, the latter explicitly) follow his interpr. But as Re pts.
out there is no such secondary suffix in the RV &ndash; pace Debrunner (AiG II.2.908),
who lists this as the earliest example of the -vara- / -vala- suffix in the sense of -
vant-. It is also Deb’s only r-form; the remaining examples listed have -vala-.
(Curiously, early in II.2 [p. 98] he glosses dhārā-vará- as ‘Regengüsse liebend’, with
the cmpd interpr., so he doesn&rsquo;t seem to have paid full attention to this hapax.) One of
Old’s objections to the cmpd interpr. is that the accent rules out a bahuvrīhi, but I see
no reason why it can’t be a tatpuruṣa with vará- ‘wooer’ as 2nd member.
It is notable that “unclosing the cows” (ápa gā́avṛṇata), the standard
culmination of the Vala myth, is here attributed to the Maruts, who ordinarily do not
participate in that myth. Of course here “cows” could stand for rain clouds; see the
flaming cows in vs. 5.
II.34.2–5: Note the concentration of pṛSIB forms: 2d pṛ́śni
yāḥ, 3d prk̥ ṣám …
pṛ́ṣatībhiḥ, 4a prk̥ ṣé, 4c pṛ́ṣadaśva (and scrambled -śiprā in 3c, rapśa- in 5a).</p>
<h3 id="342">34.2</h3>
<p>In pāda a the -ín-stem khādín- in the frame corresponds functionally to the
instr. stṛ́bhiḥ in the simile. See 4d below.
The 2nd hemistich presents a severe mismatch between semantic/contextual
expectations and morphosyntax. As we know, Rudra is the father of the Maruts. This
vs. contains a nom. sg. rudráḥ and enclitic 2nd pl. vaḥ referring to the Maruts, which
can be acc., dat., or gen., and a form of the verb √jan ‘beget’. All the standard tr.
render the expression “Rudra begot you, o Maruts” (vel sim.). The problem is that
the verb is ájani, a form of the so-called passive aor. Re breezily remarks “seul cas
de valeur transitive.” But not only are the other occurrences of this form
intrans./pass., but it belongs to a formation (the “passive aorist”) that is strongly
typed for this function. Moreover, the medial -iṣ-aor. forms loosely associated with
this form (ájaniṣṭa, etc.) are overwhelmingly intrans./pass. It is inconceivable to me
that a Vedic audience would attribute or accept transitive value for ájani here, given
the robust grammatical support for intrans./passive value.
I therefore think we must interpr. it acdg. to its formal shape, rather than
imposing a transitive sense to make the passage easier (or easier by our lights). My
way of doing so also requires us to read the sandhi form śukrá as nom. sg. śukráḥ,
rather than the Pp.’s loc. śukré. In this interpr. nom. sg. vṛ́ṣā … śukráḥ is a secondary
predicate of rudráḥ: “R. was born as bullish semen in the udder of Pṛśni.” It is this
semen that combines with Pṛśni to produce the Maruts; it can also, in naturalistic
terms, be the rain in the thunderclouds that are Pṛśni’s udder. This gender mingling
and loss of distinction between the Maruts’ bull-father (=Rudra) and their mother
Pṛśni in the udder are also found, in somewhat different fashion, in IV.3.10d vṛ́ṣā
śukráṃ duduhe pṛ́ṣnir ū́dhaḥ “the bull as Pr̥śni milked gleaming (milk/semen) from
his (/her) udder” and in VI.66.1d sakṛ́c chukráṃ duduhe pṛ́ṣnir ū́dhaḥ “only once did
Prś̥ ni milk the gleaming (milk/semen) from the udder.” See also VI.48.22 and comm.
50
ad loc., which may also refer to the birth of Rudra/his semen as occurring before the
birth(s) of the Maruts.
It is somewhat remarkable that both Griffith and Max Müller (SBE) also take
ájani seriously (“Rudra .. sprang into life for you in P&rsquo;s radiant lap” and “as soon as
R. … was born for you &hellip; in the bright lap of P.,” respectively; see also von Bradke,
Fs. Roth, p. 118). Perhaps the commentators who came later wished to distance
themselves from these not-always-reliable role models even when they appear to be
right.</p>
<h3 id="343">34.3</h3>
<p>My rendering of nadásya kárṇaiḥ “with the ‘ears’ of the reed(-whip)”
follows Pischel’s sugg. (Ved. Stud. I.191; see Ge’s n. 3bc and Old) that nadá- is here
‘reed’ (cf. I.32.8) (beside naḍá- ‘id.’) rather than ‘roarer’ and that it refers to a whip
or riding crop of some sort. I suggest that the “ears” would be some part of the whip,
perhaps knots on the whiplashes or the like. Pischel’s idea has been generally
rejected (though Oberlies [Relig. II.247] seems to accept it); see esp. Old’s negative
remarks. But the alternative notion, that the Maruts are directing their horses by the
ears of a(nother? side?) horse makes no sense to me: how would such direction
work? And although Old explicitly states that the number is not an issue, referring to
plural (not dual) ears of a single horse (or even several horses, since pairs of body
parts generally are referred to in the dual even when several individuals are in
question) seems problematic to me.
In my interpr. the two instr. pls. kárṇaiḥ and āśúbhiḥ are separate. So also
Old, Re, though they otherwise accept the lead-ear theory. But Ge (/WG) construe
them together (“with swift ears”), which in my view makes a puzzling interpr. even
more so.
The next question is how to interpr. the intensive part. dávidhvataḥ. Though
the stem is usually transitive, Ge (/WG) take it absolutely (“schüttelnd”), while Re
supplies an obj. seemingly at random (“qui secouez-puissamment (le monde)”). I
extract ‘lips’ (śípra-) from the cmpd. híraṇyaśipra-, since du. śípre serves as object
to just this participle in X.96.9.
The pṛkṣám of d should not be severed from pṛkṣé beginning 4a, though at
least in Ge’s (/WG’s) tr. the connection is not signalled (Re’s rendering does connect
them). In general thematic pṛkṣá- refers to a strengthening substance, esp.
nourishment. The corresponding root noun pṛ́kṣ- has the same basic sense (see
Schindler, Rt Noun, s.v.), but here in the dat. is used infinitively (so also Schindler,
as well as the standard tr.). The phrase pṛkṣáṃ yātha may well be a syntagm, judging
from the PN pṛkṣá-yāma in I.122.7 (adduced by Old), and the acc. appears to be a
goal, contra Ge’s (/WG) rendering of pṛkṣám as an adverb (“kräftig”).</p>
<h3 id="344">34.4</h3>
<p>The two alternatives marked by vā ‘or’ (“to fortify all creatures or for
alliance”) seem to have little to do with each other. Perhaps we are meant to assume
“for alliance with all creatures” for the second alternative, hence my “(with them).”
As in 2a an element found in a free syntagm in the simile has its
correspondent in a compound: loc. vayúneṣu matches dhūr- and both are governed by
51
the cmpd 2nd member -sád-, at least in my interpr. (guided by Th., Unters., 23); the
other standard tr. do not take vayúneṣu with the simile.
The meaning and etym. of the word vayúna- are much disputed; see EWA
s.v., which lemma consists only of a list of secondary lit. I follow Th’s interpr.
(Unters.) to some degree, but consider it more likely a derivative of the (secondary)
root √vā ‘weave’ than of √vyā ‘envelop’ and the more likely meaning ‘pattern,
tracery’ than ‘Umhüllung’. This literal meaning (arising from the repetitive patterns
found in woven material) can then be applied, on the one hand, to similar visual
effects (e.g., light and shadow produced by sunlight filtering through trees and
bushes) or metaphorically to phenomena that show similarly repetitive patterns, such
as ritual procedures. In this particular passage both senses may be at play. In the
simile (in my view) the birds are sitting on “the traceries (of the branches)”: the
pattern of light and shade I just alluded to is turned on its head, to refer to the
branches that produce those light patterns. But it is also possible to construe it with
the frame, where the Maruts sitting at the chariot pole (often a metaphor evoking the
chariot of sacrifice; see, e.g., the same cmpd dhūrṣád- applied to Agni at the sacrifice
in the 2nd hymn in this maṇḍala [II.2.1]) could also be sitting among the ritual
patterns of the ongoing ceremony. I continue to maintain, however, that vayúneṣu
here belongs primarily to the simile. I also suggest that vayúneṣu subtly evokes the
word(s) we might expect in this simile. Birds usually sit in trees, and váneṣu √sad is
fairly common; compare esp. vanarṣád- (with a bird simile) in nearby II.31.1 (and
X.132.7 dhūrṣádaṃ vanarṣádam with the same pole-sitting as here). There is also the
word vayā́- ‘twig’, which might be another place birds would be expected to sit
(though it does not occur in the loc., unfortunately). A form of this rarer word is
found in the next hymn (II.35.8). I therefore wonder if vayúna- here is felt as a nonce
blend of vána- and vayā́-, in addition to having its own regular sense.</p>
<h3 id="345">34.5</h3>
<p>Despite the almost comic image of the flaming cows, the reference in this
half-verse is fairly clear. The cows with their teeming udders must be the
thunderclouds; their ‘enflaming’ quality is presumably the lightning. Although the
formation of the hapax índhanvan- is morphologically peculiar, it can hardly belong
with anything but the nasal-infix present to √idh ‘kindle’, unless it is corrupt (as Old
suggests).
The simile “like geese to good pastures” may initially seem unusual &ndash; we
expect cows to come to good pastures (see 8c below), not geese. But anyone familiar
with Canada geese frequently sees flocks of them in pastures and post-harvest grain
fields, and a Google search of “Canada geese in pastures” turns up numerous
complaints about their regular mess-producing presence therein, as well as numerous
pictures; similar pictures of (Indian) bar headed geese feeding in fields also turn up
in a Google search. The image is appropriate to the Maruts, who would fly down in a
flock to settle on the ritual ground just as flocks of geese do in fields.
Note the alliterative pāda d: mádhor mádāya marutaḥ samanyavaḥ.

<h3 id="346">34.6</h3>
<p>The free syntagm narā́ṃ (ná) śáṃsa- with gen. pl. narā́m is found also in
I.173.9–10 and, in reversed order, in VI.24.2 śáṃso narā́m. It is obviously a variant
of the doubly accented cmpd nárā-śáṃsa-, which also occurs in tmesis without
conversion of the 1st member to gen. pl. in nárā (ca/vā) śáṃsa- (IV.86.42 and X.64.3
respectively). It is possible that the final -m of narā́ṃ was generated by the initial
nasal of ná and the accent adjusted to produce a case form from an underlying *nárā
ná śáṃsa- in the three occurrences of this syntagm that have this order; the meter
would be unaffected. However, the example with the opposite order makes this less
likely. In any case, this scarcely matters; the problem is to figure out the referent of
the phrase here, whose head is nom. sg. and therefore must be compared to the subj.
of the impv. gantana, namely the Maruts. Narāśaṃsa is a shadowy divine figure or
divine epithet (cf. Re, EVP X.76 n. 7: “la Récitation personifiée?”), who has a
regular role in Āprī hymns (generally in the 3rd vs.) and is sometimes identified with
Agni and less frequently with other gods (see, e.g., Macdonell, Ved. Myth., p. 100).
So our vs. may be comparing the Maruts to a divine figure who should be at the
sacrifice &ndash; quite possibly Agni. (This interpr. is explicitly rejected by Re. in favor of
a common noun “la récitation faite par les officiants,” EVP X.76 n. 7.) Or, in keeping
with Re’s view, it may refer to a ritual element, the laud, that should be present at the
sacrifice. Alternatively, and in keeping with my interpr. of the expression in VI.24.2
(see comm. there) and the phrase śáṃsam ā́yóḥ (IV.6.11, V.3.4), it may refer to the
gods as being like the embodiment of the praise they receive, in an idiom like
English “the toast of the town.” Under this interpr. I would alter the tr. to “like the
Laud of Men.” In any case, by most interpr. of the cmpd (and associated syntagms)
the ‘men’ (narā́m) are in subject-relation to śáṃsa-: that is, they are producing the
laud, not receiving it.
The 2nd pl. act. impv. pipyata belongs to the perfect stem, but shows pseudoathematic inflection (expect *pipita). On such forms see my 2018 “The Vedic Perfect
Imperative and the Status of Modal Forms to Tense-Aspect Stems” (Fs. Lubotsky);
briefly, the act. pseudo-thematic impvs. begin, I think, in the dual act. imperatives
(here 2nd du. pipyatam 4x, 3rd du. pipyatām 1x), which owe their disyllabic desinence
to the indic. dual endings -athus, -atus. Subsequently the -a- liaison had a limited
spread, here to the phonologically similar 2nd pl.
The phrase dhíyam … vā́japeśasam “visionary thought that has prizes as its
ornament” is a shorthand way to refer to the standard ritual tit-for-tat, with the gods
giving material goods in exchange for praise. But it also probably incorporates
another element of that exchange, that the gods themselves inspire or create in the
poet the poetic vision that he then shapes into praise of them.</p>
<h3 id="348">34.8</h3>
<p>The function of the presumed loc. bháge (bhága in sandhi) is unclear. Ge
(/WG) construe it with sudā́navaḥ (“die im Glück freigebigen”), but this common
epithet never elsewhere participates in a syntagm. Re takes it as an expression of
purpose, and my tr. also reflects such a function, though the loc. doesn’t ordinarily
express purpose. I wonder if this is not a (deliberately) mangled dative. Our
supposed loc. (the only loc. to this stem in the RV) is immediately followed by ā́
53
(bhága ā́), which resembles the dat. bhágāya with quantity flip. If this seems too
radical, we can simply take it as loc. + ā́and interpr. it as “in (a state of) good
fortune” vel sim.
The simile in c can be viewed as poetic repair for the one in 5c discussed
above: “like geese to good pastures” there seemed a bit off (though in fact perfectly
compatible with observed realia); here the milk-cow in good pastures provides the
expected pairing of cow and fodder.
However, the simile here is off in a different way; it is an example of case
disharmony (see my 1982, IIJ 24 article), with the cow (nom. dhénuḥ) in the simile
the subj. of an intrans./reflexive sense of pinvate, while in the frame the verb is
transitive, with íṣaṃ as obj. (The dat. of benefit stays constant in simile and frame.)
This is possible because of the complex semantics of ‘swell’ words in the RV, also
discussed in the just-cited article. It would be possible to avoid the case-disharmony
explanation, by supplying ‘udder’ as obj. in the simile (“as a milk-cow swells her
udder…”). Udders figure prominently in this hymn (see esp. 6c áśvām iva pipyata
dhenúm ū́dhani “make the mare, the milk-cow swell in her udder”). However, since
this simile is not only intelligible without supplying an object but conforms to case
disharmony patterns elsewhere, I see no reason to do so.
Not only is pinvate an ambiguous pivot in terms of syntactic valence, but its
very morphology is exploited for ambiguity as well, at least in my view. The
thematic Class I pres. pínvati is of course well established in the RV, but it is of
course also historically a thematicization of a Class V nó/nu pres. *pinóti / *pinuté, of
which a few relic forms are found (e.g., med. part. pinvāná-). The 3rd pl. mid. to this
pres. would be pinvaté (pinvate without accent), exactly the form we have here. So in
the simile pinvate matches its singular subj. dhénuḥ in number, but in the frame it can
also match its underlying plural subject, the Maruts, if it’s assigned to an athematic
stem.
Note that the caesura splits the bahuvrīhi rātáhaviṣe. Though such a split is
fairly common with dual dvandvas, it is considerably rarer with more tightly
constructed cmpds. (I can’t offhand come up with any other exx., though I haven’t
systematically looked.)</p>
<h3 id="349">34.9</h3>
<p>The cheating mortal of the rel. cl. has no surface representation in the (first)
main clause, the two-word finale of pāda b, but the full clause of c contains tám (in
unusual final position), which picks up the yáḥ of the rel. cl. The publ. tr. supplies a
reference in the b-clause in the phrase “from his harm,” and this is certainly possible.
It might be better, however, to treat “protect us from harm” as parenthetical as Ge
does (see his n. 9b), with the real main cl. found only in c.
Re is insistent on taking tápus- only as a noun, not as an adjective with the
standard interpr. (incl. Gr), but though he is technically correct that the root accent
should mark it as a noun (‘scorching heat’), it seems to have been reinterpr. as an
adj., possibly on the basis of its regular participation in tápus-X cmpds (tápurjambha-, etc.). Though these originally would have meant ‘whose X is searing heat’,
it would be easy to slip into ‘having scorching X’.
54</p>
<h3 id="3410">34.10</h3>
<p>The sense of this vs., or rather its second half, is very uncertain. See esp.
Old’s comments. In the first half, the course of the Maruts shows brightly. The
intens. 3rd sg. middle with -t-less ending, cékite, is taken by Schaeffer (Intens., 44,
112) as having the (/an) old stative ending, which she takes in passive sense (“wird
immer wieder erkannt”) in all occurrences of this form. The passive interpr. seems
unnecessary: numerous formations to √cit mean simply ‘appear (bright)’. In the
intens. it can mean ‘appear continuously bright’ or ‘appear ever more bright’, and
this sense works well for all 5 occurrences of cékite. As for the form, I doubt that we
need to reach into deep prehistory for a stative ending; rather it seems likely to me
that it is what we might call a “perfecto-intensive,” built alongside med. pf. cikité
with adjustment of the redupl. vowel.
A different manipulation of the perfect is probably to be seen in the verb of b,
duhúḥ (also twice elsewhere without accent), which appears to have been generated
to the -t-less middle root pres. 3rd pl. duhré (3rd sg. duhé) and has acquired the act. 3rd
pl. ending -úḥ because those middle forms look like unredupl. pf. forms.
It is not entirely clear who the “friends” are who milk Pṛśni’s udder. The
udder itself is presumably, as elsewhere (e.g., 5a above), the rain cloud; milking it
causes rain to fall. In nearby II.29.4 the friends (āpáyaḥ as here) are the gods, in
V.53.2 more narrowly the Maruts. Either would work here, though the 2nd ps. address
to the Maruts in pāda a and the 3rd ps. ref. of āpáyaḥ in b requires person shift if the
referent is the Maruts; nonetheless, Ge and Re opt for the Maruts. It is worth noting
that the word participates in a word play with the verb: (ā)páyo duhúḥ “milk milk,”
with the neut. s-stem páyas- ‘milk’ lurking there (cf. VI.48.22 pṛ́śnyā dugdháṃ sakṛ́t
páyaḥ, with páyaḥ √duh as well as Pṛśni). This pun may have invited the use of the
stem āpí-. I do not understand the purport of the immediately preceding particle ápi,
unless it is meant to resonate with āpáyo. ápi does not otherwise appear with √duh,
though Ge unearths an ex. in MS (where it appears to be contextually driven).
The rest of the verse is close to hopeless because, on the one hand, the role of
Trita (or “the third one”) cannot be pinned down and, on the other, the syntax is
slippery and there is no main verb. The standard tr. think Trita is assuming the role
of scapegoat and taking on scorn and old age, to spare us (or others), on the basis of
passages like VIII.47.13. But Trita has other functions in Vedic, including in vs. 14
of this very hymn, where he is responsible for delivering multiple Hotars, and a more
positive role for Trita than scapegoat therefore seems likely. He is also associated
with the Maruts in V.54.2 as one who bellows when the Maruts come together with
lightning (sáṃ vidyútā dádhati vā́śati tritáḥ); the presence of a roarer here
(návamānasya) is reminiscent of that passage. My tr. is provisional; for the main
verb I supply a form of √dhā on the basis of nearby II.23.14 yé tvā nidé dadhiré with
nidé as here. Although I supplied a 3rd pl. form, continuing the 3rd pl. of b, it could
easily be 2nd pl. (so the standard tr.) with Maruts as subject; the voc. phrase rudriyāḥ
… adābhyāḥ may support the 2nd pl. Otherwise I frankly admit that my tr. is not
based on a firm sense of what the passage is meant to convey. Note that scorn returns
in 15b.
55</p>
<h3 id="3412">34.12</h3>
<p>The relationship between the Daśagvas and the Maruts is not clear. Re
suggests that they are identical, but I find this unlikely. The Daśagvas are a rarely
mentioned collectivity, generally grouped together with their slightly more
prominent kin the Navagvas and associated with Indra in the opening of the Vala
cave. The Maruts, though also in Indra’s entourage, are not standard participants in
the Vala myth. Here they seem to be implicitly compared to the Daśagvas but not
identical to them. The point presumably is to associate the Maruts’ thunderstorm
activity, including both the fecundity of the rain, here symbolized by cows, and the
return of the light after the storm, with the powerful mythic image of the opening of
Vala. The move to configure the Maruts’ activity as on a par with the opening of
Vala was already made in the first vs., with the VP in d ápa gā́avṛṇvata “They
unclosed the cows” (see also śuśucānā́ḥ in 1c, comparable to śucatā here).
Describing their light as góarṇas- ‘flooding with cows, whose flood is cows’ is esp.
telling, since it connects their floods of rain with the cows of the Vala myth. I supply
cows as the obj. of áporṇute in the frame on the basis of 1d, but it might be better to
take rāmī́ḥ, here tr. ‘nights’, as ‘dark (things)’, referring to nights in the simile but
clouds in the frame. Hence a slightly revised tr. “As Dawn &hellip; uncloses the dark
(nights), so did they unclose the dark (clouds) …”</p>
<h3 id="3413">34.13</h3>
<p>On this vs. see Thieme KZ 92: 43–44, though his etym. of rudrá- (n. 34) as
‘tree-breaking’ (&lt; dru-dra-) is best passed over in silence. His explanation of kṣoṇī́-
as ‘cry’, here standing for thunder, is convincing. With that interpr., we can see the
vs. proceed through thunder, lightning (the ornaments), rain (horse’s piss), and poststorm sunshine (or even rainbow).</p>
<h3 id="3414">34.14</h3>
<p>The syntax of this vs. is quite broken: a nom. sg. participle (iyānáḥ) in pāda
a is followed by a 1st pl. verb (gṛṇīmasi), but cd has a 3rd sg. verb (āvavártat) that
may (or may not) pick up the sg. subj. of a. The vs. is also notable for the return of
Trita (see 10cd above), whose function is no clearer here than there.
With regard to the number/person mismatch of ab, Ge’s notion that both the
3rd sg. and the 1st pl. refer to ritual personnel seems convincing. If we take a and b as
separate clauses, note that the first one has a predicated pres. participle. Since in the
dependent cl. of cd the rel. prn. (yā́n) has tā́n in a as its antencedent (both referring to
the Maruts), it seems reasonable to assume that the same subject is working on both:
the poet (supplied) who implores them in pāda a will cause them to turn here in cd,
presumably by means of his imploring words.
It is the simile that is puzzling, though its syntax is impeccable: Trita
corresponds to the unnamed subj. of āvavártat, the 5 Hotars to the Maruts expressed
by the rel. prn. yā́n. But under what circumstances and for what reason did Trita
make the Hotars turn to him, and who were these Hotars? Priests are not usually
imported from elsewhere, esp. not from above/heaven (as is implied). I have no
solution.

II.35 Apām Napāt
The hymn is much translated; in addition to the standard ones, see Macdonell
(VRS), Doniger, Maurer.
II.35.1–4: The first words of each hemistich in this series of vss. echo each other: 1a
úpem, 1c apā́m, 2a imám, 2c apā́m, 3a sám, 3c tám, 4a tám. Since similar openings
are found only in scattered vss. later in the hymn (9a apā́m, 11c yám, 12c sám) I
consider the effect deliberate.</p>
<h3 id="351">35.1</h3>
<p>It is somewhat curious that the hymn begins with the expression “I have set
loose my eloquence,” with the augmented aor. asṛkṣi. Such phrases are more usual in
the final vss. of hymns, summing up the hymn that has just been produced. Perhaps
here the poet means that he has set his eloquence in motion, in preparation for hymn
composition. IH suggests it’s a performative “I (have) (hearby) set loose …”
kuvíd ordinarily appears with accented verb. Gr allows an unaccented verb
only when the particle and the verb are in different pāda &ndash; but in other passages
where kuvíd and the verb are not in the same pāda the verb can nonetheless be
accented, e.g., VIII.91.4cd, VIII.103.9, IX.19.5. (In VII.91.1 the verb is accented
though it is in a different pāda, but it may also be in a relative clause &ndash; though see
comm. ad loc.) It would be possible to take kuvíd here as construed only with
āśuhémā “surely the Child of the Waters is one impelling swift (horses); he will
make (the hymns) well-ornamented.” But this seems rather artificial. Perhaps karati
lost the expected accent because the hí induced accent of jóṣisat was more
syntactically prominent. In any case the unaccented verb vanate in V.3.10 (cited by
Gr) is also difficult not to construe with the kuvíd in the previous pāda. Gr’s rule
seems to be variable: in addition to the accented verbs in different clauses cited
above, there is at least one example of an unaccented verb in the same clause &ndash;
V.36.3 kuvín nú stoṣat … (pace Gr’s accented stóṣan s.v. kuvíd; he gives correct
stoṣat s.v. stu). For further on verbal accentuation with kuvíd see Hettrich, Hypotaxe
151–52.
As Ge (and Re) point out, ‘well-ornamented’ (supéśas-) of hymns means not
only poetically skillful but also receiving adequate recompense from the gods; cf.
vā́japeśas- ‘having prizes as its ornament’ in the preceding hymn (II.34.6), esp. in
conjunction with vājayúḥ ‘seeking prizes’ in our pāda a.</p>
<h3 id="352">35.2</h3>
<p>aryáḥ is morphologically multivalent; I take it as nom. sg. to aryá-, with
most (Gr, Ge [/WG], Macdonell, Thieme [Fremdling], Lubotsky, Maurer). Re
instead interpr. as acc. pl. to arí- (“les êtres-privilégiés”), in apposition to víśvāni …
bhúvanā, and it must be admitted that its position between those two words invites it
to be construed with them. Doniger seems to follow Re (“all noble creatures”), but I
do not understand how she interpr. aryáḥ grammatically. It could also be gen. sg. of
arí- (or nom. pl., though this would not fit syntactically).
57
II.35.3–4: These two vss. are closely knit together verbally. Both contain an
etymological figure, with nom. pl. fem. and acc. sg. masc. derived from the same
root: 3c śúciṃ śúcayo, 4a yuvatáyo yúvānam. The √śuc of 3c recurs in 4c as
śukrébhiḥ, which forms a phonetic figure with adjacent śíkvabhiḥ. The repeated
PREVERB yánti … PREVERB yanti of 3a is echoed by PREVERB yanti of 4b, while 3d
and 4b both end with a formulaic expression in which only the verb varies: 4b …
pári tasthur ā́paḥ, 4d … pári yanti ā́paḥ. And finally 3d, 4b, 4d (and 5c) all end with
forms of áp- ‘water’ (nom. pl., loc. pl.), contrasting with the pāda-initial gen. pl.
apā́m when the god is mentioned (1c, 2c, 3d).</p>
<h3 id="354">35.4</h3>
<p>The descriptor ásmera-, generally taken as a derivative of √smi ‘smile’, is
somewhat curious. It may be simply, as Macd. suggests, that the waters approach
their task seriously, not like light-hearted lovers (sim. Doniger). Or (with Maurer)
that they are shy. But I somehow think that this hapax is expressing something more
particular, though I cannot define it more closely. It may be naturalistic: the circling
waters perhaps whirl around without foam, which might be thought of as smiles. Or
it may be meant to distinguish these attentive females from other natural phenomena:
lightning, especially, is characterized by smiling (see I.168.8) and laughing, and Uṣas
also smiles. Though the waters do gleam (see 3c), they are different from those
bright celestial females, and the point may be to emphasize the two very different
environments in which Apām Napāt finds himself &ndash; the watery and the fiery. Note
that in 9b Apām Napāt “clothes himself in the lightning flash” in 9b, but by then his
assimilation to Agni/Fire is almost complete.</p>
<h3 id="355">35.5</h3>
<p>The identity of the three female goddesses is unclear. They could be, with
Sāy., the three who show up in the Āprī hymns (e.g., II.3.8), Iḍā, Sarasvatī, and
Bhāratī &ndash; though even if so, this does not help much, since the role of those
goddesses is not well defined. A (possibly) different set of three females associated
with Agni is found in II.5.5, but that passage is too obscure to aid interpretation here.
Macd (fld. by Doniger and Maurer) suggests that they are the waters of the three
worlds, but I am not aware of a “waters of the three worlds” trope.
A more acute problem in this vs. is kṛ̥́tā (in sandhi before vowel; Pp kṛ́tāḥ) in
c. There is no agreement as to what stem it belongs to or what grammatical form it
represents. Some simply refuse (or fail) to tr. it (Ge, Doniger, Schaeffer 198–99);
others give it a contextual meaning (Macd ‘breasts’, Re ‘plantes’, Maurer ‘nurses’),
without attempting etymological justification. WG suggest ‘Spinnerinnen’ (female
spinners, spinsters in fact) with a derivation from √kṛt. What makes the word so
difficult is the root accent; it would otherwise be easily interpreted as a past
participle to √kṛ. The most sensible disc. of the word is Old’s. He sees it a sexual
slang, as in the expression kanyāṃ √kṛ, glossing “die Engjungferte” (deflowered
girl). Certainly in English “to make” or “to do” a girl/woman is a perennial slangy
verb for “have sex with,” and one can also adduce the expression “to make (s.o.) a
woman,” for “deflower, have sex with a virgin.” He justifies the accent retraction
from the ppl. kṛtá- (or rather fem. kṛtā́-) on the basis of AiG II.1.19–20, where
58
substantivized adjectives retract their accent. This seems the best hypothesis of a
generally bad lot, and it would fit the context, in that pāda d describes Apām Napāt
sucking the first milk of females who’ve given birth for the first time (if that’s what
pūrvasū́- means; see Scar 620–21) &ndash; which makes sense if the females just lost their
virginity in the preceding pāda. I therefore take the word as an acc. pl. fem. to a
substantivized kṛ́tā- from the ppl. to √kṛ.</p>
<h3 id="356">35.6</h3>
<p>In pāda a the grammatical problem is svàr (to be read as a monosyllable,
[almost] uniquely in the RV). Gr identifies it as an acc., Macd (followed implicitly by
Doniger and Maurer) as an endingless loc., sim. Re. However, the phraseology, esp.
the accented asyá (which identifies asyá as an adjectival demon., not a pronoun) and
the placement of ca (áśvasyā́tra jánimāsyá ca svàḥ, invite, indeed almost impose, a
genitive interpr. Ge achieves this by pronouncing svàr indeclinable (n. 6a). However,
it is possible to see it as an archaic genitive with zero-grade ending *-s, as in Aves.
xuuə̄ṇg &lt; *sh2uuen̯ -s, but with the -r of the nom./acc. leveled into the oblique. See
Klein DGRV I.96, WG.
The identity of the two entities born must also be sorted out. It is possible that
the horse is just a horse, since origin in the water is an equine characteristic (see, e.g.,
I.163.1 adduced by Ge). But it seems likely that the carefully balanced áśvasya …
asyá ca svàḥ refers to two contrasted entities, quite likely the fire (Agni) and the sun
(Sūrya). The obvious way to get that is for the horse to represent fire/Agni and “this
sun” the sun, but I wonder if there isn’t a clever reversal: the “horse” is the sun and
“this sun here” is Agni.
In b the addressee of the impv. pāhi is not identified, though the default
assumption would be Apām Napāt. It is striking that this is the only instance of the
2nd ps. in this entire hymn.
The “raw” (āmá-) fortifications are convincingly explained by Ge as built
from unfired brick. They need not (and in my opinion should not) be further
interpreted as cloud citadels (so Macd, fld. by Maurer and, in part, Doniger).
Specifying that the fortifications be unfired is a cute reversal if Agni is supposed to
be in residence there. It is also possible, if Apām Napāt is at issue, that the reference
is to his residence in the waters, would would most definitely be uncooked/unfired. It
is also of course difficult in this post-Lévi-Strauss age not to put his conceptual spin
on the term “raw,” though exactly how this concept would pertain to this passage is
unclear: perhaps it refers to a place and a society so far away (paráḥ) from Ārya
civilization that it counts as “raw” to Ārya “cooked.”</p>
<h3 id="357">35.7</h3>
<p>Note the slight phonological play &ndash; a: #svá ā́dám(e), b: #svadhā́m.</p>
<h3 id="358">35.8</h3>
<p>Pāda c is a variant on an idea expressed several times elsewhere. that the
other fires are mere twigs of Agni, the god Fire. Cf., e.g., I.59.1 vayā́íd agne
agnáyas te anyé. It seems significant that “the others” are not identified here as fires
but as entities, beings (bhúvanāni) &ndash; in my view, because the identification of Apām
Napāt with Agni that brings the hymn to its climax is only partially complete here,
59
and the poet is being canny about not directly referring to fire, though at the same
time using diagnostic vocabulary and phraseology.
Note the etymological figure #prá jāyante … prajā́bhiḥ#.</p>
<h3 id="359">35.9</h3>
<p>This is a transition vs. from the watery to the fiery. “Those sloping/aslant” in
b can be the waters flowing downward, but they can also be firewood piled to be
kindled (cf. I.95.5, where the same phrase seems to refer to firewood, as I interpret
it), and the golden-hued maidens who circle around him can be either waters or
flames.</p>
<h3 id="3510">35.10</h3>
<p>This vs. strenuously develops the “golden” theme that appeared in 9d &ndash; a
color more descriptive of the fiery than the watery. An even stronger indication of
the transition to Agni proper is the gerund niṣádyā ‘having sat down’: the lexeme ní
√sad is closely associated with Agni’s installation on the ritual ground (see, e.g., the
next hymn, II.36.4).</p>
<h3 id="3511">35.11</h3>
<p>See disc. in the publ. intro. on this as the climactic vs. of the hymn &ndash; both
introducing unambiguous fire references and identifying Apām Napāt as the secret
name of Agni.
II.35.10–11: The ends of the d pādas in these vss. are very similar: 10d … ánnam
asmai, 11d … ánnam asya. In 10d “The givers of gold give food to him” implies that
his food is gold; 11d further makes clear that the gold(en) food is really gold-colored
ghee.</p>
<h3 id="3512">35.12</h3>
<p>The verb mā́rjmi is accented because of its juxtaposition with clause-initial
dídhiṣāmi.</p>
<h3 id="3513">35.13</h3>
<p>As Old noted (see also Hoffmann, Injunk., 121 n. 29), the need for a caesura
suggests a reading vṛ́ṣā janayat, rather than the augmented ajanayat of the Pp. (In
fact, this suggestion is already found in Gr.) That two pres. indicatives, dhayati and
rihanti, follow this proposed injunctive in the same thematic sequence supports
interpreting the form contra the Pp, as Hoffmann points out.
The simile anyásyeva .. tanvā̀“as if with the body of another” is, in my view,
another reference to the distinction between but ultimate identification of Apām
Napāt and Agni.</p>
<h3 id="3514">35.14</h3>
<p>The acc. participial phrases of ab must be construed with pári dīyanti “they
fly around (him)” in d, even though the same referent is found in the dat. in náptre in
c. The latter participates in a clever word play &ndash; ā́po náptre &ndash; which of course
evokes apā́m nápāt even though ā́paḥ is nom. pl. fem. ‘waters’ and not part of a
syntagm with náptre. The elision of the first part of his name may be meant: now that
he is identified with Agni, he is no longer the child (only) of the waters. But as noted
in the publ. intro., that the waters bring him ghee brings the watery and the fiery into
60
harmony. Note that the waters as his cloak here (if I am correct in this interpr., see
below) answers to the ghee-cloak in 4d. In the watery vs. 4 the presence of ghee was
somewhat anomalous; similarly here in a mostly fiery environment the cloak of the
waters stands out.
The phrase svayám átkaiḥ is also unclear, and indeed whether it is actually a
phrase. Ge takes it as referring to Apām Napāt: “und sich selbst mit Gewändern
(bekleidet).” He adduces IV.18.5 with svayáṃ átkaṃ vásāna(ḥ), but in fact the
difference in case between the acc. there and the instr. here speaks against his interpr.
The simplex root pres. always takes the acc. of the garment, while the causative
vāsáya- takes the instr. Moreover, as Lü points out (Varuṇa, 146–47 n. 8), the
position of this phrase (far from the masc. acc. sg. in ab, adjacent to the fem. nom. pl.
in d) and the “harsh ellipsis” required makes this interpr. unlikely. Lü himself in his
tr. (146) implies the waters are bringing the ghee with their cloaks, though in the n.
he sees them as “in Schmelzbutter gekleidet.” Acdg. to Re the waters fly around him
“avec des vêtements (qu’elles se sont donnés) elles-mêmes,” an expression I don’t
entirely understand. WG appear to separate svayám and átkaiḥ but, with Lü, Re, and
me, also take the garments as belonging to the waters: “um ihn fliegen die
jugendfrischen Wasser von sich selbst mit (ihren) Reisemänteln herum.” The further
(and perhaps unjustified) step I take in my tr. is in interpreting svayám so closely
with átkaiḥ, with the waters themselves becoming cloaks for him.
In b ‘paths’ is to be supplied with adhvasmábhiḥ ‘unbesmirched’ on the basis
of II.34.5 adhvasmábhiḥ pathíbhiḥ in the adjacent hymn, at least by my interpr. The
standard tr. (Ge [/WG, Re, also Lü, 146) supply ‘flames’ instead (though Re in his n.
suggests that “chemins” could be supplied). Where exactly he is located (“highest
footprint” generally implies high heaven) and which pathways are meant are unclear
to me.</p>

<p>The first pāda lacks a syllable, which can be restored by reading augmented
avasiṣṭa. In the position after the final -o of hinvānó, the Saṃhitā text could have
applied abhinihita sandhi to initial a redactionally, but the transmitted text never
acquired an avagraha. This solution was already noted by Gr and endorsed by Old;
Hoffmann discusses it extensively (Injunk. 147).</p>

<p>The standard tr. construe añjíṣu with priyā́utá (“and dear in your

if priyā́ḥ is all that it’s conjoining. And añjíṣu goes better semantically with
“resplendent” than “dear”; cf., for a connection with √śubh, X.78.7 śubhaṃyávo

Despite the masc. gender of devébhiḥ, I do not think it identifies a different
group from the wives (jánibhiḥ), but that the latter further specifies the neutral
devébhiḥ. In this I follow Re ad VI.50.13, which contains the same phrase (also
X.64.10). Tvaṣṭar is strongly associated with the wives of the gods and in all clear
cases only with them. It is worth noting that the RV contains no examples of fem.
instr. pl. devī́bhiḥ or indeed of any fem. oblique plural.
My tr. of jujuṣānáḥ “having delighted (in the call),” with “call” supplied,
followed a claim in John Lowe’s Oxford Univ. dissertation (p. 162) that this pf. part.
only occurs with “call,” as a prior action to the event time of the matrix verb. But in
the book based on his diss. (Participles in Rigvedic Sanskrit, 2015) he has revised
this view, at least for this passage and allows jujuṣāṇáḥ to be construed with
ándhasaḥ, with the main verb mandasva ‘become exhilarated!’ logically following
the action of enjoyment (pp. 210–11, 214–15; passage tr. on 215). I would tentatively
revise the publ. tr. to “having delighted, become exhilarated on the stalk!” Because of
the VP mándasva … ándhasaḥ in the first vs. of the next, closely related hymn
(II.36.1) I do not take ándhasaḥ with jujuṣāṇáḥ here, or at least not primarily.</p>
<h3 id="364">36.4</h3>

<p>This vs. is generally taken as Indra’s, but as I say in the publ. intro., I think it

<p>As noted above ad II.36.3 the VP mándasva … ándhasaḥ repeats the same

II.37.1–3: The d pādas of the first three vss. have a rigid structure: PRIEST’S CUP
sómaṃ draviṇodaḥ píbartúbhiḥ. Noteworthy is only that píba is accented in all three
vss., though there is no obvious reason for this, and the last three vss. (4–6), which
also contain imperatives to √pā, though of different form (4d pibatu, 5d pibatam, 6d
pāyayā), in syntactically variant constructions, lack such accent. I have no
explanation (and it seems not to have attracted any attention) beyond the suggestion
that píbartúbhiḥ is treated as a detachable refrain, even though what precedes it in the
pāda must be construed with it. See now also remarks ad III.32.1.</p>

62
VI.47.26 cited by both Ge and Re. Why the chariot is addressed and identified with
the wealth-giver is not clear to me, save for the fact that in the later ritual the
Ṛtugraha libations take place in the cart shed (see, e.g., Eggeling, SBE 26.319–20).

<p>Another ex. of hí with the first of two imperatives, providing the grounds for

<h2 id="38-1">38</h2>
<p>Savitar
The word vratá- ‘commandment’ is prominent in this hymn (vss. 2, 3, 6, 7, 9).
The point is repeatedly made that all creatures, incl. the gods, follow the vratá-s of
Savitar. Another persistent verbal theme is the contrast between sám and ví (4a, 4c,
6a), which can be discerned even when only ví is present (1c, 3a, 5b, 6c, 7b, 8d). The
hymn also has a pronounced tendency towards augmented 3rd sg. root aorists (+/-
preverb) at the ends of pādas, esp. at the ends of hemistichs: 1b asthāt, 3d ā́gāt, 4d
ā́gāt, 5c ā́dhāt, 6b abhūt, 6c ā́gāt, 8c (ā́…) gāt, 8d ā́kaḥ, 11b ā́gāt (cf. also opt.
avyāḥ 10b).</p>
<h3 id="381">38.1</h3>
<p>The verb of c, dhā́ti with primary ending, can only be a root aorist
subjunctive like the other two such forms, though neither Ge nor Re so tr. it &ndash; nor do
I. However, WG’s “… soll er … verteilen” does represent the mood (so also
Hettrich, Hyp. 177). I would emend the publ. tr. to “will distribute …” Unfortunately
it does not require trisyllabic scansion, which would have supported the subj. interpr.
The question then arises how to analyze ā́bhajat in d. The Pp. takes it as ā́
abhajat, with unaccented augment. Under this analysis the verb would not be in the
domain of the hí in c; otherwise the augment should be accented and the preverb
unaccented and univerbated. The WG tr. reflects the Pp. by separating the clauses,
but Ge, Re, and I (implicitly also Klein DGRV II.74) tr. cd as if they contain
conjoined parallel clauses. It would also be possible to analyze ā́bhajat as ā́bhajat,
that is, without augment. An injunctive might fit the syntactic context better, in that it
could just continue the modal reading of dhā́ti (“will distribute … and [will] give a
share …”), but paradoxically this would require the two clauses to be more
independent because the verb would be unaccented and therefore could not be
conjoined to c with accent-inducing hí. In larger interpretational terms the
differences among the several possibilities just outlined are fairly minor &ndash; having
just given or being about to give actually turn out to be almost identical acts in
Rigvedic ritual depiction &ndash; but it is worth noting the multiple ambiguities inherent in
an innocent looking form. For two parallel clauses containing first a subjunctive and
then an augmented indicative, see 3ab below (mucāti … árīramat).
63</p>
<h3 id="382">38.2</h3>
<p>The hapax nímṛgra- must clearly be a derivative of ní √mṛj, lit. ‘wipe down’,
but generally either ‘clasp to oneself’ or idiomatically ‘drag down’ (for the latter see
I.140.2, V.52.17). The context here requires something like ‘submissive’, as all tr.
take it. See comm. ad VII.26.3, which suggests that forceful dragging down implies
coercion by the agent and, conversely, submission (voluntary or not) of the object.
Note also that it has an unetymological velar g, presumably extracted from forms
where the final palatal j, followed by s-, yields -kṣ-.
The submission of the waters and, especially, the quieting of the wind
probably reflect the natural fact that the wind tends to drop at dusk, and this brings
about calming of waves that had been raised by the wind.</p>
<h3 id="383">38.3</h3>
<p>The poet seems to get a certain pleasure out of using semi-exotic verb forms
that masquerade as something else: in pāda a yā́n, the nom. sg. pres. part. of √yā
‘drive’, not the acc. pl. m. of the rel. prn.; in c rhyming ayām̐(&lt; ayān &lt; *ayāṃst), 3rd
sg. s-aor. to √yam. There is also the abl. inf. étoḥ in b.
The creatures that the hapax ahyárṣu- (‘snakes-stickers’, Ge (/WG), Falk
‘Schlangenspiesser’, Re ‘qui picquent les serpents’) refers to cannot be determined
for certain. The consensus is that it is some kind of bird of prey; Ge suggests (n. 3c)
the Schlangenadler. Indeed, the short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus) is widespread in India and feeds mainly on snakes (so Wikipedia). The internet (including
You Tube) has some remarkable photos and videos of this bird fighting with,
swallowing, and feeding its young with snakes, including cobras. The photos with
sizable lengths of snake dribbling out of their mouths and esp. the video of one
wolfing down a still wriggling spectacled cobra certainly testify to the greed or
avidity of these birds. Whether they stop hunting at evening I have no idea.</p>
<h3 id="384">38.4</h3>
<p>Though Sāy., Old, and Re identify the weaver as Night, this seems unlikely,
if the hymn really depicts the evening. More likely a real human weaver, finishing
her daily work.
Note the unetym. phonetic echoes in avyat … váyantī.
On the semantic and functional nuance of the intensive adardhar, see
Schaeffer (Intens., 140–41). The form should be an impf. (see pres. dárdharṣi), and
Schaeffer notes that an the iterative value generally expressed by intensives is not
appropriate to an aorist, despite rather insistent aoristic context here. She suggests
that ádardhar in contrast to the surrounding verbs “bezieht sich nicht auf die
unmittelbar vorangegangene Handlung des Gottes, sondern nennt eine Tätigkeit, die
er von alterns vollbracht hat; die Funktion des Intensivums dürfte eine kontinuative
sein: ‘sich aufraffend ist er aufgestanden; (fortwährend) hielt er die Jahreszeiten
auseinander; bereiten Sinnes ist der Gott Savitr̥gekommen.’” My &lsquo;always&rsquo; is an
attempt at reconciling this.
Pāda-initial arámatiḥ ‘Proper Thinking’ echoes pāda-initial árīramat (3b) (see
also ramate 2d), though they are of course etymologically unrelated. I now think a
pun is meant here, with arámati- analyzed as a privative a-rámati- and I would
emend the tr. to “As Proper Thinking (/unresting) …”
64</p>
<h3 id="385">38.5</h3>
<p>ví tiṣṭhate should be evaluated in conjunction with víṣṭhitaḥ in 6a and ví
tasthuḥ in 7b.
Ge (/WG) take a and b as separate clauses (sim. Falk). My rendering is closer
to Re’s. I think the idea is that Agni/Fire, though in some ways a single entity, is
parcelled out into separate domestic fires, one per household, and this holds for a
man’s whole lifetime after he has set up his household fire. The coming of night
brings the (re-)kindling of these fires and so they come into visual prominence then.
The blazing up of the home fire is accompanied by the evening meal, rather
charmingly depicted here: the mother reserving the best of it for her son; the son with
his appetite stimulated by the coming of evening.</p>
<h3 id="386">38.6</h3>
<p>The first pāda of this vs. takes up the idiom ví √sthā ‘disperse’ found in 5b
and applies it somewhat differently. Here it refers to all those who were dispersed in
various directions pursuing their livelihoods &ndash; who all want to come home in the
evening. On jigīṣú- see Narten (Yasna H., 122); as she makes clear, the desid. of √ji
in both Vedic and Avestan lacks martial or battle context and is simply about gaining
food and so on. See also Heenen (Desid. 120–25).
The verb samā́vavarti is taken by Kü (465–66) as a (pseudo-)passive aor. to
√vṛt, with ref. to Hoffmann (Aufs. II.589–92), a form that is attested also after the
RV (see Kü n. 884). The lexeme sám-ā́√vṛt is used in the causative of Dawn’s cows
rolling up the darkness (VII.79.2), so here I think the nuance is the gathering or
rolling up together of everything that was dispersed during the day, playing on the
common opposition between ví and sám that is prominent in this hymn.
Although we might expect víkṛtam to mean ‘badly/wrongly done’, I think the
dominant sám / ví play in this hymn trumps that, and if sáṃskr̥ta- is ‘perfected,
brought to completion’, víkrtḁ - can mean ‘incomplete, not done’.
II.38.7–8: These two vss. have been variously interpr. My interpr. is most influenced
by Old (whose views also seems to have been adopted by WG). As noted in the publ.
intro., the vss. enumerates the separate spheres assigned to the various categories of
creatures by Savitar, as an extension of his ability to bring every creature to its
proper resting place at night.</p>
<h3 id="387">38.7</h3>
<p>In my view, this vs. divides the world into habitats for fish (etc.), wild beasts,
and birds. Not surprisingly the watery creatures are placed in water (pāda a). As head
noun with ápyam I supply jánma from the summary pāda of this two-vs. sequence,
8d.
The problem in 7a is bhāgám: it is tempting to tr. “the watery (race) has been
placed by you among the waters as their share,” but bhāgám belongs to a masc. stem
and must be acc., which does not accord with the nominal clause in which it would
purportedly be found. I therefore construe this last word of pāda a with b, as an
appositive to acc. pl. dhánva ‘wastelands’. Although I would prefer to avoid such
enjambment, I see no better choice, and note that a new clause also begins in the
65
middle of pāda c (with nákiḥ) and continues to the end of d. Sim. also 9c. Ge’s
interpr., which keeps bhāgám within its pāda by making the whole pāda acc., seems
to me to come at too high a cost: he must supply a set of fishermen and a verb ‘seek’
to govern the acc. (“[Fisherman seek] their watery share ..”); these imaginary
fishermen are parallel to the “hunters” that he takes mṛgayásaḥ to be, dispersed
across the dry land (and presumably hunting wild beasts). I see several conceptual
problems with this interpr. For one thing this makes the first two pādas non-parallel
with c, for there are no bird-catchers there (Vedic Papagenos?), whereas in my
interpr. the three pādas describe the habitats of three types of creatures. Moreover,
the hunting has no obvious connection with Savitar, whereas by my interpr. the
distribution of habitats is his doing – and is summed up by 8d “Savitar has
distributed the races according to their stations.” Nor is the hunting likely to be an
activity of night, the other thematic connection it might have to the rest of the hymn:
everyone else has gone home, but hunters are out on the plains trying to shoot deer in
the dark? For penetrating arguments against the Ge interpr. see Old’s n. 3 ad loc.
Pāda b has its own problem, the anomalous form mṛgayásaḥ. Ge (n. 7ab)
declares that mṛgayás- can only mean ‘hunter’, but gives no evidence for his
certainty. Old’s disc. is more to the point (and rather tart about the ‘hunter’ interpr.),
though his morphological analysis of it as an -as-derivative of the denom. mṛgayseems a little shaky (likewise his alternative explan. as a cmpd. of loc. mṛgé + √as
‘shoot’, like hṛtsv-ás- [see Scar 41], with older sandhi and a meaning ‘auf das Wild
schiessend’, which unfortunately smuggles in Ge’s hunters in another guise). On the
other hand, I don’t have anything better to offer. It reminds us of a suffix-accented
masc. deriv. like rakṣás- ‘demon’ next to neut. rákṣas- ‘demonic force’, which itself
gets personified. But the assumed base *mṛ́gayas- (or *mṛgáyas-) ‘wild-beast-iness’
doesn’t exist and it’s hard to see to what it would be generated. AiG II.2.223
dismisses the word with a ? and a ref. to Old’s disc. In any case, Old’s structural
arguments that it must refer to the beasts, not the hunters are sound. A third
occurrence of ví √sthā is found in this pāda.
The asya in pāda c anticipates devásya savitúḥ in d – perhaps better to tr. as
Ge does: “… diese seine Gebote, des Gottes Savitar.” This doubling may have arisen
because the clause begins in the middle of a pāda and continues over the pāda break.</p>
<h3 id="388">38.8</h3>
<p>The general purport of this vs. is clear: it both summarizes Savitar’s
distribution of the creatures (esp. in pāda d) and hints (esp. in pāda c) at their return
to their own special places at night. But the first half-verse is quite challenging and
my interp. is not fully worked out.
On yādrādhyàm see Old’s disc. My publ. tr. “As far as (Savitar’s) benefit
extends” is, I’m afraid, opaque. What it means to convey is that Varuṇa’s presence in
his watery womb is at the favor of Savitar, whose distribution of the creatures in
their proper places extends even to the gods, or at least one of them. A modern
equivalent might be the phrase “to serve at the pleasure of (e.g.) the president.” The
dependence of Varuṇa (and other gods) on Savitar’s orders and ordering is stated
plainly in the next vs., 9ab. It is esp. striking that Varuṇa follows Savitar’s vratá-,
66
since the vratá- is primarily Varuṇa’s domain. That Varuṇa is the only god named
here is probably meant to emphasize what might almost be seen as Savitar’s
usurpation of the power and role of Varuṇa. Savitar’s rā́dhas- recurs in 11b.
This passage shows one of the early examples of what becomes Varuṇa’s
principal association, that with water. Again, it may be that Savitar is deliberately
relegating him to this restricted role. Varuṇa’s hypervigilance, familiar from other,
more standard treatments of Varuṇa in the RV, is undeterred by his watery
environment, as pāda b indicates.
Note the phonological play in ániṣitaṃ nimíṣi.
The sense of nimíṣi is unclear. My tr. “at (every) blink of the eye” takes it as
an implicit āmreḍita with the frequenative járbhurāṇaḥ; it could also be an indication
of the great speed of Varuṇa’s movements, like English “in the blink of an eye.”
However it shouldn’t be forgotten that the idiom ní √miṣ is associated with the gods
and esp. the Āditya—generally in its negation: the gods (or their spies) “never blink”
(cf., e.g., IX.73.4, X.10.8, 63.4). For Mitra and Varuṇa or the Ādityas see VII.60.7,
61.3, VII.25.9, and esp. nearby II.27.8 asvapnajo animi ́ ṣā́ádabdhāḥ “unsleeping,
unblinking, undeceivable” (of the Ādityas). Is the blinking here (as opposed to the
usual non-blinking) another of Savitar’s subtle put-downs of Varuṇa, implying that
he does blink after all?
In c mārtāṇḍá- is taken by the standard tr. (also Lüders, Varuṇa I.50) as
‘bird’, and this could work well, corresponding to 7c, where the birds are assigned to
the forests. However, note that in vs. 7 the other member of the trio of creatures,
besides the watery, is the wild beast (7b), whereas here instead of a wild beast we
have precisely a domesticated one, the paśú-. Its formulaic partner is mārtāṇḍá-, lit.
‘stemming from a dead egg’, found otherwise in the RV in the creation hymn
X.72.8–9 in the myth of Aditi and the birth of her sons. The last son born (or rather
the egg miscarried), mārtāṇḍá-, is the ancestor of mortals; for disc. of the word and
the myth see Hoffmann 1976 (=1992: 723). That half of this vs. is devoted to Varuṇa
and the next vs. has the great trio of Aditi’s sons, Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman,
provides further evidence that the Mārtāṇḍa of the Aditi birth story is meant. Under
this interpr., the domestic herd animal (paśú-) is paired with the likewise
domesticated human, each in its own pen.</p>
<h3 id="389">38.9</h3>
<p>The first hemistich restates 7cd in almost the same words, but instead of the
indefinite nákiḥ ‘no one’ specified as the non-violator of Savitar’s vratá-, a selection
of the greatest gods serve as subject.</p>
<h3 id="3810">38.10</h3>
<p>As Ge points out (n. 10a), the three divinized principles in pāda a—Good
Fortune, Insight, and Plenitude—are what the poet needs for success.
As the layout of the publ. tr. shows, I take pāda b as a parenthetical insertion
in the sentence that includes a, cd. It would be possible to take vājáyantaḥ as a
predicated pres. part. and a separate cl., though this seems less likely to me.
Although gnā́spáti- presumably contains the old gen. sg. of gnā́- (e.g., AiG
III.119, 129), I tr. it as a pl., since we usually hear of “wives (of the gods)” – though,
67
since I don’t exactly know what Narāśaṃsa (=Agni?) is doing here, perhaps there’s
only one wife. It is also not clear if there are two figures here or if gnā́spátiḥ
characterizes Narāśaṃsa as I have taken it (so also Ge, WG). Re does so in tr., but
suggests in his n. that it might identify a separate individual, perhaps Tvaṣṭar, whose
association with divine females is well established. I now am inclined in that
direction and would provide an alternate tr. “Narāśaṃsa (and) the Husband of the
(divine) Wives should help us.” That the verb is singular is not an impediment, since
a series of sg. subjects can take a sg. verb.
This verb, avyāḥ, is a bit of a problem. It is isolated in the averbo of the root
√av ‘help’, which is seṭ and has a well-attested iṣ-aor. (on which see Narten 86–89)
beside the even better attested them. pres. Although Narten (86) identifies our avyā́ḥ
(also X.139.5) as belonging to an old root aor. (with maintenance of the full grade
despite despite being opt.), there are no other unambig. root aor. forms attested
(though forms like ā́vīt could of course belong to a seṭ root aor. paradigm and have
given rise to the iṣ-aor.). I think it’s more likely an artificial form, makeshift
replacement for the non-existent iṣ-aor. opt. (see my 2009 “Where Are All the
Optatives?” pp. 31–32 on the absence of act. sigmatic optatives, flg. Narten), as well
as the relative dearth even of 3rd sg. thematic optatives to present stems (like ávati),
on which see the same art., pp. 32–34.
As for the point of the pāda: it is possible that the arousing of the three
principles in pāda a reminds the poet that he needs the help of the ritual fire (if
Narāśaṃsa is identified with Agni here). Perhaps gnā́spátiḥ is invoked because two
of the three principles are female. But this seems like groping in the dark.</p>
<h3 id="3811">38.11</h3>
<p>The verb ā́gāt is interpr. by the Pp as injunc gāt and so treated in most
editions and tr., but it could just as well be augmented agāt, a typical aorist in a
summary vs.
[II.39 JPB]
II.40 Soma and Pūṣan</p>
<h3 id="401">40.1</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. does not capture the etymological play between the transitive
nominal jánana- (3x in ab) and the first word of the 2nd hemistich, intrans.-passive
jātá-, which could have been tr. ‘begotten’ to reflect this etym. figure. However, this
tr. seems a little stiff and would not work with jā́yamānau in 2a.
It is only in d that it becomes clear that the dual nominal phrases in the first 3
pādas are in the acc. and are the obj. of akṛṇvan.</p>
<h3 id="402">40.2</h3>
<p>The etym. figure involving √jan noted ad vs. 1 continues here with intrans.-
pass. jā́yamānau (a) and transitive janat (d). Another figure involves √juṣ ‘enjoy’,
likewise with trans. vs. pass. manifestations: juṣanta (a), ájuṣtā (b), both pāda-final.
This vs. contains three injunctives: juṣanta (a), gūhatām (b), janat (d), the
middle one of which could also be an impv. Ge takes all three as preterital, a course I
68
also follow, but Re takes gūhatām as impv. (flg. Gr); WG take the first two as
presential and the last as preterital. There seems no decisive evidence for or against
any of these choices (or the others that could be made). On the one hand imaú (2x,
ab) and ābhyā́m (c) ‘these two (here)’ would support a here-and-now presential
and/or imperatival reading, as perhaps also the pres. part. jā́yamānau in a. On the
other, it seems unlikely that the gods would be currently celebrating the birth of
Pūṣan (Soma might be another story), and, as for b, inserting an imperative into the
mix seems odd to me.
Another ambiguity is posed by ābhyā́m … somāpūṣ́abhyām in cd, which can
be instr., dat., or abl. dual. Ge takes it as instr.: Indra performed this feat along with
the two gods; Re and WG (see also Hoffmann, Injunk. 124, 193–94) as a dat.: Indra
did it for them. I also interpr. the phrase as a dat. &ndash; though not with any strong
conviction. On the one hand this deed (putting “raw” milk into “cooked” cows) is
almost always attributed to Indra alone, so having Soma and Pūṣan as his
accomplices seems somewhat unlikely. But on one occasion (VI.72.4) it&rsquo;s attributed
to Indra and Soma in a dual dvandva índrāsomā. However, that hymn basically lays
out Indra&rsquo;s great deeds and attributes them to Indra and Soma jointly, so there&rsquo;s no
independent evidence of Soma&rsquo;s involvement in this action. As for how they could
benefit from the exploit and thus be in the dative &ndash; Soma would benefit from the
creation of milk because he (or the ritual substance bearing his name) is mixed with
milk in the Soma Sacrifice (a point also made by WG). But what Pūṣan would gain
from it isn’t clear &ndash; unless he likes milk with his habitual food, porridge (karambhá-
). (We should probably be wary of reading Anglo-American breakfast habits back
into Vedic India.)</p>
<h3 id="403">40.3</h3>
<p>The referent of this marvellous chariot is disputed. Sāy suggested the year,
Lüders (Varuṇa, 690) the sun, Ge the praise-song, the sacrifice, or the wish that the
gods bring. As Re points out, a choice does not have to be made; the interpretation is
“volontairement polyvalente.” However, I assume that the primary reading is the
sacrifice and its associated verbal expression, as so often.
The surprising descriptor of this chariot is áviśvaminva- ‘not speeding/moving
everyone’. This word has to be evaluated alongside its positive counterpart,
viśvaminvá-, used of Pūṣan in 6a. In both that verse and this one Pūṣan (in this vs.
along with Soma) is the subj. of √jinv ‘quicken’. This oppositional phraseology
favors Old’s suggestion that the chariot lacks something required to “move
everyone” until Pūṣan (and Soma) provide the enlivening push. However, Ge’s quite
different suggestion, that the chariot only carries gods and qualified priests, gets
support from the only other occurrence of áviśvaminva-, in the riddle hymn,
I.164.10, where the gods (probably) speak speech that knows everything but does not
move everyone (viśvavídaṃ vā́cam áviśvaminvām), a formulation that probably
refers to profound speech that only affects initiates or those with already prepared
minds. As with the identity of the chariot itself, probably both interpr. can be
simultaneously applied.

In the publ. tr. vṛ́ṣaṇā appears to be tr. as a voc.; it is not, and the tr. might be
clearer as “that do you two bulls quicken.”</p>
<h3 id="404">40.4</h3>
<p>The standard assumption (Ge [/WG], Re) is that pāda a refers to Pūṣan and b
to Soma, but the opposition between celestial and terrestrial/atmospheric dwelling
places doesn’t seem to me to divide so neatly. Pūṣan seems often to be an earthly
god, accompanying us on the ragged roads, finding our lost cattle, and Soma
certainly has a celestial presence throughout the IXth Maṇḍala. I imagine that this
contrastive pairing is meant to be a genuine riddle, which would require its audience
to try out different solutions by bringing to mind everything they know about both
gods and trying to match those characteristics with the description in this vs.
The two different acc. phrases in cd can both be construed with the verb that
lies between them, ví ṣyatām. There seems no reason to supply a diff. verb to govern
the first acc. phrase as Ge and Re do. The slightly diff. renderings “unleash” and
“unloose” in the pub. tr. were simply adapted to better fit their objects.</p>
<h3 id="405">40.5</h3>
<p>The contrastive anyáḥ … anyáḥ is generally taken to refer to Soma (a) and
Pūṣan (b) respectively (Ge [/WG], Re). But the differential characterizations in this
vs. seem even less easily assigned than in the preceding vs. “Begetting all creaures”
isn’t a standard action attributed to Soma; in fact the same deed is said to be Apām
Napāt’s in nearby II.35.2. And Ge can attribute “watching over everything” to Pūṣan
only by identifying him with the sun god, while Soma regularly gazes on things, even
with the same participle: cf. the very similar IX.57.2 víśvā cákṣāṇo arṣati “he
[=Soma] rushes gazing on all (things/beings).” Again I think this differentiation is
meant to be genuinely puzzling and provoke thought in the audience.</p>
<h3 id="406">40.6</h3>
<p>Fem. anarvā́here (and VII.40.4) is assigned to the thematic stem anarvá- by
Gr. I think it more likely that it is simply the nom. sg. to the well-attested -n-stem
anarván-, serving for the fem. as well as the masc., without the fem. derivational
suffix -ī.
II.41 Various gods
II.41.1–3: This tṛca is characterized by lexical chaining. The first pāda of vs. 2
reprises niyútvān from 1c, vāyo from (accented) vā́yo (1a), and ā́gahi (1b). Vs. 3 is
less closely tied to what precedes, but śukrá- ‘clear’, which characterizes the first
drink of soma, offered to Vāyu, is repeated in 3a from 2b, and niyútvant- also recurs
from 1c and 2a. The impv. píbatam (3c) picks up (sóma-)pītaye from 1c. More
subtly, ā́yātam repeats the preverb of ā́gahi (1b, 2a) and also echoes the unrelated
verb ayāmi of 2b.</p>
<h3 id="413">41.3</h3>
<p>The stem niyútvant- (3b) is repeated from 1c and 2a, as noted above, but here
as an apparent gen. sg. modifying the soma drink (or rather one of them), not a god
or gods. Ge (n. 3b) suggests that it is a metrically conditioned “hypallage” for dual
70
niyútvantā, which would qualify Indra and Vāyu. This is a clever idea and would
restore parallelism to the phraseology of the tṛca, though I’m not sure that’s
necessary: Rigvedic poets enjoy tweaking parallelism in the syntactic equivalent of a
slant rhyme. Old floats a truly oddball idea, unworthy of his usual acuity: that
niyútvant- should modify an unexpressed ráthena but in the absence of a head noun
in the proper case it gets sucked [not Old’s term] into the gen. by the “benachbarte”
gen. Even if this were a reasonable explanation in principle &ndash; that an untethered adj.
could be captured by an adjacent or nearby word in another case &ndash; niyútvataḥ is
actually in a different pāda from the other genitives and is adjacent only to the dual
dvandva índrāvāyū.</p>
<h3 id="415">41.5</h3>
<p>Note the phonological echo across the pāda boundary: … druhā, dhruvé …</p>
<h3 id="4111">41.11</h3>
<p>The ca here is a subordinator (‘if’) and conditions accent on mṛḷáyāti. See
II.42.1.
There are several nice phonetic sequences: ab: … no, ná naḥ, where the 1st
and last words are the same, with naśat at the end. And c: bhadrám bhavāti.</p>
<h3 id="4112">41.12</h3>
<p>I am tempted to take jétā as a periphr. future, parallel as it is to the
subjunctive karat. But this is not nec.</p>
<h3 id="4115">41.15</h3>
<p>On the morphological and semantic structure of pū́ṣarātayaḥ, as well as
other aspects of this vs., see the disc. of the identical vs. I.23.8.</p>
<h3 id="4116">41.16</h3>
<p>Like 15ab, the first two pādas of this vs. consist entirely of accented
vocatives.</p>
<h2 id="42-1">42</h2>
<p>Omen-bird</p>
<h3 id="421">42.1</h3>
<p>Subordinating ca as in II.41.11, also with a subjunctive.
The root noun cmpd. abhibhā́- occurs only here in the RV, but 5x in the AV,
which seems only to make it more obscure. Twice in the phrase “let not abhibhā́or
aśasti find you” (i.e., parallel to this phrase), but also in conjunction with dogs and
jackals once, once abhibhā́-s can speak, and once in conjunction with diseases. Wh.
transl. ‘portent’. Though not a lit. tr., Engl. “evil-eye” seems to correspond well to
the contextual sense of the word; I have adopted it from Klein (DGRV II.240).
Pāda d should be read as a Jagatī, though neither Old nor HvN comment. The
cadence is a Jagatī cadence and the proper number of syllables is achieved by
reading víśvi
yā as a trisyllable (so already Gr, also AiG III.78). The word is otherwise
not found in the RV, but such a cluster begs to be distracted, and by Wackernagel’s
analysis of it as modeled on urviyā́(AiG III.78, flg. Brugmann), it would have -iyā́
by nature.
71</p>
<h3 id="422">42.2</h3>
<p>Similarly, pāda c should also be read as a Jagatī, with trisyllabic pítri
ya-, as
always in the RV</p>
<h3 id="423">42.3</h3>
<p>Although the publ. tr. follows Ge (/WG) in rendering dakṣiṇatáḥ as ‘to the
right’, it is also possible, given 2c pítryam ánu pradíśam “in the direction of the
fathers [that is, forefathers/ancestors],” that dakṣiṇatáḥ should rather be ‘to the
south’, since the south is ordinarily the quarter of the Pitars.
On īśata see comm. ad I.23.9.</p>
<h2 id="43-1">43</h2>
<p>Omen-bird
This hymn seems late enough to allow terms like sāma(n) √gā, gāyatrá-, and
traiṣṭubha- to have their full technical ritual meanings, and I have so rendered them.</p>
<h3 id="431">43.1</h3>
<p>Again as in II.42.3, pradakṣiṇít might refer to ‘south’, rather than ‘right’,
though the idiom prá + dakṣiṇá- seems more limited to the traditional
circumambulation of the fire with the right side facing inward.
Pāda c is somewhat oddly phrased. The vocalizer is identified as a sāmansinger, but is said to speak (both) speech(es). This raises several questions: does a
singer speak? and what are “both speeches”? It is tempting to equate the two
speeches with the two entities in pāda d, gāyatrám and traiṣṭubham, but I am not
certain that is correct. I think it’s possible that “both speeches” refers to the words
and the melody. As for the question of singing versus speech, I wonder if the simile
sāmagā́iva should go rather with d than with c: “It speaks both speeches. Like a
sāman-singer it regulates both Gāyatrī and Triṣṭubh meters.” Unfortunately this
hymn is so isolated in the RV that we have no points of comparison.</p>
<h3 id="432">43.2</h3>
<p>As HvN remark in their metrical comm., although the Anukramaṇī identifies
the meter of this vs. as Atiśakvarī or Aṣṭi, it appears simply to consist of 5 Jagatī
pādas. That the fifth pāda is a simple variant of the fourth makes it likely that the vs.
is just a version of Jagatī.
The “son of the formulation” (brahmaputrá-) is presumably the formulator
(brahmán-) himself, as the standard tr. take it.</p>
<h3 id="433">43.3</h3>
<p>The provision of sitting silently reminds us of the actions and role of the
Brāhmaṇa priest in later śrauta ritual: associated (secondarily) with the AV, he
silently observes the proceedings for errors and omissions. But that development
may be too late for even a late RVic hymn.</p>
