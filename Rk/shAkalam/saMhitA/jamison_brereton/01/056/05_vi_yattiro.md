When you spread out the immovable foundation [=earth], you  
set the airy realm on the doorposts of heaven with your lofty  
power.  
When, o Indra, in (the contest) with the sun as its prize, ecstatic in your  exhilaration with the excitement (of soma), you smashed VrÌ¥tra, (then)  you forced out the flood of waters.
