The first pāda is somewhat oddly expressed: Indra is urged to mount the horses yoked to the chariot, but not only is horseback riding very rare in the RV, but no one is likely to mount a horse being used to pull a vehicle. This must be an awkwardly expanded version of the usual “mount the chariot” (see 4c below).

The niyút- ‘team’ is generally associated with, indeed belongs to, Vāyu, who is regularly called niyútvant- ‘possessing niyúts’. However, the word is sometimes used in a reciprocal value: just as Vāyu and Indra drive to us with their niyúts, so do our niyúts, the ‘teams’ of poetic thoughts, drive in return to the gods, in passages where niyút- is parallel to words for ‘thought, hymn’, etc. Cf., e.g., I.134.2, 135.2, VI.35.3, 47.14, VII.23.4, 90.1, X.26.1. It is therefore not nec., with Bloomfield (RVReps ad loc.) to assume that “niyúto is for niyúdbhiḥ.”
