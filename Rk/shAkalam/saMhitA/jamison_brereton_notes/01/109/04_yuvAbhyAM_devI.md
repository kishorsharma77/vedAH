In the ritual actions depicted in pāda d, apsú most naturally goes with ā́ dhāvatam and mádhunā with pṛṅktám. Old insists that this must be the interpr., and all standard tr. follow him one way or the other. However, both the word order and, more importantly, the accent on pṛṅktám make that impossible, if we take the text seriously. The poet must have meant the ritual reversal.
