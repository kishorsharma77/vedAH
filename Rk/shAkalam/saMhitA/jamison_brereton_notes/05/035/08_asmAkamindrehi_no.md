The structure of ab mimics that of 7, which has (a) #asmā́kam … / (d) … avā rátham#, while 8 has (a) #asmā́kam … (b) #rátham avā .... Another verbal expression is inserted within this structure in pāda a: éhi naḥ. Ge tr. as two separate clauses, silently postponing the asmā́kam to the second one (“komm zu uns, begünstige unseren Wagen”). WG take éhi naḥ as an insertion: “Unserem -- Indra, komm her zu uns! -- (unserem) Wagen hilf …” This interpr. seems possible -- save for the position of the voc. indra, which is unaccented and precedes éhi naḥ so cannot belong to that phrase. (A slightly altered tr. would be “Ours, Indra -- come to us! -- (our) chariot …”) By contrast I take éhi … avā as a pseudo-serial verb construction (“come help”), though I admit that the naḥ might be problematic for that interpr.

Ge (/WG) take both diví as ‘today’, but outside of diví pāryé ‘on the decisive day’, a phrase characteristic primarily of VI and VII, diví always refers to heaven, as far as I can tell. ‘Heaven’ makes fine sense here, and cf. the similar expression
