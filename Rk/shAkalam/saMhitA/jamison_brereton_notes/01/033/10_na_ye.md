The rel. clauses with plural subj. in ab have no possible connection with anything in the second hemistich. I take them instead as completing the portrayal of the conflict between the two moieties depicted in the earlier parts of the hymn. The pl. rel. prn. yé has no direct antecedent in the preceeding pāda (9d), though it can pick up the intent of sg. dásyum; it can also hark a little further back to 9c ámanyamānān ‘heedless ones,’ as H-P Schmidt suggests (B+I).

If pādas ab close the preceding myth, the rest of the verse seems to allude glancingly to the Vṛtra (c) and Vala (d) myths.
