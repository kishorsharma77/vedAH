Indra
Pragātha Kāṇva
12 verses: paṅkti, except br̥hatī 7–9, arranged in trcas ̥
A pleasantly limpid praise of Indra, which emphasizes Indra’s pleasure in praise  and sacrifice (e.g., vss. 1, 4, 6) and the usual reciprocal benefits exchanged between  the god and his worshipers. The relationship between Indra and the sacrificers seems  to become stronger as the hymn progresses, its growth tracked through the word  “yoke.” In the early verses of the hymn Indra is isolated in his accomplishments: in  verse 2 he is said to be “without yokemate” and to accomplish his deeds alone; in  verse 3 he is about to win even with an unsatisfactory horse. But after he comes to  the sacrifice, the exchange relationship between worshiper and god comes to the  fore (vs. 5) and already in verse 6 the poet announces that Indra makes the soma offerer his partner and “yokemate.” By the penultimate verse (11) the poet himself,  in the first person, proposes that the god and the mortal “yoke ourselves together,”  to achieve the winnings Indra was on the point of winning alone in verse 3. The  poet somewhat hubristically claims that any enemy will yield to “us two,” implicitly  claiming a kind of equality between the man and the most powerful of gods.

The final verse, as often, is a summary, and it seems to establish the truth value  of the whole preceding hymn, as well as the précis given in the last half-verse. The  refrain found in every verse establishes the cheerful tone from the start.
