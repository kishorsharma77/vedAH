The first two pādas of this vs. are variously translated. The problems are 1) the referent of idám and 2) the absence of a verb. My interpr. is closest to Ge’s. If the referent of idám is the soma, we need only find a synonym for soma that is neuter; sávanam fits the bill and is elsewhere modified by sutá-, as it can be here. As for the verb, I assume a form of √as: the idiom ánu √as means ‘be at hand’.
