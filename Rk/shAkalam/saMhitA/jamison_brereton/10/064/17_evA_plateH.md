Hymns X.65–66 are attributed to a Vasukarṇa Vāsukra, who is otherwise unknown  in the R̥gveda. But his patronymic links him to Vasukra Aindra, poet of the fiend ishly challenging and immensely clever X.27–29, as well as another poet with  the same patronymic, namely Vasukr̥t Vāsukra, one possible author of X.20–26,  another set of well-crafted hymns. Moreover, the final verse of X.65 (15) and the  final two of X.66 (14–15) mention Vasiṣṭha and the Vasiṣṭhas, and both hymns end  with the Vasiṣṭha clan refrain familiar from Maṇḍala VII.
