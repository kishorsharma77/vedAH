That their name can be “broad/widespread like a flood” may at first seem odd, but the point is simply that it is widely known.

Pāda b expresses another common point about the Maruts: they do not have individual names (though see V.52.10-11), but “Marut” serves for each one of them.

I differ from Ge and Re in taking gen. pl. śáśvatām ‘of each and every one’ as referring to the Maruts, not to the mass of people; therefore in my view the subj. of the inf. bhujé is the Maruts, not these same unidentified people.

I do not know if pítrya- here refers specifically to the Maruts’ ancestors (esp., presumably, Rudra), as I have taken it, or whether this is a more general statement: “like ancestral life force” (so, more or less, Ge and Re).
