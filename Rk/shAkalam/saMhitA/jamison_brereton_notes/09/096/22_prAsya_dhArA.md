Given the play on names of meters in 18d, it’s quite possible that sā́man- is a technical term here.

Although eti has a goal in its pāda (at least in the simile) and should therefore be read as a lexical verb of motion, it may also be functioning as an auxiliary in a periphrasis krándann eti “keeps roaring,” which would be an analytic expression functionally equivalent to the “intensive” (that is, iterative-repetitive) kánikradat in 20d, 21b.
