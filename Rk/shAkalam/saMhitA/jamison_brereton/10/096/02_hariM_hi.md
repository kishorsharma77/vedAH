For those who have cried out together toward the golden womb are  the ones spurring on the two golden (horses) toward it as toward a  
heavenly seat.  
(To him) whom they fill with golden (soma drops) as milk-cows do  
with golden (drops of ghee)â€”to Indra chant a fortifying (hymn),  
accompanied by golden (soma).
