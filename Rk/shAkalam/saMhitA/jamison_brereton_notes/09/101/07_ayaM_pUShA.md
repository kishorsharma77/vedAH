bhū́man- generally means ‘earth’ (as opposed to heaven) or ‘world’. Here it seems a little outside its usual patch, as a metrical driven variant of the common phrase víśvasya bhúvanasya “of all creation”; see esp. IX.86.5 pátir víśvasya bhúvanasya rājasi matching our pátir víśvasya bhū́manaḥ, but also occurrences in I.164.21, II.27.4, 40.1, III.46.2, V.85.3, IX.86.28, 36, 97.56, X.45.6, 168.2, all but one straddling a late caesura, where the two light init. syllables of bhuvanasya fit well; bhúvanasya of course fits the cadence of no Vedic meter.
