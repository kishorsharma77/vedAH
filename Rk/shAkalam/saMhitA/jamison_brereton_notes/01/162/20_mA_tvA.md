The caus. redupl. aor. ā́tiṣṭhipat is tr. by most as ‘cause enduring pain’ vel sim., which is far from the lit. meaning of the lexeme. The caus. to ā́√sthā sometimes means ‘make stand still’, and I think that sense is in play here. The horse is about to go on a journey (apiyántam ‘going along’ in pāda a; more fully described in 21b), but various mishaps can keep that journey from happening and make the horse stop.
