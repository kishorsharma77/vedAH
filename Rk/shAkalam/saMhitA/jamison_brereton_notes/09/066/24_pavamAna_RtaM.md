With Lü (266), I take ṛtáṃ bṛhát as a nom. in apposition to Soma, rather than another acc. obj. to ajījanat as Ge/Re do. Either of course is possible; there are several passages in which an identification of Soma with ṛtá seems likely. See comm. ad IX.56.1.

But I would certainly accept an acc. interpr. as alternative.
