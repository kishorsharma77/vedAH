Agni
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra
10 verses: gāyatrī, except ekapadāvirāj 1, anuṣṭubh 2, virāj 9, triṣṭubh 10
This first of the Vimada hymns starts with a single-pāda verse adapted from the first  verse of X.25 and placed here to provide an auspicious beginning for the series. The  second verse has a similarly marked beginning: its first two words are identical to the  first words of the R̥gveda, I.1.1 agním īḷe “I invoke Agni....” The hymn mostly treats  the familiar topic of the physical presence of the ritual fire, though with some strik
ing imagery and turns of phrase. The fire’s expansion upward, even to heaven, is the subject of the middle verses (4–6), with his expansion opening the way also for mor tals and for gods. In the final summary verse (10) the poet Vimada names himself.
