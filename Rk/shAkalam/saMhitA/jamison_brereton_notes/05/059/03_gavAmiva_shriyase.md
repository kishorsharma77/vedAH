The various tr. configure these four similes somewhat differently; I won’t comment in detail on these versions. The most puzzling one is the first, in great part because it is not clear what the Maruts’ horn would be -- perhaps the superstructure of their helmets? or their lightning bolts? (Sāy. takes it as their turban.) Ge suggests that it has a double meaning, horn and Selbstgefühl, but we still need some physical aspect of the Maruts that could be compared to cowhorns, so the second abstract sense doesn’t help much.

Most interpr. take sū́ryo ná cákṣuḥ either as a mistake for gen. sū́raḥ (so Gr, e.g.) or as a decomposed bahuvrīhi, both yielding “like the eye of the sun.” I see no reason to adopt either interpr. The suggested phrase, with a proper gen., is found in 5d sū́ryasya cákṣuḥ (and, of course, elsewhere) in the same metrical position. If Śyāvāśva had wanted to say that here, he would have. Instead he must be comparing the Maruts’ eye to the sun, with both in the nom. Since sū́ryasya cákṣuḥ is a fairly common expression, its appearance in vs. 5 can be seen as poetic repair of the double nom. in our vs. In my view the quality held in common by sun and eye is the light emitted in the journey through space, but this depends on one’s interpr. of visárjane.

Ge gives it a later sense not otherwise found in the RV (Aufhören ‘stopping’, sim.

WG Schwinden); Re takes it as ‘expansion’. I see it as a variant of ví √sṛ ‘stream/run/spread through’. Cf. rájaso visāré I.79.1, used of Agni compared to the sun. In fact, we might consider the two phrases to be variants of each other; both are pāda final, with I.79.1 in a dimeter (hence iambic) cadence, while ours provides a Jagatī cadence.
