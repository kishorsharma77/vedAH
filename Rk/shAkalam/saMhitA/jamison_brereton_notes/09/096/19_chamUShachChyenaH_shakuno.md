I follow Ge in interpr. vibhṛ́tvan- as ‘spreading (wings)’, an interpr. that Old finds at least possible and that Re accepts. It is noteworthy - though I’m not sure where it gets us - that the Avestan Hom Yašt in Y. 9.14 contains the phrase vībǝrǝϑuuaṇtǝm āxtūirīm supposedly “with pauses and repeated four times,” describing the recitation of the Ahuna Vairiia prayer, with the equivalent of our vibhṛ́tvan- (/-vant-) and turī́ya-. But the contexts are so different that it is hard to know what, if anything, to make of it - though if there’s a covert reference to recitational styles here it would continue the technical poetic vocab. of 18d.

The stem govindú- ‘cow-finding’ is found only here in the RV and nowhere else in Skt. (though govinda- is of course quite common later). As Re notes, it is a play on índu- ‘drop’ and is immed. doubled by the synonym drapsá-.

The weapons of 16a (and 12d) return here.

I follow Lü (273) and Re in taking samudrám in c as part of a double acc. phrase with vivakti in d: “declares the sea to be the fourth domain” - rather than as taking it as a 2nd obj. with sácamānaḥ as Ge does (“… der Meerflut sich gesellend”).

Accepting Lü’s interpr. of the syntax does not, however, require accepting his view that this is the heavenly ocean, higher than heaven. Again, I think it’s a ritual ref. - perhaps to the waters that accompany him in pāda c.
