Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins (vss. 1–2) by implicitly contrasting Indra’s history, in the odd  pādas, with his current activity in the even ones. It continues with praise especially  of Indra’s martial powers (vss. 3–5). Verse 5 takes up the theme of Indra’s birth,  found in the first pāda of the hymn, but it is not entirely clear who the father and  mother are. In our opinion this is only a metaphorical reference to birth: Indra’s  vivification at the soma sacrifice, with the bull-father actually soma, referred to in  the immediately preceding pāda (4d). The identification of the mother is more dif
ficult in this interpretation: it could be a reference to the cow whose milk is mixed  with soma. A non-ritual reading of the verse is also possible, with the father and  mother the unnamed parents of Indra referred to elsewhere in the R̥gveda.
The second half of the hymn (vss. 6–10) describes the usual reciprocal relation  between worshiper and god:  anyone who gives the appropriate ritual devotion to  Indra will be appropriately rewarded (see esp. vss. 6, 8). Yet the poet is not entirely  sure Indra is doing his part, and in verse 7 he rather saucily (and even slangily) con
trasts the proper patron–client behavior among humans with Indra’s failure to come  through. The poet also treats himself somewhat mockingly: in verse 9 he compares his  praise first to a bellowing bull and then—in our view (the relevant word is a disputed  hapax)—to another animal with a wailing or screeching cry, perhaps a monkey. But  these light moments give way to the usual pleas for benefits at the end of the hymn.
