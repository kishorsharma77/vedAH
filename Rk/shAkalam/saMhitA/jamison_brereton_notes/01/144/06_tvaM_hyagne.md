Opinion is divided over whether the two females of cd are Heaven and Earth or Night and Dawn. On the one hand, the heavenly and earthly realms of ab seem to favor the former pair; on the other, Heaven and Earth are not easily movable and would find it difficult to come physically to the ritual ground. (On this issue see Jamison, Staal Mem. Vol., 2016].) Night and Dawn might make better sense, in that the kindling of the ritual fire occurs at their temporal intersection and so they might appear to be both present at that moment. For such a sentiment see I.146.3. vákvarī ‘surging, undulating’ is also a more likely epithet of Night and Dawn (with their changing light) than of Heaven and Earth. Remember Agni’s beams churning “like the rivers of the night” in the immed. preceding hymn I.143.3.
