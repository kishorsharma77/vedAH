Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
4 verses: uṣṇih
A simple hymn, in which the refrain (pāda c of each verse) offers Indra soma to  drink, and the first half of each verse consists of a definitional relative clause refer ring to Indra’s deeds in his soma-exhilaration. As often, the pattern set in the rest  of the hymn is modified but not entirely broken in the final verse: verses 1–3 contain  the syntagm yásya...máda- “(in) whose exhilaration,” while the final verse substi tutes the participle mandāná “finding exhilaration” for the etymologically related  noun máda, and also inserts a part of the soma plant, its stalk, on which the relative  pronoun is dependent.
