Note the opening phonetic figure ā́gnā́agna.

The shadowy goddess figures mentioned here are difficult to sort out. I assume that there are three goddesses here, with Hotrā Bhāratī the double name of the deified libation belonging to the Bharatas. In this passage Ge takes them as two different figures (also in II.1.11, III.62.3), but in I.142.9 as a doubly named single figure. See Old (SBE, ad I.142.9): “Hotrâ Bhâratî, i.e., the personified Offering of the Bharatas, seems to be one goddess, more usually called simply Bhâratî,” with reff.
