Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Again this hymn expresses a martial and competitive spirit, especially in verse  2. Also, as in VII.28, another god is introduced into an Indra hymn, this time Agni  (vs. 3), rather than Varuṇa (VII.28.4). The combination of Agni and the dawns sug gests a dawn sacrifice, and the praise of patrons in verse 4 must refer to the distribu tion of the dakṣiṇā or priestly gift by patrons to priests and poets at that ceremony.
