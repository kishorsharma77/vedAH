This vs. contains a faint phonological figure: #ví ṣ(āhi) … #víś(vebhir).

With most interpr. I take khám ‘opening, aperture’ with pāda a. However, I do not think it is equivalent to or compared with manīṣā́m ‘inspiration, inspired thought’ (as, e.g., Ge “Schliesse … den … Gedanken (wie) einen Kanal auf”), but rather it is the opening through which (ví) the thought is supposed to be directed. As we all know, sending a stream of liquid (to which the manīṣā́- is implicitly compared) through a small opening increases its force, and I think that is the image meant.

Both hemistichs express a fine economical formulation of the tight, closed loop of reciprocity envisioned in the RV. Agni and the rest of the gods desire praise from men, but they must provide to men the inspiration and the thought that takes shape as praise. So in ab Agni is asked to release the manīṣā́to us even as he is being praised (stávānaḥ), and in cd we ask him to grant us ample thought (bhū́ri mánma), which is exactly what he and the other gods crave (vāvánaḥ).
