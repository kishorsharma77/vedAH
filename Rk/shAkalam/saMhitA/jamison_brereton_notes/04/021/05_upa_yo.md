I take ṛñjasāná- to be built to the anomalous 1st sg. middle ṛñjase (for which see comm. ad IV.8.1), pace Jasanoff 2016 (etc.), based in part on the shared constr.

ṛñjas- GOD (acc.) HYMN (instr.) exemplified, e.g., by IV.8.1 yájiṣṭham ṛñjase girā́“I aim towards the best sacrificer with a song” (cf. VI.15.1) and our ṛñjasānáḥ … uktháiḥ … índram “aiming straight at Indra with hymns.” (In fact I would now favor slightly changing the text of the publ. tr. to “aiming straight with his hymns” rather than translating ukthaíḥ with the following pāda as in the publ. tr.) The creation and maintenance of the stem ṛñjasāná- is supported by the other -asāná- secondary participles, on which see comm. ad IV.3.6.
