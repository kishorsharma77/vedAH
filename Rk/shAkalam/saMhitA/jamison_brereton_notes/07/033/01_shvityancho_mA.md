By most accounts this vs. is spoken by Indra, who is the referent of the 1st ps. enclitics mā and me in pādas a and d and the subj. of 1st ps. voce in c.

As noted already ad VII.18.21, Ge has a peculiar interpr. of the verbal lexeme (abhí) prá √mad as ‘go on a pilgrimage’, for which there is no support that I can see.

Old also rejects this interpr. I follow Old’s view that Indra is present at a competing sacrifice -- a constant preoccupation of the Indra hymns of VII -- and recalling the Vasiṣṭhas’ ritual service to him, he gets up to the leave the sacrifice where he is present to go to theirs. Pāda d is the embedded self-quotation of Indra, providing the reason for his departure for the Vasiṣṭhas.

The descriptors of the Vasiṣṭhas śvityáñcaḥ … dakṣiṇatáskapardāḥ are found almost identically in VII.83.8 śvityáñcaḥ … kapardínaḥ, where they modify the Tṛtsus, Sudās’s fighting force in the Ten Kings Battle, in a hymn much concerned with that battle. Vasiṣṭha was at least an adoptive member of the Tṛtsu clan. See Ge’s n. 1a and esp. vss. 5, 6, and 15 in this hymn.

Despite the position of the generally sentential, Wackernagel’s Law particle hí far to the right in b, the verb complex abhí hí pramandúḥ must have domain over the entire hemistich, with mā in 2nd pos. in pāda a serving as its object. As often, when a preverb stays with its verb at the end of a clause rather than moving to the front of its clause, hí is inserted, between preverb and verb (or here preverb1 and preverb 2 verb).
