In the cmpd. grāmajít- the 1st member could have either an acc. or an instr.

relationship with the root noun. Both would be possible: ‘conquering roving band’ (so Gr, Ge, Re, Thieme [M+A 81]) or ‘conquering with/in roving bands’. Although in such root noun cmpds an acc. relationship is more common, indeed also among cmpds in -jít-, I follow Scarlatta’s preferred interpr. (156) found also in his tr. (=WG), although the acc. interpr. is hardly excluded. The parallel I.100.10 grā́mebhiḥ sánitā, cited by Re, is suggestive.

My interpr. of b follows Thieme (M+A 81), esp. of aryamáṇaḥ, which he takes as “hospitable ones (hospitable householders who refresh the stranger).” Others take it as a pregnant pl. referring to “(Mitra, Varuṇa, and) Aryaman.” The dep. cl. in c, yád inā́so ásvaran, can be construed either with what precedes or what follows, but sits uneasily with either because of its augmented ásvaran, which doesn’t match the pres. indic. pínvanti (c) or undanti (d). I chose to connect it with d, as thunder before rain.
