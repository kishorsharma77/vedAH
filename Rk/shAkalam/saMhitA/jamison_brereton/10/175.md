Pressing Stones
Ūrdhvagrāvan Āṅgirasa
4 verses: gāyatrī
This third hymn to the pressing stones (the others being X.76 and X.94) has none  of the rhetorical ambition or vividness of the other two. It begins and ends (vss. 1,4) with an appeal to the god Savitar, literally “the Impeller,” to provide the impul sion to set the stones to pressing.
## 1
Let god Savitar propel you forth according to his ordinance, o pressing  stones.
Yoke yourselves to the chariot-poles. Press!
## 2
O pressing stones, ward off misfortune, off ill-will.
Make the ruddy ones [=soma plants] into a remedy.
## 3
The pressing stones joined in fellowship display their greatness on the  lower (stones),
providing bullish power to the bull.
## 4
O pressing stones, let god Savitar now propel you according to ordinance for the sacrificer who presses (soma).
