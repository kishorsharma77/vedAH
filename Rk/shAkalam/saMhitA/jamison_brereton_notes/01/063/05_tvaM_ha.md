This verse contains many small problems of interpretation that hinder putting together the whole. I’ll start with the details and turn to the construction of the whole thereafter.

áriṣaṇyan is universally taken as intrans., patient-oriented ‘not receiving harm, not being harmed’, but in all cases this stem is better taken as ‘not allowing harm’.

The finite verb riṣaṇyáti also has this meaning “intends harm, allows harm’. The parallel stem áriṣaṇya- in II.29.4 has the same meaning and takes a genitive (áriṣaṇyā tanū́nām “not allowing harm to our bodies”), and I construe the gen. mártānām in b with áriṣyan: “not intending harm to mortals.” The next problem is dṛḷhásya. Ge takes this as the causer of the harm to Indra (gen. agent), while Hoffmann, followed by WG, construe it with ájuṣṭau, with the gen. pl. mártānām dependent on dṛḷhásya (KH “bei Missfallen selbst eines Feststehenden unter den Sterblichen”), but both the Ge and the WG interpretations require that dṛḷhá- be a person. This is unprecedented: this past participle is virtually always used of a place, a fortified stronghold. Indra is once (VIII.44.12) called dṛḷhá-, presumably because he is as steadfast as a fortress (in the vein of “a mighty fortress is our god”), but I know of no examples with people so called. If at all possible it should have the standard meaning here. I think this is possible, by reading the verb ví … var of pāda c also with the first hemistich and supplying the word dúraḥ ‘doors’.

In fact, the other two passages containing the gen. sg. dṛḷhásya strongly support this solution, as they both contain the verb ví √vṛ and the headnoun dúraḥ: VI.62.11 drḷ̥hásya cid gómato ví vrajásya, dúro vartam ... “Open the doors of the cattle pen, even though it is shut fast” and VII.79.4 ví dr̥ḷhásya dúro ádrer aurṇoḥ “you opened up the doors of the firm-fixed stone.” Note that ví … var is rather more appropriate to this hemistich than it is to the pāda in which it’s found. (Recall the double use of ví √var in I.62.5 and 7.) The last word to be accounted for in this hemistich is ájuṣṭau. Unlike most tr.

I take it to be Indra’s displeasure. The object of his displeasure is not expressed, but it is easy to supply — presumably Vala, since Indra is opening up his stronghold. His displeasure at Vala (or other demonic enemies) is implicitly contrasted with his benevolent care not to injure mortals.

I am less sure about what pāda c is conveying. I assume this is a racing image: Indra starts the race by opening the barriers at the starting line. Ge and Re take the injunctive ví … var as a functional imperative, but this is certainly not necessary. I tr.

as a past tense, in keeping with its rendering in the first hemistich, but it would be possible to take it as a present in c, as Hoffman/WG do. The phrase asmád ā́ “(coming) from us” seems a bit heavy simply to express that it’s our horse, so there may be some racing terminology embedded here.

In d ghanéva contains the old instr. ghanā́. The same phrase is found in
