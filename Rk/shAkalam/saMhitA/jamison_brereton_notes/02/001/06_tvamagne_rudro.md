I do not understand the cmpd śaṃgayá-. Wackernagel (AIG II.1.309) classifies it with cmpds with governing first-member prepositions, but śám, though uninflected, does not function like even the improper prepositions/preverbs like áram. He does recognize its singularity (314-15), but keeps it in this category, in which it seems out of place.
