By my interpr. (and Ge’s) śíkṣan is a predicated pres. participle, parallel to the subjunctive áyat in the 2nd clause; it seems to have adopted the modal sense of this parallel finite verb.

Note the play between the two initial words of pādas a and b: yád and áyad (áyaj in sandhi), where the second is actually a subjunctive to the root present of √i ‘go’.

The question in c is not overtly marked, but I follow both Old and Ge in taking it as such. 21
