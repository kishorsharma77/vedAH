      <description>This translation exists because of Patrick Olivelle, who, some fifteen years ago or so at the annual meeting of the American Oriental Society in New Orleans in 1998, approached the two of us with a proposition: that we should undertake a quick translation of the R̥ gveda for a general audience. Patrick’s persuasive powers are well known, and we were intrigued and easily persuaded. Although the “quick” element of the proposition was not exactly fulfilled, we wish to thank Patrick abun- dantly for starting us on this path, which has provided both of us with the most sustained and satisfying intellectual experience of our lives, and for his constant encouragement and sage advice along the way.</description>

      <description>India has a magnificent tradition of religious literature stretching over three and a half millennia, with a vast range of styles and subjects—from almost impersonal reflections on the mysteries of the cosmos, the divine, and humankind’s relation to them to deeply intimate expressions of worship. This literature is justly cele brated, not only within the religious traditions that gave rise to the various works but around the world among people with no ties to those religious traditions.</description>
