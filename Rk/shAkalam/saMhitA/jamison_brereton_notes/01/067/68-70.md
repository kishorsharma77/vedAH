Agni I consider these three hymns to be thematically and verbally linked, treating the Vaiśvānara fire and encoding this theme by deploying the two words underlying this vṛddhi compound, víśva- and nṛ́-. The first, víśva-, dominates I.68, the second, nṛ́- I.69, and they are juxtaposed in the climactic verses of I.70.9-10. See the introductions to the three hymns in the publ. tr., and for a detailed discussion, Jamison, Fs. J. S. Klein (“Inter-hymnic Rhetorical Structure in Ṛgveda I.68-70: Parāśara Śāktya’s Vaiśvānara Cycle,” 2016).
