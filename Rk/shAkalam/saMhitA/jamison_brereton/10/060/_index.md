Asamāti (1–4, 6), Indra (5), Spell to Heal Subandhu  (7–11), Praise of the Hand (12)  
The four Gaupāyanas or Laupāyanas (as for X.57)  
12 verses: anuṣṭubh 1–5, anuṣṭubh 6–7, paṅkti 8–9, anuṣṭubh 10–12  
Another hymn that invites decomposition. The first six verses are a sort of praśasti  or royal encomium of Asamāti; indeed, the first four form a single sentence. There  

is no obvious connection to the themes of healing and restoration to life found in  the other Gaupāyana hymns, and one can see how the lack of thematic integration  invited the explanatory itihāsa (see introduction to X.57) that provides a tale relat ing King Asamāti to the suffering Subandhu.  
The second part of the hymn (vss. 7–12) is a spell to heal Subandhu and restore  his mind. It first recalls him to life (vs. 7), then provides models from the constructed  and natural worlds (vss. 8 and 9 respectively) for securing Subandhu’s mind within  him. The return of his mind is announced in verse 10, while his sickness is banished  in verse 11, again with models from the natural world. Finally the healing hand is  praised in verse 12. Thus, this final segment of the Gaupāyana collection returns us  to the first two hymns, X.57–58, and their concentration on the return of the mind  of a sick person. Note especially that the first verse of X.58, which envisions the  departure of his mind to Yama Vaivasvata in the realm of the dead, is triumphantly  completed here by verse 10, “I have brought the mind of Subandhu here from Yama  Vaivasvata.”
