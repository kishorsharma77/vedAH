Soma and Pūsaṇ
Gr̥tsamada
6 verses: triṣṭubh
Soma and Pūṣan are addressed jointly in just this one hymn, and it is difficult to see  what brings them together here. The last three verses of this six-verse hymn contrast  their functions; in the first three they act jointly, but these actions are not particu larly characteristic of either of the two.
