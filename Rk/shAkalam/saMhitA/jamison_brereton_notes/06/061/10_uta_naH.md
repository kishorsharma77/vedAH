On tṛca-introducing utá see ad 7 above.

We might expect the splv. priyátamā in this construction.

I don’t exactly know how to interpr. the VP stómyā bhūt, with injunc. aor. of √bhū (or indic. aor? the Saṃhitā sequence stómyābhūt could contain augmented abhūt) and the pseudo-gerundive stómya-. The same construction is found in vs. 12 hávyā bhūt (or hávyā *abhūt). In vs. 12 Hoffmann (140) takes it as iterative, presumably because of the āmreḍita vā́je-vāje: “'ist bei jedem Preiskampf anzurufen.” But √bhū is a change-of-state verb and the aorist should (in a wellbehaved language) be punctual. In both vss. the standing characteristics of Saravatī are being described, so she should not have “become one worthy to be praised/invoked,” because the just-mentioned characteristics are not new. We might speculate that, because there's no injunctive of √as, in order to express a nontemporally marked copula (as opposed to a nominal sentence with suppressed copula) you have to turn to √bhū and the aorist injunctive. But this seems like a long shot. Ge and Re take it as modal: “… sei … preisenswert”; “soit apte à (recevoir) … la louange” (though Re remarks “bhūt au sens d’abhūt,” without recognizing that the Saṃhitā text could in fact contain abhūt). Note that vs. 13 (which is not part of this tṛca) contains a predicated pseudo-gerundive in the same semantic sphere, upastútyā ‘to be praised’, without aux.
