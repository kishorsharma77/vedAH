Agni  
Gr̥tsamada  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
This last hymn in the brief Gr̥tsamada Agni cycle is defined by a ring: the first word  (johū́traḥ “invoked on every side”) is echoed by the last word (johavīmi “I constantly  invoke”), and there are a number of word plays throughout the hymn. The hymn’s  structure defines as an omphalos verse 3, especially the second half, which contains  the opaque hapax śíriṇāyām, here tentatively rendered as “(birth-)canal.” Verse 3,  the mysterious center of the poem, describes the creation of fire in terms of human  conception and birth and expresses the paradox that such a powerful force can  be invisibly confined in the inert wood. The last verse (6) contains a pun, “with  a tongue seeking speech,” applicable to both Agni and the poet: for Agni it is the  flame as tongue, seeking the poet’s praise hymn; for the poet, it is his own tongue,  seeking efficacious wording for the same hymn.
