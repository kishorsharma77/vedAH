The fem. sg. loc. uttānā́yām is generally simply tr. ‘outstretched’ or sim. I think the image is more precise: the two kindling sticks, athwart each other, are likened to a woman in birthing position with her legs stretched out and open (my “agape”).

The rhyming form śíriṇāyāṃ opening the 2nd half-vs. is much more difficult.

It is a hapax with no clear root affiliation, and the suggested tr. range widely -- ‘night’, ‘chamber’, ‘hiding place’, etc. (See the standard tr., plus KEWA and EWA s.v.) My own very tentative suggestion links it to sirā ‘stream’ (I.121.11) and sirī́- (if that means ‘stream’, as JPB takes it, X.71.9), as well as to later sirā- ‘vein’ (also found in MIA). By extension I take it to refer metaphorically to the birth canal, in which Agni remains, unborn, during the night -- though he cannot be kept confined for very long. This would again be a reference to the kindling sticks, in whose attenuated interior he is fancied to be hidden. The variation in sibilant would not be surprising, particularly in a body-part word that could be mediated by Middle Indic.

All this is very speculative, however, and it might be wiser to leave the word untranslated.
