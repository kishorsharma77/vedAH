In my opinion the same switch in number happens in this vs. as in the preceding one, exactly in the same way -- with yé in c picking up gaṇám in the first hemistich. The standard tr. take the rel. cl. of c with d: the pl. yé matches the number of its putative antecedent nṝ́n in d exactly. Although connecting with c thus appears to be the easier syntactic course, the exact parallelism between 1abc and 2abc makes that structure more appealing, and in addition the pāda-init. impv. vándasva in d seems to be marking a syntactic break.

The first hemistich, which consists entirely of an acc. phrase, obviously simply continues vs. 1, skipping back over the rel. cl. in 1cd to the gaṇám phrase in 1ab.

The bv dhúni-vrata- ‘possessing a turbulent commandment’ has, at first glance, a curious sense, but the point is that, as the thunderstorm, the Maruts’ job -- their vratá -- is to be noisy, boisterous, and tumultuous.

The orig. s-stem máyas- has become a frozen, synchronically uninflected form in the RV. Therefore, the accent shift that makes possessive adjectives out of many neut. s-stems (type yáśas- ‘glory’ à yaśás- ‘glorious’) was probably not an available derivational strategy -- hence the somewhat clumsy cmpd with bhū́-.

The phrase mayo(-bhúvaḥ) … ámitāḥ appears to be an etymological play but of course is not.

It’s worthy of note that the vs. contains 3 nominal forms with 1st member ending in -i, all with different explanations: dhúni-vrata- (a regular -i-stem; AiG II.2.296), the mysteriously formed (at least to me) dā́ti-vāra-, and tuvi-rā́dhas- (Caland compounding -i-). To which we might add mahitvā́and the immediately preceding ámitā(ḥ) with mirror-image phonology.
