Most take kīstá- in pāda as a PN, a further specification of the Bhṛgus, and this is a tempting way to avoid dealing with the word. However, it is more difficult to take it as a PN in its only other appearance in the RV (and indeed anywhere) at VI.67.10. I therefore follow the interpr. going back at least to Sāy, ‘praiser’. EWA has a reasonably plausible scenario for getting it as a hypersanskritization of a MIA form of *kīrtha-, beside kīrtí- ‘praise’, etc.

I take mathnántaḥ in c as a pun on √math ‘steal’ (referring to the Bhṛgus’ theft of fire; see Narten, KlSch. 23-24) and ‘churn, rub’, a common word for the production of the fire on the ritual ground.

The identity of the “dear coverings” is not clear. Ge suggest, for example, that they are what keep Agni within the kindling sticks, WG that they are everything a fire burning in a field would incorporate in itself. Since Agni is identified as the holder (dharṇí-) of goods in e, I wonder if the coverings are the enclosure itself -- though what this means physically I’m not sure.

On the isolated precative vaniṣīṣṭa see Narten (SigAor. 236-37), who points out that its object is also a hapax and considers it an “Augenblicksbildung des Dichters.” The “wise one” (médhira-) is probably Agni himself, as often, and the med. form of the verb would support this identification.
