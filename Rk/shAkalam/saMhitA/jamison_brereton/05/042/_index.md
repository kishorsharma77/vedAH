All Gods  
Atri Bhauma  
18 verses: triṣṭubh, except ekapadā virāj 17  
Like the last hymn, this one enumerates a number of different gods to whom we  direct our praise, beginning, as V.41 did, with Mitra and Varuṇa, and the concern,  as in that hymn, is generally the ritual exchange of mortal praise for immortal gifts.  Or such is the structure of the opening (vss. 1–6) and concluding (vss. 11–18) sec  
tions of the hymn. In the middle (vss. 7–10) Br̥haspati (in vs. 10 with the Maruts)  is called upon to be generous to generous patrons but to unleash destructive power  against stingy patrons and non-sacrificers. As Hanns-Peter Schmidt has noted,  these hostile actions are uncharacteristic of Br̥haspati but typical of Indra, just  as the association of Indra with the sacred formulation in verse 4 would be more  expected of Br̥haspati than Indra. He therefore argues (1968:  84–86) that verses  4–10 form a unity in this hymn, with Br̥haspati serving as an epithet of Indra.  
Although the gods in the enumerative verses are often named, some verses  are riddles, describing the god without naming him (1cd, 6, 13, 14) or naming  him only in the second half of the verse (3, 11). Such puzzles are common in All  God hymns.  
At the end of the hymn (vss. 14–17) the poet expresses the hope that his praise  should reach in all directions, to all three worlds, creating wide space for him and  his companions (in the final single-pāda verse 17). (Verse 18 is adopted from Aśvin  hymns later in the maṇḍala [V.76.5, 77.5], perhaps to introduce the Aśvins, who are  otherwise unmentioned, into this All God hymn.)
