Indra This hymn nicely demonstrates the distribution of impv. forms to √bhū that I discussed in my 1997 “Syntactic constraints on morphological change: The Vedic imperatives bodhi, dehi, and dhehi”: bháva/bhava is found initial (3d) or final (10d, 11a) in its pāda or clause, while bodhi is internal (4c).
