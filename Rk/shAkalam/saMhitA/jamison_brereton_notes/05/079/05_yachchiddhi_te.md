The two-party sketch in vs. 4 gives way to a three-party model: when Dawn gives them the go-ahead, as it were, the patrons, who have not yet been mentioned in the hymn as a class, bestow bounties on the poets.

This vs. presents some difficulties, not least the referent(s) of the various plurals and their grammatical identity. With most, I take the gaṇā́ḥ to be the priest/poets who were also the subj. of the preceding vs. and who greeted Dawn with praise in 4ab. The first hemistich of this vs. expresses the potential reciprocity for this praise: Dawn considers its producers worthy to be given bounties, the same bounties referred to in 5c.

I part company with the standard tr. in the 2nd hemistich. Most take the subj.

here to be the patrons, who either physically surround the priest/poets (so I read Old) while giving to them or have succeeded (using a sense of pári √dhā [‘conclude’ not found till later]) in giving, finished giving to them (Ge, Re, WG). By contrast I consider the subject still to be the priest/poets. They surround the patrons, who are giving to them. dádataḥ is of course grammatically ambiguous: I take it as acc. pl., while the rest interpr. it as nom. pl. The use of the word gaṇá- ‘throng’ to refer to the poets in ab helps explain the surprisingly physical verb ‘surround’ in cd: the picture is of the over-eager (váṣṭi-) ritual recipients almost ganging up on the patrons.
