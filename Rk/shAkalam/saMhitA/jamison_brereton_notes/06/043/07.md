The medial pf. part. papāná- is one of only 3 forms of the middle pf. in the RV, 2 of which, incl. this one, are used passively. See Kü (309). Note that a deriv. of the other root √pā ‘protect’, pāyúḥ, is found in the 2nd hemistich.

The vs. is notable for a number of hapaxes: acait, staulā́-, and dhautárī, the latter two also marked by vṛddhi.

On acait as a nonce s-aor. to √cit ‘perceive’, see Narten (114).

staulā́- here is reminiscent of the likewise impenetrable stauná- in this same maṇḍala VI.66.5. No remotely credible guesses have been proposed for these forms, or for dhautárī-; Ge (n. 7c): “ganz dunkel” and he fails to tr. the NP; Old: “Über staulā́bhir dhautárībhiḥ scheint kein Ergebnis erreichbar”; EWA (II.762 and I.783) also throws up its hands. I am inclined to connect staulā́- and stauná- with similar words but with aspirated initial sth-, namely sthūrá- ‘brawny, sturdy’ and sthū́ṇā- ‘post’ (see comm. ad VI.66.5) respectively, but I cannot explain the phonological discrepancy.

As for dhautárī-, Old tentatively suggests that it might belong with one of the roots √dhāv ‘run’ or ‘rinse’. For translational convenience I have assumed the former, but without any conviction. In any case the striking double vṛddhi -au- of these paired nominals must be meant to draw attention to the phrase.
