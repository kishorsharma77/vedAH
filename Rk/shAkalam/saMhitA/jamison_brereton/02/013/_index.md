Indra
Gr̥tsamada
13 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 13
The opening verses of this hymn leave the subject often unstated and often unclear  in part because, as in the preceding hymns, there is often a double reference to ritual  acts and either mythical or natural events. Thus, while details remain uncertain,

the first verses describe the soma sacrifice, seen as a creation of Indra. This ritual  context is established in verse 1, in which the subject is likely the soma or the soma  plant. The birth of the soma plant occurs in its proper time of year, and therefore its  mother is the r̥tú, its “season.” However, the soma is also born at the proper ritual  moment, and therefore its mother is also r̥tú, which can also refer to the “ritual  sequence.” Then in verse 2, again without naming him, the poet introduces Indra— or apparently does so—through associating Indra’s release of the waters with the  flowing, soma-bearing waters of the rite.
Verses 3–4 describe the acts of the ritual, although in 4b, the identity of several  of the actors is not certain. The one “who comes” could be soma or Indra or even  the fire (as Geldner suggests with a different interpretation of the ellipsis). The poet  turns to Indra’s heroic deeds in verse 5—although the waters which he released  connect these deeds to the ritual—and then in verse 6, to an explicit description of  Indra’s ritual acts. Verse 7 poses a number of interpretive difficulties, but in pāda a,  the “flowering and fruitful” might be plants generally or the soma plants; in pāda b,  the streams might be waters or specifically ritual waters; and in pāda d, the ūrvá, the  “containers,” might refer to the oceans as containers of water in a cosmic register  or the containers of soma in a ritual one.
Verses 8–12 mention other of Indra’s deeds. In verse 9 Geldner suggests that  Indra bound his enemies by a magically induced sleep and thus by that “which has  no ropes.” See also II.15.9, where Indra conquers his enemies by putting them to  sleep. Verse 12, returning to the conjunction of heroic and ritual deed and to the  theme of rivers and waters, may speak not (or not only) of Indra’s rescue of a per
son who was blind and lame, but of Indra’s role in producing the soma hidden in  the plant before it is pressed out (cf. II.15.7).
