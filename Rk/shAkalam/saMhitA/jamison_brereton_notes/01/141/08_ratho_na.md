What quality of a chariot is expressed by the ppl. yātá- to √yā ‘drive’ is unclear. Because of the phrase “made by dexterous (men),” which seems to refer to the chariot as object rather than to its current situation, I suggest that it’s a particular type of chariot, perhaps one made for long journeys. But it is also possible that it refers to the current situation, in which case it could mean “like a driven chariot” (i.e., one that is speeding).

Pāda c is full of difficulties, esp. the unaccented dakṣi and the semantically anomalous sūráyaḥ ‘patrons’. There is also the question whether the pāda is syntactically independent or forms a clause with d. With Ge (but contra most other interpr.) I take cd together. Otherwise pāda c would be a nominal clause of some sort, but the introductory ā́d (recalling ā́d íd of 5a, 6a) seems to call for a dynamic verb.

As for the “black patrons” I take this to be, as it were, a two-part phrase: “black” first refers to the plumes of smoke, picking up kṛṣṇájaṃhas- ‘having black plumage’ in 7c; the clouds of smoke surrounding the fire are then implicitly likened to the sacrificial patrons who would gather around the ritual fire.

What then to do with dakṣi? Two main solutions are found in the lit.: it is a 2nd sg. impv. (or si-imperative) to √dah ‘burn’ as it is in II.1.10 (Re), or it is a voc. of a nominal stem of unclear formation likewise built to √dah (Old, WG). Ge refuses to tr.

and AiG II.1.408 floats both possibilities. The first (impv.) has the merit of matching an actual existing form, but otherwise has little to recommend it. In particular, if it forms a parenthetical independent clause it should be accented. The second (voc.) does not create syntactic problems but leaves the question of the morphology unresolved. I do not favor either of them, because either one requires 2nd ps.

reference, which I think would violate the structure of the hymn. As noted in the publ.

intro., the first 8 verses are couched entirely in the 3rd person describing the fire and entirely lack the word agní-; both the 2nd ps. and agní- are forcefully introduced at the beginning of vs. 9 (tváyā hy àgne), and this 2nd ps. address prevails in the next three vss. (9-11). I find it difficult to believe that the wily Dīrghatamas would spoil his schematic division by introducing a muddled 2nd person in vs. 8. Moreover, the asya in 8c surely has Agni as its referent, which should probably preclude a 2nd ps.

reference to him in the same pāda. Unfortunately I do not have an acceptable solution to dakṣi, however. With the others I take it as an unclearly formed nominal derivative of √dah, but as the 1st member of a tatpuruṣa with sūrí-, hence ‘the patron(s) of the burning one’, but this is a solution of desperation and carries no conviction.

The grammar of d is scarcely less contorted than that of c. The verb īṣate belongs to a clear thematic stem and should therefore of course be 3rd sg., but the apparent subject, váyaḥ, is ordinarily a nom. pl. ‘birds’ to the stem ví-. To make the grammar work, it needs to be interpreted as a neut. s-stem collective in the nom. sg.

(‘bird flesh, poultry’; cf. Re’s ‘la gent-ailée’), a formation that is found later (already AV) but not otherwise in the RV. Moreover, if pāda c is to be construed with d, its pl.

subj. kṛṣṇā́saḥ … sūráyaḥ also clashes in number with the verb īṣate. My somewhat uneasy solution to this is to assume that váyaḥ here has been reinterpreted as a singular collective and, as the noun closest to the verb, has determined the number of the verb. But since váyaḥ refers to the collectivity of birds, the pl. kṛṣṇā́saḥ … sūráyaḥ can match it in sense and therefore function as subj. of īṣate as well.

(Another possible solution is to assume that īṣate has been assimilated to the athematic formations of similar shape, ī́rte, ī́rate and, esp., the near rhyme ī́ṣṭe, ī́śate, with 3rd plural in -ate. This does not seem impossible to me, esp. since their 1st sgs. in

-e would coincide.)
The publ. tr. reflects a double reading of initial śū́rasya ‘of a champion’ with partial emendation to *sū́ryasya / sū́raḥ ‘of the sun’ in its 2nd reading. In my view, the juxtaposition across pāda boundary of sūráyaḥ and śū́rasya was designed to bring to mind a third term, the sun, sharing its initial with sūráyah, its gen. case with śū́rasya, and its -ūr- with both. Though the patrons might shrink from the attack of a champion, birds are more likely to shrink from the flaring of the sun, either retreating from its heat or avoiding flying too high and therefore too near it. This double reading helps unify the two-part NP of c, the black (plumes) = patrons, and takes us back to the flight of the bird Agni in 7cd.
