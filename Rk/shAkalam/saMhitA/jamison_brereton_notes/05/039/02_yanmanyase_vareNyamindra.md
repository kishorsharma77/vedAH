Although this vs. is lexically and syntactically quite distinct from V.38.2, they seem to share a thematic core. First, note that váreṇi yam at the end of pāda a is positioned identically to śravā́yi yam in 38a, with the same type of formation and roughly the same meaning, and both are introduced by yád ‘which’ at the beginning of their pādas. Here the adj. clearly designates some good thing that Indra should bring us; recall that śravā́yi ya- also usually refers to wealth of some sort. In the second half-verse Indra’s limitless capacity for giving is expressed in a vivid image -

- Indra as unbounded ocean -- while in 38.2cd the unidentified praiseworthy thing
spreads itself out longest, also an image of unbounded expanse. The means of expressing the concept are quite different, but the concept itself seems the same.
