On mitá-jñu- see comm. ad VI.32.3.

The sákhibhyaḥ of the final pāda must be Sarasvatī’s sister rivers. As Old points out, the stem sákhi- can be used of females as well as males; fem. sákhī- is absent from the older language. See also Re ad loc. For the glorification of Sarasvatī over the other rivers, see vs. 1 and implicitly vs. 2, as well as the 1st vs. of the next hymn (VII.96.1) and VI.61.9, 10, 13. The formulation “higher than ABL” is identical to the boast of the victorious co-wife in X.145.3 úttarāhám … úttaréd úttarābhyaḥ “I am higher, higher even than the higher ones (fem.).”
