The publ. tr. seems to suggest an etymological relationship between “earthly realm” and “Earth,” but in fact they are lexically distinct: kṣā́ma and pṛthivī́, though adjacent.

The list of strengtheners in ab is oddly assorted, but up till the last term they are all divinities or (pṛthivī́) capable of being so configured; I therefore don’t understand the presence of the “five peoples” (páñca jánāḥ), who are humans. Ge’s ref. to X.53.4 is no help (at least to me).

Both Ge and Re take the injunc. vardhan as modal “may they / let them strengthen.” Certainly the impv. bhávantu in the 2nd hemistich would support this interpr., but in general modal readings of injunctives are rather rare.

The 2nd hemistich contains 5 cmpds with su- as first member, all but the last bahuvrīhis, as Re points out. The odd-man-out is sugopā́ḥ ‘good herdmen’. All 5 have accent on the 2nd member.
