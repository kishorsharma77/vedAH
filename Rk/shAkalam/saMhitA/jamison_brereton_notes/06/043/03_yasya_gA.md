This vs. subtly undermines the autonomous power of Indra. In the refrain of all three vss. Indra is addressed as svadhāpate ‘lord of independent power’, but here in the first hemistich Indra is said to be like (ná) “one grown strong by (his own) power,” like “one overpowering by his own forms of help” (svā́bhir ūtíbhih). In other words the power that appears to be Indra’s own (svá-) is really produced for him by soma.
