The identification of Soma with the Sun, noted passim above in the last two hymns, here begins the hymn.

The tr. “rosy (fingers)” is of course an unauthorized allusion to Homer’s “rosyfingered dawn” - though it is more legitimate than it might first appear. The word tr. ‘rosy’, úsri-, is ultimately derived from the ‘dawn’ word; cf. the related usrá-, usríya-, both of which are color terms representing the light of dawn (‘ruddy’) generally applied to bovines.

The next pāda, with its fem. subj. svásāro jāmáyaḥ “kindred sisters” is a standard way of referring to the fingers of the priests that prepare the soma (cf., e.g., IX.89.4). Thus the first two pādas superimpose two images: the ruddy Dawn(s) impelling the sun, the fingers impelling the soma - allowing each to participate in the imagery of the other. Because of the erotic relationship sometimes depicted between Dawn and the Sun, it would be better to tr.

pátim in b as “their husband” (with Ge, Re), not ‘lord’ as in the publ. tr. - making one more link between the imagery of pādas a and b.

Note that Ge nodded (slightly) in tr. mahā́n índum as “den grossen Indra,” enabled by the constant association between those two words in IX.
