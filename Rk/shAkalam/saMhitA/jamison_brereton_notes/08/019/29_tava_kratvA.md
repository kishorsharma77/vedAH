The three táva’s morph from subjective to objective genitives: the will (krátvā) is definitely exercised by Agni, hence subjective genitive, while the lauds (práśastibhiḥ) are those praising Agni, hence objective. The gifts (rātíbhiḥ) can be either those given by or given to Agni. This sequence is framed by two exx. of táva (…) ūtíbhiḥ “with your help(s)” (28a, 30a), with subjective genitive.
