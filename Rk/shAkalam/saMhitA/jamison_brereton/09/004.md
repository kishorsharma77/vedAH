Soma Pavamāna
Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa
10 verses: gāyatrī
Once again, the poet of this fourth hymn in the Soma Maṇḍala is also the author  of the fourth collection of hymns in Maṇḍala I (I.31–35), as well as another Soma  hymn, IX.69.
The thematic constriction of the soma hymns is even narrower than usual in this  hymn. A third of each verse is occupied by the self-contained refrain (pāda c: áthā no vásyasas kr̥dhi “then make us better off”), and many of the verses consist of  short imperative clauses. There are local repetitions as well: the initial “win!” (sánā)  of verses 1–3, the repeated pāda about resolve and help in verses 5b–6a, and the  initial “rush” (abhy àrṣa) of verses 7–8. Only two verses (6, 9) lack an imperative,  and the former contains an optative in similar usage.
These conscious formal limits of the hymn are obviously its point: content is  secondary. One might note, however, that the sun’s light is especially desired (vss.  2, 5, 6). 1. Win, Soma, and conquer great fame, self-purifying one.
– Then make us better off.
## 2
Win light, win the sun, and all the gifts of good fortune, Soma.
– Then make us better off.
## 3
Win skill and resolve. Soma, strike away the scorners.
– Then make us better off.
## 4
Purifiers, purify soma for Indra to drink.
– Then make us better off.
## 5
Give us a share in the sun through your resolve and your help.
– Then make us better off.
## 6
Through your resolve and your help might we see the sun for a
long time.
– Then make us better off.
## 7
Rush, well-armed Soma, toward double-lofty wealth.
– Then make us better off.
## 8
Rush toward wealth, as the unbudgeable victor in battles.
– Then make us better off.
## 9
They have increased you with sacrifices at your expansion,
self-purifying one.
– Then make us better off.
## 10
Bring us glittering wealth in horses, o drop, through our whole lifetime. – Then make us better off.
The pattern of matches between the order of poets in the Maṇḍala I and that of  IX is broken by IX.5. The next twenty hymns (IX.5–24) are attributed to Asita  Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa, poets not otherwise found in the Anukramaṇī list  of R̥gvedic poets, though there are other poets with the patronymic Kāśyapa, as  well as Kaśyapa Mārīca, to whom a number of hymns, including several in IX, are  attributed.
