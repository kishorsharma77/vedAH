The perfect in b, ví jajñe, is entirely ambiguous between √jan and √jñā, and I think it likely that both are meant. In this context there is not too much difference between a syllable being born and being discerned. The “track of the cow” is presumably here the ritual ground, and the reference is to the ritual speech of the dawn sacrifice. Re astutely notes the juxtaposition of akṣára- and padá-, reinforcing the speech theme, even though padá- has the sense of ‘track, footprint’ here. See padáin the next vs. (2b) for a possible reference to speech.

The standard tr. all supply a first-person subject in c, with a verb like “I proclaim.” No one but Old attempts to justify this addition, and his attempt is halfhearted. I instead take c as continuing b and take the underlying form of prabhū́ṣan to be prabhū́ṣat, neut. nom./acc. sg., before a following nasal, against the Pp. The participle modifies akṣáram in b. In my interpr. the “syllable” (that is, the essence of speech) attends to the gods’ commandments, perhaps by giving them imperishable verbal form. I also suggest that the “great syllable” is actually the refrain found in d; note that mahā́t in b takes the same position as it does in the refrain. The refrain may also be the most important of the gods’ vratas; see also 6c.
