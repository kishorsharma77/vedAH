The double vision of both heavenly Soma/Sun and earthly ritual soma is clear here, with pādas a, b, d all having a celestial orientation, each containing a form of div-/dyu- ‘heaven’, while the filter of pāda c brings us back to the ritual. The subj.

of d is probably, on the one hand, the ritual officiants, who perform the ritual action of milking (that is, pressing) the soma. But the substance obtained is “the beestings [colostrum, first milk] of heaven” (pīyúṣam … diváḥ), and the next vs. makes clear that those performing the milking here are also the venā́ḥ ‘seekers’ in 10b, where they are located “in the vault of heaven” (divó nā́ke).
