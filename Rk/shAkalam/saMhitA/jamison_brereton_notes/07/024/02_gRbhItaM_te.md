The striking expression “your mind … has been captured” presumably indicates that our successful preparations for the ritual have forcibly brought Indra to the soma sacrifice, with the implication that he is prevented from going to the sacrifices of others.

In pāda a dvibárhāḥ appears to be a masc. nom. sg., though I take it (as Ge does) as modifying neut. mánaḥ. Gr, by contrast, suggests that it belongs with masc.

sutáḥ sómaḥ in the following pāda. Although Gr’s solution might seem to be grammatically more satisfactory, on several occasions dvibárhā(ḥ) does seem to modify a neut.: I.114.10, VII.8.6, possibly IV.5.3, and AIG III.288 allows neut. sg. to

-as-stem adj. in -āḥ. In most instances, as here, the -āḥ is pāda-final, and so the long
vowel isn't metrically guaranteed.

Gotō (1stCl., 226 n. 483) interprets bharate in c not as a passive (with Gr, Ge, and me; also H-P Schmidt, Fs. Nyberg), but as a self-involved middle: “Lobpreisung, deren Milchstrom losgelassen ist, bringt [ihre Milch] dar,” on the basis of his principle that medial Class I presents cannot be used passively. But in my opinion at least, this principle cannot be maintained in general, and certainly in this context, with passive expressions dominating the first hemistich, a passive reading is most natural and the image of the praise hymn bringing its own milk borders on the comic.

With others I take pāda d as an extension of c, with iyám … manīṣā́an appositive to suvṛktíḥ. However, it would be possible to take it independently: “this inspired thought is constantly invoking Indra,” since, though fairly rare, predicated present participles do exist, and the short staccato clauses of the earlier part of the hymn may invite an independent reading here.
