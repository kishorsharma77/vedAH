satáḥ in c is somewhat puzzling. Both Ge and Re take it as adverbial: “in gleicher Weise,” “pareillement.” Ge makes no comment; Re adduces sató-mahant-, -vīra-. For this 1st cmpd member see comm. ad VII.104.21. As I point out there, though I think the cmpds in question contain this adverbial element, I do not think it exists as an independent word.

Supposed exx. of it belong instead to the pres. part. of √as, either gen./abl. sg. or acc. pl.

Here I take it as the gen. sg., dependent on matím. Genitives appearing with this stem generally refer to the poet (e.g., IX.64.10 kavīnā́m matī́). Forms of √as, incl. the pres. part., can have the extended sense ‘be real / really present’, and that is how I take it here. Cf. for a similar use in a nearby hymn IX.19.7 dūré vā sató ánti vā “whether he be in the distance or nearby” (used of an enemy); also IX.31.6 (of Soma).
