Act. úd iyarti, esp. in contrast with its med. correspondent úd īrate in 2a, should be transitive. With Ge, the pub. tr. renders it as intransitive (‘arises’). WG take it as transitive and supply ‘sun’ as the object. I am now inclined to think that it is transitive (the contrastive verb in 2a has convinced me), but am uncertain what object to supply. The most common object of íyarti is ‘speech’ (vel sim.), but curiously for a RVic hymn, there is no mention of speech or praise-song in this hymn (until a cmpd. in the final vs., 7a dhiyaṃdhā́- ‘setting my insight’). Since the subj. of intrans. úd īrate in 2 is chariots and horses, I think the object here should be the chariot whose hitching up is described in the rest of the hemistich. I would therefore emend the tr. to “Now this radiant beam impels (the chariot) upward.” The radiant beam is presumably the ritual fire, though it might be the beam of dawn, an identification that finds support in the mention of dawn in 2b. The chariot being impelled upward may not be the same as the Aśvins’ chariot in the rest of the hemistich, but the complementary “chariot” of the ritual.

For the mild paradox in c, the three who form a pair, see publ. intro. That this refers to the two Aśvins paired with Sūryā was already well recognized by Ge (see his n. 1c).
