The third truth-formulation vs. sets up the Vala myth as the model for the coming of dawn: just as the Aṅgirases breached the Vala cave and let loose the cows, so the human sacrificers break Dawn out of her confinement by kindling the ritual fire. This is the third step in the depiction of the morning ritual. As noted elsewhere (see esp. the publ. intro to Maṇḍala IV and to IV.1), the Vala myth and the Aṅgirases play an outsize role in the Agni cycle of IV.

Despite the injunctives of pāda a (vy àsan) and c (pári ṣadan), I am tempted, with Gr, to read anavanta in b, to produce 11 syllables. (Consider the augmented impf. in d, abhavat.) Old (Noten) considers this restoration possible but not necessary. Hoffmann (Injunk., 209) gives a typical treatment of the vs. in his interpretational system, assuming an injunc. navanta in b.
