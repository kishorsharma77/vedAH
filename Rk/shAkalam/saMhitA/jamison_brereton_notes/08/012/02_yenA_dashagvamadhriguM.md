Unlike Ge I take svàrṇara- here as an epithet of Adhrigu, rather than a PN (sim. VIII.3.12), though not on strong grounds, and VIII.6.39, where I do take it as a PN, undercuts this position.

Either Adhrigu or, if he is a personage, Svarṇara receives the qualifier vepáyant- ‘setting atremble’, without an object. Given how little we know about Adhrigu (or Svarṇara), it is not clear what such an object might be, though it might refer to poetic inspiration.
