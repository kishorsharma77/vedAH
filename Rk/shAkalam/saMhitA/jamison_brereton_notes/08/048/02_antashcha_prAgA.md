The first pāda is a paradox, in that confinement within leads to boundlessness. Following Ge et al., I take ca as a subordinator; the accentuation of prā́gā(ḥ) is ambiguous: the Pp. reads prá agāḥ, but pra-ágāḥ is equally possible (so Old).

How to resolve the sandhi in śraúṣṭīva is discussed by Old at some length; with him I take it as a fem. nom. sg. śraúṣṭī. The Pp. analyzes rāyá as rāyé, but rāyáḥ is also possible, either as gen. sg. or acc. pl. I take it as the latter. My tr. of this pāda is closest to Re’s.
