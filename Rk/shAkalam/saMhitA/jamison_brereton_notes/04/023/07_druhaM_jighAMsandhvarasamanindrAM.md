The tr. of tétikte, ‘sharpens’, may not seem to express its intensive semantics, but plain ‘sharpen’ itself incorporates the iterative, repetitive motions of blade across stone that sharpening involves.

Ge notes the similarity of ṛṇā́cid to the root noun cmpd ṛṇa-cít- ‘collector of debts’ found in the strikingly similar phrase II.23.17 sá r̥ṇacíd rṇ̥ ayā́(ḥ). But there are no grounds to emend the phrase to a compound, though a deliberate echo seems possible. In fact changing the text here would have the disadvantage of eliminating the obvious object to babādhé.
