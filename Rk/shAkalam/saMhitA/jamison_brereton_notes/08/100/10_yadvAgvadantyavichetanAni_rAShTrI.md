Ge is understandably reluctant to construe avicetanā́ni with vádantī, since this attributes unintelligible speech to Speech herself, but his solution, to construe the neut. pl. loosely with niṣasā́da (“… sich bei den unvernünftigen (Geschöpfen) niederliess”), does not work syntactically. Old’s mythological explanation is preferable.
