The connection between the two hemistichs in this vs. is not clear. The first unambiguously presents the here-and-now of the sacrifice, with an impv. and the adv.

ihá ‘here’, while the second harks back to Indra’s primordial birth and the gods’ attendance on it, expressed by an augmented imperf. (ábhūṣan). There is no way to reconcile the temporal disjunction directly, so I have adopted Ge’s makeshift: supplying “(wie damals),” though there is no overt representation of my “as” (or his “wie damals”). There does not seem to be much semantic connection between the two halves either, unless we, the pressers and offerers, are being identified with the gods who served Indra at his birth.
