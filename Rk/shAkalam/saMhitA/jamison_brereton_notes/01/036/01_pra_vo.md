purūṇā́m is generally construed as qualifying yahvám, but this requires taking the latter as an implicit superlative (Ge “den Jüngsten unter vielen”), which it is not.

(JL points out that a derivative of the real superlative, yáviṣṭhya, appears twice in the hymn, vss. 6, 15.) Better to take it as parallel to viśā́m, though, since víś- is fem., not modifying it as Proferes (2007: 31) does.

I.36.10, 17: As often, it is difficult to know when to tr. analyzable words as PNs rather than literally. There is no particular reason that I explicitly allowed both possibilities in vs. 10 and only the PN in 17.
