The publ. tr. takes the pres. part. vardháyan as the predicate of the vs., though it might be possible to take sutáḥ instead (“You, the strengthening one, are pressed …”).

Although a predicated ppl. sutáḥ would better conform to RVic syntactic patterns, predicating the pres. part. seems to produce better sense: it provides the reason why the gods (and) the Maruts consume soma in vs. 3.
