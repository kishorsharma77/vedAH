This vs. does not contain an overt referent for the rel. cl. of the previous vs. Ge, Re, and the publ. tr. all supply both this antecedent and a verb: “to him come.” This makes sense, but the only (indirect) support for it is abhí ‘towards’. I would be more comfortable if abhí were initial.

There are several candidates for the identity of the “two mothers of truth” ṛtásya mātárā. The exact phrase yahvī́ṛtásya mātárā refers both to Night and Dawn (I.142.7, V.5.6) and to the two World Halves (VI.17.6, X.59.8). In IX.33.5 in the plural it refers to sacred formulations configured as cows. On the phrase see Lü (631), who rightly disputes Ge’s “… (Tochter) und Mütter”; Lü thinks the ref. here is to the World Halves, but gives no evidence that I could see. However, this identification is likely to be correct, in that samīciné in all three of its other occurrences, incl. 2 in this maṇḍala (IX.74.2, 90.4, X.44.8), is used of the World Halves.

The 2nd hemistich changes subject abruptly without a signal, beyond the change in number/gender from fem. du. (samīciné … yahvī́… mātárā) to masc. pl. in cd. In fact the plural number only becomes clear with the last word, the 3rd pl. verb añjaté; the part. tanvānā́(ḥ) that opens the hemistich could be du., given its sandhi position, tanvānā́yajñám - but it would have to be masc. du. The identity of the masc. pl. is not clear, but the default, esp. given the meaning and usage of both the part. and the finite verb, would be the ritual officiants.

The fourth, short pāda superficially looks like those in vss. 4 and 5, though in opposite order—yád añjate—but it is not self-contained like them but belongs to the clause in c. Nonetheless, the positioning of yád at the beginning of the little pāda provides the same bit of distance we’ve found in most of the vss. of this hymn.
