The question in the first hemistich is what to do with maháḥ. Ge must take it as an acc. construed with yatasva: “vergleiche dich mit [come to terms with] den Grossen ...” But this pushes the sense and syntax of medial √yat, which generally refers to physical placement (an interpr. encouraged by the seat [sádane] here) and never otherwise takes an acc. Re takes it as adverbial, while WG maintain Ge’s acc. pl. but read it with nṝ́n in the previous pāda (“den … grossen Männern”), starting a new clause with pā́rthive. I take it as gen. sg., referring to the Marut flock, as in 1a.

Alternatively it could refer to Agni and the earthly seat could be the ritual ground.

On pṛthubudhná-, lit. ‘broad based’, see Thieme’s brief remarks (Fremdling, p. 63 with n. 1). As he points out, it should not refer to the antelopes’ broad Untergestell (with Ge), since antelopes are not particularly bulky, but rather to the large amount of ground they cover. I take ‘base’ as equivalent to ‘stride’, somewhat like English ‘wheelbase’.
