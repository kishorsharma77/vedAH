viṣudrúheva (that is, -ā+iva) is quite problematic. Ge refuses to tr., as does Scar (245-46), though by classing it with -druh-compounds, he indicates a root affiliation. Acdg. to Re, it’s the equivalent of *druhó viśuvṛ́t “opposé au Mal” or “qui met le Mal en déroute”; somewhat sim. Kü 484 “Wie die nach verschiedenen Seiten Trügenden (?).” What all these suggestions have in common is the assumption that the 2nd member belong to √druh ‘deceive’. I suggest a different analysis, viṣud-rúh-, where the 2nd member is the root noun to √ruh ‘mount’, and the first (viṣud-) is a deformed version of the already deformed adverb viṣvadryàk ‘facing in different directions’, with the complex adverbial suffix found also in asmadryàk ‘facing towards us’. The empty -d- (/-t-) has been suffixed to the combining form viṣu- (/viṣū) underlying the adjective víṣvañc- ‘facing in different directions’. For the suggested phrase, cf. IX.75.1 ráthaṃ víṣvañcam aruhat “he mounted the chariot that faces in different directons” (with √ruh) and, with semantically related √yuj and horses not chariot, VI.59.5 víṣūco áśvān yuyujāná īyate; X.79.7 víṣūco áśvān yuyuje vanejā́ḥ.
