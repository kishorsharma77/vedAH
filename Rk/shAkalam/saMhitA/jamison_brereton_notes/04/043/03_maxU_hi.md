This vs. gives the answer to the questions in 1-2: the Aśvins. As was just indicated, this answer was adumbrated by 2cd, but indirectly, via a mention of a chariot that could only belong to the Aśvins. Now we finally have a verse couched in the dual, but note that the name Aśvin (or Nāsatya) is not found; the dual is enough.

Pāda a gives an implicit answer to 2a -- katamá ā́gamiṣṭhaḥ “Which one (will be) the first to come?” -- by asserting that they “come right away” (makṣū́… gáchathaḥ). I don’t quite understand ī́vato dyū́n “during/through days such as these”; I assume it indicates that even in our time (not merely in the mythological past), they still rush right here.

In b śaktím is a slightly odd goal. Ge takes it as an infinitive, a use of the acc. of the -tí-stem I’d rather avoid. I think it means “comes into his ability/power” -- i.e., is immediately able to wield it at the necessary, decisive moment.

Pāda d, with the two forms of √śac (śácīnām … śáciṣṭhā) echoing śaktím in b, seems to allow the possibility that the Aśvins have comparable, but different, abilities from Indra’s.
