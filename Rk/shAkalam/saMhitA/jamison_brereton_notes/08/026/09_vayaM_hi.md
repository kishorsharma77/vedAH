vayám … ukṣaṇyánto vyaśvavát is a play on words. ukṣanyántaḥ is read doubly, in one sense in the frame (‘seeking bulls’) and another in the simile (‘seeking Ukṣan’). Unusually the simile is conveyed by -vát. On the poet Vyaśva seeking his patron Ukṣan, see VIII.23.16 vyàśvaḥ … ukṣaṇyúḥ, where ukṣanyúḥ can also be read as a pun.
