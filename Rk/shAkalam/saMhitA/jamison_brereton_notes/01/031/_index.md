Agni This is the first of five hymns attributed to Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa and the only one addressed to Agni. It is noteworthy that the hymn begins and ends with references to the Aṅgirases: 1a (agne ...) áṅgirā ṛ́ṣiḥ, 2a (agne ...) áṅgirastamaḥ and 17a (the last vs. before the extra-hymnic summary vs.) (agne) aṅgirasvád aṅgiraḥ, a reference to his parentage and a word that often plays off its phonological similarity to agní- (cf. RV I.1), a voc. of which occurs in every vs. in this hymn.

I.31.1-2: Some reciprocal vocabulary: in 1c the kavis (the Maruts) are born under the vrata of Agni, while in 2b Agni as kavi tends to the vrata of the gods.
