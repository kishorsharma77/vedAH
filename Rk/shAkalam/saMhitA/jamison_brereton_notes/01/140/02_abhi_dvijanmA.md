I take trivṛ́t as a qualifier of ánnam ‘food’ (so also Re, Old [SBE], Sāy, WG); however, I am not sure what tripartition of food is meant. Ge in his n. (2a) suggests wood, ghee, and soma (more or less flg. Sāy), but because the next pāda concerns only the plant food that Agni has eaten and that regenerates in a year, I am reluctant to divide the focus. It is also possible to take trivṛ́t as an adverb, as Ge does (“… eilt dreifältig …”), but this merely transfers the problem.

In the second hemistich “the one / the other” are easier to identify. Pāda c concerns the ritual fire, while d treats the wild fire, each represented by a characteristic animal: in c the “thoroughbred bull” (jényo vṛ́ṣā), which, despite its power, is a domesticated beast, while the (wild) elephant (vāraṇáḥ) of d rampages in the forest.

I don’t understand the position of ī: ī(m) and sīm generally occupy Wackernagel’s position. In this case it may mark jagdhám as a notional relative clause, as in my tr. “what was eaten,” though the following word púnaḥ unfortunately must be construed with the main verb vāvṛdhe.

In c the initial position of anyásya violates my rule (1997, Fs. Beekes) for definite anyá- placement, but anyéna in d is correctly positioned.
