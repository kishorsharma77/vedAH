Though the verse starts promisingly, with two identifiable myths (Vala, pāda a; Atri, pāda b -- though the 100-doored [house] is not otherwise known), the second hemistich brings obscurity. As noted in the intro., the standard myth about Vimada involves the Aśvins bringing him a wife, usually with the verb (ní) √vah. Is this the same story, with vásu ‘good thing’ a generic substitution for ‘wife’, or is Indra’s relationship with Vimada of a different sort from the Aśvins’? As for pāda d, the action here is completely obscure (see Ge’s somewhat desperate note attempting to make this about a rocky nest [Felsennest] of robbers), and what it has to do with the Vimada story is equally obscure. Since nartáyan in d is only a participle, it should be attached to the main clause in c rather than relating a separate myth. A final bit of obscurity is saséna ‘with grain’, which opens c. The stem sasá- generally shows up in enigmatic phrases referring, probably, to the ritual grass and/or the cereal ritual oblations.
