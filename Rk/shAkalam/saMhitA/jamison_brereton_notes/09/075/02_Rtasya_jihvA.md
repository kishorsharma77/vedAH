The publ. tr. contains a clear error — ‘father’ instead of ‘lord’, for pátiḥ in b — a regrettable lapse. It should be corrected to “speaker and lord,” and “father” in the publ. intro. should likewise be changed.

Old finds “tongue” as a descriptor of Soma “bizarr,” but given how much emphasis is placed in IX on Soma’s noise-making capabilities and association with speech, I don’t see why. This vs. depicts Soma as the origin and controller of speech and name-giving, while in vs. 1 (ab) in complementary fashion he aims towards and is nourished by the names given him by others, or so I interpr. it.

As Ge points out, cd is (partially) illuminated by I.155.3cd, whose d pāda is identical to ours: dádhāti putró ávaram páram pitúr, nā́ma tṛtī́yam ádhi rocané diváḥ “The son [=Viṣṇu] sets in place the lower and the higher (names) of the father and the third name in the luminous realm of heaven.” In both cases the entities in question in the c pāda are surely Heaven and Earth (so for our passage both Ge [n.

2cd] and Re). The “luminous realm of heaven” must be the realm beyond the nearer sky; the “third realm” (tṛtī́ye rájasi) appears in the preceding hymn (IX.74.6), though the same geographical area may not be in question. In any case Soma’s ability to name these cosmic entities emphasizes his global mastery of speech, and the paradox of the son naming his parents makes the wonder all the greater.
