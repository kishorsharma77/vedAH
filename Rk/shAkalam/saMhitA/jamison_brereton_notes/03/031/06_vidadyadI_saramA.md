Ge (/WG) interpret ab as a direct quotation from the gods, for reasons that are unclear to me. Although an immediate past reading might help account for the injunctive aorists vidát (a) and kaḥ (b), in fact the second hemistich also contains two injunctives, nayat (c) and gāt (d), the latter of which is also an aorist. So there is no clear grammatical distinction between the two half-verses, and the subject (Saramā) also remains the same throughout (by most interpr.), with all four pādas focusing on the same narrative. Other interpreters (Re, Lü, Schmidt) ignore this odd decision of Ge’s.

In a yádī should be read yád ī; see 2c above.

In b pā́thaḥ ordinarily means ‘fold, pen’, but here refers to the herd confined in the fold: the shift from container to contained is a common one in semantic change.

ákṣarāṇām in c most likely has double reference, both to the cows that are being released from the Vala cave and the syllables of the Aṅgirases’ song that effects that release.

Ge makes the point (n. 6d) that ráva- in this context otherwise only refers to the Aṅgirases’s song; this leads him to switch the subject to Uṣas, as the first out of the cave, coming in response to the sound of the Aṅgirases. This seems, on the one hand, over-finicky -- why introduce another female character in the middle of a vs. without signaling it? -- and, on the other, rather deaf to the possibility of multiple meanings that always lurks in RVic discourse. One of the points of the Vala myth in general seems to me the mirroring of sounds: the song that releases the cows and their joyous counter-mooing in response -- an obvious place for a poet to allow a single word to do double duty. This same double reference is found in the preceding pāda in ákṣarāṇām. Schmidt (B+I 167) also takes the ráva- to be that of Indra and the Aṅgirases and in fact makes Uṣas the subject of the whole 2nd hemistich. I do not see the need for this.
