Indra
Vasukra Aindra
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Shorter than Vasukra’s other two hymns, but no less daunting in the intricacy of  its expression, especially in verse 1, which displays phonological, morphologi cal, and syntactic tricks too numerous and too dense to discuss in detail here.  (See Jamison [forthcoming c].) Suffice it to say that the verse manages to refer,  by indirection and implication, to the five most important gods at the dawn rit ual: Agni, Indra, Vāyu, and the Aśvins, though only Indra is named. (Dawn is  the sole important divinity absent, but she appears in the first pāda of the next  verse.) Besides the common R̥gvedic habit of employing words applicable to two  or more referents, the verse shows in embryo a device prized in later kāvya: that  of allowing a single phonological sequence to be read in two of more different  ways by means of variant word divisions. Add to this an unprecedented syntactic construction, which is also a syntactic pun, and dizziness ensues for the hearer/ reader.
The structure and thematic contents of the hymn are less clear than in X.27 and  28, however. After the first two extremely opaque verses, which appear to treat the  dawn ritual and the divine conjunction of Indra and Agni (and probably of the two  Aśvins), the poet turns his hopes and attention to attracting Indra to show himself  at the sacrifice, to produce an epiphany (see esp. vs. 4), through properly performed  offerings. There are a number of obscurities in these verses as well, especially verse  5, and the lack of a perceptible structure hampers our efforts to clarify them. Much  remains to be excavated from this rich poetic mine.
