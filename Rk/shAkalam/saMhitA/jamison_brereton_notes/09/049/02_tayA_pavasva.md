The intent of this vs. is pretty clear, though the expression is a bit contorted: presumably our offering of soma will bring cows as a reward, but how the cows will come “by a stream” of purified soma is unclear. I imagine them in single file, but I don’t think that’s what’s meant.

The adj. qualifying cows, jánya-, is generally interpr. as pregnantly ‘belonging to other people’ (Ge “die Rinder anderer Leute,” Re “les vaches de l’étranger,” enshrined in Gr’s gloss 2a ‘fremden Leuten ausgehend’), but as I disc. ad IV.55.5, in all clear passages jánya- means ‘stemming from one’s own people’. Here it may be proleptic: cows will come here that will by virtue of coming here belong to us.

Note that úpa naḥ is somewhat displaced, though not as much as ā́sú naḥ in 1a.
