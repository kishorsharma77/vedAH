In b enā́can simply be adverbial, as Ge and KH (Injunk. 168) take it, but it is also regularly used as demonstrative with forms like námasā ‘homage’ (I.171.1, II.23.14, etc.), sūkténa ‘hymn’ (II.6.2), bráhmaṇā (IV.36.7), and in this context, where the sacrifice is mentioned (yajñaíḥ), I think it likely that the verbal part of the ritual evidenced by the verb prá … stavante “they start up the praise” is further specified with the near deictic, referring to this current praise hymn.

The syntactic relationship between pādas c and d is ambiguous. With Ge, I take d as the main cl., with c dependent on it. But KH (Injunk. 168) takes them as parallel subordinate clauses dependent on b. Either is possible, because the verb of d, (d)hán, is initial in the pāda and can owe its accent to that alone.

Note the allit. in (śā́ra)dīr dárd, dhán dā́s(īḥ), esp. noticeable because it consists of four syllables in a row, belonging to four separate words.

Old (ZDMG 55.329-30 and Noten) calls dart in c into question, arguing that it should be a 2nd ps. and the -t is faulty. But there seems no reason not to assume that both dart and (d)han are 3rd ps. verbs; although Indra is referred to in the 2nd ps. in pāda a, shift between the persons is a commonplace in RVic discourse. The sandhi situation here favors the retention of the -t, though the matter is somewhat complex.

As is generally known, final clusters are simplified, retaining only the first. The exception is that -t, -ṭ, and -k after -r- are retained if they belong to the root (Wh, Gr.

§150b Macd. VGS §28a, etc.) -- which the -t in dar-t does not (√dṛ). However, dart is pāda-final and the next pāda begins in the transmitted text with dhán (for hán), whose dh is the automatic result of the (re-)introduction of occlusion of initial hafter a final stop (see, e.g., Wh, Gr. §163). The standard practice is that the h- is replaced by the voiced aspirate corresponding to the place of articulartion of the final stop -- in this case, a dental. If we assume that this rule was operative before final clusters were simplified, a sequence of 3rd sg. dard dhán with apparently pleonastic gemination would favor the non-simplification of the cluster -rd dh-. (On cases of gemination and degemination in the text, see my “False Segmentations and Resegmentations in the Rigveda: Gemination and Degemination” [to appear in a forthcoming Fs.].) Pāda c is identical to I.174.2b, and in that passage the case is more difficult because there the context is entirely 2nd ps. As I argued in the comm. to that vs. (q.v.), the final -t there may have been introduced from our passage.
