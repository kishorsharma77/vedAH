Maruts
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
9 verses: br̥hatī, except satobr̥hatī 3, 7
Unlike the previous Marut hymns, this one introduces—and indeed begins with— other personnel besides the Maruts. The first word in the hymn is a vocative  addressed to the god Agni, and he (or perhaps the poet) is addressed elsewhere in  the hymn (vss. 2, 5). The Earth appears in verse 3 as a literally battered woman, a  remarkable image, and this female figure anticipates that of Rodasī, frequent com panion and consort of the Maruts, in verses 8–9.
The poet repeatedly calls the Maruts to come here: the forms “I call,” “we call,”  and “calls” frame and punctuate the hymn (vss. 1, 2, 5, 8, 9), while the invocation of  Agni at the beginning and the description of Agni in verse 7 establish the sacrifice as  the goal of their journey. But it is the verses describing the journey itself (especially  3–4) that are the most memorable part of this hymn.
