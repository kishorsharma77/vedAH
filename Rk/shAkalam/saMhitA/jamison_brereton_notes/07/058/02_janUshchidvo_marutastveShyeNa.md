Like the gen. phrase in 1b, the instr. tveṣyèṇa has insufficient syntactic grounding in its clause. Like Ge “(geschieht)” and Re “(s’est produite),” I see no choice but to supply a verb to link the subject janū́ḥ and the instr.

I have no opinion on the morphology of janū́ḥ. Gr calls it a masculine nom. sg.

to the -us-stem janús-, an interpr. bolstered by the acc. form janúṣam (3x). AiG II.2.490 posits a paradigm of alternating gender, with m. or f. in the (nom./acc.) singular, but neuter in the dual and plural, which accords with the distribution of forms in the RV (du. janúṣī, pl. janū́ṃṣi) but fails to account for the gender switch. In the same vol. (II.2.496-97) Debrunner suggests that our janū́ḥ belongs to a -ū-stem (though acc. janúṣam would still need to be a masc. [or fem.] form to an -us-stem).

The problem is that non-neut. forms of -is- and -us-stems don’t lengthen the suffixal vowel in the nom. sg., unlike -as-stems. However, it seems possible that our janū́ḥ contains a nonce lengthening on the model of the vastly more common masc. -asstems, as AiG III.292 indirectly allows. It should also be noted that because of following cid, the suffixal syllable of the preceding noun would be heavy, whether it originally read janū́ś cid, as in the transmitted text, or *janúś cid, as grammar would have us expect.

The relationship between the first hemistich and the rel. cl. in c displays the RV’s customary willingness to switch person reference in midstream and without 91 warning. The first hemistich refers to the Maruts in the 2nd ps., with the enclitic vaḥ in a and the b pāda consisting only of vocatives. Because there is nothing to lean on, all three vocatives are accented, but in all three cases the initial accent contrasts with the inherent accent of the stem: bhī́māsaḥ (bhīmá-); túvimanyavaḥ (tuvi- cmpds. are accented either on the 2nd member [e.g., tuvi-rā́dhas-] or on the 2nd syllable of the first member [e.g., tuví-brahman-]); áyāsaḥ (ayā́s-). There could therefore be no doubt that the reference is 2nd person; yet the rel. cl. that picks up the referents with the nom. pl. prn. yé is unequivocally in the 3rd ps.: (prá …) sánti. The following pāda returns to 2nd ps. ref. with vaḥ.

On the “X Y utá” construction (rather than expected X utá Y) see Klein DGRV I. 344ff.
