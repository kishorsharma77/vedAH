Heaven and Earth
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: jagatī
This celebration of Heaven and Earth associates them with all sorts of beneficial  liquids. The first word in the hymn is “ghee,” and in the rest of that verse we find  milk, honey, and semen, all of which recur in the hymn: note especially the parallel  verses 4 and 5 devoted to ghee and honey respectively. Besides these liquid endow
ments, the physical qualities of the two divinities are barely mentioned; it is instead  their status as objects of worship and praise at the sacrifice and their ability to grant  rewards to us that preoccupy the poet.
