As noted above, it’s quite possible, even likely, that the beacon in pāda a is a reference to the sun and therefore another assimilation of Soma to the Sun, as is more explicit in vss. 7 and 9. For the association between ketú- and the sun, cf., e.g., VII.63.2 ketúḥ … sū́ryasya. Lü (702) suggests rather that the ketú- is lightning, without argument.

Ge renders b as “… rinnst du ... alle Farben annehmend”; similar Lü (702) “strömst du vom Himmel her in alle Erscheinungsformen.” But the acc. with abhí √ṛṣ is always a goal (to choose just one example, cf. nearby IX.62.3 abhy àrṣanti suṣṭutím “they rush towards the lovely praise-hymn”), and I don’t see where (or why) they get their alternative interpr. By my interpr. the “all forms” to which the soma rushes could be the materials the soma will be mixed with (water, milk), or everything found on the ritual ground, or indeed everything on earth and in the midspace, the “all goods” of vs. 6.
