The standard tr. take bhágaḥ as the subj. of mṛdhyā(ḥ) in c; e.g., Ge “Bhaga [das Glück] möge in meiner Freundschaft nicht fehlen, o Agni.” With such a 3rd ps. subj., this requires mṛdhyāḥ to be a precative (Re calls it a “pseudo-précatif” for some reason) rather than a straight 2nd sg. opt. This is, of course, not impossible.

But the desire expressed here, that Agni make sure that Bhaga does the right thing, does not seem the usual type of prayer addressed to gods in the RV. I take pāda c as consisting of two clauses, the first nominal, the 2nd, addressed to Agni, consisting only of a negative and a verb (cf. for this construction with this verb, ná mardhanti in 14d above), with Agni the subj. I take bhágaḥ as a common noun in the publ. tr.; alternatively it might mean “(May) Bhaga (be) in partnership with me.” The final word of the vs., the gen. purukṣóḥ ‘consisting in much livestock’, is a bahuvrīhi variant of the phrase bhū́ri paśváḥ ‘abundance of livestock’, likewise ending its vs. in 15d.
