vibālī́- is almost universally taken as the name of (another) river, though the name (and indeed the word) shows up nowhere else. By contrast, in the first ed.

of the dictionary (1872) MonWms. takes it as an adj. vibālya- “passed beyond a state of youth, in full vigor; swollen (said of a river),” though in the 2nd ed. (1899) it is simply the fem. river name vibālī́-. WG take it not as a toponym but with the sense ‘mit breiter Öffnung’. An attributive adjective would certainly be preferable to an unlocatable placename. Although WG give no explan. of their interpr., it rests on earlier discussions, whose details can be recovered in EWA (s.v.). EWA considers it the name of a river (produced from the confluence of the Vipās and the Śutudrī), but derived from a word with the same (or similar) sense as WG ascribe to it: ‘dessen Ufer weit auseinanderstehen’, an early MIA word with -bāra- representing pārá- ‘far shore’. See the lit. cited there.
