\#ábhūd uṣā́(ḥ) is reminiscent of \#ábhūd agníḥ in VII.77.2, though there the construction involved a predicated infinitive. See also VII.76.2 #ábhūd u ketúr uṣásaḥ.

Dawn is índratamā because she is maghónī ‘bounteous’ as he is maghávan(t)-.

The splv. suffix -tamā echoes támaḥ ‘darkness’ in the prevous vs., 2c.

As Re points out, suvitā́ya in b recalls duritā́in VII.78.2.

Pāda c displays heavy alliteration: ví divó devī́duhitā́dadhāti. The pattern is set in motion by the preverb ví, which, as was noted above, is the hymn’s signature word. The first three words in c have ví itself, its inverse (d)iv(ó), and a long-vowel variant (de)vī́, but in the meantime the d pattern has asserted itself and carries through to the end of the pāda. The elements of this sequence are found nearby each other in other hymns in this cycle, though not with the same intense concentration. Cf. esp. VII.77.5-6: 5b devi, 5c dádhatī, 6a divó duhitā́.
