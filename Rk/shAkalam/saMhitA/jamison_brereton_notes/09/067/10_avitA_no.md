The publ. tr. presents the journeys as ours, reading naḥ with both avitā́and yā́mani-yāmani. Ge and Re instead assume the journeys are Pūṣan’s: e.g., “Unser Gönner ist Pūṣan, der auf jeder Ausfahrt Böcke als Rosse hat.” Since one hymn devoted to Pūṣan, I.42, is almost entirely devoted to Pūṣan’s protection of us on the journey and on the path and in the short Pūṣan cycle in VI (VI.53-58) the god is several times asked to lead or direct us (e.g., VI.53.2) and to clear paths for us (VI.53.4, 54.1-2), I think it likely that the focus here is on our journeys.
