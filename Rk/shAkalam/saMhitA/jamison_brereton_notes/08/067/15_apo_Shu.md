The doubling of 1st pl. pronouns, naḥ … asmát can be interpr. in two different ways. On the one hand, naḥ can be just a Wackernagel-position placeholder, doubled by the more emphatic (and case-marked) asmát later in the vs. Of course enclitic naḥ is not technically supposed to represent an ablative, but I think that all bets are off with Wackernagel-position pronominal enclitics. Or the naḥ can actually be an accusative, construed with ájaghnuṣī.
