Soma Pavamāna
Andhīgu Śyāvāśvi (1–3), Yayāti Nāhuṣa (4–6), Nahuṣa Mānava (7–9), Manu  Sāṃvaraṇa (10–12), Prajāpati (13–16)
16 verses: anuṣṭubh, except gāyatrī 2–3, arranged in trcas ̥
In order to conform to the pattern of arrangement, this last hymn in the anuṣṭubh  group must actually have consisted originally of five three-verse hymns, with a single  verse (16) appended, as was already pointed out by Oldenberg (1888: 201). There is,  however, some interconnection among the tr̥cas that points to a sense of cohesion.  In particular, the first and last tr̥cas (vss. 1–3 and 13–15) are linked by the striking  image in their first verses (1, 13) of a sacrifice-defiling dog drawn to the sound of  the soma being pressed, a dog that must be driven away. Verse 13 also contains a  brief and enigmatic allusion to a myth also enigmatically mentioned to in X.171.2.
Most of the rest of the hymn contains standard material: the details of prepara tion of the drink and its journey across the filter to mix with the milk, as well as its  relationship to the gods, especially Indra. There is some internal unity visible in the  individual tr̥cas, but it is not pronounced.
