Dialogue between Agni and the Gods
Agni Saucīka
9 verses: triṣṭubh
The classic dialogue between Agni and the gods (or one or more gods: he addresses  Mitra and Varuṇa [vs.  2] and Varuṇa alone [vss. 4,  6]). Agni appears still to be  in the waters (or just emerged), and the gods have only recently discovered his  hiding place. The first question is which god spotted him (vss. 1–3). Agni then describes the fear that drove him from his sacrificial role, in responsive language  that defines an omphalos (vss. 4, 6, esp. 4a and 6c). In the omphalos verse (5) the  gods make the argument that Manu, a human and the first sacrificer, deserves to  have his sacrifice completed by Agni’s conveyance of the oblations. It is striking that  the gods, perhaps disingenuously, do not argue for their own deserving state. In the  last three verses (7–9) the gods propose rewards for Agni’s returning to his task, and  he accepts them.
