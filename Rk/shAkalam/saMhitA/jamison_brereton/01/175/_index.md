Indra
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: anuṣṭubh, except skhandogrīvī 1, triṣṭubh 6
The shorter compass of dimeter meter (vss. 1–5) seems to cramp Agastya’s style  somewhat. The most obvious device in this hymn is the relentless repetition of  forms derived from a very few roots: mad “become exhilarated” (vss. 1, 2, 5), sah “be victorious” (vss. 2–3), san/sā “win” (vss. 1, 2, 3, 5). These three roots create an  inescapable poetic logic of cause (exhilaration) and effect (conquer [enemies] and  win [prizes]), but the effect is still rather clumsy.
Verse 4 stands out as the exception, as it contains no forms of any of the signa ture roots, and it compresses within it a whole mythological complex: the stealing  of the wheel of the Sun, and the involvement of Kutsa, the horses of the Wind, and,  by implication, Uśanā Kāvya in that obscure story—a myth also alluded to in the  preceding hymn (I.174.5, 7, as well as often elsewhere, e.g., I.130.9).
One other feature is worthy of note: the image in verse 3cd, of Indra “firing” the  Dasyu like a piece of pottery.
