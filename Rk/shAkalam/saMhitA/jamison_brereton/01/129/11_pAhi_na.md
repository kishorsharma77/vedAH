Protect us, well-praised Indra, from failure, (you who are) always  a requiter of bad thoughts—as a god (a requiter) of bad  
thoughts—  
a smasher of the evil demon, a rescuer of a poet like me.  
For the begetter has begotten you for this reason, o good one—has  
begotten you as smasher of demons, o good one.
