In the causative infinitival phrase akṛṇoḥ pṛthivī́ṃ saṃdṛ́śe divé, Re and WG take dat. heaven as subj. and acc. earth as obj. of the dat. infinitive, in contrast to the publ. tr. and Ge. Since the usual obj. of the infinitive dṛśé is the sun, the Ge/JPB interpr. seems more likely, in that it also involves looking heavenward. Note also that in 8ab the datives pṛkṣā́ya and dāsáveśāya are objects of the dative infin. níhantave, with the same syntactic pattern as is suggested here. There is also an occurrence of the same stem saṃdṛ́ś- in the acc. pl. in 10c, but this seems to have no clear relationship to the dative here and is, in any case, quite opaque.
