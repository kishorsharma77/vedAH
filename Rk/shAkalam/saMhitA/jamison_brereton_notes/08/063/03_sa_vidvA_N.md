stuṣé could alternatively be 1st sg. ‘I shall praise’. I interpret it as an infinitive, with Ge, because there has been so far no personal reference to the poet.

But this is not a strong argument, esp. since “we” make an appearance in vs. 4.

The mention of the opening of the Vala cave may allude to the dawn, and therefore to the dawn happening at this sacrifice now.
