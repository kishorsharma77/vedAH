The overall structure of the vs. is the first issue to address. The first hemistich begins with a rel. clause (in a) with accented verb ápiprata; the second pāda begins with another accented verb, ámandata, which can owe its accent either to its pāda-initial position or to being part of the rel. cl. of pāda a. I choose the former interpr., making b into the main cl. of the vs. (so also Hoffmann, Injunk., 244). Ge and WG choose the second, with ab containing two parallel rel. clauses. Since the 2nd hemistich consists of a dep. cl. beginning with yád in c, with its accented verb yámat in d, this leaves the vs. without a main cl. WG remedy this by providing a main cl.

frame “Zur Stelle (war er) …” This posited main clause consists entirely of the preverb ā́that begins pāda a (see their n.), a slender reed indeed. Offhand I cannot think of any other examples where a preverb by itself constitutes a clause. This interpr. is esp. unlikely because ā́is an extremely common preverb with √pṛ / prā ‘fill’, and its default interpr. here is as a preverb in tmesis with ápiprata.

This structural question is connected with the problem of yámat in the yád cl.

of the 2nd hemistich. This form should be a subjunctive to the root aor., but it is difficult to construe it as such, viewed in conjunction with the augmented imperfects of ab. In order to hold onto the subjunctive interpr., Hoffmann (Injunk., 244) takes cd as a purpose cl. (“Der Freigebige … berauschte sich …. auf dass ihm … Uśanā … die tausendspitzige Waffe reiche”), but Indra doesn’t drink soma so that Uśanā will give him a weapon, but does so at the same time and occasion when Uśanā gives him the weapon (see, e.g., I.121.12). WG’s “Zur Stelle (war er)” is obviously designed to provide a better pragmatic foundation for the purpose cl. (see their n.), but I have just treated the weakness of their interpr. I therefore think that yámat here has to be a nonce injunction with preterital value, rather than the subjunctive it appears to be.

The pivotal form that allowed this reanalysis is 3rd pl. yaman. This form is morphologically ambiguous: it could be a subjunctive or an injunctive. Although those forms are normally differentiated by the grade of the root (e.g., subj. gáman versus injunc. gmán), a zero-grade injunc. *imán is too radical and would be blocked.

In fact, yaman, which occurs 4x (once as a rep.), is only found in mā́prohibitives and therefore must be an injunc. in every case. To this form, which could also be injunc.

to a thematic stem, a 3rd sg. thematic-type injunc. yámat can be backformed.
