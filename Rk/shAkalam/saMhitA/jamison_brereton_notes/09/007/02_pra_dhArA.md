In keeping with his interpr. of vs. 1, Lü (238) sees the “great waters” (mahī́r apáḥ) here as the celestial waters -- again not necessary, since the ritual soma is mixed with water after it traverses the filter.

mádhvaḥ could in principle be construed either with dhā́rā (“stream of honey”) or agriyáḥ, as in the publ. tr. Though both Ge and Re opt for the former, mádhvo agriyám in VII.92.2 suggests the latter, as does the parallel expression vācó agriyáḥ in the next vs. (3a; also IX.62.25). So Lü (238). Both Ge and Lü take dhā́rā as instr. sg. (Ge: “Mit dem Strome …”). (Old hesitates but slightly favors instr.) This is certainly possible, though not necessary: nom. dhā́rā and nom. agriyáḥ can have different genders because they belong to two different NPs in apposition to each other. In any case, none of these minor differences in interpr. have any real implications.
