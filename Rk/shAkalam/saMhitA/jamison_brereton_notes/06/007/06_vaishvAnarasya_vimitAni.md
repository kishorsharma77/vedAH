This vs. continues, and clarifies, the theme of the 2nd hemistich of vs. 5.

Although Agni as Vaiśvānara is often identified with the sun and although several of the passages cited immediately above, ad 5d, identify Vaiśvānara with the “beacon of the days,” here Agni Vaiśvānara is separate from the sun (as indeed he was in 5cd), which is his eye (vaiśvānarásya … cákṣasā) and which is further characterized as “the beacon of the immortal one” (amṛ́tasya ketúnā), taking up the ketú- of 5d, which Agni found. The sun “measures out the backs of heaven” by crossing the sky on his daily passage.

In c the referent of tásya in the phrase tásya … mūrdháni “on his head / on the head of this one” is not specified and could either be the sun, as expressed by the instr. of ab, or Agni Vaiśvānara. It is surely the latter, however: mūrdháni echoes the first word of the hymn, mūrdhā́nam, which refers to Agni himself as the “head of heaven.” And the víśvā bhúvanāni “all creatures” who take their place on this head are a twist on Agni’s epithet vaiśvānará- ‘belonging to all men’, which dominates this hymn.

On the formation of visrúh-, which occurs only here and in V.44.3, see comm. ad V.44.3, where I connect it (as a number of others do) to √ru(d)h ‘grow’. In our passage this etymological connection is actualized in the figure ruruhuḥ … visrúhaḥ, and the vegetative image is further anchored by the simile vayā́iva “like twigs.” With Re (and Kellens, Noms. rac., 82-83), I think the ‘outgrowths’ are Agni’s flames, but unlike those two I would not translate visrúhaḥ as ‘flames’: it’s a metaphor.
