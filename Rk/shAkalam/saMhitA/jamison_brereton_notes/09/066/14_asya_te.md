It is difficult to render the vs.-initial ásya te lit. “of this here you”; the demon.

essentially exists as a prop for the enclitic te and a way to emphasize the 2nd ps. pronoun.

I do not know what the difference is between sakhyá- and sakhitvá-, or if any difference is meant. The former is far better attested and has a fuller paradigm, well distributed across cases and numbers (sg. and pl.); the latter is almost confined to the nom./acc. sg. (with 2 occurrences of the loc. sg.). In any case the vs. comes out a little flat: we want your comradeship because it will benefit us. The poet may have been trying to distract attention from this flatness by varying the derivational realization. It’s also worth noting that pāda a is also found in IX.61.29 without sakhitvá- in context and pāda c is found in IX.31.6 without sakhyá- in context.

In his endearingly crusty way, Bloomfield (RR ad IX.31.6) pronounces our vs. “arrant nonsense”: “pādas a and c, borrowed from good quarters, show that the stanza is irresponsible patchwork.” This seems rather harsh, but probably results in part from his interpr. of íyakṣantaḥ as the desid. of √yaj, rather than the now generally accepted derivation from √(n)aś; see comm. ad VI.21.3. Attributing it to √yaj produces a participial phrase in b that has nothing to do with sakhyé in a: “In thy friendship we, sacrificing with thy help, do we, O Indu, thy friendship crave” (Bl’s tr., which justifies his “arrant nonsense” judgment). Whereas a connection with √(n)aś sets out the reason we want your comradeship—we stand to gain from it—and makes ab a unified expression.
