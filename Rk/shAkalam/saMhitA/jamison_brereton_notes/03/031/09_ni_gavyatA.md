Ge’s suggestion that this vs. concerns the Aṅgirases’ Sattra, a months-long ritual, seems completely convincing. Note the verb sedur ‘they sat’ in pāda a and the nominal sádanam ‘sitting’ in c. I am less convinced by his interpr. of c (fld. by Re, WG), that this Sattra is frequently (bhū́ri) repeated now, though I admit that both the hic-et-nunc prn. idám and the particle nú might support his view. I prefer Lü’s interpr.

(Varuṇa, 511, fld. by Schmidt 168), who takes bhū́ri as ‘long’ and the hemistich as a further description of the Aṅgirases’ Sattra in the Vala myth.

My interpr. of d (based on Lü and Schmidt) deviates further from Ge (Re, WG). All of the latter take yéna … ṛténa as coreferential and the equivalent of …

*ṛtáṃ, yéna -- that is, *ṛtám in the main cl. as antecedent to yéna. The main cl. *ṛtám
would be an appositive to sádanam “the Session, (that is,) the ṛtá by which they …” However, I separate the two instr. in d and take the antecedent of yéna to be sádanam (“the Session by which …”), leaving ṛténa to mean ‘by/through truth’ as so often.

They also take māsā́n as the obj. of ásiṣāsan (“they sought to win the months”), but this acc. pl. can easily be an acc. of extent of time (again, as so often), and the true object of their desire to win can be supplied as the cows.
