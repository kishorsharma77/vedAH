The opening abhí priyā́ṇi pavate … nā́māni is reminiscent of IX.62.25=66.1=107.23 pávasva … abhí víśvāni kā́vyā “purify yourself towards all products of poetic skill,” where in all cases I take the abhí ACC phrase as goal. See comm. ad IX.62.25. The point is that Soma in the course of his ritual preparation aims his journey towards the place where the hymns are being recited - in this case the hymns mentioning his names and epithets. Like the other RVic gods (esp. Indra), Soma “grows strong” on praise. In contrast, Ge thinks that the “names” are “die Formen oder Phasen des zubereiteten Tranks”; sim. Lü (526) “Erscheinungsformen.” I don’t see why the physical needs to replace the verbal here, esp. given the emphasis on the verbal, and indeed on names, in the next vs. Properly speaking, yahváḥ should be part of the main cl., in order for yéśu to take its proper place in the rel. cl. A slightly revised tr. would be “Delighted, the youthfully exuberant one purifies himself towards his own dear names, upon which he grows strong.” The 2nd hemistich implicitly contrasts the heavenly soma with the earthly, ritual one of ab, as so often.

The adj. vícakṣanaḥ ‘wide gazing’, characterizing Soma, is a partial match for acc. víṣvañcam ‘facing in many directions’, used of the sun’s chariot.
