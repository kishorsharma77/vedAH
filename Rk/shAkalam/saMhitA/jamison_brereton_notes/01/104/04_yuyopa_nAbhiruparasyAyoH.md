Likewise consult the publ. intro. for my interpr. of this verse.

In b prá … tirate, whose regular object is ā́yus- ‘lifetime’ (which I supply here), plays off the name Āyu in the previous pāda. With Old and WG I supply ‘dawns’ with pū́rvābhiḥ, on the basis of V.48.2, adduced by Old.

I supply Sarasvatī in c, because the only other occurrence of vīrápatnī (VI.49.7) refers to Sarasvatī.
