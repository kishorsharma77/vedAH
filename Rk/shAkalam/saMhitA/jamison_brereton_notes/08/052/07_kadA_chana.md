Though the verse starts like its counterpart, 51.7, with kadā́caná [2ND SG.], the verses go off in different directions.

The elements in the second hemistich can be variously distributed. Like most interpretors I take hávanam as the mortals’ call to the gods and the subject of ā́ tasthau, but I take indriyám as modifying it, meaning (unusually for this stem) ‘destined for / appropriate to Indra’ (so, approximately, Old), while Ge instead makes it the goal and supplies “name”: “… bis zu deinem indrischen unsterblichen (Namen) im Himmel…” This is not impossible, but I do not understand why our invocation would go to Indra’s name. I supply bhúvanam or similar with amṛ́tam.

The vocative “fourth Āditya” (túrīyāditya) is somewhat surprising, but as Old suggests it must identify Indra as fourth, after the standard trio Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman. Why Indra is called an Āditya in this particular context is not clear to me.
