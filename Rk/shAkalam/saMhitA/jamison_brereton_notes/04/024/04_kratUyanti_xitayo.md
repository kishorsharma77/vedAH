The ‘winning of the flood’ (árṇasātau) presumably refers, as Ge, etc., point out, to the battle to control water resources, esp. dwelling places near water.

Most tr. give a more neutral rendering of ávavṛtranta, but my “have rolled together” is meant to convey the deeply entwined, rough-and-tumble quality of pitched battle (and, perhaps, the actual rolling of chariots onto the battlefield).
