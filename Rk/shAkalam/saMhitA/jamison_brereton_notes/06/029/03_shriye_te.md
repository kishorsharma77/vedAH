The content of this vs. is somewhat illuminated by the similar account of the Śuṣṇa battle and the theft of the sun’s wheel in IV.16.9-14, esp. vs. 12, as Old and Ge point out.

The tenses and moods of this vs. are ill-assorted; for various views, see Old, Hoffmann (Injunk. 190-91), Klein DGRV II.101-2. The first issue is the impv.

yudhya ordering Indra to fight a mythological enemy long since defeated. Old reports with apparent, though not full-voiced, approval, Gr’s (Üb) suggestion to read injunc.

yudhyaḥ, but later points out that the gods are often urged to do a deed that actually happened in the past -- hence the transmitted impv. yudhya would be perfectly fine.

(And Gr Wö lists the form thus.) At the beginning of c, dáśa is taken by Ge (fld. by Klein; see also Gr Wö) as an impv. to √daṃś ‘bite’ (in the sense ‘stachle’ [spur on, goad]), with ‘horses’ supplied as obj. Given the discrepancy between the root meaning and the sense suggested here, as well as the absence of an expressed object, it seems best to follow Old (who cites Gr’s Üb. [though curiously Gr in the Wö interprets it as Ge does]) and Hoffmann and take dáśa as the numeral, referring to the companions of Śuṣṇa (like the thousands [sahásrā] mentioned in IV.16.12 containing śúṣṇam aśúṣam … kúyavam as here).

A new clause begins in the middle of pāda c, introduced by ádha and containing the injunc. muṣāyaḥ, which is hard to harmonize with the impv. (yudhya) that precedes it. Ge (fld. by Klein) interpr. the injunc. as a functional impv., coordinated with the impv. he sees in dáśa; cf. Klein “Goad (thy horses) … and steal the wheel of the sun.” Whereas Hoffmann takes the injunc. as “generell”: “Da stiehlst du die Scheibe der Sonne,” further specified in his discussion with “da … stiehlst du (immer wieder), hast du die Fähigkeit (Eigenschaft) zu stehlen.” Neither the impv. nor the general reading seems satisfactory: although some injunctives function as imperatives, that usage is limited to a few stems, generally the root aorists dāḥ, dhāḥ, and bhūḥ. As for the “general” interpr., although it might make sense to say of someone (even Indra) “you have the capability/propensity to steal,” it is stretching what “general” means to apply it to a single and quite specific event: “you have the capability/propensity to steal the sun’s wheel.” The publ. tr. follows the presential rendering of Hoffman: “you steal” (though without the “general” nuance). I now think this is incorrect and that the injunctive simply expresses the past here. The first part of the vs. vividly evokes the attack on Śuṣṇa by imagining it before our eyes, with the speaker urging Indra to enter the fight. But the narrative then reverts to a recital of the mythical past. I would therefore alter the tr. to “So then you stole the wheel of the sun.” The last VP in the vs. brings up a different issue. The transmitted Saṃh. text is áviverápāṃsi, analyzed by the Pp. as áviveḥ rápāṃsi, from an assumed underlying

*áviver rápāṃsi with simplification of the double r across word boundary by the
well-known sandhi rule. This interpr. is followed by Ge and Klein; cf. Klein “Thou has set aright the damages.” But as in I.69.8 (q.v.) I follow Old (accepted also by Hoffmann) in reading áviver ápāṃsi, with ápas- ‘labor’. This does not require alteration of the Saṃh. text.
