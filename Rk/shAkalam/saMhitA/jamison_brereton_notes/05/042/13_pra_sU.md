The phrase návyasīṃ jā́yamānam “the newer (hymn), being born,” with comparative of ‘new’ and the pres. participle seems designed to refer to the current hymn in the process of composition.

Tvaṣṭar is both the possessor and producer of “all forms” (cf. I.13.10 tváṣṭāram … viśvárūpam) and the father of a being called Viśvarūpa (likewise viśvárūpa- ‘possessing all forms’ (cf. II.11.19, X.8.9 tvāṣṭrá- viśvárūpa- with the patronymic tvāṣṭrá-). In one sense the second hemistich seems to be an attempt to reconcile these two aspects: Tvaṣṭar as a lone creator god, the fashioner of all forms, “(ex)changing his forms” (rūpā́minānáḥ) as sole agent -- but doing so “bulging (?) in the body of his daughter” (āhanā́duhitúr vakṣánāsu)(if that’s what it means), which introduces a sexual (indeed incestuous) element that would be appropriate to the fathering of a son. On the one hand, we seem to have a model of primitive embryology, with the fetus changing and developing within its mother’s womb; on the other hand, the half-vs. mirrors the later Sanskrit notion that the father enters the body of the mother and is reborn as the son. Unlike the incest of Dyaus and of Prajāpati, the story of Tvaṣṭar’s incest (if that’s what this is) is otherwise muted and not securely attested elsewhere.

The meaning and etymology of the s-stem āhanás- are deeply uncertain. In context it seems to mean ‘swollen, bulging, luxuriant, lubricious’. As for the etym. see EWA s.v. and, for a recent etymological attempt, Kulikov in the Lubotsky Fs.

(2018). The word has gained a certain notoriety in IEist discourse because it is argued that it preserves the old suffixal accent of s-stem bahuvrīhis (see Stüber, sstems [2002] 27, 189). However, it is dangerous to pin the reconstruction of a whole category on a word whose meaning, structure, and etymology are radically uncertain.

For disc. of the word, as well as demolition of the accentual theory it is supposed to support, see JL “αἰνοπαθής.” On vakṣáṇā- ‘belly’ as a pl. tantum, see comm. ad X.27.16.
