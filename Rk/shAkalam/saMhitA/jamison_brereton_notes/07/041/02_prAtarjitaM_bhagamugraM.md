On the first pāda of this vs. see comm. immediately above.

The referent of the repeated rel. prn. yá- (b, c, d) is Bhaga, and we therefore might expect that in the sequence in d yám bhágam the latter word refers to the god (as the same acc. does in pāda a and in 1c). But instead it is almost surely merely a pun on the divine name and its first reading is as the homonymous (and of course etymologically identical) common noun ‘portion’ -- though the more usual word for ‘portion’ is bhāgá-. At best it could be read twice, once as the name, once the common noun (“which Bhaga … portion …”). If we follow the Pp., bhágam must be part of the quotation ended by íti, because the other word in the quotation, bhakṣi, is read by the Pp. as unaccented and cannot therefore be initial in the quotation/clause.

In principle, however, the sandhi form bhakṣī́ti could contain both an accented particle íti and an accented bhakṣí, contra the Pp. which could -- and should -- then be the only word in the quotation.

Part -- but only part -- of the solution depends on how we analyze the verb form. Old and Ge inter alia (e.g., Scar 157) take it as a 1st sg. middle, which could therefore be accented, since medial s-aor. forms take accent on the ending (cf. bhakṣīyá, bhakṣīmahí) -- though it need not be. (Indeed no one, as far as I know, rejects the unaccented Pp reading in favor of *bhakṣí.) I follow the view of Sāy. (also Gr, Wh. [AV tr. III.16.2], Narten [p. 179 n. 512] inter alia [see Old’s reff.]), that it is a 2nd sg. act., that is, a -si impv. (ultimately derived from the act. s-aor. subjunctive; cf. bhakṣat), where we should expect root accent (*bhákṣi) if the form were to be accented. Because there seems to be universal agreement that bhakṣi is unaccented, the divergent interpretations of the morphology do not affect the interpr. of where the quotation begins, but it seems worthwhile to point out the possible interpr. not taken.

One reason I prefer the -si impv. interpr. is that the 1st sg. interpr. might impose more modality on an injunctive than we might expect: cf. Ge’s “ich möchte … teilhaft werden” (though Scar’s “ich bekomme …” avoids modality). The context favors a request, rather than a statement of accomplishment. 67
