The subject shifts without overt signaling from Indra to the man who ritually serves Indra. Indra himself features in the verse as the yavīyudh- ‘everbattling’ one, who is worth a thousand others.

prāvargá- is found in the RV only here, but cannot be separated from suprāvargám (which I tr. ‘well in advance’) in VIII.22.18 suprāvargáṃ suvī́ryam (cf. our prāvargám … suvī́rye). There is also dāsá-pravarga- in I.92.8, which I tr. ‘with alien-slaves as its forelock’. The prā- … kṛṇute also reminds us of vs. 5a prá cakre ‘put forward’. It is difficult to arrive at a consensus translation for these forms; although all share the sense that the item in question is in front, it is difficult to assess the contribution of the -vargá- element (much less what connection it might or might not have with the Pravargya ritual). My “with a good twist” was an attempt to render the root value of √vṛj (cf. suvṛktí-), but I am not now sure that it was a happy choice.
