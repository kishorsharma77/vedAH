samóham is derived by Gr (/MonWms) from sám √ūh ‘push together’. But √ūh does not have a full-grade oh in Vedic and is plausibly related to √vah (see EWA s.v., with lit.). Better to analyze as sa-móham and derive it from √muh ‘be confused’. The same analysis should probably be applied to the differently accented samohé in I.8.6.
