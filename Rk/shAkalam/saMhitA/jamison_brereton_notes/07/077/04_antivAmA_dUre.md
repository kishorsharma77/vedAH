intro. Notably, the lexical chaining stops here as well.

In pāda a ánti- ‘nearby’ contrasts with dūré ‘in the distance’, though the first is in a cmpd. and the latter is not. The ‘away’ / ‘here’ contrast is also found in c, though yāváya means ‘keep away’ without benefit of preverb or adverb, while ā́ serves for ‘here’. The objects of the antithetical pairs are similar in the two pādas: “(bring) nearby” takes -vāma- ‘valuable things’ (a), váśuni ‘goods’ (c); “keep/send away” amítram ‘foe’ (a), dvéṣaḥ ‘hatred’ (c). Re comments similarly. ánti- may also implicitly refer back to the semantically similar úpa opening the first vs. and mark the beginning of the 2nd section of the hymn. For the complementary opposition ánti / dūrá- in a similar passage, cf. IX.78.5 jahí śátrum antiké dūraké ca yáḥ “Smash the rival nearby and the one who is in the distance.” The VP dūré amítram ucha “dawn the foe into the distance” displays an apparent transitive sense of √vas ‘dawn’. This transitive sense is otherwise limited to ápa √vas ‘dawn (X) away’, as in nearby VII.81.6 uṣā́uchad ápa srídhaḥ “Dawn dawns away failures” (=I.48.8; cf. VII.104.23, VIII.47.18). In our passage the locational adverb dūré ‘in the distance’ fills the role of the preverb ápa ‘away’, a point also made by Re. Baum’s interpr. (Impv. in RV, 164) of amítram as an acc. of goal, in the sense “‘illuminate the enemy (when he is) far away,’ i.e. prevent him from hiding,” is unlikely, and he does not mention the ápa √vas passages.
