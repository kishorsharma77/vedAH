This is the last vs. of the first part of the hymn (see publ. intro.), at least by content, though the next vs. is also in trimeter meter, and it has a typically eclectic group of addressees and divine name-checks.

Pāda b could be simply a nominal sentence: “H+E (are) kindly to us,” but the hortatory cast of the 2nd hemistich makes this unlikely.

Pūṣan probably makes his appearance here because he watches over roads and journeys.

The 2nd singular impv. rákṣā beginning d has no obvious subject. The voc. immediately preceding it, at the end of c, is pl. ṛṭāvṛdhaḥ, as are the other vocc. in pāda a. The only available sg. is pūṣā́in c, but he is subj. of a 3rd ps. impv. The pāda is identical to nearby VI.71.3d, where the sg. Savitar is the addressee, and it was presumably adapted from there, as Re (EVP) notes. As the last pāda of the apparent hymn-ending vs., it is not surprising that it has an external source and is only loosely attached.
