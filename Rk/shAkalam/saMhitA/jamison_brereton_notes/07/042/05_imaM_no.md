The adhvarám of pāda a echoes adhvarásya in 1d and provides a faint ring, since the last vs. (6) is extra-hymnic.

In the publ. tr. in c the verb sadatām is taken as a sg. impv. with Agni as subject. At best, this would be a middle 3rd sg. (though tr. as a 2nd ps.), to a stem, and indeed a root, that is otherwise relentlessly active. This is just an error. The form must be a 3rd du. act. impv., with Night and Dawn (the decoupled dual dvandva náktā … uṣā́sā) as subj. -- as is the standard interpr. (Gr, Ge, Re). The tr. should be emended to “Let Night and Dawn sit here on the ritual grass.” What this is meant to convey is another question, since times of day do not usually have a physical presence at the ritual and it is hard to conceive Night and Dawn sitting on the barhis.

For the “repair” of this image in the next hymn, see comm. ad VII.43.3. The ultimate reference is probably to the daily offering to Agni at the two twilights (later called the Agnihotra).
