As Old and Ge point out, mā́nuṣā should not be a fem. nom. sg. with dhī́ḥ, since the fem. stem is well-attested mā́nuṣī. Nonetheless, the standard tr., including Ge though excluding Re, interpret it with dhī́ḥ -- Ge by taking it as shortened from mā́nuṣāṇām at pāda end (some shortening!) and tr. “die menschliche Dichtung” as if it were a simple modifying adjective. I instead take it as neut. pl. and supply ‘lifespans’ (yugā́(ni)), which is commonly found with this adj., including in our 2c.

By my interpr. it expresses extent of time, indicating that poetic inspiration is a constant that will always ensure rewards for men generation after generation. For a similar thought see III.39.2 sanajā́pítryā́dhī́ḥ the “ancient-born, ancestral hymnic vision.” Most interpr. take iṣáṇi as a loc. infinitive with the preceding acc. as obj. (For the most recent disc., see Keydana, Infinitive im Ṛgveda, 195-96.) This may well be possible, but given its isolation and the unclarity of its morphological shape (see esp.

the disc. by Old, Noten), I take it as a simple locative, construing the accusatives in d as Inhaltsakk. with dúhānā in c. In any case it produces a bad cadence (4 light syllables); I do not see an easy repair strategy.
