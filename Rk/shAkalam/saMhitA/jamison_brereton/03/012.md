Indra and Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina.
9 verses: gāyatrī
The poet invites Indra and Agni to drink the soma at the morning soma offering.  The two gods are not only invoked together, but the poet  also ascribes the acts  distinctive of each god to both. After invoking them in the 2nd person in the first  two verses, in the third verse he refers to them in the 3rd person and then, espe
cially in verses 4 and 6, tells of the great deeds that belong to both of them. In  verse 4 they are both “smashers of obstacles,” for while Indra is the “smasher of  obstacles” or “smasher of Vr̥tra,” Agni also burns his way through obstacles (e.g.,  VI.16.34). Indra is the god who famously breaks the fortifications of the Dāsas, but  in verse 6 Agni also destroys enemies’ fortifications, as in III.15.4. In verse 8 “cross
ing the waters” belongs to the two of them as well. As Geldner remarks, this last is probably a reference to a victorious march across rivers that is led by the sacrifice,  represented by Agni, and by warriors, represented by Indra.
