As noted in the publ. intro., the syntax of this vs. is unregulated. However, the sense is quite clear. The first hemistich consists of a rel. clause, whose rel. prn.

and finite verb are both in the 3rd sg.: yáḥ … cíketat “who will keep watch”; it also contains another verbal form, vidádhat, which I take, with Ge and Old, as a pres.

part. nom. sg. m. to the redupl. pres. of √dhā, but which could be, as Old points out, a short-vowel subjunctive (so, “… will regulate … and will keep watch”). (Nothing rides on the choice.) But this happy singular environment is interrupted by a dual nom./acc. (which must be nom. in this case) rā́jānau “two kings,” which is further specified by the two nom. singulars mitró váruṇaḥ. The sense is clearly “which one (of) the two kings, M (or) V …,” but this is not what it says: “which one, the two kings, Mitra, Varuṇa, will keep watch,” leaving the audience to choose what subject, in what number, it prefers.

I take rájasaḥ as the gen. obj. of cíketat (so also Old), in the usual syntactic pattern of verbs of perception, which can take acc. or gen. complements. By contrast, Ge has it dependent on rā́jānāu, but, as Re points out, the two are rather distant, and further I know of no other passages in which rájas- is construed with rā́jan-, although that expression would be appealingly alliterative -- though it is true that M+V are called dhartā́rā rájasaḥ “upholders of the space” in V.69.4.

The second hemistich has no direct syntactic connection to the first, though again it is quite clear what is meant. It contains a 2nd sg. impv. asya ‘hurl’, which must be addressed to the referent of the rel. prn. in ab -- that is, either Mitra or Varuṇa. Although it is common to change person reference even within RVic vss., it is somewhat unusual to do so in this kind of syntagm. In d Re calls the phrase dróghāya cid vácase a bahuvrīhi “défait,” for *droghavacas- [he gives no accent], like drogha-vā́c-. Judging from his tr. “auf den gar verlogenen Anuiden,” Ge seems to agree. But this seems unnec.; the dative targets of the missile in c and d are both s-stem abstracts, rákṣas- ‘demonic power’ and vácas- ‘speech’ respectively. I see no reason to try to manipulate the target in d to be personal. Scar (469) interpr. as I do.
