The Gods have freed from, sinfulness, redeeming the Sun, the Law from darkness and from Grahi. From family sickness, kinsmen's curse, Destruction, from Druh, from Varuna's noose I thus release thee. With spell and prayer I make thee pure and sinless: to thee be both, the Earth and Heaven, auspicious!
