Soma Pavamāna
Ayāsya Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
The hymn is defined by a thematic ring: Soma has his gaze on men in verse 1 and in  the final verse (6) he gazes out on the reward he gives to his human praiser. Soma,

as usual, goes on his purificatory journey through the filter (vss. 1–2) and is mixed  with milk (vs. 3), but unlike many of the recent soma hymns, this one also focuses  on the stage beyond the filter, with striking images in verses 4 and 5.
## 1
Having your gaze on men, purify yourself for exhilaration, for the  pursuit of the gods,
o drop, and for Indra to drink.
## 2
Rush on your mission for us—you spill out for Indra—
rush to the gods for us, your comrades, at will.
## 3
And we anoint you, the ruddy one, with cows for exhilaration.
Open up the doors for wealth for us.
## 4
He has stepped beyond the filter, like a prize-seeking (horse) the
chariot-pole on its course.
The drop plays the lord among the gods.
## 5
His comrades cried out in unison to him as he was playing in the
wood(en vessel), beyond the sheep [=fleece].
To the drop the roars have roared.
## 6
Purify yourself in that stream in which, once drunk, you will gaze out upon an abundance of heroes for your praiser, o drop.
