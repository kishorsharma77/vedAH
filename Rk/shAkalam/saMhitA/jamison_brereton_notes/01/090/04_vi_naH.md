It is unclear from Ge’s ‘aussuchen’ (/WG’s ‘auswählen’) whether they attribute ví … cyantu to √ci ‘pile’ or √ci ‘observe’, since the proposed meaning would require metaphorical stretching for either root. With Gr (and, judging from his ‘dégager’, also Re), I take it to the ‘pile’ root, with the literal sense being ‘pile [obstructions, detritus, etc.] apart or away’, thus ‘clear’, of paths. This idiom is found several times elsewhere of paths: IV.37.7, IV.55.4, VI.53.4 (passages collected also by Ge ad IV.55.4).
