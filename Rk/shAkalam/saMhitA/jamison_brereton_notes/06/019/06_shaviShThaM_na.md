The first hemistich is notable for the superlative etymological figures: double śáviṣṭham … śávaḥ “strongest strength” (or, in fact, triple, since śūra ‘hero’ is ultimately related to these words) and triple ójiṣṭham ójaḥ … ugrám “mightiest mighty might.” The triple etym. connection of the first phrase is better conveyed by Ge’s “Bring uns, du Starker, die stärkste Stärke” than by the publ. tr. Note also that the adjacent words in b ójo abhibhūta “… might, o overpowering one,” though not syntactically connected here, form a bahuvrīhi modifying Indra in the preceding hymn, VI.18.1 abhíbhūti-ojas- ‘of overpowering strength’.
