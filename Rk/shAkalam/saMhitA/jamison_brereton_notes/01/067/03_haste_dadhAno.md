On the idiom áme √dhā see disc. ad I.63.1; this expression must also be considered in relation to Parāśara’s ámaṃ √dhā in the preceding hymn (I.66.7).

Although a tr. like WG “setzt er die Götter in Schrecken” is easier, I do not think we should lose the sense of ‘onslaught’ for áma- by redefining it as ‘panic’ or ‘terror’ in this idiom. Here I think the point is that the leaping flames of Agni put even the gods in his way, even though he is, for the moment, sitting undetected. The first pāda of the hymn (váneṣu jāyúḥ “a conquerer amid the wood”) also implicitly contrasts his martial power with his apparently humble station.
