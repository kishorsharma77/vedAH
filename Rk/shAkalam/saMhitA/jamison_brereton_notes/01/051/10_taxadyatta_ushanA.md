A nice adjacency figure, nṛmaṇo manoyujaḥ.

Ge (/WG) supplies “with strength” with pū́ryamānam ‘being filled’, but Re’s “with soma” (an alternative allowed by Ge in his n.) seems more likely on the basis of other “fill” phrases involving Indra. Esp. apposite is V.34.2, adduced by Ge, where Indra fills his belly with soma while Uśanā offers him a weapon, much as here.

Indra’s exhilaration in the immediately following verse here (11a) also supports the soma interpretation.
