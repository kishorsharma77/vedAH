It’s not clear to me which gods Sūrya is supposed to pursue. The last descriptor, agnijihvā́ḥ ‘having Agni as tongue’ suggests it is, in fact, all the gods, since they all receive the oblation through him.

Note the juxtaposition of ṛtá- and satyá-; a similar of more elaborate ex. is found in the next hymn, VI.51.10 rtádh ̥ ītayo vakmarā́jasatyāḥ.
