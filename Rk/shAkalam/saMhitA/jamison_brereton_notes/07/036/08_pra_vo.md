The NP dhiyó avitā́ram, characterizing Bhaga, reprises the VP dhíyam … avantu in 7b, where the Maruts were the subject.

The phrase sātaú vā́jam in d is somewhat problematic. Ge takes it, without comment, as equivalent to the common vā́jasya sātaú (e.g., VII.21.7) with a genitive: “bei dem Gewinnen des Preises.” Re follows, commenting “seul exemple de sātíavec régime Acc.” But this is the problem: although the dative inf. sātáye regularly takes the acc. (e.g., IX.8.2 sātáye vásūni), the loc. to the same stem never does. And in fact even the dative, when construed with vā́ja-, takes the gen.: vā́jasya sātáye (V.9.7, VI.60.13, IX.7.9, X.93.10). In the one apparent exception, IX.68.7 vā́jam ā́ darṣi sātáye, the acc. is actually object of the main verb. I therefore think that vā́jam here has to be an obj. of prá … kṛṇudhvam, parallel to the divinities and semidivinities in the vs. ### 09
On niṣikta-pā́- see Old and now Scar (306).

I take prajā́yai as a quasi-infinitive. See also X.73.5.
