As noted in the intro., this verse pairs structurally with vs. 3; I therefore take Agni to be the subject, with the verse expressing the kindling of the fire at the time when Indra arrives to receive the morning offering.

The form dṛ́kṣase is isolated, but its grammatical identity is fairly clear (see Narten, Sig. Aor. p. 146): a 2nd sg. mid. s-aor. subj. with the “wrong” grade of the root (expect *darkṣase); it is probably based immediately on the other s-aor. middle form, 3rd pl. indic. adṛkṣata (5x, once accented) of the same metrical shape (minus augment), which always appears final, as does dṛ́kṣase, and usually in dimeter verse as here.

The two beings in pādas ab, one as unexpressed sg. subj. of the verb, one in the instr., are then referred to as a pair in the du. nom. of pāda c, the predicate of an unexpressed nominal sentence “you two are…”
