The standard tr. assume that Night and Dawn are directing themselves towards Vāyu. I think rather that they are simply following each other in the normal daily succession. Since Vāyu comes at dawn, the transition between the two temporal halves is simultaneous with his journey.

On the “two black treasure chambers” (kṛṣṇé vásudhītī), see Bloomfield (RReps ad III.31.17): “The words krṣṇ̥ é and vásudhitī are both dvandva ekaśeṣa 'black (Night) and (Uṣas)' is a way of saying náktoṣā́sā; conversely 'treasure-giving (Morn) and black (Night)' is uṣā́sānáktā. Cf. Berg. i.250.” In other words, kṛṣṇá- is applicable to Night, vásudhīti- to Day, but the two are conflated into a single dual expression.
