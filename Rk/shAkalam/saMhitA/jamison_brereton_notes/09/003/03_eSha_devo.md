Because of their position in the vs., the instr. vipanyúbhiḥ … ṛtāyúbhiḥ appear to be construed with pávamānaḥ, which is nestled between them. However, with Ge and Re I take them with pass. mṛjyate ‘is groomed’ at the end of pāda c. The medial them. pres. pávate is always reflexive (‘purifies oneself’), not passive; when a pass. sense is required, the middle of the IXth Cl. present is used, esp. the part. punāná-. Or, to put it another way, the pávate stem, esp. part. pávamāna-, is syntactically inert; as Re says (ad vs. 2), “Le mot pávamāna semble partout étranger à la syntaxe du v. et se distingue à cet égard de punāná, pūyámāna, pūtá; les exceptions sont de pure apparence.”
