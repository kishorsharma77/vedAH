Like many dānastutis, this one seems to have a bit of sting in its praise.

The poet seems at first to be saying that the Cedis are so lavish in their giving that no one else could follow them, but the 2nd half of the verse warns that all it would take for another man to receive more praise than Kaśu is to give more. Although the mā́ prohibitive of ab is technically applied to other men (“let no one go …”), it’s really an implicit challenge to Kaśu: he can only stop others from going on his path by always giving the most.
