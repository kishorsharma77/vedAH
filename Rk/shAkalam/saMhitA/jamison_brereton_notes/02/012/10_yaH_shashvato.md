The hapax śṛdhyā́m is generally taken as the acc. sg. of a stem śṛdhyā́-, and this is perfectly plausible both morphologically and contextually. However, it might rather be taken as the loc. sg. of a devī́-type -ī-stem śṛdhī́- “does not yield to the vaunter in his vaunting.” This makes somewhat more sense.
