The construction of this vs. is skewed: the first hemistich contains a typical generalizing rel. cl. referring to proper ritual performance (“who[ever] will yoke …”). It is couched in the 3rd sg. and contains a pres. subjunctive (yunájat). In the 2nd hemistich, pāda c contains another 3rd sg. rel. cl., this time with a pres. indic. (or possibly subj.) (minā́ti), but without a ritual focus, and pāda d contains a 1st sg.

optative that does relate to the ritual (vavṛtyā́m). This ill-assorted trio of clauses has been variously treated. Ge thinks that both rel. clauses have gods as subject, though not necessarily the same god (see n. 4), and that at least the rel. cl. of c has aryamáṇam in d as referent of the rel. prn. Re, mostly flg. Sāy., takes a pious human as subject of ab and supplies a main cl. with it. I think rather that d provides the main cl. for ab, with c a distinct rel. cl. dependent on d, and that there is a switch of reference between the 3rd sg. yáḥ … yunájat of the first hemistich and 1st ps. vavṛtyām of d: “I” am the embodiment of the proper ritual actor as defined in ab. The rel. cl. of c is quite distinct and does indeed depend on aryáman- in d; the god I wish to bring here to my ritual is the one who can neutralize the battle fury of my (and his) enemy.

Switch of reference between 3rd ps. and 2nd ps., even within a single vs., is extremely common when referring to gods, and I see no reason why a similar switch between 3rd and 1st would not be possible when referring to the poet/ritual officiant. For a 1st ps. version of the 1st pāda, cf. I.82.6 yunájmi te bráhmaṇā keśínā hárī (also III.35.4, VII.19.6).

dhāyú- is a hapax. Gr glosses ‘durstig’, connecting it to √dhā ‘suckle’. Old suggests, quite doubtfully, that it belongs rather to √dhāv ‘run’, and this suggestion underlies Ge’s ‘rennlustig’; see also AiG II.2.470, where it is explained as showing an exchange between -v- and -y-. EWA s.v. (rightly) rejects this root affiliation, in favor or one suggested by Gotō (1st Kl. 179 n. 311) to √dhan1 ’id.’. Re tr. ‘riches en dons’, but suggests an association with dhā́yas- ‘nourishment, sustenance’, bringing us back to Gr’s and indeed Whitney’s (Roots) root etym. to √dhā ‘suckle’. My ‘seeking fodder’ reflects the same association.

Note the faint phonological figure of (b) suráthā śūra dhā(yu) / d su(k)rát(um).

I follow JPB (Ādityas, 171-72) in taking aryáman- here as a descriptor of Indra. As Brereton points out, it makes no sense for Aryaman to appear when the poet is seeking to attract Indra. Moreover, the action of pāda c, confounding battle fury, is much more appropriate for Indra (cf., e.g., nearby VII.18.16 índro manyúm manyumyò mimāya), who is also the most common referent for the adj. sukrátu- ‘very resolute’.
