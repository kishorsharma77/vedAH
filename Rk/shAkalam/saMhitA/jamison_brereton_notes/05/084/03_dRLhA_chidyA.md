The first half of this verse restores to us the familiar steady, sturdy Earth of vs. 1, while the second half identifies the special circumstances that held in vs. 2.

Because it is made up of two subordinate clauses, it must be attached to the previous verse and the 2nd person referent must be the same. This verse, with its straightforward diction and balanced construction, provides the answer to those dullards in the audience who failed to solve the implicit challenge of vs. 2.

The standard tr. all supply a verb for vidyútaḥ -- e.g., WG “wenn … die Blitze (blitzen) …” -- but I don’t see why the lightning bolts can’t ‘rain’ -- in particularly violent thunderstorms lightning flashes can seem to come as thick and fast as raindrops.

Note that ‘earth’ is reunited with her usual formulaic companion ‘heaven’ in the final pāda of the hymn. It should be kept in mind that this is the only hymn dedicated only to Earth in the RV, instead of to Heaven and Earth.
