Indra  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
8 verses: gāyatrī 1–4; triṣṭubh 5, 7–8; jagatī 6  
This hymn is also an addition to the Indra collection. Entirely parallel to III.28 (a  hymn to Agni), it concerns the offering of a sacrificial cake at each pressing of the  soma sacrifice, with each pressing characterized by a different meter. The Morning  Pressing is the subject of verses 1–4; the Midday Pressing (amply represented in  other hymns of this cycle: see the introduction to III.51) merits only one verse (5),  and the Third Pressing is likewise mentioned only once (vs. 6). The remaining two  verses appear to have a more general application.
