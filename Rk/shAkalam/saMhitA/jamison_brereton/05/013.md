Agni
Sutambhara Ātreya
6 verses: gāyatrī
Like the previous hymn, which is also attributed to Sutambhara, this hymn empha sizes the praise song offered to Agni, which causes Agni to grow and to perform  the sacrifice as the Hotar. The course of the hymn follows that growth of Agni. In  verse 1 the sacrificers are just beginning to kindle Agni. He then spreads wide (vs.  4) and is made strong (vs. 5), until finally, in the last verse, he encompasses the gods.
## 1
Chanting, we invoke you; chanting, we would kindle you,
chanting, o Agni, for your help.
## 2
For Agni we will conceive a praise song, an effective one today for him  who touches heaven,
for the god, as we seek goods.
## 3
Agni is pleased at our songs—he the Hotar, who is here among the sons  of Manu.
He will perform sacrifice to the divine race.
## 4
You, o Agni, are spread wide as the pleasing Hotar to be chosen.
Through you they stretch out the sacrifice.
## 5
You, o Agni, best prizewinner, do the inspired poets make strong when  you are well praised.
Give us an abundance of heroes.
## 6
O Agni, like a rim the spokes, you surround the gods.
I reach toward your shimmering generosity.
