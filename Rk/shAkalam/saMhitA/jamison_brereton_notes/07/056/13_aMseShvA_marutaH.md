This vs. has no finite verbs, but three predicated tense-stem participles: pf.

upaśiśriyāṇā́ḥ (b), aor. rucānā́ḥ (c), pres. yáchamānāḥ (d), in a hymn already well provided with such (see 10d, 11d).

As for upaśiśriyāṇā́ḥ, although pf. participles regularly have preterital value, the middle pf. of √śri is presential (Kü 527-28) and stative, and this form contrasts with the far more common ppl. śrita- ‘set’ -- hence my “being set,” though this rendering somewhat undercuts the stative value.

In cd it is possible that only one of the participles is predicated, and in fact the publ. tr. renders pāda c as wholly a simile. However, this hemistich could contain two independent predications: “(you are) shining like …; (you are) holding yourselves …” In any case there is an unsignaled change of subject between the hemistichs: in ab the ornaments (nom. khādáyaḥ, rukmā́ḥ) are the grammatical subjects, while in d the Maruts must be supplied because the participle yáchamānāḥ seems to assume an animate subject. Pāda c is ambiguous: either the brilliants (rukmā́ḥ) or the Maruts can be shining. The etymological relationship between rukmā́ḥ in b and the part. rucānā́ḥ in c might suggest that c goes with b. However, in my publ. tr. I have privileged the hemistich boundary and supplied the Maruts as subj.

of c (as do Ge and Re), but the other interpr. is certainly possible. One argument for the standard interpr. might be that the subjects of medial participles to √ruc (wellattested rócamāna-, as well as rucāná-, rurucāná-, rórucāna-) are generally gods.
