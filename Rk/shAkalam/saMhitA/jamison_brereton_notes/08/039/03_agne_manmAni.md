prá cikiddhi presents the usual problem of forms of √cit: does this fall in the intransitive ‘appear, be perceived’ range or I/T ‘perceive’? I have opted for the latter, since Agni is regularly called prácetas-, which I interpr. as ‘discerning, provident’. But Ge and Re go for the former, which is certainly not impossible and might be supported by ciketa in 5a.
