Alliteration continues, with ví … víṣvak (a), śuce śúcayaḥ (b), návagvā vánā vananti (cd). The first two are etymological figures; in the third, intricately structured one, vánā vananti is not, but mimics one.

Flg. Ge (fld. by Re), I assume that the Navagvas are in an unmarked simile: the flames break and overcome the woods as the Navagvas broke Vala. The gapping of the simile marker ná would not be surprising in the -na-rich environment of the figure noted above: návagvā vánā vananti: we might have expected divyā́*ná návagvā, and haplology would not be surprising.

The identity of the root found in tuvi-mrakṣá- is disputed; see EWA s.v. MARC, with √mṛc ‘harm’, √mṛj ‘wipe’, and √mṛś ‘touch’ all possibly in play. √mṛc ‘harm’ seems the most likely to me. The Schwebeablaut outcome -mrakṣ- is standard when -kṣ- ending the root syllable would yield a super-heavy cluster *-rkṣ. Cf. drakṣyati (not *darkṣyati) to √dṛś (see AiG I.212-13). Any of the roots just listed would follow this pattern.
