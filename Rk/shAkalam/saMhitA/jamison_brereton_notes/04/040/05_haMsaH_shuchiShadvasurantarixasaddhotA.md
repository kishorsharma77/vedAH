After the increasingly furious speed and frenzied activity in the last vss., culminating in the three intensives (two in the preceding hemistich, 4c, d), this vs. brings it to a shockingly abrupt stop. Eight cmpds ending in ‘sit’ (-sád-), with a sense exactly opposite to the preceding verbs of motion, decisively halt the movement and impose a state of rest, even inertia. The horse is gone; I explicitly do not think this series of phrases are meant to serve as predicates to an unexpressed Dadhikrā, pace Old and WG. Instead I think these are images of tranquility, of beings in their proper places, a vision of cosmic balance that has no need for the frenetic agitation we have just witnessed. The lack of finite verbs and participles -- all verbal notions being expressed by root-nouns in compound -- models this stasis. The -sád- cmpds give way in the final pāda to 4 -jā́- ‘X-born’ cmpds. I am not entirely sure of their purpose, but I think they sketch (however incomplete) the sources of the entities in the cosmos.

And we end with the single word ṛtám ‘truth’, which, perhaps, incorporates it all, beyond which nothing more is needed and no motion required.
