Ge suggests that pāda a concerns the Vṛtra myth and b the Vala myth, based primarily on ápya- ‘watery’ as a descriptor of the cows in the former. This does not seem to me sufficient evidence, esp. because ápya- is not elsewhere used in connection with the Vṛtra myth. In his n. (6b) Ge appears amenable to a unitary interpr. of ab, as only depicting the Vala myth, as I also take it, though why the cows are ‘watery’ isn’t clear to me. Ge’s alternative explanation, involving X.67.5, does not seem terribly strong. It suggest it may be connected with the waters used in the ritual preparation of soma; see vs. 7.

On abhí √tan see comm. ad VIII.6.25.
