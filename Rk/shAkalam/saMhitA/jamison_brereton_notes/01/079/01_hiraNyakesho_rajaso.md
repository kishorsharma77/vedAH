As Ge notes, the identifications of Agni with sun (a), lightning (b), and fire (cd) are Ludwig’s.

Most comm. take rájasaḥ as a subjective genitive with visāré (most clearly in Ge’s “wenn der Raum sich weitet,” referring to morning in his view). I take it rather to refer to the light of the sun’s rays (his golden hair) spreading through the midspace at dawn.

The third pāda refers to the blazing up of the ritual fire at dawn. The fourth pāda consists only of a simile, couched entirely in the feminine plural. The referent of these feminine adjectives and the point of comparison with Agni are both unclear.

Ge supplies Frauen; Re suggests waters; Old (SBE) waters or dawns. The dawns seem most likely (so also WG), since a sg. dawn already appears in c and dawns make sense in this ritual context. Dawns are called apásas ‘busy’ in I.92.3, also a Gotama hymn, and Uṣas is yáśasvatī in X.11.3. If the feminines are the dawns, the point of comparison may be śúcibhrājāḥ ‘having bright blazing’, since the dawns are also bright. If instead it is one of the adjectives in pāda d (‘glorious’ yáśasvatīḥ, ‘busy’ apasyúvaḥ, or ‘actually present’ satyā́ḥ), we must assume that an original masc. sg. adj. has been attracted into the fem. pl. in the simile - not a problematic assumption.
