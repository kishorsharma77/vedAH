There is no expressed referent in this verse, and Gr (s.v. áśvāvant-, etc.) indicates that it is “we” of vs. 10. However, Ge supplies “soma drops,” esp. on the strength of VIII.49.4 and the fact that vivákṣana- is always used of soma. This seems correct. The question is the meaning and root affiliation of vivákṣana-. Ge tr.

‘redselig machend’, connecting it thus with √vac, while I prefer to take it to √vakṣ ‘become / make strong’, as a transitive -ana-nominal, beside vákṣaṇa- also ‘strengthening’. The connection with √vakṣ is asserted by Old ad X.21.1 (fld. by AiG II.2.198). See also EWA s.v. VAKṢ, esp. p. 487; he does not decide.
