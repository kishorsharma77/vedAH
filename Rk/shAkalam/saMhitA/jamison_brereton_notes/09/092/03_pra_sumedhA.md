The periphrasis in c bhuvát … rántā, with the aor. injunc. (∾ subj.) to √bhū

+ root-accented -tar- stem, must be signaling some special nuance. Ge tr. “Er pflegte … zu verweilen” (is accustomed to); Tichy (168-69) cites his tr. with apparent approbation and characterizes the use of this periphrasis as expressing “eine gewohnheitsmässig wiederholte Handlung.” Her own rendering (pp. 314, 336) is “er pflegte bei allen Darbietungen der Seher haltzumachen.” My own “is one to take his rest” is close to this view, but lays more emphasis on the agentive aspect of the -tarstem.

There is also the question of which sense of √ram is found here, the orig.

‘(come to) rest’ or the developed ‘be content, enjoy’. Re opts for the latter (and see his n.): “qui se complaît …,” but given the emphasis on Soma’s taking his seat (vss.

2-3), it seems best, with Ge (/Tichy), to operate with the first.

Having been called kaví- himself in 2b, Soma now finds himself in the midst of all kā́vya- -- presumably mostly the poetic effusions of the ritual participants, but also the sounds that he made on his journey that afforded him the kaví- title. This joining of different types of kā́vya- may account for the ‘all’.

Ge’s rendering of pāda d is quite free: “Der Kluge macht die fünf Völker zu seinem Gefolge.” Tichy’s (336) is more accurate: “überall bei den fünf Völkern nimmt der Weise seinen Platz ein.” A proper interpr. of this pāda must first recognize that the lexeme is not ánu √yat, pace Gr: there are no other exx. of this supposed combination in the RV (nor any other registered by Mon-Wms). Instead we must be dealing with the fairly common expression jánām̐ánu (I.50.3, 6, 120.11, etc.), though with flipped order, “through(out) the peoples.” The finite verb yatate then has its normal sense ‘take one’s place, ‘arrange oneself’; here the point is that Soma is common to the whole Ārya community, whatever limited place he occupies on the ritual ground.

I render dhī́raḥ as ‘steadfast’ rather than ‘insightful, wise’, because of the emphasis on Soma’s taking his seat.
