The dismissal of Indra and the sending him off home comes rather early in this hymnlet; he just got here (vs. 1) and at that point we urged him to stay put (vs. 2).

Vs. 3 seems to depict the sacrifice proper, and the remaining 3 vss. of this portion of the hymn (vss. 4-6) are an extended farewell. In this vs. the poet seems to be reassuring Indra that if he goes home, he still won’t miss out on anything here: we’ll send Agni to fetch him whenever we press soma.
