atÄ«tape has been subject to a number of conflicting analyses (esp. passive or transitive with unexpressed subj.), but all seem to start with a 3rd sg. with anomalous ending -e. I see no reason why it cannot be a 1st sg., with the proper ending for a thematic medial reduplicated aorist. Although there are no other 1st singulars around, referents are ricocheting around everywhere in this hymn, and as indicated in the publ. intro., the vss. do not show close connections to each other.
