The first pāda depicts the usual effect of Dawn - sending all creatures on their daily business.

ódatī: Though this form appears to be a fem. pres. participle to a Class I present (also in its other occurrence VIII.69.2), such an analysis is formally troublesome, because the feminine stem is weak (-at-ī), though a strong suffix is expected in Class I (e.g., bhávantī-). Moreover, there are no other forms to the putative present *ódati; the standard present is nasal-infix unátti with transitive value.

And ódatī- lacks participial sense: it simply means ‘wet’. It thus seems best to take it as a non-participial -ant- adjective (as járant- is often interpreted). It is worth noting that Whitney (Roots) classifies it as a primary derivative of the root and gives no Class I present and that Gotō makes no mention of it in his monograph on Class I; it is likewise undiscussed in Lowe’s monograph on RVic participles.

As for its meaning here, it is used simultaneously in two senses: the literal one, ‘wet’, referring to the dew characteristic of early morning, and ‘lubricious’, referring to Dawn’s notorious hyperfeminine and sexual qualities, also reflected in 5ab yóṣeva … prabhuñjatī́“giving delight like a maiden.” vājínīvant- (also vājínī-vasu-). This fairly common adjective is obviously a derivative of extremely well-attested vājín- ‘prize-winning (horse)’, itself a possessive adjective formed to vā́ja- ‘prize’. The usual tr. of vājínīvant- are rather attenuated — Gr ‘gabenreich’, Ge (here) ‘du Reichbelohnende’, Debrunner (AiG II.2.

875) ’gabenreich’ — or render it as if it were identical to vā́ja-vant-; so Re. (here) ‘porteuse des prix de victoire’, WG ‘du Rennpreisbesitzende’. By contrast, I feel that both the apparent feminine vājínī and the second possessive suffix (-vant- in addition to -in-) should be noted and I interpret the stem as meaning ‘possessing prizewinning mares’. vājínīvant- is esp. characteristic of Dawn and other female figures (e.g., Sarasvatī), who might be expected to have female animals; though vāj́inī-vasuis almost entirely confined to the Aśvins, those gods are very closely associated with Dawn. Debrunner (AiG II.2.409) instead ascribes the -ī- to “Erweiterung durch -īnach Analogie anderer Wörter,” but doesn’t in this case suggest what other word(s) might be involved.
