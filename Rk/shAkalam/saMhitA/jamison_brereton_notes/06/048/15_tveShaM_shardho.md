This vs. not only continues the identification of Pūṣan with other gods -- here the Maruts, characterized by three different descriptors -- but is syntactically dependent on the previous vs. and its verb stuṣe. It also contains the first mention of Pūṣan himself (pāda b), at the end of the series of identifications.

The three adjectives, tveṣám, tuviṣváṇi, and anarvā́nam, must qualify both the śárdhaḥ ‘troop’ of the Maruts, a neut. acc. s-stem, in the simile, and pūṣáṇam, a masc. acc. -n-stem, in the frame. They seem to split the difference with regard to gender: tveṣám is of course ambiguous as to gender, but tuviṣváṇi is neut. and anarvā́nam masc. The latter is adjacent to masc. pūṣáṇam and separated by the pāda boundary from the neut. phrase, so it is not surprising that it would adopt a masc.

form. Moreover, a proper neut. acc. to this stem would be *anarvá, which almost fatally obscures the 2nd member of the bahuvrīhi. The same substitution of masc. acc. anarvā́nam for expected neut. *anarvá- is found with the very same neut. acc. referent śárdho mā́rutam in I.37.1; cf. comm. there. The expected neut. NA presumably underlies the them. adj. anarvá-; see comm. ad I.185.3. Ge’s and Re’s strategy of taking anarvā́ṇam as only modifying Puṣan (e.g., Ge “den unerreichten Pūṣan, der …”) is thus both unnecessary and probably wrong, given its application (not in a simile) to the Marut troop in I.37.1.
