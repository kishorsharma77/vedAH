Indra  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
8 verses: triṣṭubh, except virāj 2  
The subject of this hymn is the tense ritual standoff and negotiated settlement  between Indra and the Maruts—who both came to Agastya’s sacrifice expecting it  as exclusive offering—a situation also depicted in I.170–171 and the great dialogue  hymn I.165. Although the Anukramaṇī names Indra as sole dedicand, the Maruts  appear in every verse but 4 (though not by name in 6); however, Indra is the only  god addressed—in fact, a vocative indra and a form of the 2nd singular pronoun  appear in each of the first six verses and in the last one (8)—while the Maruts are  always in the 3rd person. There is thus a definite imbalance in their roles.  
The poet begins by flattering Indra and suggesting that he is superior to the  Maruts, but soon implies that the Maruts are getting ahead (vs. 2), and coopera tion is suggested (vss. 1ab, 3). In the middle verses (4–5) the poet begs Indra for  wealth in the sacrificial context (as shown by the priestly gift cow in verse 4), and  this sets the stage for the reconciliation between Indra and the Maruts on the sac rificial ground (vss. 6–7). In the final verse Indra is urged to join with the Maruts in  giving us wealth, and is promised in return that he will be praised by the gods, that  is, by the Maruts, who, however, will also receive praise—from the poet-sacrificers.  
Not surprisingly, since Agastya is the poet, the hymn is full of intriguing difficul ties and studied similes, such as the superficially puzzling maxim in the second half  of verse 3, which turns on the paradox of waters producing dry land (by silting up  the channel?).
