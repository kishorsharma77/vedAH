vy àñjate here responds to sám añje in 1d, though here the verb is reflexive and in the 1st vs. it is transitive but with subject involvement (“I ornament [my own] hymns”). I tr. the verbs slightly differently because the ‘anoint’ sense doesn’t work very well in vs. 1, esp. with the simile, whereas here the etymological figure with añjíbhiḥ ‘unguents’ enforces the more literal sense.

Gr suggests emending mimṛkṣur ‘they rubbed’ to mimikṣur ‘they were fixed/attached’ (accepted by WG), since this verb √myakṣ is used elsewhere of spears in similar contexts. However, ‘rub’ makes fine sense, and the poet may well be playing with a well-known phrase. (This perhaps should give us pause about emending apó to ápo in 1.) Pāda d sākáṃ jajñire svadháyā … “They were born all at once by their own power” -- that the Maruts were self-born is asserted in I.168.2; see also V.87.2.
