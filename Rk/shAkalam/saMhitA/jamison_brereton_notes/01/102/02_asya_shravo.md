The phrase dyā́vākṣā́mā pṛthivī́is striking because pṛthivī́‘earth’ either doubles the less common ‘earth’ word kṣā́mā in the du. dvandva or else serves as the epithet (‘the broad’) it historically was. Indeed because pṛthivī́is grammatically ambiguous (sg. or du.), it could modify both heaven and earth, or it could stand as a second elliptical du. referring to both. The same phrase is found in III.8.8 and, with - bhū́mī rather than kṣā́mā, in X.65.4.

I believe that there is a closer connection between the two halves of the verse than the standard tr. seem to. In my opinion the sun and moon roam alternately in order to provide constant illumination, so that we can see Indra’s “wondrous form lovely to see” (darśatáṃ vápuḥ) and therefore put trust in him, that is, in his existence. Remember that a constant source of worried speculation in the RV is whether Indra exists or not -- a worry that is regularly alleviated by his epiphany on our ritual ground. Here the mere sight of his form will allay our worries and allow us to trust that he exists. Ge attributes the actions of cd just to the fact that Indra is the creator of sun and moon, while Re has us looking at the sky.
