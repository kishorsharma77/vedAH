As often in a mythological context, kaví- by itself seems to refer to Uśanā Kāvya. The previous mention (vs. 5) of Kutsa, often associated with UK, supports this assumption.

arkásātau probably has a double sense. In the ritual context the arká- are the chants (see nearby I.176.5), but in the mythological context supplied by vs. 5 (esp. c), it can be the rays of the sun. So VI.26.3, which contains both UK and Kutsa.

“Making earth a pillow” is surely a euphemism for sending him to “his eternal rest,” “putting him to sleep” among other such sayings. The “woeful womb” of d is a similar expression. Both remind us of 4a “they will now lie in the same womb,” clearly also referring to the grave.

Ge tentatively takes the referent of fem. “three” (tisráḥ) as rivers, and he is followed by Re and WG. Although this identification handles the gender and the fact that the adj. dā́nucitra- (3x) is once used of waters (V.31.6), it runs into the problem that the canonical number of rivers is seven, not three. It is rather the divisions of the world/earth that are regularly triadic; cf. fem. tisráḥ prthiv ̥ ī́ḥ (I.34.8), tisró bhū́mīḥ (II.27.8). Although “bright with drops” may not be the most natural way of referring to the three worlds, I think the numerology trumps the adjective -- which could, in fact, mean ‘bright with gifts’, not ‘drops’.

Ge takes the loc. mṛdhí as parallel to loc. duryoṇé (“in ein böses Nest, in Missachtung”), and as so often he is followed by Re and WG; all of them also take kúyavācam as a PN. But given mṛdhrávācaḥ ‘of scornful speech’ in 2a, it seems better to give kúyavāc- lexical value and construe it with mṛdhí.
