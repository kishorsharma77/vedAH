This verse is in some ways a double of vs. 1. They both begin with prá, and the opening phrases prá manmahe and prá vo mahé rhyme, although the two mahe’s have entirely different analyses. (Note also the mahé máhi play in 2a.) The next phrase of 1a, śavasānā́ya śūṣám, is paralleled in 2b, with the first word identical and sā́ma substituting for the second (both śūṣám and sā́ma referrring to the verbal product offered to Indra). At the beginning of the second pādas, āṅgūṣyàm of 2b matches āṅgūṣám of 1a. “Like the Aṅgirases” (aṅgirasvát) of 1b is picked up by the Aṅgirases themselves áṅgirasaḥ in 2d, and the heavy etymology figure involving the root √arc ‘chant’ is reprised by the participle árcantaḥ in 2d, which opens its pāda just as the finite verb árcāma does in 1d.
