The yád in pāda c has no obvious function. JSK (I.136) interprets the pāda as containing an “X and which Y” construction (“the dusky one and [the one] who is ruddy”), with yád instead of yā́by attraction to the anyád of b. Although this is a tempting way to account for the yád, in addition to the wrong gender the rel. is wrongly positioned: we should expect *yád/yā́ca áruṣī. Ge’s suggestion, that this contains the izafe-like [not Ge’s term] yád that attaches appositives in Vedic prose, may be correct. It’s also worth noting that the structure of c is identical to 12a mātā́ ca yátra duhitā́ca dhenū́, with two nom. singulars conjoined by double ca, a yasubordinator between them, and a dual nom. at the end of the pāda referring jointly to the two singulars. So it is possible that the yád of 11c comes from the model of 12a, where yátra has function.
