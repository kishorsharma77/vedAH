The singular number of both forms of várdhāt (a, b) is worthy of a small note. The subject of the first is the conjoined NP yajñá utá sómaḥ, with 2 singular nouns. As often, the verb agrees with one of them (presumably the nearer one), rather than being in the dual, as would also be possible. In b the subject is the even more complex NP bráhma gíra ukthā́ca mánma, of which the two middle terms are clearly plural (fem. and neut. respectively), while the two neut. -n-stems that bookend the phrase, bráhma and mánma, could be either sg. or pl. Flg. Ge (sim.

Klein DGRV I.198-99), I take the first as sg. and the last as pl., again assuming that the verb agrees with the nearer term, namely bráhma. But it is possible that bráhma is actually pl. and that this is an ex. of the famous but fairly rare construction of a sg.

verb with a neut. pl. subj. Although there is no way to tell, I’m tempted to alter the tr. to pl.: “… the sacred formulations will strengthen,” given the undoubted pl. of the two middle terms and the possible pl. of the last one.

yā́man reprises the same word in 1c, though they have somewhat different meanings.

Although nom. pl. dyā́vaḥ ordinarily refers to ‘heavens’, in this case the context clearly establishes the meaning ‘days’.
