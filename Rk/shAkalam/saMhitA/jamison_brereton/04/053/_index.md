Savitar
Vāmadeva Gautama
7 vereses: jagatī
A relatively straightforward hymn dedicated to Savitar, literally “the Impeller.”  Savitar’s natural control over the rhythms of life—alternatively setting the world  in motion and causing it to settle down—is emphasized, as is his omnipresence in  the cosmos. It is noteworthy that throughout the hymn, even in the requests for  Savitar’s protection and benefits (vss. 1, 6–7), the god stays in the 3rd person, gram
matically distanced from us despite his direct involvement in our affairs.
