As suggested in the intro., this is the last real verse of the hymn, as vs. 10 is a mere variant of 9, and it shows a bit of ring composition: the diváḥ … rocanā́t echoes rocanā́diví of 1c, and if we were to accept Re’s interpr. of 1b tasthúṣaḥ as an ablative, the ablatives átaḥ and rocanā́t would match it grammatically.

This is a rare example of the present middle ṛñj not taking an acc. (see Tucker 2002: 284 n.17, HS 115 “RV rgmín-, ṛgmíya- and ṛñjate”). (JL)
