The verse contains a double 2nd ps. address: implicitly with oblique 2nd ps.

plural prn. vaḥ in pāda a, explicitly with the (singular) voc. phrases in b and the 2nd singular prn. tvám in c. The latter invoke Agni, of course, but the former are most likely, in my opinion, the assembled peoples bringing together their clan fires. (See publ. intro.) Ge suggests rather the “Opferveranstalter” (arrangers of the ritual), which would ordinarily be the default reading of vaḥ in this type of context, but given the political agenda of the hymn, I think it covers a greater number of mortals than simply the ritual officiants. In the publ. tr. I take the vocc. of pāda b with c, which allows the vocatives to be the correct grammatical number and addressed to the correct personage. Strictly speaking, however, this logical division is not syntactically possible, as the vocc. are unaccented and must therefore belong with the preceding clause, ending syā́ma. Nonetheless, the slight violation in the tr. seems justified by sense.
