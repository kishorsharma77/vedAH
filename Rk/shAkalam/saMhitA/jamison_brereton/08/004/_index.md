Indra (1–14), Indra or Pūsan (15–18), Kurun ̣ ̇ga’s  Dānastuti (19–21)
Devātithi Kāṇva
21 verses:  br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas, except  puraüṣṇih 21.
Like the previous hymn, this one is arranged in pragāthas. However, there is less inter nal cohesion in the verse pairs, but more discernible structure in their arrangement in  the hymn. As noted in the Anukramaṇī the hymn falls into three major sections: the  longest (vss. 1–14) devoted to Indra, the next (vss. 15–18) to Pūṣan, and the last (vss.  19–21) a dānastuti. The Indra portion opens with a pragātha (vss. 1–2) listing many

possible sacrificers that Indra might visit, and urging him to come to the Kaṇvas here.  The next four pragāthas (vss. 3–10) form a ring composition, with verses 3/4 and 9/10  matched to each other: Indra as a thirsty animal coming to drink (3a, 10a) and his  assumption of supreme power (4d, 10d). The remaining two pragāthas in this section  (vss. 11–14) command the Adhvaryus to press soma for Indra. The actual content of  the Indra section is conventional: praise of his powers and his help for mortals, invita
tions to journey here and drink the soma, with the invitation becoming more insistent  toward the end. There are almost no mythological references (though the enigmatic  first pāda of 8 seems to refer to the same event as III.32.11, where Indra wears the  earth on his hip), and the usual pleas for gifts are essentially absent, replaced by indi
rection: descriptions of pious men who benefit from Indra.
The Pūṣan section (though the Anukramaṇī offers a choice of Indra or Pūṣan  as the deity, it is clearly Pūṣan) makes the requests for gifts overt, and it serves as a  transition to the dānastuti proper. The penultimate verse of the Pūṣan section (17)  in fact seems to refer to a different Kaṇva poet, Pajra Sāman (see VIII.6.47), who  has his own gifts to praise—as our poet turns to his own in verse 18, apparently  sequestering his share of the cattle in a different pasture. The dānastuti (vss. 19–21)  is fairly straightforward in its first two verses, but the final verse (21) is entirely  opaque, at least to these translators.
