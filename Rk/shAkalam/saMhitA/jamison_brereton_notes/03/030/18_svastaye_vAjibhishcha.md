It is difficult to know how to construe the first pāda of this vs. I take it as a nominal main clause expressing the purpose of the subordinate clause in b. Ge (/WG) as a parallel subordinate clause with pāda b, for which a verb (ausziehst ‘set out for’) must be supplied -- all dependent on pāda c. Re as part of a single subord. cl.

introduced by yád in b, also all dependent on c. Each of these solutions has drawbacks. Mine requires nothing to be supplied (Re’s supplies less than Ge’s), and it also avoids two problems produced by Re’s interpr: a worrisomely late position of yád and an untethered ca in the middle of pāda a. But mine comes with a certain awkwardness of expression and an ill-assorted conjoined pair (“for well-being and with horses”).

However the various interpr. of ab differ, they all agree in taking āsátsi as the verb in the subor. cl. introduced by yád, thus showing the older non-imperatival (that is, subjunctive) value of the so-called “-si imperative.”
