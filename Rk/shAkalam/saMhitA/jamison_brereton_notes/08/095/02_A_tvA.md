HvN restore the sandhi in a (asyā́ndhasa) as asya ándhasa, but asyá should surely be accented, with the Pp., because it modifies ándhasaḥ rather than being used pronominally.

I follow Ge in supplying vikṣú with the fem. víśvāsu in c, on the basis of 3d.

But other nouns are possible: just in nearby hymns víśvāsu is found with samátsu (‘battles’, VIII.90.2), gīṛṣú (‘hymns’, VIII.92.7), and kṛṣṭíṣu (‘communities’, VIII.92.18), and a semantic case could be made for each of these, even the first.
