The standard tr. (save for Hoffmann, Injunk. 100, sim. to my interpr.) take … sphigyā̀kṣā́m ávasthāḥ as “you covered/ clothed the earth with your hip,” but the medial root pres. to √vas means ‘wear’ and takes an acc. of the garment rather than an acc. of the entity being clothed (the construction found with vāsáya-). See the similar ex. at VIII.4.8 and the comm. there, as well as the similar sentiment found in I.173.6, where Indra wears Heaven and Earth as various accessories. The point of course is to emphasize Indra’s vast size by making Earth (and Heaven) seem puny in comparison. A similar point was made in vs. 7d, as well as in the immediately preceding pāda 11c.
