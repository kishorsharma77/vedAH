Since kṣáya- otherwise means only ‘dwelling place’, the text as we have it means “Viṣṇu, the lofty dwelling place,” as in the publ. tr., not “der hohe Wohner” (my italics), as Ge would have it. Already BR (see Gr s.v. kṣáya-) suggested that we read instead a bahuvrīhi *bṛhát-kṣayaḥ ‘having a lofty dwelling place’. This of course makes better immediate sense, but I think we can keep the text as we have it and also avoid making kṣáya- into a nonce agent noun (per Ge). Given the flexibility of RVic diction, it is not difficult to identify a god with his most characteristic product —in this case, Viṣṇu’s three footsteps, particularly his highest one, which becomes an important locus in heaven (see, e.g., I.22.19-21) — and he elsewhere is said to create dwelling places: VII.100.4 ví cakrame pṛthivī́m eṣá etā́ṃ, kṣétrāya víṣṇur mā́nuṣe … / urukṣitím … cakāra “Quick Viṣṇu strode across this earth for a dwelling place for Manu … / He has made wide dwelling.” In the RVic conceptual realm it is just one step from creating a dwelling place to being a dwelling place. The identification of Soma with a dwelling place in vs. 13 below supports the literal reading here.
