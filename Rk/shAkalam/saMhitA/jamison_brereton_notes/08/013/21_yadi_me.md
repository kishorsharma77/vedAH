title = "21"

I struggle to make the final verse of the tṛca fit with the speculative scenario sketched for the first two verses (19-20). (As far as I can tell, neither Ge nor Old makes the attempt, an omission with which I am in sympathy.) One thing to account for is the switch from 3rd ps. in 19-20 (though note te in 19a) to a 1st

-2nd
partnership in 21. I suggest that the stotā́in 19 (and 20, by my reading) is now the 1st ps. speaker of 21. He offers Indra companionship or partnership (sakhyám) modeled on that shared by Indra and the Maruts, of which he had a vision in vs. 20. The sign of Indra’s chosing his companionship will be his (=Indra’s) acceptance of the speaker’s offered soma.

On ā́váraḥ see comm. on I.143.6. It may be better to tr. it as ‘grant’, rather than ‘choose’. If so, I would change the sentence immediately above to “The sign of Indra’s granting his companionship …”
