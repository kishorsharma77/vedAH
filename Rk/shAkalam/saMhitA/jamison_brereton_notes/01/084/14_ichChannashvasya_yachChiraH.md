The syntax of this verse is somewhat unclear. I take ab as a rel. clause with the pres. part. ichán functioning as the main verb and an unusual, indeed disturbing, position of the rel. pron. yád (we might expect *ichán yád áśvasya …), which is then picked up by tád in the main clause of c. Most other tr. take ichán as part of the main clause and the yád as the marker of an embedded rel. cl.: roughly “seeking the head of the horse, which was set away in the mountains, he found it…” But not only would I prefer not to allow embedded relatives in the RV, but the position of yád makes this interpretation difficult, too (expect *ichánn áśvasya śíraḥ yád …?).
