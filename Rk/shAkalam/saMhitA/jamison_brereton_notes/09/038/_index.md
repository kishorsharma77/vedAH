Like IX.37 with sá opening every vs., every vs. in this hymn begins with a form of the eṣá- pronoun. The pattern here is both more complex and more emphatic: there is case variation (vss. 2 and 3 have acc. sg. etám, the rest nom. sg. eṣá), and in all vss. but vs. 2 the initial pronoun is followed by the appropriate form of syá-/tyá-: eṣá (u) syá, etáṃ tyám, a phrase that means ‘this very (one)’.
