Reverence I proclaim to lofty heaven, to the two world-halves, to Mitra  and to Varuṇa who gives rewards—to the very compassionate one  
who gives rewards.  
Approach Indra and Agni, heaven-dominating Aryaman and Bhaga with  praise.  
Living for a long time may we be accompanied by progeny—may we be  accompanied by the aid of Soma.
