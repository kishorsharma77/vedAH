Ge and Re take uccárātaḥ as the verb of all of ab, whose action unfolds “under heaven” (unterhalb des Himmels), but the contrast between aváḥ ‘down’ and úd ‘up’ invites an interpr. of cyclical complementary action -- the rising and setting of the two heavenly bodies. I therefore supply a verb of motion with pāda a.

I read pāda c with both ab and d.
