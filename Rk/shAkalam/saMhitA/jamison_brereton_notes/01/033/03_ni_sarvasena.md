Although the gen. in the rel. cl. yásya váṣṭi appears to be parallel to aryáḥ, as I’ve tr. it, it may be better as a datival gen. “for whomever he wishes,” that is, Indra redistributes cows belonging to enemies to his friends.

I’ve tr. the part. coṣkūyámāṇaḥ as an impv. to avoid the awkwardness of “continuing to poke…” In my opinion asmád ádhi continues the “distance” theme, and is equivalent to the common āré asmát.
