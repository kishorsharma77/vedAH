Ge suggests, probably correctly, that b concerns Agni.

Though most tr., explicitly or implicitly, take Night as subj. of c as well as d, it makes more sense to me for Dawn and Night to be contrastive subjects of the final two pƒÅdas, with Dawn going forth as Night cedes her place. The balanced contrast is brought out strongly in the next two vss.
