The two halves of this verse are conceptually more complex than those preceding. Most tr. take a and b as implicitly contrastive: Agni’s blaze is undomesticated but he is nonetheless intimately familiar -- e.g., Ge “Dessen Flamme schwer heimisch wird, (und doch ist er) eingeboren wie die Einsicht.” This is certainly possible. However, although I recognize the contrast between duróka- and nítya-, I think the poet is equating the two elements in a clever play: Agni’s flame can’t be controlled and “domesticated” anymore than a man in the grip of his own will.

As for the second half, I find it hard to believe that the poet is implying that one’s wife is at the disposition of everybody, with the distasteful sexual connotations this implies -- as in Re’s “(se mettent) à disposition pour chacun comme l’épouse sur la couche.” Rather I think this is the Papageno situation: all it takes for anyone to be happy is his own wife in his lap.
