I think the idea behind the simile is that elephants establish a large territory in which they wander, and that Indra has established a similarly large territory by giving to sacrificers scattered all over the map. Ge’s “mit seinem Bruntsaft” (‘rutting liquid’) stems from an idea of Pischel’s (see Old, Kl. Sch 306) connecting this passage with the later (Epic+ dāna- meaning elephant’s rutting liquid [see EWA s.v. dāná-]). This seems unlikely and it is hard to see how simile and frame would work together.

I have toyed with another possibility that remains tantalizingly hard to realize: dānā́may indeed be a pun, but a different one: an instrumental both to dānā́, as it’s taken here, and also to dāmán- ‘rope’ (whose inst. is indeed regularly dānā́). In this second reading ná would be ‘not’, not ‘like’, and vāraṇáḥ would be some derivative of √vṛ ‘hold back, restrain’ in addition to ‘wild’. The meaning of the second reading would be “a beast not (to be) restrained by a rope,” in addition to “Like a wild elephant … by his giving.” The second reading would harmonize with 6a, 10b ávṛtaḥ ‘unobstructable’ and be paraphrased by the next pāda in its own verse, 8c nákiṣ ṭvā ní yamat “No one will restrain you.” However, I have been unable to find a way to make vāraṇá- a plausible form of √vṛ in the correct sense and so have not pursued this possibility further.
