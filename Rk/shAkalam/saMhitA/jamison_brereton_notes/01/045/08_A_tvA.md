Note the phonetic figure in c: br̥hád bhā́bíbhrato havír, playing with b, bh, and h; ṛ and r.

Most tr. take bṛhád bhā́ḥ ‘lofty light’ as coreferential with tvā (=Agni), not as object of bíbhrataḥ, parallel with havíḥ. This in some ways makes better sense, though the word order weakly favors my tr. Old (SBE) also takes the phrase as the obj. of bíbhrataḥ and adduces a telling parallel, IV.5.1 kathā́dāśemāgnáye bṛhád bhā́ḥ, where the phrase is emphatically not coreferential with Agni.
