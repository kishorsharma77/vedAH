As noted in the comment on the last verse, the ritual model here is shaken up a bit: Indra and Vāyu are urged to come with práyobhiḥ, a word generally used of ‘pleasurable offerings’ that are presented to the gods and to which they come (cf. VIII.60.4 abhí práyāṃsi ... gahi). Our translation “with delight,” agreeing with most other translators, avoids, and conceals, the problem. The gods should not be bringing práyāṃsi. The little disturbance of the ritual model is confined to these two verses in this hymn.

The pāda-final position of hí here is unusual, and I have no explanation for it, esp. as it does not take second position in its clause as is usual.

I.2.7-9: As mentioned in the intro., this tṛca contains the trio dhī́‘insight’ (vs. 7), krátu- ‘intention’ (vs. 8), and dákṣa- ‘skill’ (vs. 9), the three elements necessary to conceive and carry out an action. Their interconnection is emphasized by the fact that all three are in the accusative and each is stationed initial in the last pāda of its verse.

The juxtaposition across vss. 8-9 of krátum (beginning 8c) and kavī́ (beginning 9a) may also be meant to evoke the well-established compound kavíkratu- ‘having the will/resolve of a poet’, ‘having a poet’s purpose’, an occurrence of which is found in the preceding hymn by the same poet (I.1.5).
