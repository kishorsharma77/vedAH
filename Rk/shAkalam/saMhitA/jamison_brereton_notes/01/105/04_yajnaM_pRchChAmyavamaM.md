Most tr. take avamám as modifying yajñám, but I take it as referring to the addressee, namely Agni (more clearly identified by his messenger role in b, dūtáḥ), in the usual double acc. construction with √pṛch. For Agni as avamá- see IV.1.5 sá tváṃ no agne 'vamó bhavotī́. The poet asks Agni about the fate of the sacrifice/hymn (the “truth,” ṛtám) when it has been offered: where does it go and does anyone get and keep it (in heaven). He wants Agni to answer, because Agni, as the messenger, has access to both worlds.
