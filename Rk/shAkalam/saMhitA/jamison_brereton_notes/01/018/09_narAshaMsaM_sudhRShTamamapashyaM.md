Note the high proportion of sibilants in this verse.

The meaning of makhá- and its relatives (here represented by the second cmpd. member -makhas-) is much discussed. I consider it to have both martial and bountiful senses. I take the original sense to be martial and, despite some difficulties, believe the often suggested connection with Grk. μάχομαι. The ‘bounteous’ sense comes, in my opinion, from secondary association with maghá-, etc. In this compound sádmamakhas- most tr. take the second member in a ‘give, be bounteous’ sense (e.g., Ge “der einen Wohnsitz beschert,” Re “qui confère-généreusement un siège,” WG “den … mit einem Himmelssitz freigebigen”). However, the martial sense fits the context well. The image is of the smoke of the ritual fire rising to, and thus visually ‘besieging’, heaven itself (so Gr). See Old’s disc.; Scar (277) questioningly suggests both.
