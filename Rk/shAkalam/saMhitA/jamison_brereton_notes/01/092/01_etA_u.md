In pāda a my tr. differs slightly from the standard ones. I suggest that the dawns have transformed themselves into a beacon, while in the standard interpr. they have created/manufactured a beacon for themselves.

In b following Proferes 2003 (JAOS 123, pp. 330-31), I suggest, on the basis of the fuller expression in the parallel verse 5c, that their “beam” is being anointed like the sacrificial post (sváru-) at a ritual.

In c the poet exploits the syntactic ambiguity of the middle participle niṣkṛṇvāná-. In the frame he takes it as a reflexive, “presenting themselves,” but in the simile it is transitive “presenting arms.” The middle voice is still justified, however, because the weapons belong to the subjects of the participle.
