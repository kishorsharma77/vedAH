Thematically and lexically connected with the preceding verse (8) despite straddling the pragātha boundary. In 8c we identify ourselves as vípravacas- ‘having inspired speech’, and in 9ab it is said that either a vípra or a non-vípra might offer his vácas- to Indra, with good results either way. Although this seems like a non-RVic sentiment (esp. after 8c), since ordinarily only good poets (like us) are meant to achieve success, perhaps the “inspired poet” is being implicitly contrasted with a non-inspired but still skillful poet. In the other occurrence of aviprá- in the RV (VI.45.2), Indra “places vitality even in the uninspired,” so perhaps, alternatively, here even the uninspired poet achieves success simply by dedicating his product to Indra and acquiring luster by this contact.

The accusative of the offering with √vidh is a bit unusual, but not unprecedented (see, e.g., I.189.1), and Ge’s rather deviant tr. “die Rede recht gemacht hat” and his alternative suggestion that vácaḥ represents vácasā at the end of the pāda are both unnecessary.

On the apparent bad cadence produced by ávidhat, see remarks ad II.1.7, where Arnold’s suggestion to read a long augment is adopted.

The apparent subj. mamandat certainly can work as a subjunctive in context and is so rendered in the publ. tr. However, note that it immediately precedes t u vāyā́, beg. with t-, and we might be dealing with an unetymological doubling from an underlying *mamanda tu vāyā́. The final syllable of the verb would then be light, but this doesn’t cause major metrical problems. Nonetheless, I’m inclined to stick with the subjunctive. On the other hand, on the basis of VII.18.21 and VII.33.1, I now think it is possible that prá mamanda(t) should be interpr. as transitive, with ‘you’ [=Indra] supplied as object, perhaps as haplology from *tvā tvāyā́as I suggest ad VII.18.21. For the motivations for this reinterpr., see disc. there. The altered tr.

would be “… will exhilarate / has exhilarated (you) in devotion to you.” On the other hand, the intrans. interpr. in the publ. tr. makes slightly more sense in this context -- and forms of √ma(n)d can be either trans. or intrans., so the current tr. could be maintained.

The voc. ahaṃsana is surely rightly explained (Old ad V.75.2, AiG II.1.327, III.437) as a univerbation of a VP aháṃ sanā “I shall win” (see V.75.2 for another instantiation of this phrase). (AiG II.1.327 suggests aháṃ saneyam, but the thematic subjunctive matches the compound better.)
