The comparison of the estivating frog to a “dried-out leather bag” (dṛ́tiṃ ná śúṣkam) may reflect a natural phenomenon: a 1932 “Notes on Indian Batrachians” by one C. McCann in the Bombay Journal of Natural History recounts an experiment undertaken by him that involved depriving frogs of water until they became shrunken and dried out like pieces of wood and then rehydrating them, at which point they began behaving normally.

It is difficult to interpr. sarasī́as anything but a loc., but its morphology is a bit problematic. To the well-attested -s-stem sáras- ‘pond’, the loc. sg. is the expected sárasi (IX.97.52), but our form not only shows an unusual ending with a long ī, but it also bears the accent. No other forms to a putative stem sarasī́- (so Gr, 135 etc.) are found. Wackernagel-Debrunner (AiG II.1.306; II.2.384) also posit a sarasī́- stem, a vṛkī-type fem. with collective meaning, with loc. sg. in -ī́(AiG III.170; see also Lanman, Noun Inflection, 389), by way of a contraction of *sarasí y

-i. Though
vṛkī́-loc. sgs. are rare, see nadī́(I.135.9) and gaurī́(IX.12.3) to better established vṛkī́-stems. On balance, it seems best to posit a stem sarasī́- with Gr, Lanman, Old, Wackernagel-Debrunner, etc., but I do so reluctantly because of its extreme isolation and the widespread attestation of the -as-stem sáras-.
