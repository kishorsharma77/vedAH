Weapons  
Pāyu Bhāradvāja  
19 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 6, 10; anuṣṭubh 12–13, 15–16, 19  
This supplemental hymn attached to the end of the maṇḍala is one of the most  memorable and delightful in the R̥gveda. It praises the weapons of battle and their  parts, and it is structured as a list of riddles. Each weapon receives one verse; some times the weapon is named at the beginning of the verse (as in vs. 2), but more often  it is found only toward the end, preceded by a riddling definition. Particularly strik ing are the verses in which the subject is described as a seductive woman or tender  mother (vss. 3–4), a characterization that contrasts sharply with the violence of  battle. (Weapons so described are feminine in grammatical gender.) In the following  translation the weapon that is the answer to the riddle is italicized.  
The hymn is more or less metrically unified for the first ten verses, and verse 10  reads like a hymn-final verse, breaking the riddle pattern to beg a collection of gods  and ancestors for protection. The rest of the hymn alternates trimeter and dimeter  meter, and although the riddling verses continue (vss. 11, 13–15), there is also direct  address to the weapons themselves and prayers to various gods for protection. The  more various character of this second part of the hymn has led some scholars to  consider it an even later addition, although this does not seem a necessary conclu  
sion. The final verse (19) calls down destruction on every type of enemy and affirms  the primacy of the protective sacred formulation—as “inner armor,” thus paired  with the outer armor (the same word várman) found in the first verse of the hymn.  Thus, whether secondarily or not, the hymn has a faint ring structure.
