As noted in the publ. intro., I take the vājín- here to be the patron, for whom the Maruts create a worthy poet.

I take gántā as a periphrastic future. VII.32.10 gámat sá gómati vrajé is entirely parallel, save for having a subjunctive (gámat) in place of the agent noun here, which suggests a future sense for the latter.
