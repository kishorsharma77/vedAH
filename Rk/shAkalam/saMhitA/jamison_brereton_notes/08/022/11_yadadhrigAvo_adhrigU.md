Although ádhrigu- is simply a -u-stem, the negated form of Aves. drigu- ‘poor’ (see comm. ad I.61.1), in the nom. pl. it is treated as if it were a cmpd. with ‘cow’, with ádhrigāvaḥ (also I.64.3) instead of expected *ádhrigavaḥ (see AiG III.158). But things may be more complicated, for, as Gr notes, in I.61.1 the dat. ádhrigave would be better metrically as *ádhrigāve. In this case it does not match the ‘cow’ word, whose dative is gáve. However, Wackernagel (AiG III.149) considers an emendation to -gāve unnecessary and refers to Old (Prol. 90 and Noten ad loc.) for the meter. It’s also possible that I.61.1 just borrowed the length from I.64.3, both Nodhas products, because the stem was not entirely understood.
