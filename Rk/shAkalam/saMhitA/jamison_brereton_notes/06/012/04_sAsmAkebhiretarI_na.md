The first hemistich is partly assembled from material also found elsewhere: the quite straightforward 2nd pāda is identical to VII.12.2b. The post-caesura portion of the first pāda, etárī ná śūṣaíḥ, is also found at V.41.10, where the pre-caesura portion, gṛṇīté agníḥ “Agni is sung”, is functionally identical to our 2nd pāda (esp.

agní ṣṭave “Agni is praised”). On etárī as a loc., see comm. ad V.41.10; note that this word is a partial anagram of 3a vanerāṭ.

In c note the insistent phonetic figure: dr(ú)vanno vanván krát(u)vā ná árvā.

The interpr. of pāda d is difficult because of the highly unusual form jārayā́yi, which has been much discussed (see esp. Old ZDMG 55.302-3). Since the hemistich otherwise lacks a verb form, it is tempting to see a verb here. But the accent makes trouble because this is a main clause with no syntactic break evident before the word.

Nonetheless, it is generally taken as a nonce aor. passive and quite possibly a punning one: as a denom. to jārá- ‘wooer, lover’ (hence ‘become a wooer’) and as a pass. built to the caus. jāráyati (/ jaráyati) ‘awaken’. The pun is most clearly expressed in Ge’s tr. “wie der Vater des Uṣas zum Buhlen ward, so wurde er durch die Opfer erweckt”; he takes it as referring to the myth of incest of Heaven, also signalled by the phrase usráḥ pitéva “like the father of Dawn.” Although I am always game (perhaps too game) to see puns everywhere in the RV, I am dubious about the one suggested here. For one thing the somewhat anomalous stem uṣár-/usr- is never used for personified Dawn, but only for the temporal dawn. (For supposed voc. uṣar in I.49.4 see comm. ad loc. and Lundquist 2014.) It seems unlikely that the stem typed for the goddess, uṣás-, would not be used in this myth where her identity is so very crucial. Moreover, I rather doubt that usráḥ here is a gen. sg. with pitéva. Not only is the simile particle wrongly placed (though this is not rare), but usrás is almost always an acc. pl., which can express extent of time (e.g., VII.15.8). The solution I favor for jārayā́yi is one also mentioned by Old, stemming from Ludwig, and endorsed by Debrunner in the Nachtr. to AiG I [p. 163] -- that it belong to a gerundive stem jārayā́y(i)ya- ‘to be awakened’ and the expected nom. sg. * jārayā́y(i)yaḥ lost its final syllable by haplology before yajñaíḥ, not surprisingly in this y(a)-rich environment. This gerundive is predicated and serve in lieu of a finite verb. For a similarly formed predicated gerundive, see nearby trayayā́y(i)yaḥ at VI.2.7.
