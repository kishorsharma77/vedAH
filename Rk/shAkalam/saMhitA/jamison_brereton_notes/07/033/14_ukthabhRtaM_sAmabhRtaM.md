As Ge (n. 14) points out, this vs. seems to pick up 10d, describing the second “birth” of Vasiṣṭha, when Agastya presents him to the clan, and it seems to consist of Agastya’s direct speech. As Old points out, the first hemistich seems to identify the three priests of śrauta ritual, though not by title: the Hotar, supporter of the ukthá-; the Udgātar, supporter of the sā́man-; and the Adhvaryu, supporter of the pressing stone, i.e., the one who performs the physical actions. Assuming this is the case makes it reasonably likely that the weaving of “the covering stretched by Yama” (9c, 12c) does indeed refer to the production of the sacrifice. Vasiṣṭha is thus presented as responsible for the whole of the sacrifice, not just a portion of it.
