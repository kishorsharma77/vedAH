The publ. tr. starts the vs. in the 2nd ps. (“you two who”) and ends in the 3rd ps. (“these two”). This does not represent the text entirely fairly, because the grammatical person is entirely unclear until the last pāda, which contains an acc. dual dvandva and a 3rd ps. dual acc. prn. (tā́) and a 1st ps. pl. verb. Until pāda d Indra and Agni are represented only by the insistent rel. du. yā́(a, b, c). The vs. could therefore be couched entirely in the 3rd ps. (“the two who …”), as the standard tr. do. I stand by my modulatory tr. because, based on vs. 1 with its voc. dual dvandva and 2nd du. verb ávathaḥ, we start vs. 2 assuming the 2nd ps. context carries over, and nothing disturbs that assumption until the very end of the vs. ### 02-04
Vs. 3 is the middle vs. of the hymn, since vs. 6 is in a different meter and is an extra-hymnic summary vs. It has the marks of an omphalos, esp. semantic and syntactic obscurity. The real difficulties lie in the central 3cd along with 4a, which is verbally related to 3cd by the problematic eṣ-forms (see below). The omphalos is framed, in classic omphalos fashion, by indrāgnī́(tā́) havāmahe in 2d and 4b.
