The image in pāda c needs a little unpacking. The “eye in heaven” is of course the sun; the incongruity is that it is depicted as “stretched out,” which might suggest an elongated ovoid sun, not a happy picture. The concentrated expression of pāda c rests on the common formula of the sun stretching (through space) with its rays (raśmí-), as in VII.47.4 yā́ḥ sū́ryo raśmíbhir ātatā́na “towards which [=waters] the sun has stretched with its rays.” Note that sūráyaḥ ‘patrons’ ending b phonologically evokes the absent sū́r i ya- in c.
