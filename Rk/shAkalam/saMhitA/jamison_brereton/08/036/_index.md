Indra
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
7 verses: śakvarī, except mahāpaṅkti 7
Despite the length and elaboration of the meter—a śakvarī verse consists of fifty six syllables arranged in at least six pādas (for Oldenberg seven)—most of each of  the first six verses in this hymn consists of refrain; only the first pāda, of twelve1104 VIII.36
syllables, varies in each verse. This structure is almost identical to that of the pre ceding hymn (VIII.35).
This hymn and the following one, VIII.37, although in different (but  related) meters, are twinned conceptions. Both are seven verses long; both  devote most of the first six verses to refrain, reserving only the first pāda  of each verse for new material. The final verses of both hymns are almost  identical save for a few lexical variants, the most important of which is the  correspondence between bráhmāṇi “priestly formulations” in VIII.36.7 and  kṣatrā́ṇi “lordly powers” in VIII.37.7. This correspondence suggests that the  hymns were designed as appropriate to brahmins and kṣatriyas respectively,  and though the formalized doctrine of the three twice-born varṇas seems  to be taking shape only in the late R̥gveda (see especially the Puruṣasūkta,  X.90.11–12), it is surely no accident, as Oldenberg points out (Noten ad loc.),  that this same group of Śyāvāśva hymns contains a tripartite blessing clearly  referring to the three upper varṇas (VIII.35.16–18). Nonetheless in this hymn  there seems little that is specifically applicable to the brahmin and only to him,  and indeed the strong emphasis on victory in the refrain would seem more a  warrior than a priestly preoccupation.
Since Śyāvāśva is best known for his Marut cycle in the Vth Maṇḍala (V.52–61),  it is entirely appropriate that Indra is “accompanied by the Maruts” in this refrain.  Śyāvāśva’s ancestors the Atris (note his patronymic Ātreya) are also glorified in this  hymn (vss. 6–7); the Atris are, of course, more at home in their own family maṇḍala,  V, than in VIII.
