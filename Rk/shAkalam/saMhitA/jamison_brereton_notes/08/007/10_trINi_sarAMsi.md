The stem pṛ́śni- in the plural otherwise refers to “dappled cows” and is marked (by pronouns and modifying adjectives) as feminine; see the immediate preceding hymn VIII.6.19, as well as VIII.69.3, I.84.11. Here, however, there are no diagnostically feminine forms syntactically associated with pṛ́śnayaḥ. This allows it to refer both to (fem.) dappled cows and to the (masc.) Maruts, whose mother is Pṛśni. Although the Maruts are regularly called “Rudras” after their father Rudra (e.g., 12b), this is the only place in the RV where they are called “Pṛśnis” after their mother. This verse reprises 3bc … pṛ́śnimātaraḥ / dhukṣánta pipyúśīm íṣam “They whose mother is Prś̥ ni have milked out swelling refreshment,” with the bahuvrīhi pṛ́śnimātaraḥ matched with pṛ́śnayaḥ here and dhukṣánta matching duduhré. The pṛ́śnimātaraḥ in 3b all but ensures that we will take pṛ́śnayaḥ here as a referent to the Maruts.

The referent of the three lakes they milk out as honey is the rain they produce.
