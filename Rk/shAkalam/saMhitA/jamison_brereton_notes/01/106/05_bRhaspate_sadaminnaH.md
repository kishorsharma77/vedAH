Ge (/WG) take the 1st member of mánurhita- as functionally a dative (“für Manu bestimmt.” Although this fits smoothly into the passage, I think it likely that the standard agentive reading of 1st members of ppl. compounds should stand here.

Ge cites I.114.2 as parallel -- yác cháṃ ca yóś ca mánur āyejé -- but that passage states that it was Manu who won the luck and lifetime by sacrifice. In other words he was the agent, as he would be here in this compound.
