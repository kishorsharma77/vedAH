The first hemistich is notable for its sequence of four root noun cmpds in -jít- ‘winning, winner’. For their possible structural role in the hymn, see comm. ad vs. 4.

IX.59.2; As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. contains three occurrences of the impv.

pávasva, each pāda init. Each of these is construed with a dat. pl. (or abl., acdg. to Sāy.; but see the parallel Ge cites [n. 2] that speaks for the dat.). This tight repetitive syntactic structure suggests that the three datives should form a semantic set. The first two are waters (adbhyáḥ) and plants (óṣadhībhyáḥ). As for the third, dhiṣánābhyaḥ, Ge interpr. it as “ die (priestlichen) Werke” (and see his extensive n. on the word, n.2c), Re as “les inspirations (des humains).” However, flg. Pinault (Vedic Workshop, 2007), I take the orig. sense of dhiṣáṇā- to be ‘holy place’, and in this context I think it likely that it refers to the hearths holding the ritual fires. If so, the trio of datives would refer to three vital physical elements of the soma sacrifice: “the waters” for swelling the soma stalk and for mixing the pressed soma, “the plants” representing the soma plant itself, and “the Holy Places / hearths” representing the fire into which the soma is offered. The more attenuated interpr. of Ge and Re are not impossible, but are not as tightly bound to the substances in ab as the fires/hearths would be.

Re notes the phonetic play (pávasv)ādbhyó ádābhyaḥ in a.
