I do not understand why the song would be flowing ‘in three parts’ (/’threefold’; tredhá), nor is the meaning and referent of loc. bāḷhé clear. But comparison with tribarhíṣi sádasi “on the seat with three (layers) of barhis” in the next vs., 8b, may help. Assuming bāḷhá- belongs to √baṃh ‘be/make thick, firm’, we can assign bāḷhá- the sense ‘thickened, plumped up’ and suggest that bāḷhé refers to the barhis, which has been plumped up invitingly, like a sofa cushion, for the gods to sit on, with its three layers ensuring a soft seat. As for tredhā́I now think it qualifies not the song, as in the publ. tr., but the seat, and would now tr. “… flowing to the (ritual grass) plumped up threefold/in three parts.” As in 5d the two parts of this phrase bāḷhé tredhā́are separated by the intrusive voc. aśvinā.
