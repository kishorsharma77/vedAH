The ritual referent of the “six yoked” entities (ṣáḍ yuktā́n) is unclear, no matter whether Soma or Agni is taken as the main referent: those in the Soma camp consider the yoked ones to be the dakṣiṇās due the poet; I consider them the flames of the recovered Agni, roused by the drops of ghee. In terms of the simile in c, the six yoked ones are clearly the teams for plowing. See esp. AV VI.91.1, cited by Schaefer (1994: 197). On anu √sidh as ‘entlangtreiben’, see Schaefer 1994: 196-97.

In my translation I have reversed the renderings of the finite intensive (unaccented carkṛśat in c) and the intensive participle (accented anuséṣidhat) to make the relationship between simile and frame clearer.
