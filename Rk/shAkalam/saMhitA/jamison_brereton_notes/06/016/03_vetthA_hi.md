Klein (DGRV II.122) tr. b patháś ca devā́ ñjasā as “and the paths going straight unto the heavenly ones,” apparently reading devā́ ñjasā as a cmpd., contrary to the Pp.

and all standard tr. (incl. mine), which separate deva as a voc. Although I think the voc. interpretation is correct, cf. X.73.7 pathó devatrā́ñjaseva yā́nān “… the paths as if going straight to the gods,” with the adv. devatrā́immed. preceding and construed with áñjasā. On the basis of X.73.7 and similar phraseology, Insler (KZ 82 [1968] “Vedic áñjasā, ṛñjasāná-, and the Type sahasāná-,” p. 6) takes devā́ ñjasā as a shortening of devatrā́ ñjasā or “a type of haplological abbreviation of devayā́ nān áñjasā” or possibly even directly as an “adverbial-type compound” devāñjásā, and Klein must be flg. the Insler interpr. one way or the other. Although X.73.7 is suggestive, I do not think it is sufficient to allow the rather extreme type of haplology posited by Insler.
