The ‘back’ (sā́nā́) is the back of the filter; the fuller expression is sā́no ávye “on the sheep’s back,” as in nearby IX.97.3 mr̥jyate sā́no ávye.

Ge renders vāvaśānám as “dem Verlangenden” (to √vaś ‘desire’), in contrast to Re and the publ. tr., which take it to √vāś ‘bellow’. In actual fact it is probably a pun. On the one hand, in this vs. Soma is strongly typed as bovine (a: mahiṣám ‘buffalo’, b: ukṣánam ‘ox’), which favors ‘bellow’. On the other, the end of the previous vs. contains a reciprocal expression from √vaś: 3d uśatī́r uśántam “(they) desiring, (him) desiring.” So both roots are in play here and equally applicable to Soma. For a similar situation see nearby IX.93.4 and comm. thereon.

For Trita as the archetypal soma-preparer, see comm. ad IX.37.4. Here Soma is identified with Varuṇa because of Varuṇa’s (developing) association with water and the sea. See Lü (52, 268), Ober (II.100 and n. 406).
