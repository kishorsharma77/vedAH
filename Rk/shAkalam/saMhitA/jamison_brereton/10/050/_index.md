Indra Vaikuṇthạ  
Indra Vaikuṇṭha  
7 verses: jagatī 1–2, abhisāriṇī 3–4, triṣṭubh 5, jagatī 6–7  
A much more conventional Indra hymn than the preceding two of this series (X.48– 49). Here Indra is praised in the context and at the occasion of a soma sacrifice, and  the usual reciprocal obligations of sacrificer and god are set forth.
