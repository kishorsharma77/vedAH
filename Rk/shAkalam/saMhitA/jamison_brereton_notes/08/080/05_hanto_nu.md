The emphatic interjection hánta is presumably originally the 2nd pl.

imperative to √han ‘smite’ (flg. Thieme, Fremdl. 2-3, though EWA s.v. expresses doubts) with full-grade root - hence my tr. ‘blast it!’ It occurs only 3x in the RV, the other two in X, in direct speech contexts and in hymns identified by Arnold (Ved.

Metre) as popular. Here it continues the slangy tone set by baḍā́(1) and the questions in 3.

Ge supplies a verb in c: “(uns bring) … Ruhm,” while I take the acc. neuter phrase there as a loose goal: “put … first for … fame.” Note that the vājayú qualifying śrávaḥ reappears in the next verse as a masc. modifying rátham.
