The publ. tr. takes pāda a as a nominal sentence with a predicated present participle (píprataḥ), a fairly rare but not unprecedented construction. This has two advantages: 1) it provides the verse with a main clause, 2) it avoids an anomalous position for yád. However, since yád is also badly positioned in 3a and 8b, the second observation may not be an argument. See remarks on 8 below.
