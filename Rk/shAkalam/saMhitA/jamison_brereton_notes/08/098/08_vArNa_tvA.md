The simile vā́r ná … yavyā́bhiḥ is syntactically ambiguous, in that vā́r can be the comparandum of either subject or object, though it probably makes better sense as an object, as Ge takes it: (a body of) water growing with floods of (tributary?) water. However, a nominative interpretation is by no means excluded, as waters not infrequently swell things and make them grow; cf., e.g., I.65.4 várdhantīm ā́paḥ … súśiśvim “The waters strengthen the lovely child.” For an overelaborate interpretation see Oberlies (Relig. I.521).
