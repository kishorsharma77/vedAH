The splv. śámbhaviṣṭha- recalls śáṃtama- in 1a. Both stems are reasonably well attested, though śáṃtama- has the edge. They do not seem to be consistently distinguished in usage, but śáṃtama- seems more common qualifying inanimates while śámbhaviṣṭha- and its base śambhú-/-ū́- are more common with animates. Such is the case in this hymn, where śáṃtamā in 1a modifies ‘hymn’ (gī́ḥ) and śámbhaviṣṭhaḥ in 7c modifies Bṛhaspati. Nonetheless, the tr. of the two forms should be harmonized.
