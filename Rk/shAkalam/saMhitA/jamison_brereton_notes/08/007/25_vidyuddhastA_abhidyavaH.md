I have punctuated pāda b as a parenthetical expression, a nominal locational clause, but in context it is the equivalent of a decompounded bahuvrīhi modifying the Maruts and parallel to vidyúddhastā(ḥ) ‘having lightning in their hands’ in pāda a (so approx. Re). A bahuvrīhi would have been difficult to construct with these elements. Including the modifier ‘golden’ would have produced a threemember compound, which would be unusual for the RV, and determining what form ‘head’ (śíras- / śīṛṣ-ṇ-) would have taken as the final member of a masc. pl.

bahuvrīhi may have defeated the poet. This analytic expression is given somewhat fuller form in V.54.11.
