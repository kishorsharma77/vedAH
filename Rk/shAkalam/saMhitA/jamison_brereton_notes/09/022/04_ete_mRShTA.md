With Ge/Re I take ná as neg. with pf. śaśramuḥ. In contrast, Kü (524, 551) takes it as the simile particle: “... sind wie [Rennpferde], die gelaufen sind, ermüdet ...” He cites (551 n. 1141) Delbrück (Altind. Syn. 376) for this interpr., but Delbrück in fact takes the ná as neg.: “… sind nicht müde geworden, obgleich sie gelaufen sind.” I assume that Kü so interpr. because of the position of ná after the participle, but in a Gāyatrī pāda the position before the verb is also the position after the NP -- there’s not a lot of space. I think it unlikely that the poets would ever say that the ever-running soma could get tired. Moreover, √śram almost always appears with neg.
