Ge (/WG) supply a verb as the 1st member of the disjunctive utá vā constr., contrasting with jighatnúḥ (“Wenn uns ein Unbekannter (nachstellt), oder töten will …”), invoking VI.5.4 with yó naḥ sánutyo abhidā́sat … But more salient in VI.5.4 is the contrastive pair yáḥ … sánutyaḥ … yó ántaraḥ … Therefore, flg. Schmidt (B+I 81; also Klein DGRV II.171), I supply yó ántaraḥ as the 2nd part of the disjunctive phrase. Re actually proposes a clever variation on the “distant … near” contrast, pairing abhikhā́ya, which he renders “(regandant) en face,” with sánutyaḥ. This avoids the need to supply additional material, but employing the rare gerund simply as a polar term with ‘distant’ seems unlikely.

As Gr points out, the idiom ‘hand over, deliver’ is characteristic of pári √dā, not pári √dhā, which generally means ‘clothe, surround’. He suggests that this sense of pári √dhā is attributable to “Verwechslung mit dā.” In a quick scan of the Gr’s conspectus of dhā forms, I found only one example of pári √dhā ‘deliver’, namely our pári dhehi. I wonder if dhehi for *dehi is a nonce hypercorrection, for a form that appeared to have undergone Grassmann’s Law because of the -hi ending.
