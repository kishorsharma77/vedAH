Unlike 8c, where I took sváśva- surátha- as proleptic with the priestly subject “we,” here the man who is sváśva- suhiraṇyá- appears to be already rich, with a chariot full of goods -- and therefore most likely the patron of the sacrifice, who (we hope) will redistribute this wealth to us performers via the sacrifice. This may be the purport of sákhā ‘partner’ here. Ge suggests (n. 10ab) that the figure in question is a ruler returning from battle with booty.
