We might expect *rathī́r iva here, to the vṛkī́-stem rathī́-, but the ending -ī́ must belong instead to the -ín-stem rathín-, which does have an independent existence. See Old ad loc. I take the whip in the simile to be lightning; both a whip and a lightning flash are slender, fast, unpredictable, and have a non-straight trajectory. The flash of lightning would also do the revealing in pāda b. Note also that thunder is covered in pāda c and rain in b and d, so lightning is what’s otherwise absent.

“Rain-bearing cloud” (varṣyàṃ nábhaḥ) in d seems like a quick and a bit halfhearted poetic repair of “rain-bearing messengers” (dūtā́n … varṣyā̀n) in b. The two pādas hold the verb kṛṇute constant.
