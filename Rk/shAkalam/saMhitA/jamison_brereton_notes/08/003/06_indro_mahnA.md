Pāda-final śávaḥ here is often considered to stand for instr. śávasā (see Old for previous lit., Ge’s tr. and n., and most recently Hale [Fs. Melchert], who takes it as an archaic zero-grade s-stem instr., with loss of laryngeal in pause; see comm. ad VIII.39.2). However, as Old points out, an accusative reading is perfectly possible.

The presence of the same pāda-final nom.-acc. form nearby (4c, 8a, 10b) supports an accusative interpretation here.
