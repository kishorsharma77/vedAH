As noted in the intro., this martial verse contrasts with the peaceful preceding one, a contrast emphasized by their parallel structure.

A cute play in nigh√°nighnate, where the preverb ni appears to repeat in the middle of the word, although the second ni consists of the root-final n of the intensive reduplication followed by an i-liaison.
