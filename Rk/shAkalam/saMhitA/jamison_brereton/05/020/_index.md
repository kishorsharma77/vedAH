Agni  
Prayasvanta Ātreya  
4 verses: anuṣṭubh  
As in the previous hymn and the three that follow, the name of the poet has been  extracted from the hymn itself, in this case from práyasvant “bringing pleasing offer ings” in verse 3. The dominant theme is the songs, which are explicitly mentioned in  every verse except verse 2, and even there they are probably the understood object  in ab. Verse 2 is the most interesting in the hymn because it is not clear to whom the  poet refers. It sounds as though the people he criticizes are rival poets, who have  prospered through Agni, but who are in some way not acting or not performing the  ritual properly now.
