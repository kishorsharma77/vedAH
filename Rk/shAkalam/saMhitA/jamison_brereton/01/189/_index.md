Agni  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
Although this hymn begins with a hope for an easy journey to wealth, it is clear  that the poet sees menace everywhere, from which he begs Agni for protection.  The imaginative catalogue of possible hazards and enemies continues through verse  6. Verse 7 breaks this pattern, but implicitly suggests why Agni will remain on the  poet’s side:  the god distinguishes between sacrificers and non-sacrificers, and he  makes himself available to the former.  
The hymn ends with a typical summary verse characterizing the hymn that pre cedes. The poet’s claim that he has spoken “enigmas” seems overblown; in the uni verse of R̥gvedic discourse this hymn is remarkably straightforward, and Agni is  unlikely to find interpreting it particularly challenging. The final verse does, how ever, draw attention to a structural feature of the hymn: the first seven verses all  contain the vocative of the god’s name, in insistent initial position in the first three,  then somewhat postponed in the next four. In the summary verse the direct address  to Agni is absent, and he appears instead in the locative, a grammatical shift that  underlines the change of topic.
