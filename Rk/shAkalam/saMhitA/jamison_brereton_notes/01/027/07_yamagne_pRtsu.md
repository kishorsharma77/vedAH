It is difficult not to interpret the agent noun yantā́in c as a periphrastic future, given the subjunctives in ab, pace Tichy 1995: 226. Although it is sometimes claimed that no examples (or “no certain examples”) of this usage are found in the Saṃhitās (see esp. Macdonell VGS §152), there are too many passages in the RV where a future interpretation of the -tar-stem is more natural and fits the context better than a purely agentive one.
