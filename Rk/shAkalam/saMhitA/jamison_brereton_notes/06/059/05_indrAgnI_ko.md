As noted in the publ. intro., here the poet dissociates the two gods and in the 2nd hemistich focuses only on Agni. I think the dissociation begins in the 1st hemistich, with … asyá vām … ciketati (in my tr.) “…shall perceive this one of you two,” with asyá referring to one of the gods only. Ge and Re by contrast interpr. asyá as referring to an unidentified thing (a wonder or the like) belonging to both.

On cd as referring to Agni and his flames, see the very similar phrase in an Agni hymn X.79.7 víṣūco áśvān yuyuje. Gonda (Ved. Lit. 133) may be right that this refers to Agni using the same vehicle to carry the oblations to heaven and to bring the gods to the sacrifice. Re interpr. the hemistich as referring to both Agni and Indra, at the cost of a lot of machinery liberally sprinkled with parens.

víśūcaḥ would be better rendered as ‘facing in opposite/different directions’.
