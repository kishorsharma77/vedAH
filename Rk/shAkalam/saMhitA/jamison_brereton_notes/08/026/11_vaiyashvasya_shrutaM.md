Pāda c sajóṣasā váruṇo mitró aryamā́“the two of one accord (and) V, M, A” is reminiscent of the number disharmony in vs. 8. It can be seen as a syntactic blend of 8c devā́devébhiḥ … sacánastamā “the two gods joined with the gods” and a putative plural sajóṣasaḥ that includes the Aśvins with the other gods mentioned.
