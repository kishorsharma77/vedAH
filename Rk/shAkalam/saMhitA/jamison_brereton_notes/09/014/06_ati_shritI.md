śrití- is a hapax, on which see Old. It is here an instr. sg. fem., referring to the fine fleece filter, and echoing śritáḥ in 1b.

With Old and Ge I take gavyā́as instr. to gavyā́- ‘longing for cows’, rather than neut.

pl. with Gr and Lub. Re sits on the fence.

Although vidé is ordinarily passive, there are a few precedents for ‘know (as) one’s own’; see VII.40.5, VIII.62.9.
