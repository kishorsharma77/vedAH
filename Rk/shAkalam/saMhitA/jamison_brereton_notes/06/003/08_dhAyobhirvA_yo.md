The vs. is structured as two vā alternatives; the reason for this is unclear. See Klein II.203-4.

The rel. cl. of pāda a has no verb, and the verb of b, davidyot, must belong to a main clause because of its lack of accent. Ge, Re, and Klein (II.203-4) supply “become strengthened’; this certainly makes sense, but there is nothing in context or parallel passages that encourages this invention. Kü (206) goes for a more restrained “versehen ist,” a nominal clause with predicative instrumentals, I suppose. But given the twin rel. cl./main cl. intensives in 7ab (návīnot … nūnot) and the intens. davidyot in 8b, I wonder if the same pattern holds here, and we should supply an intens. form of √dyut in a.

The arká- of pāda a are most likely both chants and rays.

Pāda b is once again metrically irregular: it has a caesura after 3 and its cadence consists of 4 heavy syllables (s u )vebhiḥ śúśmaiḥ.
