There is number disharmony between the 2nd plural enclitic vaḥ (a) and the voc. singular vánaspate (b).The simplest way to account for this is to assume that the voc. has simply been repeated from the 1st vs. of the hymn (1b) in this 1st vs. of the 2nd (half of the) hymn, which switches its subject from a singular post to plural posts.

Or Lord of the Forest may refer to the forest itself or a single tree that produces multiple posts.
