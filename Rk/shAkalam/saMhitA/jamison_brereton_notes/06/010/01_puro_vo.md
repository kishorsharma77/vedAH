In the lexeme puró √dhā, puráḥ serves as a pseudo-preverb; the phrase shows extreme distraction (pseudo-tmesis) here, with puráḥ initial in the 1st hemistich and dadhidhvam final in that hemistich. The phrase is then revitalized with puráḥ opening pāda c, thus directly adjacent to its verb though across a hemistich boundary. That the opening words of pāda c, purá ukthébhiḥ belong to the clause in the first hemistich is further shown by the abrupt clause boundary and change of subject in the middle of c, clearly signalled by a typical clause-initial sequence of PRN + Wackernagel-position particles, sá hí naḥ.

Pāda b has two extra syllables. The meter could be easily fixed by deleting agním with no ill effects to sense or metrical structure. This is an old idea (see Old’s reff., ZDMG 55.298), but though harmless, it may be better to accept the text as given (see Old, Noten ad loc.).

On suvṛktí- as a secondary bahuvrīhi, meaning ‘possessing/receiving (hymns) that possess a good twist’, see comm. ad II.4.1. This interpr. as a masc. adj. is imposed by the otherwise unbroken string of acc. sg. masculines: mandráṃ divyáṃ suvṛktím … agním. In the comm. ad II.4.1 I suggest that it can also have the primary bahuvrīhi meaning ‘having a good twist’, referring to Agni’s curls of smoke and flame. This would also be possible as an alternative or secondary reading here.

I take adhvaré as part of the loc. absol. prayatí yajñé, contra Ge. (Re seems to ignore the second loc.) Nothing much rides on either choice.
