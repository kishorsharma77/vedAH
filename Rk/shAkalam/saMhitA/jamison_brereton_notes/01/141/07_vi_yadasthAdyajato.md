I take this entire verse as dependent on vs. 6. It is full of rare and unclear words, but the pile-up of descriptors of the violently moving fire is exhilarating.

In b hvārá- (to √hvar ‘move crookedly, twist’; cf. hvárate in 1c) is taken by Ge and Re as ‘bird’, but I am persuaded by Roth’s suggestion, enshrined in Gr (and see Old [Noten]), that the referent is a snake -- the creature of “twisting/serpentine motion.” The quality held in common between the hvārá and fire is vákva-, derived from the root √vañc ‘undulate, curl, meander’, and the image is that of fire winding its way through the dried-up plants that serve as its fuel. From this tr. it is clear that I take jaráṇā as jaráṇāḥ, with the Pp., and as an acc. pl. fem. ‘old (things = plants’). Gr.

identifies it as an instr. sg., and this interpr. is followed by others (most recently by WG), but the sandhi situation, with -ā before a- essentially excludes it (though see Old [Noten] who finds it barely possible).

The sense of ánākṛta- is likewise unclear, though its formation is transparent.

The tr. of Old (SBE “whom it is not possible to drive to a place”; sim. Noten), Ge (“ohne Antrieb”), Re (“sans y avoir été poussé”) seem to reflect a sense of the common idiom ā́√kṛ ‘bring here’ extended to ‘push/force (here)’, with the ‘here’ elided. However, in his n. 7b, Ge adduces PB XXIII.13.4.5, which concerns wild animals that are anākṛta-. Caland tr. ‘unfostered’, but I see another possible extension of ‘brought here’, namely ‘kept here’ à ‘confined’, with its negative then ‘unconfined’. This certainly fits the PB passage and also matches Sāy’s gloss anivāritaḥ (Ge’s tr. ‘ungehemmt’).

The second hemistich is entirely couched in the gen., save for the loc. pátman ‘flight’ off which all those genitives hang. I construe pátman with ánākṛtaḥ in b.

Although ‘flight’ may seem to support the ‘bird’ interpr. of hvārá- in b, note that hvārá- is in a simile syntactically independent of the rest of the sentence; moreover, Dīrghatamas hardly feels constrained to confine himself to one image at a time.

dakṣúṣaḥ is a pseudo-perfect-participle, like the pseudo-desiderative-adjective dákṣu- (II.4.4) to √dah ‘burn’. Both are hapaxes.

On -jaṃhas- see comm. ad VI.12.2 and VI.3.5.

vyàdhvan- can contain either ví ‘without’ or ví ‘through, wide(ly)’ (so also Old [SBE], Re). I have opted for the latter, but others (Ge ‘wegelosen Flug’, WG ‘Wegelosen’) for the former. Either would work, though the phrase rája ā́seems to me to express extent of space and to favor my interpr.
