arājín- is a hapax. Though it is obviously derived from a root √rāj, it is not clear whether it belongs to ‘shine’ (so Gr ‘nicht glänzend’, Re ‘sans éclat’) or ‘rule’ (Ge ‘die herrenlosen Berge’; Old ‘königlos’) -- or both, as I suspect. Although neither root yields compelling sense as a negated quality of mountains, the phrase should be interpreted in light of 1c ví párvateṣu rājatha, where I see the same pun.

It is possible that ví √yā should be rendered ‘drive through’, not ‘drive apart’, although this produces a less happy contrast with sám in vs. 22. In that case I would tr. “they drove through Vṛtra, joint by joint, (drove) through the mountains …” On vṛ́ṣṇi see comm. ad VIII.96.19.
