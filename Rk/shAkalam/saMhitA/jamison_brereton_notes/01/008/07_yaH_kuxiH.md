Yet another untethered rel. cl. In my view, the description of Indra’s physical capacity serves as the basis for the expressions of Indra’s vast liberality and help in vss. 8-9, each of which begins with evá hí “for just in the same way.” Therefore the yáḥ ‘which’ of 7a seems a substitute for yáthā ‘even as’, the usual relative with evá.

Although I do not so translate it, 7-8 could be rendered “even as his cheek … swells …, even so is his liberality…” For kukṣí- as ‘cheek’, not ‘belly’, see Jamison 1987 (Gs. Cowgill).
