I render vs.-final kṛṇudhvam twice -- once with vs.-initial ā́in the meaning ‘make = kindle’, rather than with most tr. ‘bring here’, and once with the quasiinfinitival dat. ávase.

It is not entirely clear why Agni is identified as Rudra here. The word is most likely to be construed with the gen. adhvarásya as “the Rudra of the/your ceremony,” on the basis of I.114.4 rudráṃ yajñasā́dham “Rudra bringing the sacrifice to success” and III.2.5 (also of Agni) rudráṃ yajñā́nāṃ sā́dhadiṣṭim “the Rudra of the sacrifices, bringing success to the offerings.” Perhaps the point of comparison is Rudra’s healing powers and, esp. here, his ability to ward off threats of all sorts, in this case the “unexpected thundering” (tanayitnór acíttāt) of pāda c.

ródasyoḥ can be either gen. (with most tr.) or loc. (so publ. tr.). There is little riding on the choice.

As most interpr. take it, “unexpected thundering” is probably a reference to all sorts of unforeseen dangers, rather than specifically of a sudden storm.
