With Ge and Re, the publ. tr. interpr. páyo duhanti as “they milk your milk” (or more emphatically, Re “traient de toi le lait” [my ital.]); that is, they assume that milk (páyaḥ) here refers to the soma juice. See above, comm. ad vs. 9, on the ambiguous ref. of this word in the soma maṇḍala. It is also possible here that páyaḥ refers to cows’ milk (see the cows in 19c), and the passage should be interpr. “they milk milk for you for exhilaration.”
