The first hemistich introduces a note of aggression, but this quickly dissipates. The oppositional pair ‘straight’ (ṛjú-) and ‘crooked’ (vṛjiná-) recurs from vs. 18, where, unlike here, it was a morally neutral description of the paths across the sheep’s fleece filter.

I do not understand the doubling of abhí in pāda c, esp. since abhí seems to add little to this idiom.
