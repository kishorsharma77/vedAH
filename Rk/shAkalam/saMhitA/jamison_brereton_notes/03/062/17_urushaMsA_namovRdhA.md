The sense of the splv. instr. pl. drā́ghiṣṭhābhiḥ is unclear. This is the only occurrence of the superlative in the RV, and neither dīrghá- nor the cmpv.

drāghīyas- occurs in the instr. pl. The standard interpr., that the splv. here is temporal (Gr ‘in längster Dauer’), seems reasonable, but not assured.
