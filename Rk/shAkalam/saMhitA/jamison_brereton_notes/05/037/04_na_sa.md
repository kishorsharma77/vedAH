“Whose comrades are cows” (gósakhāyam) modifying soma refers of course to the milk mixture added to soma to make it less unpalatable. (It is somewhat surprising that sóma- is also called tīvrá- ‘sharp’ in the same pāda, since this is usually of unmixed soma.) But the gó- ‘cow’ of this cmpd provides a clever transition to the next pāda. Pāda c contains a verb (ā́…) ájati ‘drives’, which ordinarily takes an object -- and indeed frequently that object is cows: e.g., I.83.5 ā́ gā́ājat, V.2.5 ā́jāti paśváḥ. I therefore supply ‘cows’ as the object in c, extracted from a different use of the ‘cow’ word in b. This then produces a reference to the Vala myth, with the satvanaíḥ ‘warriors’ representing the Aṅgirases as elsewhere (cf. III.39.5, also nearby V.34.8 for association with cattle raiding). Thus pāda c depicts the king protected by Indra as performing a Vala-like deed (ā́satvanaír ájati) as well as the/a Vṛtra slaying (hánti vṛtrám), ascribing (equivalents of) the two signature deeds of Indra to this earthly king. Neither Ge nor WG make much sense of the ájati clause.

The accent on ájati is contrastive with the adjacent hánti.

Both Ge and WG take kṣitī́ḥ with kṣéti (“er bleibt in seinen Sitzen” and “weilt sicher in seinem Reich” respectively; see also Oberlies Relig. RV I.441, II.171-72), but √kṣi ‘dwell’ without preverb does not otherwise take the acc., whereas √puṣ ‘prosper, thrive’ can take a personal acc., and so I construe kṣitī́ḥ with púṣyan. In my interpr. the poet juxtaposes the cognate words (kṣéti kṣitī́ḥ), but separates them syntactically.
