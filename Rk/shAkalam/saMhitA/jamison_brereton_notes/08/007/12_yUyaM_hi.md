Ge and Re (see his comm.) take sudānavo, rúdrā ṛbhukṣaṇaḥ as predicative vocatives with the copula expression yūyáṃ hí ṣṭhā́“for you are …” This seems unnecessary, since there is a fine nominative plural, prácetasaḥ, which can serve as predicate. I take the utá to be connecting not the supposed predicative vocc.

with prácetasaḥ, but the two locc. dáme and máde. The predicative vocative analysis is esp. unlikely because this is a repeated pāda (I.15.2, VI.51.15, VIII.83.9; there are also further exx. of yūyám hí ṣṭhā́… as a pāda-opening), and only in I.15.2 is a predicative voc. likely. (See Bloomfield, RR ad I.15.2; he considers it “plain mechanical borrowing” there.) The conjoined locc. “in our house and in exhilaration” may not seem to form a natural semantic class, but note that they are anagrams of each other: dáme / máde, and in a hymn so structured by phonetics, that would be enough.
