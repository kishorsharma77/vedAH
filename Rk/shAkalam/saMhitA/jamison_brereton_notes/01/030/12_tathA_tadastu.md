Ge (WG) take iṣṭáye as “dass du rasch kommst,” without comment, but it is not clear to me what root they are using to produce ‘come quick’. There are several roots √iṣ to which iṣṭáye could belong: ‘seek, desire’ and ‘send’ are the most likely, along with the marginal root ‘prosper’ found in iṣáyati. A zero-grade of √yaj ‘sacrifice’ could (and does) also produce iṣṭí-. None of these comes close to ‘come quick’; my conjecture is that they are connecting it with ‘send’, but forms of this root are always transitive. Re more reasonably assigns it to the ‘seek’ root: “… que (tu) cherches (des biens pour nous),” but must supply much material for it to work. I suggest that it belongs to this same root, but in the sense ‘desire, want’, and that the message here is the mutually reinforcing “we want you to want what we want.” This expression is somewhat reminiscent of sá naḥ sanitā́sanáye in vs. 16: “he the winner, for us to win it,” though using two different but synonymous roots, rather than the etymological figure of 16.
