Heaven and Earth  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
5 verses: jagatī  
The various, and sometimes paradoxical, relationships between (masculine)  Heaven and (feminine) Earth, and their joint relationship with their sons, the  gods, are the topic of this hymn. The two are named in the first and last (5) verses  of the hymn, while in between they are only referred to by kinship terms. In the  first half of verse 2 their parental roles are kept separate:  father and mother,  but in the second half they are subsumed in a pregnant dual, “two fathers.” The  tables are turned in verse 3, where they appear as “two mothers.” Although both  of these duals are frequently used in the R̥gveda for the paired parents of both  genders (and such is their reference here), the alternation in this hymn seems  meaningful and contextually appropriate. Minds are not associated with either  gender exclusively, so that “the mind of the. . .father and of the mother” in verse  2ab belongs to each individually, whereas in 2c it is, properly, two fathers who  “possess good semen.” The reason for the feminine “two mothers” in verse 3 is  less clear, though as objects acted upon they may evoke the feminine. After these  various parental designations, the poet branches out in verse 4b, identifying the  two as both siblings and a married couple, with a subtle but unmistakable sug gestion of incest.  
In the meantime, the beloved paradox of children giving birth to their parents is  given full play in verses 3 and 4.  
As discussed in the introduction to I.160, this hymn is a virtual twin to the one  that follows.
