Agni  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
8 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 8  
The beginning and end of this hymn focus on the ritual fire and our relationship  to it. The poet begins (vs. 1) by presenting to Agni what he has produced, char acterized as an evolving product: an “insight...the thinking of my speech.” The  poet’s concern with his insight returns toward the end (vss. 6–7), where it is hoped  that Agni will pursue our speech and promote our insights. In between the hymn  touches on many of the standard Agni tropes: for example, the beauty and radiance  of the newly kindled fire (vss. 2–3) and its destructive power (vs. 5). It ends (vs. 8) by  begging for Agni’s protection.
