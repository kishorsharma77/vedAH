The verb pā́(ḥ) opening the 2nd half-vs. should also be read with (or supplied with) pāda b. Ge supplies “sei” for the first hemistich and construes the gen. phrase in b with upāké. This is possible but, given the parallelism of the two genitive phrases referring to soma in b and c, less likely.

Ge and WG take pṛṣṭhyà- lit. ‘related to the back’ as an adjective of (superior) quality in a spatial metaphor -- the sense of “top” in Cole Porter’s “You’re the top” or the adj. “tip-top.” Cf. WG’s “am erstklassigen Soma-Spross.” I think rather that the adj. is meant literally to refer to the soma plant’s well-known growing place, the back of the mountains (that is, the high slopes). Cf., e.g., V.36.2 rúhat sómo ná párvatasya prṣṭ̥ hé “as the soma-plant grows on the back of the mountain.”
