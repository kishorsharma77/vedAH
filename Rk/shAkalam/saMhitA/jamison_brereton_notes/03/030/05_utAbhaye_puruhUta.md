I am not certain how to construe śrávobhiḥ. The publ. tr. takes it with the voc. puruhūta: “much invoked with acclamations.” But I am not entirely happy about construing a full noun with a voc. that ordinarily stands alone (as in, e.g., 7d, 8a). Ge tr. “rühmlich,” which seems designed to be as untethered to the sentence as possible.

Re takes it with the speaking of pāda b: “… seul avec tes remons tu as parlé (un langage) ferme,” but I don’t understand what that means; WG like Re, except tr. “mit Ruhmes(taten),” which again I don’t follow.

I have given the idiom dṛḷhám √vad a mildly slangy turn (similarly in X.48.6); the collocation of a verb of speaking and an adverb referring to a physical quality seems to invite it. “Speak firmly” would be a more neutral rendering than “talk tough,” but pāda d, which describes heaven and earth as a mere “handful” for Indra, also seems to belong to a vivid and informal register.

The participial phrase vṛtrahā́sán contains, unusually, a non-concessive nominative of the pres. part. of √as ‘be’. It seems here to be definitional and to pick up and summarize 4b éko vṛtrā́cárasi jíghnamānaḥ “you alone range about [/keep] smashing obstacles.” As discussed immed. above, the redupl. pres. part. combined with a quasi-auxiliary depicts this as repetitive, indeed habitual, action -- and the ékaḥ indicates that only Indra engages in it. Our phrase here, vṛtrahā́sán, comes to the appropriate conclusion: since you and you alone keep smashing obstacles, you are The Obstacle-Smasher, par excellence.
