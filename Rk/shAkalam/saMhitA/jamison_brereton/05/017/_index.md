Agni  
Pūru Ātreya  
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5  
A striking image in this hymn is that of the mouth—the mouth of Agni, who  receives the offerings, and the mouth of the priest, who recites the hymns. The poet associates or even identifies these mouths in verse 2 by using ásya “of this one,” to  refer to either Agni or the priest, and in verse 5, where the mouth is equally that of  Agni and that of the priest. The poet insists on these two mouths because they are  the means by which the patron of the sacrifice can think himself glorious (vs. 2). In  verse 3, however, the poet refers only to the mouth of Agni and shifts to a sexual  image. The “thrust” could be the thrust of the poet’s song or it could be the thrust  of the fire-churning. Because it carries a sexual connotation, line c then describes  the semen of Agni that gives birth to lofty flames.
