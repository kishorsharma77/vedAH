With Ge I take c as an independent nominal cl. Re takes c as a continuation of ab, but as Ge points out (n. 2c) c is the Fortsetzung of the image in ab: in ab the chariots are presumably competing for prizes; the prizes or “takings” (bhára-) in c are what these chariots win. For the phrase in c see IX.16.5 mahé bhárāya kāríṇaḥ “for the great taking of the decisive victor.”
