Agni
Nodhas Gautama
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Two double aspects of Agni, touched on in the two previous Agni hymns by Nodhas  Gautama, are united in this brief hymn. On the one hand, Agni’s primal installation  in the sacrifice by the ancestors of humankind is contrasted with his regular re-instal lation by the current sacrificers (see esp. vs. 2ab, but also throughout). In fact, the orig inal theft of fire from heaven by Mātariśvan, who bestowed it on the legendary Bhr̥gu,  ends the first verse. In several places (2c, 3d, 4b, 4d) it is not possible to determine  from the verb form whether the poet is referring to the distant and legendary past or  the recent past of the current ritual, though unfortunately English imposes the choice.  The aorist forms in question often refer to the immediate past, and so we have trans lated them (“has been set down,” etc.), but an unmarked past (“was set down,” etc.)  is far from excluded. It is quite likely that the poet wished to leave the question open.
The other double aspect treated is Agni’s dual role in the sacrifice: he both acts  as priest and is the object of ritual activity by human priests. See especially verse  2b, where the Uśij (“fire-priests”) present oblations to him, and 4a, where Agni is  identified as an Uśij (as well as a Hotar, in 4b).
