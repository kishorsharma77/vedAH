Ge takes the dat. devátātaye with cd: “dass du für die Götterschaft mit Übermacht den Vṛtra erschlägst.” This has some immediate appeal, but I am reluctant to adopt it because both the hemistich-break and the yád intervene.

Moreover, the use of present tense háṃsi suggests that the Vṛtra-smashing continues in the present day and is perhaps separate from the primal act performed for the benefit of the gods in mythological time.
