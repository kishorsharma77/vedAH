Although the major problem in this vs. is the impossible hapax vinaṃgṛsáḥ in c, the puzzlement begins with b. What does it mean that Soma goes “across the dear bellow of the daughter of the Sun” (sū́ryasya priyáṃ duhituś tiró rávam), and in particular what is the daughter of the Sun doing here? She is found twice elsewhere in IX in the full phrase sū́ryasya duhitár-: at IX.1.6, where she purifies the soma, and IX.113.3, where she brings soma in the form of rain, as well as, most likely, named only as duhitár- in IX.97.47 (for which see below). Ge (see esp. n. 3b to IX.113.3) considers her “die Rede- und Gesangeskunst selbst,” on the basis of a dubious reading of III.53.15 (see comm. ad loc.), and so in our passage he interpr. her bellow as the song of the priests, which the noisy soma “übertönt” (n. 3b); Re partially follows him by supplying “au chant des prêtres” to gloss “à la chère rumeur de la Fille du soleil” in his tr., but supplies a verb of motion with tíraḥ: “(passant) outre,” though without comment. But Ge’s interpr. requires that tíraḥ ‘across’ when construed with a noun referring to noise can mean something like “(sing) over, drown out.” But when independent, tíraḥ always governs an expression of space, e.g., in IX tíraḥ rájāṃsi “across the realms” (IX.3.7-8), tíraḥ pavítram “across the filter” (IX.68.2, 109.16). Tellingly, tíraḥ is once used with an acc. of noise, calls, but these are conceived of spatially, as the calls of other sacrificers which the Aśvins should travel across to arrive at my sacrifice: VII.68.2 … gantam havíṣo vītáye me / tiró aryó hávanāni “come to pursue my offering / across the calls of the stranger.” There is, however, another, idiomatic, use of tírah, with the root √dhā in the meaning ‘hide (oneself), disappear’. An example is found in the next hymn, IX.73.3 maháḥ samudráṃ váruṇas tiró dadhe “As great Varuṇa, (Soma) has hidden himself in the sea.” Another is found in conjunction with the word duhitár-, identified above as another example of daughter (of the Sun) by most (incl. Ge, Re): IX.97.47 tíro várpāṃsi duhitúr dádhānaḥ “hiding himself in the forms of the daughter (of the Sun).” In that passage I identify the “forms of the daughter (of the Sun)” as the milk, so called because it is white and gleaming like the Sun; in other words, this is yet another version of the mixing of soma with milk. And I now further suggest that that is what we have here as well - that we should supply a form of √dhā to produce the same idiom we find more clearly in the next hymn and in IX.97.47. The sticking point is then rávam: what does it mean to “hide himself in the bellow of the daughter of the Sun”? I would suggest that it is an example of standard RVic breviloquence as well as synaesthesis. The “bellow” refers to the characteristic sound of cows, who were already mentioned (gā́ḥ) in the preceding pāda, so the phrase “the bellow of the daughter of the Sun” collapses the sound and the visual appearance associated with the milk=cows. I would now tr. the hemistich “Not stopping, he goes beyond (the filter) toward the cows, hid(ing himself) in the dear “bellow” of the daughter of the Sun [=milk].” There is comparatively little sensible to say about the hapax vinaṃgṛsá-, though it is possible to indulge in speculation. Perhaps the only truly sensible thing to note is that it is a partial anagram of the patronymic of the poet (Harimanta) Āṅgirasa: (vin)aṅgrsḁ -, and such phonological associations often drive the appearance of problematic forms. Sāy. glosses it stotā ‘praiser’ on the basis of context and a rather perfunctory stab at etymology. Ge renders it ‘arm’ on the basis of Naigh. 2.4 and, again, context: the mention of the fingers in the following pāda would support that interpr. But the word as we have it does not look analyzable acdg.

to Indo-Aryan morphological structure: save for the initial vi there is no sign of internal structure, and segmenting the vi does not produce anything that looks promising on the surface. As Ge points out (pace Old), the context is erotic. The initial ánu certainly belongs with jóṣam in the standard idiom ánu jóṣam “according to (one’s) pleasure,” with unaccented asmai intervening in Wackernagel’s position.

But with Ge (n. 3c) I would now also read it with abharat in the erotic idiom ánu √bhṛ ‘penetrate sexually, stick (one’s penis) in’, as discussed in my 1980 “A Vedic Sexual Pun: ástobhayat, anubhartrī́, and RV I.88.6” (Acta Orientalia 42) - though in that article (p. 59 n. 4) I more or less discounted this passage. Acdg. to this reading, asmai would be Soma and the recipient of the sexual act, while the vinaṃgṛsá- is the sexual actor. As noted in the publ. intro., erotic contexts often contain slang and twisted expressions that we cannot access.

At this point we leave the realm of even shaky evidence and enter that of pure speculation. Although the word we have cited is vinaṃgṛsáḥ, in its sandhi context it might also begin *dvi-: abharad vinaṃgṛsáḥ could be a degemination of abharad

*dvinaṃgṛsáḥ, of the type I have recently discussed in several publications (esp.

“False Segmentations and Resegmentations in the Rigveda: Gemination and Degemination,” forthcoming). There are no metrical implications. If we segment off dvi- ‘two, bi-’, naṃg- (/ naṅg-) could be analyzed as a metathetic taboo deformation of nagná- ‘naked’, of a type that the ‘naked’ word has often received across IndoEuropea. A cmpd with the meaning ‘having two naked …’ could refer to the arms of the presser (per Naigh. cited above, which cites vinaṃgṛsau as a dual and glosses bāhū) or to the pressing stones, and the sexual act would be the violent pressing itself. (If there is anything to this, the phrase nṛ́bāhubhyām coditáḥ “driven by the two arms of men” in 5a might be a reparative paraphrase.) Even by this flight of fancy I cannot figure out what to do with -ṛsa-, whose lack of ruki is another peculiar, non-Indo-Aryan-looking feature. And just to throw in another off-the-wall suggestion, in my 1980 article I suggested that the anubhartrī́- of I.88.6 was a veiled reference to the musical instrument, the vīnā-, and the beginning of our word vinaṃ(- grsḁ )- could be a play on that. None of this is worth much, which is why I leave the word untransl.

Having pronounced the word uninterpretable, Re simply ignores it in his tr., though curiously provides a fem. subject, presumably the daughter of the Sun: “elle lui offrait ses charmes,” a tr. of extreme erotic delicacy.
