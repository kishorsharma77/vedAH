Although huvé in c is morphologically problematic, its interpretation is imposed by context: a past-tense 3rd ps. ‘he called’. But this is the only 3rd ps. huvé (in contrast to over 70 exx. of 1st ps. huvé, -e), and it must be preterital not present, as huvé otherwise is. I have no explanation.

The referent of te ‘your’ in the same pāda is unclear. Assuming the relevant constituent is “your father’ (te … pitā́), te should refer to the poet, or some poet, in whose lineage “you” are, but I would expect the poet to be the 1st ps. speaker of the first huvé (pāda b). Perhaps the reference to the “ancient house” in pāda a indicates that another, more venerable poet is on the scene, whose model (and that of his forebears) the current poet is following. The publ. tr. of pāda a supplies “your” with “ancient house” - implying that the current poet is modeling himself on “you” and “your father,” but it should be remembered that the “your” of a is not explicit in the text. It could well be “my ancient house” (or indeed someone else’s). Though the pāda is repeated in VIII.69.18, that passage is not helpful in interpreting this one.

However, I.87.5 contains an occurrence of pratná- modifying father that seems to assert a similar entitlement to poetic speech by lineage: I.87.5 pitúḥ pratnásya jánmanā vadāmasi “We speak by virtue of our kinship with our primordial father.”
