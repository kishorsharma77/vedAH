Him (I invoke) for youâ€”the god sitting on the wood like a bird in a tree,  (like) the drop from the stalk in the wooden cup, snorting, shaving  (the ground), undulating,  
the conveyor (of the oblations) with his mouth like a draft-horse,  abundant with flame, like someone with a great commandment racing  along the ways.
