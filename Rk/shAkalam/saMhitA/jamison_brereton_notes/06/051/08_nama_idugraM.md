In this deliberately repetitive vs. (6 occurrences of námas-), it is difficult to render the repeated verbs ā́vivase (a, d) in the same way. As the desid. to √van, vivāsa-, esp. with ā́, means lit. ‘seek to win here’, hence ‘attract’, which is fine in pāda a. But with the object “committed offense” (kṛtám énaḥ) the sense is harder to manipulate. I take it as ‘win back’, hence ‘redeem’; Ge ‘abbitten’ (beg pardon, apologize), with no attempt to connect this tr. to the literal meaning or to the other occurrence of the verb in the passage; Re makes good use of his usual parentheses: “je l’attire (pour le détruire),” which evades the problem.
