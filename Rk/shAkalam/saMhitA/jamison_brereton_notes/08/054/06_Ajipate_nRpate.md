I take pāda a as a nominal clause, with b separate, in order to account for the unaccented verb in b following hí in a. This requires taking ā́jipate nṛpate as predicated vocatives, a rare but still attested construction; see, e.g., I.15.2. This should also require naḥ at the end of pāda a to be construed with that clause, which the publ. tr. does not do. I would now add “for us” after “lord of men” and in the second clause make “us” parenthetical. Ge takes ab as a single sentence, which avoids the predicated vocative but has an unaccented verb in a hí clause. Old mentions the problem but decides that the lack of accent can be attributed to faulty transmission of the Vālakhilya. This is of course possible.

Both Old and Ge accept the Kashmir ā́bhakṣi for ā́vakṣi, though Old admits that the latter also works. I do not see the need to change the text.

Although VIII.54 has little in common with VIII.53, note 6cd … hótrābhir utá devávītibhiḥ, sasavā́ṃso … and 53.7c … hótrābhir utá deváhūtibhiḥ, sasavā́ṃso …
