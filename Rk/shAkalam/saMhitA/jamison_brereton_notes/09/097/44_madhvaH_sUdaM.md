Note the (s)va repetition: mádhvaḥ ... pavasva vásva ... pavasva ...

svádasva ... pavasva.

As in IX.96.14 (see comm. ad loc.), I take the acc. with pavasva as expressing a transformation of soma into the substance expressed in the acc. This use of pavasva with the acc. contrasts with that of ā́pavasvā in pādas b and d, where ā́adds the sense ‘bring here by purification’ and the acc. expresses the materials thus obtained.

On sū́da- see comm. ad VII.36.3. I argue there that, contra most views, it belongs with the ‘sweet’ words, and in fact that in this passage svádasva … pávamānaḥ in c is a virtual gloss (or poetic repair) of sū́dam pavasva in a.
