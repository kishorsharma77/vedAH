As was noted just above, the hymn-summary quality of the evā́opening this vs. is not sufficiently represented. I would now alter the tr. to “Just in this way purify yourself …” The etym. figure madiró mádāya is reminiscent of matsaró mádāya in the previous tṛca (11d), and pāda-final mádāya is prominent in the first part of this hymn (5b, 10b, 11d, 15a).

The identity of the ‘water-grabber’ (uda-grābhá-) is unclear. The best suggestion, in my view, is Ge’s: Vṛtra. This interpr. entails an implicit identification of Soma with Indra here, but this is not unprecedented: see for ex. the passages in which Soma is called vṛtra-hán(tama)- (IX.1.3, 24.6), and note that in the 1st vs. of this tṛca (13c) Soma’s voice is compared to Indra’s. Sāy. suggests ‘cloud’, but why would Soma be fighting a cloud? Old has an ingenious, ritually oriented solution, whereby udagrābhá- does not identify the (to-be-)vanquished enemy, but rather the type of weapon Soma is using (the gen. thus depending directly on vadhasnaíh)- namely the ritual ladle (Wasserschöpfer). He uses the power of water to vanquish an unexpressed enemy, namely “die feindlichen Mächte.” Although Old rejects the possibility that udagrābhá- refers to Vṛtra, in part because too much would need to be supplied, in fact by his interpr. the hostile object itself would have to be supplied.

His solution also does not mesh with passages like I.165.6 víśvasya śátror ánamam vadhasnaíḥ “I bowed with my weapons (those) of every rival,” which has the exact syntactic configuration of our passage.

The expression in pāda c, “encompassing the glistening color,” presumably refers to Soma’s incorporating the gleaming white milk - rendered clearly, if nonliterally, by Ge’s “weisse Farbe annehmend.”
