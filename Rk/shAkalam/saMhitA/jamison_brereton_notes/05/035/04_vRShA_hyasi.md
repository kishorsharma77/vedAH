The syntactic boundaries do not coincide with the pāda boundary in ab -- a welcome syncopation in this otherwise simple hymn. The hemistich is divided into three clauses: vṛ́ṣā hy ási / rā́dhase jajñiṣé / vṛ́ṣṇi te śávaḥ, but the pāda boundary breaks the second into two one-word halves. It might be possible to fold the third proposed clause into the second (“you were born as bullish strength”), if we were willing to be cavalier about the position of te and indeed its presence (“you were born as your bullish strength”?), but the nominal clause in VIII.3.10 tád indra vṛ́ṣṇi te śávaḥ supports the analysis as a separate unit, if more support be needed. On the anomalous form vṛ́ṣṇi (for expected vṛ́śn(y)am), see comm. ad VIII.96.19.

satrāhám is a neut. sg. qualifying paúṃsyam. It looks like a them. neut. and is in fact classified under satrāha- in Gr and Lub (see also Scar 697). Nonetheless, it belongs with the class of root noun cmpds with -hán-. The neut. sg. of such a stem should probably be *-ha (like nā́ma to nā́man-, assuming radical -n-stems work like, or get assimilated to, derived -n-stems). I might tentatively suggest that the final -m was first inserted (as anunāsika) to avoid the hiatus *satrāhá indra and then reinterp.

as a them. neut. ending (see also Lanman, Noun inflection 478, AiG III.239). But it is the case that such nasalizations are rare within pādas and almost always concern long

-ā (see Old, Prol. 469-72). Moreover, the similarly formed neut. vṛtrahám in
VI.48.21 precedes a consonant with the -m making position.
