Vāyu and Indra As in the preceding hymn, vs. 1 is addressed only to Vāyu, with single voc., but the rest of the vss. address them jointly, in three different ways. In 2a we have a reverse Vāyav Indraś ca construction índraś ca vāyo, in 3a the same construction in normal order, and in 4d the dual dvandva voc. índravāyū found in 46.3-7.
