As indicated in the publ. intro., I take this verse as the speech of Indra’s mother, picking up from the dialogue in vss. 1-2 that began (1a) jajñānó nú “just born,” which is echoed here by sadyó jātáḥ (“just born right now”). In VIII.45.4 Indra took the Bunda bow just before his dialogue with his mother, and in VIII.69.14-15 he's a tiny child when he gets the porridge and cooks the buffalo for his mother and father.

I supply odanám ‘rice porridge’ as the object of ā́bhara (and áttave). Note that in the summary verse 10 various foodstuffs, including odanám, are objects of ā́bharat.

The inclusion of ‘ladies’ (nā́ribhyaḥ) alongside superior men (nṛ̥bhyaḥ) is quite rare in the RV. See I.43.6, where it seems to refer to humankind in general.

Here it seems to have a more restricted sense and could actually refer to the gods and their wives: nṛ́- is often used of divinities. For goddesses beside gods see nearby VIII.80.10, though it is attributed to a different poet.

The voc. ṛbhuṣṭhira is a little surprising. Both Gr and Ge take it as implicitly comparative: Gr ‘stark, tüchtig wie Ṛbhu’, Ge ‘… stark wie die Ṛbhu’s’. I take it rather as parallel to ṛbhukṣán- ‘master of the Ṛbhus’, which is regularly an epithet of Indra.
