Although the first hemistich begins with a rel. pron. (yā́m) and the second with a form of sá/tám (tásmin), this is not a rel. cl. / main cl. structure, as the difference in gender between yā́m and tásmin shows. The latter has Indra as referent, and the former, which modifies dhíyam ‘poetic vision’ in b, is loosely picked up by bráhmāni … ukthā́“sacred formulations and hymns” in the main clause. In fact, I think the referent slippage is deliberate, with bráhmāṇi being the culminating product in our day of the age-old dhī́of ab, attributed to legendary priest-poets. Recall that this verse is in ring-compositional relationship with vs. 1, where a brahmán- creates poetry in the new style. ## 081 Indra
