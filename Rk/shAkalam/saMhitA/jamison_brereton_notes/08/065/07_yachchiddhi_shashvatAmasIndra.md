The balance of opinion (Gr, Kü, Lub, etc.) takes apīpema to √pī ‘swell’, which morphologically makes sense. But Ge seems to take it rather as a redupl. aor.

to √pā ‘drink’ (“Wir haben ihn … hier getränkt…”), though without explicitly saying so. See also the very parallel passage VIII.99.1, with ápīpyan. Despite the difficulties (amply treated by Kü), I prefer to associate these two forms with √pā.

The transitive -áya-formation pāyáyati ‘makes drink’ is well attested in the RV. It is a little difficult to figure out what a corresponding reduplicated aorist should look like. Since √pā is not an orthodox long-ā root, it doesn’t make a p-causative (type sthāpayati) and therefore would not import the -p- into the redupl. aorist (type átiṣṭhipat). One might expect, based on its -áya-stem, to produce *ápīpayat if thematic (type dīdharat) and *ápīpet (type dīdhar[t]) if athematic, with the weak form to be expected *ápīpima. Whether the form belongs to pī or pā, the full-grade in the root syllable of this form must be secondary, and if it’s not a problem to extend the full grade to the weak form of pī, it should likewise be unproblematic with pā. It is true, however, that the ‘swell’ root is possible and that the forms of the perfect of √pī and the putative redupl. aor. of √pā would be hopelessly mixed up formally and not terribly separate semantically. For ápīpyan in VIII.99.1 see disc. there.
