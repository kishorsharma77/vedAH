Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins with two verses establishing the sacrificial context, the second of  which describes the pressing stones as enthusiastic participants in the ritual. The  remaining verses celebrate Indra’s deeds and powers and beg him to display these  powers for our benefit. Verses 3 and 4 treat previous deeds, verses 6–7 primarily his  incomparable power.
The most striking verse is 5, the middle verse (vs. 10 being a refrain and thus  extra-hymnic). Here various threats to the “truth” of our people are rendered help less by our resistance and Indra’s power: threats internal to the community, namely  sorcerers and flatterers, and the “stranger” (an Ārya but an enemy), people who  deviate from our ways, and phallus-worshipers (presumably non-Āryas) outside it.
The final two verses before the refrain (8–9) recognize Indra’s help in the past  and request it for the future.
