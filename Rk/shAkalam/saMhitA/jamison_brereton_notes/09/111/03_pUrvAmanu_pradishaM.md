There appears to be a pun on raśmíbhiḥ in b; the word means both ‘reins’ and (metaphorically) ‘rays’, and in fact the extended meaning is more common in the RV than the original literal one. Here both Ge and Re render only the sun’s rays sense (e.g., “avec les rayons (solaires)”), and this sense is certainly there, prompted by Soma’s eastern journey in pāda a, as well as the comparison to the sun in 1c. Cf., with the same verb, V.37.1 sáṃ bhānúnā yatate sū́ryasya “He aligns himself with the radiance of the sun.” But the repeated phrase darśató ráthaḥ (b, c) “chariot lovely to see” suggests that the ‘rein’ sense is also here. But the distinction is somewhat muddled in practice, since the “heavenly chariot” of c is most likely the sun, with which Soma is being identified.

Pāda f contains a non-overt Vāyav Indraś ca construction: vájraś ca yád bhávathaḥ “when (you) and the mace become …” The 2nd du. verb bhávathaḥ presupposes a 2nd ps. Soma (expect voc. soma), conjoined with the nom. vájraḥ by ca.
