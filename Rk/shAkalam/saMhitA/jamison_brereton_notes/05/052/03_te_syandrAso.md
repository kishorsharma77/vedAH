As Ge points out, the verb áti √skand ‘spring across/beyond’ is reminiscent of ádhi √skand, which refers to sexual mounting. He supplies a parenthetical “(auf die Kühe)” in the simile (so also Re), and I would now also do so: “they spring across the nights, as streaming bulls spring (upon cows).” The meaning ‘night’ for the rare and etymologically unclear (see EWA s.v.; also WG n., with more confidence in the etym.) śárvarī- seems established by later Vedic and MIA evidence, but I do not know why the word appears in this passage. A fem. word for night is necessary to make the implicit sexual pun work, but the better attested rā́trī- is of course also fem. It somewhat responds phonologically to likewise pāda-final śáśvataḥ in 3b, and it therefore might form a web, along with syand(rā́saḥ) … ṣkand(anti) earlier in the hemistich -- but the phonological connections seem too slight. Maybe Śyāvāśva just likes words that begin with his initial.

I am not certain what image is being conveyed. Ge suggests that the Maruts’ storms calm down at night and then take on renewed energy in the morning, but the two passages he adduces don’t seem to support that interpr. Moreover, ‘spring across/beyond’ seems to me the opposite of what Ge envisions: it’s a vigorous action not a relaxation into tranquility. I tentatively suggest that it refers to the fact that thunderstorms (or, rather, the associated lightning flashes) are especially visible at night and appear to streak across the dark sky.
