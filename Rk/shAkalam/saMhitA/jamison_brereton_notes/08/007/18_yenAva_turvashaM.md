Note the extremely recessive 2nd pl. perfect āvá: 2nd pl. pfs. are rare and poorly marked as it is; with its initial swallowed by yéna, this one barely surfaces.

The referent of yéna and its correlative tásya is most likely ‘help’ (ávas-); so Ge. This assumption is supported by I.112.5 yā́bhiḥ káṇvam … ā́vatam “with which you two helped Kaṇva,” where the referent of yā́bhiḥ is the etymologically related ūtíbhiḥ and the same Kaṇva story as in 18b is referred to.

As for Turvaśa and Yadu -- though, as Ge points out, their helper is usually Indra, in this run of hymns the deed is assigned to several different gods: the Maruts (here), Indra (VIII.4.7), the Aśvins (VIII.9.14, 10.5).

The construction of c is unusual. With Ge (and Re), I take tásya as a partitive gen. with dhīmahi, though somewhat reluctantly. The dat. rāyé ‘for wealth’ is then an indication of our purpose once we receive some help from the Maruts; Ge’s fuller “um Reichtum (zu gewinnen)” makes the purpose clearer.
