Indra
Agniyuta (or Agniyūpa) Sthaura
9 verses: triṣṭubh
A fairly straightforward hymn that remains focused on its insistent themes: the  invitation to Indra to drink the soma, and the expectations we have of him after  he has done so. The first four verses issue the invitation; verses 5–6 ask Indra to  use the strength imparted by our soma to defeat our enemies, while the invita
tion is reiterated in verses 7–8. The hymn proceeds in part by verses paired in  theme and language, though verses 3–4 do not show the repetitions and patterned  variation in the other three pairs. The final verse (9) summarizes the poet’s work  while ending with a striking image of the gods as dice, giving (and presumably also  withholding) luck.
