Pūṣan As noted in the publ. intro., the hymn is structured by an ever-shifting lexical chain. The links are as follows: vs. 1 rathī́ḥ -- 2 rathī́tamam / 2 rāyáḥ sákhā́yam -- 3 rāyáḥ ... sákhā / 3 ajāśva -- 4 ajā́śvam / 4 svásur ... jāráḥ -- 5 svásur jāráh. For the last vs. which lacks a precise repetition, note bhrā́tā in 5 phonologically echoed by bíbhrataḥ ending 6, although they are of course lexically unrelated. We might also note that the verb in 1b, sacāvahai ‘let us two accompany each other’, is echoed by the ‘companion’ word sákhi- in vss. 2, 3, and 5, and ajá- ‘goat’, found in the cmpd.

ajā́śva- ‘having goats as horses’ of vss. 3-4, reappears in 6 without the horses.
