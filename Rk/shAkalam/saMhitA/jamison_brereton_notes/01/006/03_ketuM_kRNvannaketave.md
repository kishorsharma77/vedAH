The baffling part of this verse is the voc. plural maryāḥ ‘o young men’ in b, embedded in a verse that otherwise has 2nd singular reference (ajāyathāḥ c, along with sg. ptcpl. kṛṇván in a). There is no clear referent for this voc., though it may refer to the unidentified plural subjects of the verbs in vss. 1-2 (yuñjánti) and 4 (eriré). In the plural márya- is often used of the Maruts, which may account for the Anukramaṇī identification of them as divinities of the hymn. Though Ge suggests they may constitute the audience for the singer and Re that they are the singers themselves, this seems unlikely because when márya- has an identifiable referent, it is never a human. I tentatively assume that it refers to the Aṅgirases as the firepriests who first kindled Agni, the subject of the verse.

As for the subject of ajāyathāḥ, contrary to most interpretations I take this as primarily referring to Agni, not the sun, though perhaps, with Re, “Agni solaire.”
