Indra and Agni As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn is made up of four tṛcas, which were probably originally independent, since four 3-vs. hymns would fit the standard pattern of hymn arrangement, but a single 12-vs. hymn following one with 8 vss.

would not. There is little sign of unity within the separate tṛcas, but the content of the hymn as a whole is so generic that it would be hard to identify features that would either unify or distinguish the various parts. Also, there may be a faint, probably secondary, ring between the 1st vs. (1c) and the last (12d) (see comm. ad vs. 12), which may suggest that the four tṛcas were combined into a single hymn even before the redaction of the Saṃhitā text. The first tṛca (vss. 1-3) also has a faint sign of internal unity: the dual dvandva voc. índrāgnī beginning the b-pāda in each vs. However, the 3rd tṛca (vss. 7-9) also contains the same form in every vs. (7a, 8c, 9c), and 10b also begins with this cmpd., though there it is not a voc. but an acc., and it requires a distracted reading (indrā̆-agnī́-).
