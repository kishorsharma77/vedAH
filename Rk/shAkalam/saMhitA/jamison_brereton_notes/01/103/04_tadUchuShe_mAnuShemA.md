The syntax and purport of this verse are somewhat murky, and my interpretation differs from the various other standard ones (though it is closest to Re).

I will only present mine here, without cataloguing the differences from the others.

First, I take tád ūcúṣe as a separate clause, with a new clause beginning in the middle of pāda a with mā́nuṣemā́yugā́ni, which I take as an acc. of extent of time, as it is several times elsewhere (e.g., II.2.2).

The rest of the verse concerns the epithets or “names” Indra has and, in part, how he acquires them: maghávan- ‘bounteous’ in b, vajrín- ‘mace-bearer’ in c, and sūnúḥ (śávasaḥ) ‘son (of strength)’ in d. On Indra’s acquisition of a sequence of names, see also VIII.80. I take c as containing the predication of the main clause, with the pres. part. upaprayán functioning as the main verb (see I.102.5 above).

The referent of tád in the first clause is unclear. Though it may be nā́ma, as most tr. think, I’m inclined to take it as an internal reference to the hymn that the poet is presenting to him.

In d the expected epithet “son of strength” is truncated, lacking the śávasaḥ, but the phonologically and derivationally parallel śrávase that immediately follows sūnúḥ would evoke it.

On this verse as an omphalos, see publ. intr.
