The versions pattern closely together despite variant semantics: (aj)irā́so / (rath)irā́so hárayo yé te … (a); vā́tā… /...vā́tasya … (b); yébhir ... mánuṣaḥ (c); yébhiḥ (...) svàr … (d).

The poor transmission of the Vālakhilya is probably responsible for the faulty accent of nighóṣayaḥ (for *nighoṣáyaḥ)(so Old). There is also unnecessary doubling of the preverb ní (which does not affect the meter, however).
