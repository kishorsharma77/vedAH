Indra  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Most of the hymn is devoted to generic praise of Indra, and especially of his immense  proportions (see the nicely balanced rhetoric of the middle verse 3). The last verse and  a half (4cd, 5) turn to the ritual situation, the early-morning soma-pressing for Indra.
