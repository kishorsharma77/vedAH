The phrase dívā ná náktam is universally taken as “by night as by day” (that is, “always,” as Sāy points out), with a very extended sense of the simile marker ná. I take ná rather as the homonymous negative: “by day, not by night.” This would reflect the simple fact that the ritual fire is kindled only in the morning and draw attention to the oddity of this practice, since in everyday terms fire is more needed and desired at night, for light and warmth. The position of ná allows either interpr.: it is in expected 2nd position for a simile, but in my interpr. it immediately precedes the word it negates, which is standard when ná is not a sentential negation, but negates a single word in a clause.

I render the verb in this clause as preterital, in keeping with the Pp. reading yúvā ajani. However, to match the presential saparyátaḥ of pāda a and the generality of the statement about his birth it would be possible to read (without emending the Saṃhitā text) yuvā jani, with an injunctive, which could have presential/timeless sense: “he is born …”
