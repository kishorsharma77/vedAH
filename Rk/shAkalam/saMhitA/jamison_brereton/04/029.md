Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
5 verses: triṣṭubh
A fairly straightforward invitation and journey hymn. Indra is urged to drive to  our sacrifice, ignoring rival pressers, to drink soma jointly with us, and, as usual, to  provide us with help and with wealth.
## 1
Praised, o Indra, with your fallow bays drive here right up to us, with  prizes and with help, to find exhilaration for yourself;
(drive) even across the many pressings of the stranger, being hymned by  songs, as one whose benefit is real.
## 2
For the manly one, ever attentive, drives here, when being called by the  pressers to the sacrifice—
he who, with his good horses, thinking himself non-frightening, becomes  exhilarated along with the heroes who have pressed the soma.
## 3
Cause his ears to hear—to rouse him, to make him reach exhilaration  following our pleasing instruction.
Boiling up and over for our benefit, powerful Indra will make
fearlessness and good fords for us.
## 4
He who will come here with his help to a man in distress, to an inspired  poet who calls and hymns just so—
the mace-bearer putting his swift (horses) to the chariot-pole in person— hundreds and thousands (of them).
## 5
Aided by you, bounteous Indra, might we—inspired poets and patrons— hymning (you) be yours,
for your giving of desirable (wealth) consisting of much livestock, as we  receive our share of the wealth coming from lofty heaven.
