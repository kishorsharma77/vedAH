My unsignalled addition, “your,” to the nominal cl. of c is unsupported and, I’m now sure, wrong. (It mindlessly follows Ge.) As noted ad vs. 3, Soma is always in the 3rd ps. in this hymn till the final vs. And the initial asyá of pāda a reinforces this. I would now change the tr. to “… are his joys.” As in the previous vs., the 4-syl. last pāda is a self-contained subord. cl., juṣánta yát, with víśve devā́ḥ of b as its subj. Note that juṣánta picks up sajóṣasaḥ in a, which modifies víśve devā́ḥ. The etymological responsion might have better conveyed by a more literal tr., such as ‘of joint pleasure, sharing pleasure’.
