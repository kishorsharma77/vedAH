I supply loc. upahvaré(ṣu) in a because ádhi doesn’t take the genitive (so can’t be directly construed with girīṇā́m as Ge does), on the basis of the immediately preceding hymn VIII.6.28 upahvaré girīṇā́m and the Marut hymn I.87.2 upahvaréṣu yád ácidhvaṃ yayím, whose phraseology is very close to this.

I do not entirely understand what iva is doing here. Perhaps their wandering in the distant parts of the mountains is implicitly compared to their journey here.

As in VIII.6.38 (q.v) I take svāná- as a pun, both a passively used root aor.

mediopassive participle to √su ‘press’ (‘being pressed’), which is eminently appropriate for drops, and a thematic adj. to √svan ‘sound’. Although the latter may seem less characteristic of drops, see 16a drapsā́iva … dhámanti “like droplets they blow their blast,” as well as 17a, where svāná- seems to encapsulate the same pun.
