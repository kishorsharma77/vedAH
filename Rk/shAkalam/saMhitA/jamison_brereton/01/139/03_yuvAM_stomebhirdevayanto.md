O Aśvins, the Āyus, seeking the gods, with their praise songs are causing  you two to hear, as if making the signal-call (of the pressing stone)  
heard—the Āyus (are causing) you two (to hear) about the oblations.  

In you two are all splendors and nourishments, o you who grant all  possessions.  
The wheel-rims on your golden one spray (honey)—on your golden  chariot, wondrous ones.
