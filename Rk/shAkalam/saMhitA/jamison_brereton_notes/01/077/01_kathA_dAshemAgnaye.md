All tr. take the kṛṇóti in d as if it were ā́kṛṇóti as in 2b, with the meaning “attract the gods hither.” But the ā́√kṛ idiom in vs. 2 is medial, and there is no ā́here.

I prefer to take kṛṇóti as a dummy verb, standing for yájati, extracted from yájiṣṭhaḥ ‘best sacrificer’. Hence “does so,” that is “sacrifices.” This also helps account for the íd.
