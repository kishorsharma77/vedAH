The first pāda is a bare variant of 3d: both contain the complex verbal construction vṛdhé √bhū ‘be for strengthening / be there to strengthen’, each with the complement enclitic naḥ. The only difference is the placement of the impv.: initial bhávā in 3d, final bhava in 11a, differing only in accent and, possibly, in the length of the final vowel: the Pp. resolves the cross-pāda sandhi bhavéndra with short bhava, like 10d, but a long vowel would be equally possible.
