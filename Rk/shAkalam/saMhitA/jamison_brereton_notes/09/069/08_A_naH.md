he suggests rather three (later) soma vessels: droṇakalaśa, ādhavanīya, and pūtabhṛt, none of which is found in the RV (though dróṇa and kaláśa- individually are both soma vessels). Ge in both passages (IX.1 n. 8c, IX.70 n. 8d) suggests soma juice, milk, and water. Re tr. “est fabriqué de trois manières,” but does not pronounce on what they are. Since mádhu ‘honey’ is normally a stand-in for sóma- in this maṇḍala, “the honey is made threefold” (tridhā́tu mádhu kriyate) seems to refer to a three-part division of the soma itself. However, the similar phrase in IX.86.46, mádaḥ pári tridhā́tuḥ … arṣati “the exhilarating drinks rushes around threefold,” gives me pause, in that it seems to refer to a single incident of soma’s rushing and is difficult therefore to parcel out to the three pressings. I therefore think that Ge’s suggestion that it refers to a liquid made up of three parts—soma juice, water, and milk—is probably correct, certainly at IX.86.46 but probably here and in IX.1.8 as well. “Three-backed” (tripṛṣṭhá-) in nearby IX.71.7 may belong here too and also perhaps the three heads (trī́n … mūrdhnáḥ) of IX.73.1.
