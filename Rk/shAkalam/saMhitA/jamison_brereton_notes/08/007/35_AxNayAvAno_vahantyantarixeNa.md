I take the final word of the vs., váyaḥ, as a pun, both nom. pl. ‘birds’ and neut. acc. sg. ‘vital energy’, with the birds subject of vahanti in pāda a. Birds figure in several nearby hymns (VIII.3.23, 5.33), with the latter passage esp. close: ... vām ...

váyo vahantu parṇínaḥ “Let your feathered birds [=horses] convey you two [=Aśvins] here.” Ge instead takes the obj. of vahanti here to be the Maruts’ horses (supplied), with the Maruts themselves presumably the subj. Scar (415-16) has the Maruts as subj. and clouds as obj., but in the absence of any clouds in the context, it seems better not to invent them. The disadvantage to my proposal is that the ‘birds’ reading of váyaḥ has to leap backwards over a nominal clause (dhā́tāra stuvaté …) that clearly has the Maruts as its nominal referent. Nonetheless, I think this kind of syntactic manipulation is possible in punning: the audience reaches the end of the verse and realizes that ‘birds’ is the subject they were missing at the beginning, while also interpretating váyaḥ as the neut. object of dhā́tāraḥ.

I am tempted to take dhā́tāraḥ as a periphrastic future: “they will establish …”
