Dānastuti of Praskaṇva (1–4), Agni and Sūrya (5)
Prṣ̥ adhra Kāṇva
5 verses: gāyatrī 1–4, paṅkti 5
Like the preceding hymn, this is more likely a dānastuti by Praskaṇva of his patron  Dasyave Vr̥ka (once again mentioned in vs. 1) than of Praskaṇva. The hymn follows  the general pattern of VIII.55: the generosity of the patron is praised in the first  verse, and the details of the gifts follow, especially in verses 3 and 4. The latter verse  describes the presentation of an adorned female whose identity is disputed, as the  readings of the R̥gveda and the khila collections differ. Some scholars consider her  to be Pūtakratu’s wife, thus the patron’s mother or stepmother, but the daughter of  Pūtakratu’s wife (following the R̥gveda reading with some minor adjustment), the  patron’s sister or half-sister, might make more sense. The final verse (5) to Agni and  Sūrya marks the moment of the kindling of the ritual fire at sunrise, when the ritual  gifts are distributed.
