This verse also contains some semantic incongruities: “kindling the footstep” is of course a curious expression, and that poets, presumably human, perform this action on the “highest footstep of Viṣṇu,” usually an expression for highest heaven, makes it all the odder. Ge (also Old, WG) plausibly identify “the highest footstep of Viṣṇu” here as the sun, and the verse would therefore express the common notion that priests kindling the ritual fire at dawn cause the sun to shine.
