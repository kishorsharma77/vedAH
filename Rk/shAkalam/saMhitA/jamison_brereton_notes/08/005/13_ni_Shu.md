The Pp. analyses yā́viṣṭam as yā́áviṣṭam, with the latter an injunc. -iṣ-aor.

to √av ‘help, favor’. Ge accepts this analysis and Re is sympathetic; however, Old dismisses it, taking yā́viṣṭam rather to √yu ‘unite’, as the verbal counterpart (with initial preverb ní) of the common noun niyút- ‘team’. This analysis is already found in Gr and is vigorously defended by Narten (Sig. Aor. 212). One argument against the Pp. interpr. is the fact that this would produce an unambiguous embedded relative clause, and these are rare to non-existent in the RV.
