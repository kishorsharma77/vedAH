With Ge and Re, I take kármabhiḥ as referring to the various ritual acts at the Soma Sacrifice. Oberlies (Relig.RV I.534) instead sees these as Indra’s deeds, after the weakened god has been reinvigorated by soma: “… lassen den Indra mit [=zu] seinen Taten wachsen.” This seems farfetched to me, given how frequently forms of √kṛ are used for ritual activity.
