On this verse as an expression of the Tānunāptra ritual see Proferes 2007: 59.

The verse begins with a form of the resonant idiom sám √jñā ‘come to an agreement, act in harmony” that was so important in Parāśara’s Vaiśvānara cycle (see I.68.8, 69.9 and disc. there and in Jamison Fs. Klein 2016). Here it expresses the unity not of all men, as in the Vaiśvānara cycle, but of the gods, even including their wives. Or so I interpret it; Ge and Re thinks the group includes both gods and men.

This seems unlikely to me, in part because pátnīvant- only qualifies gods (except for pressed soma drinks in VIII.93.22). As I have discussed elsewhere, I do not think that the Sacrificer’s Wife later called pátnī was yet established in the ṚV; she was only being introduced (and this introduction contentious) in the latest strata of the text.

Most tr. take ririkvā́ṃsas tanvàḥ kṛṇvata svā́ḥ to mean “having abandoned their former bodies, they took on their own (new bodies),” but this is somewhat incoherent: were their old bodies any less “their own” than the putative new ones? Proferes’s tr. (p. 59) seems self-contradictory, “Having yielded their bodies, they made [their bodies] their own,” but his explanation makes sense of this: they “overcome their atomization by relinquishing their ‘bodies’ in the course of a fire rite; they thus make their own (svā́ḥ) the collectivity of their own individual bodies, which is to say that each individual within the group identifies with the ‘bodies’ of all the others.” By taking kṛṇvata as reciprocal, as I do, rather than just reflexive, this sense can be found in the passage directly.
