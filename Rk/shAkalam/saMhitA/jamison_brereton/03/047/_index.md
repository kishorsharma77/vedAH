Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This ritually focused hymn is appropriate to the Midday Pressing, where Indra  drinks soma in company with the Maruts. Both Indra and the Maruts are  named in every verse, and all but the final verse contain an imperative of the verb “drink.” The Maruts’ role in strengthening Indra for his various exploits is  treated in verses 3–4.
