The lexeme ánu √as is fairly uncommon, but Agastya uses it twice elsewhere (I.167.10, I.182.8); the rather more common ánu √bhū can mean ‘be devoted to’ (< ‘follow’), and that seems to be the sense here.

Most interpr. take átapyamāne as ‘free from suffering’, but the more literal meaning of √tap ‘be hot, scorch’ seems appropriate in the solar context I see here.

In “the pair among the gods” (ubhé devā́nām), referring to Heaven and Earth, ubhé ‘pair’ is dual, while in “along with the pairs among the days” (ubháyebhir áhnām) ‘pairs’ (ubháyebhiḥ) is plural. This is presumably because Heaven and Earth are a unique pair, whereas the two day-halves, Day and Night, are recurrent and can be thought of as multiple pairs -- though the dual can also be used of them, as in áhanī in 1d.
