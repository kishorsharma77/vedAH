As noted in the publ. intro., Indra’s most characteristic epithet, “Vṛtra/obstaclesmasher,” is here applied to Soma instead -- another ex. of identity trading. The gerundive anumā́dya-, which was ambiguously used in 4c for either Soma or Indra or both, may signal the blurring of identity between them here.
