The verb ā́dat ‘took’ is superficially active, though the idiom ā́√dā ‘take’ is ordinarily middle. As was seen already by Wackernagel, the form must be a remarked form of the older 3rd sg. middle root aor. The underlying form would be *ā́da, which can represent either an old -t-less 3rd sg. mid. ending (as in impf. *áduha à áduha+t) or, more likely, the simplification by degemination of an old *ā́d+ta with an originally -t-full ending. Of course this preform should have yielded *ā́tta, but the fact that all other forms of the root aor. have a single d- (ádāt, etc.) could have induced the geminate to simplify (in this metrically non-diagnostic position after ā) and restore the d of the root. (Kü [Stativ 50-51] bases the -d-form on 3rd pl. ā́diran*.) In any case the t-less *ā́da would have been activized like the t-less middle imperfects of the áduhat type. The resulting “active” stem could spread elsewhere; cf. 1st pl. ā́dāma in nearby V.30.15. For disc. and previous lit. see Kü ref. above. The form is very differently explained by Old, who assigns it to ā √dṛ ‘tear out’ by way of the sandhi form *ā́daḥ (< 2nd/3rd sg. *ā́dar) and what seems to me a somewhat sketchy remarking with -t (as if 2nd sg. = *ā́das, so 3rd sg. should = *ā́dat?). The morphological machinery required seems too complex for its purpose, to avoid a slightly aberrant use of ā́√dā, and since ā́√dṛ doesn’t take personal objects (Old finds one late ex.), its usage here would be aberrant as well. Ge assigns it to ā́√dā, as do WG (with ref. to Kü, Stativ).

For the third time in the hymn, Vṛtra is described as śáyānam ‘lying’, each time in the same pāda-final position (2c, 6a, 8a), and pāda-final níṣattam (5a) ‘sunk, lit. sitting, down’ may be a sort of semantic pun on this positional characterization. In I.32, the Indra-Vṛtra hymn with clear phraseological and thematic parallels to this one, √śi ‘lie’ is also Vṛtra’s signature verb, esp. describing his position after his defeat, rather than before, as here.

Ge suggests that árṇam is an anticipatory haplology (not his term) for

*arṇapám ‘drinking the flood’, immediately before madhupám. He is followed by
Scar (313 n. 444) and WG. I see no reason to accept this. The stem árṇa- exists; the stem *arṇapá- (/-pā́-) does not. More importantly, Vṛtra is known for confining the waters, not drinking them. As was just noted, √śi ‘lie’ is a defining verb for Vṛtra in both I.32 and this hymn. In the former he lies there as the released waters stream over him (I.32.8ab … amuyā́śáyānam, … áti yanty ā́paḥ; cf. also 8d, 10). Here, in complementary fashion, he is depicted as lying over them before his defeat.

Although most take atrá- as a PN, I still prefer the older derivation (see, e.g., Gr) from √ad ‘eat’ with simplification of the geminate (*at-trá-), pace EWA s.v. átri-. It does not have to have anything to do with the seer Atri (átri-), but átrin- ‘voracious’ is, in my opinion, derivationally connected.
