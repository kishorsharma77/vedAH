See comm. above on the identical vs., V.57.8. Although it is a repeated vs., it fits nicely into this hymn: 1) ámṛtā ṛ́tajñāḥ has ring-compositional relationship with 1d amṛ́tasya svarā́jaḥ; note the twisted phonetic relationship between svarā́jaḥ and ṛ́tajñāḥ. 2) Pāda c: the accented voc. kávayo yúvānaḥ repairs the unaccented identical phrase in 3d. Perhaps this internal quotation is responsible for the metrical problem, 10 syls. with rest after caesura.
