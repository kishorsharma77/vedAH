In vs. 5 during his journey Soma “made it all Ārya”; here he crosses these Ārya domains (dhā́māny ā́ryā) on his journey to the cows’ milk. My interpr. takes this first acc. phrase as an acc. of extent, of space traversed, while the acc. in pāda c, vā́jaṃ gómantam I take as the goal of akṣaran. In the next vs., 15c, pavítram áti “across the filter” has the same function I see for dhā́māny ā́ryā here, and in fact the filter may be identified as the Ārya domains. By contrast Ge takes dhā́māny ā́ryā as parallel goal to vā́jaṃ gómantam, while Re characteristically supplies a separate participle (āviśántaḥ “ont occupé”) to govern dhā́māny ā́ryā. The parallels he cites in the n. do not seem sufficient to me.
