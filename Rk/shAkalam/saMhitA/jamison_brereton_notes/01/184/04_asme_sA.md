Unaccented mādhvī is of course a dual voc. addressed to the Aśvins, but given its proximity to fem. nom. sg. rātíḥ ‘gift’, it seems possible that it was meant to evoke also an accented mā́dhvī modifying this word. (However, Re points out that the fem. of mádhu- is generally identical to the masc. in the RV.)
