The usual truncation of instr. pl. ūtíbhiḥ (appropriate to final position in Jagatī and in dimeter meters) to sg. ūtī́in final position of a Triṣṭubh pāda. Cf., e.g., nṛ́tamābhir ūtī́# in VI.19.10 versus, e.g., V.40.3 (etc.) citrā́bhir ūtíbhiḥ#. Our own hymn contains an ex. of the full instr. pl. phrase in 3c #citrā́bhiḥ … ūtíbhiḥ …#. I consider such truncations to be synchronically generated, providing no evidence for any deep historical practice.

The bahuvrīhi puruvā́ja- is a hapax and may be a play on the poetic lineage bharádvāja-, which name appears in 6c.
