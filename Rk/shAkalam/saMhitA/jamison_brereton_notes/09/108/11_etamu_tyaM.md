The accentuation of dívaḥ poses problems. Pace Ge (n. 11b), who considers dívaḥ a gen. sg. with unusual accent, I take it as acc. pl. (flg. Old, in turn fld. by Re and Lü 202). Given the correctly accented gen./abl. sg. diváḥ in the immediately preceding vs. (10c), it is hard to believe that the poet would get the accent wrong, esp. in this exceptionally common form. As Old suggests, √duh takes a double acc. here. On dívaḥ as acc. pl., see also AiG III.226-27.
