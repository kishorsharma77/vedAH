The metaphorical universe of the soma hymns makes it difficult to interpr. the phrase ghṛtám páyaḥ, lit. “ghee (and) milk.” In the publ. tr. I take the phrase as the ultimate goal of pári srava, referring to the milk with which the soma will be mixed after its trip across the filter. See the esp. explicit IX.31.5 túbhyaṃ gā́vo ghṛtám páyah … dudhré “For you the cows have milked out ghee and milk,” which identifies the phrase as referring to substance(s) that the cows produce for soma, real dairy products. But soma is also sometimes compared to milk and to ghee (e.g., IX.74.4), and so the phrase can also be an appositive metaphorically characterizing the subject soma, accounting for Ge’s “Laufe du … als Schmalz und Milch.” However, our 5c svádanti gā́vo páyobhiḥ “the cows sweeten (soma) with their milk” suggests that the milk and ghee in this vs. are likewise firmly bovine
