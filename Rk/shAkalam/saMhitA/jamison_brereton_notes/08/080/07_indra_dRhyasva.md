A clever image that modulates from b to c. In b a lucky female is going to an assignation with Indra, playing on Indra’s known character as a hyper-virile pursuer of women. But in c this female is identified as a dhī́- a visionary thought (embodied as a poem), a word that is of course feminine. The adj. ṛtvíyāvatī is suitable for both the woman in b (‘conforming to her menstrual cycle’) and the poem in c (‘comforming to the ritual sequence’). This adjective is also found at VIII.12.10 with the same double application (though with dhītí- rather than dhī́-).
