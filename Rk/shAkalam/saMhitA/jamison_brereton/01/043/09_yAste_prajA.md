The creatures [=gods] that belong to you, the immortal one—as their  head you seek them in the highest domain of truth [=heaven]
and in the navel (of the earth?) [=ritual ground], Soma. You will know  them as the ones who attend upon (you), Soma.
The next group of hymns (I.44–50), attributed to Praskaṇva Kāṇva, the poet also of  VIII.49 (the first Vālakhilya hymn) and IX.95, has the defining feature that all the  hymns are related to a particular ritual litany, the Prātaranuvāka or “Early-Morning  Recitation” (on which see Eggeling Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa 2: 229 n. 2; Hillebrandt  1897: 128; Keith 1925 I: 328). The gods to whom these Praskaṇva hymns are dedi
cated are those mentioned in the litany: Agni, particularly in his capacity as illumi nator of the early morning and conveyor of the dawn divinities, the Aśvins, Dawn,  and the rising Sun.
