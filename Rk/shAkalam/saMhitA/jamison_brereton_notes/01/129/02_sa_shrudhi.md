The exact semantic relationship between the noun dákṣa- ‘skill’ and the related (pseudo-)gerundive dakṣā̀yya- is unclear and may be somewhat fluid. Here ‘besought, approached for skill’ seems to fit the context better than ‘to be skillfully served’ vel sim. (e.g., Re’s “(apte) à être servi-efficacement”). See disc. I.91.3.

The cmpd bhára-hūti-, here tr. as ‘battle cry’, actually contains part of the quoted cry as its first member: “the cry ‘carry (the day)’.” That is, I interpr. bháraas derived from the impv. bhára with omitted object. For the analytic version of this expression see V.29.8 … víśve ahvanta devā́, bháram índrāya yád áhiṃ jaghā́na “all the gods called “bhara” to Indra when he smashed the serpent.” Pādas de show nicely balanced alliteration, śūraiḥ s ú vaḥ sanitā ... viprair vā́jam, with responsion between yáḥ / yó, -aiḥ /-air, and the final -itā / -utā.

The verb iradhanta and nearby inf. irádhyai (I.134.2) are the only two forms showing the formant iradh. I connect them with √ṛdh (/rādh) ‘succeed, bring to success’, though the morphological details escape me.

In g the simile marker ná is superficially positioned as in 1g, after the first two words of the pāda, but in this case the placement is correct, since the simile only begins with the second word, átyam.
