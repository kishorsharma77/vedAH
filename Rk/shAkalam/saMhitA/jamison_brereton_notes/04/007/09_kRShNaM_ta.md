My interpr. of this vs. differs from the standard ones in several ways. First, in b most tr. take vápuṣām íd ékam as a nominal sentence: “(this is) one of the wonders.” In contrast, I take b as describing the moment of the birth of the ritual fire: a single physical flame rising from the wood, though it is well known that Agni has many forms (vápūṃṣi e.g., III.1.8, 18.5, 55.9). Thus, ékam modifies arcíḥ, and the pāda is a single clause.

Pādas bc then sketch a double paradox: the beam of the just-born Agni is single, though he has many forms and though a number of mothers conceive him as an embryo (dádhate ha gárbham). Pāda c also contains another paradox: his mothers conceive him though they are unimpregnated (ápravītā[ḥ]). My interpr. depends on reading pl. ápravītāḥ contra the Pp, which has singular -ā -- followed by Gr. and by all the standard tr., which also then must take dádhate as a thematic 3rd sg. (or perhaps a short-vowel subjunctive). With Old (Noten), I take dádhate as the expected indic. 3rd plural mid. to the redupl. pres. to √dhā and ápravītā as representing ápravītāḥ in sandhi. The same form, in the pl., is found in the very similar passage III.55.5 antárvatīḥ suvate ápravītā(ḥ), which also describes Agni’s “virgin birth”: “Having (him) within, (though) unimpregnated they give birth to (him).” Agni’s multiple mothers also figure earlier in our own hymn, 6a.

The publ. tr. takes pāda d as a subordinate clause, still under the control of yád beginning pāda c, primarily because of the accent on bhávasi. However, it is quite possible that d is a separate main clause (“immediately at birth, you become a messenger”) with the verbal accent owing to the immediately following íd. Many of the exx. given by Gr (no. 5, s.v. íd) of accented verbs followed by íd are pāda-initial and therefore non-probative (since they would be accented anyway), but there is a sturdy residue of non-initial apparent main clause verbs with accent.
