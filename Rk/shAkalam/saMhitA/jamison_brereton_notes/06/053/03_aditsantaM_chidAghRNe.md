For some reason Ge always refuses to tr. the standing epithet of Pūṣan, ā́ghṛṇi-, though he fearlessly takes on far more challenging lexical items. The word must belong to the inherited root √ghṛ ‘be hot, burn’, etc., found only in nominal forms in Skt.; see EWA s.vv. ghṛṇá-, gharmá-. Why Pūṣan is glowing, fiery, I don’t know; perhaps it would be best to adopt Re’s ‘ardent’.

ví mrada is the only verbal form to this root in the RV, and such forms are quite rare in Vedic (ví mradate MS, mradaya- TS). (For detailed disc. see Gotō 247- 48.) The root is otherwise found in the RV only in the cmpd. ū́rṇa-mradas- ‘soft as wool, lit. having the softness of wool’ in the funeral hymn X.18.10. I wonder if mrad belongs to the technical terminology of fabric construction and therefore would fit in with Pūṣan’s connection to homely, practical activities, as in the words for ‘awl’ (or whatever ā́rā- is) and the like in this hymn. However, the TS, MS passages don’t support this speculation.
