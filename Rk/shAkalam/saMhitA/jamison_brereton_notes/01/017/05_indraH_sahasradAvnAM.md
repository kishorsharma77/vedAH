As noted in the intro., this is the middle verse of the hymn and the only one in which Indra and Varuṇa are separated, and in my view translations that don’t take this into account are likely to be on the wrong track. (So, Ge’s “Indra, Varuṇa sind der preisliche Rat der rühmlichen Tausendschenker,” which puts all nominatives and all genitives together.) The rhetorical structure of ab, nom. sg. - gen. pl. / nom. sg. - gen. pl., invites an association of each nom. sg. with its immediately following gen. pl., producing a contrastive pair of Indra associated with thousand-giving and Varuṇa with (something) to be proclaimed. I have followed this rhetoric clue and, further, have tentatively supplied a noun (‘master’) to head the gen. phrase. Alternatively, krátuḥ of c may be the head (“Indra becomes the krátu of …”), as WG take it (also Ge). There is the further question of what śaṃsyā̀nām refers to. I have somewhat reluctantly supplied ‘riches’, since this is a theme of the hymn and śaṃsyà- several times modifies rayí- and similar words (e.g., VIII.60.11, X.47.2). However, it also regularly qualifies verbal products like ukthyà- or ukthá-, and given Varuṇa’s nature, an association with “(solemn words) to be proclaimed” is probably more likely than with “(riches) to be proclaimed.” I might therefore modify my published translation, though the desire for wealth is quite strong in this hymn (see vss. 3-4, 6-7).
