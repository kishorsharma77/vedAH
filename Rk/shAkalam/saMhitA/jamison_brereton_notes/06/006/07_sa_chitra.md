The insistent etymological alliteration in this vs. seems to me inartful overkill, though it certainly provides an explosive climax. The forms of √cit in the first hemistich — citra citráṃ citáyantam …, cítrakṣatra citrátamam — give way to √cand in a slightly more restrained array, candrám … cándra candrā́bhiḥ. Since both roots belong to the same semantic sphere and begin with c, the difference in effect between the hemistichs is minimal.

It is not clear what should be supplied with the fem. instr. pl. candrā́bhiḥ. The standard tr. use ‘flames’, and I’ve followed suit, but śúci-, which figured in vss. 3-4, is unfortunately masc. when used as a noun. Re suggests alternatively stutíbhiḥ ‘praises’ (fld. by Mau), pointing to the adjacent gṛṇaté ‘singer’, but it is more natural to take the instr. candrā́bhiḥ with Agni syntactically, rather than construing it with the dat. participle, and further, candrá- seems never to be used with verbal products.
