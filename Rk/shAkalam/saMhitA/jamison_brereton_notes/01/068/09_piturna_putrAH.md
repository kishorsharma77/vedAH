This verse returns us to vs. 3; the b-pādas of both are identical: krátuṃ juṣanta “They take pleasure in your/his resolve.” In vs. 3 the subject is “all”; here we can assume that the unidentified subject here is “all” as well, and, since vs. 8 follows easily on vs. 7, we can superimpose “all” as subject there too. In vs. 3 the “all” found this pleasure when Agni was born in cd; the parallelism between vs. 3 and vss. 8-9 supports my view that vs. 8 also concerns the kindling of the fire, and the birth metaphor of 3cd (jániṣṭḥāḥ ‘you are born’) further supports my suggestion that the rétaḥ ‘seed’ of 8a refers to the means of begetting the fire.
