The issue in this vs. is the identify of the two dhā́manī; dependent on the answer to that is the function of the du. pronoun tā́bhyām, which could be instr., dat., or abl.

Answering the first question is made difficult by the fact that this is the only du. form of dhā́man- in the RV. Ge tr. “Formen” (likewise Re “formes”) and in n. 2-3 explains these as the different stages (Stadien) the soma goes through in its preparation. This interpr. fails to explain the difference between the du. of vs. 2 and the pl. of 3; nor does it account for how Soma “rules with” these forms (taking tā́bhyām as instr. as he does). Re’s interpr. of dhā́manī in 2 as the pure and mixed forms of soma provides a satisfactory account of the dual, but does not explain the transition to the pl. in 3 and again fails to explain how Soma rules with them. I take the term quite differently, as ‘domains’ (rather than ‘forms’). In vs. 2 the dual refers to Heaven and Earth and alludes to the split of Soma into heavenly and earthly forms, a common trope in IX: he has a home in both places. Taking tā́bhyām as abl., I see Soma as ruling from both those polarized spaces, which together contain everything.

This interpr. gives pratīcī́in c more content than the fairly empty renderings of Ge (“die sich (uns) darbieten”) and Re (“qui se tiennent face (à nous)”): Heaven and Earth as the two cosmic halves face each other.
