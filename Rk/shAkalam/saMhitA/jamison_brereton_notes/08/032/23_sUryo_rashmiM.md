Pāda a plays on the ambiguity of raśmí-, both ‘ray’ and ‘rein’.

Although the simile in c seems to match the frame in b in case (nom. gíraḥ / ā́paḥ, acc. tvā / nimnám), there is a functional mismatch: the waters are not guiding the deep as the songs are guiding Indra. It therefore seems best to take ā́paḥ as one of the occasional examples of nom. for acc. in this stem, corresponding to tvā in the frame, with nimnám a further specification of goal. Ge clearly recognizes the problem and supplies a verb for the simile in c, “wie die Gewässer … (fliessen),” but this violates the structure of the RVic simile, which always holds the verb in common with the frame.
