The 2nd hemistich is universally tr. (save for Scar, 656) as a single rel. clause, but amināt is unaccented and so d must be a separate clause.

In c the standard tr. (incl. also Scar) construe the instr. pl. śūṣaíḥ with instr. pl.

sátvabhiḥ (e.g., Ge “mit seinen mutigen Streitern”). This of course would be the default assumption. However, in almost every occurrence of the stem śūṣá-, including all the other examples of the instr. pl., it refers to hymns or praises, whether with a limiting noun or not. I therefore separate it from the other instr. in the pāda and take it as having its usual referent. The poet claims that Indra’s strength is at least partially dependent on our strengthening praises.
