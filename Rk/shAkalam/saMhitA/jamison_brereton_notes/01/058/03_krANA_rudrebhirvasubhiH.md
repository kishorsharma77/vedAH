On krāṇā́‘successfully’, derived from the old fem. instr. sg. of the med. root aor. participle of √kṛ in adv. usage, see Old (Fs. Kern [1903] 33-36 = KlSch 1111- 14 [details in EWA s.v. kṛāṇā́]).

Since ví / ápa + ṛṇóti/ṛṇváti regularly refers to the unclosing of doors and the like (e.g., I.128.6 dvā́rā vy ṛ̀ṇvati; IX.102.8 ṛṇór ápa vrajám), the tr. ‘distribute’ (Ge ‘teilt … aus’, WG ‘verteilt’, Re ‘répartit’) seriously manipulates the idiom. I therefore prefer ‘disclose’ - that is, unclose and reveal to sight. (So also Old SBE.) In this usage the stem has clearly assimilated itself to ūrṇoti (√vṛ) + ápa / ví ‘open’, and one wonders if they were felt to belong to different roots by the poets. For further on this stem see Kü 104-5.
