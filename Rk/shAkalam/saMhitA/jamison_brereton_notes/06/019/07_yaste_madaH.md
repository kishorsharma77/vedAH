On the long root vowel in jigīvā́ṃsaḥ, see Old ZDMG 55.324, where on the basis of the metrical evidence he surmises that, at least in this post-caesura position, the form should be read with short root vowel (*jigi-vaṃs-), the form found in the younger Vedic texts. See also Arnold (Ved. Met. 143), who considers the short-i form required in 3 of the 5 occurrences of the strong stem, and Kü (189 n. 225), who considers it proper except in III.15.4. Kü cites Anttila (1969, Schwebeabl. 61) as explaining the lengthening in the Saṃhitā text as analogy to ninīvā́ṃs-. However, it is much more likely that it is a morphologically conditioned lengthening, meant to distinguish the -i-vowel proper to the root from the -i-liaison vowel that has become associated with suffixes/endings. Thus jigī-vā́ṃs- with long vowel is kept separate from the type tasth-ivā́ṃs-, as I already argued in my 1988 article on the vocalized laryngeal (224-25), though without factoring in the metrical evidence pointing to this lengthening as late and redactional. (Of course, in tasthivā́ṃs- the -i- would originally have represented the zero-grade of this -ā root, but by synchronic RV it has been reanalyzed as part of the suffix. See disc. in my 1988 art.)
