The story of Bhujyu, son of Tugra, is treated in I.116.3-5, also a Kakṣīvant composition. (See also Agastya’s mention of it in nearby I.180.5.) Bhujyu was abandoned by his father in the middle of the trackless sea; the Aśvins make a boat for him and bring him home. Just as here, the boat(s) is(/are) described in I.116.3 as ātmanvánt- and in I.116.4 as having wings. The former is generally tr. as ‘breathing’ (atmend, WG) or ‘possessing a soul’ (beseelt, Gr, Ge). I wonder rather if the ‘body, trunk’ sense of ātmán- is at issue here, and it refers to a boat with a cockpit or hollowed-out well for sitting, rather than a flat raft. The “paunchy” (if that’s what it means and if it refers to the boats) in 6c would support this interpr. The wings would then be sails. (The latter is an easy transfer; e.g., in English sailing downwind with the mainsail on one side and the jib on the other is referred to as “wing and wing.”) Of course, I am not denying that the Aśvin-made vessel did actually fly (see pāda d), but I do suggest that there’s a germ of realia in the description -- and that a boat with a body makes more sense than a boat with a soul.

With most interpr. I take supaptanī́as an instr. sg. to a fem. nomen act.; see Old’s exx. of similar phrases with a verb and su-compounded cognate instr. It is perhaps worthy of note that the new-style weak pf. pet- coexists here with the old style redupl. -papt-.
