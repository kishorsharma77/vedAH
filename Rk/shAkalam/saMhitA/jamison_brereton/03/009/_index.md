Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
9 verses: triṣṭubh
The setting of the poem is the kindling of Agni in the very early morning (cf. vs. 7).  Thematically, the poet parallels the gods’ search for Agni and the human priests’  kindling of fire. The fire has disappeared into the waters or into the wood, which  has absorbed the waters. Therefore, it is in the waters that the “watchful and unde
ceiving ones,” either priests or gods, have found him. The double reference is par ticularly well expressed in verse 5. The first part of the verse alludes to the myth  of Agni’s flight from the gods and to the myth of Mātariśvan, who brings the fire  from heaven. But the final phrase devébhyo mathitám pári, here translated “stolen  from among the gods,” could also mean “churned from among the gods.” That is,  it likely refers to the priestly act of creating fire by friction as well as to the story of  Mātariśvan’s bringing fire.
