In addition to the voc. vāstoṣ pate that repeats the three vs.-initial vocc.

vā́stoṣ pate in VII.54, this vs. has other similarities to VII.54, esp. VII.54.1: amīvahā́ ‘destroying affliction’ echoes 54.1 anamīváḥ ‘without affliction’, as āviśán ‘entering’ does 54.1 svāveśáḥ ‘easy to enter’; sim. sákhā ‘companion’ and 54.2 sakhyé ‘companionship’. Note also that pāda c sákhā suśéva edhi naḥ is identical to I.91.15; I.91 is the Soma hymn that VII.54.2ab seems to have been partially based on. In addition, pāda b is identical to VIII.15.13b and IX.25.4a, both of which are addressed to Soma (on Soma as the addressee in the former, see comm. ad loc.). I do not quite understand the Soma/Vāstoṣpati connection.
