vidátha- is here not ‘ceremony of division, rite’, but rather ‘division’ itself, referring to the divisions of the gods. Ge aptly adduces VI.52.15 in the next hymn, where the gods are born in 3 different localities.

Old strenuously objects to taking sanutár ā́ca as a conjoined phrase of directional elements (flg. BR), and Re agrees with him. I do not see the problem; ā́is of course generally a preverb and less commonly an adposition, but in these usages it is clearly directional/locational, and conjoining it with another such element seems well within RVic syntactic bounds, even if the other word is more clearly adverbial.

Moreover, neither Old nor Re gives any indication of what to do with ca if it’s not conjoining the two. I therefore follow Ge (flg. BR) and Klein (DGRV I.63). (The case of Re is a bit complex: he expresses his objections to the BR view in the notes to the Viśvedevāḥ hymns in EVP IV, but in the tr. of those same hymns in EVP V he tr.

as a conjoined phrase “au loin et au près.” Either he forgot or he changed his mind.)
