Indra  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
King Sudās, the leader in the Battle of the Ten Kings (VII.18), appears here in verse  3, and the context is once again that of war and hostility. In sometimes vivid lan guage we beg Indra to support our side in the conflict and to destroy our enemies.
