Praskaṇva Kāṇva
14 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
As indicated in the introduction to the Praskaṇva collection, this hymn to Agni  praises him in his connection to the rituals of the early morning, especially in his  role as conveyor of the other gods who attend this sacrifice. In its fourteen verses  this hymn seldom departs from this simple message. The language is measured and  dignified, but not difficult or poetically contorted.
