The hemistich-internal enjambment in ab -- … vṛ́ṣā te, sutáḥ sómaḥ … -- is noteworthy, esp. because b is a repeated pāda (VII.24.2b), and in its other occurrence the pāda is syntactically self-contained. In fact, WG tr. the two pādas separately here, with vṛ́ṣā in pāda a referring to Indra and te a gen. with rátham: “Auf deinen stierhaften Streitwagen steige als Stierhafter.” This isn’t impossible, but the other interpr. (fld. by Ge and Re) seems more natural.
