The word order of c is slightly skewed. All things being equal, forms of the sá/tám pronoun, esp. in correlative usage, tend to take 1st position in the pāda/clause. This expectation is reinforced here by 2nd position íd ‘just, only’, which really should limit tám (as my tr. reflects), but the verb pā́t seems to have displaced the pronoun to the right of íd.
