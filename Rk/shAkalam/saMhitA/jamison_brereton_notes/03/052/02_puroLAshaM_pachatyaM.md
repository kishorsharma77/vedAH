The verb in pāda b, yakṣi, is simply an injunctive 1st sg. s-aor. to √yaj, but it is rendered as a future/modal in all the standard tr. (including this one). This value seems also found in the identical form in X.52.5, though not in X.4.1. (Gr’s ex. in VI.16.8 is better taken as a 2nd-sg. act. -si impv.) I don’t know why this particular form should have this value, save for the general functional flexibility of the injunctive. But perhaps the fact that the formally identical 2nd sg. act. -si impv. is so common and (as an old s-aor. subjunctive) is used in both imperatival and subjunctive-future value may have allowed that value to spill over onto its formal twin.
