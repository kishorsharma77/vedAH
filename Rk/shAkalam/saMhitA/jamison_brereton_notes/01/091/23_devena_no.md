In the phrase devéna … mánasā we again confront a noun (devá-) that seems to be used adjectivally (see vs. 14 above). I have half given in to this temptation, with “god(like).” The verb ā́tanat in c poses some difficulties in interpretation. Surprisingly, none of the standard tr. who discuss the phrase notes that the same lexeme (ā́√tan) appears in the previous verse (22c) in the same metrical position and in a common, almost clichéd́ usage. I think that ā́tanat here is a slangy expression, deliberately constrasting with the high-style cosmic-description usage of ā́tatantha in 22. I take the subject to be the wealth (or share of wealth) of b, rather than the mánas- of a, as Ge (/WG) take it, nor would I following Re in taking it as an impersonal construction.

It is not entirely clear who the “both” are in d: Ge singers and patrons, Re men and gods.

Ge supplies ‘path’ with prá cikitsā (“sei … der Pfadfinder”) on the basis of IV.47.20. This is possible, and might even be supported by the panthā́m in vs. 1, since prá cikitsā seems to form a slight ring with prá cikitaḥ in 1a. However, the verb does not need an object, in my opinion; the desiderative here can express a general intention to be alertly perceptive.
