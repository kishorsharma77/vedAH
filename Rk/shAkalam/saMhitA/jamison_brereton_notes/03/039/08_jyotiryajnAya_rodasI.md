Pāda b seems to pose an almost deliberate syntactic challenge. The adverbial āré ‘at a distance’ is normally construed with an ablative, as in 7b āré syāma duritā́t, but in 8b we have the same phrase but with the noun in the genitive: āré syāma duritásya bhū́reḥ. Or so it is taken by everyone, including me. But I now wonder if the ambiguous form bhū́reḥ, which could be genitive or ablative, is in fact the latter and is not modifying duritásya but rather governing it: “May we be at a distance from an abundance of difficulty.”
