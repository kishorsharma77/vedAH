Ge thinks that this verse is addressed to the other singers, but this requires that the voc. vrktabarhi ̥ ṣaḥ in 20 and 21 have two different referents (so explicitly Ge’s n. 3), which seems unlikely. I take the Maruts to be the addressees, as in vs. 20, and follow Macdonell (Hymns from the Rigveda, p. 60) as well as Lüders (Var. 426- 27) in taking the verse as contrasting the Maruts’ former friendly behavior to the poet and his fellow ritualists with their neglect now -- a neglect drawn attention to by the questions in the immediately preceding vs. 20. Acdg. to Delbrück (AiS 502), ha sma purā́+ PRESENT expresses what was accustomed to happen in the past. I also take stómebhiḥ not as the Maruts’ praise songs, but rather the ones produced by us, as an instrumental of price. Macdonell’s tr. “as once ye did for praise…” seems to reflect a similar interpr.
