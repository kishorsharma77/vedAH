Pūsaṇ
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
4 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 2
This last hymn in the Pūṣan cycle in Maṇḍala VI is the only one in trimeter meter,  rather than the less formal dimeter. It pictures Pūṣan in a more cosmic context than  the previous hymns and ascribes rather more powers to him. The final verse (4),  probably with verse 3, refers to the apparent marriage of Pūṣan to Sūryā, daughter  of the Sun, a tale alluded to in passing earlier in this cycle.854 VI.59
## 1
The one of yours is gleaming, the other of yours belongs to the
sacrifice: the two day(-halves [=night and day]) of dissimilar form.
You are like heaven,
for you give aid to all magical powers, o autonomous one. Let your
giving be propitious here, Pūṣan.
## 2
Having goats as his horses, protecting livestock, granting a house full of  prizes, quickening poetic vision, fitted into all creation,
Pūṣan the god, always brandishing his pliant goad, goes speeding, as he  surveys the creatures.
## 3
The ships of yours that are in the sea, the golden ones that wander in the  midspace,
with these you travel on a mission of the Sun, o you prompted by desire,  as you seek fame.
## 4
Pūṣan has good lineage from Heaven and from Earth, lord of
refreshment, bounteous, of wondrous luster,
whom the gods gave to Sūryā, him prompted by desire, powerful, of  lovely outlook.
