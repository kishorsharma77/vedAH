Although this vs. is quite straightforward in general, it has some peculiarities. To begin with, the four nominal clauses with ayám in the first hemistich are all in the unusual order X ayám, which is reversed (/repaired) in the four subsequent vss. See esp. the opening of 1a svādúṣ kílāyám corrected to the more standard 2a ayáṃ svādúḥ. I have no idea what motivated the X ayám order.

It is not clear to me whether the four clauses name four different types/preparations of soma or all four refer to a single soma (or, in some way, both: all soma drinks, no matter how prepared, are in essence one).

Note also the particle kíla, which is rare in the RV, esp. outside of X: only 5 of the 12 occurrences are not in X, and 2 of them are in this vs. I am also puzzled by the accent on asyá in c. Since the soma is amply referred to earlier in the vs., we would expect unaccented asya (cf., e.g., papivām̐índro asya V.29.3, 30.11). I have no explanation, and it seems not to have bothered any other commentator.
