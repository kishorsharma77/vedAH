Indra (1–3), the Aśvins (4–6)  
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra  
6 verses: āstārapaṅkti 1–3, anuṣṭubh 4–6  
Two separate short hymns, distinguished by divinity, meter, contents, and style. The  first three verses, to Indra, contain the Vimada refrain. (For a discussion of its  structure see the introduction to X.21.) The poet straightforwardly asks for goods  and aid from the god in return for the soma offered to him.  
The second three verses, to the Aśvins, allude to an otherwise unknown or  little-known myth in which these gods churn out a pair of females (which may or  may not be magical fire-churning sticks), which fly away to the gods’ disappoint ment; the gods ask the Aśvins to return them (vss. 4–5). If we knew the myth, it  would no doubt be fascinating, but in the absence of further textual evidence, it  must remain a tantalizing fragment.
