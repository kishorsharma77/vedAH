Improper relative, as shown best by Re’s rendering, “Les corps-de-louange qui, poussée, (vont toujours) plus haut…” (Re’s suspension dots). The masc. nom. pl. yé … stómāḥ of ab has no matching grammatical referent in the main clause of c, though it is picked up by its semantic and etymological equivalent, fem. sg. suṣṭutí-.
