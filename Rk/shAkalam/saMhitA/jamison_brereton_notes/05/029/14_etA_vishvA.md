This vs. is structured somewhat like vs. 13, with (a) etā́víśvā cakṛvā́n corresponding to (13b) (vīryā̀) … yā́cakártha, though with pf. participle not rel. cl., and (c) yā́cid nú … kṛṇávaḥ corresponding even more closely to (13c) yā́co nú … kṛṇávaḥ. I would therefore now slightly emend the publ. tr. to reflect this parallelism more closely: “By your nature you cannot be circumscribed in heroism -- you, Indra, (as one) having done all these many (deeds) (as well as) those (deeds) that you will do even now in your daring. There exists no one to obstruct this power of yours.” In other words I take pādas a and c as parallel adjunct expressions, with b as their joint main clause, and d (like 13d) independent. Note that d has no overt referent for yā́in c. The English is awkward, but this structure corresponds better to the Skt.
