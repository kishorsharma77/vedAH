The publ. tr. contains a grammatical error. It takes priyā́as modifying fem.

pl. tanvàḥ, but the sandhi context of priyā́makes this impossible: it would have to be

*priyā́ḥ. It must modify śárma (as Ge takes it, also Gr), which must then be a neut.

plural to the -an-stem. This tr. should be corrected to “… stretch wide their own bodies as dear shelters …” Ge takes tanvàḥ and śárma as implicitly conjoined (“Wo die Tapferen ihre Leiber breit machen (and) die lieben Schilde des Vaters”), but I think it more likely that the champions are stretching their bodes to serve as shelters/shields. Under this interpr. the plural of śárma makes sense: multiple bodies multiple shields.

Pādas abc strongly echo 9abc, with the c pādas esp. close, both containing the VP chardír yacha (in opposite order and non-contiguous in 12c) + conjoined DAT. beneficiary (9c maghávadbhyaś ca máhyaṃ ca; 12c tanvè táne ca). However, the first hemistich of 12 varies tellingly from 9ab: in 9 it is Indra who holds out the shelter (śaraṇám), which is equated with the chardíḥ of c, but in 12 it is the mortal champions (śū́rāsaḥ) who offer their own bodies as shelter (śárma). (Although the two words for ‘shelter’ are different, they are transparently related and share the same descriptors elsewhere.) The bodies of the mortal warriors are theirs to deploy, but also under the protection of Indra, as shown not only by tanvè in the next pāda as recipient of Indra’s protection, but also by tanūpā́ḥ ‘protector of bodies’ in 10d, applied to Indra.

The last pādas of vss. 9 and 12 provide the final thread of connection between the two vss., since both contain the impv. yāváyā̆ ‘keep away’. In 12d the accent on the verb is anomalous, but I have no trouble assuming that it was adapted from 9d, where the initial position of the verb requires it.
