The identity of the addressee in this verse is not overt. As Ge points out, Sāy suggests that the singer is addressing himself, though pādas ab make difficulties for that interpretation. Old argues for Soma, which seems likely even though, unusually for an Indra hymn, soma has not previously figured in this hymn. However, all three pādas have parallels in the soma maṇḍala: for pāda a see IX.109.3c mahé kṣáyāya; pāda b is repeated in IX.25.4a modifying soma; and IX.111.3e is identical to the first three words in pāda c, save for the grammatical identity of the verb form (3rd pl. injunctive in IX.111.3, 2nd sg. imperative here). That Soma is the addressee here and so the subject of the impv. harṣayā is also supported by vs. 4 in the next hymn (VIII.16), where the exhilarating drinks (of soma) are called harṣumánt-.

Again, as in vs. 9, Ge waters down the meaning of kṣáya- to fit the context (“dweller,” not “dwelling”), but in his n. suggests that the dwelling, namely heaven, stands as a metonym for its inhabitants, the gods. I prefer not to recast and paraphrase the literal sense as Ge does, especially since, as it stands, this half-verse expresses a small but neat paradox involving container/contained: Soma both enters everything (b) and provides a vessel in which everything (or "we" anyway) can dwell (a).

In c jaítrāya picks up jaítrā in 3c.
