Āprı̄
Vasuśruta Ātreya
11 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn follows the usual sequence of the Āprī litany, although it omits the normal  explicit reference to the barhis, the ritual grass, in verse 4. Until the very end of the  hymn, the poet uses the imperative except in verse 2, which has the subjunctive, and  in verse 6, in which he announces that he is beseeching Evening and Dawn but does  not directly state what he wishes to occur. However, he implies a request for strength  by calling the two deities vayovŕ̥dh “increasing vigor.” The last verse, however, shows  a decided shift that is signaled by the complete absence of a verb. Through the repeti tion of the ritual call svā́hā, the verse marks the moment at which the priest makes  the offering that should culminate or accomplish all the things urged before.
