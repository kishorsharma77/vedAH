The voc. siṣṇo is a hapax. Flg. Gr (hesitatingly endorsed by EWA, s.v.), I take it as a nonce u-adj. to a reduplicated form of √sani ‘gain, win’. Although an analysis as a desiderative u-adjecive is morphologically impossible (there being no trace of a desid. suffix), I still wonder if that is the semantic nuance here -- as if it were an aniṭ variant of siṣāsú-. Ge tentatively follows Ludwig’s connection with √sā/si ‘bind’ (“du Fänger”); Re tr. it as a PN and considers it an imitation of viṣṇo. It might also be a deformation of *śiśo, the expected but unattested voc. to śíśu- ‘child’, a frequent epithet of Agni. The context does not strongly favor (or disfavor) any of these hypotheses, and none of them is particularly strong.

ā́dade is variously interpreted; even its root affiliation is disputed: to √dā ‘give’ (which with ā́in the middle means ‘take’) or √dā ‘bind’. I take it to the former and assume an idiomatic meaning ‘take’ of a fire just “catching hold,” starting to burn -- an idiom also present in English (at least my English). If it also has its standard meaning ‘take [goods, etc.]’, the kindled and spreading fire could be “taking” everything in its path, and the ‘desire to gain’ sense I imputed to siṣṇo might be weakly supported.

Gr, Ge, and Re take kṣapáḥ as gen. sg. dependent on vástuṣu (Ge: “beim Hellwerden der Nacht”), though Re raises, and rejects, the possibility that it is acc. pl.

-- the analysis I favor. The acc. pl. of kṣáp- is found elsewhere in extent-of-time
usage. Case disharmony (here between acc. and loc. pl.) is esp. common in temporal expressions, and, as we’ve seen, there are a number of other disharmonious phrases in this hymn.
