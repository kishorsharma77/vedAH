Indra and Agni  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first six verses of this hymn, though they contain numerous examples of dual  address of and reference to Indra and Agni together, are strongly skewed toward  Indra. The two gods are called “smiters of Vr̥tra” (vss. 1, 4) and “possessors of  good maces” (Indra’s weapon; vs. 4); they “smite” (Indra’s activity) the enemy (vs.  5) and “drive” to the sacrifice (vs. 6; since Agni is kindled on the ritual ground, he  has no need to drive to it). Moreover the theme is the winning of prizes (vā́ja) and  their distribution, and the besting of opponents: this agonistic cast is more typical  of Indra than of Agni. The last two verses (7–8) are addressed to Agni only, in his  familiar ritual role, mediating between the sacrificer and the gods, including Indra.  But even in these verses Agni’s own character is overlaid with that of other gods: for  instance, in verse 7 he seems to be assimilated to Varuṇa and the other Ādityas in  forgiving offenses.
