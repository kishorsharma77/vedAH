Although sg. fem. urūcī́is not otherwise used of the earth in its 5 other occurrences, the du. modifies ródasī in VI.11.4 (and at some distance in IV.56.4), which supports Ge’s supplying of Earth here. 49 The well-attested adj. suháva- almost always modifies a god or gods and means ‘easy to invoke’. Ge supplies ‘names’ here, and I follow him: “god X, easy to invoke” and “the name of god X, easy to invoke” are functionally nearly identical.

And in X.39.1 pitúr ná nā́ma suhávam “(the chariot), easy to invoke like the name of one’s father,” we have the posited phrase, though “name” is in a simile. Re rejects this interpr. in favor of a nominalized suháva- “les appels propices (faits) aux dieux,” with, in my opinion, insufficient reason.
