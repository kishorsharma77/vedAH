R̥bhus  
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5 and 9  
The R̥bhus are originally mortal craftsmen who achieved immortality because of a  series of marvelous deeds. This hymn begins in the ritual here-and-now, where the  R̥bhus, already immortal, are offered their share of the sacrifice by the poet-sacri ficer, who speaks in the 1st person. The story of their achievement is then begun  in verse 2, with the R̥bhus depicted as itinerant skilled workers, rather like the poet  and his comrades (thus perhaps holding out the hope that immortality will come  to them as well). The particular feats they accomplished are then recounted, with  special emphasis on their turning Tvaṣṭar’s single cup into four (vss. 3, 5), the oth ers hurriedly covered in verse 8, interspersed with pleas for their favor.
