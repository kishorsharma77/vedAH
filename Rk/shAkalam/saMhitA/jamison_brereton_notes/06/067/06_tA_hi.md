The vs. is knit together with phonological and etymological figures. Each pāda contains a form of div/dyu: a dyū́n, b dyoḥ, c -devo, d dyā́m. Note also the phonological similarity of the two du. verbs dhāráyethe (a), dṛṃhéthe (b), with the latter reprised etymologically by dṛḷhó in c. Pādas b and d also rhyme.

Unlike the standard tr. I take b as part of the hí cl. beginning in a, with cd as the main cl. Since the verb of b, dṛṃhéthe, is initial, it can owe its accent either to its position (as most interpr. it) or to belonging to a subord. cl., as I do. Nonetheless, there is little riding on this choice, though I would support mine by pointing out that the fact that M+V made the back of heaven firm (b) could serve as a reason why the sun is also firmly fixed (c).

Contra Klein (explicitly, DGRV I.379-80) and Ge/Re (implicitly), I do not think that utá, positioned in the middle of c, conjoins b and c, but instead begins a new cl., which continues through d.

With Ge (and, judging from his tr., Re), I divide dhāsínāyóḥ into dhāsínā ayóḥ, with the gen.-loc. du. of ayám, not āyóḥ, gen.-abl. sg. of āyú- with the Pp.
