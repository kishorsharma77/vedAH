By making pāda a a nominal sentence, from which the relative clause of bc hangs, I avoid the need to supply a main clause verb for c that other tr. encounter.

E.g., Ge “Die … Fahrrosse, die dich fahren, (mögen) die Götter … her(fahren).” However, in the following vs. (7) Agni himself is urged to bring the gods here, so lumping together the transport of Agni and the gods as in my interpretation of 6 may not be in the spirit of their separation in 7. Nonetheless, I still feel that the syntactic argument is strong.
