Because of the middle voice of the part., I interpr. návyam ā́yur dádhānā as referring to Dawn’s new life, which she would then assume every day. The middle voice contrasts with VII.77.5 pratirántī na ā́yuḥ “(she,) lengthening our lifetime.” Both Ge and Re seem to imply that in our passage the new life is established for others.

The sg. abodhi at the end of the first hemistich matches the pl. abudhran in the same position in vs. 1.

Pāda d prā́cikitat sū́ryaṃ yajñám agním is exactly parallel to VII.78.3 ájījanat sū́ryaṃ yajñám agním, which suggests that ácikitat is felt as a redupl. aor. to the caus.

cetáyati, despite the obvious drawbacks of form (we would expect *acīkitat).
