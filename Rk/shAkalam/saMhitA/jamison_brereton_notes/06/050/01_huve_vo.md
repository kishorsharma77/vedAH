The hymn begins with the 1st ps. mid. huvé ‘I invoke/call upon’, like the last hymn, which began (VI.49.1) stuṣé ‘I will praise’.

On the ill-assorted trio Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, see comm. ad VI.49.1. Here the phrase is in the acc., but likewise in a Triṣṭubh cadence. The expected Aryaman is added in the next pāda.
