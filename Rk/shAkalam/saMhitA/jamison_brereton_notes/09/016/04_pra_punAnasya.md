In the publ. tr. I construe punānásya with pavítre, not with adjacent cétasā, as Ge and Re do. I would now emend my tr. to the standard: “with the attention of the one being purified [that is, himself].” Ge comments (n. 4a), “Er weiss von selbst, was er zu tun hat,” and although I’m not entirely sure that this is what the phrase means, my publ. tr. doesn’t make much sense either and overlooks the fact that pāda b, which contains the noun, pavítre, on which I hang the gen. punānásya, is found identically in the next hymn (17.3), as well as in IX.37.1, both times without a gen.
