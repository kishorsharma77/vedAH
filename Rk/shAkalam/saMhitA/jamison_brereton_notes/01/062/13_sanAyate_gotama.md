sanāyánt- is likewise only here. Note its semantic opposite návyam at the end of the pāda, the same contrast as sanāyúvo … návyo in 11a.

Like the last verse of the preceding hymn (I.61.16), this verse is extra-hymnic in some ways, but also has connections with the rest of the hymn. The “old” pattern continues to open the verse, and the voc. śavasāna in c forms a ring with the same stem in the dative in 1a.
