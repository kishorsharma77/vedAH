ṛbhukṣā́in d may refer to the Maruts collectively, as I’ve taken it, or to Indra, already mentioned in ab. Re suggests both possibilities, though he goes for Indra in his tr. (as do Ge, WG). It is true that singular ṛbhukṣā́ḥ generally refers to Indra, while it is plural ṛbhukṣánaḥ that qualifies the Maruts (VIII.7.9, 12, etc.). As in 8d I’m taking interpreting the singular as collective referring to the Marut flock. If the referent is taken as Indra, the tr. should be altered to “the Ṛbhu-master of the superior men,” which seems a bit awkward.
