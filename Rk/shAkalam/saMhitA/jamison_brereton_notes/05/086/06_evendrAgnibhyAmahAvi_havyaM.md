havyá, so accented, is generally ‘oblation’, as opposed to hávya- ‘invocation’.

However, in this case it is difficult not to see a pun, with the hymn just completed counting both as an oblation (“like ghee …,” pāda c) and an invocation, accompanying the physical oblation. The pun is further enabled by the adj. śūṣyà- ‘forceful’, which in its other two occurrences (I.54.3, VII.66.1) modifies types of speech (vácas- and stóma- respectively).

This pun may help explain the curious expression “like ghee purified by stones” (ghṛtáṃ ná pūtám ádribhiḥ). The problem of course is that it is soma, not ghee, that is purified by stones. It is very doubtful that stones could play a role in preparing melted butter (pity the poor cow), and although the root √pū is occasionally used of ghṛtá- (e.g., VI.10.2 and esp. the very similar VIII.12.4 ghṛtáṃ ná pūtám adrivaḥ) -- and consider the English term for ghee, “clarified butter” -- it is overwhelming characteristic of soma. The standard tr. deal with the disharmony in this simile by separating it into two -- e.g., Ge “durch die Presssteine (gepresst), wie Schmalz geklärt.” By contrast, I think the ill-assorted technology in the simile was deliberately introduced, to match the same punning lack of fit in the frame, where the forceful/noisy havyá- has been poured (áhāvi): the jarring “ghee pressed by stones” calls attention to the more subtle mismatch in the frame. We might almost call this ritual synaesthesia.
