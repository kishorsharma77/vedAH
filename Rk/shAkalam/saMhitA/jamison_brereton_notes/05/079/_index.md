Dawn The meter of this hymn is Paṅkti, with five 8-syllable pādas. The fifth in all vss. is the refrain, a voc. phrase sújāte aśvasūnṛte “o well-born lady, liberal with horses,” which is essentially detachable. So the hymn comes across as standard Anuṣṭubh, with an appended and superfluous refrain. As indicated in the publ. tr., the contents are for the most part uninspired, contrary to most Dawn hymns, though closer inspection reveals more intricate patterns than a superficial reading turned up.
