The phrase “reverberant tankard” (svarír ámatraḥ) is striking, but intelligible in Ṛgvedic context. Indra is compared to a large drinking vessel because of his immense capacity and size, also described in 8cd and 9ab; “tankard” hints at his ability to drink vast quantities of soma and implicitly promises his generosity because he can contain vast quantities of goods. I follow Old in taking all forms of ámatra- as belonging to a single stem (pace Gr, Lub, and EWA). As for ‘reverberant’ (svarí-), it echoes svarā́ḷ, which opens the preceding pāda; it also suggests the deep sound made when a large (empty) vessel is struck and Indra’s own war-cries. (For a possibly similar image, see I.100.12.)
