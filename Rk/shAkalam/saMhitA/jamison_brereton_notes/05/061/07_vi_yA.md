The relativization is loose, at least in the Eng. rendering. Literally it should be “More reliable than a man is a woman who discerns the thirsting one …,” etc.

The lexeme ví √jñā means ‘discern, recognize’, and a full rendering of the implication of these VPS would be something like “who recognizes (that a particular man) is famished …” -- the idea presumably being that, having recognized their plights, she then sees to them, each in his own need. I have folded this two-step process into ‘pay attention to’. If she does see to the needs of each, the third in the series kāmínam ‘the desirous / lusting one’ again introduces the sexual: she feeds, clothes, and has sex with the three in turn, at least by my interpr. The standard tr.

have a tendency to attenuate the third term -- e.g., Klein (DGRV I.432) “the one desiring (aid)” -- but in this saucy hymn I think sex is never far from the surface. I do have to admit, however, that kāmín- is not otherwise used of sexual desire, but has a more general application, incl. to the Maruts in this same cycle (V.53.16).
