somapárvan- ‘soma-joint’ could refer either to the segments of the stalk of the soma plant (e.g., Re) or to the segments of the Soma Sacrifice (e.g., WG). Ge suggests it’s a word play. It is difficult to judge, but I weakly favor the horticultural interpretation.

There is no explicit 2nd ps. in c, but the general interpretation of this pāda as referring to Indra seems correct.
