This vs. is unusually conjunction-heavy, with utá in pāda a (conjoining clauses) and in d (conjoining nouns), and vā 3x in c. In fact there at first appear to be more vā’s than there are constituents to conjoin: yajñásya vā níśitiṃ vā-úditiṃ vā.

However, Klein (DGRV II.195) plausibly explains the first vā as sentential (I would prefer the term ‘clausal’ in this case), connecting pāda b with its relative clause yáḥ ...

ā́naṭ … with its continuation in pāda c. The other two vā’s are subclausal, conjoining the two -ti-stem action noun phrases, níśitiṃ vā-úditiṃ vā, both of which govern the gen. yajñásya, the constituency being interrupted by the clausal vā in Wackernagel’s position.

In c I assume that the verb is a gapped repetition of ā́naṭ. Klein tr. the skeleton of bc as “who has attained … or (has brought about) …,” so I assume he thinks c has a different underlying verb from b. But the full VP níśitim … ā́naṭ in nearby VI.13.4, as well as VI.2.5 níśitim … naśat also in this Agni cycle, establish this as a ritual idiom.

Note the complementary preverbs ní ‘down’ and úd ‘up’ in the conjoined níśitim … úditim. The latter word is not otherwise used as a ritual term; in all its other occurrences it is a loc. and refers to the rising of the sun. Here it seems to refer to the outcome or the progress of the sacrifice, though it could be more narrowly used for the “rising up” of the fire when it is kindled. This is probably the better interpr. because in 2 of the 4 occurrences of níśiti-, VI.2.5 and VIII.19.14, it is implicitly use of the fire.
