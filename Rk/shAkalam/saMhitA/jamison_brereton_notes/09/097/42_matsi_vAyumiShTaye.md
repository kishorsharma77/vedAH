The infinitival dat. iṣṭáye is generally taken to mean “to hasten, for hastening” here (Ge “dass er rasch komme”; Re “afin qu’il se hâte”; Klein GDGRV I.68 “for hastening”; and cf. EWA s.v. EṢ 2 citing Ge’s tr. for just this passage). But I am puzzled as to which root √iṣ the sense ‘hasten’ is supposed to belong to: we have √iṣ ‘seek, desire’ and √iṣ ‘send, set in motion’. It is to the latter that EWA refers this form (and I assume that the others would also connect the two), but either there has to be a de-valencing of the root (from ‘set in motion’ to ‘be in motion’ - but there are no forms to this root with intrans. value) or the form has to be covertly passive (‘to be set in motion’, hence ‘to move’). I think it belongs rather to √iṣ ‘seek, desire’ and means ‘for seeking, for the quest’. In my view all 20 exx. of iṣṭáye can be united under this rubric. See also comm. ad I.112.1 and VII.92.3. In this particular case Vāyu’s quest is for soma, and upon having received it, he benefits us. So the double dative iṣṭáye rā́dhase ca is a bit of a zeugma, in that these beneficial datives are for the benefit of different parties, though the satisfaction of the second depends on the success of the first.
