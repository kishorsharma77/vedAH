Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
10 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn begins, like the last one, with a strong statement of Indra’s relationship with  soma, but it then turns to more general praises of the god (vss. 2–8), with some strik ing similes, metaphors, and etymological figures. The importance of mortal praise and  worship for maintaining Indra’s powers is not forgotten; see verses 7–8 and especially  verse 6, which seems to concern the traffic in praise: inspiration going out from Indra  to the poets and then returning to him as praise (for a similar sentiment and phraseol ogy, see VI.34.1). The last two verses (9–10) ask for Indra’s gifts and protection.
