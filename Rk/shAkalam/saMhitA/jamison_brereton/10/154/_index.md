To a Dead Man  
Yamī  
5 verses: anuṣṭubh  
This hymn has a parallel in the Atharvaveda (XVIIII.2.14–18), where it is found  among the funeral verses, and in the ritual sūtras it is used at the burning of the  corpse. Each verse describes the character and habits of the distinguished fore fathers now resident in the other world, and ends with a refrain urging the dead  man to go and join them there.
