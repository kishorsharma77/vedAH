As indicated in the publ. intro., this verse probably treats the Tānūnaptra.

Although Ge suggests that the yám and yáḥ simply show the free use of the relative pronoun for general subordination, tr. both as ‘wenn’, I think tátra in d is the correlative of both: the Sacrificer has a compact with both the sacrifice itself (ab) and the priest who carries it out (c).

As Old points out, āsīt should no doubt be read as accented ā́sīt; the sketchy transmission of the hymn no doubt accounts for these errors.
