The gen. obj. of ā́yuvate, mádhvaḥ, is hard to interpret; it certainly doesn’t seem likely to be a partitive.

I don’t know what to do with the particle áha, which is oddly positioned in the middle of a pāda interrupting an NP. Re’s “d’un coeur, ah! rempli de crainte” is appealing, but áha doesn’t ordinarily have such an exclamatory value, as far as I can see - and it’s a little too conveniently superimposable on our (both French and English) “ah!”
