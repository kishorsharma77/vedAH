Cows
Śabara Kākṣīvata
4 verses: triṣṭubh
For the protection, thriving, and safe return of the cows, invoking a formidable  range of gods to ensure these goals. In later ritual the first two verses are spoken  when the cows go to pasture, the latter two when they return home.
## 1
Let the wind, joy itself, blow to the ruddy ones. Let them crop plants full  of nourishment.
Let them drink (waters) full of fat, providing riches to the living. Setting  them loose, Rudra, be merciful to our food on the hoof.
## 2
Those who are of the same color, of different colors, of one color, whose  names Agni knows because of the sacrifice,
whom the Aṅgirases brought here by their fervent heat—to those, o
Parjanya, extend great shelter.
## 3
Who raised their own body up among the gods (as oblation), of whom  Soma knows all the colors,
swelling with milk, rich in offspring, grant them to us in our stable, Indra. 4. Prajāpati, having given them to me, in concord with all the gods and the  forefathers,
has sent them here, being well-disposed, to our stable. Might we reside  together with their offspring.
