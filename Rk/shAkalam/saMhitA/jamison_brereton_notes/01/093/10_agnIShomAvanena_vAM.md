All standard tr. take b vṛṣabhásyeva te rávaḥ as the main cl. to the yád cl.

beginning in a, while I take it as a part of that yád cl. There is no way to tell, since the second cl. lacks a verb whose accent or lack thereof would settle the matter.

There are also no semantic implications; I weakly prefer mine because of the fairly emphatic ā́d ‘then, just after that’ beginning the second hemistich.

All tr. take vanínaḥ as ‘trees’ (lit. ‘possessing wood’). This is doubtless the primary sense here, since this sequence of vss. describes a forest fire, but ‘winners’ is also possible, since the metaphorical context is that of a chariot race; see esp. 10a, 11c.
