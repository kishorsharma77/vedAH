As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. is the hardest in the hymn and, as the middle vs., serves as an omphalos. It contains several temporal expressions and thus continues the theme of the passage of time found in the 2nd half of vs. 2, but the rest is rather unclear. My rendering is tentative and also differs considerably from those of others, the details of which cannot be fully covered here.

Already in pāda a the alternation of days and nights is alluded to with the polarized expression ahanyèbhir aktúbhiḥ. Although the adjectival form of ahanyàseems to invite an interpr. whereby the word modifies the adjacent instr. pl.

grā́vabhiḥ, the result, “with the daily pressing stones” (Ge “mit den täglichen Presssteinen”), doesn’t make sense, and I prefer to follow Re in considering it “une variante probable de áhabhir aktúbhiḥ.” Cf. áhobhiḥ ... aktúbhiḥ X.14.9 and, with lexical substitution, dyúbhir aktúbhiḥ (I.34.8, I.112.25, III.31.16).

A more serious problem is figuring out what action is being performed in the first hemistich. In literal terms, the subject, whoever it is, sprinkles the/a superior mace, along with or by means of the pressing stones. Assuming we take the verb ā́ jigharti seriously -- unlike Ge and Re, who tr. contextually (‘schleudert’ and ‘brandit’ respectively), with Ge suggesting a possible derivation from √hṛ not √ghṛ -- the action is difficult to interpret, whoever the subject is. Why would one ‘sprinkle’ a mace? Old, flg. Bergaigne, suggests that the mace is really soma, but although we might think this would get us out of the difficulty, in fact the object of (ā́) √ghṛ is never the liquid sprinkled, but the object that is sprinkled with it.

Working backward from vss. 4-5, which have pretty clear references to Agni, I take Agni as the subject of ā́jigharti here. He prepares the mace by “sprinkling” it with his sparks, a sort of final or symbolic forging, while the soma produced by the pressing stones is sprinkled on the weapon at the same time. The two acts of sprinkling make the weapon ritually fit for use. (Agni’s ‘streaming’ rītí- is found in 4a—another configuration of Agni as a liquid or as controlling liquid.) Under this interpr. the three apparently anomalous forms of ā́√ghṛ in the RV, here and in IV.17.14 and X.6.4, can be given a unified interpr. All three have Agni as subj. (in my view), and in all three Agni “sprinkles” an object with his sparks. See comm. on the two other passages.

The loc. māyíni is a separate problem. The standard view is that it refers to an enemy at whom the vajra is wielded, hence tr. like Ge’s “… schleudert er die beste Keule auf den Zauberischen,” which, as we saw, requires the verb ā́jigharti to be semantically twisted. But the near rhyme māyínī at the end of vs. 1 refers to a positively viewed figure (in my interpr.), the goddess Dawn, and I suggest that māyíni here, which occurs in the same prominent hemistich-final position, also identifies a positive figure -- in fact, Indra. Indra is called māyín- in VIII.76.1 and his māyā́- are often referred to (see the passages listed by Grassmann, s.v., including
