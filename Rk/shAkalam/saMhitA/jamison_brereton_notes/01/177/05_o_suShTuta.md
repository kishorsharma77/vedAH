Ge takes vástoḥ as dependent on vidyā́ma (“Wir Lobsänger möchten … den neuen Tag erleben”), but vástoḥ is almost always a temporal marker elsewhere (e.g., in nearby I.179.1). I think rather that vidyā́ma simply anticipates the identical verb that opens the refrain pāda. For further disc., see comm. ad VI.24.9, whose pāda c is identical to our c (also X.89.17).
