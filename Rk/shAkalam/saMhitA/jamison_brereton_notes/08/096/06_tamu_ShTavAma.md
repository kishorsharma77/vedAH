Ge (so also Gr) takes ávarāṇy asmāt as temporal: “die nach ihm kommen,” whereas I interpret it spatially. Though “later than him” is possible, it seems pleonastic, in that if Indra begat them, they would have to be later than him. The idea is rather that they exist here on earth, below him,, and also that he begot them as subordinates. Cf. vrjánem ̥ ā́varāṇi “these communities here below” (IX.96.7) and bándhūm̐r imā́m̐ávarān “these bonds here below” (IX.97.17), which both seem spatial, not temporal, also.
