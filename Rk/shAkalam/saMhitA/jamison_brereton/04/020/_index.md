Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The general pattern of an invitation/journey hymn is followed here. Indra’s journey  to our sacrifice is treated in the first two verses, with his attendance at the sacrifice  and acceptance of the offerings found in the following two (3–4). The invitation is  summarized in verse 5. His reciprocal obligation to give generously to his worship
ers dominates the rest of the hymn, and without overt mention of the Vala myth,  the poet repeatedly likens Indra’s acts of giving to his opening of the cowpen and  releasing its contents (vss. 6, 8, 9). A subtle reference to the Vr̥tra myth may be  found in verse 7: no “obstructor” (vartár) keeps Indra from giving, using the root vr̥
“obstruct,” found in Vr̥tra, whose name is literally “obstacle.”
The hymn several times uses gambling vocabulary (vss. 3, 8), and there are some  other striking images, such as the two similes in the first half of verse 5.
