The first hemistich here, with the skeleton asyá me dyāvāpṛthivī … bhūtám avitrī́vácasaḥ … “become helpers of this speech of mine, o Heaven and Earth” is somewhat reminiscent of the famous refrain in I.105 vittám me asyá rodasī “take heed of this (speech) of mine, you two world halves,” though with aid rather than mere attention asked of Heaven and Earth. The different ordering of the two genitives asyá and me in the two passagestd conforms to our expectations of the positioning of enclitics.

The syntax of the second hemistich is rather stiff and clotted, with an oblique nominal relative clause (“of which two there is extensive lifetime”) picked up by a long main clause beginning in the middle of pāda c with the 3rd ps. du. prn. té. It is only after some time that we discover that té is an accusative, the object of versefinal dadhe, and that it is doubled by du. enclitic vām, which switches the reference to 2nd ps. The enclitic vām is very oddly placed, smack in the middle of pāda d, not leaning on any of its adjacent elements semantically, as far as I can see. Moreover, puráḥ … dadhe seems to be a phrasal verb, but with the two parts of the phrase distant from each other and separated by extraneous material.
