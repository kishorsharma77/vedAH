This is the most difficult vs. of the sequence and has given rise to multiple contradictory, not to mention ludicrous, interpr. -- among which my own may be numbered (although I certainly think it’s better than eyeballs). Note the two -káforms (kanīnaké(va), arbhaké), indicating slangy, low-register speech and quite possibly associating it with women’s language. (For disc. see my 2008 “Women’s Language in the RV” and 2009 "Sociolinguistic Remarks on the Indo-Iranian *-kaSuffix: A Marker of Colloquial Register.") If the gift is really a woman, then evoking women’s language would make sense.

On vidradhá- ‘undressed, without clothes’ see EWA s.v. As for drupadá- ‘post’, AV VI.63.3 ayasmáye drupadé “on a metal post” shows that the post need no longer be wooden (despite dru-), just as “plastic glasses” does not strike an English speaker as odd or contradictory. As I said in the publ. intro., I think the post refers to the woman’s slender body, with two very prominent breasts, an ideal of a woman’s body also encountered in Classical Skt. lit. The breasts are personified (“little babydolls”) and invested with some autonomy as they move about during sex.

Crosscultural parallels in sexual slang could surely be found.
