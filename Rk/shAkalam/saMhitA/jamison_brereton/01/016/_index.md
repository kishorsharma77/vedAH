Indra  
Medhātithi Kāṇva  
9 verses: gāyatrī  
This is nothing more than an extended invitation to Indra to come to the sacrifice,  with a tempting menu of offerings and praises. One might say about this hymn that  it makes reading the R̥gveda seem easy; it also makes it seem not worth the trouble.
