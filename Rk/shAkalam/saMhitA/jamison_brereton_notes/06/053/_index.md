Pūṣan Although, as noted in the publ. intro., this hymn is remarkably bloodthirsty, there is also a minor theme focusing on poetry and poetic formulation. The word dhī́- ‘poetic vision’ is found in the first and last vss., shaping a faint ring, as well as in vs. 4. And Pūṣan is called kaví- in vs. 5, and his awl is the ‘impeller of the bráhman-’ (brahma-códanī-) in vs. 8.
