ET points out that the verb of ab pári … ábubhojīḥ “you coiled around” might be more appropriate as a description of Vṛtra; it is almost as if Indra is appropriating the qualities of his opponents in addition to his own and thereby showing himself to be even more powerful. The form ábubhojīḥ itself is isolated, the only reduplicated form to the root √bhuj ‘bend’. Kü gives it a lemma in his monograph on the perfect (351-52) but does not commit himself further, beyond stating that the form is a 2nd sg.

preterite “in der statisch-attingenten Bedeutung” and suggesting that there might have originally been a stative perfect that is no longer alive in Vedic. This would allow a plausible analysis of our form as a pluperfect, with a renewed ending -īs, to avoid expected but non-transparent *abubhok. JL points to the mirror-image phonetic echo ubhe ábubhojīr across the pāda boundary.

adhamaḥ in d needs to be read with both pādas, c and d.
