Although vacoyújā is principally a dual acc., modifying the two fallow bays (hárī) as usual, it could also secondarily be taken as an instr. sg., modifying mánasā ‘with mind’. In any case, ‘speech’ and ‘mind’ are implicitly contrasted in this verse, and in addition mánasā contrasts with āsayā́‘by mouth’, referring to the means of creating.
