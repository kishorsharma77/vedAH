Agni
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
7 verses: triṣṭubh
Most of this hymn consists of a vivid depiction of destructive fire raging across  the earth, though the first half-verse establishes a ritual context and the last verse  (7) begs Agni for wealth. The hymn is full of phonetic and etymological figures,  particularly the last, intensely alliterative verse.
