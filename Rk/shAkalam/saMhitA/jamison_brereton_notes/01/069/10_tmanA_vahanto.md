The phrase dúro vy ṛ̀ṇvan echoes ví … aurṇod dúraḥ, which opens the last verse of the preceding hymn (I.68.10) and which itself forms a ring with vy ū̀rṇot of I.68.1.

The tmánā ‘by himself/themselves’ must refer to the priests; since Agni is regularly the subject of √vah, as the conveyor of oblations to the gods and of the gods to the sacrifice, it is here emphasized that others are conveying him.

The last hemistich is identical with the last one of I.66.10, which itself forms a ring with I.66.1. This set of hymns is very tightly knit together! As argued in the art.

cit., this verse marks the completion of the fire’s transformation into the Vaiśvānara fire. Since that fire is identified with the sun, “all cry out on seeing the sun” is a expression of the unified group’s first sight of and recognition of the fire that symbolizes their unity - which has been presented to them by the priests who carry it and throw open the doors for it to be seen in 10ab.
