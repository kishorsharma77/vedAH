The first hemistich, inviting Mitra and Varuṇa to come here and partake of our oblation, seems like a fuller and more straightforward version of 6d āsā́vívāsann áditim just discussed, with the 1st ps. poet substituting for Agni as the enticer of the gods.

In cd the two fronted asmā́kam have somewhat different uses, which are not sufficiently reflected in the published tr. In c the formulation (bráhma) is one produced by us -- ‘ours’ in that sense. But in d we should be the recipients of the heavenly rain; we do not produce it. Ge (/WG) and Re convey the difference more clearly. I would slightly emend the publ. tr. of d to “for us should be …,” supplying a copula with its optative value borrowed from precative sahyā́ḥ in c.
