The first hemistich seems clearly (at least to me) to contrast the ritual soma streams on earth (a) with those in heaven (b), though curiously it does not seem to have caught Lü’s attention. That pl. asaścátaḥ elsewhere (IX.57.1, 62.28) explicitly modifies dhā́rāḥ ‘streams’ makes that identification in b quite likely. See also
