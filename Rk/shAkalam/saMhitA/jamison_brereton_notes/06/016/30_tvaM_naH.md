Note the close sandhi effect in the voc. phrase brahmaṇas kave. As Ge points out, this pāda is a variant of I.18.3 rákṣā ṇo brahmaṇas pate, with the more usual head noun páti-. Because it is part of a voc. phrase and such phrases show close sandhi effects elsewhere, this does not necessarily belong with the other instances of irregular sandhi of -s before kaví-, on which see comm. ad VII.18.2, though that may be a factor.
