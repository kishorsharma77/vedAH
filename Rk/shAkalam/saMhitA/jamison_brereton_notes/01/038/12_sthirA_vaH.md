The change of person between pādas, 2nd pl. vaḥ in a, 3rd pl. eṣām in b, is exactly the same as in I.37.15 and equally inexplicable. I have therefore failed to tr.

eṣām. It is possible, of course, that eṣām doesn’t refer to the Maruts, but to part of the listed equipage, perhaps the chariots - hence “Let your wheel-rims be steady, and (your) chariots and their horses” - but the parallel structure in the previous hymn makes that unlikely.
