The two cmpds índratamā and marúttamā, superlative in form, are generally taken to mean ‘most similar to Indra / the Maruts’ (Gr, Ge, WG). I suppose that is their ultimate purport, but I think the effect is stronger: the Aśvins are said to possess the qualities of those gods in an even higher degree than those gods themselves do.

Idiomatic English would use the comparative: “more Indra than Indra” (or, in a wellknown colloquial expression, at least in my childhood, “more Catholic than the Pope”).
