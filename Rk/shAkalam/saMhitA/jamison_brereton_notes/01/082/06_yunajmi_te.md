With dadhiṣé we can supply either ‘reins’ or (as sometimes elsewhere with √dhā and a loc. of ‘hand’) the vájra- (cf., e.g., VI.45.18 dhiṣvá vájraṃ gábhastyoḥ).

The presence of voc. vajrin in d might support the latter interpr.

The Pp. reads amadaḥ in d. This causes interpretational difficulties: Indra was ordered to leave the ritual ground and drive off to his wife in the immediately preceding verse; he is still here in this verse, so how can he have already become exhilarated in the company of his wife? Re must have recognized the problem, given his tr. “tu t’es (toujours) enivré avec ta femme,” but this doesn’t work very well.

However, nothing prevents us from reading pátnyā madaḥ, with an injunctive, not an augmented form. It is true that injunctive forms are quite rare to this stem, but this does not seem to me a decisive argument. (I now see that WG also take it as an injunctive, independently.)
