A nice example where surface grammar clashes with mythological content and the latter wins. Pāda b, the complex object of ā́vitha ‘you helped’ in a, consists of an infinitival phrase with the obj. of the inf. “attracted” into the dative, while its subject remains acc.: índraṃ vṛtrā́ya hántave “you helped Indra to smite Vṛtra.” But c, a further specification of this obj., contains an acc. sg. masc. participial phrase vavrivā́ṃsam mahī́r apáḥ “obstructing the great waters.” On the surface, the only noun this can modify is índram because this is the only available acc. sg. masc., but of course it is Vṛtra who obstructed the waters. Though vṛtrā́ya appears in the dative, it must be the referent of the acc. participle - thus suggesting that “attraction” in infinitival phrases is a very late and superficial phenomenon. Unless with Re we want simply to denominate it a “formule morphologiquement non adaptée au contexte.” I prefer to think that the poet enjoyed producing the syntactic misdirection.
