In pāda a skambhó diváḥ reminds us of 35d divó viṣṭambháḥ with a diff.

lexical real On tridhā́tu- see comm. ad IX.70.8.

Pāda c aṃśúṃ rihanti matáyaḥ pánipnatam is identical to 31d, save for the first word, which in 31 is śíśum.

In d yádi would be best read yád *ī, both for sense and for meter, since an opening with light syllables in positions 3 and 4 before an early caesura is very rare (see Arnold 194).

Ge tr. nirṇíjam … yayúḥ as “Staat machen” (make a show), based, he says (n.

46d), on śúbhaṃ yā. I see no reason to attenuate the sense of nirṇíj-. As Scar (284- 85) argues, this stem can be both a concrete noun ‘garment’ and an infin. ‘to array’.

The infinitival usages he cites are mostly the dat. nirṇíje (which, in all quoted cases, I take as a noun) and he is uncertain about the usage of this acc. ex. But since the analysis just proposed of yád *ī provides us with an acc. obj., infinitival usage seems best here.
