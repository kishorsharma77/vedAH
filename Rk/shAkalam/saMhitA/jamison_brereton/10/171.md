Indra
Iṭa Bhārgava
4 verses: gāyatrī
This brief hymn makes allusion to four unknown or little-known myths involving  Indra, one per verse. All four verses begin with t(u)vám “you,” and three of the four  (not vs. 2) contain a vocative addressed to Indra—repetitions that provide some  unity to a hymn made up of fragments.
## 1
You, Indra—you furthered this chariot of Iṭat the presser.
You heard the call of the one who has soma.
## 2
You pulled the head of the raging Battler off from his skin.
You went to the house of the one who has soma.
## 3
You, Indra—this mortal Venya
you made slack in an instant, for Āstrabudhna, who had it in mind.
## 4
You, Indra—set this sun in front, though it is behind,
even athwart the will of the gods.
