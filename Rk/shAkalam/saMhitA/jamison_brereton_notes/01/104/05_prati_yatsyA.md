Again, consult the publ. intro. As noted there, I think the unidentified female in b is Dawn, who leads the Ārya forces across the river(s) and against the Dasyu.

The other standard tr. take her rather as Saramā, Indra’s canine sidekick, on the fragile basis of III.31.6: the only point of contact between the two passages being the rather generic jānatī́gāt “recognizing, she went.” I see no reason to introduce Saramā here; Dawn has been anticipated by the apparent reference to the dawns in 4b (pū́rvābhiḥ), and the revealing (ádarśi -- a standard item of Uṣas vocabulary) of the Dasyu’s streambed/strategy could easily happen at dawn.

In d niṣṣapín- is a hapax, but ‘without care, careless’ (√sap ‘serve, care for’) makes sense.
