On ṛjīṣī́see immed. preceding comment.

ámitam must be adverbial, as is recognized by all standard treatments.

I do not see a semantic diff. between the abstracts mahitvá- and mahimán-; what distinguishes them is their metrical shape. The nom. sg. mahimā́is obviously excluded from the cadence, but well suited for the break after a 5-syl. opening; instr.

sg. mahitvā́- works nicely in a Triṣṭubh cadence. Curiously enough English does not seem to have two different abstract formations to ‘great’ (*greatitude, *greatery,

*greathood, etc.) despite the usual flexibility of our language, and so I have tr. both
Skt. words with ‘greatness’.
