Ādityas
Matsya Sāmmada or Mānya Maitrāvaruṇi or many fish caught in a net [bahavo matsyā jālanaddhāḥ]
21 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
According to the Anukramaṇī, a fish (Matsya) or “many fish caught in a net” are  two of the three possible composers of this hymn. Unfortunately, there is not a  scrap of evidence in the hymn itself for these intriguing ascriptions. The poet begs  the Ādityas and their mother Aditi, who is more prominent in the hymn than in  most Āditya hymns (vss. 10–12, 14, 18), for shelter and protection from a range of  dangers and enemies and for continued life for ourselves and our progeny.
