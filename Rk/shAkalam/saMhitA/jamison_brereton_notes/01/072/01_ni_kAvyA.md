The lexeme ní √kṛ, literally ‘make/do down’, idiomatically means to surpass one’s opponent with regard to some quality by “putting” or “bringing” [them] “down.” Indeed the English idiom “put down” is very close, but I chose not to use it because it doesn’t convey quite the right sense with the right case frame. The verb generally takes an acc. of the quality in question; the person who is outdone can be either in the acc. (X.49.8), hence a double acc., or gen. (II.23.12), and there is some disagreement among tr. about which construction we have here, since vedhásaḥ śáśvataḥ can be either gen. sg. or acc. pl. Ge opts for the acc. pl. in the tr., but offers the gen. sg. as alternative in his n.; Old, Re, WG choose the sg., as I have done, though for no principled reason.

The náryā ‘manly powers’ in b contrasts both with kā́vyā in a and amṛ́tāni in d. The first contrast would be between, roughly, warrior skills and verbal skills, the second between human (though of course nṛ́- can often be used of gods, too) and divine. For the latter pairing note that the two acc. pls. are construed with similar verbs: middle participles to reduplicated formations, dádhānaḥ and cakrāṇáḥ.
