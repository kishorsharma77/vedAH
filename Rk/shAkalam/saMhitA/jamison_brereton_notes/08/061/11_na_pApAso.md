Kulikov (339-40, flg. Gotō) does not allow a passive reading for medial forms of √man, but aside from Gotō’s dictum I see nothing against such an interpretation, which fits the passage better than a reflexive one. The hapax árāya- is plausibly taken as a negated form derived from the root √rā ‘give, bestow’ by Mayrhofer EWA s.v. rayí-.

jáḷhu- (i.e., jáḍhu-) is also a hapax with no agreed-upon etymology or meaning. Ge leaves it untr. and Old simply comments “dunkel.” See EWA s.v. for references to previous discussions and suggestions. I wonder if it is not related to jaṭhára- ‘belly’, with MIA voicing of intervocalic obstruent between vowels (cf. Pkt.

jaḍhara- ‘belly’ cited in EWA s.v. jaṭhára- [though not registered in Turner]), with “belly” as the designation of a greedy, voracious person.

The point of the verse seems to be that we don’t want to get a bad reputation for being selfish by grabbing Indra to be our exclusive companion.
