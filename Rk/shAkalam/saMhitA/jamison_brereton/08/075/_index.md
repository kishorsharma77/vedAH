Agni
Virūpa Āṅgirasa
16 verses: gāyatrī arranged in trcas ̥
Agni’s role in the sacrifice and his relationship with the poet-sacrificers is the subject  of the first two conventional tr̥cas (vss. 1–6), but a martial, indeed a belligerent,  strain appears beginning with verse 7. The setting seems to be a contest for cattle  or a cattle raid, and the poet calls on Agni to use his aggressive powers to defeat  encroaching threats and assure victory and the winning of cattle and wealth (vss.  7–13). The hymn ends with general, and less combative, prayers for help for the  sacrificer (vss. 14–16).
