Ge and Re tr. raṇanta as a modal (“sollen sich … erfreuen”; “Que les Maruts se réjouissent …”), as does Hoffmann (259), who explicitly identifies it as a subjunctive, not an injunctive, flg. Re (BSL 33.1: 6-7), who claims that -anta is a regular RVic subjunctive ending. I think a modal value, whether the form is identified as injunctive or subjunctive, is unnecessary and in fact fits the context less well than a preterital reading. Previous vss. refer to the performance of the sacrifice at which the Maruts are present (esp. 1ab and 2). They are now asked to provide benefits in return, and so we might assume that the sacrifice is now over (though 6ab gives me pause), an assumption supported by kṛté with its past reference: ‘what has been/was done’.

In the publ. tr. cid is not tr. I think it is a simple emphatic here “in just what has been done here,” which is somewhat stilted in Eng., or else (perhaps more likely) it actually emphasizes the following word átra: “in what has been done here” -- at our sacrifice, not at someone else’s. So Sāy. It could, of course, mean “also” or “even,” but neither of those makes sense in context -- nor does Ge’s (/Hoffmann’s) “wenigstens” or Re’s “(un peu) même.”
