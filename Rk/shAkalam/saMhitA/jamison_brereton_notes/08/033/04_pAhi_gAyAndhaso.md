“Drink!” is an imperative that the poet Medhyātithi should not be addressing to himself, as opposed to “sing!” I therefore take it as the content of his song, addressed to Indra.

In d Ge takes the last two words rátho hiraṇyáyaḥ as a separate nominal clause “golden is his chariot.” This is possible, but I think it is far more likely a phrase qualifying Indra, despite its slight oddness. Indra can be called a chariot because he comes with lots of goods, like a chariot (see, e.g., I.125.3 vásumatā ráthena), and also because he’s “linked” (sáṃmiślaḥ) to the two horses, as if he were the chariot they are yoked to and pull. Moreover, starting with 4c the rest of the tṛca (4c-6c) consists only of descriptions of Indra in the nominative, arranged in relative clauses. A nominal clause with a different subject would interrupt this structure.
