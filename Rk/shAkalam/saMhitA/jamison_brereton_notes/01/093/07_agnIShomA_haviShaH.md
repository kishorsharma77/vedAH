The three imperatives in b, vītáṃ háryatam … juṣéthām, all belong to roots that ordinarily take accusatives, yet all must be construed with the fronted gen. havíṣaḥ prásthitasya in pāda a. I don’t quite understand the case syntax, but assume that these three verbs have been lumped together generically as verbs of consumption and enjoyment, for which gen. complements are often possible.

In c bhūtám can be either imperative or injunctive and is taken as injunctive in the published translation (as also by Ge and Re). However, since the immediately preceding hymn (I.92.15) contains the clausal diptych hí + imperative, followed by áthā + imperative, exactly matching the structure here, I now think it would be better to interpret bhūtám as impv. here as well: “Become providers …, then establish …” (So WG.) An imperative interpretation also works better with the three abrupt imperatives that precede in b. For further disc. see comm. ad VII.99.3.
