Although nouns not in the vocative case generally lose their accent in vocatival phrases (type sūno sahasaḥ “o son of strength”), the conjoined genitives diváś ca gmáś ca retain their standard accent though being part of the voc. phrase headed by dhūtayaḥ “o shakers” - presumably in part because the pāda needs to begin with an accented word and also because this particular voc. phrase is not only structurally complex (with a conjoined NP as gen.) but also not a fixed idiom. Of course, since diváś ca gmáś ca opens the pāda, it would have to be accented one way or other other, but if it had received default voc. accent we would expect dívaś ca gmaś ca.
