The standard tr. make rather heavy weather of pāda b, where the simile sudúgheva dhenúḥ is nominative, but uṣā́sānáktā, the most likely comparandum, makes most sense as the acc. goal of éṣe in pāda a. (Note in passing that HvN’s accentless eṣe is simply wrong.) The simile “like an easily milked cow” should not apply to the 1st ps. subj. of that verb. To deal with the apparent case mismatch (and to avoid the specious explanation “nominative for accusative in simile”), most interpr.

take b as a parenthetical nominal sentence (e.g., Ge “-- Nacht und Morgen sind wie eine gutmelke Kuh --”; so also Re, Janert [Dhāsi, 29], Narten [Yasna H., 122], WG).

But this seems unnecessary: this is a repeated pāda, found also in VII.2.6, where the dual uṣā́sānáktā is nominative. Since that form is ambiguous, it can be adapted here to an accusative environment, without bothering to adjust the case of the simile. So Bloomfield (ad I.186.4, anticipated by Old).

In cd note the chiastic pairs of sám … ví / ví … sá(m): samāné … vimímānaḥ …, víṣurūpe … sásmin …
