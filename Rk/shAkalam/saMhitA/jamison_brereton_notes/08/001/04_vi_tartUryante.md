Following Old I take both vipaścítaḥ and vípaḥ as nom. pl., rather than taking the latter as a genitive sg. (with Ge et al.). The thought is that the poets and their products that belong to and emanate from the competing sides - that of the stranger and that of our peoples - keep crossing each other in their efforts to reach and attract Indra. For a thorough discussion of the possibilities of this hemistich see Old, who calls it a “Musterbeispiel für Vieldeutigkeit.” The intensive ví tartūryante brilliantly captures the constant roiling motion of these competitive elements.

The abrupt imperative úpa kramasva seems to merit a slangy tr.

nédiṣṭham appears to be functioning proleptically: bring it here so that it will be nearby.
