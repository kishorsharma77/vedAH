As noted ad vs. 4, the person changes from 2nd to 3rd in the middle of this verse. But this is not the only disruption: the main clause of 5cd begins with utá, which has nothing to conjoin. Klein (DGRV I: 451) is puzzled and suggests, somewhat desperately, that the utá “focuses on and emphasizes the second action of the Maruts.” This seems to open the usage of utá unacceptably wide. It is possible instead to see it as an example of “inverse utá,” conjoining the actions of the two clauses of cd, with the parallel verbs ví ṣyanti and vy undanti (so also explicitly Macd, Reader). Or it may be signaling the resumption of 3rd ps. discourse after the 2nd ps.

intrusions of 4cd-5ab.

The inundation of the skin in pāda 4 presumably refers to the wetting of hides in the tanning process (so Ge).
