The accent on ási in d presumably results from its contrastive function in the ca … ca construction. Curiously Old does not comment.

Note the two different words for house in gṛhápatiḥ … dáme, with the former replacing old dáṃpati-. On these various terms for house-lord, see my forthcoming articles “The Term gṛhastha and the (Pre)history of the Householder” (to appear in The Householder in Ancient India: A History of the Gṛhastha, ed. Patrick Olivelle) and “The Double Life of gahapati” (to appear in a forthcoming Fs.).
