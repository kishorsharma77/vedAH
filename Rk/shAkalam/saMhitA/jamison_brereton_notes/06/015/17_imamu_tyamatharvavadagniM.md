Ge and Re take aṅkūyánt- as a positive quality parallel to ámūra-; e.g., Re: “(dieu) faiseur de méandres, (dieu) exempt d’egarement.” I think rather that they are opposites and that the vs. concerns the flight of Agni and his recovery by the gods: note the imperfect ā́nayan (Pp. ā́ánayan, though technically it could be ā́nayan with an injunctive). Though Agni sought to elude the gods by taking a circuitous course, they found him and brought him straight back from the dark depths of the water. The “dark places” can of course also refer to the night, after which the ritual fire is kindled, but I think the primary reference is mythological.
