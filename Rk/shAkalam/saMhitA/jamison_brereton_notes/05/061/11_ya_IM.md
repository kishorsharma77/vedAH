As indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. marks the beginning of the second, more conventional hymn in this composite, at least in my analysis.

Technically speaking ‘horses’ should be in parens.

It is not clear if īm has its usual acc. function: it could anticipate mádhu in b, though that seems somewhat distant and that participial phrase is otherwise fully contained in b; it could function as a reflexive marker (“drive themselves”); or it may be one of the rare instances of functionless īm.

I have silently depluralized śrávāṃsi, since ‘fames’ is not English. Perhaps the point here is that each Marut has his own śrávas, though, since they are seldom distinguished, this may be overthinking it.
