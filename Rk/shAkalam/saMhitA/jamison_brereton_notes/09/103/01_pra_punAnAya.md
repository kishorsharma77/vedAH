Ge takes ab as a nominal sentence, separate from c, with vácaḥ the nom. subj.: “… wird eine Rede angehoben.” Re takes ab independently as well, but supplies a 1st ps. verb, which introduces needless complications. Although I was tempted by Ge’s interpr., there are two problems: 1) It leaves the opening preverb prá orphaned. Though Gr lists a prá úd √yam ‘die Stimme erheben’, in fact he registers it only for this passage, which does not inspire confidence in the lexeme, and furthermore having one of two preverbs in tmesis with a ppl. might be unusual.

If we do not separate ab from c, prá can be construed with the verb bharā in c in the common lexeme prá √bhṛ. 2) The vácaḥ in b has to be resupplied in c to provide the frame for the simile bhṛtíṃ ná, whereas if there is no break, acc. vácaḥ is readily available.

In c the verb bharā can be either 1st sg. subjunctive or 2nd sg. impv. There are no implications either way. With Ge/Re/Ober I go for the 1st ps. subj.

As noted above, it is only in this vs. that a separable 4-syl. final pāda seems likely: the 3rd sg. pf. subj. jújoṣate forms a single-word clause, with decisive change of subject. As also noted above, this verb echoes juṣánta in the 4-syl. final pāda juṣánta yát (5d) in the twinned hymn IX.102. This echo may account for the middle voice of jújoṣate; the well-attested pf. subj. jújoṣa- is otherwise only active, while the them. aor. juṣá- is overwhelmingly middle. The unexpected voice of jújoṣate is disc.

by Old and probably accounts for why Gr (also BR; see Old) interprets it rather as a dat. sg. act. part. to an otherwise unattested pres. stem, even though we should expect a weak stem *jújuṣant-. Not to mention that such a participle would require that the stem had been reinterpr. as a present. Though this is not a difficult leap, since the subjunctive has accent on the redupl., as opposed to the finite pf., which has standard pf. accent (jujóṣa, jujuṣúḥ), nonetheless, in the absence of unambig. present forms, it seems best to assign the subjunctive to the existing pf. stem. Ge, Re, Lub all take it as a finite verb, not a part.
