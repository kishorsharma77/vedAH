Having described in the previous vs. what a (properly performed) sacrifice can get us, the poet now tells us what we have to do to perform this sacrifice properly.

On the pf. subjunctives here, see my 2016 “The Vedic Perfect Subjunctive and the Value of Modal Forms to Tense/Aspect Stems” (Fs. J L. García Ramón], with disc. of the pf. subjunctives in this verse as well as the pres. and aor.

subjunctives in vss. 7-9. There I specifically dispute Kü’s interpr. (340, also 212, 595) of the pf. subj. as functioning “zur Bezeichnung der vollendeten Handlung für den generellen Fall” (i.e., “… gebracht hat,” etc.).
