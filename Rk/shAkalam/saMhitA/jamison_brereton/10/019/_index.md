Cows
Mathita Yāmāyana or Bhrgu V ̥ āruṇi or Cyavana Bhārgava
8 verses: anuṣṭubh, except gāyatrī 6
This simple, repetitive, but charming call to the cows to come home is the final  hymn of the Yama collection, though its connection to the other hymns in the cycle,  especially the funeral hymns that immediately precede it, is unclear. The signature  idiom in this hymn is “turn back,” and perhaps it was attached to the Yama cycle on  thematic grounds, because the first verses of the preceding hymn, X.18, concern the  return to life of the living after the funeral of their dead kinsman (see esp. X.18.3).
