Indra  
Krṣ̥ ṇa Āṅgirasa  
11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10–11  
This second of Kr̥ṣṇa Āṅgirasa’s three eleven-verse Indra hymns has very clear ties  to the previous one, X.42. They share the last two verses (10–11), as well as lexicon  and phraseology. Yet the two hymns are thematically distinct, and X.43 lacks the  carefully balanced reciprocity of X.42. The focus here is on liquids—on nourishing  streams of water (vss. 3, 6–8) as well as on soma (vss. 2, 4, 6–8)—and on finding  the sun or the light (vss. 1, 4, 5, 8). These themes together evoke the triumphant  progress of the Ārya, conquering rivers and finding sunlit space, which is mythically  embodied in Indra’s release of the waters confined by Vr̥tra indirectly reflected in  verse 8b. This recourse to the mythic model accounts for the references to Manu,  the primal Ārya sacrificer (vss. 4, 8).  
One can point to a nice index of the different uses even shared elements are put  to in the two hymns X.42 and X.43: identical or almost identical phrases assign  roles to exactly opposite personnel. Thus, the phrase “fix desire on someone” (√śri  kā́mam locative) is found in both X.42.6b and X.43.2b; in the former Indra has  fixed his desire on us, while in the latter I have fixed my desire on Indra. Similarly, in  the elaborate gambling simile found almost identically in X.42.9abc and X.43.5ab it  is the mortal who is the subject in X.42 and Indra in X.43.
