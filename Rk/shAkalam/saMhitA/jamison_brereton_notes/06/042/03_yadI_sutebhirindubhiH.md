I take yádī as representing yád ī with the enclitic acc. ī, parallel to īm in the last vs. Note that ī here is pre-C, while īm in 2a is pre-V.

As Ge notes (n. 3cd) there is some uncertainty about the subj. and goal of the verbs here -- Indra or Soma. I take the subject in both cases to be Indra. In c védā víśvasya “he knows of it all” echoes 1b víśvāni vidúṣe “to the one who knows all things,” an unequivocal ref. to Indra. I think there is a contrast between c and d of a familiar type: Indra could go to any soma ritual (“knows of it all”) but comes just to our soma (táṃ-tam íd).
