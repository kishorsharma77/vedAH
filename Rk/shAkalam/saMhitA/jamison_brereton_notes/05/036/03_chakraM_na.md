The slightly “off” nature of the similes in this hymn continues here. In ab the point of comparison between the rolling wheel and the poet’s mind is the trembling (vepate). The cause of the trembling -- fear -- is applicable only to the mind, not the wheel.

As disc. in the publ. intro., ráthād ádhi “from the chariot” is a curious phrase, and the standard treatments struggle with it. Both Ge and Old think that the singer is expressing a wish for a chariot, but it is hard to see how to make that work syntactically. WG (in n.) suggest that it’s either Indra’s chariot or that it represents the poet’s hymn, but neither of these fits the context well. As indicated in the publ.

intro., I think this is a punning allusion to the poet’s patron Śruta-ratha (lit. ‘having a famous chariot’), praised in the dānastuti in vs. 6. In this scenario the hemistichinitial ablative, referring to the patron, is linked to the hemistich-final word purūvásuḥ, referring to the poet. Though Ge (/WG) take this as a PN, giving it its full lexical meaning (‘having many goods’) makes the verse work better. The singer praises Indra on behalf of his patron Śrutaratha, in order to become “One of many goods” -- from/because of (Śruta)ratha. As Mayrhofer points out (PN, s.v. purūvásu- ), purūvásu is synonymous with Prabhūvasu, the name of the poet acdg. to the Anukramaṇī, so the vs. puns both on the name of the poet and on that of the patron.

This might be clearer in the publ. tr. if it were reordered: “Surely the singer will now praise you … (to become) one possessing many goods from the (Famous-)chariot?
