This vs. chains rel. clauses, with the gen. rel. yásya in b referring to the soma in a, while nom. yáḥ in cd refers to Indra, who first appears in the rel. cl. of b.

It is difficult (though perhaps not impossible) to construe ví … hán ‘smash apart’ with the acc. cyautnā́‘exploits’ in c as well as the more likely object dehyàḥ ‘walls’ in d. It is therefore best to follow Ge (also Hoffmann, Injunk. 168) and supply a form of √kṛ or the like in c.
