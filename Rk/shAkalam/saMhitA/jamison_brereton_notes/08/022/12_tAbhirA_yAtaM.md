On viśvápsu- see comm. ad I.148.1.

Old explains 3rd pl. vāvṛdhúḥ as metri causa for du. *vāvṛdháthuḥ, and this is accepted by Ge. But the only other passage in which krívi- is found as a clear PN (though cf. V.44.4, VIII.51.8 [Vālakh.], IX.9.6 for more dubious exx.) is in a nearby Sobhari hymn, in which he is favored by the Maruts (VIII.20.24 yā́bhir daśasyathā krívim “with which you favor Krivi”). The yā́bhiḥ there has the same referent as here, namely ūtíbhiḥ ‘forms of help’ and vāvṛdhúḥ is a semantic variant of daśasyathā. I therefore think it very likely that the plural verb is correct and that this is an allusion to the Maruts’ aid to Krivi. Recall that in vs. 1c, at least by my interpr., the Aśvins also follow the Maruts’ lead, also and identically 14b, and they are addressed as Rudras (that is, Maruts) in 14c.
