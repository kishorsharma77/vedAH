In addition to the inter-verse echoes just noted, alliteration in 2c mánasā manīṣā́and 2d pratnā́ya pátye. JL adds 2a práya iva prá yaṃsi.

bā́dhe in 2b is universally taken as a dat. infinitive (as it is in I.132.5), but this makes semantic difficulties because √bādh means ‘thrust, press, oppress’. Ge’s “um (ihn) … zu nötigen(?),” Re’s “pour contraindre (le dieu),” and WG’s “um (ihn) … zu überhäufen” thus misrepresent the sense of the verb. The √bādh is esp. common with the preverbs ápa and ví in the meanings ‘thrust away, thrust apart’, but I here take the prá of pāda a with both verbs (bhárāmi and bā́dhe) in pāda b. As for morphology, I take bā́dhe as a 1st sg. mid. pres. (the root is always inflected in the middle), rather than as an infinitive, which allows the root to maintain its standard sense: I push the hymn toward Indra with particular forcefulness. As a finite verb, bā́dhe owes its accent to its initial position in the new clause.

suvṛktí- is a bahuvrīhi specialized for praise hymns (and occasionally the gods who receive them) and is often simply tr. ‘praise(-song)’ (e.g., Ge ‘Preis’ here). I prefer to render it literally; -vṛktí- belongs to the root √vṛj ‘twist’, and the English idiom “good twist” refers to particularly clever turns in a plot or other verbal products.

Most tr. take c with d, not ab. This is possible, but not necessary.
