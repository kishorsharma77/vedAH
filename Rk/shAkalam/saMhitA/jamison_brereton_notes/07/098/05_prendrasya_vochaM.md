The first hemistich préndrasya vocam prathamā́kṛtā́ni, prá nū́tanā maghávā yā́cakā́ra is a variant on the famous opening of I.32: I.32.1ab índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi prá vocam, yā́ni cakā́ra prathamā́ni vajrī́. The two contain almost all of the same elements (prá vocam, índrasya, prathamā́(ni), yā́(ni) cakā́ra, nú / nū́tanā), with variation only with vīryā́ni ≅ kṛtā́ni and different epithets of Indra, maghávā / vajrī́.

Nonetheless the distribution of elements between clauses and the word order in each clause are significantly different. This variation is typical of RVic formulae, which 127 generally do not follow a fixed template and are not sensitive to meter alone (both vss. in question are Triṣṭubhs).
