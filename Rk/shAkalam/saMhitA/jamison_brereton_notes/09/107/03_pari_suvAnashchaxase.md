Both Ge and Re make this vs. a separate cl., supplying a verb (“fliesst,” “coule”), generated from pári srava in 2a, suggested by the init. pári in 3a. This is certainly possible, but since this vs. is an afterthought to the pragātha, I take it as dependent on vs. 2, specifically 2ab, simply stringing together more descriptors of soma.

Note cákṣase … vicakṣaṇáh.
