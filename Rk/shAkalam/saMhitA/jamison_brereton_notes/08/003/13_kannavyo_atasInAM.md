It is generally, and reasonably, accepted (e.g., Gr, Old, EWA s.v. atasī́-) that the hapax atasī́nām belongs with atasā́yya-, attested twice, so its meaning depends on our interpretation of the latter - generally held to mean ‘to be called/praised’. However, I take atasā́yya as a negated gerundive to √taṃs ‘shake’ (see I.63.6), and so atasī́- should mean ‘unshakeable, unshaking, firm’. In context here, I assume that it refers to the stable, fixed elements of the cosmic world and the standard subjects of poetry. This may implicitly contrast with návyaḥ ‘anew’, sketching the usual tension between the poet’s desire to produce a new song and the fact that his topics are preordained.

This category of possible atasī́poetic topics is then exemplified by the sun in pāda d — a subject that, despite its greatness, does not match the greatness of Indra.

This interpretation of cd follows Old; Ge switches the objects of participle and main verb, taking svàr with ānaśuḥ and mahimā́nam with gṛṇántaḥ: “Denn noch nicht haben die, welchen seine indrische Grösse besingen, die Sonne erreicht.” Although word order is hardly a reliable guide to RVic interpretation, the adjacency of pādainitial svàr gṛṇántaḥ weakly favors the Old interpretation, which also makes more sense.
