Another verse with unclear referents and no main clause. I take the subject to be the god Vāyu, who has inspired the human patron (imám in a) to give the poet a splendid dakṣiṇā. If Vāyu (deified wind) is the subject, tmánā lit. ‘by his breath’ is a nice touch.

In c Ge takes araṭvé ákṣe as a PN, and it is certainly tempting. But, although the second part of that pāda is a PN, interpreting all difficult phrases as names is a practice to be avoided, and Mayrhofer (EWA s.v. araṭvá-; also PN s.v.) rejects the name interpretation in favor of “aus dem Holz der araṭu-Baumes” (Wagenachse).

There is no way to be certain.
