Gautama’s penchant for clever exploitation of syntactic possibilties returns in this verse, after a series of unremarkable Uṣṇih verses (13-16). The verb in b, cakráthuḥ, by my interpretation takes two different types of predicates and exhibits slightly different root meanings: in pāda a “make your call to heaven,” that is, make the call reach heaven; in b “make, i.e., create, light.” I am in agreement with the standard tr. of pāda b, but diverge from them in a, where Ge (/WG) supply a separate verb (“erhebt”) to govern ślókam and interpret ā́diváḥ temporally (“zu dieser Stunde des Tages”), not spatially. Although ā́diváḥ is sometimes used temporally (e.g., in the expression trír ā́diváḥ), I take the ā́here in the meaning “all the way to” (Gr’s “Praep. mit folgendem Abl. … bis an, bis hin (räumlich)”). This usage of ā́was prepared for in the immediately preceding vs., 16a asmád ā́“all the way to us” (though in opposite order). For a closely parallel expression, in a Dawn hymn, cf. III.61.4 ā́ntād [i.e., ā́ántād] diváḥ ... ā́prthivy ̥ ā́ḥ “all the way to the end of heaven and of earth.” For the ślóka- reaching heaven, cf. I.83.6, 190.4, and for ślókam as object of √kṛ, IV.53.3.
