Unaccented niyutvate in bc appears to be a voc. to an otherwise unattested -istem niyutvati-, whose formation would be morphologically peculiar (a secondary -istem built to a -vant-stem?!). It must be a nonce manipulation of the standard -vantstem niyútvant-. As Re points out, vocatives in -pate may have had some influence in producing this rhyme form. Since Vāyu is almost the only referent of niyútvant-, it is highly unlikely that the form represents a dative to the -vant-stem that lost its accent for some reason.
