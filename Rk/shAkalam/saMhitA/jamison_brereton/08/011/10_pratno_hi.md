For as the ancient one to be invoked at the ceremonies, the Hotar both  from of old and also anew, take your seat.  
Give pleasure to your own body, o Agni, and win good fortune for us  through sacrifice.  
Hymns 12–18 form the third group of hymns in Maṇḍala VIII, which, as Oldenberg  notes in his Prolegomena (1888: 214), clearly belong together, despite the internal  absence of poets’ names and the varying attributions of the Anukramaṇī. All but  the last of these hymns (VIII.18 [Ādityas]) are dedicated to Indra and arranged  properly by descending numbers of verses.
