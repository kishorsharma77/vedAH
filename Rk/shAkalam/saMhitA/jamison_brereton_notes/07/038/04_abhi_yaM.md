On the close parallel to our pāda a in the previous hymn, see comm. ad VII.37.7.

The sequence váruṇaḥ … mitrā́so aryamā́presents a twist on the usual trio of the principal Ādityas, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman, since mitrā́saḥ is plural and, as Ge suggests (n. 4d), must be a word play, referring to the common noun mitrá- ‘ally’.

Obviously the god Mitra must also be referenced, with mitrā́saḥ found in Mitra’s usual place in the sequence of names.
