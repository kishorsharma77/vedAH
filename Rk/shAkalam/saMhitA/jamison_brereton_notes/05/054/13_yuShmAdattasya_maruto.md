The verb in d, rāranta, presents difficulties both morphologically and semantically. Formally it has received a variety of analyses: Gr classifies it (impossibly) with √radh ‘subdue’; as Old notes, in context it would best belong to √rā ‘give’, but it is hard to make this work formally. Given the long redupl.

characteristic of the pf. to √ran ‘enjoy’, the form most likely belongs there. Lub.

classifies it as a med. (3rd sg.) injunc. to that root, but there are no other med. forms to this stem or indeed to the root (raṇáyanta being an -anta replacement). I think we are therefore stuck with the formally most likely analysis, given by Kü, as 2nd pl. pf.

impv., with (as often) irregular full grade (see also Ge n. 13d). This poses problems semantically. It should mean ‘enjoy’, with the Maruts as subject. The gapped obj. is qualified by sahasrín- ‘possessing/in thousands’; as Re points out, this is a stable epithet of rayí- ‘wealth’. And this is the problem: the Maruts have just given us wealth; we should be the ones enjoying it. Gods never enjoy wealth -- they distribute it. Ge suggests in his n. that the thousandfold wealth they enjoy is “in Gestalt von Opfern,” which is certainly a good try (probably the best available). Old tries to make the verb into what looks like a reflexive causative: “macht [den Reichtum] bei uns sich erfreuen” -- that is, the Maruts should make the wealth be happy to stay by us. WG go one step further in the causativization process: “(An diesem Reichtum) … macht, dass man sich hier bei uns daran freue … am tausendfachen.” But these last two attempts to separate the Maruts from the enjoyment are unconvincing, because no other forms to this stem show this causative tendency. I think we must stick with the meaning imposed by parallel forms (so also Re) and deal, perhaps as Ge does, with the Maruts enjoying riches.
