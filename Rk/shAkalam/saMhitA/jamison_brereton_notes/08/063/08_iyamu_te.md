As noted in the publ. intro., “the turning of the wheel” (cakrásya vartaním) recalls the later designation for a universal monarch cakra-vartin ‘turner of the wheel’. The association of cakráṃ with √vṛt ‘turn’ is found elsewhere in the RV (cakráṃ ná vrttám ̥ I.155.6 = IV.31.4 = V.36.3; and a number of VPs, e.g., I.164.11 várvarti cakrám, II.11.20 ávartayat sū́ryo ná cakrám), but this seems the passage most implicated in power and sovereignty.
