Agni Jātavedas
Śyena Āgneya
3 verses: gāyatrī
Another slight hymn to Agni, this time with his common epithet Jātavedas. The  focus of this hymn is the sacrifice and Agni’s role in it.
## 1
Spur forth now Jātavedas, the prizewinning horse,
to sit here on this ritual grass of ours.
## 2
For this Jātavedas here, whose heroes are poets, who grants rewards, I rouse forth a great praise hymn.
## 3
The bright beams of Jātavedas that convey the oblation among the gods, with them let him impel our sacrifice.
