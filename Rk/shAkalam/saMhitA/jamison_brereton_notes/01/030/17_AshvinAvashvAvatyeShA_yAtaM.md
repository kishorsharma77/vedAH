śávīra-. Although this may just have a suffix -īra-, it is tempting to see it as a bahuvrīhi containing a Caland form śavi- (root śū; cf. śū́ra-) plus írā- ‘refreshment’, so ‘possessing powerful refreshment’. For the accent, see the many compounds with śuci-, e.g., śúci-jihva- ‘having a blazing tongue’. If this is correct, the translation of the same word in I.3.2 should be modified. There it modifies dhī́- ‘insight’, which might not be as apt, but thoughts and hymns that provide refreshment are not foreign to the RVic conceptual universe. Although we might expect *śuvi-, ET suggests comparing presumed Caland forms RV ákravihasta- and PN dabhī́ ti-, which apparently show full grade of the root.

The neut. adjectives gómat and híraṇyavat are generally taken to refer directly to the gifts that the Aśvins will provide us (e.g., Ge “Rinderbesitz … Goldbesitz (sie uns)!” But (as Ge suggests in his note) in I.92.16 and VIII.22.17, where the pāda is repeated, the adjectives modify vártiḥ ‘circuit, course’, in turn the object of forms of √yā ‘drive’ in VIII.22.17 (and often elsewhere). Since 17b contains yātam, I supply vártiḥ here as well.
