svávṛṣṭi- is found only here (and 14c below, in the same phrase), and the etymological identity of vṛṣṭi- is not clear. Easiest (with Gr) would be to take the second member as vṛṣṭí- ‘rain’, but ‘having his own rain’ doesn’t make much sense.

Ge (n. to 14bc) connects it with várṣman- ‘height’, várṣiṣṭha- ‘highest’, vṛ́ṣan- ‘bull’, tacitly positing a root √vṛṣ ‘be high/great’ and tr. ‘Eigengrösse’. One of the difficulties with this interpretation is that the word should be a bahuvrīhi (so Old) not a karmadhāraya, judging from parallel formations (cf. svá-yukti, svá-vṛkti [pace Gr, Old]). I prefer the interpretation that links the word to the IE root *uer̯ ǵ ‘work’, found in Aves. varəz (and of course Engl. work, Grk. ἔργον)(see EWA s.v. svávṛṣṭi-).

So, evidently, Re: “son action propre,” though Re also takes it as a karmadhāraya.

Because of the formal parallels, I interpret it as a bahuvrīhi ‘having his own work’, even though this causes some problems: in this clause Indra must be referred to both in accusative, in this compound, and in the genitive, in the phrase asya yúdhyataḥ, which depends on máde. Nonetheless, as usual I don’t feel we can ignore grammar whenever it complicates interpretation.
