You superior men, you have become the good workers who press soma  for Indra—you stones.
Every thing of value of yours is for the heavenly domain; every good  thing of yours for the earthly presser.
The next two hymns (77–78), attributed to Syūmaraśmi Bhārgava and dedicated  to the Maruts, share an unusual metrical structure and a rhetorical scheme.  Although according to the Anukramaṇī the meter is triṣṭubh, in fact in X.77  only the last three verses (6–8) really conform to that meter, and in X.78 only the  last (8). Most of the rest of the verses have eleven-syllable pādas, as is diagnostic  of triṣṭubh, but clear jagatī cadences, an even more diagnostic test. As Oldenberg  has shown (1888: 92–95), most such pādas have an opening of five syllables, end
ing with a light syllable (regularly ná “like”), followed by two heavy syllables,  the first of which seems to substitute for the double-light break usual after an  opening of five. (There is also often a word-break after these two heavy syllables,  seeming to produce a second caesura in the line.) The apparent equivalence of  the heavy sixth syllable with two light syllables introduces a principle of substi
tution or responsion not otherwise found in Vedic, or most Classical Sanskrit,  meters, a principle that only achieves prominence in the Āryā meter quite pos sibly deriving from Middle Indo-Aryan.
