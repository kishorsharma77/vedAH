For juhuranta see comm. ad I.43.8; I take the form to √hvṛ ‘go crookedly’, not √hṛ ‘anger, be angry’. The point here is that the gods and the ancestors, who themselves know the path/word, should not keep us from following this same ritual cursus. There is no question of anger that I can see.

The standard interpr., that c refers to the beacon of the kindled ritual fire visible between heaven and earth, is surely correct. This kindled fire is referred to more straightforwardly in the next vs., 3c sámiddhe agnaú.
