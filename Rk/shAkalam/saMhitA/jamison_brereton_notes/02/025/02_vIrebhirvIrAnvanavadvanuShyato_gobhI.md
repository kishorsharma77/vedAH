Ge, Re, Schmidt (Bṛhaspati und Indra, 113) take pres. act. part. vanuṣyatáḥ here as gen. sg. dependent on acc. pl. vīrā́n (e.g., Schmidt “… die Mannen des Angreifenden”). I find this extremely unlikely, given that the same word in the same etymological figure in 1a and in the following hymn, II.26.1a, must be acc. pl. The acc. pl. ṛghāyatáḥ at the end of 3a with the same morphological structure also supports this analysis.
