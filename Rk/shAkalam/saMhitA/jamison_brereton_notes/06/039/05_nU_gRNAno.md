Note that there are some echoes of vs. 1 in this final vs. The singer in the dative gṛṇaté is found in both vss., immediately after the caesura (1d, 5a); íṣaḥ ‘refreshments’ opens the pāda in 1d and 5b; and there is a teasing reflection of pādainitial ápā(ḥ) (1c ‘you have drunk’) in pāda-initial apá(ḥ) (5c ‘waters).
