Very condensed expression. The first two long pādas characterize Indra as a giver (dadí- 3x) of various desirable things. The third pāda, a mere four syllables, implicitly calls on Indra to actualize this identity by making the gifts.

The expression “legacy to/for the body/self” (rékṇas tanvè) probably stands for a son, as Ge points out in his n.

The short final pāda nūnám átha is curiously formed. There are no other examples of this word sequence, but nūnám has a tendency to be followed by a di- or trisyllable beginining with a- (though usually heavy syl), e.g., nūnám aśyāḥ, nūnám anyā́. Moreover, átha is almost always initial in pāda or clause, so its presence in this position must be signalling something special, which I take to be a peremptory command (English “now then!” corresponds nicely). Note that it echoes verse-final yáthā of 14 and that it again takes final position at the end of 16.
