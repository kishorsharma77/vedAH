As HvN remark in their metrical comm., although the Anukramaṇī identifies the meter of this vs. as Atiśakvarī or Aṣṭi, it appears simply to consist of 5 Jagatī pādas. That the fifth pāda is a simple variant of the fourth makes it likely that the vs. is just a version of Jagatī.

The “son of the formulation” (brahmaputrá-) is presumably the formulator (brahmán-) himself, as the standard tr. take it.
