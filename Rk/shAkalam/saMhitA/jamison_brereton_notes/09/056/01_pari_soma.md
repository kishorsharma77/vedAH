The problem in this vs. is how to construe neut. ṛtám bṛhát. Is it an acc., and if so, is it a goal, like vā́jam in the next vs. (“rushes to the lofty truth”), or an expression of the way loosely construed with pári (“rushes around the lofty truth”)? Or is it a nom. and therefore appositional to sómaḥ. Ge (and to some extent Re) seem to follow the “way” interpr., as does Lü (582) in his first rendering. But he then rejects this (on somewhat contorted grounds) and, flg. Ludwig, goes for a nom. apposition (or nominal predicate). On the basis of IX.107.17, 108.8 (see also 66.24), I also opt for the appositional interpr. Vs. 2 also contains a nominal apposition, dhā́rā apasyúvaḥ, at least by my analysis.
