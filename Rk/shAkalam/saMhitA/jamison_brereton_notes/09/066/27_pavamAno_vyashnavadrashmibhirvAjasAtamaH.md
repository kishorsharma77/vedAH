In this vs. we seem to have returned to the identification of Soma with the sun, as shown esp. by raśmíbhiḥ “with his rays” - this instr. pl. being reserved almost exclusively for the sun’s rays (see, e.g., nearby IX.61.8 sū́ryasya raśmíbhiḥ). The image is of the sun / Soma pervading space, with Soma’s rays being the traces of the golden liquid as it spreads across the filter.
