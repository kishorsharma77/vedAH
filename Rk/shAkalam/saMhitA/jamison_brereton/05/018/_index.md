Agni
Mr̥ktavāhas Dvita Ātreya
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5
This hymn is a dānastuti, a praise of generous patrons. Renou calls it a dānastuti for  the whole preceding sequence of hymns. Dvita, who calls himself, perhaps jokingly,  mr̥ktávāhas “him of the broken vehicle,” summons Agni to reward Dvita’s patrons.  Agni should give them fame, although this fame is also partly and directly created  by the hymn itself. They deserve this reward because they have generously given  Dvita a gift of many horses (vss. 3, 5). The hymn praises Dvita as well, if indirectly,  when it mentions the “brilliant insight” of the singer (vs. 4), which because of him  exists among the patrons.
