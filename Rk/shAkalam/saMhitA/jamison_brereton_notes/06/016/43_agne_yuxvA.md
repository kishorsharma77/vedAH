The hí in the impv. clause is somewhat disturbing, since there is no following impv. in this vs. to which the hí impv. clause could serve as basis.

However, 44a contains two impvs. that logically follow the yukṣvā́‘yoke!’ -- namely yāhi ā́vaha “drive and convey here!” and so the usual use of hí in impv. clauses can be seen here, across two vss.
