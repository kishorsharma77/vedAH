This vs. presents both number and person disagreement, the first more acute than the second. As noted above, the vs. begins with the dual NA prn. tā́, surely referring to the Aśvins, and this 1st pāda ends with an apparent dual part. cakramāṇā́ presumably modifying the prn. But the next pāda contains a plural verb rurucuḥ (rurucū in sandhi), which cannot take the dual as subject -- nor as object. (Because of its sandhi position cakramāṇā́could instead reflect underlying pl. -ā́ḥ, but the initial tā́seems almost designed to anchor the participle as dual as well.) Curiously both Ge and Kü (431) tr. the dual NP as subj. of the pl. verb without comment -- either because of a rare grammatical lapse on their parts or because they view it (without comment) as an example of improper agreement. (It is certainly true that a dual

*rurucatuḥ would be metrically disastrous, so lax haplology would be thinkable.)
I believe that we must take the number and the number disharmony seriously, and I therefore take pādas a and b as separate clauses. The first lacks a finite verb.

We can either consider the participle as predicated (“they two [are] striding …”) or, my preference, as pendant to 1cd, with dual its subj. As noted in the publ. intro., there is another likely enjambment between vss. 2 and 3. The next question is the identity of the pl. subj. of d. There is one pl. form in pāda a: instr. pl. śúcibhiḥ. Ge and Kü take this as referring to the rájobhiḥ ‘spaces’ in b, but Re suggests that it ancitipates the horses (áśvaiḥ) in 3bc. If we accept Re’s identification of the ‘gleaming ones’ as horses, this provides a possible pl. subj. for rurucuḥ. As gleaming ones themselves, they could “shine the radiant beam of the chariot” through the spaces. This may make them sound a little like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, but at least it avoids a grammatical solecism.

The ps. disagreement is, by contrast, very mild and standard RVic practice: the dual subj. returns in 2cd but as 2nd ps. rather than 3rd, as we learn by the verb yāthaḥ late in pāda d.

Note c purū́várāṃsi, a rhyme form to urū́várāṃsi ending 1d.
