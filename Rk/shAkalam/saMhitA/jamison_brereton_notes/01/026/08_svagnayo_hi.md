Although most tr. implicitly take pāda a as subordinated to b (e.g., Ge. “Denn wenn …, so…”), again the ca suggests rather that they are coordinate structures, with pāda a a nominal sentence (svagnáyaḥ predicated of devā́saḥ) coordinated with the finite verb dadhiré in b. This verb is accented because it is under the domain of hí in a. In this reading, pāda c functions as the main cl. of ab. I also supply ‘him’ (=Agni) as first object of dadhiré, again unlike most tr.

(eg., Ge “so bringen sie auch uns Erwünschtes”). For the reasons for this in the structure of the hymn, see disc. in intro.
