As indicated in the publ. intro. I take the introductory íti here as a mark that the preceding vs. is the quoted praise referred to by iti stutā́so asathā “thus shall you be praised.” Re comments that this is a relatively rare passage with íti not close to direct speech. But my interpr. avoids that.
