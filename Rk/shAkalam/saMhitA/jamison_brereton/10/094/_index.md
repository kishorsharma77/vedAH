Pressing Stones
The snake Arbuda Kādraveya
14 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5, 7, 14
This second hymn to the pressing stones (for the relations among the three press ing-stone hymns, see the introduction to X.76) is a playful and imaginative praise  of these implements for extracting the soma juice from the plant. The stones are  animatized throughout—as human workers, as hungry bulls, as birds, as antelopes,  as horses. But there is special emphasis on them as speakers. The first four verses  begin with “speaking” verbs (and often continue with them), with a variant phrase  beginning verse 5, and the last two verses (13–14) echo these verbs. These last two  verses treat the unhitching of the stones, their task completed, and the last pāda of  verse 14 rather poignantly not only releases them but de-animatizes them: they are  now perceived as just stones.
