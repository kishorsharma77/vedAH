The publ. tr. has “All have a share in divinity and its name.” I would now replace this with “… your divinity and your name.” As I argue in the art. cit., the “all” literally share the name Vaiśvānara.

The contrast between the joint enterprise of those unified by the Vaiśvānara fire, expressed by bhájanta víśve, and the separate actions of each of the members, expressed by évaiḥ, is the theme of this verse as well as vs. 8.
