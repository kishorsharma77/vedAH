Ge (see also Gr) takes āmā́su as modifying vakṣáṇāsu (“in die rohen Bäuche”), which is certainly possible grammatically. However, in other instantiation of this paradox it is the cows that are raw. (See an ex. below.) Hence the publ. tr., with first the cows (a), then the udders of the cows (b) as the depoisitory of the cooked milk.

Ge follows Gr in taking the fem. of jágat- (here loc. pl. jágatīṣu) as simply designating a female creature (“in … weiblichen Tieren”), but esp. in this context, in which the milk is held firm despite not being tied, the fact that the cows are in motion seems relevant. Cf. another phrasing of the same image in III.30.14 āmā́pakváṃ carati bíbhratī gaúḥ “Herself raw, the cow roams about carrying the cooked (milk),” where carati seems to correspond semantically to jágatīṣu here.

The publ. tr. might be slightly altered to reflect the unaccented āsu in c: “within them, the dappled moving (cows).”
