The puzzle in this verse is what is happening to the cow (góḥ) -- which depends on what case the word is in and on the interpretation of the VP práti vartayaḥ … áśmānam. If the VP is taken as hostile (“turn the stone against X”), góḥ is difficult to fit in, since as a gen.-abl. it can’t easily be a target. See the standard tr., plus Hoffmann (Inj. 191), for various attempts to wrestle with this possibility.

However, the VP can instead mean “roll the stone back,” with góḥ an ablative “from the cow” and the action depicted a friendly and helpful one. I consider this to be a variant of the Vala myth, referring to the opening of the cave. The problem is that the Vala myth does not ordinarily intersect with the Śuṣṇa story, which occupies the 2nd hemistich, but, as indicated in the publ. intro., the two myths are woven together in this part of the hymn.

Another problem is the present tense pariyā́si of d, in a hymn otherwise couched in the mythological past. In conjunction with anantá- ‘endless’, I suggest that the present is used here to express a past continuative ‘kept Xing’.
