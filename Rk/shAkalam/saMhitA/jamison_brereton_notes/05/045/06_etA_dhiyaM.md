Unlike the first hortatory vs., this second one is not entirely tied to the hereand-now; rather it provides three separate historical/mythological models for the effective poetic vision (dhī́-) that we are aiming to create now (pāda a). The first model (b) appears to be a variant of the Vala myth so prominent in the rest of the hymn, but those in c and d are obscure.

In b the first question is the grammatical identity of yā́. It is generally taken as nom. sg. fem., but Old suggests that it might alternatively be a (short) instr. sg. fem.

In the former case the referent of yā́would be the dhī́- of pāda a, which would be the subj. of ṛṇuta and identified with the “mother of the cow” (mātā́… góḥ); in the latter it would be parallel to the two instr. sg. fem. yáyā opening c and d. I favor the second interpr.; although the former is not impossible, I find the syntactic parallelism a stronger argument, and yā́could owe its abbreviated form to being displaced from initial position by the preverb ápa. If the instr. interpr. is correct, this leaves the subj.

of ṛṇuta and referent of “mother of the cow” open. Old and Ge both consider it to be Uṣas. Again, this is not impossible, but I think it may be Saramā, whose finding of the cows is treated in vss. 7-8 -- though Dawn as “mother of cows” (gávām mātā́) is found in vs. 2 and is also a strong candidate.

Ge remarks apopos of pāda c “sonst unbekannte Sage” (see also Lü, p. 329), and it is likely that we will not get further than that. Ad VII.99.4 Old tentatively suggests that the name of a Dāsa, vṛṣaśiprá, that occurs in that passage might have something to do with our viśiśiprá-, but even if so (and it’s certainly possible), this is a deadend, since all we know of Vṛṣaśipra is that he’s a Dāsa and killed by Indra and Viṣṇu. Like the Maruts in 4d, the fleeting intrusion of Manu here is unexpected and unexplained.

Even more so the “wandering merchant” (vaṇíg vaṅkúḥ) of d. On vaṅkú- see comm. ad I.51.11 and, esp., I.114.4. Although the standard rendering is ‘flying’ (see, e.g., Ge, Schmidt), its derivation from √vañc ‘move crookedly, meander’ makes ‘meandering, wandering’ more likely. In I.114.4 it modifies kaví-. I suggest there that it refers to an itinerant poet, and merchants are at least as likely as poets to be itinerant, following a meandering course as they peddle their goods. But who this particular merchant is meant to be and how and why he needs a dhī́- to attain his pū́rīṣa- remain unclear. If I had Dumézilian tendencies, I might suggest a trifunctional interpr.: pāda b = 1st function, c = 2nd function, and d = 3rd function (at least the latter two might work -- 1st

-function b is a bit of a stretch). But even if this
interpr. were persuasive, it doesn’t explain what the material is doing in this hymn at this point.
