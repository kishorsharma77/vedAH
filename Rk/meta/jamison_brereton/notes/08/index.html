  <h2 id="viii1-indra">VIII.1 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii11">VIII.1.1</h3>
<p>In the publ. tr. I take ca in d as conjoining the two clauses found in c and d
(so apparently also Ge and explicitly Klein, DGRV I.103, 105). However, given that
the ca is somewhat wrongly positioned and that it reminds us of other ukthā́ca
passages, I now consider it possible that ukthā́ca is part of a truncated conjoined NP.
See disc. ad VIII.82.4.</p>
<h3 id="viii12">VIII.1.2</h3>
<p>This verse, couched in the acc. sg. masc., is entirely dependent on the
índram of 1c.
In b Ge (followed by, e.g., Scar 163) takes gā́m as a “(Kampf)stier”
terrorizing the communities. Although it is of course sometimes necessary to
interpret forms of gó- as masculine, the feminine “cow” predominates (esp. in
contrast to the bull of 1c and 2a), and the Kampfstier seems to me an invention of
contextual desperation. I interpret it instead as the first member of a decoupled
compound *go-ṣáh (like go-jít-), parallel to carṣani- in carṣani-ṣáh-. A similar
decoupling is found in the next pāda, and playing with analytic versus synthetic
expressions is found elsewhere in the RV (see, e.g., VII.19.3–4, V.44.6, 52.15). A
plural gā́s might have been desirable, but number is of course neutralized in 1st
compound members, and when decoupled, the default might be the singular.
In the compound ubhayaṃkarám ‘making both’, the 1st compound member
ubhaya- ‘both’ is further specified by two syntactically independent words
vidvéṣaṇam and saṃvánanā – a play reminiscent of the one proposed for the
preceding pāda. For the latter word, Old considers but seems to reject the possibility
that it represents saṃvánanam with contraction of -a- with following u- over the -m.
It sees best to accept the text we have and interpret saṃvánanā as neut. pl.,
contrasting with the singular of vidvéṣaṇam. Perhaps Indra favors unions over
divisions, and it would also be a clever reversal for ‘division’, which is inherently
plural, to be presented in the singular, while ‘union’, which is inherently singular, is
in the plural. It would also be possible to take saṃvánanā as an instr. singular of
accompaniment: “division by hate along with union by love.”</p>
<h3 id="viii13">VIII.1.3</h3>
<p>I follow Klein (I.58–59) in taking the ca as connecting áhā víśvā with idám
used in a temporal sense. We might have preferred the order *áhā ca víśvā in the 2nd
constituent. but compare I.130.2, 9 áhā víśveva, where the phrase also behaves as an
indissoluble unit before the particle iva.</p>
<h3 id="viii14">VIII.1.4</h3>
<p>Following Old I take both vipaścítaḥ and vípaḥ as nom. pl., rather than
taking the latter as a genitive sg. (with Ge et al.). The thought is that the poets and
their products that belong to and emanate from the competing sides – that of the
stranger and that of our peoples – keep crossing each other in their efforts to reach
and attract Indra. For a thorough discussion of the possibilities of this hemistich see
Old, who calls it a “Musterbeispiel für Vieldeutigkeit.” The intensive ví tartūryante
brilliantly captures the constant roiling motion of these competitive elements.
The abrupt imperative úpa kramasva seems to merit a slangy tr.
nédiṣṭham appears to be functioning proleptically: bring it here so that it will
be nearby.</p>
<h3 id="viii15">VIII.1.5</h3>
<p>This verse contains one of the two examples of śulká- in the RV. The word
later becomes specialized in the meaning ‘brideprice’, but clearly does not mean that
here.
On the famous root aor. opt. (trisyllabic) deyām, see Jamison 1999, with
discussion of some of the abundant sec. lit.</p>
<h3 id="viii16">VIII.1.6</h3>
<p>Pāda c contains a cute and tricky construction: a conjoined nominative
subject of a 2nd ps. dual verb, with one of the subjects gapped. That is, underlying
*tvám mātā́ca “you and a mother” is reduced to mātā́ca, with the other subject only
detectable in the verb chadayathaḥ and implied by the ca. Similar gapping with the
1st dual is found, e.g., in VII.88.3 ā́yád ruhā́va váruṇaś ca nā́vam “When we two, (I)
and Varuṇa, mounted the boat…,” VIII.69.7 úd yád … gṛhám índraś ca gánvahi
“when we two, (I) and Indra, go up to his house….” Both constructions are
somewhat reminiscent of the vā́yav índraś ca construction, though that does not
involve gapping.
The sentiment of the verse is likewise a bit tricky. In ab the poet dismisses
father and brother as providing no benefit, in contrast to Indra, who is “good for
goods” (cd), but Indra is equated (positively) with a mother, who would in this
society of course have little or no control over goods and giving (as opposed to the
father and brother).</p>
<h3 id="viii17">VIII.1.7</h3>
<p>On iyatha (rather than iyetha) see Kü (100), following Hoffmann 1976: 553
n. 3.
The verse contains several unexpressed presuppositions. The anxious
questions in pāda a are explained by the statement in b: we ask where Indra is
because we know his mind is in many places. With Ge I take álarṣi in c also as a
question, again explained by d: they have sung to you, so are you coming?
Pāda c contains a heavy, accentless vocative phrase: yudhma khajakṛt
puraṃdara, the last two of whose members contain object-governing compounds.
The long (12-syl.) third pāda of bṛhatī nicely accommodates such iterations.</p>
<h3 id="viii18">VIII.1.8</h3>
<p>The first hemistich reprises 7cd, with a close variant of 7d recast in the
imperative (8a), and one of the vocatives of 7c made into a predicated nominative
(8b). This compound (puraṃdaráḥ) is in turn transformed into an independent clause
(with lexical variation) in 8d: bhinát púraḥ. This process is reminiscent of the play
with synthetic and analytic means of expression in vs. 2.
The fem. pl. relative yā́bhiḥ has no possible antecedent anywhere in this verse
or nearby verses. The only possible fem. pl. referent is the ‘fortresses’ implicit in
puraṃdaráḥ, but this makes no sense. With Old and Ge I supply ‘songs’, suggested
by pl. gāyatrā́in 7d, although not directly connected thereto, because gāyatrá- is
neuter.
Hoffmann (1967: 237–38) takes bhinát as a parenthetical verse filler, with the
injunctive expressing a characteristic of Indra, parallel to vajrī́. Although he is
attempting to account for the fact that bhinát is injunctive and yā́sat is subjunctive
(and perhaps for the fact that sitting on the barhis and splitting fortresses can’t be
done at the same time), this explanation seems over-complex. bhinát is a rhyme form
to yā́sat, and the expected subjunctive bhinádat would be a good candidate for
haplology under these circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="viii110">VIII.1.10</h3>
<p>Most interpret gāyatrá-vepas- with a trans./caus. sense of vepas- (Gr ‘zu
Gesängen anregend’, Ge ‘die die Sänger beredt macht’, Scar [69] sim.), but neither
independently or in compounds does vépas- have this sense; it simply means
‘trembling excitation, excitement’. Moreover the usage of gāyatrá- nearby in this
hymn (7d, 8a) indicates that Indra (who is the referent of gāyatrá-vepasam, though in
the guise of a cow) is the recipient of the songs, not their inciter. Presumably his
pleasure in them will induce him to be a “good milker” by giving largesse to the
singers, but at least in this passage he does not seem to be giving inspiration to the
singers in the form of songs.
Trisyllabic án i
yām in c is problematic, distinguished from anyá- ‘other’ both
by accent and by trisyllabic reading. Nonetheless Ge (reluctantly, see his n.) tr. it as
if it belonged to that stem: “eine andere [zweite]…” Old by contrast derives it from
á-ni-ya- ‘nicht niedergehend, nicht (in Unglück) hineingeratend’. (I assume that he
meant the final portion to be analyzed as the root √i ‘go’, with thematic vowel, but
he doesn’t specify.) Both Gr and Scar (69) extend this semantically to ‘nicht
versiegend’ (not drying up), which pushes the limit in my view. Its only other
occurrence is in VIII.27.11, in a less diagnostic context but one that is at least
compatible with a bovine referent. My own analysis of this word is admittedly quite
shaky. I take it as a back formation of sorts from ánīka-‘forefront’ and meaning
&ldquo;belonging to the forefront, lead(-cow)'. Dawn is regularly called ánīka- and the
word is sometimes used of her cows (e.g., I.124.11 yuṅkté gávām aruṇā́nām ánīkam
“She yokes the forefront of the ruddy cows”). A couple of not very strong models
can be adduced: samanīká- ‘encounter’ / samanyà- ‘appropriate to the encounter’,
dṛ́śīka- ‘appearance’/ dṛ́ś
i
ya- ‘to be seen’. However, I am aware of the weakness of
this analysis, and only produce it because other analyses are equally weak; Old’s is
certainly thinkable, though not with the explicit extension to ‘not running dry’ made
by others.</p>
<h3 id="viii111">VIII.1.11</h3>
<p>Various semi-understood myths are alluded to here, with minimal (or no)
identification of the subjects of the three parallel injunctives (tudát, váhat, and tsárat).
I am inclined to take the subject of all three as Indra (who is clearly the subject of the
middle one), but see both Ge and Old for discussion of other possibilities.</p>
<h3 id="viii112">VIII.1.12</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., this verse poses serious problems of
interpretation. It is also found in the AV in a marriage hymn (AVŚ XIV.2.47), used
as an expiation when something is broken during the sacrifice, or anything on the
bridal car needs mending, or when a student’s staff is broken (see Whitney AV ad
loc.). The verse is extensively and illuminatingly discussed by Old, who summarizes
the first two pādas as indicating that (a) Indra heals without using any adhesive
material to bring together the damaged parts, and b) he does so before the weapon
(unmentioned but presumed by Old to be the cause of the damage) drills through to
the collarbones, or rather the rib cartilage. This scenario seems plausible, although it
rests on several assumptions not explicit in the text, and it is essentially followed by
Ge, Tichy (1995: 327, 338), and Scar. I would only mildly dispute taking the root
noun abhiśríṣ- in pāda a as a concrete noun, a sort of band-aid (ṛté cid abhiśríṣaḥ
“auch ohne Verband” Ge, Tichy, Scar; see also EWA II.670), a piece of equipment
that seems uncharacteristic of Indra. This ablative seems to me parallel to the
ablative in b, purā́&hellip; ātṛ́daḥ “before drilling through,” and this parallelism invites an
abstract verbal interpretation of ṛté … abhiśríṣaḥ “without clasping/taking hold.” The
point would be that Indra can heal from afar, without even touching the afflicted, and
can intervene before the damage is done. The root √śreṣ is primarily an Atharvan
word and is found elsewhere in the RV only in the horse sacrifice hymn, I.162.11.
Most similar to our passage is AVŚ III.9.2 aśreṣmā́ṇo adhārayan &ldquo;Without claspers
they held fast.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="viii113">VIII.1.13</h3>
<p>Both this verse and the next seem to rest on the unexpressed
presupposition that on our own we have a pretty poor impression of ourselves, but if
Indra will pay attention to us, we&rsquo;ll feel good about ourselves again. (Early lessons in
self-esteem!) It may be that the curious verse 12 that immediately precedes sets the
stage for these verses by depicting Indra as one who can set everything to rights. See
esp. the last pāda of 12.
On duróṣa- see EWA s.v. This rare and unclear word, appearing 3x in the RV
(IV.21.6 and IX.101.3 as well as here), must be compared with similarly unclear
Aves. dūraoša-, a standing epithet of Haoma in the Hom Yašt and also once in the
Gāthās (Y 32.14). In the RV it modifies Soma only in IX.101.3; here it qualifies “us”
and in IV.21.6 the Hotar, most likely Agni. The Avestan word has been variously
interpr. – but no more convincingly than its RVic counterpart. The tr. adopted here,
‘difficult to burn’, makes a connection with the Aves. forms more difficult because
dus- ‘bad, ill’ should not appear with -r in sandhi (see disc. in EWA), though
Humbach et al. (n. ad Y 32.14) upholds this analysis. This rendering is not altogether
a good fit in any of the RVic passages; nonetheless, the alternatives seem worse. In tr.
it so, I’m assuming a Vedic-internal folk etymology from an opaque inherited word;
the tr. therefore has no implications for the meaning of the Avestan word or for IIr.
etymology. Sāy’s interpr. of the word in two of the three passages falls squarely in
this realm: VIII.1.13 oṣitum anyair dagdham aśaktyā(ḥ), IX.101.3 … durdahaṃ
durvadhaṃ vā
VIII.1.14–17: Note the concentration of nominal forms of the root √stu ‘praise’ in
these verses: stómam 14d, 15a, sadhástutim 16a, úpastutiḥ 16c, suṣṭutím 16d. The
appearance of sómam in 17a signals a sort of ring-composition by variant, echoing
the two forms of stómam in successive pādas of 14 and 15.</p>
<h3 id="viii114">VIII.1.14</h3>
<p>Although the primary sense of d, “take delight in your praise,” is surely
that the poets will enjoy praising Indra, in the context of these two verses it
presumably also implies that they will take delight because their praise will put them
(back?) into Indra’s good graces and thereby improve their own view of themselves
and their chances of making good.</p>
<h3 id="viii115">VIII.1.15</h3>
<p>Again the uncertainty about whether Indra will pay attention to their praise
gives a slightly nervous air to the beginning of this verse. In the 2nd pāda the full form
of ‘our’ (asmā́kam) is fronted; a tr. better reflecting this emphasis and in harmony
with the poets’ anxieties about Indra’s attention would be “let it be our (soma-)drops
that invigorate Indra…” Cf. 3cd.</p>
<h3 id="viii116">VIII.1.16</h3>
<p>The phraseology of this verse echoes some previous ones: its opening ā́tv
àdyá is identical to 10a, and vāvā́tar- ‘favorite’ occurs in the RV only here and in 8b
(in the same position).</p>
<h3 id="viii117">VIII.1.17</h3>
<p>Because dhāvata in b is unaccented, it cannot be directly parallel with sótā
in pāda a, as, e.g., Ge takes it, because the hí of pāda a should then have domain over
b and induce accent on the verb. I take the hí clause as indicating the grounds or prior
action needed for the next clause, as so often when hí appears with the imperative
(see Brereton 2012). It is also possible that sótā is an injunctive, though clear impv.
sotā in 19b disfavors this interpretation.
On the īm enam doubling see Jamison 2002.
In c I take gavyā́as part of the frame, not the simile, because of the position of
iva. Contra Ge, who takes gavyā́vástrā as the simile: “[g]leichsam in
Milchgewänder…”
dhukṣan should be an injunctive to the sa-aorist found in ádhukṣat, etc., the
only reliably attested sigmatic aorist to √duh. It would be appealing to interpret it as
a subjunctive to an athematic s-aorist (as the pub tr. “will milk”and Ge’s “wollen …
herausmelken” suggest), but it should then have full-grade *dhokṣan.
On vakṣáṇā- ‘belly’ as a pl. tantum, see comm. ad X.27.16.</p>
<h3 id="viii119">VIII.1.19</h3>
<p>The second hemistich contains a slight reversal of expectations: śakrá- is a
standard epithet of Indra, who must be the subject of pīpayat (unless we read loc.
śakre, not nom. śakraḥ with Pp.). But we do not expect Indra to swell the soma drink
– if anything the reverse. (In fact, Gr suggests that śakrá- modifies soma in just this
instance.) I think we must take Indra as the indirect agent of the swelling of soma: by
his presence at the sacrifice he causes the sacrificers to press and mix the soma with
water and milk, thus swelling it. See Old on this verse.</p>
<h3 id="viii120">VIII.1.20</h3>
<p>gáldā- appears in the RV only here and its meaning and etymology are
entirely unclear. See EWA s.v. as well as detailed discussion by Old. In his study of
the word (AcOr 13 [1925], see ref. in EWA), Lüders suggests that it means ‘Strom,
Gerausche’; although most do not accept Lüders’ interpretation, it makes contextual
sense here, and a passage adduced by Old from MŚS I.7.2.18 ā mā viśantu indava ā
galdā dhamanīnām, where it is parallel to indu ‘drop’ and is the galdā(ḥ) of pipes
(dhamanīnām) also supports an interpretation in that general sphere. Note that the
fact that the word begins and ends with plain voiced stops makes it phonotactically
unlikely to be an inherited word, at least in the form we have it, and the -l- marks it
as “popular.”
The notion that “begging” by inferiors of superiors is a social requirement and
also a potential source of annoyance to the superior is found elsewhere in Vedic. See
Jamison 1996 (Narten Fs.): 191–99.</p>
<h3 id="viii121">VIII.1.21</h3>
<p>The first three pādas of this verse are couched in the acc. sg. masc. I take
them as continuing the last pāda of the previous verse, as objects of yāciṣat (to be
supplied from 20d). So also Tichy (195). By contrast, Ge, flg. Old, supplies
“(Preiset),” which is certainly possible but not generated from context. The root √yāc
takes a double acc.: “beg s.o. for s.th.” Here I assume that mádam of a is what is
begged for and ugrám of b qualifies the one begged, namely Indra, as an appositive
to ī́śānam ‘master’ in 20d. The referent of tarutā́ram ‘overcomer, triumphant one’ in
c is most likely Indra, but it is worth noting that máda- is the referent of tarutár- in
VIII.46.8–9.
Why we are begging for máda- ‘exhilaration’, which is a state of Indra’s, not
ours, is made clear by pāda d: when Indra is exhilarated, he gives to us.</p>
<h3 id="viii122">VIII.1.22</h3>
<p>śévāra- ‘treasury’ is a hapax, derived from haplologized *śéva-vāra-
‘having dear valuables’, a derivation found already in Gr (though with vara- as
suggested 2nd member; for reff. see KEWA s.v. śévaḥ). Note its juxtaposition with
vā́ryā ‘desirable things’ here.
I take pāda a as a nominal sentence, and supply rāsate ‘will grant’ in b, from c,
given their parallel datives. Ge takes ab as a single sentence and supplies “verwahrt”
(keeps), again possible but not generated from context.</p>
<h3 id="viii125">VIII.1.25</h3>
<p>I supply ‘yoked’ with ráthe hiraṇyáye, on the basis of the same phrase in
24b with yuktā́(ḥ), but it would be possible to follow Ge and take it as merely a
locational phrase: “[d]ich … im goldenen Wagen.”</p>
<h3 id="viii127">VIII.1.27</h3>
<p>abhí in b, in conjunction with ásti in a, invites us to read the lexeme abhí
√as ‘be dominant’ in b.
The second half of the verse returns to the anxieties about whether Indra will
come to our sacrifice found earlier in the hymn by a series of insistent assertions that
he will come. Alternatively these could be read as questions: “Will he come?” etc.</p>
<h3 id="viii128">VIII.1.28</h3>
<p>In c I read the injunctive ánu caraḥ twice, once as preterite and once with
future meaning, contrary to Ge, who only takes it as a modal: “Du mögest …
nachgehen” (followed by Klein II.121). The peculiar position of the ádha and the
presence of dvitā́suggest this double interpretation to me, though admittedly pādafinal ádha dvitā́does occur elsewhere without this syntactic effect (e.g., I.132.3,
VI.16.4).</p>
<h3 id="viii131">VIII.1.31</h3>
<p>Some lexical and syntactic problems here. First, though the most obvious
noun to construe with ā́… ruham ‘I mounted’ is the acc. áśvān ‘horses’, in fact
horses never get mounted in the RV, only chariots (including in the loc., VIII.22.9). I
therefore construe ráthe with the verb here and take the horses loosely with
śraddháyā.
The next question is the meaning of the adjective modifying the horses,
vánanvataḥ. Ge connects it with vána- ‘wood’ and tr. “die ans Holz gespannten
Rosse,” but, although there are undoubted occurrences of the stem vánanvant- that
do mean ‘wooden’, I doubt that this is one of them. Among other things in the
occurrence in nearby VIII.6.34 modifying matí- ‘thought’, ‘wooden’ is effectively
excluded. I instead connect it with √van ‘win’, whose various participles cross each
other so much that a blend of this sort would not be surprising. For further disc. see
VII.81.3.
The second hemistich opens with the conjunction utá, which is a problem for
any interpretation of this verse, since it is ordinarily a coordinating conjunction but
the first hemistich is a subordinate clause (note the final accented verb ruhám
conditioned by yád in a) and the second a main clause (unaccented verb ciketati).
Klein (I.451) is puzzled by the passage but suggests that if the chariot of the
subordinate clause is a gift and the valuable goods is another prospective gift, “utá is
thereby explained.” But his tr. of the verse clearly divides it into subordinate and
main clauses. I simply leave it unexplained.
Finally, what is the value of ciketati? Old, followed by Klein, suggests
supplying the patron as subject: “(then) will (the liberal one) take note (to give me)
also (some) of the desirable wealth, which is the herd of Yadu” (tr. Klein I.451),
taking the verb in the I/T meaning ‘perceives’. But this requires inventing a patron
(although it is true that one appears in the next verse) and, more problematic,
supplying a further verbal complement, not only “take note” but “to give me,” which
seems to me to be taking more liberties with the text that we should. I therefore
prefer to follow Ge in taking ciketati in its less common intransitive value, meaning
‘appears, stands out’ (see Ge’s notes for parallel passages, which interestingly are
also dānastutis), with the relative clause of pāda d as its subject.</p>
<h3 id="viii134">VIII.1.34</h3>
<p>Although Ge takes śáśvatī as a personal name, and indeed the name of the
poet’s wife, in this dānastuti context it’s far more likely that the woman in question is
part of the gift, and śáśvatī here can be seen as a semantic development of the literal
meaning of the stem śáśvant- ‘each and every, one after the other, ever and always’
can develop to ‘constant, reliable, always available/ready.’ The woman is “ever
ready” for sex, at least in the poet’s imagination. For a slightly different development
of *śaś(-vant-), in the comparative śáśīyas-, also applied to a woman, see V.61.6.</p>
<h2 id="viii2-indra">VIII.2 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii22">VIII.2.2</h3>
<p>This is an orphan verse, which cannot be construed grammatically with
either 1 or 3, though a mere yáḥ would allow it to be the rel. clause to 3, as the initial
tám of 3a suggests.</p>
<h3 id="viii23">VIII.2.3</h3>
<p>I take góbhiḥ twice, with both the frame and the simile. In the frame it is to
be construed with tám … śrīṇántaḥ “preparing it with cows’ milk,” but in the simile
yávaṃ ná “like barley” I take it as a passive variant of the common figure “as cows
enjoy a grainfield (yávasa-),” e.g., V.53.8 ráṇan gā́vo ná yávase.
In c Ge supplies “lade ich,” but I read akarma from b also in this pāda, in a
different idiom “make X to be at/in.” The usual idiom is ā́√kṛ ‘bring here’;
unfortunately there is no trace of ā́.</p>
<h3 id="viii25">VIII.2.5</h3>
<p>tṛprá- only here in the RV, though it appears later and may also be related
to tṛpála- (RV 2x), also used of soma (see EWA s.v.); ‘sharp’ is only a guess, though
shared with Ge, a characterization of soma usually expressed by tīvrá- (as in 10b).
In c ápa √spṛ is found only here in the RV; if it belongs to √spṛ ‘win’, it
might mean ‘win away’. Ge. tr. “abstossen” (repel). EWA (s.v. SPAR) suggests that it
belongs to a synchronically separate root ‘losmachen, befreien, in Sicherheit bringen’,
in which case ‘keep away’ would work.</p>
<h3 id="viii26">VIII.2.6</h3>
<p>A quite opaque verse. The underlying point, in the context of the preceding
verse, is that though our own preparations of soma may not be of the best, Indra will
still come to our sacrifice (vs. 5), even if other sacrificers aggressively pursue him
with (better-tasting) soma mixed with cows’ milk. The repetition of two words for
cow (góbhiḥ opening the verse and dhenúbhiḥ closing it) draws attention to the
notion and suggests that the other sacrificers have mixed their soma with milk (the
most desirable way to serve soma), while our soma was characterized in vs. 5 as
unmixed, badly mixed, or “sharp” (?).
Pāda b adds its own difficulties to the verse’s interpretation, esp. the rare and
disputed word vrā́-. In Jamison 2003 [HPS Fs.] I discuss this word and its contexts at
length, suggesting that it means ‘(female) chooser’ (that is, the bride at a svayaṃvara
“self-choice” wedding) and is a reduced form of *varā́-. This passage gave me pause,
however, and in that article I toyed with the possibility that it contains a different
word vrā́- or else that its meaning had become attenuated because it was moribund. I
now think that it is the same word vrā́- and that it does here compare the other
sacrificers to women chasing husbands, perhaps hinting at the unseemly nature of
this pursuit. I take mṛgám … mṛgáyante as a phrasal verb with a cognate accusative,
so meaning simply “go hunting.”
Note that the accent on abhitsáranti requires it to be part of the yád clause,
leaving the verse without a main clause and making its dependence on vs. 5 clear.</p>
<h3 id="viii27">VIII.2.7</h3>
<p>The three soma drinks might refer to the unsatisfactory types in vs. 5 or to
the soma at the three pressings, but most likely to the three types mentioned in vs. 9
(the final verse of the tṛca of which this is the first). We might think of this as a
species of “ritual repair”: the poor versions of soma in vs. 5 are adjusted slightly to
produce the properly prepared ones in this tṛca.
The referent of své in c is unclear. (Note in passing that if read as distracted
suvé [with HvN], its first syllable matches sutā́saḥ of b and sutapā́vnaḥ. However,
with Old I prefer to distract the final word to sutapā́vanaḥ; cf. somapā́van-, whose
oblique forms require distraction although they are written with –vn-.) If we assume
that své refers to the subject, then it must be soma’s dwelling, whatever that is (the
ritual ground?). The only other personage mentioned in the verse is Indra, but it is
unlikely to be his dwelling — pace Ge, who construes sutapā́vnaḥ with the loc.
phrase (“im eigenen Hause des Somatrinkers”). I take it as referring to the
unexpressed agent of sutā́saḥ santu “let them be pressed,” namely us.</p>
<h3 id="viii29">VIII.2.9</h3>
<p>There are successive gappings here: we need to supply asi with b, and asi +
ā́śīrtaḥ in c. I take all three clauses as 2nd person, though Ge makes b and c both 3rd
person.</p>
<h3 id="viii211">VIII.2.11</h3>
<p>It is a little odd to command Indra to undertake the sacrificial preparations
that are really our job. Presumably once again (see VIII.1.19) Indra is conceived of
as the indirect agent: by coming to our sacrifice he sets our preparations in motion,
and our impetus for this preparation is the knowledge that he has riches to distribute.</p>
<h3 id="viii212">VIII.2.12</h3>
<p>A peculiar ending to a celebration of soma, presumably describing some
of the potential side-effects of (over-)indulgence in soma.
With Ge (implicitly) I take ū́dhar as belonging not to ‘udder’, but to a
homonymous stem ‘cold’, with Avestan cognate (OA, YA aodar-). See EWA s.v.
ū́dhan-. The same ‘cold’ sense is found also in V.34.3 and as a pun in X.61.9. But
compare Old, who finds a complex way to rescue ‘udder’, though not one sufficently
plausible to me, anyway. See also disc. ad IX.107.20.</p>
<h3 id="viii213">VIII.2.13</h3>
<p>Given the parallelism with ab, we might expect to supply śrutáḥ in c.
However, prá makes some difficulties: no práśruta- is attested. However, prá śṛnve,
-ire has the meaning ‘is/are far-famed’.</p>
<h3 id="viii214">VIII.2.14</h3>
<p>As Ge (n.) points out, this is a subtle jab at Indra. If the god doesn’t
provide cows (and other wealth) to his praiser, then no one will pay attention to
either the praiser or, by implication, the praise he produces for the god.</p>
<h3 id="viii215">VIII.2.15</h3>
<p>Note the etymological and phonological figure śíkṣā śacīvaḥ śácībhiḥ. The
desire to have a pāda consisting of only these related words may account for the
absence of naḥ: śíkṣa- regularly takes a dative. Cf. the fuller expression in I.62.12
śíkṣā śacīvas táva naḥ śácībhiḥ. Of course naḥ can be easily supplied here from pāda
a.</p>
<h3 id="viii216">VIII.2.16</h3>
<p>This verse is a minor but neat example of syntactic modulation. The first
pāda is in the 1st plural, the third in the 3rd plural, while the middle one is ambiguous:
the plurals here can refer to vayám ‘we’ in pāda a or (coreferential with káṇvāḥ in c)
serve as subject of the 3rd plural jarante. So pāda b, by being without inherent
reference to grammatical person, allows &ldquo;modulation&rdquo; from 1st to 3rd person. I have
taken pāda a as a nominal sentence, and b as having third person ref. and belonging
with pāda c. But in fact the whole verse could be one sentence (as the tvā in pāda a
suggests, since it should be the obj./goal of jarante in Wackernagel&rsquo;s Law position)
with a harsh clash between vayám and jarante (which, notice, are the absolute first
and last words of the verse, so we can go along as an audience on the happy
assumption that the whole verse is in the 1st plural until the rude awakening of
jarante).
The bahuvrīhi tadídartha- is a nice example of phrasal univerbation, from tád
íd ártham “just this (is the) aim.”</p>
<h3 id="viii217">VIII.2.17</h3>
<p>In b I follow a suggestion of Re’s (EVP 13.98, ad IV.6.4) in interpreting
the hapax náviṣṭau as ná *viṣṭaú, with the only emendation the accenting of the
second word. Cf. I.92.3 árcanti nā́rīr apáso ná viṣṭíbhiḥ “They chant like women
busy with their labors.” Old explains it rather as a haplology of *návaviṣṭi- ‘new
labor’ (also Re’s 1st suggestion), and he is followed by Ge “bei der Neuheit des
Dichterwerkes,” taking apásaḥ as a gen. sg. But by its accent apásaḥ should mean
‘worker’, not ‘work’. Kü (p. 297) also follows Old, but, taking account of the accent,
tr. “beim neuen Wirken des Künstlers.” In the publ. tr. “at their labor” should be
preceded by an asterisk.</p>
<h3 id="viii218">VIII.2.18</h3>
<p>pramā́da- in c is a hapax, but clearly derived from √mad. I do not
understand where Ge gets “… gehen sie auf Reisen.” Old, commenting on Ge’s same
gloss in his Gloss., says “… glaube ich nicht.”</p>
<h3 id="viii219">VIII.2.19</h3>
<p>Hoffmann (1967: 87) notes of mā́hṛṇīthāḥ that the prohibitive contains a
present injunctive, and he interprets it, plausibly, as “lass ab von deinen Groll…”
rather than simply “don’t be angry.” However, recent work by IH (presented at AOS
March 2017) has argued strenuously, and in my view successfully, against
Hoffmann’s claim that mā́clauses with pres. injunc. are inhibitive, not prohibitive,
showing that pres. injunc. verb are found in mā́clauses only when the default (root)
aor. injunc. is not available. Note that √hṛ ‘be angry’ only makes pres. forms. The
context then must determine whether the form is inhibitive or preventive &ndash; in
particular, the simile “like a great man with a young wife,” the interpretation of
which will be severely affected by interference from our contemporary assumptions
about such a situation and by our lack of knowledge about the corresponding
assumptions in ancient India. If we assume on the basis of popular Western
depictions that young wives have many ways of annoying their old husbands
(profligate spending, flirting with younger men, etc.), but also have many wiles to
win back their husbands’ favor, then an inhibitive would work.</p>
<h3 id="viii220">VIII.2.20</h3>
<p>The opening mó ṣú matches ó ṣú of 19a.
On first glance this verse appears to contain a mā́prohibitive with a
subjunctive karat (so tr. Ge), which would be grammatically quite anomalous.
Hoffmann (1967: 92) claims that in the Sprachgefühl karat is an injunctive, but this
seems extremely unlikely to me because the root aor. of √kr̥is one of the best
attested of such formations, and though the stem kára- is well established, there is no
evidence that it is not interpreted as a subjunctive. There&rsquo;s no augmented ákara- for
example, and no thematic part. *kárant- or *káramāṇa-. I therefore take pāda a as an
independent clause, with gapped prohibitive copula (“don’t be”) with mā́. Since the
root √as doesn&rsquo;t form injunctives (or an aorist), there is in fact no way to make a
prohibitive copular sentence in any other way.
As noted in the intro., I think this may be a reference to the instituting of the
Third Pressing, which happens in the evening. The point may be that sacrificers who
fail to have a Third Pressing risk losing the presence of a disgruntled Indra to those
who do.
I do not entirely understand the social relations depicted in c. Ordinarily, in
patrilocal marriage the son-in-law would be at a distance anyway; that is, the wife
would be living with her husband’s family. Is this a reference to an in-comer, a
husband who lives with his wife’s family because he&rsquo;s too poor and who then makes
it worse by distancing himself — or to the return of a bride because the husband was
too feckless? Or is this similar to the situation in the Gambler’s Lament (X.34),
where the husband loses his wife because of his gambling or other economically
ruinous activities?
In d “down on his luck” translates aśrīrá-, which phonologically resembles
the characteristic offering of the Third Pressing, the ā́śir- ‘milk-mixture’. It thus
indirectly hints at the Third Pressing theme.</p>

<p>nā́yám is a famous crux. See esp. Thieme (1949) and more recently
Jamison 2013 (Fs. Hock), both with discussion of previous literature. After my
recent reconsideration of the evidence I would now eliminate “to the landing site,”
since I now think the underlying expression is *nā́ayám “(just) this man here,”
which lost its transparency and came to mean “on one’s own” and could be used for
any person, not just the 3rd.
VIII.2.29–30: Verse 29 consists of a relative clause (beginning stútaś ca yā́ḥ)
conjoined with the relative clause of 30 (beginning with parallel gíraś ca yā́ḥ), but
the rest of verse 30 causes some syntactic problems. The main clause appears to
consist of the end of 30b: túbhyaṃ tā́ni, but pāda c contains an accented verb dadhiré,
which appears to continue the interrupted relative clause beginning in pāda a. The
result is what looks like an embedded main clause, a syntactic anomaly. I am not
happy with this syntactic arrangement, but if we read dadhiré, there seems no way to
escape it. As Ge points out in his n., the Indian Pp. and Max Müller’s 1877 edition
read the verb without accent, but as Ge says, “dadhiré ist doch wohl die richtige
Lesung.”</p>
<h3 id="viii231">VIII.2.31</h3>
<p>Following EWA (s.v.) I take tuvikūrmí- to √cari
, not √kṛ as Gr, Ge do.
See disc. ad III.30.3.</p>
<h3 id="viii233">VIII.2.33</h3>
<p>Ge takes Indra as the referent of c with maghónaḥ acc. pl. referring to
human benefactors (“Wenn er berauscht ist, so tut er es den freigebigen Herren
gleich”). However, mandín- usually describes soma (although it does modify Indra in
I.9.2, 101.1, and X.96.6), and the only occurrence of mándiṣṭha- in the RV is found
in this hymn and also modifies soma: VIII.2.9 mándiṣṭhaḥ śū́rasya &ldquo;most
invigorating for the champion,&rdquo; with a dependent genitive, which is how I take
maghónaḥ here. I therefore, somewhat reluctantly take the subject to be soma, who is
accompanying (ánu) Indra, who already contains the multitudes listed in pāda a.
However, the appearance of pl. maghónām in the next verse (34c), where it refers to
humans who receive Indra’s largesse, gives me pause, and it is quite possible that
Ge’s interpretation is correct.</p>
<h3 id="viii236">VIII.2.36</h3>
<p>In the first pāda the grammatically unparallel vípro árvadbhiḥ express the
two complementary areas in which Indra is the winner. So also Ge; see his extensive
note.</p>

<p>On apparent impv. yájadhva see Old, though I don’t think the last word

<h3 id="viii238">VIII.2.38</h3>
<p>The formation of the hapax purutmā́nam is not entirely clear. With Gr,
AIG III.267 (and implicitly Ge), it presumably contains the truncated (ā)tmán- stem
in one way or another, but I am dubious about the meaning generally assigned to it
(Gr ‘lebenreich’, Ge ‘langlebig’), since tmán- almost always means ‘self’ not ‘life,
lifebreath’, and puru- ‘much, many’ doesn’t seem the most likely way to characterize
length of life anyway. I think it possible that it was influenced by expressions like
purú tmánā (I.142.10) ‘abundant in itself’, though it is not a straight univerbation. It
is also worth noting the long vowel in -tmā́nam, given that the only acc. sg. to tmánis short-vowel tmánam (I.63.8), though I don’t know what to make of this.</p>
<h3 id="viii239">VIII.2.39</h3>
<p>Ge’s tr. with added “(fand)” (see also his n. and Hoffmann 1967:137)
implies that this is a reference to the beginning of the Vala myth, in which the cows
are stolen and leave no traces, so that Indra must find them before he gives them
away. This interpretation makes sense of the otherwise opaque ṛté cid … padébhyaḥ,
but it seems to require a lot of added machinery. I do not have an alternative
interpretation, however.</p>
<h3 id="viii240">VIII.2.40</h3>
<p>This verse as it stands poses a number of problems, but some of them
disappear if, following Ge’s earlier Komm., adopted also by Old, and reflected in
Ge’s tr., the sequence yánn áyaḥ (per Pp.) is read yán náyaḥ, which requires no
change in the Saṃhitā text. This produces a subordinating conjunction (yád out of
sandhi), which in turn accounts for the accented verb (náyaḥ) and allows the whole
verse to be read as a single dependent clause (in my interpretation: Ge supplies the
verb “… hast du … erhört” for pādas ab, while Old suggests rather “du hast …
gesegnet”). Although my interpretation has the yád uncomfortably late in its clause,
after two heavy constituents (violating Hale’s old observation that only one
constituent can precede the yá-form), it avoids supplying a verb out of nowhere for
the first part of the verse, and I take the acc. phrase of ab as an almost extrasentential topicalized NP, so positioned to get the name and attributes of the poet up
front.
With Old and Ge I take abhí with náyaḥ, but unlike them don’t supply
‘heaven’ as the goal (on the basis of AV XII.3.16, 17). In the RV the lexeme abhí
√nī can take as goal vásu ‘goods’ (VI.53.2) or vásyaḥ ‘better state’ (VI.61.14,
I.31.18), and since this verse inaugurates the dānastuti, goods would be at issue.
As noted in the intro., there are various tales or tale fragments in Vedic prose
(see esp. JB III.233-35. also ŚB III.3.4.18) linking Indra as ram and Medhātithi, but
to my mind they are later and not particularly successful rationalizations of this
obscure verse.</p>
<h3 id="viii241">VIII.2.41</h3>
<p>As noted in the intro., one unfortunate consequence of taking all of vs. 40
as a single subordinate clause is that the 2nd ps. referent in the subordinate clause of
40 is Indra, while in the main clause here it is Vibhindu, the poet’s patron. As I
suggested in the intro., this may be a ploy to superimpose Indra’s divine generosity
on the human patron by implicitly identifying them. Vs. 21 in the next hymn (VIII.3),
also in the dānastuti, supports this hypothesis, since there Indra and the Maruts and
the human patron Pakasthāma Kaurayāṇa serve as undifferentiated subjects of the
verb ‘gave’ (dúḥ).</p>
<h3 id="viii242">VIII.2.42</h3>
<p>Although Ge declines to tr. mākī́, the interpretation of this word as a -kasuffixed form of the 1st ps. possessive pronoun, accepted by Old (see also Scar 519),
not only fits the context but would exemplify the tendency to use -ka-suffixed forms
in slangy, low-register contexts such as dānastutis. For disc. see Jamison 2009, also
2008.</p>
<h2 id="viii3-indra">VIII.3 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii32">VIII.3.2</h3>
<p>I am not sure why the “future imperative” avatāt is used in pāda c. Its use
implies that Indra should, first, not lay us low and, then, actually help us. This is
possible but not compellingly required by the sense.</p>
<h3 id="viii34">VIII.3.4</h3>
<p>In pāda a note sahás(ram) … sáhas(kṛtaḥ).
In c “(When) realized” may push the English beyond the Sanskrit satyáḥ só,
but the word order may weakly support this rendering. As often with satyá-, the
meaning is ‘real, really present’.</p>
<h3 id="viii36">VIII.3.6</h3>
<p>Pāda-final śávaḥ here is often considered to stand for instr. śávasā (see Old
for previous lit., Ge’s tr. and n., and most recently Hale [Fs. Melchert], who takes it
as an archaic zero-grade s-stem instr., with loss of laryngeal in pause; see comm. ad
VIII.39.2). However, as Old points out, an accusative reading is perfectly possible.
The presence of the same pāda-final nom.-acc. form nearby (4c, 8a, 10b) supports an
accusative interpretation here.</p>
<h3 id="viii37">VIII.3.7</h3>
<p>The pūrvá- in pūrvápītaye ushers in a set of verses with pūrva- forms (7d,
8d, 9b, 11d).
VIII.3.9–10: Although Ge takes the second hemistich as dependent on the first,
because of the parallel yénā clause opening vs. 10, I prefer to take 9cd and 10a as
dependent on 10b, with the yénā’s of 9c, 9d, and 10a all referring to śávaḥ in 10b.
But this sequence can also be seen as a type of modulation: the hearer is invited to
assume that the yénā’s of 9c and 9d have 9b bráhma as their antecedent, but the
opening of the next verse can cause reanalysis and a refocusing on śávaḥ in 10b.
In 9c a verb needs to be supplied. Although the sentiment seems to be
essentially identical to 9d (“you helped X”), the root √av ‘help’ does not take a
dative recipient. I therefore supply a form of √as or √bhū with the meaning “be there
for…” Ge rather “zu Hilfe kamst.”</p>
<h3 id="viii310">VIII.3.10</h3>
<p>For vṛ́ṣṇi and the phrase vṛ́ṣṇi te śávaḥ see disc. ad VIII.96.19.
Thieme (KZ 92: 46) rejects the usual interpr. of kṣonī́ḥ as nom. sg., on the
grounds that the nom. sg. is attested as kṣoṇī́in I.180.5 and that kṣoṇī́ḥ is otherwise
nom. or acc. pl. However, this requires him to interpr. it as an acc. pl. of Inhalts or
result with a passive verb: “dem (d.h.: wenn ihm) Gebrüll (aufrüttelndes
Kampfgechrei) hinterhergeschreien worden ist.” The syntactic complications of this
interpr. seem to me to outweigh the drawbacks of assuming that the poorly attested
stem kṣoṇī́- could generate a nom. sg. in -ī́s, esp. since its suffixal accent matches
that of vṛkī́-type nouns.</p>
<h3 id="viii311">VIII.3.11</h3>
<p>Rather than construing vā́jāya directly with śagdhí, as Ge does (“Tu uns,
was du kannst zum Siegerpreis…”), I interpret it as the object of the participle
síṣāsate, attracted into the dative in the fashion of datival phrases like vṛtrā́ya
hántave (e.g., III.37.5–6). For the VP see VIII.103.11 vā́jaṃ síṣāsataḥ. However, 12d
śagdhí stómāya may support Ge’s interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="viii312">VIII.3.12</h3>
<p>Ge’s interpretation of ab (“Tu uns, was du kannst, für diesen, der [den
Preis] der Dichtung gewinnen möchte, da du ja dem Paura beigestanden hast”) is
syntactically quite troublesome, in that it not only involves an embedded relative
(rare to non-existent in the RV) yád … ā́vitha, but one that splits up a close
constituent asyá &hellip; síṣāsataḥ. Old, by contrast, takes dhíyaḥ as object of ā́vitha
parallel to paurám and cites abundant parallels for √av + dhíyam, -aḥ. This allows
the yád clause to be normally positioned, although I still find the position of the asyá
unusual. I also supply a presential form of √av to govern dhíyaḥ, since the aid to the
striver’s insights seems to be a matter of current concern.
Unlike Ge I do not take svàrṇaram as a fourth client of Indra’s, but as an
epithet of the final name in a classic Behagel’s Law construction. In the next hymn
(VIII.4.2) mentioning Ruśama, Śyāvaka, and Kr̥pa there is no Svarṇara. I also take it
as an epithet in VIII.12.2, but as a PN in VIII.6.39.</p>
<h3 id="viii313">VIII.3.13</h3>
<p>It is generally, and reasonably, accepted (e.g., Gr, Old, EWA s.v. atasī́-)
that the hapax atasī́nām belongs with atasā́yya-, attested twice, so its meaning
depends on our interpretation of the latter – generally held to mean ‘to be
called/praised’. However, I take atasā́yya as a negated gerundive to √taṃs ‘shake’
(see I.63.6), and so atasī́- should mean ‘unshakeable, unshaking, firm’. In context
here, I assume that it refers to the stable, fixed elements of the cosmic world and the
standard subjects of poetry. This may implicitly contrast with návyaḥ ‘anew’,
sketching the usual tension between the poet’s desire to produce a new song and the
fact that his topics are preordained.
This category of possible atasī́poetic topics is then exemplified by the sun in
pāda d — a subject that, despite its greatness, does not match the greatness of Indra.
This interpretation of cd follows Old; Ge switches the objects of participle and main
verb, taking svàr with ānaśuḥ and mahimā́nam with gṛṇántaḥ: “Denn noch nicht
haben die, welchen seine indrische Grösse besingen, die Sonne erreicht.” Although
word order is hardly a reliable guide to RVic interpretation, the adjacency of pādainitial svàr gṛṇántaḥ weakly favors the Old interpretation, which also makes more
sense.</p>
<h3 id="viii317">VIII.3.17</h3>
<p>Ge takes parāvátaḥ in b with the second hemistich (“aus der Ferne
komme…”), but the idiom √yuj + ablative (“yoke out of X,” that is, hitch up your
horses and come from…) is found elsewhere; cf. esp. I.48.7 eṣā́yukta parāvátaḥ,
sū́ryasyodáyanād ádhi “This one has hitched herself up from out of the distance,
from (the place of) the rising of the sun” (also I.115.4, V.87.4, VII.60.3, 75.4,
X.94.12, etc.).
On hí with the imperative, marking that clause as the causal basis for the
following imperative clause, see Brereton 2012.</p>
<h3 id="viii318">VIII.3.18</h3>
<p>Most assign vāvaśúḥ to √vaś ‘desire’ (e.g., Ge “diese deine Dichter …
verlangen…”; so also Gr, Lub), but I take it to √vāś ‘bellow’. Kü (477-80) allows
both possibilities, though he argues that the original affiliation of the pf. stem vāvaśwas to √vāś, though it may have become partially co-opted by √vaś by semantic
overlap. I have opted for √vāś because this hymn contains a number of instances of
noise-making by poets or their substitutes: 3d abhí … anūṣata, 7c sám asvaran, 16d
asvaran, in addition to the usual verbs of singing and praising. Notice also the very
parallel 5cd &hellip; havāmahe &hellip; dhánasya sātáye, with a verb of calling and X sātáye.

<p>apā́is one of the few singular forms of the áp- ‘water’ stem.
On íriṇa- as ‘salt-pocket’, see EWA s.v., citing esp. Falk, Bruderschaft.
VIII contains two other occurrences of āpitvá-, both clearly derived from āpí-
‘friend’ and meaning ‘friendship’ (VIII.20.22, 21.13), but the presence of the
temporal designation prapitvá- here suggests a similar temporal analysis, ā-pitvá-. It
is surely a pun, as indicated in the publ. tr.</p>
<h3 id="viii44">VIII.4.4</h3>
<p>Pāda c refers to Indra’s stealing of his father Tvaṣṭar’s soma right after birth
— the drinking of which made him immediately strong. See III.48.4, etc.</p>
<h3 id="viii45">VIII.4.5</h3>
<p>The image of warriors holding themselves down “like trees” belongs more
to the Maruts’ rhetorical realm, where all natural phenomena bend before their storm
(see nearby VIII.7.34). Vs. 10c below contains another image fully intelligible only
in a Marut context.</p>
<h3 id="viii46">VIII.4.6</h3>
<p>The subject shifts without overt signaling from Indra to the man who
ritually serves Indra. Indra himself features in the verse as the yavīyudh- ‘everbattling’ one, who is worth a thousand others.
prāvargá- is found in the RV only here, but cannot be separated from
suprāvargám (which I tr. ‘well in advance’) in VIII.22.18 suprāvargáṃ suvī́ryam (cf.
our prāvargám … suvī́rye). There is also dāsá-pravarga- in I.92.8, which I tr. ‘with
alien-slaves as its forelock’. The prā- … kṛṇute also reminds us of vs. 5a prá cakre
‘put forward’. It is difficult to arrive at a consensus translation for these forms;
although all share the sense that the item in question is in front, it is difficult to assess
the contribution of the -vargá- element (much less what connection it might or might
not have with the Pravargya ritual). My “with a good twist” was an attempt to render
the root value of √vṛj (cf. suvṛktí-), but I am not now sure that it was a happy choice.</p>
<h3 id="viii47">VIII.4.7</h3>
<p>The logical connection between pādas c and d can be variously interpreted
(see Ge n.). In my view pāda c expresses the desire that Indra should in short order
perform a great deed that we can witness, rather than the usual bland notion that we
wish to celebrate his previous great deeds. Since Indra regularly aids Turvaśa and
Yadu (e.g., I.54.6), we may desire to see them (pāda d) because under those
circumstances we are likely to encounter Indra doing such deeds.</p>
<h3 id="viii48">VIII.4.8</h3>
<p>Pāda a contains one of the two occurrences of sphigī́- ‘hip’ in the RV (and
in fact anywhere). The other is in III.32.11 in a thematically similar passage, yád
anyáyā sphigyā̀kṣā́m ávasthāḥ “… when you wore the earth on the other hip.” (See
comm. there.) It is difficult not to assume that the same situation is being depicted in
this passage, and I therefore supply ‘earth’ here as well, esp. since a tr. without an
object makes little sense (e.g., Ge’s “Der Bulle deckte seine linke Seite,” without
further interpretation). In III.32.11 the image serves to give a comparison by which
to measure Indra’s vast size (the preceding pāda says “Heaven did not come close to
your greatness then”). Despite the truncated expression in our passage, I think the
same comparative impulse applies: Indra is so big that the whole earth fits on one of
his hips.
Pāda b is then thematically contrastive, though in a very indirect way. Even
though he is so vast and, by implication, too important to concern himself with the
likes of us, he gives freely and without feeling peevish towards the petty recipients of
his largesse. This sets the stage for our invitation to him in cd, describing the soma
mixed with milk (or rather, the reverse in this case: the milk mixed with the honey[ed
soma]) and then urging him to come.</p>
<h3 id="viii49">VIII.4.9</h3>
<p>This verse returns to the theme of vs. 6, the prosperity of a man who has
Indra on his side. The only difficult phrase is śvātrabhā́jā váyasā, which Ge takes as
referring to a particular age in the life of a man: “Er steht jederzeit in dem Alter, in
dem man die Vollkraft besitzt.” Although váyas- can refer to a vigorous time of life,
it generally means simply ‘vigor’ itself, and I also find it hard to make sacate + INSTR
mean “steht … in.” I think that it simply refers to the waxing prosperity and strength
of the man in question.</p>
<h3 id="viii410">VIII.4.10</h3>
<p>As noted in the intro., this verse forms a ring with vss. 3–4: 3a/10a the
buffalo at the waterhole, 4d/10d Indra’s assumption of power (… dadhiṣe sáhaḥ).
Pāda c with niméghamānaḥ ‘pissing down’ fits a Marut context better than an
Indraic one, and the other occurrence of this form (II.34.13) does in fact refer to the
Maruts and the rain they produce. See 5d above for another motif borrowed from a
Marut context. In this passage the product is presumably metaphorically the gifts that
Indra showers down.</p>
<h3 id="viii412">VIII.4.12</h3>
<p>The last pāda echoes 8d, with the same three abrupt imperatives in the
same order: éhi (prá) dravā píba, but in 12d the initial tásya needs to be construed
with the final imperative píba. On this as a quasi-serial-verb construction, see Yates
2014 [UCLA conf. vol.]. On the sandhi of tásya + éhi as tásyéhi (not *tásyaíhi), see
Old ad loc. and ad I.9.1.</p>
<h3 id="viii413">VIII.4.13</h3>
<p>On the basis of bradhnásya viṣṭápam (VIII.69.7, IX.113.10) I supply
viṣṭápam here as well. In these contexts bradhná- ‘coppery’ refers to soma (see Old).
For further disc. of the phrase see comm. ad VIII.69.7.</p>

<p>apásu is supposed to be the only RVic ex. of a loc. pl. to an s-stem in -asu

<h3 id="viii416">VIII.4.16</h3>
<p>Pāda d is, one way or another, an improper relative, in that there is no
referent for the yám in the main clause. Ge’s ‘wenn’ suggests that he takes yám as
standing for yád. I am assuming the ellipsis of a ca, for a “X and which Y”
construction.</p>
<h3 id="viii417">VIII.4.17</h3>
<p>See the intro. for speculation about the social situation here. Pajra Sāman
produces his own dānastuti in VIII.6.47, and our poet seems to be both denying any
interest in Pajra’s windfall and declaring Pajra’s duty to compose his own thanks for
it. See also Old’s extensive note on this passage.
The sequence vémi … ṛñjáse is reminiscent of VI.15.1 b … ṛñjase … / c véti.
In that passage because of the lack of accent ṛñjase must be a -se 1st sg. (and
therefore with a diff. subject from véti).On ṛñjase see comm. ad IV.8.1. In the
passage here the publ. tr. follows Gr’s interpr. of the form as an s-stem dat. inf. (so
also, e.g., Ge). However it is possible that it is also a -se 1st sg., but accented because
it opens a new clause: “I pursue you, Pūṣan; I aim (towards you).” On the other hand,
and probably decisively, the parallel pāda b vémi stótave also has a dat. inf. as
complement of vémi and so the infinitive reading should stand.</p>
<h3 id="viii418">VIII.4.18</h3>
<p>Here the singer seems to be implicitly separating his own (newly acquired)
cows from the alien ones of Pajra mentioned in 17 (nítyaṃ réknaḥ “our own legacy”
18b, áraṇaṃ hí tád “for that is alien” 17c) and driving them to a different pasture.
For the driving see vs. 20.</p>
<h3 id="viii419">VIII.4.19</h3>
<p>Here the desire expressed in 7d, to see Turvaśa (and Yadu), is realized in
imagination: the largesse of the king is so extensive that the poet feels he himself is
in company with the favored Turvaśa (and family). This returns us to the beginning
of the hymn (vss. 1–2), where Indra comes to various sacrificers, including Turvaśa
(1d).</p>
<h3 id="viii420">VIII.4.20</h3>
<p>There is no consensus on the meaning or etymology of the hapax
nírmajām; see EWA s.v. nírmaj-, with various reff. to KEWA; also Old ad loc. Scar
does not comment on it, though at least by shape (though not by accent) it appears to
be a root noun (presumed gen. pl. to a stem nírmaj-, though EWA allows possibility
of -majā, and AiG II.1.220 lists it as nírmajā without further comment). The tr.
‘flawless’ is adopted from Old. Though it may not be possible to determine what the
word means or where it comes from, as often it is possible to suggest a motive for its
presence in the passage: the phonological figure (nír-)majāmaje, nír.</p>
<h3 id="viii421">VIII.4.21</h3>
<p>The meaning of this verse is opaque to me. Perhaps the trees (and the rest
of the landscape features) are enhanced by the presence of an abundance of cattle,
indicating that the owner (or controller) of the land is prosperous. Kü (p. 413) tr.
essentially as I do, but (wisely) makes no comment.</p>
<h2 id="viii5-aśvins">VIII.5 Aśvins</h2>
<h3 id="viii51">VIII.5.1</h3>
<p>áśiśvitat is an isolated verbal form; the stem is otherwise not attested. Gr
identifies it as the “Aor. des Caus.,” and formally this is possible (type atitrasat
‘made terrified’ √tras). However, there is no trans./caus *śvetáyati to which it could
have been generated, and there is no possible direct object in this passage to justify a
trans./caus. reading. It is more likely a nonce intrans. redupl. aor. (type apaptat ‘flew’
√pat) created to substitute for the s-aor. aśvait (or the root aor. *aśvet on which
aśvait is built, acdg. to Narten), which would not fit the expected iambic cadence of
dimeter verse. The i root vocalism of √śvit would account for the redupl. vowel,
which would by chance coincide with the redupl. vowel expected for a causative
aorist: short i before the initial cluster.</p>
<h3 id="viii52">VIII.5.2</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take nṛvát as standing for nṛvátā, on the basis of VI.62.10 nṛvátā
ráthena, but there seems no reason to do so, since the adverbial neut. nṛvát is wellattested.</p>
<h3 id="viii53">VIII.5.3</h3>
<p>The Pp. analyses the sequence yáthohiṣe as yáthā ohiṣe, which would be, to
say the least, unusual sandhi (though see tásyéhi in VIII.3.12). Nonetheless, the
context favors a connection with the root √ūh ‘solemnly proclaim, etc.’ with pres.
óha- (in my opinion); cf. I.30.4 vácas tád &hellip; ohase “I solemnly proclaim this speech,”
with a 1st sg. -se form, as apparently also here. For this passage I assume a form ūhiṣe,
built to the presential perf. ūhé. This is also Kü’s solution (488–89), though he
assigns the form to √vāh ‘anerkennen’, which, acdg. to him, is at least synchronically
separate from √oh. Re and Lub. assign the form instead to √vah ‘convey’. For
further disc. cf. Old and Ge (n. 3c).
VIII.5.3–4: Both these vss., though not belonging to the same tṛca, most likely
contain 1st sg. -se forms.</p>
<h3 id="viii54">VIII.5.4</h3>
<p>Note the three compounds beginning with puru- in ab.
I emend the accented nom. káṇvāsaḥ to accentless *kaṇvāsaḥ, thus avoiding
the awk. “I shall praise (and also) the Kāṇvas (shall praise)” (so Re), or the necessity
of taking stuṣé as an infinitive. Nearby VIII.7.32 has #káṇvāsaḥ &hellip; /#stuṣé &hellip;, with a
pāda-init. accented voc. káṇvāsaḥ (cf. also VIII.2.38, and with nom. VIII.4.2,
VIII.6.31), and the accent here may have been acquired redactionally on these
models. By my interpr. “I” (the poet, who is himself a Kāṇva) announces to his
fellow Kāṇvas that he is invoking the Aśvins “for our help” (na ūtáye); the 1st pl.
enclitic naḥ encompasses the poet himself and those addressed in the voc.</p>
<h3 id="viii55">VIII.5.5</h3>
<p>Here and in the repeated pāda VIII.22.3d I think gántārā may, but need not,
be interpr. as a periphrastic future. There are enough possible exx. in the RV that
Macdonell’s statement (VGS, p. 177) that there are no certain examples in the
Saṃhitās needs reexamination.</p>
<h3 id="viii56">VIII.5.6</h3>
<p>With Ge and Re I (reluctantly) supply imperative ‘give’ in ab. It is barely
possibly (but I think unlikely) that ukṣatam in c is a pun, belonging to √ukṣ ‘sprinkle’
in c, but √vakṣ/ukṣ ‘increase’ in ab, with the meaning “increase good wisdom for the
pious man.” (Kiehnle 1979: 152 takes it to ‘increase’ in the whole vs.) Unfortunately
there are no certain exx. of the act. suffix-accented stem ukṣáti to √vakṣ ‘increase’
(though see med. part. ukṣámāṇa- and isolated root-accented part. úkṣant-), and even
if so, we would probably expect them to be intrans., at least on the basis of pf.
vavákṣa, etc., and the just cited pres. forms.
The hapax ávitāriṇī- is clearly derived from ví √tṝ, but its meaning is
variously rendered. Gr (Sāy) ‘enduring, lasting’, Ge “die nicht auf sich warten lässt”
(doesn’t keep (s.o.) waiting), on the basis of X.34.6. However, I take that passage in
the Gambler hymn to mean ‘run counter’ (adopting the tr. of Macdonell), or more
pointedly ‘doublecross’, the tr. I use here, though something like ‘thwart’ would
convey the sense of this idiom as well.</p>
<h3 id="viii58">VIII.5.8</h3>
<p>The acc. phrases tisráḥ parāvátaḥ, divó víśvāni rocanā́, and trī́m̐r aktū́n are
all accusatives of extent and presented as if they were parallel; the specification
‘three’ in the first and last underlines this supposed parallelism. But the first two
express extent of space and the third extent of time. A better tr. might be “you fly
around the three far distances (and? see below) all the luminous realms of heaven for
or during three nights. I do not know what “three nights” refers to: there is no
parallel locution elsewhere and the standard tr. do not comment. It may simply
reflect the common association of the Aśvins with triplets of various sorts. See esp.
I.34, which does have a roughly similar expression: I.34.7 tríḥ … divé-dive “Three
times, day after day …” As for the first two accusative phrases, the rocanā́(ni) are
regularly qualified as ‘three’, so “all the luminous realms” may be synonymous with
immediately preceding “the three far distances” (a phrase also found in I.34.7 and
VIII.32.22).</p>
<h3 id="viii59">VIII.5.9</h3>
<p>Re (explicitly) and Ge (implicitly) supply as the verb of ab voḷhám ‘convey’
from 10c. This is not impossible, and the duplication of some vocabulary (9a gómatīr
íṣa(ḥ): 10 gómantam … rayím … áśvāvatir íṣaḥ) may favor it. But the two verses
belong to different tṛcas, a fact that should disfavor such automatic filling in the
blanks. I in fact think that ab can be construed with c. That pāda asks the gods to
“unfasten” the paths (ví patháḥ … sitam), in other words, to make the way clear, for
winning (sātáye). The dat. infinitive sātáye frequently takes an accusative of what is
to be won (among many exx., cf., e.g., IX.88.2 purū́ṇi sātáye vásūni). I see no reason
why the accusatives of ab cannot be the object of this infinitive; with the acc. in b,
sātī́ḥ, we would have not only a cognate accusative construction, but one involving
two forms of the same stem. Alternatively the accusatives in ab could serve as
objects of ví … sitam, thus parallel to patháḥ. Cf. VIII.23.29, where both accusatives
found here are the objects of ápā vṛdhi ‘uncover’, semantically similar to ví … sitam:
VIII.23.29bc tváṃ no gómatīr íṣaḥ / mahó rāyáḥ sātím agne ápā vṛdhi “Uncover for
us refreshments consisting of cows and the winning of great wealth, o Agni.” Hence
in our passage “(Unfasten) refreshments and winnings; unfasten the paths for
winning.” See further disc. ad vs. 21 below, which lends additional support to the 2nd
alternative.
The epithet aharvíd- (4x, twice in this hymn) can contain either √vid ‘know’
or √vid ‘find’. Ge (and Gr) opt for the former, with Ge generalizing it to ‘Zeitkenner’.
Scar (480–81) considers either possible, though his tr. reflect the former. In I.2.2 and
I.156.4 I choose ‘know’, because both passages seem to involve knowledge of the
ritual day, but esp. in the latter I recognize the possibility of ‘find’. (See comm.
thereon.) By contrast the publ. tr. of this hymn has ‘find’ for both occurrences. I do
not feel strongly either way, but since this hymn begins with the Aśvins
accompanying Dawn (vss. 1–2) and the immediately preceding vs. (8) has a mention
of their traversing the nights, I mildly favor ‘find’, expressing the Aśvins’ advent in
the early morning, bringing the daylight with them. Note also svarvidā ‘finders of the
sun’ of the Aśvins in nearby VIII.8.7. This latter well-attested cmpd. seems
universally to be analysed as containing ‘find’, not ‘know’; cf. Scar 491–92.</p>
<h3 id="viii512">VIII.5.12</h3>
<p>The voc. vājinīvasū recurs here from 3a; in both verses it is immediately
preceded by a heavy dat. pronoun, the near-rhyming yuvā́bhyām and asmábhyam. Its
other two occurrences in this hymn (vss. 19, 30) are not so structured.
“Shelter that cannot be cheated (/deceived)” (see also VIII.85.5) is a striking
and somewhat opaque expression, since ádābhya- usually modifies animate beings
(generally gods) who aren’t gullible. I assume that the intention is shelter that can’t
be breached by trickery, vel sim., but the context of neither passage gives us any help.</p>
<h3 id="viii513">VIII.5.13</h3>
<p>The Pp. analyses yā́viṣṭam as yā́áviṣṭam, with the latter an injunc. -iṣ-aor.
to √av ‘help, favor’. Ge accepts this analysis and Re is sympathetic; however, Old
dismisses it, taking yā́viṣṭam rather to √yu ‘unite’, as the verbal counterpart (with
initial preverb ní) of the common noun niyút- ‘team’. This analysis is already found
in Gr and is vigorously defended by Narten (Sig. Aor. 212). One argument against
the Pp. interpr. is the fact that this would produce an unambiguous embedded relative
clause, and these are rare to non-existent in the RV.</p>
<h3 id="viii514">VIII.5.14</h3>
<p>The partitive gen. with pibatam consists of the phrase asyá … mádasya
cā́ruṇaḥ / mádhvo rātásya, rendered in the publ. tr. (sim. Ge) as “ of “this dear
exhilarating drink, of the honey bestowed,” which faithfully represents the hemistich
boundary. However, it also construes the adj. cā́ruṇaḥ with masc. mádasya, though
u-stem sg. oblique forms with interposed -n- should of course only be neut. This is in
fact the only certain ex. of such a masc. form given by Lanman (Noun inflec., 410).
There are several ways to avoid this undesirable morphological analysis. The least
attractive is to take máda- here as adjectival, but this exceptionally well-attested stem
is otherwise only a noun. The other two possibilities are better. On the one hand, the
rest of the gen. phrase includes the neut. noun mádhvaḥ, and cā́ruṇaḥ can be
construed with it: “of this exhilarating drink, of the dear honey …” The drawback is
that this artificially splits the gen. in b and reads part of it across the hemistich
boundary. Perhaps the best solution is suggested by the other four occurrences of
cā́ruṇaḥ, which always modifies amṛ́tasya ‘(drink) of immortality’, with the
nominalized amṛ́ta- neuter (IV.70.2, 4; 108.4; 100.4, always in the order amṛ́tasya
cā́ruṇaḥ, pāda-final as here). I suggest we read cā́ruṇaḥ here as representing that
phrase and tr. “of this exhilarating drink, of the dear (drink of immorality), of the
honey …”</p>
<h3 id="viii519">VIII.5.19</h3>
<p>I don’t really understand why the skin-bag of honey is set in the chariotrut. One might think of the English expression “grease the skids,” except that the
Aśvins are meant to drink out of it.</p>
<h3 id="viii520">VIII.5.20</h3>
<p>The referent of téna ‘with it’ is not clear. Although the verse sequence
might suggest the skin-bag of vs. 19, the chariot makes more sense, and in 30a,
where pāda a is repeated, it does seem to refer to the chariot or parts thereof.</p>
<h3 id="viii521">VIII.5.21</h3>
<p>This vs. is structured very like vs. 9, presenting some of the same syntactic
problems, but in a somewhat clearer fashion. The first two pādas, utá no divyā́íṣa,
utá síndhūm̐r aharvidā are identical to 9ab utá no gómatīr íṣa, utá sātī́r aharvidā,
save for the adj. modifying íṣaḥ in a and the acc. pl. found in b. Recall that Ge and
Re supply a verb (voḷhám) for ab, separating those pādas from c. Some support for
their position might be found in the larger context of vs. 21: the immediately
preceding pāda, 20c, contains váhatam with a variant íṣaḥ object (“fat,” not
“heavenly”). So it could be possible to read 21ab as a continuation of the VP in 20c,
giving support to Ge/Re, who supply a verb from the same root (√vah) to govern the
identically structured 9ab. But Ge happily takes ab as the obj. of the verb in 21c, ápa
… varṣathaḥ ‘you two will open up’ (s-aor. subjunctive to √vṛ ‘cover, obstruct’). As
was noted ad vs. 9, ápa √vṛ ‘uncover, open up’ is semantically very like ví √sā
‘unfasten’, and if refreshments can be the object of the first, this should also be
possible for the second.
varṣathaḥ is the only s-aor. form to √vṛ in all of Sanskrit. It is very possible
that it was created for this passage because the resulting syllable varṣ evokes the root
√vṛṣ ‘rain’, which would be appropriate for the liquids that are its objects in ab. Re
also remarks on this word play.</p>
<h3 id="viii522">VIII.5.22</h3>
<p>The subjunctive pátāt seems to be used in an unusual past prospective
sense in this mythological context. This may be an English problem, however. Since
the verb of the main clause is injunc. vidhat, this context is not necessarily preterital,
but “timeless,” and the subjunctive can therefore be expressing pure future modality.
The fact that the next verse is also mythological and contains an undoubted present
tense form daśasyathaḥ shows that mythological tense is fluid here. Re remarks (ad
vs. 23) that the indifference between present and preterite underlines the reflection of
the current human situation in the legendary material.</p>
<h3 id="viii524">VIII.5.24</h3>
<p>suśastíbhiḥ in pāda b is taken by Ge (also Gr) as modifying ūtíbhiḥ in pāda
a (“mit diesen löblichen Hilfen”; Ge takes návyasībhiḥ as adverbial “aufs neue”), but
this requires suśastí- to be adjectival. However, almost all occurrences of this stem &ndash;
and all seven other instr. &ndash; are nouns (‘good laud’)(and see nominal suṣṭutím ‘good
praise’, identically formed and nearly synonymous, in 30c below). Although in
Gāyatrī the b-pāda more regularly construes with the a-pāda, it is not out of the
question for it to go with c instead. In this case the instr. phrase of b goes well with c,
and it would only represent one constituent fronted before the subordinating yád.</p>
<h3 id="viii528">VIII.5.28</h3>
<p>This vs., like the almost identical IV.46.4, is syntactically somewhat
ragged: the beginning of pāda c, ā́hí sthā́thaḥ, should ideally be the beginning of the
clause, given the fronted preverb and the hí. But the object occupies all of ab (and the
end of c).</p>
<h3 id="viii529">VIII.5.29</h3>
<p>The syntactic disorder continues here. The main clause corresponding to
vs. 28 is vs. 30; this intermediate verse, the middle one of the tṛca, is an elaborate
nominal sentence couched entirely in the nominative and functions as an extensive
parenthesis further specifying the features of the chariot found in 28a (in the acc.).
On ubhā́cakrā́“both wheels,” with apparent neut. pl. for expected du cakré
see comm. ad X.10.8.
VII.5.31: The sense of this vs. is a little odd: it sounds as if the Aśvins on their
journey are snacking on the comestibles they are bringing to us and we will only get
the scraps. This is not the usual way to urge the gods to bring us things and makes
the Aśvins sound mingy. Perhaps the point is rather that there are so many (pūrvī́ḥ)
refreshments that there’s enough for everyone? Ge compares 19c, which does not
seem similar to me.</p>
<h3 id="viii533">VIII.5.33</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. “feathered birds, frothing at the mouth” is, to say the least,
inelegant and perhaps unintelligible. What I think is meant: the birds are compared to
horses (or the horses to birds); pruṣitápsavaḥ ‘frothing at the mouth’ qualifies the
underlying horses and indicates their speed. Cf. the overt horses in V.75.6 áśvāsaḥ
pruṣitápsavaḥ, VIII.87.5 áśvebhiḥ pruṣitápsubhiḥ (both Aśvin hymns)(latter
=VIII.13.11 [Indra]).</p>
<h3 id="viii534">VIII.5.34</h3>
<p>The hapax -gāyas- (a hapax) in ánugāyasam- is generally taken as a
primary s-stem to the diphthongal root √gā i̯
; see Whitney (Roots), AiG II.2.235,
EWA s.v. √GĀ2
. The contextual question is what is following what. For Ge the song
is sounding after/following the chariot (“Gesang schallt eurem Wagen nach”), but
most ánu- compounds have the structure “following X,” where X is the 2nd member
(e.g., ánu-patha- ‘following/along the path’; with diff. accent anu-kāmá-
‘following/according to desire’). I therefore think the chariot is following the song;
in other words, it is making its way to the ritual ground, drawn to the song being
sung there. Rather like the modern expression “follow the money.”
Pāda b seems to be a clear embedded relative clause &ndash; or else, at least as I
have punctuated it, a parenthesis.
The point of c seems to be that the wheel doesn’t knock against the chariot no
matter how fast it moves. Such knocking presumably would be a problem with
wheels that were not securely fastened to their axle and well balanced, so the Aśvin’s
chariot is, not surprisingly, well constructed.</p>
<h3 id="viii536">VIII.5.36</h3>
<p>With Sāy I take the wakeful wild beast to be soma. The obj. of √svad is
regularly an oblation, and in IX.105.1 its object, soma, is compared to a śíśu-, the
young of an animal or human.
vā in b cannot be the disjunctive ‘or’, as there is no disjunction possible. I take
it as the short form of iva ‘like’ (with lengthening), as Ge also seems to (on the
grounds of his “sozusagen”), marking the statement as an approximative. Old’s
comment is not entirely intelligible, but he seems rather to imply that vā expresses a
strong positive, and I therefore assume he thinks it’s a form of vaí, as do Re and
Klein (DGRV II.201–2).</p>
<h3 id="viii538">VIII.5.38</h3>
<p>There is much disagreement on what to supply with híraṇyasaṃdṛśaḥ and
indeed on whether it modifies rā́jñaḥ, interpreted as an acc. pl. (see Ge n. 38ab).
Since it seems unlikely that Kaśu gave the poet ten golden kings, even as figurines
(pace Old), it seems best to take rā́jñaḥ as gen. sg. and supply another desirable
golden item. Ge suggests garments, probably in part because of the hide-tanners?
Hoffmann (Inj. 229 n. 227) points out that gold(-bedecked) horses are mentioned
elsewhere in dānastutis, and I follow him in the publ. tr. However, given how
prominently gold figures in the description of chariots in this hymn (vss. 28–29, 35;
cf. also 11), ‘chariots’ might be a better choice.
The apparently contemptuous ‘hide-tanning’ (carmamnā́ḥ) must be a way of
indicating that, in comparison with Kaśu, all men hereabouts are no better than
tanners: ignoble, low, and engaged in dirty and polluting activity. But perhaps there’s
just a whiff of a suggestion that Kaśu has enough cows to furnish work for many
tanners &ndash; and therefore he should be more generous with these cows to his poet.</p>
<h3 id="viii539">VIII.5.39</h3>
<p>Like many dānastutis, this one seems to have a bit of sting in its praise.
The poet seems at first to be saying that the Cedis are so lavish in their giving that no
one else could follow them, but the 2nd half of the verse warns that all it would take
for another man to receive more praise than Kaśu is to give more. Although the mā́
prohibitive of ab is technically applied to other men (“let no one go …”), it’s really
an implicit challenge to Kaśu: he can only stop others from going on his path by
always giving the most.</p>
<h2 id="viii6-indra">VIII.6 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii61">VIII.6.1</h3>
<p>Displaced iva in b; we might expect *parjánya iva vṛṣṭimā́n, which would
also be metrically acceptable.</p>
<h3 id="viii62">VIII.6.2</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. takes pāda a as a nominal sentence with a predicated present
participle (píprataḥ), a fairly rare but not unprecedented construction. This has two
advantages: 1) it provides the verse with a main clause, 2) it avoids an anomalous
position for yád. However, since yád is also badly positioned in 3a and 8b, the second
observation may not be an argument. See remarks on 8 below.</p>
<h3 id="viii67">VIII.6.7</h3>
<p>The co-occurrence of a 1st pl. verb (abhí prá ṇonumaḥ) and nom. pl. imā́ḥ
… dhītáyaḥ causes some interpretational difficulties. Ge takes initial imā́ḥ as an
accusative plural object with the verb in pāda a (“Diese stimmen wir auf (dich) an”),
separating it from dhītáyaḥ in b, and interprets pādas bc together as a nominal clause.
This would rescue the word order, but an accusative with √nu is almost always the
goal of the roaring (and this exact phrase abhí prá nonumaḥ occurs a number of other
times), not the contents of the roar, as an obj. imā́ḥ would require (but see comm. on
I.6.6). I prefer to take the insights as identified with ourselves, both subjects of abhí
prá √nu. Old also suggests this identification, which is also found in vs. 8.
With vipā́m ágreṣu compare IX.99.1 vipā́m ágre. There are 43 occurrences of
sg. ágre and one of pl. ágreṣu; it seems unlikely that the number is significant here,
but simply used to supply an extra syllable.
In c Ge sees two similes, “like the flame of fire, (like) missiles,” but I think
the latter is not used as a comparison but an identification, just as in 3c the Kaṇvas
praises are called their “familial weapon” (jāmí … ā́yudham).
The simile marker ná is again misplaced; we would expect *agnér ná śocíḥ.</p>
<h3 id="viii68">VIII.6.8</h3>
<p>See comments on 7ab. The identification of the Kaṇvas and their dhītí is
quite clear here.
Another example of anomalously positioned yád, like 2b and 3a. In fact this
verse is structured entirely parallel to vs. 2: participial phrase in pāda a, prá yád
opening b followed by an injunctive in -anta and a nom. pl. subj -i-stem, c nom. pl.
referrring to poets followed by r̥tásya INSTR. phrase.
VIII.6.10–12: This tṛca is characterized by emphatic pronominals: initial ahám 10a,
10c, 11a; tvā́m 12a; máma 12c.</p>
<h3 id="viii610">VIII.6.10</h3>
<p>Ge explains the form of ajani as “attraction to the simile” (that is, 3rd ps.
instead of 1st ps.), but although obviously there is no 1st sg. passive aorist, if there
were to be, this is what it would be. More problematic is the logical connection of ab
with c. Ge thinks that the rebirth is “durch die Erleuchtung”; I assume he means that
the acquisition of knowledge and the resulting illumination caused the poet to be
reborn like the sun. But the sun is reborn every day, and the passing of knowledge
from father to son presumably happens once or a few times at most &ndash; although, if the
father is the son’s teacher, it might be a daily event.</p>
<h3 id="viii612">VIII.6.12</h3>
<p>The 2 occurrences of tuṣṭuvúḥ are standardly interpr. as preterital (“…
gepreisen haben”; see Ge and Kü [578], as well as the publ. tr.), but the context does
not impose this value, and the existence of an augmented plupf. átuṣṭavam (III.53.12)
with the same apparent meaning is disturbing. It is therefore possible that the verbs
here should be rendered “… who do not praise you … who do praise you.” The
existence of a pf. subj. in a nearby hymn, tuṣṭávat in VIII.8.16, also supports a
presential interpr. of this pf.
Pāda c contains an ellipsis: we expect an instr. here, as in VIII.1.18 ayā́
vardhasva tanvā̀girā́máma. The appropriate word can either be extracted from the
proleptic adj. súṣṭutaḥ “by my (praise) (so that you become) well praised” (as well as
the two forms of tuṣṭuvúḥ in ab) or, less likely, pratnéna mánmanā in 11a.</p>
<h3 id="viii613">VIII.6.13</h3>
<p>The accented aírayat in c raises questions. It is natural to interpret c as the
main clause, in which case we must assume a preverb ā́with an unaccented airayat
(see Old ad I.157.5). This is possible semantically and syntactically, but the Pp. does
not so analyze. Alternatively we could take all of vs. 13 as a subordinate clause
(“when his battle-fury smoked … (and) he sent …”) dependent on the main clause in
vs. 14, but this is not attractive, because it not only requires a switch from 3rd ps. to
2nd, but it also yokes together two otherwise independent myths.</p>
<h3 id="viii616">VIII.6.16</h3>
<p>Ge takes the footsteps or feet in c to be those of Indra’s horses, but on the
basis of I.32.8 tā́sām áhiḥ patsutaḥśī́r babhūva “The serpent came to be lying at the
feet of those (waters)” it should rather be the waters’ feet or footsteps. What these are
conceptually is not clear – perhaps deeper pools in the riverbeds? – but the parallel is
clear, and furthermore Indra’s horses take no part in the Vṛtra myth.</p>
<h3 id="viii618">VIII.6.18</h3>
<p>This verse is structured entirely parallel to vs. 12 and thus forms a small
ring that does not conform to the tṛca structure. On tuṣṭuvúḥ see comm. on vs. 12.</p>
<h3 id="viii619">VIII.6.19</h3>
<p>enā́m in c would be the only accented form of the ordinarily enclitic
pronominal stem ena-. See Old’s lengthy discussion of possibilities and previous
suggestions, although he does not reach a definite conclusion. My interpretation is
one that Old also seems to favor, that enā́m stands for the independent adverbial
instrumental enā́‘thus, in this way’ (an idea in different form that goes back to
Hopkins). As he points out, in the position before ṛ this would probably come out as
enā́m̐with anunāsika (Proleg. 470), and the redactional conversion of this to a “real”
m, esp. in a feminine context, would not be surprising. This adverb enā́is quite often,
though not invariably, pāda-initial. See esp. semantically parallel III.33.4 enā́vayám
páyasā pínvamānāḥ “So we (are) &ndash; swelling with milk …” For pipyúṣī- construed
with the genitive, see vs. 43b below, mádhor ghṛtásya pipyúṣīm.</p>
<h3 id="viii620">VIII.6.20</h3>
<p>The first problem in this verse is what to do with āsā́. Ge construes it with
prasvàḥ “Die … durch den Mund gebärend…,” and it would also be possible to take
it with ácakriran, as Old seems to imply, yielding “with their mouth they have made
you their child.” In either case this would require that ‘mouth’ is equivalent to the
products of mouth, namely noise, and that the bellowing of the cows, which stands
for the poets’ insights, is the instrumental cause. This is not impossible; indeed āsā́
sometimes refers to poetic speech. But I suggest instead that āsā́gárbha- is an idiom,
“infant-by-mouth,” that is, nursling, and that they are nurturing him directly.
Pāda c is puzzling, in part because it lacks both a verb and both parts of the
frame that should match the simile dhármeva sū́ryam. The verb is the easiest: the
preverb pári invites us to supply a form of √as ‘be’, in the standard idiom ‘surround,
envelop’. Ge’s reconstruction of the frame also seems the most likely: the subject
continues to be the cows/insights of vss. 19 and 20ab, the object ‘you’ [=Indra]. They
surround/envelop him in a nurturing, maternal manner. But the image in the simile is
very different: I do not know of other places in which the sun is surrounded or
enveloped in this fashion or what “supports” could be involved. If they are in fact the
“supports (of heaven),” as seems at least reasonable, it is possible to envision the sun
operating within a space defined by these supports – though, again, this does not
seem to be a RVic notion elsewhere. See Old for other, not particularly plausible,
scenarios. As indicated in the publ. intro., the translation given is very uncertain.</p>
<h3 id="viii622">VIII.6.22</h3>
<p>The position of the utá is abnormal, as it most naturally connects the two
nominatives práśastiḥ and yajñáḥ. See Klein DGRV I.434–45. The utá’s of 23b and
24a are correctly positioned.</p>
<h3 id="viii625">VIII.6.25</h3>
<p>The lexeme abhí √tan has the idiomatic meaning ‘stretch over’ and
therefore ‘extend control, dominate’. The image found in the simile (vrajám ná) is
found exactly in the parallel IX.108.6, where the vrajám is not in a simile. Elsewhere
(I.160.5, V.54.15) in the active it seems to mean &lsquo;stretch over&rsquo; (and therefore
dominate), and in a TS passage adduced by HO (III.4.6.2) Keith transl &lsquo;overpower&rsquo;,
which seems right in context.
Here the question is the referent of the object in the frame, sū́ra
upākácakṣasam “whose eye is near to the sun.” Ge supplies “Schatz” and thinks it
refers to gold, which is “near to the sun” in its color and also (hyperbolically) its
value. This is quite possible, but Agni is also found in just these expressions, e.g.,
IV.11.1 upāká ā́rocate sū́ryasya, and of course Agni is often identified as the sun.
The “gold” interpretation is probably correct, however, since the idea would be that
Indra controls goods and therefore can distribute them to us; what Indra’s control
over Agni would amount to is less clear. Note the independent gen. sūráḥ dependent
on the first member of the compound upāká-.
Because the verb of c is a subjunctive, which would clash with the preterital
perfect of ab, I take c with the following verse, whose present tense verbs are more
compatible with a subjunctive.
VIII.6.26–27: Vs. 26 (and if I am right, 25c) are both dependent on vs. 27 by my
reading.
VIII.6.28-30: The translation of this tṛca is superficially easy, but its interpretation is
difficult. Ge takes 28 as referring to soma, 29 to Indra (or 29ab to Indra and 29c to
soma; it’s not entirely clear), while Old emphatically rejects Ge and takes Indra as
the referent of both verses. Neither of them is entirely clear about the identity of the
plural subjects of 30, though both think that the verse is a reference to the dawn
and/or the dawn sacrifice.
I do not have a solution to these riddles, though I have some further
suggestions. But before presenting them, I should first point out how different the
style of this tṛca is from the rest of the hymn. There are no proper names in the verse,
either divine or human; the reference is only 3rd person; there is no specific ritual
vocabulary; the presentation is all descriptive, without even an implicit hint of the
hortatory; there are no similes, though the imagery is strikingly poetic. The whole
effect is almost allegorical, stripped of the busy specificity and the divine-human
give-and-take that characterize the rest of the hymn and reappear emphatically in the
next tṛca.
As often in the RV, I think some of the difficulties arise because two separate
referents are present. On the one hand, the location of the birthplace of the poet in 28
suggests, as Ge says, that soma is the subject. Soma, esp. the celestial soma often
encountered in Maṇḍala IX, could also be the subject of 29, looking down upon the
sea of the earthly soma. But in both verses poetic inspiration could also be the subject,
signaled by the two forms of √vip, vípraḥ in 28c, vipānáḥ in 29c, and by the
emphasis on seeing in 29 and 30. The progression from birth with insight (28c) to
quivering and stirring (29c) seems to describe first the germ of the poetic idea and
then its development. In 30 in a different image “they” (poets/sacrificers?) see “the
dawning light of the age-old semen” – a baffling phrase. The “milk of the age-old
semen” (páyaḥ pratnásya rétasaḥ) is found in III.31.10 in a Vala context, where it
may refer to the poetic products that help open the Vala cave. Here it may refer to the
even further development of the poetic insight, now fitted to a ritual context and
available to be “seen” by the ritualists who will make use of it. But all this is highly
speculative.</p>

<p>The publ. tr. of a and c may be difficult to parse in English: “after you
(roll)…” does not contain a temporal conjunction (“after”) followed by a subject +
verb, but rather a prepositional phrase (“after you,” that is, “following you”)
followed by a verb with postposed subject (“both worlds” / “the drops”).
The isolated verb form varti is, curiously, identified as an injunctive by Lub,
despite the apparent primary ending. Gr considers it a development of *vart-ti, which
is phonologically possible. I don’t have a firmly founded analysis of it, but I wonder,
since outside of the perfect, intransitive forms of √vṛt are medial, if this is actually a
“passive aorist,” which displays the expected strong form and -i ending, in which
case Lub’s inj. label would be correct.
In c svānā́saḥ is a pun: it can either be the nom. pl. m. of the mediopassive
participle of the root aorist to √su ‘press’ or nom. pl. m. to the thematic nominal
svāná- ‘sounding, sound’. See VIII.7.14, 17.</p>

<p>I give śaryaṇā́vati its literal meaning, deriving ultimately from śará-,

esp. in this context, is certainly possible.</p>

<h2 id="viii7-maruts">VIII.7 Maruts</h2>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn contains dense repetitions of
vocabulary and numerous phonetic echoes within and across verses. I have noted
some, but by no means all, below. Particularly common in the earlier part of the
hymn is the root √yā ‘drive’, in both verbal and nominal forms (2b, 4c [2x], 5a, 7b,
8b; also 14b, 23a, 26b, 28c, 29c).</p>
<h3 id="viii71">VIII.7.1</h3>
<p>triṣṭúbham íṣam “Triṣṭubh refreshment” causes some interpretational
difficulties. Although in RVic discourse there is no problem with an image that
involves refreshment conceived as metrical poetry, this hymn containing the phrase
in its opening phrase is in Gāyatrī meter, not Triṣṭubh. The same phrase recurs in</p>
<h3 id="viii691">VIII.69.1</h3>
<p>(Indra), a hymn that is also not in Triṣṭubh. Some remove the word here
entirely from the poetic sphere, as in Macdonell’s “threefold Soma draught.” Ge
believes that it can’t refer to the Triṣṭubh meter here, but that it must be a different
technical term in recitation. I do not think that the fact that these two hymns are not
in Triṣṭubh necessarily means that that meter can’t be referred to in this expression;
there are, after all, plenty of hymns to both the Maruts and Indra in Triṣṭubh, and the
verb governing the phrase is in the imperfect and therefore should refer to another
occasion. But following Ge’s lead, I think it possible that ‘(having?) threefold rhythm’
could refer to the Gāyatrī meter in which this hymn is composed, since Gāyatrī
consists of three pādas. Unfortunately this will not work for VIII.69, which is
composed in a variety of meters (incl. Gāyatrī, but only vss. 4–6); the verse in which
the phrase is found (VIII.69.1) is in Anuṣṭubh. I might emend the publ. tr. to
“refreshment in threefold rhythm.” For further on the compound see Scar (641–42),
who is somewhat indecisive about both the compound type and the sense.</p>
<h3 id="viii72">VIII.7.2</h3>
<p>ácidhvam in b (see also the identical pāda in 14b) should be read with
distracted final syllable (ácidhu
vam) in order to make up an 8-syllable pāda, but it
also should ideally have a heavy root syllable in order to avoid four consecutive light
syllables in the cadence. (Even though I do not believe that the cadences of dimeter
verse are as regulated as those in trimeter, iambic cadences do prevail, and four
shorts would be quite unusual.) Werba (183, flg. Seebold) suggests that the form
represents *ácid-dhu
vam to √cit, which seems very plausible (also for the identical
distracted form in I.87.2; in V.55.7 it does not require distraction and is therefore not
diagnostic). Gr assigns ácidhvam to √ci, which is nearly identical in meaning to √cit;
Lubotsky, curiously, puts it with √ci ‘pile’. The same type of cluster reduction is
found in the Marut hymn VIII.20.18 in vavṛdhu
vam, which likewise requires
distraction and a heavy root syllable and represents *vavṛd-dhu
vam from √vṛt ‘turn’.</p>
<h3 id="viii73">VIII.7.3</h3>
<p>I take úd īrayanta here as a reflexive transitive. It thus contrast with
intransitive úd … īrate in 7b.
See also comm. on vs. 10.
VIII.7.1–4: Note recycling of vocab. &ndash; íṣam 1, 3; párvata- 1, 2, 4; yā́mam 2, 4;
vip/vep 1, 4; vāyúbhiḥ 3, 4.</p>
<h3 id="viii74">VIII.7.4</h3>
<p>vápanti is also echoed by vepayanti in the next pāda, and the whole verse is
marked by alliteration: v’s, p’s, and r’s in vápanti … prá vepayanti párvatān; m’s in
marúto míham (both sets in ab), and y’s in c: yád yā́maṃ yā́nti vāyúbhiḥ.</p>
<h3 id="viii75">VIII.7.5</h3>
<p>The vs. consists only of a subordinate clause. I attach it to the preceding vs.,
since the yád clause of 4c seems parallel to the yád clause of 5 and yā́ma- recurs here.

<h3 id="viii78">VIII.7.8</h3>
<p>Exactly what atmospheric phenomenon is being described here is not clear.
Ge seems to think that it’s the Maruts who are traveling the path (pánthām … yā́tave
“dass sie ihre Bahn laufe”), though his n. 8b seems closer to my interpr. I suggest
that it is a post-storm image: the thunderclouds/Maruts part, releasing the sun’s ray
and allowing the sun to travel its usual path across the sky. The parting of the clouds
is expressed in c, the extending or spreading of the clouds that is accompanied by the
beams of the sun. Thieme (Fremd. 112) instead sees the Maruts releasing a ray as the
path for the sun to travel: the first ray of morning, which the sun follows. But the
Maruts are not dawn gods.
Pāda c is repeated as the final pāda of the hymn (36c).</p>
<h3 id="viii710">VIII.7.10</h3>
<p>The stem pṛ́śni- in the plural otherwise refers to “dappled cows” and is
marked (by pronouns and modifying adjectives) as feminine; see the immediate
preceding hymn VIII.6.19, as well as VIII.69.3, I.84.11. Here, however, there are no
diagnostically feminine forms syntactically associated with pṛ́śnayaḥ. This allows it
to refer both to (fem.) dappled cows and to the (masc.) Maruts, whose mother is
Pṛśni. Although the Maruts are regularly called “Rudras” after their father Rudra
(e.g., 12b), this is the only place in the RV where they are called “Pṛśnis” after their
mother. This verse reprises 3bc … pṛ́śnimātaraḥ / dhukṣánta pipyúśīm íṣam “They
whose mother is Prś̥ ni have milked out swelling refreshment,” with the bahuvrīhi
pṛ́śnimātaraḥ matched with pṛ́śnayaḥ here and dhukṣánta matching duduhré. The
pṛ́śnimātaraḥ in 3b all but ensures that we will take pṛ́śnayaḥ here as a referent to the
Maruts.
The referent of the three lakes they milk out as honey is the rain they produce.</p>
<h3 id="viii712">VIII.7.12</h3>
<p>Ge and Re (see his comm.) take sudānavo, rúdrā ṛbhukṣaṇaḥ as
predicative vocatives with the copula expression yūyáṃ hí ṣṭhā́“for you are …” This
seems unnecessary, since there is a fine nominative plural, prácetasaḥ, which can
serve as predicate. I take the utá to be connecting not the supposed predicative vocc.
with prácetasaḥ, but the two locc. dáme and máde. The predicative vocative analysis
is esp. unlikely because this is a repeated pāda (I.15.2, VI.51.15, VIII.83.9; there are
also further exx. of yūyám hí ṣṭhā́… as a pāda-opening), and only in I.15.2 is a
predicative voc. likely. (See Bloomfield, RR ad I.15.2; he considers it “plain
mechanical borrowing” there.)
The conjoined locc. “in our house and in exhilaration” may not seem to form
a natural semantic class, but note that they are anagrams of each other: dáme / máde,
and in a hymn so structured by phonetics, that would be enough.</p>
<h3 id="viii713">VIII.7.13</h3>
<p>I take madacyútam as having “active” meaning (‘arousing exhilaration’),
rather than passive. Scar (126) allows either for this stem, and Re takes it as passive
here. Since the passive form mádacyutam built with the past participle would fit the
same metrical slot, I think that the active sense must be meant.</p>
<h3 id="viii714">VIII.7.14</h3>
<p>I supply loc. upahvaré(ṣu) in a because ádhi doesn’t take the genitive (so
can’t be directly construed with girīṇā́m as Ge does), on the basis of the immediately
preceding hymn VIII.6.28 upahvaré girīṇā́m and the Marut hymn I.87.2 upahvaréṣu
yád ácidhvaṃ yayím, whose phraseology is very close to this.
I do not entirely understand what iva is doing here. Perhaps their wandering
in the distant parts of the mountains is implicitly compared to their journey here.
As in VIII.6.38 (q.v) I take svāná- as a pun, both a passively used root aor.
mediopassive participle to √su ‘press’ (‘being pressed’), which is eminently
appropriate for drops, and a thematic adj. to √svan ‘sound’. Although the latter may
seem less characteristic of drops, see 16a drapsā́iva … dhámanti “like droplets they
blow their blast,” as well as 17a, where svāná- seems to encapsulate the same pun.</p>
<h3 id="viii715">VIII.7.15</h3>
<p>The problem in this verse is the referent and syntactic construction of gen.
sg. etā́vataḥ … ádābhyasya (assuming that the two are to be construed together).
Most take the phrase as obj., one way or another, of bhikṣeta. Ge takes it as a
separate obj. of bhikṣeta, parallel to sumnám: “Um solche unfehlbare (Gabe), um ihre
Gunst …” Old, by contrast, suggests that the poet started out with the gen. etā́vataḥ,
meaning to continue with *sumnásya, but had to substitute the acc. sumnám for
metrical reasons. He then takes ádābhyasya either as continuing the gen. phrase
etā́vataḥ … *sumnásya or as having a separate referent, the Maruts considered as a
unity. Re also considers sumná- to be the ultimate referent, but has the genitive
phrase express a partitive sense: “Puisse le mortel avoir une part, (si) petite (soit-elle),
à la bonne grace …” Sim. Bl (RR) ad loc. In favor of the Old/Re/Bl solution is the
phrase etā́vataḥ … sumnásya in VIII.49.9 (Vālakh.), construed with īmahe ‘we beg’
(cf. 50.9); see also VIII.5.27 etā́vat&hellip; / &hellip; sumnám īmahe. But I find Old’s metrical
about-face very unlikely: RVic poets don’t have “whoops, that genitive won’t fit here”
compositional moments, as far as I can tell, while Re’s semi-partitive construction
seems rather weaselly. Moreover, √bhikṣ is almost always construed with the acc. as
here (genitives probably in I.152.6 and VII.90.6). And, further, in the scenario where
ádābhyasya is part of the phrase, “unfehlbar” (Ge), “unerring” (Bl) is not what
ádābhya- means. My solution is not necessarily better, though it does arise in part
from Old’s alternative suggestion for ádābhyasya. I take the gen. sg. phrase as
doubling the gen. pl., eṣām, with both referring to the Maruts &ndash; the plural to them
individually, the singular to their collectivity (so Old’s “von den als Einheit
gedachten Maruts”), i.e., the Marut flock (gaṇá-). This seems to be Gr’s view, also
Macdonell’s. It should be noted that the Maruts (in pl.) are several times referred to
as ádābhya- (II.34.10, III.26.4).
The publ. tr. reflects that analysis, but I am not entirely certain it is right. If I
were to follow some version of the other view, I would render bhikṣeta in two
different ways depending on the case of its complement: “might beg their
benevolence, might seek a share of such undeceivable &hellip;”</p>
<h3 id="viii716">VIII.7.16</h3>
<p>However odd the expression drapsā́ḥ … dhámanti “the droplets blow their
blast” may seem, it is found twice elsewhere: the extremely enigmatic VIII.96.13 and
the somewhat clearer IX.73.1. The latter is a noise-making context, as this may be.
VIII.7.16–17: 16c útsaṃ duhántaḥ reprises 10bc duduhré … útsam, which in turn
reminded us of dhukṣánta in 3c. Other elements in vs. 3 reappear in vs. 17:
pṛ́śnimātaraḥ in 17c was the subj. of dhukṣánta in 3b, and 17ab úd u … īrate … úd u
vāyúbhiḥ reminds us of 3a úd īrayanta vāyúbhiḥ (cf. also 7ab).
On svānébhiḥ in 17a see comm. on 14. Because vss. 16 and 17 are so closely
tied, I connect the drapsá- of 16a with the svānébhiḥ in 17a and consider this a
variant of svānaíḥ … índubhiḥ in 14c.</p>
<h3 id="viii718">VIII.7.18</h3>
<p>Note the extremely recessive 2nd pl. perfect āvá: 2nd pl. pfs. are rare and
poorly marked as it is; with its initial swallowed by yéna, this one barely surfaces.
The referent of yéna and its correlative tásya is most likely ‘help’ (ávas-); so
Ge. This assumption is supported by I.112.5 yā́bhiḥ káṇvam … ā́vatam “with which
you two helped Kaṇva,” where the referent of yā́bhiḥ is the etymologically related
ūtíbhiḥ and the same Kaṇva story as in 18b is referred to.
As for Turvaśa and Yadu &ndash; though, as Ge points out, their helper is usually
Indra, in this run of hymns the deed is assigned to several different gods: the Maruts
(here), Indra (VIII.4.7), the Aśvins (VIII.9.14, 10.5).
The construction of c is unusual. With Ge (and Re), I take tásya as a partitive
gen. with dhīmahi, though somewhat reluctantly. The dat. rāyé ‘for wealth’ is then an
indication of our purpose once we receive some help from the Maruts; Ge’s fuller
“um Reichtum (zu gewinnen)” makes the purpose clearer.</p>
<h3 id="viii719">VIII.7.19</h3>
<p>pipyúṣīr íṣaḥ echoes pipyúṣim íṣam in 3c.</p>
<h3 id="viii721">VIII.7.21</h3>
<p>Ge thinks that this verse is addressed to the other singers, but this requires
that the voc. vrktabarhi ̥ ṣaḥ in 20 and 21 have two different referents (so explicitly
Ge’s n. 3), which seems unlikely. I take the Maruts to be the addressees, as in vs. 20,
and follow Macdonell (Hymns from the Rigveda, p. 60) as well as Lüders (Var. 426–
27) in taking the verse as contrasting the Maruts’ former friendly behavior to the
poet and his fellow ritualists with their neglect now &ndash; a neglect drawn attention to by
the questions in the immediately preceding vs. 20. Acdg. to Delbrück (AiS 502), ha
sma purā́+ PRESENT expresses what was accustomed to happen in the past. I also
take stómebhiḥ not as the Maruts’ praise songs, but rather the ones produced by us,
as an instrumental of price. Macdonell’s tr. “as once ye did for praise…” seems to
reflect a similar interpr.
VIII.7.22–23: The insistently repeated sám in vs. 22 (4x in 3 pādas) is complemented
by its opposite ví in 23, though ví needs only two occurrences to continue the pattern.</p>
<h3 id="viii723">VIII.7.23</h3>
<p>arājín- is a hapax. Though it is obviously derived from a root √rāj, it is
not clear whether it belongs to ‘shine’ (so Gr ‘nicht glänzend’, Re ‘sans éclat’) or
‘rule’ (Ge ‘die herrenlosen Berge’; Old ‘königlos’) &ndash; or both, as I suspect. Although
neither root yields compelling sense as a negated quality of mountains, the phrase
should be interpreted in light of 1c ví párvateṣu rājatha, where I see the same pun.
It is possible that ví √yā should be rendered ‘drive through’, not ‘drive apart’,
although this produces a less happy contrast with sám in vs. 22. In that case I would
tr. “they drove through Vṛtra, joint by joint, (drove) through the mountains …”
On vṛ́ṣṇi see comm. ad VIII.96.19.</p>
<h3 id="viii724">VIII.7.24</h3>
<p>The pattern of repeated preverbs continues with ánu. The lexeme ánu √av
is quite rare (but see X.113.1); presumably the poet was looking for a preverb to
pattern with sám and ví in the previous vss. In X.113.1 I tr. ‘assist’, but ‘stand by’
here to provide a separable particle for the pattern.</p>
<h3 id="viii725">VIII.7.25</h3>
<p>I have punctuated pāda b as a parenthetical expression, a nominal
locational clause, but in context it is the equivalent of a decompounded bahuvrīhi
modifying the Maruts and parallel to vidyúddhastā(ḥ) ‘having lightning in their hands’
in pāda a (so approx. Re). A bahuvrīhi would have been difficult to construct with
these elements. Including the modifier ‘golden’ would have produced a threemember compound, which would be unusual for the RV, and determining what form
‘head’ (śíras- / śīṛṣ-ṇ-) would have taken as the final member of a masc. pl.
bahuvrīhi may have defeated the poet. This analytic expression is given somewhat
fuller form in V.54.11.</p>
<h3 id="viii726">VIII.7.26</h3>
<p>Like almost every verse involving Uśanā, this one is quite obscure. On the
morphology of the name, see my art. in Fs. Jasanoff; for the mythological
background and development of Uśanā, chap. 4 in my RV between Two Worlds. I
take this verse as a disguised treatment of the Vala myth, with which Uśanā Kāvya is
associated elsewhere. Pāda a is also found at I.130.9; there I take Uśanā as an acc. of
goal (or perhaps a gen. with a gapped ‘house’), while here I take it as an instr. As
discussed in the Fs. Jasanoff article, the word uśánā behaves essentially like an
indeclinable in the RV.
In my analysis the curious expression ukṣṇó rándhram “the loins of the ox”
(on randhrá- see Gotō 1985 [MSS 44] and EWA s.v.) is a reference to the Vala cave:
the loins are a weak or vulnerable spot in animals, and MIA randha- ‘opening, cleft,
weak spot’ shows how easily this can develop into a word that might qualify a cave.
A similar circumlocution for the Vala cave is náme góḥ “in the bend of the cow”
(III.39.6). Ge takes the phrase instead as a personal name; as he points out Ukṣṇo
Randhra is a PN in PB 13.9.19/JB III.150 and has the epithet kāvya-, apropos of the
so-called Aukṣṇorandhra Sāman, but this is surely a secondary reinterpretation of
this opaque vs.
The roaring in c is the noise of the cows penned inside the cave.
Note the phonetic echo in the initial words of the first two pādas: #uśanā /
#ukṣṇas.</p>
<h3 id="viii728">VIII.7.28</h3>
<p>práṣṭi- ‘side-horse’ is a rare word in the RV, occurring two other times in
addition to a single instance of the deriv. práṣṭimant-. As often, the occurrence of a
rare word can be attributed to phonological triggers; here prṣ̥́ atī ráthe / práṣṭir &hellip;
róhitaḥ (with a nice scrambling of th à h&hellip;t in ráthe … róhitaḥ). Our pāda b is also
found at I.39.6b, with rátheṣu pṛ́ṣatīr in the preceding pāda. (The other two
occurrences are less phonologically driven.)
The exact arrangement of the horses isn’t clear, and the sandhi form pṛ́ṣatī has
accordingly received different grammatical analyses. I take it as representing
underlying pṛ́ṣatīḥ, an acc. pl. fem., obj. of váhati (so also Gr, Bl). Ge (/Re) seems to
take it rather as a nom. pl. implicitly conjoined with róhitaḥ, presumably with the
verb agreeing with the latter. Hoffmann (Inj. 126) take the form as a dual nom., a
parallel subj. to róhitaḥ.
Old suggests that riṇán(n) is a nom. sg. participle, modifying the subjects of
yā́nti with incongruence of number. This seems unnecessary, since it can easily be a
3rd pl. injunctive, requiring no such grammatical adjustment.</p>

The verse seems to allude to the Maruts’ supposed leaving Indra in the lurch
at the Vṛtra battle, but this seems to be a slander: it is often said that they were the
only gods who stayed with him (though Ge adduces ŚB IV.3.3.6, where they
temporarily withdraw until Indra offers them a joint share of the sacrifice [7ff.].).
Certainly 24c expresses their help to Indra at that time.
VIII.7.32–33: Note opening 32a #saho ṣu / 33a #o ṣu. HvN mark o in 33a as

neut. acc. sg. ‘vital energy’, with the birds subject of vahanti in pāda a. Birds figure
in several nearby hymns (VIII.3.23, 5.33), with the latter passage esp. close: &hellip; vām &hellip;
váyo vahantu parṇínaḥ “Let your feathered birds [=horses] convey you two
[=Aśvins] here.” Ge instead takes the obj. of vahanti here to be the Maruts’ horses
(supplied), with the Maruts themselves presumably the subj. Scar (415–16) has the
Maruts as subj. and clouds as obj., but in the absence of any clouds in the context, it
seems better not to invent them. The disadvantage to my proposal is that the ‘birds’
reading of váyaḥ has to leap backwards over a nominal clause (dhā́tāra stuvaté …)
that clearly has the Maruts as its nominal referent. Nonetheless, I think this kind of
syntactic manipulation is possible in punning: the audience reaches the end of the
verse and realizes that ‘birds’ is the subject they were missing at the beginning, while
also interpretating váyaḥ as the neut. object of dhā́tāraḥ.
I am tempted to take dhā́tāraḥ as a periphrastic future: “they will establish …”</p>
<h3 id="viii736">VIII.7.36</h3>
<p>Pāda b contains two ambiguous forms, whose variant interpretations have
produced very different tr.: chándaḥ may be nom. sg. masc. to chánda- ‘pleasing’ (if
that stem exists; the only other possible ex. in the RV is at I.92.6, q.v.) or nom./acc.
sg. neut. to chándas- ‘meter’; sū́raḥ can be nom. sg. masc. sū́ra- &lsquo;sun&rsquo; or gen. sg.
svàr- &lsquo;id.&rsquo; The standard tr. opt for the former choice in both cases, e.g., Re “tel un
charmeur est le soleil, de par (son) éclat.” I have chosen the latter in both cases. The
verse is a reference to the ritual here-and-now, the kindling of the fire at dawn: the
phrase sū́ro arcíṣā “with the ray of the sun” is an indicator of that time. I take
chándaḥ as a metrical verse because the hymn opened with a similar metrical
expression: triṣṭúbham íṣam (see comm. ad vs. 1). The Maruts are characterized as
chandastúbh- ‘chanting in rhythm’ in V.52.12, a cmpd that unites the chandas- of
our vs. 36 with the 2nd part of triṣṭúbh- in vs. 1. To be born “like a metrical verse”
makes sense in a RVic context: the fire is kindled (born) as the verbal portion of the
ritual begins to be spoken (born).</p>
<h2 id="viii8-aśvins">VIII.8 Aśvins</h2>
<h3 id="viii84">VIII.8.4</h3>
<p>The hapax voc. adhapriyā is clearly based on the slightly better attested
kadhapriya-/-prī- (on which see comm. ad I.30.20), a form of which is found in the
immediately preceding hymn VIII.7.31. The latter is a dismissive and slighting form
of address (“when-friends?” &ndash; that is, fair-weather friends) whereas adhapriyaseems to be the opposite: “now/here-friends,” that is, reliable friends.</p>
<h3 id="viii85">VIII.8.5</h3>
<p>I construe both svā́hā and stómasya with úpaśrutī, although they are in
different pādas. (Ge takes svā́hā as an independent mini-clause and construes
stómasya with voc. vardhanā.) Although várdhana- regularly does take the genitive,
I am reluctant to take stómasya with it because we might expect the gen. to lose its
accent in a vocative phrase (although this loss is of course not invariable, as Old
points out). úpaśruti- also takes the gen. (see I.10.3), and since svā́hā is indeclinable,
it can also be dependent on úpaśruti-, at least as I see it. Old also floats the possibility
that stómasya goes with úpaśrutī, though he seems to favor a connection with
várdhanā.
It is not clear whose dhītí- ‘insights’ are in question in c. Ge takes them as the
Aśvins’, and the fact that kavī ‘poets’ qualifies them directly adjacent to dhītíbhiḥ
would support this view. However, in 19cd the dhītíbhiḥ definitely belong to the
(human) poet, and this also seems to be the case with suvṛktíbhiḥ in 3b (on the basis
of 22ab), as well as dhībhíḥ and stómebhiḥ in 7cd. In general the unrelenting point of
this hymn is that the Aśvins are supposed to come here at our producing various
verbal products for their delectation. I take the instr. in these cases to be
instrumentals of cause.
With prá in d I supply another verb of motion. Judging from his tr. Ge must
take the verb to be supplied as prá √as ‘be outstanding’: “Ihr … (seid) an Gedanken
… voraus.” This is not impossible, but this is a journey hymn and not much else
happens, esp. in this section: we offer praise; they come.</p>
<h3 id="viii86">VIII.8.6</h3>
<p>yác cid dhí vām purā́… is very like (nahí ṣma) yád dha vaḥ purā́in the
immediately preceding hymn (VIII.7.21), which, with a present tense verb, expresses
habitual action in the past. Here we have instead the med. 3rd pl. perfect juhūre
(found otherwise only in almost identical context in I.48.14; see Kü 606), also
apparently expressing habitual past action. (Delbrück [AiS 501–3] does not comment
on this usage.) In both cases (also I.48.14) that action is implicitly compared to what
is happening in the present. Here my praise is contrasted with those of the seers of the
past.
VIII.8.11, 14–15: The bahuvrīhi sahásranirṇij- ‘having thousandfold raiment’ is
found only in this hymn and does not seem a particularly natural qualifier either of a
chariot (vss. 11, 14) or of refreshment (15).</p>
<h3 id="viii812">VIII.8.12</h3>
<p>The stem manotár- is found only twice in the RV, in identical pādas
(I.46.2=VIII.8.12), in the dual manotárā, with unexpected short vocalism in this
strong form (expect *manotā́rā)—as opposed to manótar- (so accented), which
occurs only in the nom. sg. In I.46.2 the form appears in a pāda after one containing
likewise dual síndhumātarā, which has -tar- legitimately, and as Old says (ad I.46.2;
see also AiG III.199), manotárā might have been shortened in this context, with the
pāda then borrowed into VIII.8.12. But Old is not enthusiastic about this explanation,
and Tichy (-tar-stems, 58) persuasively suggests that the -mātarā form probably
provided the context for preserving the short vowel in manotárā, but was unlikely to
have produced it. But her explanation (if that’s what it’s meant to be), that manotárā
is “eine dichtersprachliche Reliktform” (58; cf. 41 n. 48, where she calls both manótā
and manotárā “dichtersprachliche Einzelformen”) doesn’t explain its source: the -
tar- vocalism should not be a relic if we assume that agent nouns derive from *-torstems, and blaming it on Dichtersprache is a non-account: poets don’t make up forms
with no reason, at least in my view. The problem is similar to dhánutarā (on which
see comm. ad IX.93.1), also dual, and though I have no good explanation for either
of them, the fact that they are built not to roots, like standard agent nouns, but to pres.
stems may have weakened the perceived links to -tar-stem inflection and allowed
them both to assimilate themselves to -tara-comparatives, whose duals would have
had the same -tarā.</p>
<h3 id="viii815">VIII.8.15</h3>
<p>The first hemistich reprises 8cd, but in this vs. the poet asks for something
in response to his strengthening hymns.
VIII.8.15–16: Another example of chained vocabulary: ghṛtaścút- ‘dripping with
ghee’, which is reasonably appropriate both for ‘refreshment’ (íṣ-, 14) and
‘nourishment’ (ū́rj-, 16).</p>
<h3 id="viii818">VIII.8.18</h3>
<p>I supply “who listen” in d on the basis of V.61.15 śrótāro yā́mahūtiṣu.</p>
<h3 id="viii819">VIII.8.19</h3>
<p>mayobhúvā in pāda a repeats the same word in 9d, with śambhúvā in b
generated as a variant to it.
Pāda d, gīrbhír vatsó ávīvṛdhat, is the third occurrence of this same pāda in
this hymn (also 8d, 15b, except the verb in 8 lacks the accent). The instr. pl. dhītíbhiḥ
at the end of c seems to double gīrbhíḥ, as śambhúvā does mayobhúvā in the first
half-verse.</p>
<h3 id="viii822">VIII.8.22</h3>
<p>It may not be clear in the publ. tr. that “found in many places” is a voc.
addressed to the Aśvins and does not qualify the songs and hymns. I take this form as
a “vocativized adverb” in Re’s phrase, derived from purutrā́‘in many places’,
against the standard opinion that it contains the root noun to √trā ‘protect’ and
means ‘protecting many’ (so Sāy, Gr, Ge). Scar (194) considers both options and
cannot decide. In fact I do not feel strongly about the analysis reflected in the publ. tr.
and could also accept ‘protecting many’. However, it might be worth noting that the
adv. purutrā́frequently occupies pāda-initial position, as here, and that there are
several occurrences of it in nearby hymns (VIII.1.7, 5.16, 11.8), one of which
(VIII.5.16) is in an Aśvin hymn. The Aśvins are the subj. of a form of √trā only once
(VII.71.2), but this is not a strong argument either way.</p>
<h3 id="viii823">VIII.8.23</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the three footsteps (trī́ṇi padā́ni) attributed to
the Aśvins must be meant to evoke the three celebrated padā́ni of Viṣṇu (cf. I.154.4).
Perhaps it is simply the Aśvins’ penchant for trios (not found in this hymn, however)
that is the point of contact. One might note, however, that in the next hymn (VIII.9),
also by Vatsa, vs. 2 asks the Aśvins to confer on us the power in the midspace, in
heaven, and “through the five peoples of Manu” (i.e., on earth). Since Viṣṇu’s three
steps cover the same three cosmic divisions, the Aśvins’ geographical reach may be
alluded to here. Even more striking in the next hymn (VIII.9.12d), the Aśvins “stand
in the strides of Viṣṇu” (víṣṇor vikrámaṇeṣu tíṣṭhathaḥ).
The purport of the paradoxical pāda b is also not clear; see speculations by
Old, Ge, and Re. I think it must have something to do with the anxiety expressed
throughout this hymn about exactly where the Aśvins are and our oft-expressed
desire for them to leave wherever it is and come to us. So we are never sure whether
they are visible or hidden.
The final pāda reflects our also stated desire that the Aśvins forsake other
sacrificers to come to us (see esp. vs. 8).</p>
<h2 id="viii9-aśvins">VIII.9 Aśvins</h2>
<h3 id="viii92">VIII.9.2</h3>
<p>For the possible relevance of this verse to VIII.8.23, see comm. ad loc.</p>
<h3 id="viii93">VIII.9.3</h3>
<p>pári √mṛś is a more vivid expression than Gr’s ‘geistig berühren’, Ge’s
‘befassen’ indicate: in X.34.4 it is the verb the Gambler uses in his tortured
imagining of others fondling his wife: anyé jāyā́m pári mṛśanti asya. Something
similar seems to be the point here. The Aśvins put their powers at the disposal of
other poets; Vatsa sees this promiscuity in almost sexual terms and begs them for an
exclusive relationship.</p>
<h3 id="viii94">VIII.9.4</h3>
<p>I take cíketathaḥ ‘attend to’ in a somewhat sinister sense here: with the help
(/invigoration) of soma the Aśvins will turn their attention to Vṛtra/the obstacle and
take care of the threat he/it poses. However, I am not entirely certain why the Aśvins
are being implicated in the Vṛtra battle and assimilated, as it were, to Indra. The
gharma of the 1st half-verse is more naturally their drink. But see 7cd below. Note
also that in 12a they drive on the same chariot with Indra. On the basis of that
hemistich, which also associates them with Vāyu (12b), we can assume that it is their
joint appearance at the dawn sacrifice that brings them into conjunction.</p>
<h3 id="viii95">VIII.9.5</h3>
<p>The referent of the yád’s in ab is not overtly expressed. Ge supplies
‘Heilmittel’ on the basis of vs. 15 with bheṣajám. That verse does not seem to me
particularly apposite. Nonetheless, I follow him, because the denom. bhaiṣajyá- is
found in the next vs. (6b), because bheṣajá- is elsewhere found in the waters (cf.
I.23.19), and because plants are generally associated with healing (see X.97).
kṛtám can be either a neut. sg. ppl., agreeing with yád, or a root aor. 2nd du. act.
injunc. Gr and Ge take it as the former; Old considers the latter, but rejects it on what
seem to me slight grounds. I take it as the latter, in part because the immediately
preceding hymn contains 2 of the 7 (per Lub; 8 if this is counted) examples of
accented finite 2nd du. kṛtám (VIII.8.13, 17) and also because I think it more likely
that the Aśvins would be portrayed as actively producing these remedies (see 6b)
than that the remedies simply got made. However, the ppl. interpr. is far from
excluded.</p>
<h3 id="viii96">VIII.9.6</h3>
<p>The rendering of ná vindhate in the publ. tr. is opaque. By “does not get
enough” I meant something like “produces in superfluity” &ndash; from Vatsa’s point of
view, there can never be enough praises for the Aśvins.
The sense relation between the yád clauses of ab and the main clause in c is
not clear. I think the idea is that even when the Aśvins are preoccupied with some
other activity, Vatsa keeps praising them on the assumption that they will pay
attention at some point.
I am also a bit unclear on how pāda d fits with the rest. I think that it
reinforces pāda c; that is, Vatsa keeps producing hymns because he knows that the
Aśvins ultimately come to someone who offers them sacrifice (here represented by
the havís- ‘oblation’). But it could instead mean that Vatsa is wasting his time,
because the Aśvins go for the oblation, not the praise. This seems less likely, esp.
since both praise and oblation are offered to the Aśvins in the next vs.</p>
<h3 id="viii97">VIII.9.7</h3>
<p>This new tṛca opens as the hymn does (1a): ā́nūnám, followed by a form of
aśvín-. The 2nd vs. of the tṛca (8) also opens with ā́nūnám.
Ge (also Lü 362) supplies a form of ‘speech’ with vāmáyā, obviously as part
of the seer’s ritual offering to the Aśvins. But vāmá- generally expresses the valuable
thing that the ritualist receives from the god(s) in exchange for his ritual service, and
I have taken it this way here, with (loosely) an instr. of price. I do not have an
explanation for its fem. gender, however. There are no other occurrences of a fem. in
-ā́to this adjective; most forms are masc. or neut, and the other fem. forms are in -ī́.
The honeyed soma and hot milk of vs. 4 return here.
Ge (also Lü), flg. Ludwig, takes átharvaṇi rather bizarrely as a nominative,
but there seems no reason not to interpr. it as the loc. it appears to be (so, e.g., Old).
Nor does there seem any reason not to take it as the name of a priest, as it is
elsewhere (pace Sāy., Old). I take it as a loc. absol. without an overt participle
marking it.
VIII.9.8–9: With Kü (181–82), I assign the curious paired reduplicated med. opt.
forms (ā́…) cucyavīrata (8) and ācucyuvīmáhi (9) to the caus. reduplicated aorist,
which is otherwise only active. I have no explanation for the difference in the grade
of the root syllable (-cyav- vs. -cyuv-); no morphological or metrical factors can
explain the variation between these two almost adjacent forms. Possibly the 3rd pl.
has full grade in some kind of imitation of the full grade of act. 3rd pl. imperfects to
redupl. presents (type ájuhavur vs. ájuhuma), but that is found only in the active
voice and not in the optative, so it would be a bizarre and tenuous imitation indeed.</p>
<h3 id="viii99">VIII.9.9</h3>
<p>The last pāda of the verse (d) is identical with the last pāda of vs. 3 (c), but
the point is very different. In vs. 3 the poet asks the Aśvins to pay attention only to
him despite the activities of other poets; here it’s “we” who are moving the Aśvins,
but the poet still asks for their exclusive attention. Given the constant interchange
between 1st singular and plural in ritual situations, I find it difficult to think that the
poet is trying to distance himself from his priestly comrades and get the Aśvins all to
himself. But I don’t have a good explanation.</p>
<h3 id="viii910">VIII.9.10</h3>
<p>The final pāda here is a variant of 3c and 9d, but the circumstances differ
from both. Here the poet doesn’t contrast himself with other rival poets (as in 3) or
with the larger group of “us” (as in 9), but asks that the Aśvins pay attention as they
did to previous seers &ndash; though actually not so previous: Kakṣīvant and Dīrghatamas
are of course famous poets represented in the collections of Maṇḍala I (I.116–26 and
I.140–64 respectively); Kakṣīvant is also identified in the Anukramaṇī as
Dīrghatamas’s son (or descendant). A son/descendant of Vyaśva, Viśvāmitra, is the
poet of VIII.23–26, and X.148 is attributed to Pṛthu (not Pṛthī) Vainya. So our poet
seems to be asking for the same attention as these famous seers received, but they are
not seers of the distant past but at most of a few generations ago, possibly even
roughly contemporary (though the perfect juhā́va puts the invocation in the past).
They are both models and, to a certain extent, rivals.
Pṛthi in the publ. tr. should be corrected to Pṛthī.</p>
<h3 id="viii916">VIII.9.16</h3>
<p>Ge tr. devyā́… vācā́(belonging to different pādas) as “mit der göttlichen
Rede,” which is certainly possible. But since Dawn is explicitly the topic of the next
two vss. (17–18) and since there’s a voc. devi (or possibly, against the Pp., a nom.
devī́) in pāda c, it seems best to separate the two instrumentals and take devyā́as
referring to Dawn. The poet has awoken with the advent of the goddess Dawn (the
natural world) at the same time as the ritual speech directed to the Aśvins
commences.
If nom. devī́is read here, vy ā̀var can be 3rd ps., not 2nd. But I see no reason to
go against the Pp. in this case, since Dawn is addressed in the voc. (uṣaḥ) in both 17a
and 18a, and the unambiguous voc. devi is found in 17b.</p>
<h3 id="viii919">VIII.9.19</h3>
<p>ā́pīta- is better derived from √pī ‘swell’ (so Ge, EWA s.v. PAYI
) than to
√pā ‘drink’ (Lub, Re [though Re allows a double sense]).
Pāda d requires a verb to be supplied with prá. I follow Re in supplying
‘wake’, on the basis of vs. 17. Ge kṛnvata (on the basis of I.186.10), thus “… (lassen)
… den Vorrang.” His model seems awfully distant, given that prá bodhaya appeared
two vss. previously.</p>
<h2 id="viii10-aśvins">VIII.10 Aśvins</h2>
<h3 id="viii101">VIII.10.1</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take dīrgháprasadman- as a PN, but I follow Gr and Old in
taking it as a fully lexical bahuvrīhi, ‘providing a long seat’. Both of the latter
consider the word an epithet of the earth, and the parallel cited by both, V.87.7
dīrghám pṛthú paprathe sádma pā́rthivam, is quite suggestive. However, the other
occurrence of this form in VIII.25.20 seems to narrow its application to the ritual
ground, rather than the earth in general.
I do not know quite what an ā́kṛta- house is, and the past participle kṛtá- is not
otherwise found with ā́. The publ. tr. ‘prepared, made ready’ follows Ge/Re.
However, since the lexeme ā́√kṛ generally means something like ‘bring here’, and
since there is no second vā in pāda c, I am tempted to tr. “on the sea in a house
directed here’, namely a boat, though this may be too whimsical.</p>
<h3 id="viii102">VIII.10.2</h3>
<p>Elsewhere héṣas(-vant)- means ‘weapon’, and I see no reason to ascribe a
different sense to it in this compound. So Lü (Philol. Ind. 783), contra Ge’s
‘Rosstreiber’, Re’s ‘à l’incitation rapide’. I am somewhat disturbed by the accent,
however.</p>
<h3 id="viii103">VIII.10.3</h3>
<p>Re points out the similarity of gṛbhé kṛtā́in 3 with ā́kṛte gṛhé in 1c.</p>
<h3 id="viii104">VIII.10.4</h3>
<p>Again Ge takes the presumed loc. asūré as a PN, explicitly rejecting Gr’s
‘sunless time’ in his n. 4b. But I do not see a good reason for this rejection, and given
that the Aśvins are the “early-coming” gods and receive offerings before dawn,
‘sunless time’ makes sense ritually. As Old and Ge both point out, asūré is involved
in word play with sūráyaḥ, which of course may account for the appearance of this
hapax here, as so often.</p>
<h3 id="viii105">VIII.10.5</h3>
<p>The final clause of this vs. contains a misleading ambiguity: the second
element in átha mā́gatam ‘so come to me” should be interpreted as mā ā́, but mā́
could also represent the prohibitive particle, with mā́gatam “don’t go” or even mā́ā́
gatam “don’t come.”</p>
<h2 id="viii11-agni">VIII.11 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="viii114-1">VIII.11.4</h3>
<p>The verb veṣi can be either a 2nd sg. indic. pres. or a si-impv. to √vī
‘pursue’. (See, e.g., the distribution as given by Lub 1330 and 1331; Lub takes this
occurrences as an indic.) Ge tr. it as an indic., Re as an impv., and the publ. tr. takes
it as an indicative present. Contextually I would (weakly) prefer the imperative, and
the undoubted si-imperative sátsi found in 10b might support this interpr. But I am
not certain that si-imperatives take ná as negative rather than mā́. Given their
derivational status as haplologized s-aor. subjunctives, ná should be quite correct, but
they have generally transferred functionally into the imperative domain and so might
be expected to take mā́, however anomalously. I know of no diagnostic passages.
The voc. ‘o Jātavedas’ was carelessly omitted from the publ. tr.</p>
<h3 id="viii1110">VIII.11.10</h3>
<p>The accent of sátsi is probably owing to its presence in a hí clause.
However, if one follows Ge and Re in seeing a suppressed “you have taken your seat”
to be supplied with sanā́t ‘of old’ (e.g., Re “assieds-toi comme Oblateur
nouvellement, (comme tu t&rsquo;es assis) anciennement!”), the accent could come from the
implicit contrast between the two verb forms.
The accent on pipráyasva is somewhat more difficult to account for, and,
curiously, the standard tr. and comm. do not mention it (incl. Kü 323). I think it also
arose by contrast with another verb form, namely ā́yajasva. The stem pipráya- to
which this impv. belongs (see Kü and my 2018 “The Vedic Perfect Imperative and
the Status of Modal Forms to Tense-Aspect Stems,” in Fs. Lubotsky), several times
co-occurs with a form of √yaj and on several of these occasions is accented (e.g.,</p>
<h3 id="viii399">VIII.39.9</h3>
<p>yákṣac ca pipráyac ca naḥ, also VII.17.4; cf. also II.6.8 without accent, all
cited by Kü 323).</p>
<h2 id="viii12-indra">VIII.12 Indra</h2>
<p>VIII.12.1–3: This tṛca is unified by a series of relative clauses (mostly introduced by
yéna) whose antecedent in the main clause is the tám that opens the refrain. The
presumed referent of all the relative pronouns (and the tám’s) is mádaḥ in 1b,
although it could be any power or capacity of Indra’s that comes to mind.</p>
<h3 id="viii121-1">VIII.12.1</h3>
<p>Although it is Indra whom we expect to be the best soma-drinker, here the
epithet is transposed to his máda- ‘exhilaration’.</p>
<h3 id="viii122-1">VIII.12.2</h3>
<p>Unlike Ge I take svàrṇara- here as an epithet of Adhrigu, rather than a PN
(sim. VIII.3.12), though not on strong grounds, and VIII.6.39, where I do take it as a
PN, undercuts this position.
Either Adhrigu or, if he is a personage, Svarṇara receives the qualifier
vepáyant- ‘setting atremble’, without an object. Given how little we know about
Adhrigu (or Svarṇara), it is not clear what such an object might be, though it might
refer to poetic inspiration.</p>
<h3 id="viii124">VIII.12.4</h3>
<p>Ge supplies a verb (verhilf) to govern the accusative phrase in ab, but
given the parallelism of vss. 4 and 5, it is better that this phrase is governed by the
juṣasva in 5a.
VIII.12.5–6: The verbal form that constitutes the refrain, vavákṣitha ‘you have waxed
strong’, is accented. Old plausibly attributes the accent to its position as a semiindependent refrain (Anhang), so that it is not necessary either to supply a
subordinator or to take the verb as an independent clause. Ge, by contrast, supplies a
subordinator, flg. Sāy (see Ge n.).</p>
<h3 id="viii126">VIII.12.6</h3>
<p>In c pratháyan is used differently in simile and frame. In the former it is
straightforwardly transitive, with vṛṣṭím as object; in the latter it is intransitive or, at
least, absolute, as in, e.g., IV.53.2.</p>
<h3 id="viii127-1">VIII.12.7</h3>
<p>Note the chaining between tṛcas, with the refrain of vss. 4–6 vavákṣitha,
returning as the first word of the following verse, vavakṣúḥ, with person and number
adjustment. Interestingly, it&rsquo;s this verse where the Anhang refrain doesn&rsquo;t precisely
match the two following verses: ávardhayat versus prá vāvṛdhe, with the same root
but different stem, and transitive versus intransitive. This is the only such deviation
in this hymn.</p>
<h3 id="viii128-1">VIII.12.8</h3>
<p>I take yádi in pāda a as standing for *yád ī, with shortening before the
cluster pr. See Jamison 2002. Hence ‘when’, not ‘if’. The *ī as usual functions as an
accusative, anticipating the obj. sahásram mahiṣā́n.
The word play between the voc. pravṛddha in a and the refrain verb prá
vāvṛdhe cannot be easily captured in English.</p>
<h3 id="viii129">VIII.12.9</h3>
<p>Ge takes the simile in c agnír váneva with ab: “Indra brennt … den
Arśasāna nieder, wie Agni die Bäume,” with sāsahíḥ only construed with the refrain:
“der Siegreiche ist erstarkt” (though see his n. on 9c). But this violates the structure
of the rest of the hymn, where the c pāda hangs together. I therefore take the quality
held in common between simile and frame to be sāsahíḥ. For √sah with this simile

VIII.12.10, 12: The verb initiating the refrain, mímīte, is accented, and in these two
verses the accent can be explained as a result of the status of the refrain; see above ad
vss. 5–6. In 11 it starts a new clause and can owe its accent to that.</p>
<h3 id="viii1210">VIII.12.10</h3>
<p>Encouraged by the insistent feminines, ṛtvíyāyatī here is a pun, referring
both to Thought’s conformity to the ritual order and to her menstrual cycle. See</p>
<h3 id="viii807">VIII.80.7</h3>
<p>for the same word play involving dhī́ḥ, where the femininity of the subject
is more emphasized than here. It is possible that the refrain here “she is (well-
)measured indeed” can also refer to the menstrual cycle. Otherwise it probably refers
to the metrical character of the thought and perhaps the fact that she measures up
even to Indra’s great size. The refrain also has to be considered beside a phrase in the
next hymn, VIII.13.30 mímīte yajñám ānuṣák &ldquo;measures the sacrifice in proper
order.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="viii1211">VIII.12.11</h3>
<p>The subject of this verse is not made clear. Ge suggests either stóma- or
dhītí-. The latter is more likely in my view, continued from vs. 10. There are no
clashing non-feminines, since devayúḥ could serve either for masc. or fem., and in
any case could be matching the gender of the gárbhaḥ. Another possibility is Agni,
since he is regularly called an embryo in these circumstances, but the unity of the
tṛca speaks against this. I would therefore change the “it”s in the publ. tr. (“its
intention,” “it has grown,” “it is”) to feminine forms, to match vs. 10.
The VP krátum punīte of b is found in the next hymn, VIII.13.1b, where the
subject is Indra, but that referent is not possible here.</p>
<h3 id="viii1212">VIII.12.12</h3>
<p>Since sáni- is only a nom. actionis, not an agent, it must mean ‘winnings,
gain’. What it must mean here is that Indra is what we win if we keep our part of the
sacrificial bargain (mitrá-).
The subject of c must again be the dhītí-. So also Ge. But the point of the
simile “like an axe” (vā́śīva) is somewhat unclear, though Ge’s explanation seems
reasonable: just as the thought is measured out metrically (mímīta íd), so is an axe
wielded in a regular rhythm (he compares VIII.19.23).
VIII.12.13–15: Lüders (Varuṇa 450) comments about the tṛca that it concerns only
the songs sung to Indra; therefore in the refrain ṛtá- can only refer to “die Wahrheit
des Liedes,” and the refrain ṛtásya yád is paraphrase for “das Lied.” I agree that the
refrain refers to the verbal product offered to Indra, but prefer to supply ukthá-
‘(solemn) speech’, extracted from ukthá-vāhas- in 13a for 13c and 14c.</p>
<h3 id="viii1213">VIII.12.13</h3>
<p>Ge interprets the verb abhipramandúḥ somewhat bizarrely as ‘go on a
pilgrimage to’ (“Zu dem … die … Āyu’s … pilgerten”), presumably influenced by
ukthávāhasaḥ ‘whose conveyance is solemn speech’. Kü (357) takes the same verb as
intransitive, with the yám expressing the source of pleasure (“An dem die Erregten
… sich (schon immer) erfreuen”). I see no reason why it is not a straight transitive
“bring to exhilaration” like other forms of the act. pf. of √mad.
The question is what is the relationship between ab and c. Properly speaking,
the yám should have a referent in the main clause (which is c: note the unaccented
verb pipye), but there is no obvious candidate. Ge simply treats ab as an unresolved
relative clause, without comment. I assume that Indra, the presumed referent of yám
in pāda a, is covertly present in c: it is his mouth in which the speech/hymn swells –
the speech having been homologized to soma already by the √mad form in b. See
also 4ab where praise is compared to purified ghee, which may mediate the simile in
our c, ghṛtám iva. Ge, however, seems to take the mouth as belonging to the Āyus
(“… ihrem Mund”); this would make sense as the source of the speech offered to
Indra. Perhaps the lack of an overt genitive limiting ‘mouth’ allows both
interpretations some currency. I might therefore emend the publ. tr. to “it swells in
his/their mouth.”</p>
<h3 id="viii1219">VIII.12.19</h3>
<p>Ge tr. the infinitival gṛṇīṣáni as a modal “soll … loben.” Similarly
Keydana, who takes it as a “matrix infinitive” with 2nd ps. subject but tr. modally
(“… sollt ihr euch zu Hilfe besingen,” 174, 246). Because it is locative in form, I am
somewhat dubious about assigning it this value, which is typical, and understandable,
for dative infinitivals.
I have reordered the elements in c to make the sentence parsable. That the
refrain vy ā̀naśuḥ should be construed with what precedes is shown by the parallel</p>
<h3 id="viii4527">VIII.45.27</h3>
<p>vy ā̀naṭ turváṇe śámi &ldquo;he came through to victory by his labor.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="viii1224">VIII.12.24</h3>
<p>Note the slight variation on the refrain: abl. ójasaḥ, parallel to abl. ámāt
in b, versus 22–23 dat. ójase.
Ge supplies “the world” (extracted from the dual of a) as subject of titviṣe in c.
I follow Old in taking Indra as subject, with the asya reflexive. As Old points out, in
nearby VIII.6.5 it is Indra’s ójas- that is subject of the same verb; here the attribute
has been deflected to an oblique case and the god himself is subject. Note also X.55.1,
where Indra is modified by the participle titviṣānáḥ.</p>
<h3 id="viii1225">VIII.12.25</h3>
<p>The opening verse of this tṛca echoes that of the last tṛca (22), with 22ab
índram …, devā́so dadhire puráḥ matched by 25b devā́s tvā dadhiré puráḥ.
VIII.12.25–28: The phonetic figure noted in VIII.6.36 dominates the next four
verses: haryatā́hárī.</p>
<h3 id="viii1227">VIII.12.27</h3>
<p>That te in a is a dative of benefit, not a genitive with ójasā is shown by</p>
<h3 id="viii523">VIII.52.3</h3>
<p>yásmai víṣṇus trī́ṇi padā vicakramé.
VIII.12.28–30: The linkage of tṛcas is unusually close here, with the pāda-length
refrain of vss. 25–27 recast as the first hemistich of vs. 28 and ā́d ít te, which opened
the refrain of 25–27, retained as the opening of the refrain of 28–30.
For the only time in the hymn the Anhang is only three syllables, yemire, but
this deviation is probably a word play. Old rejects Ge’s older suggestion that we
should read ní yemire as the refrain on the basis of niyemiré in 28b, but although Old
is probably correct that we should not change the text by accenting ní, I think he was
too hasty in dismissing the idea out of hand. The refrain ā́d ít te víśvā bhúvanāni
yemire temptingly juxtaposes the final syllable of the neut. pl. bhúvanāni and the
verb yemire, and of course bhúvanā without its -ni would be a fine neut. plural as
well. The audience is surely being invited to consider alternative segmentations.</p>
<h3 id="viii1229">VIII.12.29</h3>
<p>The doubling of te … túbhyam is presumably pleonastic in ab, with the
yadā́te simply repeated from 27a, 28a.
VIII.12.31–33: This tṛca is unified by the 4-syllable pāda prā́dhvaré. This pāda
appears also in VIII.46.18 and IX.102.8, always as the final pāda of Uṣṇih (or the
equivalent: in 46.18 Upariṣṭādbṛhatī). I interpr. it in the context of the fairly frequent
fuller expression prayaty àdhvaré, a loc. absol. meaning “while the ceremony is
proceeding,” which is esp. common in VIII: I.16.3 = VIII.3.5, V.28.6 = VIII.71.12,
VIII.7.6, VIII.13.30, X.21.6; cf. also VI.10.1). I take prā́dhvaré as a truncated version
of this loc. absol. and tr. it “while the ceremony is pro(ceeding).”</p>
<h3 id="viii1231">VIII.12.31</h3>
<p>Pāda c presents some difficulties of interpretation, in particular how to
distribute the three accusatives jāmím, padā́, and pípratīm. The last, a participle,
takes padám as object in IX.10.7 (adduced by both Old and Ge): padám ékasya
píprataḥ “guiding the track of the lone one safely across.” But it also takes personal
objects, as in nearby VIII.6.2 prajā́m rtásya p ̥ íprataḥ “guiding the child of truth
[=poem] safely across.” I therefore take it as a semantically mixed construction, with
jāmím ‘kin’ (which in this case, as in VIII.6.2, would be a poem or hymn) in the
frame and ‘footsteps’ in the simile. By contrast, Ge takes jāmím as the subject of the
simile, parallel to suṣṭutím: “die wie eine Schwester deine Schritte geleitet.” His
interpretation reads better, but ignores the position of iva and also the contrasting
constructions of the participle píprat- elsewhere. By my interpretation the point is
that the suṣṭutí- produced in ab takes the rest of the verbal portion of the sacrifice
along with it to the god.
I take the refrain prā́dhvaré as a (quasi) locative absolute, as in VIII.46.18,
rather than as integrated into what precedes.</p>
<h3 id="viii1232">VIII.12.32</h3>
<p>Contrary to Ge, I take pāda c as part of the subordinate clause of ab, with
vs. 33 the main clause. Ge. is forced to supply a verb (“geht”).
dohánā is the problem here. Gr suggests we read it as underlying dohánās as
in I.144.2, despite the sandhi. This seems to be the basis of Ge’s interpretation (“die
Melkung” as subject), but Old rejects this and takes it as an instrumental. I weakly
follow Old, but neither of the interpretations is particularly compelling.</p>
<h2 id="viii13-indra">VIII.13 Indra</h2>
<p>Although the intro. to the publ. tr. is somewhat dismissive of this hymn and
dubious about any unifying factors, closer examination shows a subsurface thematic
unity esp. in the mid and later parts of the hymn, roughly vss. 16-30. For discussion

<p>The word apsujít never occurs without an immediately preceding sám,
whose function is not clear. See VIII.36.1–6, IX.106.3. Dissatsifaction with this
expression goes back to Ludwig, and Scar (154–55) suggests that the phrase is a
metrically more favorable version of *apsú sáṃjit “completely victorious in the
waters.” This has some merit, but it’s also worth noting in this metrical context that
there seems to be a feeling that a preverb is a good way to start the final four
syllables of an Uṣṇih, and when in doubt sám is a safe one. See in the previous hymn
VIII.12.16-18 sám índubhiḥ (though the sám is functional there), 22-24 sám ójase, -
aḥ. In its other two occurrences (VIII.36.1–6, IX.106.3), sám apsujít is a separable 4-
syllable pāda (as long as one accepts Old’s analysis of the meter of VIII.36; see
comm. there).</p>
<h3 id="viii133">VIII.13.3</h3>
<p>“I call” in the publ. tr. is a careless error for “I have called,” tr. augmented
ahve and should be changed.</p>
<h3 id="viii136">VIII.13.6</h3>
<p>In c the subject of sg. rohate ‘grows’ is apparently unexpressed. Ge
supplies Indra, while supplying the songs as subject of the pl. juṣánta, which he
seems to take as transitive ‘please’: “dann wächst er [n. Indra] wie Zweige nach,
wenn sie [n. Lobreden] wohlgefallen,” though I have trouble interpreting his tr. But
forms of juṣáte almost always mean ‘take pleasure’, not ‘give pleasure’ (see 29b for
juṣánta in just this sense). To tackle the latter problem first, I take the subject of
juṣánta to be the closest plural noun, namely ‘branches’. Although the notion of
branches enjoying themselves seems odd, I suggest it may refer to their growth under
favorable conditions, with good soil and the proper amounts of water and light.
(Modern gardening manuals often say that a plant “likes” this or that condition.) As
for the subject of rohate, I take it as an imperfect pun: the form vayā́(ḥ) is, on the one
hand, the nom. pl. of vayā́- ‘branch’; however, a *váya(ḥ), which would differ from
the text only by accent and the length of the final vowel, could be the nom. sg. of the
neut. -s-stem meaning ‘vitality’, and so I take it. Alternatively one could follow
Bloomfield’s suggestion (made at the parallel passage II.5.4) that vayā́(ḥ) is the masc.
nom. sg. of an internally derived *vayás- ‘possessing vitality, vital one’ (=Indra). In
fact I now prefer this solution and would change the publ. tr. accordingly, to “the
vital one grows” (though in this case we might expect a 2nd sg. verb). (In II.5.4 this is
unnecessary because Agni is easily and properly supplied as subject, and the tree
branches work fine in the simile.)</p>
<h3 id="viii1314">VIII.13.14</h3>
<p>Although Ge interprets the stretching of the thread as a metaphorical
expression for the continuation of old relationships, it seems far more likely that it
reflects the normal idiom “stretch the thread” for setting up and performing the
sacrifice. See vs. 18b devā́so yajñám atnata. “The way that is known” means the
standard procedure. That Indra is being urged to do this, rather than the sacrificers,
might be a little odd, but see, in fact, 18b just cited, as well as 30c mímīte yajñám.</p>
<h3 id="viii1315">VIII.13.15</h3>
<p>The next section of the hymn is introduced by the end of this verse
(a)vitéd asi “Just you are (our) helper,” a phrase repeated in 26a índra tvám avitéd asi,
signalling the subsurface thematics of the apparently disordered midsection of this
hymn.
VIII.13.16–18: This tṛca begins and ends in the same way: 16a índraṃ vardhantu no
gíraḥ and 18c tám íd vardhantu no gíraḥ … In between are several clauses with
augmented verb forms (aor. arāniṣuḥ 16c, impf. avardhayan 17c, aor. atnata 18b). It
is not immediately clear if these form a mythological or historical sequence or are
unconnected observations about the mythological and/or historical past. The most
specific statement is found in 18ab, with the gods stretching the sacrifice
tríkadrukeṣu. This same verse is found in VIII.92.12, which, however, provides no
contextual help. But, as Ge points out, in I.32.3 Indra drinks soma tríkadrukeṣu
before the Vṛtra battle, and II.11.17 and II.22.1 suggest the same scenario. If 18ab is
somehow concerned with a soma sacrifice connected to the Vṛtra battle, then 17 may
belong to the same complex, with the “inspired poets” of 17ab perhaps being the
Maruts, who in some version of the myth encouraged Indra before the Vṛtra battle,
and, again perhaps, their battle cries also strengthening Indra in 17c. Note that JPB
tentatively identifies the Trikadrukas in I.32.3 and II.11.7, 22.1 as the Maruts. The
clause in 16c may also belong with these mythological references, if the clans (víśaḥ)
are the same as or equatable with the marútvatīr víśaḥ in 28c.</p>
<h3 id="viii1317">VIII.13.17</h3>
<p>I am puzzled as to what “downward coursing help(s)” (pravátvatībhir
ūtíbhiḥ) might be. As Ge points out, vs. 25 shows that the instr. phrase should be
construed with avardhayan and so it must be help that the poets are giving Indra
rather than getting from him (though they themselves are also avasyávaḥ ‘seeking
aid’). The stem pravátvant- is generally used of landscape/cosmic features that have
a gentle, and by implication pleasant and easily traversed, slope; see esp. V.54.9,
where heaven and earth, the paths, and the mountains all provide a pravát- for the
Maruts’ journey. The help provided to Indra by the poets may be of the same quality,
smoothing and easing his journey to the sacrifice and his participation in it. In our 8b
we met waters at play going along a slope (pravátā). Again ‘downhill, sloping down’
implies the path of least resistance and the opposite of effortful activity. If the
identification of the poets with the Maruts suggested above is correct, it might be
worth noting that four of the seven forms of pravátvant- are found in a single verse
in a Marut hymn (the aforementioned V.54.9).
We meet vayā́iva again, repeating the simile of 6c. As in 6 I think that the
tree branches are compared with Indra (and hence are acc. here), rather than being
compared to the battle cries. They make Indra grow as tree-branches grow.</p>

<h3 id="viii1319">VIII.13.19</h3>
<p>It is noteworthy that the properly performing praiser acquires epithets
esp. characteristic of Agni and Soma (śúci-, pāvaká-), the quintessential ritual gods.
Pāda c is an interesting twist on IX.24.6–7; see comm. there.</p>
<h3 id="viii1320">VIII.13.20</h3>
<p>This verse is quite opaque and its grammar can be construed in a number
of different ways, giving the lie to Ge’s breezy “Die Konstruktion ist klar.” See Old’s
rather more despairing assessment (“Es ergeben sich mannigfache Möglichkeiten,
zwischen denen sichere Entscheidung ausgeschlossen…”).
The first problem is the value of the verb cetati and, when that has been
determined, the identity of its subject. Ge takes the verb as intransitive/reflexive “…
zeichnet sich … aus,” but an I/T value (‘perceive’) is also possible for this active
stem. I interpret it so (as does Old in one of his suggested tr.), and continue as its
subject the stotā́of vs. 19.
The next issue is the reference and distribution of tád íd rudrásya … yahvám,
which Ge takes as subject of cetati and I as object. I will not rehearse the various
suggested possibilities (see Ge and Old), but simply add my own: rudrásya is
generally used with &lsquo;son(s)&rsquo; to refer to the Maruts, who can be called &lsquo;young&rsquo; in that
context (cf. V.42.15b rudrásya sūnū́m̐r yuvanyū́n&hellip;); and a neut. noun regularly used
for the Maruts is śárdhas- ‘troop’, as in the nearby hymn VIII.15.9c śárdhaḥ …
mā́rutam. In fact see mā́rutaṃ śárdhaḥ in the pāda immediately preceding V.42.15b,
namely 15a, where the singular (15a) and plural (15b) expressions are coreferential.
So here I supply that noun with tád … yahvám.
Then what are the “ancient domains”? On the basis of IX.52.2 pratnébhir
ádhvabhiḥ “along your age-old routes,” referring to the protocols of the soma
sacrifice and the ritual journey of soma, I suggest that the ancient domains here are
the age-old practices of the sacrifice. It is essentially equivalent to 14c tántuṃ
tanuṣva pūrvyáṃ yáthā vidé “Stretch the ancient thread in the way that is known.”
In c I take vícetasaḥ to refer again to the Maruts. For the switch between
singular and plural see V.42.15 just cited. The Maruts are called vícetas- in V.54.13.
What the whole verse means and what function it fills in the hymn are not
clear to me. If my interpretation of the various parts is correct (and I have no
confidence that it is), the successful human praiser of vs. 19 perceives his divine
model, the Maruts, whose praise inspired Indra in the Vṛtra battle, at his sacrifice,
where they have placed the thought or mental power that he should himself follow.</p>
<h3 id="viii1321">VIII.13.21</h3>
<p>I struggle to make the final verse of the tṛca fit with the speculative
scenario sketched for the first two verses (19–20). (As far as I can tell, neither Ge nor
Old makes the attempt, an omission with which I am in sympathy.) One thing to
account for is the switch from 3rd ps. in 19–20 (though note te in 19a) to a 1st
–2nd
partnership in 21. I suggest that the stotā́in 19 (and 20, by my reading) is now the 1st
ps. speaker of 21. He offers Indra companionship or partnership (sakhyám) modeled
on that shared by Indra and the Maruts, of which he had a vision in vs. 20. The sign
of Indra’s chosing his companionship will be his (=Indra’s) acceptance of the
speaker’s offered soma.
On ā́váraḥ see comm. on I.143.6. It may be better to tr. it as ‘grant’, rather
than ‘choose’. If so, I would change the sentence immediately above to “The sign of
Indra’s granting his companionship …”</p>
<h3 id="viii1322">VIII.13.22</h3>
<p>One piece of evidence for my interpretation of the preceding tṛca as
having the praiser (stotár-) as its thematic center is his reappearance in this verse, in
this anxious question. The verse expresses the reciprocity inherent in the ritual
situation, with the praiser wishing to be “most wealful” for Indra, while also
receiving his own benefits from the god. This reminds us of verse 17, where the
poets (quite possibly the Maruts) were both seeking help and making Indra increase
through the help they gave him.</p>
<h3 id="viii1324">VIII.13.24</h3>
<p>Pāda b yahvám pratnā́bhir ūtíbhiḥ is a deliberate echo of 20a yahvám
pratnéṣu dhā́masu, and the only indication that yahvám is neut. in 20b but masc. in
24b are the pronouns tád and tám respectively that open the a-pādas. The phrase
pratnā́bhir ūtíbhiḥ also recalls pravátvatībhir ūtíbhiḥ in 17b. These patterns suggest
there is some reality to the below-the-radar thematic unity I’ve sketched out for the
three tṛcas, vss. 16–24.</p>
<h3 id="viii1325">VIII.13.25</h3>
<p>This verse both parrots the preceding verse (24ab … puruṣṭutȧm, …
ūtíbhiḥ / 25ab … puruṣṭuta, … ūtíbhiḥ) and concentrates into a single expression the
reciprocal aid between god and praiser that has dominated the rhetoric of the last
tṛcas. In the command vardhasva … ūtíbhiḥ “become increased … by forms of help,”
the instr. should express the means by which Indra becomes strong, and that should
be the help given him by others, as in vs. 17 tám íd víprāḥ … ūtíbhiḥ / …
avardhayan… “The inspired poets increased him with helps.” But the forms of help
in 25 are ṛ́ṣistutābhiḥ ‘praised by the seers’, which suggests that these are forms of
help given by Indra to us, like those in 24b. The condensed expression in this verse
sets up a closed circle, a never-ending loop, in which forms of help given and
received are identical and have identical results. With that established, the poet then
presses his advantage and in pāda c and in 26a puts Indra squarely in the role of
helping us.</p>
<h3 id="viii1326">VIII.13.26</h3>
<p>See remarks on the repetition in pāda a under vs. 15 above.</p>
<h3 id="viii1327">VIII.13.27</h3>
<p>Although Ge gives up on the cmpd. pratádvasū, which modifies hárī, Old
plausibly suggests that it’s a univerbation of the frequent collocation prá tád “forth to
that” or perhaps prá tád vásu “forth to that good thing,” perhaps as the actual
command Indra “cries out” to the horses. Rendering it in English is somewhat
clumsy.</p>
<h3 id="viii1328">VIII.13.28</h3>
<p>Note the chaining over tṛca boundary: 27c … abhí svara# / 28a #abhí
svarantu.
Most interpreters (Ge, Old, Klein [I.383]) take sakṣata as the verb of the
relative clause beginning yé táva, but it is unaccented. Old recognizes the problem
but considers it unnatural to separate táva from śríyam and accounts for the lack of
accent acdg to ZDMG 60, 737–38 [=Kl.Sch. 212-13], namely occasional lack of
accent when the rel. pronoun and the verb are in different pādas (not, in my opinion,
a compelling explanation in any of these cases). But yé táva functions fine as an
independent rel. clause, and supplying ‘your’ again with śríyam is no problem in an
independent clause.
Ge supplies “come” in c, but the verb in b can do duty here as well.
The Maruts, who were only latent in vs. 20 (and probably 17), appear here
with Rudra, who was present in vs. 20. The Marut clans here may pick up the clans
in 16c; see above.</p>
<h3 id="viii1329">VIII.13.29</h3>
<p>As Ge says, the subject here probably remains the Maruts. The question
is whether “which is in heaven” is a restrictive or non-restrictive relative clause –
that is, are there various possible tracks and it’s the one in heaven that they like, or is
there one track and it happens to be in heaven. My inclination is to take it as
restrictive, and the track or footstep in which they take pleasure is the one called
elsewhere the paramá- (I.22.20–21, 72.2, 4, 154.5, etc.), upamá- (V.3.3), or uttamá-
(V.51.4) ‘highest’, as well as divás padá- (IX.10.9, 83.2). There seems to be an
implicit contrast to this high and distant padá-, which they like, and “the navel of the
sacrifice” (nā́bhā yajñásya), where they find themselves. But these locations may be
more complementary than contrastive, since the “highest track/footstep” often seems
to indicate a place where a heavenly form of the earthly sacrifice is conducted
simultaneously. See, e.g., I.22.20–21 and remarks on I.21.6.</p>
<h3 id="viii1330">VIII.13.30</h3>
<p>This verse uses some of the material found in the previous hymn, also in
Uṣṇih: prā́ci prayaty àdhvaré is a heavy variant of prā́dhvaré (that is, prá adhvaré) of
VIII.12.31–33; mímīte is identical to the refrain mímīta íd (12.10–12); ānuṣák occurs
in 12.11.
Who is ayám? This near demonstrative should mean that the referent is
actually present. It can only be Indra. In the first two verses of the tṛca the focus is on
his companions, the Maruts (“who are yours [=Indra]” 28a), and now attention turns
to their leader, the subject of the hymn as a whole, and in the finale to the hymn his
longed-for epiphany is signalled by this dramatic ayám.
That Indra himself “measures the sacrifice” is consistent with his being urged
to “stretch the thread” in 14c above.
Ge’s interpretation of ab is quite different from mine, and seems to envisage
the sacrifice receding in the distance as the subject keeps gazing further out towards
it. This doesn’t make much sense to me, and the similarity of the expression in b to
the cliched prá adhvaré (see just above), which refers to the temporal progress of the
ritual (and in this case, perhaps the carrying of the Āhavanīya fire eastward), makes
his interpretation unlikely.
The only other occurrence of dīrghā́ya cákṣase is in I.7.3, where Indra puts
the sun in the sky for this purpose. See remarks ad loc., where I point out that the
expression can be either temporal or locational or both.</p>

<p>Misplaced simile marker in pāda a.
Both verbs in this verse are nonce forms: ajirāyate and arājiṣuḥ. Note their
mirror image phonology, ajirā / arāji, which may help account for the creation of
both the hapax denominative and the nonce iṣ-aorist. The former is built to ajirá-
‘quick’; the latter could belong to either of the √rāj roots, ‘rule’ or ‘shine’. Ge seems
to opt for the former, at least judging from his invocation of ví rājasi in the preceding
and following hymns (VIII.13.4=15.5) in his n., but his “haben den Ausschlag
gegeben” (decided the issue) is hard to derive from ‘rule over’ and also doesn’t make
much sense to me. But his n. also cites ví rājati in IX.61.18, where it clearly means
‘shines forth’, and also cites Sāy’s gloss dīpyante. Narten discusses the issue and
finally decides (weakly) for ‘shine’, an interpretation I share.</p>
<h3 id="viii1411">VIII.14.11</h3>
<p>The two -várdhana- compounds express something of the same type of
role reversal found in the last hymn, where the help given by Indra and received by
Indra became conflated. Here we might expect Indra to be strengthened by the
praises and recitations, rather than strengthening them. And in fact, contrary to
grammar, both Gr and Ge so interpret the compounds (Gr ‘am Loblied sich erlabend’,
Ge “Denn dir sind … die Lobgesänge, die Lobgedichte eine Stärkung”). But -ananominals have transitive-causative force and are associated with -áya- verb stems,
and in compounds their first member serves as object. See other -várdhanacompounds such as nṛmṇa-várdhana- ‘strengthening manly powers’ (II.36.5), paśuvárdhana- ‘strengthening livestock’ (IX.94.1), as well as numerous other stems such
as yajña-sā́dhana- ‘making the sacrifice succeed’ (2x). If we stay true to the
grammar, the point is that Indra, by his presence at the sacrifice and his willingness
to receive praise, strengthens the products of his praisers, and this in turn creates
bhadrá- for them, as pāda c says.</p>
<h3 id="viii1412">VIII.14.12</h3>
<p>The last two words of the verse are yajñám surā́dhasam “sacrifice, very
generous,” which appear to belong together, but the latter must in fact modify índram,
the first word of the verse, as it usually does. A textbook example of why word order
is not a reliable guide to RVic interpretation.</p>

<p>By the rules established in Jamison 1992 for sá with 2nd ps. reference, sá

could invoke a *sáṃ rājasi here (which would change the meter, but not improperly).

<p>In c jayā can be a 2nd sg. imperative with lengthened final (so Pp., Gr, Ge)
or a subjunctive (jayāḥ out of sandhi). Although an undoubted form of the imperative
is found in 12c (jaya), I weakly favor the subjunctive here, the idea being that the
praisers keep praising the same deed, and so he will keep doing it.
VIII.15.7–10: Every half-verse in this tṛca but 7c and 10c opens with a form of the

<h3 id="viii159">VIII.15.9</h3>
<p>Since kṣáya- otherwise means only ‘dwelling place’, the text as we have it
means “Viṣṇu, the lofty dwelling place,” as in the publ. tr., not “der hohe Wohner”
(my italics), as Ge would have it. Already BR (see Gr s.v. kṣáya-) suggested that we
read instead a bahuvrīhi *bṛhát-kṣayaḥ ‘having a lofty dwelling place’. This of
course makes better immediate sense, but I think we can keep the text as we have it
and also avoid making kṣáya- into a nonce agent noun (per Ge). Given the flexibility
of RVic diction, it is not difficult to identify a god with his most characteristic
product —in this case, Viṣṇu’s three footsteps, particularly his highest one, which
becomes an important locus in heaven (see, e.g., I.22.19–21) — and he elsewhere is
said to create dwelling places: VII.100.4 ví cakrame pṛthivī́m eṣá etā́ṃ, kṣétrāya
víṣṇur mā́nuṣe … / urukṣitím … cakāra “Quick Viṣṇu strode across this earth for a
dwelling place for Manu … / He has made wide dwelling.” In the RVic conceptual
realm it is just one step from creating a dwelling place to being a dwelling place. The
identification of Soma with a dwelling place in vs. 13 below supports the literal
reading here.</p>

<p>The identity of the addressee in this verse is not overt. As Ge points out,
Sāy suggests that the singer is addressing himself, though pādas ab make difficulties
for that interpretation. Old argues for Soma, which seems likely even though,
unusually for an Indra hymn, soma has not previously figured in this hymn. However,
all three pādas have parallels in the soma maṇḍala: for pāda a see IX.109.3c mahé
kṣáyāya; pāda b is repeated in IX.25.4a modifying soma; and IX.111.3e is identical
to the first three words in pāda c, save for the grammatical identity of the verb form
(3rd pl. injunctive in IX.111.3, 2nd sg. imperative here). That Soma is the addressee
here and so the subject of the impv. harṣayā is also supported by vs. 4 in the next
hymn (VIII.16), where the exhilarating drinks (of soma) are called harṣumánt-.
Again, as in vs. 9, Ge waters down the meaning of kṣáya- to fit the context
(“dweller,” not “dwelling”), but in his n. suggests that the dwelling, namely heaven,
stands as a metonym for its inhabitants, the gods. I prefer not to recast and
paraphrase the literal sense as Ge does, especially since, as it stands, this half-verse
expresses a small but neat paradox involving container/contained: Soma both enters
everything (b) and provides a vessel in which everything (or &ldquo;we&rdquo; anyway) can dwell
(a).

<p>The simile in c, apā́m ávo ná samudré, is hard to interpret. “The sea”
corresponds to Indra in the frame and “the aid of the waters” should correspond to
recitations and famous deeds, but what is the aid of the waters? Ge suggests in
passing a possible connection with avániḥ ‘stream(bed)’, but this seems based only
on superficial phonological similarity, and in the end he tr. “die Gunst der Gewässer”
and hopes for the best. Old suggests an emendation to apā́m *ápaḥ ‘work of the
waters’, but it is hard to see how a nice alliterative phrase like that would become
corrupted, and so, like Ge, I stick to the text transmitted and the common word ávasthat it seems to contain. Perhaps the point is that, like recitations that find their joy in
contributing to Indra&rsquo;s power, the waters take pleasure in submerging themselves in
the sea, “aiding” the sea by making it bigger.</p>
<h3 id="viii163">VIII.16.3</h3>
<p>How to construe maháḥ in c is not clear. I tentatively take it as the gen. sg.
of máh- and supply ‘prize’ or “wealth’. Lub groups it with the adverbial maháḥ
‘greatly’, which is also possible. I do not understand how Ge takes it grammatically,
given his tr. “der grosse Beute macht,” which must somehow be rendering mahó
vājínam.</p>

<h3 id="viii166">VIII.16.6</h3>
<p>The rare verbal stem ā́rya- ‘recognize’ is probably a derivative of the aríword family (including ā́rya- ‘Ārya, that is, belonging to our group’) and means
‘recognize as an Ārya, treat as an Ārya’. See EWA s.v. ĀR, where some doubts are
expressed, and recently Kulikov (522–23), who tr. “Him alone the races treat as an
ārya through his activities …”</p>
<h3 id="viii168">VIII.16.8</h3>
<p>The content of ab is straightforward, but it is worth noting the
phonological play. On the one hand the independent pronouns sá … sá of pāda a are
picked up in b by sa(tyáḥ) sá(tvā́). On the other, the morphologically parallel forms
stómi
yaḥ &hellip; hávi
yaḥ in a are picked up by the morphologically different satyáḥ in b.
(This would be a neater figure if the first two words didn’t show distraction in the
suffix, as opposed to satyá-.) Then the -tyáḥ of satyáḥ morphs into the -tvā́of satvā́,
which then distracts into tuvi- in the following word.</p>

<p>Old discusses who/what to supply with yujā́, suggesting first the bráhmanof 2c, but then opting with Gr (tr.) and Ge, for soma. See Ge “(mit Soma) im Bunde.”
Old rejects the possibility that it is Indra, which is the solution I have adopted here. I
do so because you=Indra is almost the default with yujā́throughout the RV. For exx.
in VIII see nearby VIII.21.11 tváyā … yujā́(where the referent of the 2nd ps. is Indra)
and VIII.68.9 tvā́yujā́(ditto), etc., etc., and for the full noun I.23.9 índreṇa … yujā́,
etc. I would in fact suggest that the poet is here making the enclitic tvā do double
duty; it is the correct accusative goal with havāmahe, but it also evokes the accented
older short instr. tvā́that as an independent word is limited to constructions with yujā́.</p>
<h3 id="viii177">VIII.17.7</h3>
<p>The consensus that soma is covered (sáṃvṛtaḥ) with milk is surely correct;
this is simply a different way of expressing the mixing of the two substances that is
such a common trope in the soma maṇḍala, where it is often said that soma is clothed
in cows (/milk). But the simile presents difficulties. For both Old and Ge a coveredup person (presumably male) is going to women/wives (Ge “soll … wie ein
Verhülter zu Frauen schleichen”). Neither of them makes any comment on this
bizarre image. I prefer to follow Caland-Henry’s interpretation (cited and rejected by
Old): “voilé comme des femmes [qui vont au rendez-vous].” There is evidence
elsewhere in the RV of women going to trysts (e.g., X.40.2), and the abhisārikā, a
woman going secretly to her lover, often depicted as veiled or disguised, is, of course,
a standard figure in the later literary and visual arts traditions. (Perhaps the
untethered abhí in this pāda refers to this idiom, although it must be admittted that
neither √sṛ or √sṛp appears with abhí in the RV.) There are a few grammatical
difficulties to address. First, sáṃvṛtaḥ is masculine and singular, whereas the
corresponding women are feminine and plural, but sáṃvṛtaḥ refers to soma in the
frame, and the later rules about grammatical agreement between elements in the
frame and the simile simply do not hold in the RV. More serious is the fact that the
nom. pl. of jáni- is normally jánayaḥ. However, the asigmatic nom. sg. jánī in
IV.52.1 shows that a long ī-stem jánī- had been extracted from the ambiguous forms
acc. pl. jánīs and gen. pl. jánīnām (cf. AIG III.144).</p>
<h3 id="viii178">VIII.17.8</h3>
<p>vapódara- is a hapax, but its general analysis is fairly clear: it’s a
bahuvrīhi with udára- ‘belly’ as second member and some word for ‘fat’ or ‘bulging’

takes it to be vapā́‘omentum’. See EWA s.v. vapā́-.

<p>kuṇḍapā́yya- is a technical term in later śrauta ritual; see Old. I have

refers to.
The verb dadhre is taken by Old as most likely a 1st sg.; Ge allows that
possibility but tr. with a 3rd sg. I supply Indra as subject, both because he is the deity
of the hymn and because he is the default consumer of soma. Kü (264) takes the verb
as intransitive and presential with mánaḥ as subject: “darin bleibt das Denken fast.”
He also notes the possibility that this is a 3rd plural to √dhā, rather than belonging to
√dhṛ.</p>

<p>There may be phonetic play between dívā in a and ádvayāḥ in b, faciliated
by the áditiḥ that opens each pāda.</p>
<h3 id="viii187">VIII.18.7</h3>
<p>The naḥ of pāda a was careless omitted in the publ. tr., which should be
changed to “will come to us with her help.”
The text of pāda a reads utá syā́no dívā matír, with matí- ‘thought’. Ge takes
this pāda a as a separate clause: “Und dies ist unser Gedanke bei Tag.” But the
context seems to enforce Aditi as referent for syā́: note the insistent repetition of nom.
sg. áditiḥ in all 3 pādas of the previous vs., once also associated with dívā; the initial
áditiḥ of our pāda b; the parallel opening of 8a utá tyā́, also with a divine referent. Re
uses his trademark parentheses to manipulate the syntax, yielding “this celebrated
Aditi, (the object of our) poetic thought” &ndash; “cette-célébre Aditi, (objet de notre)
pensée-poétique” &ndash; which can’t be legitimately extracted from the text. The text as
transmitted, with two fem. nominatives, should rather encourage an identification of
Aditi with “thought,” a step I am reluctant to take. I suggest instead a slight alteration
to the text, which could have read *dívāmátir, i.e., dívā + *amátir ‘banner’, contra the
Pp. This requires only a change in the accent, which could have been redactional,
arising because of durmatím in 10b (cf. also ámatim in 11b). In this reading Aditi is
implicitly compared to a banner or ensign. Although this comparison is not found of
Aditi otherwise, amáti- is associated elsewhere with the Ādityas: Mitra and Varuṇa
(V.62.5, 69.1) and Savitar (VII.38.1, 2, 45.2, 3).
Although as a noun, we would expect śáṃtāti to be feminine, hence *śáṃtātim
in context, I prefer to take it here as a nonce neuter noun, rather than as a nonce
neuter adjective modifying máyaḥ, contra Ge’s “beglückende Freude.” Perhaps
instead of a neuter, we might consider it an honorary indeclinable, matching its base
śám ‘weal’, which opens 8b and all three pādas in vs. 9; our śáṃtāti … karat would
be entirely parallel to 8b śám … karataḥ and 9a śám … karat.
Gr identifies a lexeme ápa √kṛ for just this passage, on the basis of the
sequence … karad ápa srídhaḥ, but ápa srídhaḥ is the refrain of this tṛca and must
therefore be independent of what precedes it.</p>
<h3 id="viii1819">VIII.18.19</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take hīḷáḥ as a gen., construed with ántaraḥ interpreted as
‘between’; hence “the sacrifice comes between (us and) your anger.” But this poses
several difficulties: antarā́and sometimes antár mean ‘between’, but ántaraordinarily means ‘nearer, dearer’; moreover, the other party to the ‘between’ reading,
namely ‘us’, is not in the text. Old’s solution, which I follow, avoids both difficulties.
He takes hīḷáḥ as an ablative (also accepted by Schindler, Rt Nouns), construed with
the comparative ántaraḥ. The idea must be that, given the choice between holding on
to their anger and accepting a sacrifice, they will opt for the latter. This sentiment
might be more straightforwardly expressed in English by “Sacrifice is closer to you
than your anger,” rather than the publ. tr. “There is a sacrifice …” However, I am
disturbed by ásti: a copular sentence like the one suggested does not need, and should
not have, a surface copula. I therefore take it as an existential “there exists a sacrifice
that is closer …” As for the accent, ásti may be accented because it follows a pādainitial voc. or because it is immediately followed by another verb and shows
contrastive accent.</p>

<p>The verse contains a double 2nd ps. address: implicitly with oblique 2nd ps.
plural prn. vaḥ in pāda a, explicitly with the (singular) voc. phrases in b and the 2nd
singular prn. tvám in c. The latter invoke Agni, of course, but the former are most
likely, in my opinion, the assembled peoples bringing together their clan fires. (See
publ. intro.) Ge suggests rather the “Opferveranstalter” (arrangers of the ritual),
which would ordinarily be the default reading of vaḥ in this type of context, but
given the political agenda of the hymn, I think it covers a greater number of mortals
than simply the ritual officiants. In the publ. tr. I take the vocc. of pāda b with c,
which allows the vocatives to be the correct grammatical number and addressed to
the correct personage. Strictly speaking, however, this logical division is not
syntactically possible, as the vocc. are unaccented and must therefore belong with the
preceding clause, ending syā́ma. Nonetheless, the slight violation in the tr. seems
justified by sense.</p>

VIII.19.11–12: The VP cáno dadhīta “should take delight” takes complements in two
different cases (both found independently elsewhere), acc. stómam (11b), havyā́
(11c) and loc. rātíṣu (12b), all connected by vā (11c, 12a). Another ex. of the poets’
enjoyment of syntactically licensed case disharmony.
Note the alliterative v’s of 11c havyā́vā véviṣad víṣah (immediately preceded
by 11b … viśvávāryaḥ and immediately followed by 12a víprasya vā …) and of 12d
váso vividúṣo vácaḥ.</p>
<h3 id="viii1912">VIII.19.12</h3>
<p>Both Ge and Re take the hapax avódevam, modifying vácaḥ, as meaning
‘below / inferior to (that of) the gods’. This makes a nice contrast to upárimartyam
‘above (that of) mortals’. However, it otherwise seems an odd sentiment: it is surely
a given that anything we mortals produce will be inferior to whatever comes from the
gods, but this is a given that we don’t necessarily want to emphasize. In this ritual
context the point of our speech is that it should be good enough (better than that of
other mortals) to bring the gods to us. Hence something like Gr’s “die Götter
herunterholend, sie herablockend” seems preferable (see also Kü 492). The
compound itself is a version of, or manipulation of, the reasonably common
expression avó divā́/ diváḥ (I.163.6, V.40.6, VIII.40.8, IX.74.6).</p>
<h3 id="viii1914">VIII.19.14</h3>
<p>My semantic reasons for rendering áditim as ‘boundlessness’ here, rather
than as the PN of the goddess (contra Ge/Re), are given in the publ. intro. I would
add here that √dāś almost never otherwise takes an acc. of the recipient of the pious
service (except V.41.16 and possibly VI.48.2), but does occasionally take an acc. of
the offering (e.g., I.71.6, 93.3). It’s also the case that áditim makes an irregular
cadence: it should have an initial heavy syllable, though I don’t know what to make
of that or how to repair it. There is also some phonetic play between pāda-final
áditim and the final of 13a (havy)ádātibhiḥ.
Ge, flg. Sāy, takes víśvā (&lt; víśvéd, i.e., víśvā+íd) with jánān and explains its
neut. pl. form as attraction to udnáḥ, “das trotz der maskulinen Form doch Neutr. ist”
&ndash; a convoluted and quite dubious explanation. It seems best to take the neut. pl. form
seriously (with Re; see also Old) and supply another (underlyingly masc. pl. ) ‘all’
with jánān, by perserveration, as it were. (Old and Re do not go that far.)
As for Ge’s supposed udnáḥ, the Saṃhitā text of d reads dyumnaír udná iva
tāriṣat, and the Pp. analyses the 2nd word as udnáḥ. But, as the HvN restoration udná
‘va shows, the pāda has one too many syllables. Moreover, the second syllable of
udná would be better heavy. I follow Gr in assuming an instr. udnā́here, despite
Old’s curt dismissal. The underlying text may have been either udnéva or udnā́‘va. I
find entirely baffling the Old/Ge preferred underlying form udnáḥ (presumably
because they wish to follow the Pp.) and their analysis of it as acc. pl. masc. because
the expected neut. pl. cannot be produced (“für den kaum herstellbaren neutralen,” so
Old). Why would *udā́(ni) be blocked when áhā(ni) ‘days’, to an entirely parallel
stem, is produced frequently and easily? Re prefers taking putative udnáḥ as a gen.
sg., which has the merit of not arbitrarily changing the stem’s gender, but requires
supplying an acc. (kṣódaḥ) for it to modify. Old’s objection to the instr. sg. is that it
isn’t parallel to the accusatives over which the mortal is crossing. But instr. udnā́is
the idiomatic expression for traversing water (cf. V.45.10 udnā́ná nā́vam anayanta),
and we have already had another instance of case disharmony in parallel expressions
(see comm. on vss. 11–12).</p>

<p>Note the near mirror-image dyumnám (a) and manyúm (c).</p>
<h3 id="viii1916">VIII.19.16</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take cáṣṭe here as ‘appears’, but this sense is otherwise not
found for this stem, and I see no reason why the gods are not seeing by means of the
illumination (dyumná-) that Agni provides. (Ge allows for the possibility of ‘sieht’ in
n. 16a.)
It is the same illumination that we wish to acquire, in order to become the best
path-finders (gātuvíttama-), presumably since it’s impossible to find one’s way in the
dark. My interpr. of vidhemahi reflects this desire for acquistion and differs from the
standard rendering ‘honor, do reverence to’ (so Ge/Re). My interpr. depends first on
the analysis of √vidh as historically derived from ví √dhā ‘divide, ritually distribute’
(see EWA II.555–56) and further on the observation that our form is the only real
medial form to this secondary root (vidhanta in III.3.1 is an -anta replacement).
While act. vidhéma, etc., means “may we distribute ritual shares (à do honor to),”
the contrastive middle can mean “may we receive ritual shares” &ndash; much like the
functional distribution of bhájati / bhájate. It might be argued that we should not take
the middle form seriously because vidhemahi has been artificially created to produce
an iambic cadence out of a Triṣṭubh cadence, given that act. vidhema is most
commonly final in Triṣṭubh pādas. But in I.36.2 and I.114.2 the enclitic te serves this
purpose: … vidhema te #, a solution that would have been available here.
There is some phonetic play between the pāda-final (gātu-)víttamā(ḥ) and
vidhemahi.</p>
<h3 id="viii1917">VIII.19.17</h3>
<p>The first hemistich resembles VIII.43.30 té ghéd agne svādhyò, &lsquo;hā víśvā
nrcák ̥ ṣasaḥ, but in my opinion has a very different meaning. Given vs. 16, in which
Agni’s brilliance produces the light by which gods and men see, I take nṛcákṣashere as ‘providing sight for men’, as opposed to its usual senses ‘having (one’s) eyes
on men’ or ‘having a manly gaze’.</p>
<h3 id="viii1918">VIII.19.18</h3>
<p>Ge takes diví as ‘at day(break)’, but this loc. is almost always used of
heaven (so also Re), save for a few expressions like pūrvyám diví “early in the day”
(II.22.4, VIII.22.6) and diví pā́rye “on the decisive day” (VI.17.14, etc.) and the
cmpd. diviyáj- (IX.97.26) ‘sacrificing in the day’. To make this locative work, I see
the hemistich as containing two slightly different constructions, both involving
cakrire. I supply that verb from b to govern the accusatives in pāda a, where it has
the straightforward sense “made X.” But in pāda b, governing the acc. + loc., it
means rather “make X (to be) in Y,” i.e., “put X in Y.” It is possible that the second
acc. in a, ā́hutim, also participates in that construction (“make the poured oblation [to
be] in heaven”), but it is unlikely that védim does: the altar is surely earthbound. And
since Agni is said to be ‘bepoured’ (ā́hutaḥ) in the next vs. (19a, also 22d, 23a, 25c),
the poured oblation may well stay on earth too.</p>
<h3 id="viii1919">VIII.19.19</h3>
<p>Both Ge and Re take this verse as expressing a wish (Ge “Glück bringend
(sei) uns Agni …”). This is possible, but there is no overt modal, and a straight
equational reading is perfectly fine.</p>
<h3 id="viii1920">VIII.19.20</h3>
<p>Ge takes sthirā́simply as ‘Kräfte’, but (with Re) on the basis of the
bahuv. sthirá-dhanvan- ‘having sturdy bows’ and phrasal instantiations thereof (e.g.,
in the next hymn, VIII.20.12 sthirā́dhánvāni), I supply ‘bows’.</p>
<h3 id="viii1923">VIII.19.23</h3>
<p>Ge takes pāda a as the dependent clause and b as the main clause, but this
causes a difficulty: why is bhárate accented? I follow Re in taking ab as the
dependent clause and c as the main clause. This accounts for the verbal accent. It also
solves another problem: yádī is hard to render as ‘if’, but if analyzed as yád ī (for this
phenomenon see Jamison 2002 [Fs. Cardona]), the ī can, as often, double the object,
in this case vā́śīm. But if vā́śīm is not part of the dependent clause, ī has no obvious
function.
The question then arises, what is pāda c doing? It consists of a nom. (ásuraḥ),
a simile marker (iva), and an acc. (nirṇíjam). What binds them together? With Re, I
supply *bharate as the verb, from bhárate in b. The verb is used in two different
senses: in b it describes the up-and-down motion of Agni raising and lowering
(“bearing”) his axe, i.e., his flames, when ghee is poured on the fire, but in c ‘bears’
means ‘wears’, of a garment. This is a standard idiom; cf. I.25.13 bíbhrad drāpiṃ
hiraṇyáyaṃ váruṇo vasta nirṇíjam “Bearing [=wearing] a golden mantle, Varuṇa
dons his cloak.” This is yet another example of the fondness the poet of this hymn
has for parallel but disharmonious constructions.
Rather than trying to identify a particular divinity as the ásura- in this simile
(Re: Varuṇa; Ge: “die Asura”), I concur with Hale (Asuras, 68–69) that this probably
refers simply to a rich human lord who would be distinguished by his fine clothing.
In the frame the nirṇíj- would be the ghee with which Agni is bepoured. Cf. V.62.4
ghrtásya nirn ̥ íg; sim. VII.64.1, IX.82.2.</p>
<h3 id="viii1927">VIII.19.27</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take this brief verse as a self-contained sentence, but this
requires that masc. súbhṛtaḥ modify neut. havíḥ. Though the masc. can be explained
as attraction to putráḥ in the simile, the sentence still doesn’t yield compelling sense.
In this vs., a brief pendant to the preceding pragātha, I prefer to take pāda a as
completing, contrastively, the thought of 26cd. In the fantasy role reversal depicted
in vss. 25–26, where “I” am the god and “my praiser” is Agni, my praiser would not
be ill-established (dúrhitaḥ 26c), but well-kept (súbhṛtaḥ) in my house (27a). The
two adjectives are complementary, and I therefore take the subject of 27a to be the
praiser (not the oblation nor, as Ge also suggests [n. 27ab], Agni). (This is more or
less Old’s view.) Pāda b is then an independent ritual instruction.</p>
<h3 id="viii1929">VIII.19.29</h3>
<p>The three táva’s morph from subjective to objective genitives: the will
(krátvā) is definitely exercised by Agni, hence subjective genitive, while the lauds
(práśastibhiḥ) are those praising Agni, hence objective. The gifts (rātíbhiḥ) can be
either those given by or given to Agni. This sequence is framed by two exx. of táva
(…) ūtíbhiḥ “with your help(s)” (28a, 30a), with subjective genitive.</p>
<h3 id="viii1930">VIII.19.30</h3>
<p>On āváraḥ see comm. on I.143.6. It may be better to tr. it as ‘grant’,
rather than ‘choose’ &ndash; hence “(the man) to whom you grant companionship.” The
general sense is essentially unaffected either way: a man who is Agni’s companion
thrives.</p>
<h3 id="viii1931">VIII.19.31</h3>
<p>The voc. siṣṇo is a hapax. Flg. Gr (hesitatingly endorsed by EWA, s.v.), I
take it as a nonce u-adj. to a reduplicated form of √sani ‘gain, win’. Although an
analysis as a desiderative u-adjecive is morphologically impossible (there being no
trace of a desid. suffix), I still wonder if that is the semantic nuance here &ndash; as if it
were an aniṭ variant of siṣāsú-. Ge tentatively follows Ludwig’s connection with
√sā/si ‘bind’ (“du Fänger”); Re tr. it as a PN and considers it an imitation of viṣṇo. It
might also be a deformation of *śiśo, the expected but unattested voc. to śíśu- ‘child’,
a frequent epithet of Agni. The context does not strongly favor (or disfavor) any of
these hypotheses, and none of them is particularly strong.
ā́dade is variously interpreted; even its root affiliation is disputed: to √dā
‘give’ (which with ā́in the middle means ‘take’) or √dā ‘bind’. I take it to the former
and assume an idiomatic meaning ‘take’ of a fire just “catching hold,” starting to
burn &ndash; an idiom also present in English (at least my English). If it also has its
standard meaning ‘take [goods, etc.]’, the kindled and spreading fire could be “taking”
everything in its path, and the ‘desire to gain’ sense I imputed to siṣṇo might be
weakly supported.
Gr, Ge, and Re take kṣapáḥ as gen. sg. dependent on vástuṣu (Ge: “beim
Hellwerden der Nacht”), though Re raises, and rejects, the possibility that it is acc. pl.
&ndash; the analysis I favor. The acc. pl. of kṣáp- is found elsewhere in extent-of-time
usage. Case disharmony (here between acc. and loc. pl.) is esp. common in temporal
expressions, and, as we’ve seen, there are a number of other disharmonious phrases
in this hymn.
VIII.19.34–35: These two vss. are so interrupted by heavy voc. phrases addressed to
the Ādityas that it is difficult to follow the thread. The poet identifies a mortal who is
especially favored by the Ādityas (34b) and who therefore holds power among men
(35b) and then expresses the hope that “we” might be “they” (vayám té … syā́ma,
35cd), that is, the fortunate man just identified. The switch in numbers is somewhat
disconcerting, but can presumably be ascribed to attraction to the 1st pl. pronoun:
“might we be he/that one” doesn’t work well in either Sanskrit or English.</p>
<h3 id="viii1935">VIII.19.35</h3>
<p>The triple voc. phrase váruṇa mítrā́ryaman is accented despite being
internal in a pāda that begins with tonic elements. There is no obvious reason for
this: although the vocc. follow the caesura and immediately follow an enclitic (vayám
té vo, váruṇa mítrā́ryaman), neither of these factors ordinarily triggers voc.
accentuation. See, e.g., I.122.7 stuṣé sā́vāṃ, varuṇa mitra rātíḥ, where both
conditions are found. For discussion of a similar case, see comm. ad VII.59.1.</p>
<h3 id="viii1937">VIII.19.37</h3>
<p>túgvan- is a hapax. Ge and EWA (hesitatingly) take it as ‘ford’, following
one suggestion of Gr’s; Old and Hoffmann (Injunk. 234–35) as ‘Stromschnelle,”
following another. Of the two, ‘ford’ would make better sense in context: all this
giving would be better at a place where the animals aren&rsquo;t likely to be swept away by
a rapidly flowing river. On the other hand, the likely root etymon, √tuj ‘thrust’, is not
really conducive to ‘ford’. Re’s ‘source’, which I follow, solves both problems: a
river at its source is generally a fairly placid affair, and √tuj is used esp. of the
thrusting forth of progeny, a situation to which the arising of a river could be
assimilated.</p>
<h2 id="viii20-maruts">VIII.20 Maruts</h2>
<h3 id="viii202">VIII.20.2</h3>
<p>sudītíbhiḥ could also modify the chariots (so Ge), but Re suggests that it is
a separate nominal when in the instr. pl., rendering it as “avec (vos) beaux éclats,”
and I am inclined to agree on the basis of VI.48.3d sudītíbhiḥ sú dīdihi.
VIII.20.3–4: Pādas 3a, 3c, and 4a all begin with vi, with the last example doubled ví
(d)vī. This sequence is anticipated by 2a vī.</p>
<h3 id="viii204">VIII.20.4</h3>
<p>The vs. describes the effects of the monsoon. The first hemistich contains
three injunctives (pā́patan, tíṣṭhat, and yujanta) and the last pāda a present (éjatha),
but pāda c contains the apparently augmented airata. Given this collection of verbs,
it is difficult to produce a consistent temporal interpretation. The injunctives can
harmonize either with the preterital airata or with the presential éjatha, but those two
are incompatible. A way out of this dilemma was shown by Hoffmann (Injunc, 210),
who suggests that the “cacophonous hiatus” dhánvāni *īrata was avoided by
substituting the augmented form for the injunctive. (It would be good to have other
exx. of such a hiatus-avoiding technique, however.) The whole verse can then be
interpr. as presential or “general.” This temporal value continues in vs. 5, also
describing the effects of the storm, with two present-tense verbs.
The second clause in pāda a, tíṣṭhad duchúnā, has been interpreted in two
opposing senses. Ge supplies the ví of the first VP and tr. “das Unheil breitet sich
aus.” But without the ví the verb would mean ‘stand (still)’ or ‘stop’ (so Re “stoppe
le misère”). I favor this latter interpretation. Since the monsoon brings desired rain,
which makes the plants grow and produces food and attendant well-being, it stops
misery in its tracks, as it were. This stoppage contrasts with the movement of the
features of the natural world in pādas a and c.</p>
<h3 id="viii205">VIII.20.5</h3>
<p>There are several ways to treat pāda a. The simplest (and to my mind the
least satisfactory) is simply to take ácyutā as another subject of 3rd pl. nā́nadati (so,
e.g., Schaeffer, Inten.). With Ge and Re, an intrans. ‘shake’ (vel sim.) can be
supplied, on the basis of passages like VI.31.2b ácyutā cic cyāvayanta rájāṃsi,
whose d-pāda ends ájman ā́te, very like this pāda. I favor a different solution: simply
continuing yád éjatha “when you stir” from the preceding pāda (4d). Although the
two verses do not belong to the same pragātha, the continuity of theme is clear.</p>
<h3 id="viii206">VIII.20.6</h3>
<p>Given that the Maruts are displaying their tvákṣāṃsi on their own bodies
(tanū́ṣv ā́), I wonder if there is a little pun on tvác- ‘skin’.</p>
<h3 id="viii207">VIII.20.7</h3>
<p>I read ánu both with what precedes (svadhā́m) and what follows (śríyam)
and do not, contra Ge, take the latter as obj. of váhante. Med. forms of váha- are
several times used reflexively of the Maruts’ progress (V.58.1, V.60.7, V.61.11,
X.77.6) without obj.
My tr. of vṛ́ṣa-psu- and áhruta-psu- (as well as vṛ́ṣa-psu- in 10a) are owing to
Thieme. See reff. at comm. ad I.49.3.</p>
<h3 id="viii208">VIII.20.8</h3>
<p>Against most tr., I take pāda a as an independent nominal clause and
construe b with c. The locc. in b refer to the chariot and its box, onto which the
Maruts are mounting. The same phrase two hymns later, VIII.22.9 ā́hí ruhátam …,
ráthe kóśe hiraṇyáye, with a verb of mounting, seems to clinch this interpr., though
Ge (n. 8b) explicitly claims that the two nearby phrases, in hymns by the same poet,
are used differently.
I think gó-bandhu- ‘having a cow/cows as kin’ is a pun, an interpr. not
registered in the publ. tr. On the one hand it refers to the Maruts’ mother Pṛśni; on
the other, on the basis of vā́ja-bandhu- ‘having prizes as kin’ (VIII.68.19) and the
word play in the adjacent hymn, VIII.21.4 (see comm. there), it is also a clever way
to say that the Maruts have cows at their disposal to give to us. These are the same
cows with which the music is anointed in pāda a.
I do not see any way around supplying a verb of motion or mounting in bcd:
the Maruts mount their chariot or come in order for us to enjoy the nourishment they
bring (cf. 2c iṣā́nah … ā́gatā “come here to us with nourishment”) and to gain other
desirable things, in two parallel infinitive phrases (iṣé bhujé … na spárase).
The root noun íṣ- is tr. two different ways in 2c (‘refreshment’) and 8c
(‘nourishment’). These should have been harmonized.
VIII.20.9–10: The ‘bull’ stem (vṛ́ṣa(n)-) is dominant in these verses (9b, 9c, 10a
[twice], 10b), with this sequence phonologically inaugurated in 9a with vṛṣad(-añji-)
‘raining unguents’, a synchronically distinct word.</p>
<h3 id="viii2012">VIII.20.12</h3>
<p>Ge takes tanū́ṣu as attenuated to something close to a reflexive (“sind
nicht auf sich selbst eifersüchitig”), but in vss. 6 and 26 it is lexically robust. I think
the point here is to contrast the adornment of their bodies with that of other locations
associated with them (their chariots and their faces).</p>
<h3 id="viii2013">VIII.20.13</h3>
<p>That their name can be “broad/widespread like a flood” may at first seem
odd, but the point is simply that it is widely known.
Pāda b expresses another common point about the Maruts: they do not have
individual names (though see V.52.10–11), but “Marut” serves for each one of them.
I differ from Ge and Re in taking gen. pl. śáśvatām ‘of each and every one’ as
referring to the Maruts, not to the mass of people; therefore in my view the subj. of
the inf. bhujé is the Maruts, not these same unidentified people.
I do not know if pítrya- here refers specifically to the Maruts’ ancestors (esp.,
presumably, Rudra), as I have taken it, or whether this is a more general statement:
“like ancestral life force” (so, more or less, Ge and Re).</p>
<h3 id="viii2014">VIII.20.14</h3>
<p>As Old points out (and as is reflected in Ge’s and Re’s tr.), ná must stand
for *ná ná, i.e., the simile marker followed by a negative. The same no-last-spoke
image is found in V.58.5 with alternative realizations of both simile marker (iva) and
negative (privative a-): arā́ivéd ácaramā(ḥ).
The pāda break between c and d goes counter to the syntactic parallelism:
syntax: tád eṣām dānā́ meter: &hellip; tád eṣām,
mahnā́tád eṣām dānā́mahnā́tád eṣām
This produces a syncopated effect, emphasized by the polarized positions of the
parallel instr. dānā́and mahnā́in their nominal clauses.</p>
<h3 id="viii2015">VIII.20.15</h3>
<p>In c the presence of both vā ‘or’ and utá ‘and’ is curious, as is the
position of the latter. Klein (DGRV I.450) suggests that the placement of utá after
nūnám means that it should be construed with that adv., and so vā and utá each
retains its own force.</p>
<h3 id="viii2016">VIII.20.16</h3>
<p>The yásya vā opening this verse, parallel to yó vā in 15c, shows that this
clause is still dependent on the main clause in 15ab subhágaḥ sá “very fortunate he
…” The main clause in 16c may refer only to the vājín- of ab or to the various
subhága- folk of vss. 15–16.
The hapax gatha in b is an anomalous form, with a present 2nd pl. ending (-
tha) on a root aorist stem. It is clearly a nonce form generated beside 2nd pl. impv.
gata in 10d. The pādas are otherwise almost identical: 10d havyā́no vītáye gata, 16b
ā́havyā́vītáye gatha.</p>
<h3 id="viii2017">VIII.20.17</h3>
<p>The identity and distribution of forms in pāda b are oddly unclear. Is
diváḥ dependent on ásurasya, or are they coreferential, or are they independent of
each other? In the first instance this produces “lord of heaven” (as I have it in the
publ. tr; see also W. E. Hale [Asura, p. 75] “of the asura of the Sky”); in the 2nd
“Lord Heaven” (so Ge: “Asura Himmel”); in the 3rd Re’s “(les hommes) du ciel, de
l’Asura.” Do these genitives qualify Rudra (gen. rudrásya in a), as I take it, or
vedhásaḥ (so Ge: “die … Meister des Asura Himmel,” sim. W. E. Hale), or, with Re,
are they direct qualifiers of the Maruts? I opt for the first solution because vedhásdoes not usually govern anything and because Rudra is called ásuro mahó diváḥ in
II.1.6, divó ásurāya in V.41.3, and probably diváh &hellip; ásurasya in I.122.1 contra Ge.
And in fact is vedhásaḥ nom. pl., as it’s universally taken, or another gen. sg.,
perhaps qualifying Rudra? Parallels cut both ways. Rudra is in fact called vedhás- in
VII.46.1, but the Maruts are so called in V.52.13, 54.6.</p>
<h3 id="viii2018">VIII.20.18</h3>
<p>Syntactic problems continue in this verse. Contra most interpr., I take ab
as a continuation of vs. 17, still couched in the 3rd ps., and cd as a new clause directly
addressing the Maruts in the 2nd ps. The first hemistich consists of two parallel
relative clauses, with the two forms of yé positioned at the extreme ends, opening and
closing the half-verse. The clauses are connected by an inverse ca: #yé ca … yé#.
This inversion is phonologically motivated, producing a mirror image figure: #yé
cā́rhanti … cáranti yé# (Saṃhitā text, but 1st verb metrically to be read ca árhanti).
There are further problems. árhanti has no expressed object &ndash; unless marútaḥ
is taken as acc., with the subj. being unexpressed human worshipers; see Old’s reff.
This seems a thoroughly bad idea, given the rhetorical structure of this pragātha. Ge
supplies “zu heissen” (that is, “deserve [to be called]”), which seems a fairly radical
addition; Re “notre hommage” (so also Klein, DGRV I.186), which is somewhat
easier to justify semantically but for which there is no parallel. My “soma drink” is
based on a number of passages where some expression containing pītím ‘drink’ (+/-
‘soma’) serves as obj. of √arh (I.134.6, II.14.2, IV.47.2, V.51.6); this is the most
common expressed obj. to √arh.
In b mīḷhúṣaḥ is the problem. Technically speaking, this cannot be a nom. pl.
as I have rendered it. The correct form should be mīḷhvā́ṃsaḥ, which is found only
once in the RV, though nearby (VIII.25.14, but not attributed to the same poet). Most
take it here as the accusative pl. it appeas to be, referring to the generous (human)
patrons whom the Maruts approach (e.g., Ge “und die zu den Lohnherrn
insgesamt(?) kommen”). This is certainly possible, but, with Old, I nonetheless take
it as a nominative, because the stem is often used of the Maruts, including in this
very hymn (3c gen. pl. mīḷhúṣām). The misinterpretation could be aided by passages
like VI.66.3 rudrásya yé mīḍhúṣaḥ sánti putrā́ḥ, where the adjective technically
modifies gen. sg. Rudra, but could be interpr. as going with nom. pl. putrā́ḥ. Cf. also
VII.58.5, which is entirely ambiguous. It is indeed barely possible that mīḷhúṣaḥ here
actually is a gen. sg., picking up the rudrásya of 17a, but I think this unlikely. The
morphologically weak nom. pl. here might also be favored by phonological
motivations, in order to produce a form similar to marútaḥ in the previous pāda in
the same metrical position (i.e., immediately preceding a four-syllable cadence).
yúvānaḥ here is a voc.; the identical form in 17c is most likely a nominative.
The acc. to the same stem, yū́naḥ, opens the next vs. (19a).
In d the Saṃhitā vavṛdhvam must be read *vavṛd-dhu
vam with both distraction
and a heavy root syllable (√vṛt ‘turn’). For a similar situation, see ácidhvam in
VIII.7.2, which must be read *ácid-dhu
vam (√cit).</p>
<h3 id="viii2019">VIII.20.19</h3>
<p>As was pointed out in the publ. intro., pāda c contains a pun: the intens.
part. cárkṛṣat can belong straightforwardly to √kṛṣ ‘plough’, and in this reading the
simile depicts a person engaged in ploughing singing or otherwise verbally
encouraging his team, just as Sobhari sings to the Maruts. (In this case gā́ḥ would
probably be better rendered “oxen.”) But it can also be secondarily associated with
the root √kṝ ‘celebrate, praise’, which has a curiously formed 3rd sg. -se medial
intensive cárkṛṣe (3x), beside act. carkar-/carkir-. For purposes of word play a nonce
stem cárkṛṣ- could be extracted from the isolated cárkṛṣe. In this reading Sobhari is
praising the Maruts like cows (see vs. 21); in other words this is a sort of reverse
dānastuti. That the Maruts are called bulls in pāda b simply adds to the play.
Note also the phonological echo in gā́ya gā́(ḥ).</p>
<h3 id="viii2020">VIII.20.20</h3>
<p>Ge plausibly explains the sg. hávyaḥ as attraction to the number in the
simile (sg. muṣṭihā́). One might also add that hávya- is overwhelmingly nom. sg, and
there are no masc. pl. forms attested. There seems no obvious reason for such a
grammatical restriction, but it may have contributed to the somewhat anomalous
form here.
All standard interpr. (including mine) take the simile in b to be vṛ́ṣṇaś
candrā́n ná “like lustrous bulls,” despite the displaced simile marker &ndash; in part
presumably because “like lustrous/brilliant ones” doesn’t make much sense as a
simile. I have no explanation for the placement of ná, nor do I understand why this
needs to be a simile at all, since the Maruts are regularly called bulls without such
marking (see nearby 19b, e.g., as well as 9–10, 12). Perhaps it indirectly continues
the pun in the simile in 19c, which in turn is continued in vs. 21.</p>
<h3 id="viii2021">VIII.20.21</h3>
<p>The cow imagery of vs. 19 (and implicitly 20) continues here. Ge and Re
take this as a simile (“like cows”), but this requires interpr. cid as a simile marker, a
function for cid that I do not believe in. It is even less likely because the next verse
begins with a parallel structure (mártaś cid), where the cid is definitely not a simile
marker. I do, however, think that the Maruts are identified with the cows here. There
are several themes intertwined. The most obvious point of comparison between cows
and Maruts is their common birth (sajātyèna … sábandhavaḥ) as a herd/flock and
consequent lack of individual differentiation, a characteristic of the Maruts treated
earlier, in vss. 13–14. But the Maruts also have a cow for a mother; this was asserted
in 8c, and the phraseology there (góbandhavaḥ sujātā́saḥ “akin to a cow, well-born”)
is echoed here (gā́vaḥ … sajātyèna … sábandhavaḥ), thus alluding to the Maruts’
kinship with cows. Hence sábandhu- here has two senses: both cows and Maruts
have common birth within their own group (that is, cows with cows, Maruts with
Maruts), but cows and Maruts have a common birth with each other (cows with
Maruts, due to the Maruts’ bovine mother). This type of kinship is treated also in
22ab. I also identified a secondary meaning in 8c: being akin to cows is a way of
saying that the Maruts have cows to give, and I think that is slightly hinted at here.
I don’t quite understand the relevance of “they lick each other’s humps.” Lü
(Varuṇa 90) suggests that the vs. praises the unity (Eintract) of the Maruts, and, if
somewhat sharpened, this may be the correct explanation. “Lick each other’s humps”
may be the equivalent of English “watch each other’s backs”: individuals act
reciprocally (mitháḥ here) and protectively for the common good of the group.
Note the echo of the final words in a and b: … samanyavaḥ# …
sábandhavaḥ#. The opening gā́vaś cid ghā also faintly echoes gā́ya gā́opening 21a.</p>
<h3 id="viii2022">VIII.20.22</h3>
<p>The theme of cross-species kinship in vs. 21 continues here, with the
mortal seeking brotherhood (bhrātṛtvám) with the Maruts.
The verse as a whole, balancing brotherhood (bhrātṛtvám) and friendship
(āptivám), should be evaluated in conjunction with vs. 13 of the next hymn (VIII.21,
by the same poet) abhrātrvy̥ ó anā́tvám, ánāpir indra janúṣā sanā́d asi / yudhéd
āpitvám ichase, where Indra is said to lack either. See comm. thereon.</p>
<h3 id="viii2023">VIII.20.23</h3>
<p>bheṣajásya appears to be a partitive genitive.</p>
<h3 id="viii2024">VIII.20.24</h3>
<p>Note the relatively elementary figure in c máyo (no) bhūta …
mayobhuvaḥ.
The voc. asacadviṣaḥ has given rise to multiple competing analyses, well
summarized by Scar in his detailed treatment of this hapax (246–48). Most start with
dviṣ- ‘hatred, hater’ as 2nd member and some form of √sac ‘follow, accompany’ as
its first, governing the second. The problem is what form of √sac? It cannot be a
straighforward thematic verbal stem or participle/injunctive (saca- or sacat- [though
*asacad-dviṣaḥ is a phonologically possible underlying form]) because the Class I
pres. of √sac is resolutely middle. (Debrunner [Nachtr. AiG II.1.87] also disputes
this analysis on the basis that the accent is wrong for a verbal governing cmpd of that
sort, but since the form is a voc. and unaccented, this argument is inapplicable. [It
does apply to the other form he mentions, jaradvíṣ-, but these forms do not have to
be parallel.]) It is also possible to take it as a standard type of root noun cmpd with
the root noun governing the 1st member (‘hating the asaca’ or ‘not hating the saca’;
at some point I toyed with the idea of ‘hating the non-aligned’), but this still founders
on the puzzle of asaca-. Scar’s own solution is to divide the cmpd differently, as
asacad-víṣ-, with √viṣ ‘bring about’ as 2nd member and a form of √sac (2) ‘dry out’
as 1st member, hence ‘not bringing about drought’ or ‘bringing about non-drought’.
Unfortunately getting -sacat- from this root requires a lot of not too plausible
machinery &ndash; it is no more straightforward than deriving -saca(t)- from √sac (1) &ndash;
though I am sympathetic to his argument that the meaning would fit well with the
Maruts’ character. My own ‘who do not partner hatred’ rests essentially on a loose
interpr. of the verbal governing analysis presented first above, though I hold no
particular brief for it. I would point out that if it does contain √sac ‘accompany’, it
could pair contrastively with sakhāyaḥ in the preceding vs. (23c). A very weak
argument for √sac (1) and √dviṣ could be constructed on the basis of VIII.22.2, a
hymn to the Aśvins but also composed by Sobhari. There the Aśvins’ chariot is
described as sacanā́vantam ‘provided with companions’ vel sim., the first word of
pāda c, and as vídveṣasam ‘free of hatred’, the first word of pāda d, with the same
two roots. But I would not make much of this.</p>

<p>dhṛṣát is ordinarily an adverb, originally probably the neut. of a VIth class
present of which there are no finite forms – except, possibly, this one. The relative
pronoun yáḥ invites dhṛṣát to be read as a 3rd sg. injunctive (and of course in a
relative clause its accent would be correct). I would suggest that either the neut. part.
dhṛṣát has been misanalyzed and pressed into service as a finite form or that yáḥ is
serving as a loose izafe connecting this adverbial qualifier with the subject.
On metrically bad vavṛmahe, see comm. ad Kü (459) and comm. ad VI.4.7.
Old suggests that the “youth” is King Citra, whose dānastuti ends the hymn.
This seems perfectly plausible but nonetheless unprovable.</p>
<h3 id="viii214-1">VIII.21.4</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. should have a close parens after “[horses, etc.].”
I interpret this verse in the context of its pragātha. The question is who are the
kin that Indra has and we do not. I suggest that Indra’s “kin” are the horses, cows,
and so forth named in vs. 3. In VIII.68.19 the patrons are called vā́ja-bandhu-
‘having prizes as kin’, as a hint that they should give them to us. I think the same
image is at work here: we lack kin, and you have these desirable kin (horses, etc.)
that could become akin to us too.
In the second hemistich these kin become dhā́māni. The stem dhā́man- is of
course a highly charged and multivalent word, but in this case I think it comes close
to its literal sense: ‘deposits’, that is, things put or set down (√dhā), which Indra is to
bring to deposit on the ritual ground.</p>
<h3 id="viii215-1">VIII.21.5</h3>
<p>A verse that makes less sense the more one thinks about it, since the bird
simile does not seem to fit the context: birds don&rsquo;t normally sit either next to or in
honey, nor do they normally roar. The simile must have as its third term “in a nest”
or “in a tree” (cf. dru-ṣád(van) several times of birds) as the parallel to the loc. honey
phrase.</p>
<h3 id="viii216-1">VIII.21.6</h3>
<p>In pāda a ca must have subordinating value because of the accent on

<p>The first pāda, in the accusative, continues 9c, hanging off índram there.
The second pāda may be attached to the first, as Ge takes it, or to cd, as I take it.
There are no strong arguments either way, but I assume the causal clause in b
grounds the expectations we have in cd: because he has reached exhilaration with us
(this last bit unexpressed), he will provide for us.</p>
<h3 id="viii2111">VIII.21.11</h3>
<p>The image in this verse is of a contest for cattle, where a competitor
challenges us (ancient trash talk) and we can successfully respond, thanks to having
Indra as our ally. The word qualifying the competitor, śvasánt- ‘snorting’, calls to
mind Indra’s enemy Śuṣṇa (on the etymological connection see EWA s.v. śúṣṇa-)
and therefore makes our human competition sound more formidable.</p>
<h3 id="viii2112">VIII.21.12</h3>
<p>Continues the thought of vs. 11, that with Indra on our side we can take
on all challenges and challengers. I therefore tr. the 1st pl. optatives as potential “we
could” rather than the voluntative “might we” (Ge “wir wollen”). The 2nd sg. verb
aveḥ in d does not work well in this schema, at least in its ordinary interpretation as
an optative to the 1st class pres. of √av ‘help’. Although “you should / might you help
our visions” is possible, esp. given that dhī́- is not infrequently the object of √av (cf.,
e.g., I.117.23 víśvā dhíyaḥ … prā́vatam me), I have taken it instead as the imperfect
of the root pres. of √vī ‘pursue’. Although ‘thought, vision’ is not a regular object of
√vī, it does occur; cf. I.77.4 agnír gírò &lsquo;vasā vetu dhītím “let Agni with his help
pursue our hymns, our visionary thought” (note the presence of ávasā ‘help’ as well).
This aveḥ would pick up the subjunctive vayati of 10c, also with Indra as subject,
also performing this action in our service, and the visions he pursues here are those
announced in 6d. I interpret the word dhī́- in both places as referring to our fantasies
about what we want out of Indra and how we could be victorious. In 12 Indra seems
to have fulfilled these fantasies. Against the interpretation of aveḥ as belonging to
√av we might note that the optative to the extremely well-attested thematic present
ávati is almost non-existent. If the form here is otherwise analysed, the only secure
form is avet in VI.47.15; ávet in V.34.8 I also take to √vī. However, I do not consider
the standard interpretation of áveḥ here as belonging to √av entirely excluded.</p>
<h3 id="viii2113">VIII.21.13</h3>
<p>The use of bhrā́tṛvya-, lit. ‘nephew, cousin’, as ‘rival’ is exceedingly
common in Vedic prose, but only really begins in the AV; this is the only such
example in the RV. The passage here seems to be an expansion, with lexical renewal,
of I.102.8 aśatrúr indra janúṣā sanād asi “You are without rival, Indra, by birth from
of old,” but I would also suggest that the use of an explicit kinship term a-bhrātṛvyá
(as opposed to the generic a-śatrú-) is deliberate, given the web of relationships the
poet develops in this hymn (see publ. intro.) It is possible that -bhrātṛvya- here is
meant to be taken in both the negative sense that is standard later (rival &lt; rivalrous
nephew/cousin) and in a positive one, simply naming a blood relation. Thus the
hemistich could mean both “you have no nephew and no friend” and “you have no
rival but no friend”). As a kinship term abhrātṛvyá- would contrast with the
bándhumant- of 4a, where Indra is explicitly credited with having kin.</p>
<h3 id="viii2114">VIII.21.14</h3>
<p>The motivation for some of these statements needs some explication. The
first hemistich concerns two negative figures; the second one, in pāda b, the man who
swells up on surā, the secular and disreputable drink &ndash; in other words a drunk, a lush,
or in Ge’s felicitous tr. “die Schnappshelden” &ndash; is implicitly contrasted with a man
who handles the much-honored drink soma in a ritual context. But why should a rich
man (pāda a) be disfavored? Perhaps because he has what he needs and need not
enter into partnership with Indra, whereas we, more needy, are willing to engage in
the reciprocal activities involved in honoring Indra. I reluctantly abandoned my tr. of
revántam- as ‘fat cat’, primarily because revánt- is not usually used in slangy
contexts.
I’m afraid that I don’t understand the second hemistich at all, primarily
because I don’t know whether the omitted object of sám ūhasi should be the negative
figures of ab or positively or neutrally viewed humans in general. The sentiment of
pāda d would support the latter idea: that when Indra enters into battle, he puts
everyone together (under his protection), thereby behaving like a father. But the only
other instance of sám √ūh (I.131.3), also with Indra as subject, has him shoving the
two opposing sides into fighting each other, with a come-what-may attitude. This
seems more likely here, in which case pāda d would express the opposing sides’
competing calls to Indra to help them.</p>
<h3 id="viii2115">VIII.21.15</h3>
<p>Again the cultural content here is somewhat elusive and therefore the
relation of the simile to the frame not entirely clear. The woman who grows old at
home (amājúr-) must be a spinster (see II.17.7 for the clearest context of this word),
but what aspect of her activity we wish to avoid isn’t defined. It may simply be that
we should not sit still and inactive at the soma sacrifice when we should be busying
ourselves serving Indra. (Although one wonders whether an ancient Indian spinster
was allowed just to sit around, rather than being a virtual servant to her parents and
the rest of the extended family. I would think she’d be busy enough.) Or perhaps
there is a pun embedded in ní √sad; in later Sanskrit this lexeme can mean ‘sink
down (mentally), be depressed’ and so perhaps it’s the spinster’s mental state that’s
at issue. It is even possible, if we read this verse with its pragātha partner, vs. 16, to
take “let us not miss out…” of 16a as a gloss on what aspect of the spinster’s life we
wish to avoid in 15: she missed out on marriage, but we do not want to miss out on
Indra’s gifts.</p>
<h3 id="viii2116">VIII.21.16</h3>
<p>The connection between pādas a and b must be that were we to miss out
on Indra’s gifts, we would be likely to complain about him.
On d see Scar 196. Ge’s “Gaben” cannot be right for dāmā́naḥ, which should
be a personal designation; see Scar’s “die Geschenke machen / Geschenke
bekommen.” Perhaps like somā́nam (I.18.1) it contains a Hoffmann suffix.</p>
<h3 id="viii2117">VIII.21.17</h3>
<p>There is no overt question marker, but the verse works better with vs. 18
as a series of deliberative questions, to be answered by the emphatic declaration of
Citra’s preeminence in 18.</p>
<h3 id="viii2118">VIII.21.18</h3>
<p>The clustering of demotic ka-forms in dānastutis (see Jamison 2008,
2009) is nicely illustrated by rājakā́íd anyaké, yaké, with the suffix even attached to
the relative pronoun.
tatánat must be a pun on the two roots √tan ‘thunder’ and ‘stretch’. See Old.
Parjanya of course thunders, but he also stretches through the midspace with his rain.
Citra will likewise both make a big noise and extend his largesse.</p>
<h2 id="viii22-aśvins">VIII.22 Aśvins</h2>
<p>Esp. towards the end of the hymn, pāda-initial (C)ā becomes an insistent
marker: ā́(8c, 9a), yā́(bhiḥ) (10a, b), tā́(bhiḥ) (10c, 12a), yā́(bhiḥ) (12d), tā́(u) (13a, b,
c, 14a, b), mā́(14c), ā́(15a), prā(tā́) (15b), ā(rā́ttāc) (16c), ā́(17a). The most
concentrated sequence is in vss. 13–14 with the repeated dual prn. tā́(u) ‘these two’,
referring to the Aśvins.
VIII.22.1–2: This pragātha contains poetic self-address at a distance. Vs. 1 begins ā́
… have “I have called here …,” while 2c ends with the voc. sobhare. (On poetic selfaddress see Jamison [Fs. Skjaervø, 2009].)</p>
<h3 id="viii222">VIII.22.2</h3>
<p>The reading of the first word of this vs. is uncertain. The Saṃhitā text
apparently reads pūrvāyúṣam but the Pp. pūrva-āpúṣam, accepted by Sāy as well as
Old and edited in all the standard editions (MM, Aufr., HvN). This seems to be a
genuine variant reading. For disc. see Old ad loc. and Scar 320–22. I generally
follow the Old analysis for the 2nd member; the objection that with a 2nd member
āyuṣ- the accent should be *pūrvā́yuṣam or *pūrvāyuṣám seems cogent to me. But I
have not adopted Old’s suggestion that pūrva- stands for *puru- (hence ‘prospering
many’, vel sim.), with the ū introduced under the influence of pū́rvyam at the end of
the hemistich. This is not impossible, but since puru-spṛ́ham intervenes, it might
have helped maintain an original *puru- in the initial word. Scar suggests several
further analyses, which seem too fussy to me.
sacanā́vant- is construed with the instr. sumatíbhiḥ: “provided with favors as
accompaniment.”</p>
<h3 id="viii224">VIII.22.4</h3>
<p>For īrmā́‘at rest, standing still’, contra Gr ‘rasch’, etc., Ge ‘zurück’, see
Narten IIJ 10 (1967–68) and EWA s.v.
iṣaṇyá- is ordinarily transitive, so I take vām as its obj. (so also Gr), contra Ge
and Re. This must be a paradox: the motionless chariot wheel is the one that propels
them, not the speedy one in pāda a. I do not have a vision of how this would work in
practice, though.</p>

<p>Although ádhrigu- is simply a -u-stem, the negated form of Aves. drigu-
‘poor’ (see comm. ad I.61.1), in the nom. pl. it is treated as if it were a cmpd. with
‘cow’, with ádhrigāvaḥ (also I.64.3) instead of expected *ádhrigavaḥ (see AiG
III.158). But things may be more complicated, for, as Gr notes, in I.61.1 the dat.
ádhrigave would be better metrically as *ádhrigāve. In this case it does not match the
‘cow’ word, whose dative is gáve. However, Wackernagel (AiG III.149) considers an
emendation to -gāve unnecessary and refers to Old (Prol. 90 and Noten ad loc.) for
the meter. It’s also possible that I.61.1 just borrowed the length from I.64.3, both
Nodhas products, because the stem was not entirely understood.</p>
<h3 id="viii2212">VIII.22.12</h3>
<p>On viśvápsu- see comm. ad I.148.1.
Old explains 3rd pl. vāvṛdhúḥ as metri causa for du. *vāvṛdháthuḥ, and this is
accepted by Ge. But the only other passage in which krívi- is found as a clear PN
(though cf. V.44.4, VIII.51.8 [Vālakh.], IX.9.6 for more dubious exx.) is in a nearby
Sobhari hymn, in which he is favored by the Maruts (VIII.20.24 yā́bhir daśasyathā
krívim “with which you favor Krivi”). The yā́bhiḥ there has the same referent as here,
namely ūtíbhiḥ ‘forms of help’ and vāvṛdhúḥ is a semantic variant of daśasyathā. I
therefore think it very likely that the plural verb is correct and that this is an allusion
to the Maruts’ aid to Krivi. Recall that in vs. 1c, at least by my interpr., the Aśvins
also follow the Maruts’ lead, also and identically 14b, and they are addressed as
Rudras (that is, Maruts) in 14c.</p>
<h3 id="viii2215">VIII.22.15</h3>
<p>The vs. begins with an echo of the first vs., or rather the first pragātha, in
which the poet called on the Aśvins’ chariot (1a ó tyám ahva ā́rátham), here reprised
by ā́… súgmyam … / huvé “I call the easily moving (chariot).” But in pāda b the
poet thinks better of it and addresses the Aśvins directly. This change of heart is
signalled by vā ‘or’.
Ge, flg. Sāy, takes sakṣáṇī to √sac ‘accompany’, but as Re points out, all
other forms of sakṣáṇi- (incl. those separated by Gr into a separate lemma derived
from √sac) belong to √sah, and this etymon works fine here.
The echo of the first pragātha continues with the poet’s self-identification as
sóbharī at the end of the verse, echoing his self-address with voc. sobhare at the end
of 2c. sóbharī here is one of two occurrences of this PN that have apparently fem.
endings (the other is gen. sg. sóbharyāḥ in VIII.103.14). Ge questioning suggests that
we might be dealing with a female poet, but this seems highly unlikely, esp. given
the voc. sobhare in vs. 2 and elsewhere in this group of hymns (VIII.19.2, 20.19).

<h3 id="viii232">VIII.23.2</h3>
<p>With Ge I take ab as a continuation of vs. 1, with c starting a new clause.
The vocc. in ab are the self-address of the poet, as in VIII.22.1–2. Here the poet first
exhorts himself with 2nd ps. imperatives (1ab) and then switches to a pseudo-modal
1st ps. -se in c. The first voc. viśvacarṣaṇe (2a) is a bit of a red herring, since this
stem is otherwise used of gods. But he addresses and thus identifies himself with his
speaking name Viśvamanas in b, making it clear that he was simply appropriating the
divine epithet for himself.
I supply váhnīn to govern ráthānām in c, on the basis of váhniḥ in 3c and
váhnī ráthānām in VIII.94.1. I surmise that this is also Re’s thinking behind
“(comme conducteurs) des chars,” though he makes no comment.</p>
<h3 id="viii233-1">VIII.23.3</h3>
<p>Ge (n. 3c) takes upavídā … vindate as simply equivalent to upavindate,
which is esp. puzzling because úpa is not otherwise construed with √vid in the RV.
My ‘close’ in the tr. ‘close searching’ is meant to convey the intimate nuance of this
preverb.
Note the v alliteration in c: upavídā váhnir vindate vásu.</p>
<h3 id="viii235">VIII.23.5</h3>
<p>I take abhikhyā́in the sense of ‘glance’ rather than ‘appearance’ (as Gr, Re,
and Scar 99 do). The finite forms of abhí √khyā all have the meaning ‘look at’, as do
the 2 occurrences of the gerund abhikhyā́ya (I.155.5, II.30.9). abhikhyā́occurs 3
times (here + I.148.5, X.112.10, all compatible with a meaning ‘glance’ [pace Gr]). It
may either be the instr. sg. of a root noun or (with AiG II.2.782) a haplologized form
of the gerund abhikhyā́ya. Both possibilities are considered by Scar (98–99).</p>
<h3 id="viii236-1">VIII.23.6</h3>
<p>Contra most interpr., I take Agni as driving to the gods to present them
with our praises as well as our oblations, rather than coming here (e.g., Re “arrive
avec les belles louanges”).
The impv. yāhí is accented because it follows an initial voc.</p>
<h3 id="viii239-1">VIII.23.9</h3>
<p>Both Ge and Re explicitly identify the subj. of jujuṣuḥ in c as those
seeking truth (voc. ṛtāyavaḥ), the human ritualists addressed in a. Although switch
between 2nd and 3rd ps. even within a verse is not rare, I think the gods are the more
likely subject, as they generally are to forms of √juṣ. This verse depicts the ritual
model whereby Agni brings the gods to the ritual ground to receive oblations, with
this location specified by námasas padé &ndash; in contrast to vs. 6, where Agni conveys
the oblations and praises to the gods (presumably in heaven), the other model of
sacrificial interaction.</p>
<h3 id="viii2316">VIII.23.16</h3>
<p>The point of this verse seems to be that Vyaśva (the poet&rsquo;s father) got the
goods, either directly from Agni or via the patron Ukṣan, and we hope this will
provide a pattern for us.
The grammatically disharmonious phrase mahó rāyé would better be tr.
“greatly for wealth.” See disc. ad IV.31.11.
VIII.23.18–19: Just as vs. 16 provides an ancestral pattern for the poet to gain goods
from Agni and/or his patron, these vss. take the gods’ establishment of Agni as their
messenger as the prototype for mortals’ doing the same.</p>

<h3 id="viii2324">VIII.23.24</h3>
<p>The hapax sthūrayūpavát may be a pun. On the one hand, formations of
this sort, with neut. -vát suffix, generally mean ‘like X’, ‘as X did’, with X a PN. The
presence of an undoubted ex. in the same position in the immediately preceding vs.,
vyaśvavát ‘like Vyaśva’, strongly supports this interpr. The poet addressed by the
impv. arca is being urged to chant ‘like Sthūrayūpa’. Gr and Re interpr. the form
thus. But sthūrayūpa- also has lexical meaning, ‘(having?) sturdy posts’ (in the
absence of accent we cannot tell whether the cmpd is a bahuvrīhi or a karmadhāraya).
The yūpa is both the post to which the animal to be sacrificed is tethered and a
crucial post or beam in the construction of dwellings. In this lexical meaning the
comparison could either be between the praise songs and sturdy posts or someone
who possesses them, or between Agni and the post or post-possessor. Note that it is
Agni dámya- (‘of the household’) who receives the chant. If the comparison is to the
praise songs, they would be conceptualized as the uprights that help make the house
solid. The parallel adduced by Ge, I.51.14 … stómo dúryo ná yū́paḥ “a praise-song
like a door-post,” is particularly apt. This is the sense reflected in my tr. and also in
Ge’s and assumes a karmadhāraya. If the comparison is to Agni, a bahuvrīhi would
be better: “to Agni of the household, like one [=a house] having sturdy posts.” The
kinship asserted between Agni and trees in the next verse may give some support to
this last interpr.</p>
<h3 id="viii2326">VIII.23.26</h3>
<p>The syntax of this vs. is very difficult; Re even suggests that it consists of
fragments “non syntaxisés” &ndash; a coinage I would like to introduce to English. The
standard interpr. take the NP in pāda a as acc. pl., more (Old) or less (Ge) parallel to
havyā́ni in b and then either supply a verb to govern them (Ge: “bring [X to Y]”) or
cobble together a very implausible syntactic bond between the verb ní satsi in c and
the accusatives in ab (e.g., Re “En direction de tous &hellip; assieds toi”). I take a very
different route, first by interpr. maháḥ … satáḥ not as acc. pl. but gen./abl. sg. This
phrase seems to have some special status: cf. I.36.3 mahás te satáḥ “since you are
great,” same phrase in VIII.101.11 “of you who are great.” I take the referent of the
abl./gen. phrase to be Agni, and I also interpr. abhí ṣatáḥ in the usual idiomatic
meaning of abhí √as ‘be superior to’, construed here with the acc. víśvān. In b I
simply supply a different form of the root √as, namely santu, to be construed with
the abhí in the same meaning. The point of the sentence is that since Agni, who is
superior to everything, is our Hotar and the conduit of our offerings to the gods, our
oblations cannot help being superior as well.</p>

<p>The poet of this group of hymns (VIII.23–26) is Viśvamanas, but
viśvámanasaḥ here can be read both literally and as the PN. Note also the cross-tṛca
echo, 6c mánaḥ / 7a -manasaḥ, and the initial figure víśvāni viśvá-, which together
make up the poet’s name.</p>

<p>The opening word of c, váso, is read as vásoḥ by the Pp., followed by Old
and Ge – that is, with the loss of underlying final -s before the cluster sp- &ndash; hence a
gen. sg. belonging with the long gen. sg. noun phrase ending with rā́dhasaḥ. This is
of course possible, but the presence of undoubted voc. vaso in 7c in a hymn that is
over-partial to vocatives and given to repetitions across verses, supports a voc.

<p>A verse full of figures: mahāmaha, mahé (ab), dṛḷháś cid dṛhya (c),
maghavan magháttaye. There is also an inter-tṛca echo between voc. nṛto (9b) and
voc. nṛtama (10b), with nṛto returning in 12a.</p>
<h3 id="viii2414">VIII.24.14</h3>
<p>The expression dákṣam pṛñcántam is somewhat peculiar, and Ge takes
the two words as separate qualifiers of Indra: “dem Verständigen, Spendenden.”
However, I.141.1 bhágaṃ dákṣaṃ ná papr̥cāsi suggests that dákṣam should be the
object of the pres. participle. By the tr. “engorging skill” I mean that Indra fills his
latent quality (skill) with energy (perhaps derived from soma and praise) and makes
it available to use.
Acdg. to the Anukramaṇī, our poet Viśvamanas has the patronymic Vaiyaśva
(vs. 23), that is, son of Vyaśva (‘without horses’), and the poet mentions his family in
vss. 22, 28–29 with the distracted stem vi
yaśva-. But in this verse he refers to himself
instead as aśvi
yá-, also distracted, which, on the one hand, is simply an anagram of
the family name with the first two syllables reversed, but, on the other, credits him
with possession of (or at least relationship to) horses, whereas the unmetathesized
version announces him as horse-less.</p>

<p>On the lexeme yújyāya √vṝ see comm. ad IX.88.1.
The expression naíváthā (that is, ná eváthā), placed between the two

indra tvád úttaraḥ .. .nákir evā́yáthā tvám “There is no one higher than you, Indra …
no one who is exactly as you are,” and our eváthā appears almost to be a blend of evā́

<p>I supply siñcá from b as the verb also of a, and supply madíntaram of a
as the object of b, with ándhasaḥ dependent on it as mádhvaḥ is in a. Ge by contrast
(fld. by Klein DGRV II.183) supplies “bring” in a and takes ándhasaḥ as a partitive
genitive in b. This is not impossible, but my interpretation requires less extraneous
material.
Another cross-tṛca connection: evā́in c echoes eváthā in 15c. More cleverly,
16ab éd u m(ádhvo)… siñcá picks up 13a éndum … siñcata (note that édum and
éndum are almost identical).</p>

<p>The a pāda is repeated twice elsewhere in VIII: 81.4, 95.7. The reason for
the accent on stávāma, which does not begin the pāda and probably not its clause, is
unclear, though it may well be connected with its relationship with the exhortative 2nd
pl. impv. éta “come on!” It would, in fact, be possible to construe índram with éta nú
and begin a new clause with stávāma (“Come now to Indra; let us praise the superior
man…”), but this seems unnatural. It is curious that Old does not comment on the
accent here or in the other passages.</p>
<h3 id="viii2422">VIII.24.22</h3>
<p>Here as elsewhere (II.5.1, III.27.3, both with pl. vājínaḥ) yámam governs

<p>A very cute pun, with návam meaning, as often in a hymnal context,
‘anew’, but in conjunction with daśamám ‘tenth’ evoking náva ‘nine’.
caráṇi- is a hapax, but most likely derived from the root √car ‘wander’ (see
EWA s.v. CARI
, though AiG II.2.207 considers it of unclear meaning). It must have
been created to contrast semantically with the very frequent near-rhyme form
carṣaṇí- ‘settled/boundaried peoples’, whose gen. pl. carṣaṇīnā́m occurs 35x in the
RV, always at the end of the pāda as here (including VIII.23.7 hótāram carṣaṇīnā́m,
the adjacent hymn by the same poet). That the short initial syllable of caráṇīnām
produces a bad cadence surely draws more attention to the word it was created in
opposition to.</p>
<h3 id="viii2425">VIII.24.25</h3>
<p>Elliptical and with some syntactic puzzles. See Old on the verse in
general and the multiple solutions proposed in earlier lit.
In b I supply “be there” as the verb; Ge, to more or less the same effect,
“beistandest.”
In c I supply Śuṣṇa as the object of both verbs, since he is the demon Indra
ordinarily slays for Kutsa. The problem here is that the verbs are not parallel:
injunctive śiśnathaḥ followed by imperative ní codaya. Somewhat reluctantly I
ascribe imperatival value to śiśnathaḥ (so also Ge without comment), possible
because of the functional shape-shifting ability of injunctives. (See the same form in
VIII.70.10.) However, I am not certain how often regular injunctives can show
imperatival value, as opposed to lexicalized forms like dā́ḥ and dhā́ḥ. The root √cud
does not otherwise appear with ní, a fact that makes its value here even less clear. Ge
supplies “horses” as object, while Old suggests importing ávaḥ ‘help’ from a.</p>
<h3 id="viii2426">VIII.24.26</h3>
<p>Again elliptical. In ab the semantic opposition between new and old is
obviously the point, but what new thing are we begging Indra for? Ge supplies “deed”
(“… eine (Tat), die auch dem Älteste neu ist”). In III.31.19 the same expression
návyam … sányase refers to the making of a new hymn, but it makes no sense to beg
Indra for a new hymn. I tentatively supply ā́yuḥ ‘life’, which occurs several times
with návyam (I.10.11, III.53.16, VII.80.2). The other occurrence of návyaṃ sanyasé
(VIII.67.18) is found immediately after a periphrastic causative “you make live”
(VIII.67.17c dévāḥ kṛṇuthá jīváse), and a “new life” works reasonably well in that
passage. But this is all circumstantial, and I do not know why such a wish would be
expressed here, beyond the usual Vedic desire to live a full and vigorous lifetime.
The sá tvám in c does not conform to the rules for 2nd ps. sá reference
developed in Jamison 1992. I would therefore prefer to supply an imperative “(be)
victorious …,” which would, I think, also fit the context better. However, the
offending sá might be explained by the 3rd ps. verb (mucát) in the following verse
(27ab), whose relative clauses hang off 26c, in my view. In other words, the
construction of the whole sentence fluctuates between 2nd and 3rd ps. subject.
VII.24.27: As noted just above, I take the relative clauses in ab as hanging off 26c.
Both Ge and Old make 27bc into a single clause, but the verb in c (nīnamaḥ) is
unaccented although b begins with a relative pronoun yáḥ. I therefore take ab as
being two parallel relative clauses sharing a single verb mucát; cleverly the poet has
exploited the fact that √muc participates in two different syntactic constructions with
accusative and ablative: “release ROPE vel sim. [acc.] from VICTIM [abl.]” and
“release VICTIM [acc.] from ROPE [abl.].” (Perhaps not surprisingly, English has the
same two constructions.) In 27a we find the first, though without overt expression of
the VICTIM (=us or perhaps the Ārya); cf., e.g., X.97.15 tā́no muñcantu áṃhasaḥ. In
b we find the second, though without overt expression of the ROPE. Here I supply
áṃhaḥ adapted from abl. áṃhasaḥ in pāda a. Cf. IV.12.6=X.126.8 evó ṣv àsmán [i.e.,
asmát] muñcata vy áṃhaḥ.</p>
<h3 id="viii2429">VIII.24.29</h3>
<p>The adj. somínaḥ can of course be either abl.-gen. sg. or nom.-acc. pl. It
shares a pāda with acc. vyàśvān, so proximity favors taking it with that noun – as in
the publ. tr. (also Ge). However, Sāy. takes it with gen. nāryásya in the previous pāda,
and he may be correct. Nārya appears to be the (or one) name of the patron of the
sacrifice, the dispenser of the dakṣiṇā to the poets, and it would make sense to refer
to him as possessing or providing soma. I would therefore entertain the alternative tr.
“ let the priestly gift of Nārya, provider of soma, come to the Vyaśvas.”</p>
<h3 id="viii2430">VIII.24.30</h3>
<p>In contrast to the first two fairly straightforward verses of the dānastuti
(28–29), this one bristles with slangy jokes and their attendant puzzles. It is also the
only verse in the hymn not in Uṣṇih meter. The verse opens with the sacrificer
(ījānáḥ, lit. the pf. mid. participle to √yaj) asking “you” an abrupt question kuhayā́
kuhayākṛte, consisting of an extended form of kúha ‘where’ (the extended form
found only here) and an oddly formed, nonce vocative made up of the same adverbial
interrogative plus (probably) -kṛti- (though -kṛtā- would also be possible). Judging
from vs. 28, the beginning of the dānastuti, which contains a vocative addressed to
Dawn, she is also the addressee here, though a reversion to the default Indra is
certainly not excluded. So, literally, “where? you where-actor.” Ge takes ījānáḥ as
the subject of the question (“where is the sacrificer?”), rather than the questioner. I
follow Old: “Die Opferer fragt die Morgenröte …,” although Ge’s interpretation is
by no means excluded. The question is whether Varosuṣāman is the sacrificer
himself or his patron, and without a better knowledge of the distribution of roles in
RVic sacrifice, we cannot know for sure.
It is generally assumed (I think correctly) that the second hemistich is the
response of the addressee to the question in ab, and it is an extended pun. He calls the
subject, about whose whereabouts the question was just asked, “Vala,” that is, the
name of Indra’s opponent and the cave that contained the stolen cows. But Vala is
also a phonological variant of Vara, the first part of the name of the patron
Varosuṣāman. He is said to be “set apart” (ápaśritaḥ) along the Gomatī (River), but
gómant- literally means ‘possessing cattle’ and can also qualify the Vala cave itself
(see I.11.5 valásya gómataḥ). Thus this line appears to be a subtle reminder to
Varosuṣāman not to withhold his cattle within himself, like his phonological
multiform, but to be generous to his clients. The whole line reminds us of the
dānastuti in V.61.19: eṣá kṣeti ráthavītir maghávā gómatīr ánu, párveteṣv ápaśritaḥ
&ldquo;This Rathavīti dwells in peace, a bounteous patron throughout the cow-rich (clans)
[/along the Gomatī river], set back among the mountains,&rdquo; containing one of the only
two other occurrences of ápaśrita. I do not know the significance of this.
VIII.25 Mitra and Varuṇa</p>
<h3 id="viii251">VIII.25.1</h3>
<p>For the connection of the last pāda of this vs. with VIII.23.30, see comm.
there.</p>
<h3 id="viii252">VIII.25.2</h3>
<p>The du. mitrā́is used in two different senses: on the one hand, in its
appellative sense it refers to the two gods as allies; on the other mitrā́is a pregnant
dual PN, meaning “Mitra (and Varuṇa),” with the “and Varuṇa” then pleonastically
supplied in pāda b in an “X and which Y” construction (váruṇo yáś ca).
Most take tánā as another dual (to thematic tána-), but struggle to interpr. it. I
take it as the instr. sg. of the root noun tán- and in this context as indicating the
“(home) stretch” of a race course. The image is of two charioteers running neck and
neck and therefore evenly matched.
tánayā of course echoes tánā, though it belongs to a different stem (whichever
interpr. of tánā is followed). In this case I accept the general interpr. as du. to tánaya-.</p>
<h3 id="viii253">VIII.25.3</h3>
<p>Because the phrase asuryā̀ya prámahasā is found also in VII.66.2 (also of
Mitra and Varuṇa), the two words must be construed together &ndash; though in both
instances Ge construes them separately (as do Re and W. E. Hale). Moreover Ge’s
minimalist tr. of prámahas- (“Die … Erhabenen”) does not reflect its bahuvrīhi
status: it should mean something like ‘having their greatness forth/in front’. In
combination with the dat. asuryā̀ya, some forward motion seems indicated.</p>
<h3 id="viii254">VIII.25.4</h3>
<p>This is a particularly good passage to demonstrate that the unending
rivalry between the two opposed groups Devas and Asuras so characteristic of
middle Vedic literature cannot be backprojected into the core RV, since Mitra and
Varuṇa are called simultaneously devā́v ásurā.
The phrase ‘grandson of strength’ (śávaso nápāt-) is used a number of times
of the Ṛbhus (I.161.14, IV.34.6, 35.1, 8, 37.4) and only here of other divinities. It
seems based on the more common śávasas páti- (I.131.4, IV.47.3, V.6.9, etc.), with
(ná)pāt- echoing pát(i-). It also evokes semantically the phrase śávasaḥ sūnú-
(IV.21.1, 37.4) / putrá- (VIII.90.2, 92.14), ‘son/child of strength’.
VIII.25.5–6: The usual problem with (-)dānu-: ‘gift’ or ‘drop’ or both? In this case
the first cmpd member sṛpra- ‘fatty, luscious’, the dwelling “in the house of
refreshment” (in vs. 5), and the refreshments and rains (in vs. 6) favor ‘drop’, though
both Ge and Re opt for ‘gift’ (Ge with an outdated rendering of sṛprá- as
‘ausgedehnt’). On sṛprá- see comm. ad I.96.3.</p>
<h3 id="viii257">VIII.25.7</h3>
<p>“your herds” of the publ. tr. should rather be “their herds.”
VIII.25.8–9: Both these verses have a subject / VP construction that’s an
etymological figure: 8c … kṣatríyā kṣatrám āśatuḥ, 9c … nicirā́ní cikyatuḥ. The
latter is reinforced phonologically by the pāda-opening ní cin miṣántā. The unusual
tmesis of preverb and participle, interrupted by the particle cid, may be (partly)
accounted for by the desire to produce a ni ci- sequence matching the two that follow
in that pāda.
VIII.25.10–12: This tṛca takes a break from Mitra and Varuṇa, introducing a
somewhat random collection of other protective divinities. See also vs. 14.</p>
<h3 id="viii2511">VIII.25.11</h3>
<p>The lexeme ní √sac is found only here in the RV and indeed, judging
from MonWms, in all of Sanskrit. I consider the ní here intrusive, having crept in
from passsages like VII.38.3 víśvebhiḥ pātu pāyúbhir ní sūrī́n. The lexeme ní √pā is
fairly well attested, and so I think ní has, as it were, hitched a ride on pāyúbhiḥ,
which is ordinarily found with a form of the cognate verb as in the just cited passage.
The insistent ní’s of 11c may also have played a part.</p>
<h3 id="viii2512">VIII.25.12</h3>
<p>A verb needs to be supplied for ab to be a clause. On the basis of śrudhí
in c, I supply ‘sing’, but any verb of service to a divinity that takes a dative would
work. Ge “serve” (dienen), Re, somewhat more elaborately “apportons notre prière.”
Ideally we would supply sacemahi on the basis of áriṣyantaḥ … sacemahi in 11c, but
√sac doesn’t accommodate this case frame. (The few exx. with dat. given by Gr are
to be explained otherwise.)</p>
<h3 id="viii2513">VIII.25.13</h3>
<p>Alliteration in the etymological figure vā́ryaṃ vṛṇīmahe, váriṣṭham,
anticipating váruṇaḥ in c.</p>
<h3 id="viii2514">VIII.25.14</h3>
<p>In the publ. tr. I supply “let … grant,” flg. Ge, Re, Klein (DGRV I.403).
But I would now change that to “protect,” assuming that the tád + divinities in the
nom. simply continues the rel. cl. in 13c mitró yát pā́nti …</p>
<h3 id="viii2515">VIII.25.15</h3>
<p>The standard interpr. take bhū́rṇayaḥ with the frame (Ge “diese eifrigen
Herren”), but its position at the end of the verse, far from its supposed NP, leads me
to put it in the simile. (Sim. Re.) Passages like IX.17.1 … iva síndhavo, ghnánto
vṛtrā́ṇi bhū́rṇayaḥ “like turbulent rivers … smashing obstacles” give support to this
assignment. The simile then consists of a nom. + acc. matching those of the frame. It
might be objected that rivers don’t strike against their own surge, but the image may
be of fast water catching up with itself and overtopping a wave.</p>
<h3 id="viii2516">VIII.25.16</h3>
<p>itthā́is not sufficiently represented in the publ. tr. I would now insert
“just so” after “the many.”
ánu … carāmasi could also be subjunctive (so Ge), “we shall proceed,”
though the undoubted indicative ánu … saścima in the parallel phrase in 17ab
supports an indicative interpr. here.</p>
<h3 id="viii2517">VIII.25.17</h3>
<p>Flg. Kü I take the pf. of √sac as presential in value.
sāmrājyásya is in the same position as sā́mrājyāya ‘sovereign kingship’ in 8b
but differently accented. The form here must be an adj. ‘related to sovereign
kingship’. This makes sense: its referent, the Sun, is not a sovereign king himself, but
associated, as their eye and spy, with Mitra and Varuṇa, who are.
The form of dīrghaśrút is problematic. It appears to be a nom. sg., but the subj.
of this sentence is plural (“we”). Gr takes it as a neut. pl. modifying vratā́, as do Ge
(without comment) and Re; Scar identifies it as a neut. pl. but with a query. AiG
III.65–66 suggests that it follows the model of short neut. plural forms that are
identical to the neut. singular belonging to other stems (type nā́ma ‘name(s)’). I think
we can sympathize with the plight of a poet who’s trying to figure out how to make a
neut. pl. out of a root noun ending in -t: it’s simply impossible. In VII.16.8 we get
śárma dīrghaśrút#. Since śárma there could technically be plural (and there were
presumbly other such expressions with neut. n-stems, etc.), it’s not hard to see the
poet assuming, rightly or wrongly, that -śrút can be a neut. pl. Old also adduces</p>
<h3 id="viii612-1">VIII.61.2</h3>
<p>vípro mánmāni dīrghaśrút, where the adj. modifies nom. sg. vípraḥ but
could be interpr. as going with mánmāni.</p>

<p>I would now substitute ‘limits’ or ‘boundaries’ for ‘ends’ in tr. ántān.</p>

<p>On dīrgháprasadman-, see comm. ad VIII.10.1.
I don’t quite understand “non-poisonous food”: is this an understated way of
referring to good food, or is it a real fear? In VI.39.5 we call upon the king (Indra or
Soma) to give (√rā) non-poisonous plants. I also don’t understand the use of hí here,
since c does not seem to be the cause or grounds for ab, but rather a parallel clause.</p>
<h3 id="viii2521">VIII.25.21</h3>
<p>This is presumably the speech referred to in vs. 20 that controls good
things.</p>
<h3 id="viii2523">VIII.25.23</h3>
<p>This vs. is puzzling, in part because the identity of “these two” (tā́) is not
clear nor is the sense of nitóśana- + GEN. The lexeme ní √tuś means ‘overflow with,
spill down’ with an acc. of the largesse so spilled. See, e.g., IX.63.23 ní tośase rayím
&ldquo;You [=Soma] spill down wealth&rdquo; (cf. IV.38.1, VIII.54.8). I take the genitives here as
objective gens., corresponding to the acc. in the VP. Since both áśvyānām and
hárīṇāṃ refer to horses, we might want the two that are overflowing with them to be
the human (or possibly divine) givers. This is possible, if we take them as the two
patrons who give horses in 22ab (and not the one who gives a chariot in 22c). Or it
could be a reference to Mitra and Varuṇa (so Re). But du. nṛvā́hasā ‘carrying men’
in 23c and vājínāv árvantā “prize-winning chargers” in 24c must surely be horses
(probably the silvery and silver horses of 22ab), and this suggests that the duals
earlier in vs. 23 should have the same referent. This is Ge’s solution, and he
considers this expression shorthand for saying that the two horses given are worth as
much as a whole herd of horses. This may be correct, but it is a bit difficult to wring
it from the text.
kṛ́tvya- ‘effective, getting results’ is several times used of horses (VI.2.8,
IX.46.1, IX.101.2), and in this context that should be the default interpr. as well.</p>

<p>havāmahe havyébhiḥ “we call with oblations” is a word play between the
the roots √hu ‘pour, libate’ and √hū/hvā ‘call’ and economically refers to the two
complementary aspects of Vedic sacrifice, the verbal and the material. It is the mirror
image of the trope “pour prayers.”
iṣáyantau can belong either to trans. iṣáyati to √iṣ ‘send’ (so Gr, Lub) or
intrans. iṣáyati ‘prosper’. I tentatively opt for the latter, with a cognate acc. of respect,
iṣáḥ, hence “prosper, become refreshed with respect to refreshments.” It is not
entirely clear to me which root affiliation is represented by Ge’s “spenden” (probably
‘send’?) or Re’s “sécrétant à titre de jouissance” (probably ‘prosper’?).
I suggest that áti kṣapáḥ “beyond the nights” refers to the Atirātra soma
(“overnight soma”) offered to the Aśvins the morning after, as it were.</p>
<h3 id="viii268">VIII.26.8</h3>
<p>This vs. is somewhat curiously constructed. It contains, probably, a dual
dvandva whose 2nd member is itself dual: índra-nāsatyā ‘o Indra and the two
Nāsatyas’. Since the form is in the voc. it is actually impossible to determine if it is
in fact a dual dvandva or two separate vocc., índra nāsatyā, sg. and du. Although in
most dual dvandvas the first member also has dual inflection (type índrā-váruṇā), see
indra-vāyū́, with stem form in the first member and a single 2nd member accent; its
voc. is índra-vāyū, which would match the template found here. In any case, the verb
is dual (gatam), and the rest of the verse (pāda c) is couched in the dual. This either
means that Indra is being ignored (which is possible, since the hymn is dedicated to
the Aśvins) or that the dual dvandva índra-nāsatyā is being treated as if it contained
two entities, rather than one+two (which is also possible). For another number
mismatch, see vs. 11.</p>
<h3 id="viii269">VIII.26.9</h3>
<p>vayám … ukṣaṇyánto vyaśvavát is a play on words. ukṣanyántaḥ is read
doubly, in one sense in the frame (‘seeking bulls’) and another in the simile (‘seeking
Ukṣan’). Unusually the simile is conveyed by -vát. On the poet Vyaśva seeking his
patron Ukṣan, see VIII.23.16 vyàśvaḥ … ukṣaṇyúḥ, where ukṣanyúḥ can also be read
as a pun.</p>
<h3 id="viii2611">VIII.26.11</h3>
<p>Pāda c sajóṣasā váruṇo mitró aryamā́“the two of one accord (and) V, M,
A” is reminiscent of the number disharmony in vs. 8. It can be seen as a syntactic
blend of 8c devā́devébhiḥ … sacánastamā “the two gods joined with the gods” and a
putative plural sajóṣasaḥ that includes the Aśvins with the other gods mentioned.</p>
<h3 id="viii2612">VIII.26.12</h3>
<p>I take sūríbhiḥ as an instr. of accompaniment “for me along with my

possible: “do your best for me by means of / through my patrons.”</p>
<h3 id="viii2613">VIII.26.13</h3>
<p>I take the referent of ab to be Agni. Cf. III.3.5 táviṣībhir ā́vr̥tam ‘swathed
with [=in] his powers”; given Agni’s ritual role it makes sense for him to be swathed
in sacrifices. Making a god the referent avoids the role reversal Re notes in
saparyántā, with (in his view) the gods serving humans rather than the usual
situation &ndash; though he then tr. śubhé cakrāte as reflexive or self-involved: “ils se sont
fait (pour eux-mêmes une parure &ndash; contrapartie de b),” rather than supplying a
human object. But surely it is better (with Ge) to supply as obj. of śubhé cakrāte the
being referred to in the relative clause of ab.</p>
<h3 id="viii2614">VIII.26.14</h3>
<p>With Ge I take ab as a continuation of vs. 13, still with Agni as referent.
Agni is regularly called cikitvā́n, to the same stem as cíketati here. Clearly vartíḥ
‘circuit’ is to be supplied as object; it not only appears in pāda c but also in 15b,
where it is modified by nṛpā́yyam as here.</p>
<h3 id="viii2615">VIII.26.15</h3>
<p>viṣudrúheva (that is, -ā+iva) is quite problematic. Ge refuses to tr., as
does Scar (245–46), though by classing it with -druh-compounds, he indicates a root
affiliation. Acdg. to Re, it’s the equivalent of *druhó viśuvṛ́t “opposé au Mal” or “qui
met le Mal en déroute”; somewhat sim. Kü 484 “Wie die nach verschiedenen Seiten
Trügenden (?).” What all these suggestions have in common is the assumption that
the 2nd member belong to √druh ‘deceive’. I suggest a different analysis, viṣud-rúh-,
where the 2nd member is the root noun to √ruh ‘mount’, and the first (viṣud-) is a
deformed version of the already deformed adverb viṣvadryàk ‘facing in different
directions’, with the complex adverbial suffix found also in asmadryàk ‘facing
towards us’. The empty -d- (/-t-) has been suffixed to the combining form viṣu-
(/viṣū) underlying the adjective víṣvañc- ‘facing in different directions’. For the
suggested phrase, cf. IX.75.1 ráthaṃ víṣvañcam aruhat “he mounted the chariot that
faces in different directons” (with √ruh) and, with semantically related √yuj and
horses not chariot, VI.59.5 víṣūco áśvān yuyujāná īyate; X.79.7 víṣūco áśvān yuyuje
vanejā́ḥ.</p>

latter, but the former makes more sense to me.</p>

<p>The voc. ṛtaspate, belonging to a hapax cmpd., has an unusual 1st
member for a thematic stem. We should expect *ṛtapate. But to construct that form is
to confront its problem, a sequence of light syllables (4 in stem form). Rather than
seeing anything archaic in the form we have, I think it likely that the cmpd was
shaped in analogy to the numerous gen. -as-páti- with athem. gen., esp. bṛ́has-pátiwith similar phonological shape. See also ráthas-páti-, which shows the same
anomaly as ṛtaspate: comm. ad V.50.5. Unlike ráthas-páti-, the form here makes no

<p>I do not think that Vāyu is being compared directly to the pressing stone,
but rather than we call on Vāyu as we call on the pressing stone. Unfortunately this
attenuates the force of the simile, but the various suggestions (Old, Ge, Re) as to why
Vāyu is like a horse-backed stone are so convoluted that I find them difficult to
accept. The stone may be called horse-backed for two reasons: first, since the stones
are also called sóma-pṛṣtha- (VIII.63.2) and soma is commonly identified as a horse,
the identification has been transferred. It may also be that it also means ‘having the
back of a horse’, that is, bowed or made for carrying.</p>

<h3 id="viii272">VIII.27.2</h3>
<p>uṣā́sā náktam is a curious variant of the dual dvandva uṣā́sā-náktā,
occurring only here. Old suggests that it is an ex. of a singular 2nd member following
a dual in the 1st (cf. AiG II.1.154), which seems a description not an explanation. I
think two factors entered into its creation: on the one hand, all forms of uṣā́sā-náktā
precede a consonant; here that form would be in hiatus with vowel-initial óṣadhīḥ.
(Acdg. to Old, BR think that the original form was in fact náktā, but it was altered to
avoid hiatus.) But all forms of uṣā́sā-náktā are also initial in trimeter verse, where a
heavy fifth syllable is fine. This is dimeter verse, and a heavy fifth syllable would
produce a bad cadence; light -am V̄allows an iambic cadence.
Here and elsewhere through the hymn I render viśvávedas- as ‘affording all
possessions’, not ‘possessing all knowledge’, because it is usually found in the
context of the gods’ generosity.</p>
<h3 id="viii276">VIII.27.6</h3>
<p>The syntax of ab is oddly muddled for what seems on the surface a banal
sentiment. The problem is the position of the relative and its relationship both to the
priyā́earlier in the verse and accented verb prayāthána later. The key, I think, is neut.
pl. áśvyā ‘equine’. Contra Ge I don’t think that it should be construed with havyā́,
with “equine oblations” as a reference to the Aśvamedha &ndash; an interpr. that Re
rightly calls “adventurous.” The stem áśvya-, esp. in the neut. pl., is generally used of
gifts (rā́dhas-, maghá-) consisting of horses that gods (or patrons) give to mortals
(e.g., VII.16.10 yé rā́dhāṃsi dádaty áśvyā maghā́), whereas havyā́are of course
oblations given by mortals to gods. I think we therefore must reckon with two
different constructions in this hemistich, which accounts for the fractured word order.
On the one hand I see a nominal clause (or rather a nominal clause whose subject is
itself a relative clause): “which equine gifts are yours (i.e., come from you), (they)
are dear (to us).” On the other, the same predicate priyā́has as subject a full rel.
clause whose verb is prayāthána: “which oblations you drive to, (they) are dear to
you.” The vaḥ is used both as a genitive (in the first construction) and as a dative (in
the second). Unfortunately it is wrongly placed in the relative clause for this second
interpr., but I can only imagine that the poet allowed this small breach to avoid
doubling the vaḥ, or rather that the dative could be integrated into the rel. cl.: “which
oblations for you you drive to, they are dear.” Note that two different entities are
dear to two different groups of beings. I have not yet solved the problem of abhí,
however. Re’s interpr. requires prá √yā to be transitive and also intermingles the
main and relative clauses in an illegitimate way and should be rejected: “Di(riger)
vers (nos) oblations les chères troupes de chevaux que vous mettez en marche.”
Ge takes turā́náraḥ as a qualifier of the immediately following Ādityas.
Although both turá- and nṛ́- can sometimes apply to the Ādityas, they are more
frequently used of the Maruts, who are somewhat dominant in this part of the hymn
(1c, 3d, 5c, 6a, 8a).</p>

<h3 id="viii2718">VIII.27.18</h3>
<p>The 2nd hemistich presents some niggling syntactic and lexical problems.
To start with the latter, by most interpr. ásredhantī is transitive (Ge “ohne Schaden
anzurichten,” Re “sans causer de nuisance”). But the verb to which this negated
participle belongs is consistently intransitive, meaning ‘fail’, not ‘cause to fail’, and
though Gr glosses ásredhant- (and related stems) as transitive ‘nicht schädigend’,
hence ‘heilsam’, all passages are compatible with intransitive ‘unfailing, unfaltering’.
Although in this particular case ‘not harming’ might be tempting, the point here must
be that the missile should go to destruction without pause or deviation in its
trajectory.
I am disturbed by the pleonastic pāda-final sā́, doubling initial eṣā́, as well as
what looks like a self-contained clausette in which it is found: paró nú sā́. Neither Ge
nor Re takes any notice of the oddly constructed c pāda; Ge takes c and d as
independent clauses, while Re treats cd as a unified clause. My tr. tries to mirror the
construction by taking asmāt … paró nú sā́as a parenthetical. I remain concerned
about two things: 1) This is the only passage in which paráḥ seems to mean ‘far
from’; other passages containing paráḥ + ABL. mean ‘beyond, other than’ (see also
the 1st verse of the next hymn, VIII.28.1, with paráḥ ‘beyond’ without abl.). However,
‘far from X’ and ‘beyond X’ are close enough semantically to allay my concerns, and
in fact a tr. “it is now beyond him” would work fine. 2) I do not like the position of
asmāt, but I must assume that it was extracted from the paró nú sā́clausette in order
to conform to the pattern set in pāda a: x x cid asmai matched by c: x x cid asmāt.
I have reluctantly rendered cid in c as ‘also’ (so also Ge), though it does not
match the two cids in a and b (‘even’) because I cannot make ‘even’ work. (I suppose
“even this missile …” is possible, but it is not favored.)</p>
<h3 id="viii2720">VIII.27.20</h3>
<p>Most interpr. take mádhya ā́as indicating “in the midst (of the shelter)”
(chárdiḥ, of pāda b). This is certainly possible, though I weakly prefer my own
rendering.</p>
<h3 id="viii2721">VIII.27.21</h3>
<p>The hapax ātúc- is difficult. See EWA s.v. Mostly for contextual reasons
it is generally taken as referring to evening or night, and it has been connected to
tvác- ‘skin’, with the sense of ‘covering over’. I have followed this interpr., though
with full awareness of how fragile it is. For one thing ‘cover as if with skin’ (which
must be the presumed semantic channel, one way or another) is not an altogether
compelling way to get to ‘evening’. For another, tvác- ‘skin’ has no zero-grade forms.
Scar (182–83) discusses several possibilities. Besides the ‘covering’ hypothesis, he
suggests, citing Schindler and Kü, that tvác- may belong with a root √*tuek̯ ‘sichtbar
werden’ to which ātúc- could also belong, and that ātúc- might better be taken as an
adj. with madhyáṃdine “when midday is clearly visible.” He is less disturbed than I
am that this would leave the verse without a third temporal period; furthermore,
given that midday is the most “clearly visible” of the three standard time periods, it
seems unnecessary to mark it as such. Another problem with ātúc- is that one is
reluctant to separate it from the dat. tucé ‘for progeny’ in 14c. However, it is difficult
to connect them and still maintain sensible semantics in our verse. Scar makes a
creative attempt: evening is the time when one goes back to one’s children, so ‘zu
den Kindern hin’ becomes ‘Rückkehr nach Hause’. I admire the ingenuity but I think
the unlikeliness speaks for itself.
VIII.28 All Gods</p>
<h3 id="viii281">VIII.28.1</h3>
<p>Ge unaccountably takes injunctive vidán as modal: “Die sollen wirklich
(etwas) vorfinden,” but asanan (flg. Pp.) as preterital. As Old points out, however,
the latter need not be augmented (with Pp.) but represent dvitā́sanan with an
injunctive, a reading favored by the apparent parallelism with vidán. I follow the
injunctive reading, but take both vidán and sanan as preterital in function. I also
don’t think that an object should be supplied with either of these verbs, contra Ge
(“etwas,” which he further specifies in n. 1 as “die Opferspenden”) and Re (“un
trésor pour l’Homme”). The absence of objects with two verbs that are standardly
transitive must be deliberate. Note the absolute use of vindate in VIII.27.17.</p>
<h3 id="viii282">VIII.28.2</h3>
<p>The Gift Escorts (rāti-ṣā́c-) are rather shadowy divine figures. In II.1.13
they escort (saścire) Agni at the ceremonies, a situation that may be reflected here.
Otherwise they mostly show up in All God hymns (esp. a run of them in VII) as
fairly uncharacterized minor divinities. For further disc. cf. comm. ad VII.38.5. See
Scar 593.
In III.6.9 Agni is urged to bring the 33 gods (see our 1a) to the sacrifice along
with their wives (pátnīvant- as here), a ritual situation that can link our vss. 1–2.</p>
<h3 id="viii283">VIII.28.3</h3>
<p>Ge hesitates between cardinal points and relative directions (“behind,

<p>The phrase saptá ṛṣṭáyaḥ “seven spears” may be a sly pun on saptá ṛ́ṣayaḥ
“seven seers” (IV.42.8, X.130.7; also saptaṛṣáyaḥ X.82.2, 109.4). Although this
group is better known later and only occasionally referred to in the RV, it does have
a foothold there.
VIII.29 All Gods
On the intricate structure of this hymn see publ. intro. and my Rigveda
between Two Worlds (75–77).</p>
<h3 id="viii291">VIII.29.1</h3>
<p>The description given is apt for Soma. The soma twigs start out brown, but
when they are pressed, the golden juice comes out and, as it were, anoints them.</p>
<h3 id="viii292">VIII.29.2</h3>
<p>This vs. depicts in fairly straightforward terms the installation of Agni on
the ritual hearth.</p>
<h3 id="viii293">VIII.29.3</h3>
<p>Tvaṣṭar as referent of this verse is not so clear as some of the others, but in
his capacity as “shaper” and with his secondary association with the root √takṣ ‘hew,
carve, build’, it makes sense for him to have the axe as his emblem. The pairing with
the next verse, clearly of Indra, may also make sense, since by many accounts
Tvaṣṭar is Indra’s father. Oberlies (Relig. I.336) claims that this vs. has to do with
battles over settling places, which must first be made habitable by felling and
burning trees, but I think this reads too much into the passage.</p>
<h3 id="viii295">VIII.29.5</h3>
<p>On jálāṣa- see comm. ad I.43.4.
The 2nd pāda has 10 syllables rather than the expected 8. Unfortunately
deleting the somewhat pleonastic jálāṣa will not work because of its syllable count. It
would be possible to delete either of the first two adjectives &ndash; śúcir ugráḥ &ndash; but I see
no justification for that. It could be noted, however, that the other occurrence of
jálāṣabheṣaja- is found at the end of an 8-syllable pāda, preceded only by rudrám
(I.43.4).</p>
<h3 id="viii296">VIII.29.6</h3>
<p>Ge tr. pīpāya as ‘bewacht’ and assigns it to √pā ‘protect’ (via a byform
√pi), because he finds “swell the paths” semantically difficult. But ‘swell’ in the RV
universe of discourse is associated with prosperity and abundance, and swelling the
paths can simply refer to making them productive and full of the treasure mentioned
in the 2nd pāda. Since Pūṣan, the referent of this verse, ensures that livestock find
their way home, is associated with paths, and is called “lord of the path” (VI.53.1
pathas pate), the metaphorical expression “swell the paths” makes sense as a
description of his activities.
What may have tipped the balance for Ge is the simile in this pāda, “like a
thief,” for it hard to explain how a thief would “swell the paths” &ndash; whereas keeping a
close watch on the path (as a semantic extension of ‘protect, guard’) is something a
thief, or highwayman, would naturally do. Old is forced to suggest that the thief
makes the paths prosperous for himself in his own way, presumably by robbing
people who are traveling on them (sim. Re). But there is a simple solution to the
simile problem: take it with the 2nd pāda as I have done (sim. Macd., Maurer).
Although up to this point in the hymn, pāda boundaries coincide with syntactic
boundaries, the poet is starting to shake up the structure, which has been quite static
so far, and breaching the pāda break is his first step. Bolder moves follow in the next
vss.</p>
<h3 id="viii298">VIII.29.8</h3>
<p>I do not understand the apparently tautological 2nd pāda, prá pravāséva
vasataḥ, with the same type of double etymological figure as in VIII.27.16.
Renderings like Old’s “wie Reisende reisen sie” (sim. Ge, Re) are literally correct
but give no hint as to what the simile is conveying. There must be some wordplay
here, perhaps an astronomical reference? In later Skt. prá √vas can refer to exile or
banishment, and already in RV III.7.3 the causative means ‘cause to live apart,
banish’; in II.28.6 the poet expresses the hope that we won’t have to go to
pravasathā́ni ‘foreign dwellings’ and in VIII.60.19 Agni is a house-lord áproṣivān
‘who doesn’t go abroad’ (or, I suppose, just out of the house). Assuming that this
meaning is also operative in pravāsá- accounts for my “like exiles.”</p>
<h3 id="viii2910">VIII.29.10</h3>
<p>On my solution to the identity of the éke ‘some’, that is, the human
ritualists, see the publ. intro.
The pattern set in the rest of the hymn is also broken by placing a trisyllabic
word initially before the numeral; vss. 1–9 all begin with a disyllable.
Note the phonological play between the opening verb árcanti and the final
verb arocayan.
VIII.30 All Gods
For the rhetorical distance between vss. 1 and 2 see publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="viii301">VIII.30.1</h3>
<p>The -ka- suffix on arbhaká- and kumāraká- mark these words as
belonging to a lower register than normal Rigvedic discourse. See my 2009
“Sociolinguistic Remarks on the Indo-Iranian *-ka-Suffix.”</p>
<h3 id="viii302">VIII.30.2</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro. I take the introductory íti here as a mark
that the preceding vs. is the quoted praise referred to by iti stutā́so asathā “thus shall
you be praised.” Re comments that this is a relatively rare passage with íti not close
to direct speech. But my interpr. avoids that.
The 33, the (or a) canonical number of gods, were mentioned in a nearby
hymn by the same poet, VIII.28.1.</p>
<h3 id="viii304">VIII.30.4</h3>
<p>Ge takes víśve vaiśvānarā́utá as “and all the Vaiśvānaras” (so also Klein,
DGRV), but it is the gods who are vaiśvānará-, as Ge clearly states in his n. 4b.
(Interestingly, this is the only pl. form of this stem, which otherwise, save for one
passage [IX.61.16, referring to light], is used only of Agni.) The terms that are being
conjoined are ihá ‘here’ and ‘belonging to all men’, not gods and Vaiśvānaras; the
point is that they are here and available to us because they belong to all of us. There
is also complementary contrast between “all gods” and “(belonging) to all men,” and
the víśve of the former phrase has been postponed so that it can adjoin the latter:
devāsaḥ …, víśve vaiśvānarā́ḥ.
VIII.31 Yajamāna and patnī, etc.</p>
<h3 id="viii312-1">VIII.31.2</h3>
<p>The word order of c is slightly skewed. All things being equal, forms of
the sá/tám pronoun, esp. in correlative usage, tend to take 1st position in the
pāda/clause. This expectation is reinforced here by 2nd position íd ‘just, only’, which
really should limit tám (as my tr. reflects), but the verb pā́t seems to have displaced
the pronoun to the right of íd.</p>
<h3 id="viii315">VIII.31.5</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., vss. 1–4 and 5–9 present loosely parallel
treatments of the rewards of sacrifice, with 1–4 applying to the sacrificer alone and
5–9 to the sacrificer and his wife. In this vs. sunutáḥ (5b) reprises sunávat of 1b, and
the structure of those two b pādas is roughly the same: sunávac ca pácāti ca and
sunutá ā́ca dhā́vataḥ, with two ritual verbs conjoined by ca(s). The nítyāśirā ‘with
its own proper milk-mixture’ referring to soma echoes sómam … āśíram in 2b.</p>
<h3 id="viii316">VIII.31.6</h3>
<p>prāśavyā̀n has been subject to various analyses. Sāy suggests
‘nourishment’, which is tentatively accepted by Re. Ge tr. “die für die Pünktlichen
bestimmten (Belohnungen)” without comment, leaving it unclear (at least to me)
even what root he assigns it to. With Old (also EWA s.v. ŚĀVI
, Hoffmann apud Gotō
304 n. 723, Scar 539–40), I take it to the root √śū ‘swell’ and connect it to the root
noun cmpd prāśū́- in the following hymn (though attributed to a different poet),
VIII.32.16. (Contra Re explicitly.) In both passages the lexeme seems to have a
negative connotation, ‘swollen (with pride), puffed up’. Here the sacrificing married
couple successfully ‘go up against’ (práti √i), that is, compete with, these puffed-up
rivals. The passage reminds us of the Agastya and Lopāmudrā hymn, I.179.3 …
víśvā spṛ́dho abhy àśnavāva / … yát samyáñcā mithunā́v abhyájāva “Let us two take
on all contenders … when as a united couple we will drive on,” depicting another
sacrificing pair competing with rivals. Our vs. and I.179.3 contain the only two masc.
du. samyáñcā in the RV. The triumph over hostile rivals is also expressed in the
parallel section of this hymn (vss. 1–4) in 3c víśvā vanvánn amitríyā “winning all
(the things) of the enemy.”</p>
<h3 id="viii317-1">VIII.31.7</h3>
<p>vivāsataḥ ‘the two seek to win’ is matched in the parallel by 3c vanván
‘winning’.</p>
<h3 id="viii318-1">VIII.31.8</h3>
<p>putríṇā … kumāríṇā “possessing sons, possessing children” expands on
prajā́vatī ‘possessing offspring’ in the parallel, 4a.</p>
<h3 id="viii319">VIII.31.9</h3>
<p>With Ge and Re, I take pāda c as referring to sex, though in a devotional
context (Ge: “Kinderzeugung als verdienstliches Werk”). The point of the Agastya
and Lopāmudrā hymn I.179, already cited ad vs. 6, is of course that ascetic practice
must yield to sex as a duty even for the very devout.</p>
<h3 id="viii3110">VIII.31.10</h3>
<p>Flg. Ge, I take svastí sarvadhā́tamaḥ as if containing a dvandva svastisarva-. Ge convincingly cites other svastí √dhā passages. It might be possible to take
it instead as a (short) instr.: “best establishing wholeness along with well-being,”
though the status of svastí as an instr. seems shaky to me. Scar (264) takes it as an
acc., with sarva- in the cmpd functioning as a predicative acc. to it: “der am besten
das Glück vollständig macht.”</p>
<h3 id="viii3112">VIII.31.12</h3>
<p>This vs. consisting entirely of nominals is surprisingly hard to interpret,
primarily because of the unclear grammatical identity of anarváṇaḥ and the lack of
parallelism between the animates of ab and the neut. aneháḥ of c.
To deal with the first problem first, beside the -n-stem anarván- we must
reckon with a thematized form anarváṇa- (so Gr, Lub), the latter of which is attested
twice as apparent nom. sg. masculine anarváṇaḥ (V.51.11 [or pl?] and this passage)
and once as apparent acc. sg. masculine anarváṇam (X.92.14). Unfortunately all
three forms immediately follow feminine singulars (áditiḥ, arámatiḥ, áditim
respectively). Despite this clear pattern, I was reluctant to interpr. the apparent masc.
forms as fem., esp. in the case of the nominative forms, and therefore contrived ad
hoc fixes for those passages. Here the fix is not too difficult: the immediately
following word (beginning the next pāda) is masc. víśvaḥ. I take this as referring to
another entity who should come here, with anarváṇaḥ modifying it, rather than
arámatiḥ. The referent is in fact open-ended: “every” or “any” one with the mind of a
god. Note the evocation of the All Gods through the phrase víśvo devásya, though the
words are in different cases.
Although this will (barely) work, on reexamining the evidence I am not at all
sure that it is worth denying the apparent pattern of feminine reference with this stem,
and I might substitute (with Ge) “Aramati, the unassailing one,” though in this
passage that leaves masc. víśvaḥ orphaned. Both Old (ad V.51.11; see his careful disc.
there) and Re in their different ways take anarváṇaḥ here as a nom. pl., but the nom.
pl. to the athem. stem is anarvā́ṇaḥ, and in this passage the immediately following sg.
víśvaḥ makes further trouble. It is worth noting that the bahuvrīhi anarván- and its
derivatives have a troubled relationship with gender in general; see comm. ad I.37.2,
185.3, VI.48.15, II.40.6. In several instances, masc. forms are used to qualify neuters
(I.37.2 and VI.48.15), and the supposed masc. nom. sg. of the -n-stem seems to have
fem. reference in II.40.6 and VII.40.4. This may have led to a certain cavalier
tendency to use masc. forms to cover all genders, even when not morphologically
necessary.
As for aneháḥ, Ge and Re supply ‘protection’ (Ge “der unfelhbare (Schirm)
der Ādityas”) on the basis of VIII.18.21, while Old (ad V.51.11) takes it as an adv.
(construing ādityā́nām with víśvaḥ), though in his comm. on this passage he rescinds
this in favor of its depending on aneháḥ (without tr.). On the basis of I.185.3 anehó
dātrám áditer anarvám “the faultless gift of Aditi, which is unassailable” I tentatively
supply ‘gift’ (note the presence also of another apparently variant stem, anarvá-; see
comm. there). However, the Ge/Re solution is quite possible.</p>

<p>The 1st sg. īḷe in b does not match the nom. pl. part. saparyántaḥ in c. I

<h2 id="viii32-indra">VIII.32 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii322">VIII.32.2</h3>
<p>Ge takes ánarśanim and ahīśúvam as PNs, in addition to sṛ́bindum and the
familiar píprum. Mayrhofer (2003, Personennamen) is uncertain about ánarśani-.
Scar (538–39) tr. all as PNs as well, but discusses the possible interpretations of
ahīśū́-. On the basis of the parallel he cites in IV.16.13 píprum mṛ́gayaṃ śūśuvā́ṃsam
“Pipru Mrgaya, ̥ swollen with power,” with the pf. part. to √śū, I prefer to take ahīśū́-
as a meaningful epithet. The question is then what the first member ahī- represents.
Although it would be easier to identify it with ahī́- ‘fertile cow’, which matches it
exactly, I prefer to take it as a metrically lengthened version of áhi- ‘snake’, which
makes more sense in the designation of a demon. See Scar (loc. cit.), also EWA s.v.
ahī́-. All four occurrences of this stem would have four short syllables if the second
weren’t long ī, but I do not otherwise have an explanation of the lengthening. But
note prāśū́- below (16b) with the same lengthening before śū́-.
As for ánarśani- I would again prefer to give it full lexical value, relating it
(as Gr does) to ánarśa-rāti- (VIII.99.4) ‘possessing non-harmful gifts’(?), arśasānádesignation of another demon. See EWA s.v. arśasāná-. However, the root
etymology (supposed √arś/ṛś ‘harm’) is not strong, and the analysis remains
uncertain. If it does mean ‘harmless’, the adjective is used proleptically, as is not
uncommon.
The name of the first demon, Sṛbindu, displays non-Indo-Aryan phonology.
See Kuiper (Aryans 40–41).</p>

<p>I have nothing useful to say about the morphology of kṛṣé.</p>
<h3 id="viii324">VIII.32.4</h3>
<p>With Ge I supply both “bring” and “soma,” though I would prefer to have
more formulaic or textual support for providing this extraneous material – however,
cf. II.14.8 gábhistipūtam bharata śrutā́ya “Bring what is purified by your hand
[=soma] to the one who is famed,” adduced by Ge. The preverb práti occurs with
√bhṛ (see, e.g., VIII.20.9 práti … śárdhāya mā́rutāya bharadhvam / havyā́…), but is
not common.
tū́rṇāśa- is a hapax without etymology (though Old’s literal gloss, “was dem
Ueberschreitenden Verschwinden, Untergang bringt,” implies √tṝ and √naś, without
attempting to explain the morphology). I follow the consensus, that the word refers to
a watercourse of some sort, since that makes sense in context. As often, verbal play
may have had a role in its appearance here: 4b #tū́rṇāśaṃ ná &hellip; is partly echoed by
5c púraṃ ná śūra … (ūr/ur na am ś, though not in the same order in both).</p>
<h3 id="viii326">VIII.32.6</h3>
<p>An alternative syntactic analysis of ab would take everything through vā in
b as part of the yádi clause with rāráṇaḥ as verb, and start the main clause with
dádhase, accented because it’s clause-initial: “If you will take pleasure in my pressed
(soma) or in my solemn speech, you will find delight.” There are no strong
arguments either way.</p>
<h3 id="viii328">VIII.32.8</h3>
<p>I do not understand Ge’s tr. of saṃrarāṇáḥ as ‘mitteilsam’
(communicative, talkative) and as if it were an adjective modifying food (“bring us
mitteilsam Speise…”). (I assume that the specialization of this German cmpd for
[verbal] communication postdates Ge’s language acquisition stage and his usage
reflects some sense of teilen ‘divide, share’.) Kü (421) suggests that this participle
means “bereitwillig, spendefreudig,” implying that it is used absolutely and doesn’t
take an object. This certainly is possible here, but doesn’t bring us to Ge’s rendering.
In any case, the form here (-rarāṇáḥ to √rā) echoes rāráṇaḥ (to √ran) in 6a.</p>
<h3 id="viii3210">VIII.32.10</h3>
<p>bṛbáduktha- is a hapax and has aggressively non-Indo-Aryan phonology
(not one, but two b’s). My rendering is adopted from Weber (1891, cited by EWA s.v.
bṛbú-; see also s.v. bṛbáduktha-). The word must deliberately evoke the name and
epithet bṛhád-uktha- but should not be emended thereto; see Old and Ge. If Weber’s
suggestion is correct, this may be a little joke, implying that Indra is powerful but not
very good with words.</p>
<h3 id="viii3211">VIII.32.11</h3>
<p>A novel construction, at least as interpreted by Ge (fld. by Klein and
accepted also by me). The word -kratu- ‘intention, resolve’ is extracted from Indra’s
epithet śatá-kratu- and implicitly made object of kṛnóti, represented by the enclitic
pronoun īm. See Ge’s “der … hundertfach Rat weiss und ihn ausführt.”</p>
<h3 id="viii3212">VIII.32.12</h3>
<p>A similar type of construction as the immediately preceding verse,
though the connection between epithet and its dynamic manifestation is clearer: the
epithet śakráḥ ‘able’ is transformed into the verb śakat ‘he will be able’. For an
almost identical construction see I.10.6 and discussion there.
In both 11 and 12 I take cid as marking the epithet to be transformed, though
in 11a it is displaced to the left.
Ge interprets the hapax antarābhará- as “der zwischen den Kämpfen steht,”
presuming an analysis antarā-bhará-, rejected by Old, who favors the Pp antaraābhará-. This fits the context better.</p>
<h3 id="viii3214">VIII.32.14</h3>
<p>Ge takes máhi sthirám as the neut. obj. of āyantā́ram, supplying ‘bow’:
“Der den grossen starken (Bogen) spannt.” There are several objections to this. First,
it’s ā́√tan, not ā́√yam, that is the standard idiom for stretching or spanning the bow,
including in the passages he cites as parallels. Moreover, suffix-accented -tár- stems
(like ā́yantár- here) ordinarily govern the genitive not the accusative, and although
this rule is often violated, the fact that niyantár- in the following verse (15), an agent
noun to the same root, does take the genitive makes it less likely that this one would
take an accusative. I therefore take sthirám as a modifier of Indra (as in the next
hymn, VIII.33.9, and elsewhere) and máhi as adverbial. āyantár- here is best
interpreted in the context of ā́yachantu in 23b below.</p>
<h3 id="viii3216">VIII.32.16</h3>
<p>On prāśū́- see Scar (539–40) and vs. 2 above, as well as comm. ad
VIII.31.6.
This verse is oddly couched as an impersonal. Ge’s interpretation of it is
conventional: the humans have fulfilled their obligation (ṛṇám) to the god and he
correspondingly fulfills his to them. But the curiously detached affect of the
expression gives me pause, and the temporal relations between ab and c are
backwards for this interpretation: nūnám ‘now’ situates the first two pādas
temporally after the action of the third, whose verb is the perfect pape, and the
perfect of √pā is generally preterital. I therefore interpret the verse quite differently
from Ge. I take the debt to be Indra’s, what he owes to the human worshippers who
praise and press soma for him. But he has preemptatively fulfilled it: his somadrinking is always accompanied by his gift. The reason for the indirect and
impersonal expression is to avoid saying directly that Indra could owe a debt to
humans. This interpretation requires taking the genitives in ab as quasi-datives, but
this is quite common.
On apratā́see Old.</p>
<h3 id="viii3217">VIII.32.17</h3>
<p>The loc. pánye as beneficiary/target of the verbs √gā ‘sing’ and √śaṃs
‘recite’ is peculiar: these verbs generally take the dative or, esp. with certain
preverbs, the accusative. But loc. pánya in sandhi matches the nominative pánya in
sandhi (that is, underlying pányaḥ) that begins the next verse (18a), and this match
accounts for the unusual case usage. A small, but telling, example of how rhetorical
motivations can override strictly grammatical issues.</p>
<h3 id="viii3218">VIII.32.18</h3>
<p>The intensive (that is, iterative-frequentative) dardirat is appropriate to

<h3 id="viii3220">VIII.32.20</h3>
<p>The curious term svádhainava- appears to mean ‘having its own
milk/milk-cows’, with vṛddhi of dhenú- (see AiG II.2.114). It echoes svadhā́ánu in
19a, and, as often, this echo may help account for its deployment here. Its referent is
presumably soma-pressings or soma-drinks.
The relation between pāda a and the relative clauses of bc is, at best,
“improper.” That is, the two singular forms yáḥ in b and c must have as their (rough)
antecedent the gen. plural of pāda a referring to the pressings/drinks.</p>
<h3 id="viii3222">VIII.32.22</h3>
<p>I take áti only with b: Indra is not supposed to pass over the three realms,
but through them on his way to us. It is only the (other) peoples he is to pass over.</p>
<h3 id="viii3223">VIII.32.23</h3>
<p>Pāda a plays on the ambiguity of raśmí-, both ‘ray’ and ‘rein’.
Although the simile in c seems to match the frame in b in case (nom. gíraḥ /
ā́paḥ, acc. tvā / nimnám), there is a functional mismatch: the waters are not guiding
the deep as the songs are guiding Indra. It therefore seems best to take ā́paḥ as one of
the occasional examples of nom. for acc. in this stem, corresponding to tvā in the
frame, with nimnám a further specification of goal. Ge clearly recognizes the
problem and supplies a verb for the simile in c, “wie die Gewässer … (fliessen),” but
this violates the structure of the RVic simile, which always holds the verb in
common with the frame.</p>
<h3 id="viii3224">VIII.32.24</h3>
<p>The hí in the first imperative clause provides the logical basis for the
second one. See Brereton 2012.</p>
<h3 id="viii3226">VIII.32.26</h3>
<p>On ṛ́cīṣama- see I.61.1.
As in 2b ahīśúvam may be a PN, but I prefer to take it with lexical value. The
same problem is encountered with aurṇavābhá-. Arbuda, however, is a known
enemy of Indra, but this episode, with snow as the weapon, is otherwise unknown.
Note again the non-Indo-Āryan phonology.
The return of the theme of Indra’s smashing named enemies from vs. 2
suggests a ring, and the fact that the following verses (27–28) sketch a ring with vs. 1
strengthens this impression.</p>
<h3 id="viii3227">VIII.32.27</h3>
<p>The “who lays low” of the publ. tr. might be better “who lays (enemies
[vel sim.]) low,” to make clear that a transitive sense is required.
VIII.32.27–28: These two verses form a sort of ring with vs. 1. There gā́thayā / máde
sómasya vocata “with a song proclaim … in the exhilaration of soma”; here bráhma
gāyata // … sómasya máde “sing a formulation … in the exhilaration of soma.”</p>
<h2 id="viii33-indra">VIII.33 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii331">VIII.33.1</h3>
<p>This verse has at least one clear subject (vayám ‘we’ in a) and one clear
verb (3rd pl. pári … āsate ‘sit around’ in d), but they do not match grammatically.
There are (at least) two solutions: either to supply a 1st ps verb with ab (or abc) (so
Ge) or to assume a modulation from 1st ps to 3rd ps. because of the nom. pl. stotā́raḥ
‘praisers’ in d, which, by this interpretation, would be in apposition to vayám. (Ge
acknowledges this possibility in his n.) Despite the awkwardness I prefer the second
option, in part because there is no obvious verb to supply in the earlier part of the vs.
&ndash; though I admit that Ge’s “anbrausen” (√svar) is possible, given sváranti opening
vs. 2 and the parallels he cites in his n. for singers and waters as subjects of √svar.
The other problem is the application of the simile “like waters” in b. It is not
immediately clear why we are like waters. I would like to connect the simile to the
phrase pavítrasya prasrávaneṣu in c and suggest that the waters go in circles at this
outpouring just as we take our seats in a circle. It is also possible that the waters are
being compared to the pressings in the adjective sutā́vantaḥ “provided with pressings,
(which are) like waters.”
On both difficulties in this verse, see detailed discussion by Old.</p>
<h3 id="viii333">VIII.33.3</h3>
<p>Phonetic figure in ab dhrṣṇ̥ av &hellip; dhr̥ṣád &hellip; darṣi
Ge supplies “gepreisen” with the instr. káṇvebhiḥ. He is probably correct that
the Kaṇvas are not likely to be assisting Indra in his conquests, but I still resist
supplying material without a clear basis.</p>
<h3 id="viii334">VIII.33.4</h3>
<p>“Drink!” is an imperative that the poet Medhyātithi should not be
addressing to himself, as opposed to “sing!” I therefore take it as the content of his
song, addressed to Indra.
In d Ge takes the last two words rátho hiraṇyáyaḥ as a separate nominal
clause “golden is his chariot.” This is possible, but I think it is far more likely a
phrase qualifying Indra, despite its slight oddness. Indra can be called a chariot
because he comes with lots of goods, like a chariot (see, e.g., I.125.3 vásumatā
ráthena), and also because he’s “linked” (sáṃmiślaḥ) to the two horses, as if he were
the chariot they are yoked to and pull. Moreover, starting with 4c the rest of the tṛca
(4c–6c) consists only of descriptions of Indra in the nominative, arranged in relative
clauses. A nominal clause with a different subject would interrupt this structure.</p>
<h3 id="viii335">VIII.33.5</h3>
<p>I take the phrase suṣavyáḥ sudákṣiṇaḥ as referring to Indra’s two horses,
since it follows immediately on a hemistich (4cd) concerning those horses and his
chariot. But ‘sides’ or ‘hands’ are also possible. Ge simply fails to supply a referent
(“Der eine gute Linke, eine gute Rechte hat”). I.82.5 yuktás te astu dákṣiṇa utá
savyáḥ &hellip; supports my interpretation as horses.</p>
<h3 id="viii336">VIII.33.6</h3>
<p>The expression śmáśruṣu śritáḥ “embedded within his beard” is striking. It
seems to be a slightly jocular expression, meaning perhaps that Indra has such a big
bushy beard that it&rsquo;s as if he&rsquo;s been embedded into it &ndash; one sees it before one sees
him.</p>
<h3 id="viii337">VIII.33.7</h3>
<p>The presupposition behind the questions of ab seems to be that Indra
becomes so formidable when he drinks soma that he becomes unrecognizable.
Shape-shifting of heroes under such circumstances is widespread.</p>
<h3 id="viii338">VIII.33.8</h3>
<p>I think the idea behind the simile is that elephants establish a large
territory in which they wander, and that Indra has established a similarly large
territory by giving to sacrificers scattered all over the map. Ge’s “mit seinem
Bruntsaft” (‘rutting liquid’) stems from an idea of Pischel’s (see Old, Kl. Sch 306)
connecting this passage with the later (Epic+ dāna- meaning elephant’s rutting liquid
[see EWA s.v. dāná-]). This seems unlikely and it is hard to see how simile and
frame would work together.
I have toyed with another possibility that remains tantalizingly hard to realize:
dānā́may indeed be a pun, but a different one: an instrumental both to dānā́, as it’s
taken here, and also to dāmán- ‘rope’ (whose inst. is indeed regularly dānā́). In this
second reading ná would be ‘not’, not ‘like’, and vāraṇáḥ would be some derivative
of √vṛ ‘hold back, restrain’ in addition to ‘wild’. The meaning of the second reading
would be “a beast not (to be) restrained by a rope,” in addition to “Like a wild
elephant … by his giving.” The second reading would harmonize with 6a, 10b ávṛtaḥ
‘unobstructable’ and be paraphrased by the next pāda in its own verse, 8c nákiṣ ṭvā ní
yamat “No one will restrain you.” However, I have been unable to find a way to
make vāraṇá- a plausible form of √vṛ in the correct sense and so have not pursued
this possibility further.</p>
<h3 id="viii339">VIII.33.9</h3>
<p>At first glance it is hard to find a concessive sense for the pres. part. sán in
pāda a, despite its usual value. Indeed Ge takes ab as an independent nominal clause
and begins a new sentence in c. However, the idea may be that although Indra is very
tough and primed for battle, he’ll drop everything and come when we call him to the
sacrifice.
The sense ‘perfected’ for sáṃskṛta- may be anachronistic; if so, ‘entirely
readied’ or the like can substitute.</p>
<h3 id="viii3312">VIII.33.12</h3>
<p>On ṛjīpin see comm. ad IV.26.6.
“In the waters” in the publ. tr. should be corrected to “in the rivers.”
Ge and Kü (256) take dadhanve as transitive (Ge “… liess … laufen,” Kü “…
hat laufenlassen…”), but the other examples of this medial perfect are intransitive
(VIII.19.1, also taken by Kü as transitive, can be interpreted in the same way as this
one), and the accusative can easily be a goal.</p>
<h3 id="viii3313">VIII.33.13</h3>
<p>On nā́yám see VIII.2.28. After my reexamination of the evidence (Hock
Fs., 2013) I would now rephrase the translation of the first three pādas as “Drive here,
most powerful Indra, to the somian honey to drink it, as bounteous one, all on your
own,” eliminating “to the landing site” and construing áchā with mádhu … somyám
in the preceding pāda.
A new clause begins with śṛṇávat in the middle of c. Ge takes all of cd
together, but the accentuation of śṛṇávat is unexplained in this interpretation.
Moreover áchā is not otherwise found with √śru but is common with √yā.
VIII.33.16–19: As discussed in the publ. intro., in my view this strange pendant to
the hymn is an oblique attack on what I consider a late RVic ritual innovation, the
introduction of the Patnī, Sacrificer’s Wife, as a required role in standard ritual. For
both general discussion of this situation and some detailed consideration of passages
throughout the RV, including this one, that fight this doctrinal battle, see Jamison
2011 “The Secret Lives of Texts” (Presidential Address, American Oriental Society
2010; JAOS 131: 1–7) and “‘Sacrificer&rsquo;s Wife’ in the Rig Veda: Ritual Innovation?”
(Brereton and Proferes, eds., Creating the Veda, Living the Veda: Selected Papers
from the 13th World Sanskrit Conference, 19–30). The division of speakers, again in
my view, is that the poet, who opposes the new ritual model, speaks the first (16) and
last (19) verses, while 17–18 are put in the mouth of Indra, who is a proponent.
These verses are extensively discussed by Old and Ge, with Old somewhat more in
line with my own interpretation; I will not consistently signal my agreements and
disagreements with them in what follows.</p>
<h3 id="viii3316">VIII.33.16</h3>
<p>I take the disgruntled speaker to be the poet and the subject of ráṇyati to
be a rival ritualist, who has accepted the new doctrine. The “you or me” of pāda a is
rather like the English expression “the likes of you and me,” meaning “ordinary
people.” I take the nahí … nó (= ná u) as having domain only over táva and máma,
not the anyásya of pāda b. By my rules (Jamison 1997) anyá- in this position should
be definite (not Ge’s indefinite “oder eines anderen…”), and I take its referent to be
Indra. The referent of the yáḥ in the rel. clause in c I again take to be Indra (that is,
anyásya), rather than the subject of ráṇyati, as Ge does. The designation vīrá- is of
course regularly applied to Indra, and “led us here” can refer both to Indra’s
leadership in the acquisition of new territory and to his role in introducing the ritual
innovation. And Indra starts off the next verse.</p>
<h3 id="viii3317">VIII.33.17</h3>
<p>Indra begins, cleverly, with concession: he admits that women’s mental
powers are not as strong as they should be. I take this as Indra’s direct speech, even
though pāda c is in the accusative (and pāda b could be), since I think such mixed
constructions (X said “abc” / said that abc) are found elsewhere. However, little is
lost if it is taken as indirect discourse.</p>
<h3 id="viii3318">VIII.33.18</h3>
<p>In my interpretation Indra’s speech continues here, and having admitted
the drawbacks to employing women in the ritual, he introduces the model of the
yoked pair (that is, the married couple) drawing the chariot of sacrifice, a pair that
must be more or less equally matched, but with the pole of the male somewhat higher
than that of the female. (Some animals are more equal than others.) The image of the
sacrifice as a chariot is of course a common one, and the word mithunā́
‘complementary pair, sexual pair’ seems to me the tipoff that this is about the
married couple. (Old is in general agreement.)</p>
<h3 id="viii3319">VIII.33.19</h3>
<p>The poet returns in his own voice to mock the new model, by imitating in
the first three pādas the speech of a mother to her little daughter, inculcating proper
behavior. kaśaplakaú in c is a hapax, but its -ka- suffix suggests that it belongs to a
low register (note also pādakaú in b) and the fact that it is in the dual limits its
possible applications. Old suggests “weibl. Geschlechsteile” (though he moves on to
breasts), and the fact that keeping one’s feet together keeps them from being seen
makes the labia a good possibility.
The poet then unleashes a devastating insult on his addressee, a brahman –
that he has turned into a woman. I take this unfortunate figure to be the ritualist
favoring the new model, and our poet is suggesting that too much association with
and sympathy for women, too much emphasis on equality, will unman a man.</p>
<h2 id="viii34-indra">VIII.34 Indra</h2>
<p>On the formal structure that dominates this hymn see the intro. The hymn is
awkward to translate and, I have to say, sometimes seems awkwardly composed.</p>
<h3 id="viii341">VIII.34.1</h3>
<p>I do not understand the accent on yayá in the refrain, but it may be
implicitly contrastive with yāhi in a.</p>
<h3 id="viii343">VIII.34.3</h3>
<p>Note the syntactic disharmony between simile and frame, exploiting the
variant valencies of the verb, with dhūnute an intrans.-reflexive in the frame (“felly
shakes [itself]”) but transitive in the simile (“as a wolf shakes a lamb”). See Jamison
1982.</p>
<h3 id="viii345">VIII.34.5</h3>
<p>Since the referent of te is Indra, explicitly comparing him to a bull in the
simile vṛ́ṣṇe ná seems odd, since he is ordinarily simply identified as such. Ge seems
to think it’s a real bull, exhibiting thirst.</p>
<h3 id="viii3416">VIII.34.16</h3>
<p>See the publ. intro. for the relation between the PN Vasurocis and the
vocative addressed to Indra through the first fifteen verses, divāvaso.
An example of the rare 1st ps. dual construction “(I) and X” as subject of a 1st
dual verb, with the “I” unexpressed: índraś ca dádvahe “(I) and Indra took …” For
further discussion see VIII.62.11.</p>
<h3 id="viii3418">VIII.34.18</h3>
<p>The apparent PN Pārāvata (‘who comes from afar’) apparently naming
the patron makes sense as a speaking name in this hymn, which emphasizes the
coming here of Indra from distant places and allows the identification of patron and
Indra.
Note that the last word of the hymn is ā́, as it was the first (and it opens
twelve of the hymn’s verses).</p>
<h2 id="viii35-aśvins">VIII.35 Aśvins</h2>
<p>See the publ. intro. for the pattern of repetitions in this very repetitious hymn.
The c pāda of every vs. save for the last three (22–24), “in concert with Dawn and
the Sun” (sajóṣasā uṣásā sū́ryeṇa ca), of course refers to the Aśvins’ participation in
the dawn sacrifice.
VIII.35.10–12: The first hemistichs of the three verses in this tṛca are excessively
provided with ca’s, as well as 2nd du. act. impvs in -tam. Cf., e.g., 10ab píbataṃ ca
tṛpṇutáṃ cā́ca gachatam, prajā́ṃ ca dhattám dráviṇaṃ ca dhattam.</p>
<h3 id="viii3511">VIII.35.11</h3>
<p>The distribution of ca’s in pāda a is somewhat puzzling or, perhaps,
syncopated, with the 2nd ca following preverb+verb (prá stutaṃ ca), though the other
two preverb/verb combinations in this tṛca place the ca in the expected position after
the preverb (ā́ca gachatam 10a and immediately following prá cāvatam 11a). This
does not seem to be metri causa, or at least not in some obvious way.</p>
<h3 id="viii3513">VIII.35.13</h3>
<p>Exactly what dhármavant- is conveying here is unclear, but it is highly
unlikely to be, with Ge, “von Dharma [den Gesetz] … begleitet,” since ‘law’ is quite
anachronistic for dhárma(n)-. I also do not think Re is correct in seeing it as a proper
noun, despite its appearance in a -vant-stem parallel to those containing gods’ names.
Rather, the repetitive template of the tṛca imposes the -vant-stem here, on the abstract
principle dhárman- generally associated with Mitra and Varuṇa &ndash; here perhaps
referring to their authority and its manifestation (their statute) by which they impose
order on the world.</p>
<h3 id="viii3515">VIII.35.15</h3>
<p>vā́javant- may mean &ndash; instead of, or in addition to, ‘accompanied by
prizes’ &ndash; ‘accompanied by Vāja’ (name of one of the Ṛbhus) or ‘… the Vājas’ (as a
designation of all the Ṛbhus). Certainly the juxtaposition with ṛbhumánt- is meant.
VIII.35.16–18: A verb needs to be supplied with the d pādas of this tṛca (sómaṃ
sunvató aśvinā). On both general grounds and the d pādas of vss. 1–3 (sómam
pibatam aśvinā)(see also 22b píbatam somyám mádhu), ‘drink’ makes the most sense,
though ‘drive to’, which dominates the middle part of the hymn, is certainly possible.</p>
<h3 id="viii3523">VIII.35.23</h3>
<p>On vivákṣaṇa- see comm. ad VIII.45.11. Contra Ge and Re, I take it with
√vakṣ ‘strengthen’, not √vac.</p>
<h2 id="viii36-indra">VIII.36 Indra</h2>
<p>The meter of vss. 1-6 of this hymn is analyzed by Arnold (p. 248, E73) as
consisting of 6 pādas: 12 12 / 8 8 8 8, and this arrangement of the stanzas is followed
by HvN. Old disputes this, suggesting instead 12 8 4 / 8 12 4 8. (On the lack of
accent on śatakrato, which he takes as a separable 4-syll. sequence, see his remarks
on II.22.3.) Among other things, this division allows sám apsujít to be an
independent sequence, as it is in its occurrences in Uṣṇih, VIII.13.2 and IX.106.3. On
this expression see comm. ad VIII.13.2.
VIII.36.2–3: Somewhat unusual 2nd ps. reflexive using the standard 2nd ps. pronoun:
2a áva tvā́m “help yourself,” 3a ávasi … tvā́m. The accent on the verb in 3 is
probably the textbook example of an implicitly contrastive accented verb, with
predicates preceding and following.</p>

<h3 id="viii367">VIII.36.7</h3>
<p>This verse breaks out of the rigid structural mold of the first six verses, but
note that it also echoes vs. 1: 1a avitā́si sunvatáḥ / 7a, c sunvatáḥ … āvitha.</p>
<h2 id="viii37-indra">VIII.37 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii371">VIII.37.1</h3>
<p>Although this hymn of the twinset of VIII.36–37 is the domain of the
kṣatrā́ni ‘lordly powers’, it begins with the bráhman- that ended the last hymn and
provided its key word, also echoing that verse in other ways (āvitha, sunvatáḥ).
Ge takes sunvatáḥ as acc. pl., but given the connections between the two
hymns and the fact that sunvatáh in VIII.36 is gen. sg. in both the first and last verses
of VIII.36, I find this unlikely.
There are some difficulties in distributing the words in the refrain pādas.
Given its regular recurrence, sacīpate ‘o lord of power’ should be the first word of
the refrain, but given its lack of accent it must be the last word of the non-refrain
pādas. Nonetheless I have tr. it with the refrain. Also problematic is unaccented
anedya, which comes at the end of a pāda already twelve syllables long and should
therefore not belong to it. Old discusses but doesn’t really solve.</p>
<h3 id="viii372">VIII.37.2</h3>
<p>Note that sehānáḥ … pṛ́tanāḥ in the new material of this verse picks up a
phrase in the refrain of VIII.36 víśvāḥ séhānáḥ pṛ́tanāḥ.
VIII.38 Indra and Agni
VIII.38.1–3: The referent of tásya in the refrain pāda is not specified. It must fall into
the cultic sphere, but could be ‘sacrifice’ or ‘hymn’ or, perhaps best, since it’s
explicit in a nearby hymn by the same poet, ‘call’: VIII.35.4 bódhataṃ hávasya me.</p>
<h3 id="viii382">VIII.38.2</h3>
<p>I adopt Brugmann’s suggestion (presented and generally endorsed by Old,
also Scar 417–18) to read <em>tośā́</em>sarathayā́vānā for tośā́sā ratha… Scar assembles an
impressive number of passages involving sarátham/saráthā and √yā, incl. I.108.1
dedicated to Indra and Agni. The suggestion has the merit of eliminating the
supposed s-stem tośás- with its apparent anomalous uṣás-like inflection with
lengthened grade in the strong form tośā́saḥ. The dual to the thematic tośá-, tośā́
exactly as here, is found in an Indra and Agni hymn III.12.4. The change does
require going against the Pp. and also emending sā to sa. The publ. tr. should have an
asterisk before “driving on the same chariot.”
As for tośá-, Gotō discusses it at length (166–68), rejecting the old gloss as
‘drip’ in favor of ‘hasten’; his redefinition is accepted by Mayrhofer (EWA s.v. TOŚ,
replacing KEWA’s ‘drip’). Because the anodyne ‘hasten’ can fit almost any verb in
the RV (and in fact the old RVicist joke is that, judging from Ge et sim., all verbs in
the RV mean ‘shine’, ‘hasten’, or ‘sing’), there is nothing in the usage of the forms of
this root that imposes ‘hasten’ (or excludes it). That Gotō labels his reinterpretation
“plausibler” than the older one shows once again a certain deafness to metaphor and
a penchant for the semantic lowest common denominator. Moreover, that most of its
subjects are liquids supports the old rendering ‘drip’. The only preverb with which it
is found is ní ‘down’. Verbs of hastening (etc.) generally take a variety of directional
preverbs, of which ní is one of the rarest and most specialized; dripping, on the other
hand, goes in only one direction, down. Gotō’s ‘hasten’ gets little or no support from
the Iranian evidence he adduces (168 n. 275), which is quite weak and questioned
even by him. Although as ‘drip’ √tuś has no good etymology either (see KEWA s.v.
tóśate), I see no reason to replace it with ‘hasten’ without better evidence. In our
passage ‘streaming’ probably reflects the same metaphor in English for speed. Or,
like nitóśana- in VIII.25.23, it could mean ‘overflowing’ (with goods) and refer to
the anticipated generosity of the gods.</p>
<h3 id="viii383">VIII.38.3</h3>
<p>Pāda a can of course be in the acc. (not nom. as I take it) and form a single
sentence with b (so Ge). There are no implications either way, but I prefer to take
fronted forms of ayám as annunciatory (“here is …”) if at all possible. However,
given initial imā́(5a) and imā́m (6a), which can’t be so tr., this is not a strong arg.</p>
<h3 id="viii385">VIII.38.5</h3>
<p>Pāda b is somewhat awkward because it states that both Indra and Agni
carry oblations. Ge gets out of the difficulty by making the oblations an acc. of goal
with an intransitive reading of ūháthuḥ (“… ihr zu den Opfergaben gefahren sind”),
but Old convinces me (ad I.84.18, with a number of parallel passages) that we cannot
sidestep the transitivity in these expressions (√vah + oblation(s)). In this particular
case we can attribute the transitive phrase to a feature of Indra and Agni hymns noted
in the publ. intro., that both gods get credited with actions or qualities appropriate to
only one of them, and Agni is of course the conveyor of oblations par excellence.</p>
<h3 id="viii386">VIII.38.6</h3>
<p>Both Ge and Re take gāyatrá- as a technical reference to the Gāyatrī meter
and poems composed in it (also vs. 10); this is possible, but the stem is often used
just of a song.</p>

<p>On jenya- see comm. ad I.128.7.</p>
<h3 id="viii388">VIII.38.8</h3>
<p>I construe the Śyāvāśva genitive phrase directly with the verb, rather than
supplying ‘call’ (hávam) with Ge, on the basis of VIII.36.7, 37.7. But either is of
course possible.</p>
<h2 id="viii39-agni">VIII.39 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="viii391">VIII.39.1</h3>
<p>Ge tr. vidáthe as “den beiden gelehrten Stände,” commenting (n. 1de) that
vidátha- “ist die Autorität in gelehrten Sachen.” Following Thieme (Unters. 37ff.;
see also EWA s.v.), however, I take the stem as derived from ví √dhā ‘divide,
distribute’. In most instances (esp. in the loc. vidáthe, identical to the form here)
vidátha- refers to the ceremonial distribution of goods and, more loosely, to the
ceremony itself, but it can also refer to cosmic divisions (for other passages see
Thieme’s collection; one ex. is 9b below), and that is the referent here. The presence
of ubhé helps mark the form as a neut. dual, as opposed to the otherwise ubiquitous
loc. sg.</p>
<h3 id="viii392">VIII.39.2</h3>
<p>In c I read, with Old but contra Pp, árātīr árāva
ṇām. This does not require
emending the Saṃhitā text, but simply redividing the words.
With most interpr. I take vácaḥ synchronically as a truncated form of the instr.
vácasā to be construed with návyasā (also II.31.5, VI.48.11 in the same pāda-final
position; versus medial … návyasā vácasā … VI.62.5). However, I do not regard it
as an inherited instrumental showing deeply archaic morphology (with Hale, Fs.
Melchert, esp. 93–95), esp. since Hale sets out very persuasively the cost of
assuming such a preserved archaism (87–88), thus undercutting his own view of
vácaḥ in these passages. I am not entirely certain what gave rise to what in my view
is a synchronic, poetically generated variant. On the one hand, the expected instr. sg.
vácasā would not fit the end of any cadence in Vedic meter; the form is almost
invariably found in the break after an opening of either 4 or 5. The instr. pl. vácobhiḥ
is, by contrast, quite common pāda final in Triṣṭubh (8 of 13 forms), and I wonder if
our “instr.” vácaḥ did not originally start out from a truncation of the -bhiḥ ending to
fit into an iambic cadence (Jagatī or dimeter vs.). This of course does not get us the
instr. singular with návyasā, however. Another factor that may have contributed is
contexts in which a nom./acc. vácaḥ would be grammatically possible, with návyasā
an adverbial instr. ‘anew’. Ours is such a passage; vácaḥ here can be parallel to
śáṃsam ‘laud’, hence “(set) down … anew a speech, a laud …” (also suggested by
Scar 392 n. 544). Then analyzed as an abbreviated instr. because of its proximity to
návyasā, the phrase could be used in passages in which a nom./acc. vácaḥ is excluded.
The tr. just suggested depends crucially on accepting my interpr. of pāda b,
against that of Ge (see also Gr, Scar 392). The questions are the positive or negative
value of śáṃsam and the referent of unaccented eṣām. Most take the latter as
referring to the árāvṇām of the following pāda, but, strictly speaking, unaccented
forms of ayám should refer to something already in the discourse. Although the
proximity of the two forms might allow árāvṇām to “count” as already in the
discourse, I would prefer to find a referent preceding eṣām, and devā́n in 1c is
available. This also allows us to interpr. śáṃsa- in its more common positive usage
‘laud’, rather than the rare (though definitely attested) negative sense (see, e.g.,
III.18.2 śáṃsam áraruṣaḥ, with a gen. akin to our árāvṇām).
We thus have two parallel expressions, pādas ab and cd, each beginning with
ní and lacking a verb. I supply √dhā for both, with slightly different senses: ‘set
down (upon)’ for ab and ‘put down’ in the idiomatic sense also found in English
(though without the English specialization to speech) for cd. For √dhā with tanū́ṣu,
see, e.g., I.85.3, III.19.5, III.53.18; for śáṃsam √dhā + loc. of god, see X.42.6a
yásmin vayáṁ dadhimā́śáṁsam índre “Indra, upon whom we have set our laud” (lit.
“upon which Indra we have set our laud”).</p>
<h3 id="viii393">VIII.39.3</h3>
<p>prá cikiddhi presents the usual problem of forms of √cit: does this fall in
the intransitive ‘appear, be perceived’ range or I/T ‘perceive’? I have opted for the
latter, since Agni is regularly called prácetas-, which I interpr. as ‘discerning,
provident’. But Ge and Re go for the former, which is certainly not impossible and
might be supported by ciketa in 5a.</p>
<h3 id="viii394">VIII.39.4</h3>
<p>Ge supplies a different subject (“singer”) for kṛpaṇyáti in the rel. clause
than for dadhe in the preceding main clause: “so viel Kraft verlieht Agni wie immer
(der Sänger) bedarf.” This is novel, but seems unnecessary and supported neither by
context nor by parallels.
The Pp. analyzes ūrjā́hutiḥ as ūrjā́ā́hutiḥ, that is, probably with an instr. 1st
member, but Old prefers to see the 1st member as a stem form, either ūrjā́- or ūrjá-.
The latter is marginally attested in cmpds and in the verb stem ūrjáya-, probably
originally a denom. (see Jamison, -áya-, 50, 81). By Ge’s interpr. (which I follow),
gen. pl. vásūnām limits the first member of this cmpd ūrjā́huti-. This is common in
later Sanskrit, but somewhat rarer in the RV. Re (and Klein) render it backwards
(Klein, DGRV I.205–6 “whose nourishment is the oblation of the gods”), but still
with the gen. pl. limiting only one of the members. It may not be sufficiently clear in
the publ. tr. that I take the cmpd as a bahuvrīhi.
Note that both -ā́huti- (√hu ‘pour’) and -hūti- (√hū ‘call’) appear in this vs.</p>
<h3 id="viii395">VIII.39.5</h3>
<p>The standard interpr. take pratīvyàm as the obj. of inóti (e.g., Ge “er
befördert die Darbringung”), and this is certainly the simplest way. But inóti means
‘impel’, and práti √vī refers to the gods’ reception of mortals’ offerings, not the
offerings themselves (see the root noun in quasi-infinitival usage in VIII.23.1, 26.8,
and finite passages like VIII.101.10), so the simpler syntax requires attenuating the
meanings of both words. I therefore complicate the surface syntax somewhat by
supply an obj. to inóti extracted from dákṣiṇābhiḥ in pāda c and making pratīvyàm
the goal. If the infinitival sense of pratīvyàm in its other two occurrences is
maintained here, it could be tr. “impels (them) to be received.”</p>
<h3 id="viii396">VIII.39.6</h3>
<p>As pointed out in the publ. intro., pādas ab contain a pun &ndash; which Ge fails
to note and Re mentions in his n. but fails to render in his translation. Agni “knows
the races” (jātā́… veda) of gods and men. Those two words in that order produce his
common epithet Jātavedas. I take apīcyàm ‘hidden, secret’ at the end of b as a
separate clause, alluding to this pun: “(this is his) secret (name).” (The publ. tr.
should have “name” in parentheses.) apīcyàm (-āni) almost always qualifies ‘name’,
including two hymns later by the same poet (VIII.41.5 … apīcyā̀/ véda nā́māni
gúhyā). Both Ge and Re instead take apīcyàm as a separate object of veda, construed
with márt(i
y)ānām, while jātā́is limited only by devā́nām (“knows the races of the
gods and the secret [/Re ‘specificity’] of mortals”), though gods and mortals are
frequently a merism. My view that apīcyàm is a separate clause is supported by the
meter. Mahāpaṅkti consists only of 8-syllable pādas, and 6b should end after
márt(i
y)ānām. In fact, Old in his Prol. suggested deleting the following apīcyàm, but
in the Noten thinks better of it, allowing a 4-syllable pendant to this line. This
pendant is, in my interpr., syntactically independent and a sort of meta-comment.
In e Ge supplies ghee with návīyasā: “mit erneutem (Opferschmalz).” This of
course is more semantically harmonious with svā̀hutaḥ ‘bepoured’, but betrays a sad
lack of poetic sensibility. The stem návīyas- is regularly used of verbal products, and
it narrowly echoes návyasā vácaḥ of 2a. Moreover, 3ab contains an example of the
trope “pour prayers” (there explicitly compared to ghee: mánmāni … ghṛtáṃ ná
juhve). This expression svā̀huto návīyasā economically combines the “newer speech”
of 2 and the “pouring prayers” of 3, using both √hu (from 3) and náv(ī)yas- (from 2).
The poet could hardly have made his metaphorical intent clearer. (Re is only a bit
less flat-footed than Ge; he gives návīyasā the correct referent [hymne], but still
sneaks in a supplied beurre fondu to construe with svā̀hutaḥ.)</p>
<h3 id="viii397">VIII.39.7</h3>
<p>Gr derives sáṃvasu- from √vas ‘dwell’, and Ge’s “Hausgenosse” reflects
this derivation (see also AiG II.1.75). But Old argues that it contains vásu- ‘good(s)’
and compares sahávasu-, vásubhiḥ sáha, an analysis accepted by Debrunner (AiG
II.1 Nachtr. 24, AiG II.2.471), Re, and me.
With the standard tr., I take víśvam bhū́meva as a two-member simile, acc. +
nom. A passage two hymns away in the same cycle, VIII.41.5 sá kavíḥ kā́vyā purú,
rūpáṃ dyaúr iva puṣyati “he is a poet who fosters the many poetic arts, as heaven
does its (concrete) form,” makes this analysis pretty much inescapable. But I am still
somewhat concerned by the position of the iva (in both passages), following the 2nd
element of the simile rather than the first, and víśvam bhū́ma ‘the whole earth’ would
also be a possible NP.</p>
<h3 id="viii398">VIII.39.8</h3>
<p>“Seven” here is probably a loose indication of totality (so Oberlies, II.74)
rather than a precise enumeration. The number may have been displaced from
síndhuṣu: the rivers are generally seven.
VIII.39.8, 10: I do not understand the sudden prominence of the rivers/waters, esp.
the waters that in 10e are svásetu- ‘having/being their own bridges/dams’. Ge (n.
10de) thinks it alludes to the ritual sprinkling of the fireplaces with water, which may
well be, but which does not explain the descriptor. In its other occurrence (X.61.16)
svásetu- refers to a poet who crosses the waters (apáḥ … tarati) by having or making
his own bridge. Are the waters providing Agni with a bridge for him to cross them?
It may (or may not) be relevant that the waters/rivers are fairly prominent in the next
hymn (VIII.40) to Indra and Agni.</p>

<p>The hapax vavráyāmahe is somewhat puzzling. It appears to be a denom.
to vavrá- ‘hole’, with accent retraction because it is transitive (so Jamison, -áya-,
88–89). This deriv. goes back to Bartholomae and is endorsed by Old, for want of
anything better. But what is its point in context? Here Re seems to show the way,
taking it as oppositional to the following pāda, which begins with the contrastive
particle átha: “But we sacrifice just (/especially) to Indra.” The idea is that, though
the hymn is dedicated to both Indra and Agni, we don’t put the two gods in the same
undifferentiated category, “in the (same) hole,” as it were, but treat them individually.
As noted in the publ. intro., the two gods are treated with more independence than in
most Indra and Agni hymns (which isn’t saying much).</p>
<h3 id="viii403">VIII.40.3</h3>
<p>The clauses ab and cde begin identically, with tā́. It is only with the last
two words of the final pāda, aśnutaṃ narā, that it becomes clear that a change of
person has been effected between 3rd (ab) and 2nd (cde). Unfortunately this change
has to be signalled much earlier in the Engl.</p>
<h3 id="viii404">VIII.40.4</h3>
<p>I take cde as consisting of two relative clauses, both introduced by yáyoḥ
in c. The first is only pāda c and is a statement of ownership (“whose is this whole
moving world,” phrased in the publ. tr. as “to whom … belongs”); the second
comprises de, with yáyoḥ construed with vásu and Heaven and Earth the subj. of the
dual verb bibhṛtáḥ. (Re’s tr. is sim.) Ge’s tr. differs from mine in taking cde as a
single relative cl., with “this whole moving world” as a parallel subj. to Heaven and
Earth. He must assume that bibhṛtáḥ has been attracted into the dual by the nearer
paired subject. I prefer to take the dual verb seriously, and I also wonder if the
moving world (which usually refers to the animate beings therein) has a collective
lap. For the lap of Heaven and Earth, see nearby VIII.42.2 pātáṁ no dyāvāprthiv ̥ ī
upásthe (in the same hymn cycle).
Judging by word order, iyáṃ dyaúḥ should belong together and I have so tr.
them. But iyám has the wrong deixis: iyám expresses near deixis and, when
indicating a cosmic division, ordinarily characterizes the earth (cf., e.g., X.60.9 iyám
prthiv ̥ ī́mahī́). It also has the dispreferred gender: dyaúḥ is ordinarily masc., though
occasionally fem. Since demonstratives are often separated from their nouns, I am
tempted to take it with pṛthivī́here (“heaven and this great earth”). But a series of
passages in which the feminine near deictic does seem to belong with ‘heaven’
(prthiv ̥ ī́ṃ dyā́m utémā́m III.32.8, 34.8, X.88.3, 9, 121.1) gives me pause, and IX.96.3
dyā́m utémā́m is even worse, because it is not conjoined with an ‘earth’ word. So I
have honored the word order as well as accepting the gender switch.</p>
<h3 id="viii405">VIII.40.5</h3>
<p>What this is about is not entirely clear. Ge suggests Vala, while Lüders, fld.
by Re, thinks of the heavenly ocean (as usual).
That -bāra- ‘bank’ is a MIA development of pārá- ‘(far) shore’ (KEWA s.v.
jihmáḥ, EWA s.v. pārá-) seems plausible.</p>
<h3 id="viii406">VIII.40.6</h3>
<p>Both vratáti- and guṣpitá- are found in the RV only here, but are attested
later &ndash; the latter already AV.
The meter of de is faulty, with two extra syllables. Which pāda is hypermetric
depends on which one vásu is assigned to: Old (Prol.) and Lub put it final in d, HvN
initial in e. In favor of the former is vásu’s general preference for pāda-final position
and, in particular, the final of 4e, with a form of √bhṛ + vásu (bibhṛtó vásu). Old
(Noten) explicitly counsels against omitting it as others have suggested. It would be
possible to eliminate another disyllable, e.g., pleonastic vayám, but there is no strong
reason to.</p>
<h3 id="viii407">VIII.40.7</h3>
<p>Ge and Re tr. indrāgnī́as voc., without commenting on accent. I assume
this is simply a lapse on their parts.</p>
<h3 id="viii408">VIII.40.8</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take uccárātaḥ as the verb of all of ab, whose action unfolds
“under heaven” (unterhalb des Himmels), but the contrast between aváḥ ‘down’ and
úd ‘up’ invites an interpr. of cyclical complementary action &ndash; the rising and setting
of the two heavenly bodies. I therefore supply a verb of motion with pāda a.
I read pāda c with both ab and d.</p>
<h3 id="viii409">VIII.40.9</h3>
<p>In my interpr. the verse is structured by two complementary pairings of
reciprocal gifts between “us” and Indra. Both involve Indra’s gifts (úpamātayaḥ a,
āpṛ́caḥ d) and our praiseful thoughts (práśastayaḥ b, dhíyaḥ e).
úpamāti- is variously rendered, but I take it to úpa √mā ‘mete out’; cf., e.g.,
VII.26.5 sahasríṇa úpa no māhi vā́jān “mete out prizes to us in thousands.” Ge’s
‘Zuwendungen’ (‘contributions, donations’, but also ‘care’) could belong either to
√mā or to √man, but I surmise he links it to the former. Both Gr and Re connect it to
the realm of speech/thought (‘Anrede’ and ‘pensées-appliquées’ respectively) with
Gr explicitly positing a root affiliation with √man. Re gives no disc. in his comm. ad
loc. (EVP 14), but in EVP 16 (ad IV.43.4) he rejects a root affiliation with √mā. Cf.
also his comments in EVP 13.155 (ad VIII.60.11). A root syllable mā cannot be
derived from the aniṭ root √man in any straightforward fashion, though AiG II.2.630
derives both úpamāti- and abhímāti- from -mati- via metrical lengthening, citing
Meillet. Metrical lengthening is, of course, a non-explanation except under very
controlled conditions, and the fact that other compounds with -mati- (e.g., metrically
identical ánumati-) maintain the short vowel make it even less likely in this case.
In both d and e I supply ‘many’, based on the parallelism with ab pūrvī́ḥ …,
pūrvī́ḥ &hellip; HvN’s loosing of the sandhi in d as vīrásya apṛ́caḥ is incorrect: the initial
vowel is ā-, which is supported by the meter and so given by the Pp (see Scar 324).
Ge takes āpṛ́caḥ as adjectival modifying dhíyaḥ, but I follow Old’s interpr. (so also
Scar 324–25) as a nom. act.; the vásvaḥ with it is an objective gen., the vīrásya a
subjective gen.</p>
<h3 id="viii4010">VIII.40.10</h3>
<p>The “eggs” of Śuṣṇa are probably his progeny (so Old, Ge); see X.68.7,
adduced by Ge, also X.22.11 śúṣṇasya &hellip; jātáṃ víśvaṃ and X.61.13 śúṣṇasya …
puruprajātásya. They can’t be testicles, given the number.
The standard interpr. takes jéṣat (e) as parallel to bhédati (d) and still part of
the rel. clause beginning in c, whereas I take it as the verb of the main clause to
which the rel. clause is attached. Either is grammatically possible because, if jéṣat is
the verb of a main clause, its accent is owing to its initial position. The rel. cl. interpr.
requires that cde all hang off the tám of a, despite the utá. Klein (DGRV I.302) seems
to suggest that the verse is structured as an “X and which Y construction” (tám …
utá … yáḥ), but as far as I know, the X and Y in such constructions always have
different referents.</p>
<h3 id="viii4011">VIII.40.11</h3>
<p>This verse, dedicated to Agni, is constructed entirely parallel to vs. 10 to
Indra; note, e.g., the end of the b pādas: 10 … sátvānam ṛgmíyam, 11 … sátvānam
ṛtvíyam. It therefore seems important to construe the exactly parallel cde in the same
way in both verses. The only differences between the two are ójasā (10c) / óhata [-e
out of sandhi] (11c), the order of Śuṣṇa and his eggs in d, and the tense/mood of the
verb in e (s-aor. subj. jéṣat in 10e, s-aor. indic. ájaiḥ in 11e). My tr. reflects this strict
parallelism, but others do not. Ge, e.g., takes d as the main cl. to c and e as a second
independent cl., whereas in 10 he takes cde as a single rel. clause (see above). Klein,
DGRV I.302, calls 11 “an awkward attempt to create a vertical parisyllablic
responsio to 10a–e.” My tr. is made possible by taking óhate as passive (‘is
proclaimed as …’) (or possibly reflexive ‘vaunts himself as’; see V.42.11).</p>

<p>I don’t understand the purport of this vs., esp. de. Ge and Re suggest
various possible referents for the vénīḥ and for the three dawns, all possible and none
particularly compelling.
I supply sasvaje with the pári in c, on the basis of pári ṣasvaje in a. Ge and Re
construe the pāda without a verb (e.g., Ge: “er ist rings um die Welt sichtbar”). This
is possible.</p>
<h3 id="viii414-1">VIII.41.4</h3>
<p>The hapax sáptya- is problematic. Most (though not Ge) take it as a
derivative of saptá ‘7’ (e.g., Re ‘la septuplicité’, a fine coinage) and point to
Varuṇa’s 7 sisters in 2e. His control over the 7 in 9e is perhaps more relevant. Ge tr.
“treue Freundschaft”; though he does not comment, he must derive it from sápti-,
though the standard view of the meaning of the latter is now ‘team’ and those
meanings seem quite distinct. If the word belongs with sápti-, which I think more
likely than a connection with saptá (though 9e now gives me pause), it should mean
something like ‘teamwork, cooperation’. The problem is that in this hymn Varuṇa is
credited with doing everything on his own; his usual companions, Mitra and
Aryaman, are absent. I therefore tentatively suggest that it is based on a syncopated
form (sa-pti-) from a putative *sa-páti-, hence ‘joint leadership/lordship’ à
‘leadership, master-ship’. This is a very fragile suggestion, I realize.</p>

<h3 id="viii416-1">VIII.41.6</h3>
<p>The iva in the simile is also displaced to the right, as in the previous vs.
The simile is also more complex than it first appears. The obvious way to render it is
“In whom are fixed all poetic arts like the nave in a wheel,” with Varuṇa the wheel
and the poetic arts the nave, but the more likely image is that the spokes are fit into
the nave &ndash; with Varuṇa the nave and the unexpressed spokes the poetic arts.
I have no idea what or who tritá- stands for.
The images in de are also somewhat skewed. Ge takes the two pādas
separately, with d a nominal sentence with infinitival saṃyúje as predicate, despite
the yoking vocabulary common to both pādas. He must do that because the gā́vaḥ in
d must be nom., but corresponds logically to the acc. áśvān in e. Old suggests taking
gā́vaḥ as acc. (as also possibly in IX.24.2, on which see comm. ad loc.). I take the
two pādas together, classifying it as another example of case disharmony in a simile
(Jamison 1982), enabled by the syntactic multifunctionality of the infinitival saṃyúje,
yujé (with both act. and pass. readings). Scar’s attempt (431) to construe the two
pādas together and also account for the cases shows the pitfalls, as it wanders off into
fanciful territory.</p>

<p>The purport of this verse and the referents of the unidentified fem. pl. (āsu,

might fit together. I roughly follow Old’s interpr., but cannot carry it further.</p>

<p>Pl. víprā(ḥ) ‘poets’ is taken as a second conjoined subj. by Ge (“die

<p>With Old I take ástṛta-yajvan- as a karmadhāraya, not the bahuvrīhi of Ge

<h3 id="viii433">VIII.43.3</h3>
<p>Ge takes ārokā́ḥ (only here in RV) as “Maschen” (mesh), and this does
seem to be the meaning in late Vedic. This idiomatic sense presumably developed
from ‘light flashing through openings’ to the ‘openings’ themselves. However, mesh
or netting does not seem a particularly apt comparison here, and I prefer to take the
word in a more literal, but still concrete, sense, esp. since rocate appears several
times in the hymn (8c, 10b). By ‘brilliants’ I mean gems or gem-like objects
(rhinestones, e.g., had they been invented then) that catch and flash light. A more
abstract sense, like ‘flashes’ or ‘flares’, risks near identity with what it’s being
compared with (tvíṣaḥ).
The force of the particle pile-up ghéd áha is not entirely clear to me, but this
poet is partial to it. See ghéd … áhā in 30, as well as ghéd in 29, áha in 8. I have not
found ghéd (…) áha elsewhere in the RV.
VIII.43.4–5: vṛ́thak is found only in these two vss. It is generally considered to be a
formal cross of vṛ́thā ‘at will’ with pṛ́thak ‘separately’ (see EWA s.v., AiG III.231,
Re ad loc.), a form of which appears in repeated pādas later in the hymn (18b=29b),
and to maintain the semantics of the former (Ge ‘jäh’ [‘precipitously’ &ndash; a rather
extended sense], Re ‘à leur gré’). Sāy, however, simply glosses it as pṛthak. I am
reluctantly sympathetic to Sāy’s opinion, as ‘at will’ does not fit the contexts well,
esp. 5a. (Both Ge and Re tr. it with pāda b in 4, not in its proper place.) X.91.7 ā́te
yatante rathyò yáthā pṛ́thak, adduced by Ge, echoes our 4c. The publ. tr. reflects the
Sāy gloss. However, on returning to this passage, I find the Sāy solution too
convenient and entirely unmotivated, but still remain unsatisfied with the connection
with vṛ́thā and its suggested crossing with pṛ́thak. That the formation of both vṛ́thā
and prthak ̥́ is murky does not help. I do not have anything resembling a solution, but
I’m inclined to think that ví ‘apart’ is somehow implicated. Perhaps via an
(unfortunately unattested) -añc-stem, *vi
yañc- ‘facing separate directions’, whose
neut. adv. *vi
yak could have been assimilated to pṛ́thak given their similiarity of
meaning. Cf. the similarly formed víṣvañc- ‘facing in separate directions’, whose
neut. appears two hymns later in a suggestive collocation, VIII.45.8 … víṣvag yáthā.</p>

<p>Assuming with the Pp., Macd. (VGS §48a), and Lub (s.v. sá) that

cf. I.103.5, X.88.10 sá óṣadhīḥ. The sá with 2nd ps. reference also does not conform
to my rules for this usage, as it is not in an imperatival clause. I do not have an
answer, though poetic factors may have had some influence: note the preceding pāda
(ap)sú &hellip; sádhi(ṣ) …, which is a good match for the three syllables in saúṣadhī(r).

<p>I prefer to maintain the older gloss ‘kiss’ for niṃs rather than flg. Gotō

if níṃsa- is in origin a redupl. pres. to √nas, passages like this, with múkhe ‘on the

‘approach’, used metaphorically or euphemistically.</p>

<p>īmahe is formally ambiguous and could also mean ‘approach’; Ge’s “wir

<p>agne has to be tr. “Fire,” rather than the usual “Agni,” because otherwise
the verbal play is lost. The constant interplay in the RV between physical fire and the

<h3 id="viii4317">VIII.43.17</h3>
<p>Despite the case disharmony between acc. tvā in a and the dat. phrase in
b, I take them both as referring to Agni (so also Old). Ge takes the dat. in b as part of
the simile in c, referring to a calf awaiting the cows coming to its stall. (Re’s tr.
seems to combine the two.) But vs. 2a ásmai te pratiháryate (and cf. VIII.44.2 práti
… harya) establishes Agni as the primary referent here, though a secondary
connection with a calf (via the bellowing) isn’t impossible. As for the case difference,
vs. 2 provides a possible solution, since the verb there is jánāmi ‘I generate’,
construed with the dat. of benefit. Hence my “(praises generated)” here.</p>

<p>With Ge I supply daha in b, with the preverb práti, since práti is not
otherwise found with √pā, the verb of pāda a, but is common with √dah ‘burn’. Cf.
esp. I.12.15 práti ṣma ríṣataḥ daha. VII.15.13b is identical to our pāda, and the verb
in pāda c of that vs. is daha, which governs the acc. in b.</p>
<h3 id="viii4426">VIII.44.26</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., Agni is repeatedly referred to as both
‘inspired poet’ (vípra-) and ‘sage poet’ (kaví-) in this hymn, sometimes with the
3
words in the same vs. (12, 21). Here -vépas-, belonging to the root of vípra-, √vip
‘tremble, become inspired’, co-occurs with kaví-, filling the contrastive vípra- role.</p>
<h3 id="viii4427">VIII.44.27</h3>
<p>The root affiliation of iṣema is not entirely clear. Lub puts it with √iṣ
‘send’, but the case frame is wrong. But an affiliation with √iṣ ‘desire’ is even less
likely. With Ge and Re I take it as meaning ‘hasten’ or the like and note the
connection of the pāda, stómair iṣemāgnáye, with VIII.43.11c stómair vidhemāgnáye
in the immediately preceding hymn, with iṣema a near-rhyme with vidhema in an
otherwise identical pāda. Re suggests that the form and the syntactic construction
have been borrowed from VIII.43.11, but doesn’t explain what verb we’re starting
with (though I surmise ‘send’). So perhaps substituting for “we would send praises to
Agni.”</p>

<p>The bunda bow is the weapon Indra uses to kill the boar Emuṣa, in a rarely

<h3 id="viii455">VIII.45.5</h3>
<p>Śavasī is taken by many as the name of Indra’s mother, but there is no
particular reason not to take it in its lexical sense, referring to the same woman.
The Pp. text divides the beginning of b into girā́v ápso, with the second word
the s-stem ápsas- ‘breast’, a word otherwise used of Uṣas (I.124.7, V.80.6). But even
in a proverbial expression such as this seems to be, where semantic latitude is to be
expected, “like a/the breast/chest at a mountain” (or Ge “Wie mit der Brust gegen
den Berg &hellip;,” taking ápsaḥ as a truncated instr. *ápsasā) doesn’t make any sense. Old
suggests a different word division: girā́vápso, with the latter being the word for
‘wasp’ found elsewhere in Indo-European, though not directly in Indo-Aryan (except,
quite possibly, in I.181.8); see EWA s.v. vápsas-. This does allow sense to be made
of the expression: the extraordinary size difference between a wasp and a mountain
dooms the wasp, but wasps are notoriously belligerent and therefore willing to take
on any opponent, however unlikely they are to defeat it. In the same way, anyone
who is foolhardy enough to take on Indra will ensure certain defeat for himself.</p>
<h3 id="viii456">VIII.45.6</h3>
<p>The rest of Indra’s mother’s advice (if she is the speaker) implicitly

<p>Assuming that the syntagm of the simile is víṣvag yáthā “as if víṣvak,” that
is, “as if asunder,” I have slightly reconfigured the expression to conform to an
English idiom. Ge seems to take the yáthā as expressing purpose, “dass sie
zerschellen” (be smashed to pieces) but I do not understand how víṣvak can be
configured as a verb.
Note the alliteration ví ṣú víśvā &hellip; vájrin víṣvag … vṛha, esp. ví ṣú víśvā &hellip;
víṣvag.</p>
<h3 id="viii4510">VIII.45.10</h3>
<p>Ge takes b and c together as a single clause and has gómataḥ modify te

28 below. And áram is used elsewhere as predicate of a nominal clause.</p>
<h3 id="viii4511">VIII.45.11</h3>
<p>There is no expressed referent in this verse, and Gr (s.v. áśvāvant-, etc.)
indicates that it is “we” of vs. 10. However, Ge supplies “soma drops,” esp. on the
strength of VIII.49.4 and the fact that vivákṣana- is always used of soma. This seems
correct. The question is the meaning and root affiliation of vivákṣana-. Ge tr.
‘redselig machend’, connecting it thus with √vac, while I prefer to take it to √vakṣ
‘become / make strong’, as a transitive -ana-nominal, beside vákṣaṇa- also
‘strengthening’. The connection with √vakṣ is asserted by Old ad X.21.1 (fld. by AiG
II.2.198). See also EWA s.v. VAKṢ, esp. p. 487; he does not decide.</p>

<p>The logical relation between the subordinate clause (ab) and main clause

that he will continue to be generous to us despite our failings.</p>

<p>mahé was mistakenly omitted in the publ. tr. Substitute “to great

I follow Old in taking góparīṇasā as standing for -āḥ, nom. pl. to a thematic
stem, rather than, with Ge (and Pp.), as -ā and instr. sg. of the s-stem. In the simplex
both párīṇas- and parīṇasá- exist, though the latter occurs only once (IX.97.9),
where it is indirectly associated with cows/milk. Old points out that soma is
generally the subject of √mand (as in 14b mandantu … índavaḥ), and taking
góparīṇasā(ḥ) here as modifying a plural form of soma drinks or drops would save
having to supply another element in the instrumental. However, Ge’s interpretation
does have in its favor that the more common simplex is párīṇas- and that it is
regularly found in the instrumental.

VIII.45.25–27: The proclamation of Indra’s deeds called for in 25c is presumably
contained in the following two verses.</p>
<h3 id="viii4526">VIII.45.26</h3>
<p>Gr takes sahásrabāhve (with distraction, -bāhuve) as belonging to a ustem and as a poetic synonym for ‘battle’. I find this suggestion quite attractive,
though this type of kenning is somewhat unusual for the RV. Ge and Old (see also
EWA s.v. bāhú-; Mayrhofer PN) take it as a thematized -bāhva- in the locative as a
PN (Ge: “bei Sahasrabāhva”). Though Gr’s interpretation gives the richer semantics,
the problem is of course that the dative sg. should be –bāhave, not –bāh u
ve. AiG
III.139 also identifies it as a thematic locative, but allows a lexical meaning “in der
tausendarmigen Schlacht,” flg. Sommer). I still think it may be a dative, with the
alternative -ve ending (e.g., páśve beside paśáve), but a locative with lexical value is
also possible.</p>
<h3 id="viii4527-1">VIII.45.27</h3>
<p>Ge takes vídānaḥ as belonging to √vid ‘know’ and construes it with the
preceding PNs: “Das ist wahr, bei Turvaśa und Yadu bekannt.” It is true that the
participle vídāna- ordinarily belongs to √vid ‘know’, but it is usually passive and
appears with a predicate, “known as X.” The idiom envisioned here, “known to,” I’m
not at all sure is a Sanskrit expression, though it works well in German and English. I
therefore take the participle as belonging to √vid ‘find’, whose middle generally
means ‘acquire’, with the soma “not to be spurned” (ahnavāyyám) as object. Turvaśa
and Yadu offer soma to the gods elsewhere; cf. VIII.9.14 imé sómāso ádhi turváśe
yádau. Ge takes ahnavāyyám with vy ā̀naṭ (“hat er nicht Abzustreitendes erreicht”),
which prevents him from construing that verb with turváṇe as it is in the parallel he
himself cites (VIII.12.19 ádhā yajñā́ya turváṇe vyā̀naśuḥ). His rendering of the last
two words of the pāda as purpose infinitival clause (“dass der fromme Dienst
triumphiere”) involves what seems to me a dubious construal of śámi.</p>
<h3 id="viii4528">VIII.45.28</h3>
<p>jánānām may go with taráṇim, as Ge takes it (“Den Durchhelfer der
Menschen”); I construe it with b, because taráṇi- doesn’t otherwise take a genitive.</p>
<h3 id="viii4530">VIII.45.30</h3>
<p>The lexeme nír √i ‘go out’ is specialized for birth contexts, to go out of
the womb, so yonyá- as a descriptor of the mountain is particularly apt.</p>
<h3 id="viii4531">VIII.45.31</h3>
<p>For the odd sentiments of this verse and what follows, see the intro. Both
Ge and Old supply an object to the first verb (dadhiṣe), an object drawn from ritual
(Ge “das Opfer,” Old “Lob u. degl., Somatränke”), but this seems unduly restrictive.
I think that the poet is apprehensive about the consequences of whatever Indra might
undertake.
VIII.45.37–38: For my interpretation of this bit of dialogue, see the publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="viii4537">VIII.45.37</h3>
<p>On the basis both of the content of the verse and the use of the voc.
maryāḥ, I consider this verse to be Indra’s address to the Maruts. The plural of maryá
6
in all clear cases refers to the Maruts. And in VIII.96.7–8 the Maruts address Indra,
reminding him that all the other gods but them deserted him, using the same √īṣ
‘shrink from’ as is found here.
Ge takes ámithitaḥ as “ohne Zank” (without a quarrel), but I think it refers
instead to Indra’s potentially friendless state &ndash;‘unpaired’ – a fear expressed by the
poet in the immediately preceding verse (36). The hypothetical speaker still has a
comrade (sákhā sákhāyam), but, like one unpaired, threatens to say to this comrade
“I’m leaving.”
The form jahā́is taken by Ge (and others) as a 3rd sg. pf. to √hā and therefore,
implicitly, a precious example of a 3rd sg. pf. to a long-ā root without -au ending.
However, Old very persuasively suggests that it is a 1st sg. subjunctive in the direct
speech introduced by abravīt. Although to the reduplicated present of √hā we would
expect accent on the reduplication (*jáhā), Old argues that the fluctuation of accent
in IIIrd class presents makes the accent irrelevant. I would alternatively suggest that
it could be a subjunctive to the perfect stem. See Old’s extensive discussion of the
various previous proposals about this form.</p>
<h3 id="viii4538">VIII.45.38</h3>
<p>I consider this verse the Maruts’ insulted response to Indra’s insults,
couched in a very slangy register. The first sign of this speech level is the voc. are (to
arí- ‘stranger’), a vocative not otherwise found in the RV, but remember the Pāli and
Pkt. “interjections” are, ale, clearly derived from this voc. (Thieme, Fremdl. 3–4), as
well as the famous shibboleth he ‘lavo of ŚB III.2.1.23, consisting of an l-form of the
plural voc. of this word in MIA guise (see EWA, KEWA s.v.). Its use as a shibboleth
and with an l-form suggests popular speech.
Note also the lengthened voc. vṛṣabhā (also in 22a). Lengthened vocatives are
quite rare in the RV; AiG III.96–97 cites only these two forms, but remarks that pluti
vocatives were surely a feature of living speech, found in the Brāhmaṇas and in Pāli
and the Prākrits. The use of the well-known gambling term svaghnī́also marks the
speech as low register. The substance of the Maruts’ counter-accusations is that Indra
greedily drank up the soma offered to him below (that is, among men). I’ve used the
expression “lower depths” to refer to the louche aspects of a gambling place (and
also possibly to the depression in the ground where the dicing happens). Indra carried
on arrogantly and without sharing the soma, but then, they say, when he got into a
jam in the Vrtra ̥ battle he suddenly remembered he had pals and upbraided them for
desertion.</p>
<h3 id="viii4539">VIII.45.39</h3>
<p>Unfortunately this last verse of the tṛca does not seem to have any
connection with the foregoing Indra-Marut dialogue. The &ldquo;I&rdquo; is presumably not a
Marut, but the poet or other ritual officiant, and it’s difficult to know how his holding
on to the horses will bring about Indra’s gifts. Is he holding them hostage, as it were,
not allowing them to leave the ritual ground and return to heaven (recall the “Fallowbay-yoking libation” that ends I.61–63 and sends Indra and his horses back home at
the end of the sacrifice) until Indra distributes the goods? Or is he helpfully holding
7
them to leave Indra’s hands free? Given the aggressive tone of the previous two
verses, I favor the former idea.</p>
<h3 id="viii4540">VIII.45.40</h3>
<p>On pári bā́dhaḥ see comm. ad IX.105.6. Both there and here I suggest a
haplology of the finite impv. bādhasva, in the putative sequence pári *bādhasva
bā́dhaḥ &ndash; rather than accepting the BR / Gr emendation to *paribā́dhaḥ, accepted by
Old. If we accept that emendation and make *paribā́dhaḥ another acc. obj. of jahī́,
parallel to mṛ́dhaḥ, the accent on jahī́is unexplained.</p>
<h3 id="viii4542">VIII.45.42</h3>
<p>viśvámānuṣa- should, by accent, be a bahuvrīhi; it is also difficult to
separate from viśvámanus- in the next hymn (VIII.46.17). However, most
interpretors take it implicitly as a karmadhāraya: Gr ‘die ganze Menschenschar’, Ge
‘jedermann’, and Wackernagel (AiG II.1.266) explicitly identifies it as a tatpuruṣa
with irregular accent (‘Gesamtheit der Menschen’). But this seems unnecessary:
mā́nuṣa- regularly modifies jána- (so ‘human race’ / or ‘folk consisting of the
descendants of Manu’), and here we can supply an underlying jána-, modified by the
compound, hence ‘(races) consisting of all the people of Manu’. The publ. tr. seems
to reflect the tatpuruṣa interpretation because the more literal tr. is simply too
awkward.</p>
<h2 id="viii46-indra">VIII.46 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii466">VIII.46.6</h3>
<p>As in VI.54.8, 55.2 I take rāyáḥ as a morphological pun – both genitive sg.
depending on ī́śānaḥ and accusative pl. as object of īmahe.
VIII.46.8–9: A thematic and syntactic modulation. The yáḥ clauses of vs. 8 (which
lacks a main clause) clearly refer to Indra’s máda- ‘exhilaration’, and the yáḥ which
opens vs. 9 seems simply to continue this construction. But the 2nd hemistich is
couched in the 2nd ps. and refers to Indra, and it is possible to assume that Indra is
also the subject of ab (despite the 3rd ps. construction and the 2nd ps. vocative),
because the qualifiers in 9ab are better suited to Indra than to his máda-. (As Old
says, “Übergleiten von Indras máda zu I. selbst.”) In the end, though, it is better to
assume a covert identification of Indra and his máda-, which allows a smooth
transition from describing the latter to describing the former.</p>
<h3 id="viii4610">VIII.46.10</h3>
<p>Despite appearances, gavyó is entirely parallel to aśvayā́and rathayā́

<h3 id="viii4614">VIII.46.14</h3>
<p>Ge takes váco yáthā as a truncated clause: “soweit (es) die Rede
(vermag),” but, although accented yáthā is seldom pāda-final, unaccented yathā, the
simile marker, is almost always so placed. Therefore pāda-final yáthā here must also
be a simile marker at least in my view, but see Old for contrary opinion.
8</p>
<h3 id="viii4615">VIII.46.15</h3>
<p>Very condensed expression. The first two long pādas characterize Indra
as a giver (dadí- 3x) of various desirable things. The third pāda, a mere four syllables,
implicitly calls on Indra to actualize this identity by making the gifts.
The expression “legacy to/for the body/self” (rékṇas tanvè) probably stands
for a son, as Ge points out in his n.
The short final pāda nūnám átha is curiously formed. There are no other
examples of this word sequence, but nūnám has a tendency to be followed by a di- or
trisyllable beginining with a- (though usually heavy syl), e.g., nūnám aśyāḥ, nūnám
anyā́. Moreover, átha is almost always initial in pāda or clause, so its presence in this
position must be signalling something special, which I take to be a peremptory
command (English “now then!” corresponds nicely). Note that it echoes verse-final
yáthā of 14 and that it again takes final position at the end of 16.</p>
<h3 id="viii4616">VIII.46.16</h3>
<p>Following Old, I supply the verb “sing to” (abhí … gāya) from 14 to
govern the accusatives here.
In the publ. tr. I also followed a suggestion of Old in taking kṛpayatáḥ as acc.
pl. governed by áti, rather than gen. sg. dependent on várpasaḥ (Ge: “über diese
Gestalt des Erbarmenden”). But the syntactic distribution of elements in this verse is
very uncertain, due in part to the unclarity of the meter, where even pāda boundaries
cannot be certainly determined. In coming to the version found in the publ tr. I
reasoned that what confronts us here is a sort of syntactic śleṣa of irajyánt-, with the
uncompounded participle as usual governing the genitive in pādas a and b (víśveṣām
… vásūnām and asyá várpasaḥ), while with áti in pāda c it takes the accusative. Cf.,
with √rāj, a root with which irajyá- becomes entangled, III.10.7 ví rājasi áti srídhaḥ.
I am now not so certain: I think kṛpayatáḥ may in fact be a gen. as Ge takes it, but
that it’s construed directly with irajyánt-, not dependent on várpasaḥ &ndash; with the tr.
“(and has control) over the one who yearns (for him) in addition.” Under this interpr.
áti would be an adverbial additive ‘in addition’, adding another term to the items
over which Indra has control.
What “this form” refers to is not clear to me. I assume that it is Indra’s form,
quite possibly one of the multiforms that he takes on at will
Since nūnám … átha reprises 15c, I find the interpolation of the áti puzzling,
especially if it governs a previous nominal form. However, the poet (who seems to
have little conscience about syntax) may have inserted áti here because áti[y]átha
would echo the yáthā that ends vs. 14.</p>
<h3 id="viii4617">VIII.46.17</h3>
<p>Another very disturbed verse. My interpretation follows Old in great
degree, but with crucial deviations.
In the first pāda I read, with Gr, Old, and Scar (61), a compound áram-iṣe,
rather than two separate words with Ge (also Pp.; cf. Lub. p. 321 s.v. iṣe), who is
forced to take this as a parenthetical 1st ps. declaration (“ich beeile mich recht”). This
compound qualifies Indra in the dative and matches araṃgamā́ya in b quite nicely.
9
The accent on the verb stávāmahe can be accounted for (in a somewhat ad hoc
fashion) as Old does, as a separate four-syllable pāda, following an eight-syllable
opening.
In de (if this is the correct division), I take gen. pl. viśvámanuṣām with
yajñébhir gīrbhíḥ “through the sacrifices and the hymns of all the peoples of Manu.”
This has the somewhat awkward consequence of separating it from the immediately
following gen. pl. marútām, though if the pāda break follows viśvámanuṣāṃ rather
than gīrbhíḥ as Old takes it, the syntactic separation would be less problematic. (This
would produce a pāda of 10 or 11 syllables [with distraction of -manuṣaām],
followed by one of 8 syllables [also with distraction of gen. pl. -ām].)
Ge takes the subject of iyakṣasi to be the poet addressing himself, while I
think that it is Indra, who is the subject of the same verb in the immediately
preceding hymn (VIII.45.31). The question then is what the object is. Ge supplies the
pronoun “dies,” but the referent of this pronoun isn’t clear to me. I suggest rather
sumnám ‘favor’: the stem íyakṣa- several times takes sumnám as object (I.153.2,
II.20.1. X.50.3), and it appears here in the next verse (18d), where I supply this verb.
If this assumption is correct, we must then ask why Indra would seek to attain the
favor of the Maruts. The key to that is probably the odd snatch of dialogue in the last
hymn (VIII.45.37–38), in which Indra complains that the Maruts deserted him in his
time of need; here he seeks their good will as support in the Vṛtra battle.</p>
<h3 id="viii4618">VIII.46.18</h3>
<p>The referents of the plurals in this verse continue to be the Maruts of the
previous verse, and I think that the same situation obtains: Indra is seeking the
sacrifice and favor of the Maruts. I therefore supply iyakṣasi in this verse, again with
sumnám as object. Thus one half of the VP is found in each verse: iyakṣasi in 17,
sumnám in 18. (Ge also supplies the same verb stem, but in the 1st sg., referring to the
poet.)
The medial transitive-causative pātáyante I take as a reflexive: ‘cause
themselves to fly, launch themselves in flight’.

<h3 id="viii4620">VIII.46.20</h3>
<p>Note the full hemistich of vocatives, all accented because there is no
inherently tonic word to follow.
As Old points out, all the accusatives of the second hemistich should be
grouped with rayím in 19, and the verb of that verse ā́bhara continues to have
domain over this one.</p>

<p>On ṛdhád-rī/i- see Thieme 1958 (Fs. Turner): 157, EWA 118 (s.v.

48.2 “like an obedient mare the chariot pole you should follow riches to fulfillment”
and adopt that interpretation here.
Their tails are presumably straight because they are going so fast their tails
are horizontal.
Ge takes mathrá- as a geographical designation: Mathra horses. But I see no
reason not to connect it with √math ‘churn, agitate’, hence ‘skittish’. See also I.181.5.</p>
<h3 id="viii4624">VIII.46.24</h3>
<p>The final pāda contains a pun on the patron’s name Pṛthuśravas. See
Watkins 1995: 73–74.</p>
<h3 id="viii4625">VIII.46.25</h3>
<p>I take táne and pā́jase as complementary concepts, vertical and
horizontal – our descendants and our synchronic extension.</p>
<h3 id="viii4626">VIII.46.26</h3>
<p>This verse gives the impression of being constructed from random
constituents, although some cohesion can be wrested from it.
Following Old I take b as further specifying the horses in a (áśvebhiḥ), with
the bare numeral saptá substituting for the non-existent instrumental *saptábhiḥ as
elsewhere. It could also specify the number of soma drinks in c (sómebhiḥ), and the
position of the phrase between those two instrumental expressions allows it to be
construed with both. The gen. pl. saptatīnā́m of course simply depends on the
numeral.
In c I supply a form of √mad/mand to be construed with the instr.; so also Ge
(ermuntert).
In d I supply a form such as maṃhase ‘you are ready’, which is common with
dānā́ya, although Ge’s solution, to have the infinitive depend only on the “ermuntert”
is certainly possible and probably neater. See also Scar 313.</p>
<h3 id="viii4627">VIII.46.27</h3>
<p>Another verse with unclear referents and no main clause. I take the
subject to be the god Vāyu, who has inspired the human patron (imám in a) to give
the poet a splendid dakṣiṇā. If Vāyu (deified wind) is the subject, tmánā lit. ‘by his
breath’ is a nice touch.
In c Ge takes araṭvé ákṣe as a PN, and it is certainly tempting. But, although
the second part of that pāda is a PN, interpreting all difficult phrases as names is a
practice to be avoided, and Mayrhofer (EWA s.v. araṭvá-; also PN s.v.) rejects the
name interpretation in favor of “aus dem Holz der araṭu-Baumes” (Wagenachse).
There is no way to be certain.</p>
<h3 id="viii4628">VIII.46.28</h3>
<p>Another virtually impenetrable verse. Rather than discuss my deviations
from others’ interpretations, I will just set out the considerations that produced my
own translation.
I take the referent of the yáḥ in the relative clauses that dominate vss. 26–28
to be Vāyu in all cases. In this verse there’s the embarrassment of the voc. vāyo, but
since there is no verb in 28 nothing prevents it from being couched in the 2nd sg.
11
The utá in b I take as connecting ucathyè vápuṣi and ghr̥tasnā́ḥ, both used of
the svarā́ṭ, despite their different cases.
I think cd represents a new clause, with implied “your”; the prā́jma is rather
like prā́dhvaré in 18, with verb extruded from the prá. The last little bit, idám nú tát,
is a separate clause (like nūnám [áty] átha in 15–16).</p>
<h3 id="viii4629">VIII.46.29</h3>
<p>After the puzzling detour into Vāyu, this verse reunites us with the
dānastuti of vss. 21–24 by means of asanam ‘I won’ in b, found also in 22a.
“Gelding” is supplied on the basis of vs. 20.</p>
<h3 id="viii4631">VIII.46.31</h3>
<p>I supply ā́dade from 32b, though asanam from 29a would also be
possible.</p>
<h2 id="viii47-ādityas">VIII.47 Ādityas</h2>
<h3 id="viii471">VIII.47.1</h3>
<p>Although only Mitra and Varuṇa are mentioned in the first hemistich, vo
mahatā́m is gen. pl. and must refer to all the Ādityas, who are addressed in the next
clause (pāda c).</p>
<h3 id="viii475">VIII.47.5</h3>
<p>The simile is slightly skewed, though, as in English, the case frame with
‘avoid’ works either way. It might be expected that “we” would be compared to the
(presumably) nominative rathyàḥ ‘charioteers’, but grammatically “we” are parallel
to the hard places (durgā́ṇi). Of course technically both durgā́ṇi and rathyàḥ can be
either nom. or acc. pl., so that the skewing could be avoided: “Evils will avoid us, as
hard places avoid charioteers.” But this produces an unintentionally comic picture,
and I follow Ge and Re in the case distribution.</p>
<h3 id="viii476">VIII.47.6</h3>
<p>This verse is contrastively complementary to the preceding one. Both pári
√vṛj and pári √hvṛ mean ‘swerve, turn aside, avoid’, but in vs. 5 pári … vṛṇajan is a
beneficial action, whereas here parihvṛtā́(on accent see Old, Scar 708) refers to
turning aside from the proper course, an action that causes a man to lose out on the
Ādityas’ gift. How substantial this gift can be for someone whom the Ādityas favor
is expressed in cd.</p>
<h3 id="viii479">VIII.47.9</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take revátaḥ with Aryaman, not Mitra. It is true that the adj. is
positioned between the two names and could in principle modify either one or both,
but it belongs to the same pāda as mitrásya, and the following pāda containing
aryamṇáḥ is a repeated pāda (=I.136.2e), in a verse where revánt- is not found. Since,
further, revánt- is not a standard epithet of Aryaman, it seems wise to take it with
Mitra.</p>
<h3 id="viii4710">VIII.47.10</h3>
<p>I have not rendered the four nominal yád clauses, the last three of which
merely introduce further adjectival qualifiers of śárma. The configuration is
12
perilously close to an izafe-type construction, though syntactially nominal clauses are
perfectly workable.</p>
<h3 id="viii4715">VIII.47.15</h3>
<p>The accent on kṛṇávate is somewhat puzzling. Re explains it as a
reflection of the implicit subordination following on vss. 13 and 14, but perhaps
better is the implicit contrast of the vā … vā constuction.</p>
<h2 id="viii48-soma">VIII.48 Soma</h2>
<h3 id="viii481">VIII.48.1</h3>
<p>I take svādóḥ as dependent on váyasaḥ, not qualifying it (contra, e.g., Ge’s
“von dem süssen Krafttrunk”). Note that Soma is called vayodhā́ḥ in the final vs.
(15a) and is therefore not váyaḥ himself.

yo opening pāda b echoes svādór opening a.</p>
<h3 id="viii482">VIII.48.2</h3>
<p>The first pāda is a paradox, in that confinement within leads to
boundlessness. Following Ge et al., I take ca as a subordinator; the accentuation of
prā́gā(ḥ) is ambiguous: the Pp. reads prá agāḥ, but pra-ágāḥ is equally possible (so
Old).
How to resolve the sandhi in śraúṣṭīva is discussed by Old at some length;
with him I take it as a fem. nom. sg. śraúṣṭī. The Pp. analyzes rāyá as rāyé, but rāyáḥ
is also possible, either as gen. sg. or acc. pl. I take it as the latter. My tr. of this pāda
is closest to Re’s.</p>
<h3 id="viii484">VIII.48.4</h3>
<p>Note the faint echo pītá … pité(va).</p>
<h3 id="viii485">VIII.48.5</h3>
<p>On anāha see Kü’s length and useful disc. (289). Flg. Old (accepted by
Kü), I take it as a 3rd sg., not 2nd pl. with Ge, Re. The nom. pl. imé … pītā́yaśása
uruṣyávaḥ of pāda a is (silently) resumed by sg. “soma.” In order to demonstrate the
change in number of the subject, my tr. appears to treat pāda a as a separate clause,
which of course it is not. Among other things, the mā in Wackernagel’s Position in a
is the obj. of sám anāha in b.
Like 2a this hemistich is a paradox: the soma drops “seeking wide space”
nonetheless tie the drinker together.</p>
<h3 id="viii486">VIII.48.6</h3>
<p>didīpaḥ must be a redupl. aor. corresponding to trans.-caus. dīpáyati,
despite the light redupl. We expect *dīdīpaḥ or even *dīdipaḥ (which is found in B.E.
acdg. to Whitney’s Rts).
Pāda-final naḥ serves as object to both verbs in b.
All standard treatments take prá carā as 2nd sg. impv., but I think it works
better as 1st sg. subjunctive. See also IX.82.4.</p>
<h3 id="viii489">VIII.48.9</h3>
<p>Because of its accent niṣasátthā(ḥ) must still be under the domain of hí in
pāda a, contra Ge, who takes a as a nominal clause and b as independent.

<h3 id="viii4810">VIII.48.10</h3>
<p>The voc. haryaśva (always elsewhere of Indra) is presumably addressed

referring to soma&rsquo;s color.</p>
<h3 id="viii4811">VIII.48.11</h3>
<p>ánirā- is lit. ‘want of nourishment’. Since írā- sometimes seems
specialized for liquid nourishment, I considered ‘thirsts’ here, and indeed in
VIII.60.20, conjoined with kṣúdham ‘hunger’, ‘thirst’ works well. But in this passage
such a translation sounds as if it refers to desires or cravings, and I think the passage
refers to external threats rather than those generated within the person.</p>

<p>On vivákṣaṇa- see VIII.45.11.
Ge takes pāda d as a separate clause and supplies a verb, while taking kṣudrā́
as “small animals”: “auf dass du … leibhaftig wie kleine Tiere (?) brav ver(mehrest)”
– an interpretation that seems to me both unnecessary and bizarre. The other RVic
example of kṣudrá- (I.129.6), which he claims also to refer to a small animal, I take
to mean ‘speck’. It seems more sensible to take d as belonging with c, with the simile
kṣudréva serving as object to kirā́si. The only evidence I can see against this is that
√kṛ ‘scatter’ doesn&rsquo;t otherwise appear with prá in the RV, but that lexeme is common
later. I take kṣudrá- here to refer to small particles of dust; see IV.38.7 kirate reṇúm.</p>
<h3 id="viii495">VIII.49.5</h3>
<p>Phonological figure svadhāvan svadáyanti.</p>
<h3 id="viii496">VIII.49.6</h3>
<p>The simile marking in pāda a seems unnecessary: why is Indra like a
powerful hero, rather than, as usual, simply being one. Perhaps the tendency for
many verses and half-verses in this hymn to begin with similes enforced that pattern
here.
In c the double marking of the simile (udrī́va … avató ná siñcaté) also seems
to serve no purpose.
kṣáranti … dhītáyaḥ is very close to kṣáranti dhītáyaḥ in the matching hymn
VIII.50.4.
14</p>
<h3 id="viii497">VIII.49.7</h3>
<p>The reason for the three yád’s in ab isn’t clear. It may be that the
duplications and unnecessary markings noted in this verse and the preceding one are
signs of apprentice compositions.</p>
<h3 id="viii498">VIII.49.8</h3>
<p>Ge interprets the first relative clause as only consisting of yé te “die du
hast,” but all things being equal, I try to avoid interpretations that require embedded
relative clauses (though see the pseudo-izafe in 3b above), and in this case a relative
clause that extends to the end of b is perfectly possible. That 50.8 has the same
structure is an additional support for this interpretation.
The corresponding verse in the twinned hymn, VIII.50.8d, contains yébhiḥ
svàḥ parī́yase. I therefore think that parī́yase in our c also has domain over d, also
containing svàḥ. Ge, by contrast, supplies kṛṇóṣi, to produce a periphrastic causative
“mit denen du die ganze Welt die Sonne schauen (lässest).”</p>
<h3 id="viii499">VIII.49.9</h3>
<p>Ge takes gómataḥ with te, not sumnásya as I do. This is possible but not
necessary, especially since the adjective isn’t exclusively, or even generally, used of
beings, and since neuter gómat is found in the following verse (probably modifying
an unexpressed word for spoils or the like, though I suppose neut. sumnám might be
possible).</p>
<h2 id="viii50-indra">VIII.50 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii501">VIII.50.1</h3>
<p>This verse is very close to 49.1 in structure and lexicon. Some items are
identical and positioned identically: a: surā́dhasam, c: yáh, (-)vasu, d: sahásreṇeva.
Others are identical words but placed differently: ab: (abhí) prá &hellip; arca. Then there
are synonyms with the same function: c: jaritṛ́bhyaḥ / suvaté stuvaté. Root
connections deployed differently: 49d śíkṣati / 50b śakrám; 49c maghávā 50d
máṃhate. The only items that don&rsquo;t have any correspondents in the other hymn are
49a abhí, vaḥ; b: índram &hellip; yáthā vidé; c: purū- / 50a sú śrutám; b: abhíṣtaye; c:
kā́myam.</p>
<h3 id="viii502">VIII.50.2</h3>
<p>The two versions of this verse deviate slightly more than those of vs. 1:
identical and identically positioned: a: śatānīkā (though difference in number
concealed by sandhi), a/c: asya; more or less identical, but with inflectional
difference: c: giréḥ / girír, pinvire / pinvate; root connections: 49d -bhójasah / 50c
bhujmā́. Otherwise the verses are distinct, but notice that 50a śatā́nīkā hetáyaḥ allows
the noun with śatā́nīkā in 49a to be supplied.</p>
<h3 id="viii503">VIII.50.3</h3>
<p>This verse deviates from its correspondent even more than the last.
Identical are sutā́sa índavo (a) and ā́po ná (c); root identity: 49b mádā yé / 50ab yád &hellip;
ámandiṣuḥ. In addition the simile in 49.3, where waters fill a pond, allows the
underdetermined simile in 50.3 to be interpreted: it seems more likely that the
pressing has been deposited in Indra than that it has been set out for him. Ge follows
the latter interpretation and is forced to supply a recipient in the simile that has no
15
textual support: “… dargebracht wie Wasser (dem Durstigen).” See Ge’s n., which
argues for his interpretation and explicitly for a different sense in the simile from that
in 49.3.</p>
<h3 id="viii504">VIII.50.4</h3>
<p>The two verses differ from each other almost entirely, except that the
openings of the first two pādas are identical: anehásam (a), mádhvaḥ (b). Still,
reference to 49.4 aids in the interpretation of this verse: in 49.4 the referent of
anehásam is clearly soma; here that is less immediately clear, but surely correct.
See Old for considerable discussion of this verse, though without reaching
firm conclusions.</p>
<h3 id="viii505">VIII.50.5</h3>
<p>Yet another type of variation, whereby the poet plays on distinct but
phonologically or semantically similar words. In 49a ā́na stómam / 50a ā́naḥ sóme
the common play on sóma- and stóma- is found. In 49b (d)hyānó áśvo ná / 50b iyānó
&lsquo;tyo ná the phrases are identical in sense and in morphology (medial athematic
participle, a-stem nom. sg.) but use two different lexical realizations for both. In 49c
yáṃ te svadhāvan svadáyanti / 50c yáṃ te svadāvan svádanti the clauses are
identically constructed, the verbs are identical and have identical meanings, though
one is a Class I stem, the other an -áya-transitive, and the vocatives are lexically
distinct, though rhyming and identically formed. Finally, both d pādas contain a
locative indicating the person(s) at whose sacrifice Indra is.</p>
<h3 id="viii506">VIII.50.6</h3>
<p>The two versions are closer together than the last few verses: 49a ugráṃ
ná vīrám / 50a prá vīrám ugrám / b: víbhūtim / c: udrī́va vajrinn avató. In addition
49b has -vasum and 50c vasutvanā́, and 49d is almost identical to 50.4b.
I supply árcā on the basis of prá and vs. 1, but any verb of praising or the like
will do.</p>
<h3 id="viii507">VIII.50.7</h3>
<p>The somewhat awkward tripling of yád in 49.7 is avoided here with a
simple yád … yád vā, but the two versions still echo each other exactly: yád dha
nūnám … (a) / yád vā prthivy ̥ ā́m … (b), as also in c mahemata. The d pādas are
identically structured, but lexically distinct: nom. sg. + instr. pl. (to same stem) ā́
gahi.</p>
<h3 id="viii508">VIII.50.8</h3>
<p>The versions pattern closely together despite variant semantics: (aj)irā́so /
(rath)irā́so hárayo yé te … (a); vā́tā… /&hellip;vā́tasya … (b); yébhir &hellip; mánuṣaḥ (c);
yébhiḥ (&hellip;) svàr … (d).
The poor transmission of the Vālakhilya is probably responsible for the faulty
accent of nighóṣayaḥ (for *nighoṣáyaḥ)(so Old). There is also unnecessary doubling
of the preverb ní (which does not affect the meter, however).</p>
<h3 id="viii509">VIII.50.9</h3>
<p>Read, with Gr and Old, *ávaso (that is, te ‘vaso), which also repairs the
meter.
16
The corresponding verses are structured identically, with etā́vataḥ opening the
first hemistich and its rhetorical partner yáthā opening the two pādas of the second
hemistich. In each verse we seek the same thing for ourselves that Indra provided to
two clients, named in the second hemistich. There is also some matching
phraseology: etā́vatas te (a), yáthā prā́vo (c), yáthā (d), as well as dháne in 49d and
50c.</p>
<h3 id="viii5010">VIII.50.10</h3>
<p>Again the two versions are almost entirely parallel, with named examples
of the beneficiaries of Indra’s bounty given in yáthā clauses, including some with
very close similarities in wording: yáthā káṇve maghavan LOC LOC&hellip; (a) / yáthā
góśarye √SAN … (C) / d: gómad dhíraṇya- (49d) / gotrám hari- (50d).
I differ from Ge in my interpretation of pāda b. He takes dīrghánīthe
dámūnasi as another PN (so also Mayrhofer, PN, for the first but not the second), and
I admit that parallelism with 49b, which contains a PN, is in his favor. However, here
there is no yáthā marking the pāda as a different segment, and furthermore dámūnas-
‘domestic leader, master of the house’ is never otherwise used of mortals, but almost
always characterizes Agni. Since dīrghánīti- is perfectly understandable in its literal
meaning, I take this pāda as referring to Agni and as parallel to the locatives in pāda
a indicating the sacrifice.</p>
<h2 id="viii51-indra">VIII.51 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii511">VIII.51.1</h3>
<p>As indicated in the intro., this verse replicates the structure of the final
verses (10) of VIII.49 and 50.</p>
<h3 id="viii512-1">VIII.51.2</h3>
<p>It is difficult to understand what is going on in the first hemistich, which is
filled with words apparently referring to positions of the body: sám asādayat ‘made
to sit up’, śáyānam ‘lying down’, úddhitam ‘set upright’. I have tr. all of these
literally. Ge. takes the first lexeme figuratively, with sám asādayat meaning ‘invited
to a sattra (sacrifical session)’. I consider this to be a secondary sense in this verse,
but because of the body-position language, I think something more literal is meant,
quite possibly a revival or healing of Praskaṇva by ritual means. But without further
context, it remains unclear.
Ge and Old suggest that Dasyave Vṛka is the same person as Pārṣadvāṇa and
the sacrificial patron of Praskaṇva. (Dasyave Vṛka is celebrated in dānastutis in</p>
<h3 id="viii551">VIII.55.1</h3>
<p>and 56.1.) This seems reasonable but unprovable. In that case Praskaṇva is
probably the ṛṣi of pāda c.</p>
<h3 id="viii513-1">VIII.51.3</h3>
<p>With Ge I read aviṣyántam, not áriṣyantam. See his n. on 3d. Old rejects
the emendation, but since the áviṣyantam is found in the Khila collection and in “die
gute ind. Ausgabe des Pp.,” I think the reading is justifiable, esp. given the poor
transmission of the Vālakhilya. The publ. tr. should have an asterisk before “a man
greedy for food.”
17</p>
<h3 id="viii514-1">VIII.51.4</h3>
<p>Although the first hemistich clearly describes ritual activity, its exact
reference is unclear. Ge plausibly suggests that the chant is “seven-headed”
(saptáśīrṣānam) because it issues from the mouths of seven priests. “Threefold”
could refer to the three pressings of the soma sacrifice or perhaps the three fires, but
neither of these interpretations imposes itself. As for the “highest footstep,” see
discussion at I.21.6 and I.22.21. The highest footstep is usually Viṣṇu’s, and Viṣṇu
does stride his three steps in the immediately following (and twinned) hymn,
VIII.52.3. As elsewhere, the “highest footstep” seems to be the celestial counterpart
of the ritual ground on earth, and the same types of ritual activities are performed
there as on earth.
Ge suggests that the referent of sá in c is the chant, not Indra, but the yásmai
… sá construction virtually demands that the referent of sá be the same as that of
yásmai, which cannot be the arká-. Indra is the most likely referent of both (though
Viṣṇu might be barely possible). Note that no god’s name appears in the verse,
leaving the reference apparently deliberately undefined. However, paúṃsya- in d is
almost always a characteristic of Indra’s, and both the preceding and following
verses (3, 5) open with definitional relative clauses, like that of 4ab, where the
relative pronoun is explicitly identified as Indra in the main clause (3c, 5b índraṃ
tám), which imposes the same identification here.</p>
<h3 id="viii516">VIII.51.6</h3>
<p>After the three verses whose yá- … sá/tám constructions refer to Indra, the
same construction now identifies Indra’s client.</p>
<h3 id="viii517">VIII.51.7</h3>
<p>Notice the over-the-top piling up of particles and similar items in c: úpaupa íd nú &hellip; bhū́ya íd nú, with the actual topic postponed till the next pāda.
The lexeme úpa √pṛc generally has a sexual connotation (see disc. I.40.6),
and given the barren cow and the going dry of ab, ‘becomes engorged’ better
captures the contrast than Ge’s anodyne “nimmt … zu und zu” (increases).</p>
<h3 id="viii518">VIII.51.8</h3>
<p>The final pāda is identical to 4d, save for the final word, which serves as
subject. The identity of pā́rthivaḥ here isn’t certain. It cannot be Indra, who is the
subject of the preceding clauses and whose action in c grounds and precedes the birth
of the ‘earth-dweller’ in d. The idea may be that Indra’s cosmogonic actions in c
allow the creation of the humans on earth, which has just been separated from heaven.
This interpretation is supported by the following verse.</p>
<h3 id="viii519-1">VIII.51.9</h3>
<p>A syntactically problematic verse, which has produced multiple
interpretations, not all of which can be treated here. It is further complicated by the
fact that three different related stems to the highly charged arí- word are found in it:
ā́rya- (a), arí- (b), and aryá- (c).
I take ab as an independent nominal possessive clause, with Indra the referent
of yásya. The clause follows nicely on 8d: since Indra’s cosmogonic deeds led
directly to the birth of the earth-dwelling people, it is said in 9ab that all of them,
Ārya and Dāsa alike, belong to him.
18
The expression tiráś cid aryé in c resembles a number of passages containing
tiráś cid aryá-, including several in VIII: 33.14 tiráś cid aryám sávanāni &hellip; and 66.12
tiráś cid aryáḥ sávanā. In such passages Indra is urged to pass over the pressings
(and so forth) associated with the stranger and come to our sacrifice. I believe that
the same thing is being urged here. This requires supplying a verb of motion and
also assuming a word haplology of some sort, such as *(aryám/aryáḥ) aryé (so also
Ge, though we differ on much of the rest of the interpretation).
Unlike all other interpretations known to me (including Thieme Fremdling
70–71 and two alternatives given by Scar, p. 308), I take d as a separate clause
because tubhyét só seems very much a clause-initial sequence. Note that verse-final
rayíḥ echoes the last word of b, aríḥ.</p>
<h3 id="viii5110">VIII.51.10</h3>
<p>arkám ānṛcuḥ matches the same expression in 4a, where it had
cosmogonic implications. Presumably the association adds luster to the more
mundane efforts of the current poets.</p>
<h2 id="viii52-indra">VIII.52 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii521-1">VIII.52.1</h3>
<p>This verse is almost identical to 51.1 in its first half, save for Manu’s
patronymic; the structure of the second halves is very similar, with locatives
expressing the various sacrificers, past and present, where Indra has enjoyed or will
enjoy the sacrifice.</p>
<h3 id="viii522-1">VIII.52.2</h3>
<p>The pattern of the first verse is continued here.</p>
<h3 id="viii523-1">VIII.52.3</h3>
<p>A series of relative clauses without a main clause. It cannot be connected
with the next verse because the relative pronoun has a different referent there.</p>
<h3 id="viii524-1">VIII.52.4</h3>
<p>This verse is structurally a mess. It seems at first to have made the same
shift of the referent of the relative pronoun from Indra (vs. 3) to Indra’s client (vs. 4)
as was made in the preceding hymn in vs. 6: yásya stómeṣu “in whose praises” refers
to the praiser. But the resumptive pronoun tám refers not to the praiser but to Indra,
as the phrase táṃ tvā makes explicit, and the single praiser of 4a, implicitly in the 3rd
person (though see Scar 225, who supplies “Zu mir”), corresponds to the 1st pl.
vayám in c.
Ge (followed by Scar 225) takes vā́je as part of the voc. phrase in b: “du im
Kampf Sieghafter, Ratreicher.” This is possible, I suppose, and even favored by the
pāda boundary, but I take it as one of those locative absolutes without expressed
participle, like common dháne “when the stake (is set).”</p>
<h3 id="viii525">VIII.52.5</h3>
<p>On īśānakṛ́t see I.61.11. Here the point is that Indra does what masters are
supposed to do: give.
19
In c áyāman is universally taken (as far as I know) as ‘not on a journey’, but it
makes much more sense as a derivative of √yā ‘beg’, indicating that even without
prompting Indra should do the right thing by us.</p>
<h3 id="viii526">VIII.52.6</h3>
<p>Although this hymn does not at all correspond to its predecessor (VIII.51)
to the same degree as VIII.49 and 50, this verse shows real responsion to 51.6:
yásmai tváṃ vaso dānā́ya [2ND SG. VERB] (a) / sá rāyás póṣam [3RD SG. VERB] (b) / …
havāmahe (d).</p>
<h3 id="viii527">VIII.52.7</h3>
<p>Though the verse starts like its counterpart, 51.7, with kadā́caná [2ND SG.],
the verses go off in different directions.
The elements in the second hemistich can be variously distributed. Like most
interpretors I take hávanam as the mortals’ call to the gods and the subject of ā́
tasthau, but I take indriyám as modifying it, meaning (unusually for this stem)
‘destined for / appropriate to Indra’ (so, approximately, Old), while Ge instead
makes it the goal and supplies “name”: “… bis zu deinem indrischen unsterblichen
(Namen) im Himmel…” This is not impossible, but I do not understand why our
invocation would go to Indra’s name. I supply bhúvanam or similar with amṛ́tam.
The vocative “fourth Āditya” (túrīyāditya) is somewhat surprising, but as Old
suggests it must identify Indra as fourth, after the standard trio Mitra, Varuṇa, and
Aryaman. Why Indra is called an Āditya in this particular context is not clear to me.</p>
<h3 id="viii528-1">VIII.52.8</h3>
<p>Another “improper” relative in ab, where the pious man who is the
referent of yásmai is then implicitly identified with the emphatic fronted “us”
(asmā́kam) in cd.</p>
<h3 id="viii529-1">VIII.52.9</h3>
<p>The verse deploys a number of words for verbal offerings: mánma (a),
bráhma (b), and medhā́ḥ (d). In c a feminine term needs to be supplied in the phrase
pūrvī́r ṛtásya bṛhatī́ḥ “the many lofty ___ of truth.” I have supplied gíraḥ ‘songs’
from vs. 8, as it also shows up with pūrvī́ḥ elsewhere (VI.34.1, VIII.96.10, IX.85.11,
X.29.5) &ndash; though oddly when we get pūrvī́ḥ &hellip; br̥hatī́ḥ, it&rsquo;s with íṣaḥ ‘refreshments’
(VI.1.2, IX.87.9), which wouldn’t fit here because it is not a verbal product. But note
gíro bṛhatī́ḥ with the same verb in III.51.1 índraṃ gíro br̥hatī́r abhy ànūṣata. Ge
supplies ‘words’, which would also work semantically, though he doesn’t specify
which feminine noun he thinks it is (vā́caḥ perhaps?).</p>
<h3 id="viii5210">VIII.52.10</h3>
<p>I don’t really understand the idiom sám √dhū ‘shake together’. Its intent
seems to be ‘produce, create’, but the semantic mechanism is unclear to me. It’s
possible that sám occurs with √dhū here only because of the sám in the second
hemistich. A straight ‘shake out’ or ‘shake loose’ could more easily develop to
‘produce, create’. Though cf. sám √dhū in I.10.8 (where I do tr. ‘shake loose’).
In pāda a rā́yo bṛhatī́ḥ seems to require rayí- to be fem., as occasionally
elsewhere (but not so often as generally thought). I wonder, however, if the bṛhatī́ḥ
has been borrowed from 9c: pūrvī́r ṛtásya bṛhatī́r anūṣata, which is structured in
20
parallel to 10a sám índro rā́yo bṛhatī́r adhūnuta. It is even possible that bṛhatī́ḥ in
10a doesn’t modify rā́yaḥ but refers to the same object as found in 9c (“lofty songs”
vel sim.). This might solve the just-discussed problem of sám √dhū: perhaps there
are two objects of “shake together” &ndash; something like “shook together riches and lofty
(songs).”</p>
<h2 id="viii53-indra">VIII.53 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii531">VIII.53.1</h3>
<p>On rāyáḥ see VIII.46.6.</p>
<h3 id="viii533-1">VIII.53.3</h3>
<p>Ge takes víśveṣāṃ as referring to the soma drops (“… den Saft des Honigs
all der Somasäfte”), and this interpretation has the advantage of providing a plural
referent in the main clause for plural yé … índavaḥ in the relative clause.
Nonetheless, I take it instead as qualifying naḥ ‘us’, to indicate the totality of the
Ārya sacrificial community, near and far, as described in cd (and also 4cd). As
indicated in comments on the previous Vālakhilya hymns, improper relatives abound,
with mismatch between number and person, and so the lack of a plural referent for yé
… índavaḥ would not be problematic. However, Ge’s interpretation is certainly
possible.</p>
<h3 id="viii534-1">VIII.53.4</h3>
<p>The “all” of b is undefined. I tentatively think it refers to us (that is, the
entire Ārya community), but Old suggests it is the soma drops of 3cd. Ge doesn’t
specify in the tr., but refers to the víśveṣām of 3 in his n.
I know nothing about the Śīṣṭas.</p>
<h3 id="viii535">VIII.53.5</h3>
<p>Ge tr. mitámedha- as “die die Gedanken aufrichten,” but I do not see how
a transitive reading of mitá- would work in a compound so constructed.</p>
<h3 id="viii536-1">VIII.53.6</h3>
<p>I supply “lifetimes” (ā́yūṃṣi) in c, because ā́yus- is the standard object of
prá √tṛ. Ge assumes that the object is the referent of the following relative clause (yé
ta ukthínaḥ … (“Fördere fein … die, welche als deiner Lobsänger…”). This is
possible, but ignores the usual idiom.
What it means to “purify (Indra’s) resolve” isn’t clear to me, but the phrase
occurs elsewhere (cf. VIII.12.11, 13.1). In any case the father of the patron Dasyave
Vṛka is Pūtakratu (see VIII.56.2, also 4), so this is a pun.</p>
<h3 id="viii537">VIII.53.7</h3>
<p>If read with what follows, the relative clause in pāda a is even more
irregular than those we have already met in the Vālakhilya. However, there is a
simple solution. The identical pāda occurs as V.35.1a, where it clearly modifies
krátuḥ in b: yás te sā́dhiṣṭhó ‘vasa, índra krátuṣ ṭám ā́bhara “Your resolve to help
that best brings success, Indra, bring that here.” Since krátum is found in the last
pāda of the preceding verse, 6d, I take the relative clause of 7a as dependent on the
krátum in 6d. Unfortunately this straddles a pragātha boundary, but I find it hard to
believe that the krátu association played no role in the repetition of this pāda. It is
21
even possible that the somewhat odd bháreṣu in 7b was influenced by bhara in
V.35.1b (though see 8d).</p>
<h3 id="viii538-1">VIII.53.8</h3>
<p>Ge takes ājíṃ √yā as a phrasal verb (“mache ich … einen Wettlauf”) that
can take an accusative (“einen Wettlauf um…”). I do not see any other way to
construe bráhma, though I am a bit dubious about the construction.
The opening of c, tvā́m íd evá tám is an inflated version, with tonic 2nd ps.
pronoun, of tám tvā, which is found several times in this group of hymns (our 2c;
also 51.6c, 52.4c). This inflation seems to have driven the preverb sám into postverbal position (áme sám).
Old and Ge accept the Kashmir reading *matīnā́m, but Narten (1960: 132 n.
34 = KlSch 22 n. 34) makes a convincing case that the transmitted mathīnā́m is
correct and means ‘robbings/plunderings’. This works well with vājayúḥ, aśvayúḥ,
and gavyúḥ in this verse, as well as bháreṣu in 7b.</p>
<h2 id="viii54-indra">VIII.54 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii541">VIII.54.1</h3>
<p>As Old points out, the accent on gṛṇánti is unnecessary. It may have been
borrowed, with the pāda, from VIII.46.3, where the accent is correct because the
pāda is part of a relative clause.</p>
<h3 id="viii542">VIII.54.2</h3>
<p>índram in pāda a, apparently 3rd ps., is co-referential with the 2nd sg.
subject of mándase in the relative clause of b, but this kind of slippage is common.</p>
<h3 id="viii544">VIII.54.4</h3>
<p>In pāda a it would also be possible to supply ‘hear’ from 3d (governing
hávanam, as it did hávam in 3d), with ávantu the verb only of b.</p>
<h3 id="viii546">VIII.54.6</h3>
<p>I take pāda a as a nominal clause, with b separate, in order to account for
the unaccented verb in b following hí in a. This requires taking ā́jipate nṛpate as
predicated vocatives, a rare but still attested construction; see, e.g., I.15.2. This
should also require naḥ at the end of pāda a to be construed with that clause, which
the publ. tr. does not do. I would now add “for us” after “lord of men” and in the
second clause make “us” parenthetical. Ge takes ab as a single sentence, which
avoids the predicated vocative but has an unaccented verb in a hí clause. Old
mentions the problem but decides that the lack of accent can be attributed to faulty
transmission of the Vālakhilya. This is of course possible.
Both Old and Ge accept the Kashmir ā́bhakṣi for ā́vakṣi, though Old admits
that the latter also works. I do not see the need to change the text.
Although VIII.54 has little in common with VIII.53, note 6cd … hótrābhir utá
devávītibhiḥ, sasavā́ṃso … and 53.7c … hótrābhir utá deváhūtibhiḥ, sasavā́ṃso …</p>
<h3 id="viii547">VIII.54.7</h3>
<p>With Old, Ge, Thieme (Fremd. 26), I read aryáḥ against Pp. aryé.
In b índra can stand for either índraḥ or índre. Either will work; I have chosen
(with Ge) the locative, but see Thieme’s “Indra ist das Leben der Leute.”
22</p>
<h2 id="viii55-dānastuti">VIII.55 Dānastuti</h2>
<h3 id="viii553">VIII.55.3</h3>
<p>Though this vs. continues the list of gifts begun in vs. 2, it is entirely in the
accusative, while vs. 2 is in the nominative. There is no verb governing vs. 3, and I
simply tr. as part of the list.
In the publ. tr. “ewes” should be in parens.
Ge. tr. áruṣīṇāṃ cátuḥśatam as “hundertundvier rötliche (Schafe)” (my italics),
which makes one wonder about his barnyard experience. Wikipedia tells me that
there does exist something called the Armenian red sheep (or Armenian mouflon,
etc.), native to Iran and Armenia. But since the gifts celebrated in dānastutis are
domestic animals, this information doesn’t seem helpful. There is also something
called the California red sheep, but this hybrid was only developed in the 1970s and
half a world away from Dasyave Vṛka. On the other hand, “black” sheep are often
more brownish than black and in certain lights could appear reddish. There is also a
(recent?) breed of Indian sheep known as Bannur or Mandya, some of which appear
(on Google Images) reddish.</p>
<h3 id="viii555">VIII.55.5</h3>
<p>Ge takes sāptá- as “der treuen Freundschaft,” presumably as a derivative
of sápti- ‘team’ (see his sim. derivation in VIII.41.4 and my comm. thereon). But it
does not make sense to deny a numerical value for sāptá- here, since it is found in
clearly numerical sense in nearby VIII.59.5 (Vālakh.) tríbhiḥ sāptébhiḥ.</p>
<h2 id="viii56-dānastuti">VIII.56 Dānastuti</h2>
<h3 id="viii564">VIII.56.4</h3>
<p>Old and Ge opt for the Kashmir Khila reading, nom. sg. pūtákratāyī, but it
hardly makes sense that Dasyava Vṛka would be giving away his mother. It makes
better sense to take the Saṃhitā reading pūtákratāyai (for *pūtákratāyyai), dat. (for
gen.), “(the female one) of Pūtakratāyī,” namely her daughter and Dasyava Vṛka’s
sister, who would be a more likely gift-in-marriage.
yūthyā̀m is probably a faulty reading. The Khila has yūthyàm, but Ge’s
suggestion, yūthyā̀, seems plausible.</p>
<h3 id="viii565">VIII.56.5</h3>
<p>I suggest reading *bṛhát-sūro here, that is, a bahuvrīhi meaning
‘possessing a lofty sun’. The point is the usual one, that Agni is another form of the
sun, and his flame as it rises is like the sun. The publ. tr. should have an asterisk
before “having his own sun aloft.”</p>
<h2 id="viii57-aśvins">VIII.57 Aśvins</h2>
<h3 id="viii571">VIII.57.1</h3>
<p>Ge and Old both suggest reading *yuktvā́for yuktā́, and Ge further
suggests ráthe ná for ráthena. Although such emendations are legitimate in the
poorly transmitted Vālakhilya, I see no reason to change the text if we can make it
make sense as it stands.
23</p>
<h3 id="viii572">VIII.57.2</h3>
<p>Once again Old, Ge, and Re are in favor of various emendations (for
which see the relevant discussions), but it is possible to make sense of the text, with
the only alteration from assuming that dadṛśe stands for a dissimilated *dadṛśre.</p>
<h3 id="viii573">VIII.57.3</h3>
<p>I do not know who the bull (vṛṣabháḥ) is; Old suggests Indra, Ge Agni.</p>
<h2 id="viii58-fragment">VIII.58 Fragment</h2>
<h3 id="viii581">VIII.58.1</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., this verse probably treats the Tānūnaptra.
Although Ge suggests that the yám and yáḥ simply show the free use of the relative
pronoun for general subordination, tr. both as ‘wenn’, I think tátra in d is the
correlative of both: the Sacrificer has a compact with both the sacrifice itself (ab) and
the priest who carries it out (c).
As Old points out, āsīt should no doubt be read as accented ā́sīt; the sketchy
transmission of the hymn no doubt accounts for these errors.</p>
<h3 id="viii583">VIII.58.3</h3>
<p>As Old points out, adhijajñe should be accented (-jajñé) and huve should
not be.
VIII.59 Indra and Varuṇa</p>
<h3 id="viii591">VIII.59.1</h3>
<p>I do not think it nec., with Ge, to supply a new verb with prá in b, since
√sṛ regularly appears with prá.
I supply rā́dhase with mahé. This phrase is frequent, esp. in VIII (I.139.6,
III.41.6, VIII.2.29, 24.10, 45.24, etc.), and rā́dhas- is a favorite word in the Vāl.</p>
<h3 id="viii592">VIII.59.2</h3>
<p>The Khila ābhyām should be read for āstām.
pāré can be read with both genitives, rájasaḥ and ádhvanaḥ, separately (so
also Ge) and is positioned between them.
Despite the morphological peculiarity of sísratuḥ (on which see Old, Narten
[see Kü’s ref.], Kü 553), I see no reason to substitute the Khila tasthátuḥ with Old,
Ge. Both Narten and Kü endorse the nonce form sísratuḥ.</p>

<h2 id="end-of-vālakhilya">The three gifts in ab seems to show a developmental sequence: they first

makes things considerably easier.

<p>Most take yákṣ
i
yaḥ as a deriv. of √yakṣ ‘appear, display’, yákṣa-
‘apparition’, hence Ge’s ‘wunderbar’. I am taken instead by Old’s suggestion
(considered also by Re) that it incorporates the si-impv. yakṣi ‘sacrifice!’ regularly
addressed to Agni, and my tr. reflects this. At the very least it is likely to play on
√yaj, given its proximity to yájiṣṭha- (1d, 3c) and yajñéṣu (2d).</p>
<h3 id="viii604">VIII.60.4</h3>
<p>I take ádrogham adverbially with Gr and (apparently) Re, while Ge
supplies an acc. of the 1st sg. pronoun to serve as goal for ā́vaha: “(Zu mir), der ohne
Falsch ist, fahre …” The accent, against adj. adroghá-, may support an adverbial
interpr.
hitáḥ is ambiguous: it can belong either to √dhā ‘place’ (see súdhitā in c) or
√hi ‘impel’, and both may be meant. It also plays off immediately preceding
dhītíbhiḥ, though it cannot belong to √dhī.</p>
<h3 id="viii605">VIII.60.5</h3>
<p>ṛtáḥ here is one of only two masc. forms of this extraordinarily common
neut. stem, the other of which also qualifies kavíḥ (IX.62.30). (Gr’s three masc. acc.
ṛtám are actually neut., and the apparent du. masc. ṛtā́appears in X.106, a hymn
constructed of gibberish, in vs. 5, which I refused to tr.) In these two passages it must
be a secondarily adjectivized application of ṛtá- ‘truth’, facilitated by its past
participle shape (and origin). Hence the special-effect tr. ‘entruthed’. Its appearance
here may also be motivated in part by the semi-palindromic trātar rtás ̥ . The form ṛtás
is unusual also because of its irregular sandhi with following kavíḥ, on which see
comm. ad VII.18.2. Curiously the other example of this phrase in IX.62.30 shows the
standard sandhi ṛtáḥ kavíḥ.
The trio kaví-, vedhás-, and vípra- recurs from vs. 3. There Agni was both
kaví- and vedhás- attended to by vípras; here his attendants are vípras and vedháses,
while he remains a kaví-.</p>

<p>On the metrical shape of dīdihi see comm. ad IX.108.9.</p>
<h3 id="viii609">VIII.60.9</h3>
<p>I am a little uncertain why/how Agni protects us with hymn(s) (gír-),
which are what we usually offer to him. Ge and Re soften the expression by tr.
‘word(s)’, but that is not what gír- means. Perhaps Agni’s “hymns” are the crackling
noises of the fire, or else the instrumentals express cause: “protect us by reason of
(our) hymns.” I prefer the former of these solutions. (See 18a below.) The various
instrumentals cannot directly take up the pāyúbhiḥ of 8d, because pāyú- is masc. and
all four number instrumentals (ékayā, etc.) are unambiguously feminine, as is gírwhen it finally shows up in c.</p>
<h3 id="viii6011">VIII.60.11</h3>
<p>A verb like ‘bring’ needs to be supplied with the first hemistich based on
the numerous passages containing ā́bhara governing no rayím (e.g., I.79.8 ā́no agne
rayím bhara); cf. also 18cd below.
25
On upamāte see VIII.40.9.
The publ. tr. “very glorious” is a careless error for “self-glorious,” misreading
sváyaśastaram as *súyaśastaram. I am evidently not alone in this, as the SV reads
this instead. If this were the correct reading the accent should probably have been
*suyáśastaram, given forms like suśrávas(-tama)-.</p>
<h3 id="viii6012">VIII.60.12</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take vardha as intransitive/reflexive “wachse du,” “renforce
toi,” but active forms of várdha- are about as reliably transitive as Vedic verbs get.</p>
<h3 id="viii6016">VIII.60.16</h3>
<p>The sense of sutyájam is disputed. I ascribe to it the same metaphorical
meaning as ‘abandon’ acquires in English, namely acting without constraint. This fits
nicely with áhrayas- ‘unabashed, immoderate, unrestrained’. A fire blazing up out of
control is presumably meant; in the next pāda it manages to split a rock &ndash; a sudden
glancing allusion to the Vala myth, in which Agni usually has no role.</p>
<h3 id="viii6018">VIII.60.18</h3>
<p>In a hymn of rare clarity, this verse provides a sudden stumbling block.
Re’s comment, “Galamatias [gibberish] en dānastuti,” does not provoke optimism.
My interpr. is very far from the standard ones. The problems arise from the
grammatical and semantic interpr. of suṣāmáṇi and of the hapax cikitvánā and the
construal of sacate and of túbhyam.
The differently accented suṣā́man- is a PN, and both Ge and Re take suṣāmáni
as such here (so also Mayr. PN) &ndash; Ge as a nom. (“eine der rätselhaften
Nominativeformen auf i”) and Re, more sensibly, as a loc. Because of the accent
difference and because a PN does nothing for us, I prefer Gr’s suggestion that it has
real lexical value (‘good melody’ or ‘having good melody’), though I confess I do
not understand why it would have this particular accent. It modifies loc. śárman: a
“shelter made of good melody” would either be the protective power of the sung
portion of the rite or the protection given by the “singing” fire (see vs. 9 above, with
Agni’s hymns).
As for cikitvánā, most interpr. take it as an instr. modifying kétena and
derived in some way from √cit. Old takes it as a deformation of the instr. of the pf.
part. cikitúṣā, which is metrically impossible in the cadence; others set up a nonce
stem cikitván-. By contrast I think cikitvánā should be divided into two words: cikit
vánā. The first belongs to the stem cikít- ‘perceptive, observant’ (4x) found only
otherwise in the nom. sg. (likewise cikít), twice of Agni (VIII.102.2, X.3.1). This
would be its vocative, differing only in its lack of accent. What remains is vánā,
which can be the neut. pl. of vána- ‘(piece of) wood’ (see 15a above), which is found
here in a possessive constr. with dat. túbhyam. In external sandhi we should, of
course, have expected *cikid vána, but I think the multiple exx. of cikitvā́n, cikitvas,
etc., could have produced a redactional change, once voc. cikit was no longer clearly
understood. (In the publ. tr. an asterisk should precede “O perceptive Agni” as well
as “pieces of wood.”)
Taking túbhyam as part of an independent clause solves another problem in
the other interpr., for there is no good way to construe it with pāda a. Ge must take it
26
as an honorary gen. with śárman (“in deiner Obhut”), but though the dative can
express possession in predicative usage, I do not think this is possible in attributive
usage. Re construes it instead with sacate, “(le poète) t&rsquo;obéit,” positing what I
consider an unprecedented case frame (dat. only) and meaning for sácate. (The
parallel he adduces, V.43.15, is to be taken differently, and in fact Re does not tr. it
in parallel fashion himself.)
With túbhyam belonging to another clause, sacate is free to be construed with
the instr., as it regularly is. The instr. in question is kéta- ‘will, intention’, which is
regularly governed by ánu √i ‘follow’ (IV.26.2, etc.), semantically very close to
‘keep company with, be accompanied by’; cf. also keta-sáp- (V.38.3) ‘serving the
will’.
Ge renders iṣaṇyáyā as ‘nach Wunsch’, hence presumably to √iṣ ‘desire’, but
it seems arbitrary to separate it from the verb stem iṣaṇyá- ‘send, impel, drive’.</p>
<h3 id="viii6020">VIII.60.20</h3>
<p>The voc. āghṛṇīvaso is taken lit. by Ge and Re (‘Glutreicher’ and ‘riche
en ardeur-de-feu’ respectively). But ā́ghr̥ṇi- is an epithet exclusively of Pūṣan, and it
is highly unlikely that it would be used only here, in this awkward compound,
without that reference. So it must mean ‘who has the goods of Pūṣan’ &ndash; presumably
the cows and other domestic stuff that are appropriate to this last pragātha.</p>
<h2 id="viii61-indra">VIII.61 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii611">VIII.61.1</h3>
<p>The ca in pāda a is subordinating, as the accented verb (śṛṇávat) shows.
See Klein DGRV I.245-46.
Ge, flg. Sāy, suggests that the twofold speech (ubháyaṃ vácaḥ) is Gesang and
Vortrag. This is certainly possible, though I wonder if it might be refined to words
and melody – that is, not separate performances of songs and recitations, but words
set to music – accounting for the grammatical singular.</p>
<h3 id="viii614">VIII.61.4</h3>
<p>On áprāmi-satya see Scar 388, inter alia. With him and others (see already
Gr) I take the first member as derived from prá √mī, but in the common idiom
‘confound’. In my view the compound concerns a regularly expressed anxiety about
Indra – does he exist? See, e.g., VIII.100.3 néndro astī́ti néma u tva āha “‘Indra does
not exist,’ so says many a one.” Our compound addresses this by calling him one
“whose reality cannot be confounded.” Ge’s “der sein Versprechen nie bricht”
assumes a meaning ‘promise’ for satyá- that I don’t think is justified for the RV.
Scar’s “dessen Wahrheit unwandelbar ist” is closer to mine, but I don’t think his
rendering of the first member is sufficiently pointed.</p>
<h3 id="viii616-1">VIII.61.6</h3>
<p>Although paurá- is generally a PN in the RV (see Mayrhofer, Die
Personenname in der Ṛgveda-Saṃhitā s.v.), reflecting the patronymic it is
morphologically, here it cannot be so meant. Among other things, Indra cannot be a
descendent of Puru! In this passage it puns on purukṛ́t in the same pāda, as well as
purūvaso in 3a, purū́in 8a. Ge’s tr. takes account of this word play (“Mehrer der
27
Rossherde”), but I don’t think that it should be construed with a genitive as he takes
it. I take both genitives (áśvasya … gávām) with purukṛ́t (so also Scar 76) and
interpret paurá- as ‘stemming from / related to much(ness)’, that is, ‘muchness
itself’; “multiplicity … multiplier” is an attempt to capture the pun in English
without undue awkwardness.
In c Ge (also Old) takes dā́nam as subject: “bei dir bleibt die Gabe niemals
aus,” but the verbal forms to √mṛdh are otherwise always transitive. Old cites
VII.59.4 as parallel, but the parallelism is only apparent and the verb there is also
transitive.</p>
<h3 id="viii617">VIII.61.7</h3>
<p>The two verbs in ab, éhi and vidā́, seem to conform to the quasi-serial-verb
construction (on which see A. Yates 2014 [UCLA IE Conference proceedings]), but
hí makes trouble for this assessment and trouble in general for the interpretation.
Since hí triggers verb accentuation, the first imperative should be accented ehí (that
is, ā + ihí), not éhi (that is, ā́+ ihi), as Old points out. He suggest that éhi is
parenthetical. This is possible, though ad hoc, but this still leaves the function of hí in
question. It could be interpreted in the mode of Brereton 2012, as marking the first of
two imperatives (in this case vidā́, if éhi is parenthetical) as the basis of the action of
the second. Such an interpretation is barely possible here; however, it seems
excessively complex, since it requires banishing the truly first imperative éhi from
structural consideration. My own ad hoc suggestion is that hí is over-represented in
this part of the hymn (2a, 2d, 3c, 5c, 6c) and has been inserted here without its usual
function and without triggering verbal accent. But this is of course not a satisfying
solution, though it does allow the QSV analysis to be maintained.
For impv. vidā́against Pp subj. vidā́ḥ, see comm. ad IX.19.6. Here the parallel
impvs. éhi and vāvṛṣasva reinforce an impv. interpr.
For the hapax céru- see EWA s.v. An association with √ci ‘perceive’ seems
possible. Ge is uncertain, tr. ‘seeking’, but in n. suggests ‘traveling’ (to √car).
Morphologically vāvṛṣasva is somewhat problematic: Lub takes it as the
medial perfect imperative to a subjunctive stem, Kü (474) more cautiously as a
“thematically built” imperative. (It is worth pointing out that a properly built pf. mid.
impv. would come out as *vāvṛkṣva and would be multiply ambiguous.
Thematicization would be a good strategy under these circumstances. For further
disc. of this set of “thematic” perfect imperatives see my 2018 “The Vedic Perfect
Imperative and the Status of Modal Forms to Tense-Aspect Stems” (Fs. Lubotsky) on
the perfect imperative.) As is generally noted, this imperative cannot be separated
from the medial participle vāvṛṣāná-, which in two of its three occurrences also
appears with úd. Following Neisser (1893, also Gotō 1987), Kü (474–77) assigns
these forms to a root √2
varṣ ‘sich ermannen, sich (tatendurstig) erheben’ (associated
with the present varṣāyáte, which however appears to be a denominative, not a root
formation) separate from √1
varṣ ‘regnen’ and translates our passage rather like Ge’s
“Ermannen dich…” I think this separation is unnecessary and also ignores the ā́
vṛṣasva in 3a. I find the liquid semantics of √vṛṣ ‘rain’ not only possible in all the úd
28
√vṛṣ passages but productive of a striking image: ‘bubble/boil up’, expressing
Indra’s irrespressible excitement and energy.</p>
<h3 id="viii619-1">VIII.61.9</h3>
<p>Thematically and lexically connected with the preceding verse (8) despite
straddling the pragātha boundary. In 8c we identify ourselves as vípravacas- ‘having
inspired speech’, and in 9ab it is said that either a vípra or a non-vípra might offer his
vácas- to Indra, with good results either way. Although this seems like a non-RVic
sentiment (esp. after 8c), since ordinarily only good poets (like us) are meant to
achieve success, perhaps the “inspired poet” is being implicitly contrasted with a
non-inspired but still skillful poet. In the other occurrence of aviprá- in the RV
(VI.45.2), Indra “places vitality even in the uninspired,” so perhaps, alternatively,
here even the uninspired poet achieves success simply by dedicating his product to
Indra and acquiring luster by this contact.
The accusative of the offering with √vidh is a bit unusual, but not
unprecedented (see, e.g., I.189.1), and Ge’s rather deviant tr. “die Rede recht
gemacht hat” and his alternative suggestion that vácaḥ represents vácasā at the end
of the pāda are both unnecessary.
On the apparent bad cadence produced by ávidhat, see remarks ad II.1.7,
where Arnold’s suggestion to read a long augment is adopted.
The apparent subj. mamandat certainly can work as a subjunctive in context
and is so rendered in the publ. tr. However, note that it immediately precedes t
u
vāyā́,
beg. with t-, and we might be dealing with an unetymological doubling from an
underlying *mamanda tu
vāyā́. The final syllable of the verb would then be light, but
this doesn’t cause major metrical problems. Nonetheless, I’m inclined to stick with
the subjunctive. On the other hand, on the basis of VII.18.21 and VII.33.1, I now
think it is possible that prá mamanda(t) should be interpr. as transitive, with ‘you’
[=Indra] supplied as object, perhaps as haplology from *tvā tvāyā́as I suggest ad
VII.18.21. For the motivations for this reinterpr., see disc. there. The altered tr.
would be “… will exhilarate / has exhilarated (you) in devotion to you.” On the other
hand, the intrans. interpr. in the publ. tr. makes slightly more sense in this context &ndash;
and forms of √ma(n)d can be either trans. or intrans., so the current tr. could be
maintained.
The voc. ahaṃsana is surely rightly explained (Old ad V.75.2, AiG II.1.327,
III.437) as a univerbation of a VP aháṃ sanā “I shall win” (see V.75.2 for another
instantiation of this phrase). (AiG II.1.327 suggests aháṃ saneyam, but the thematic
subjunctive matches the compound better.)</p>
<h3 id="viii6110">VIII.61.10</h3>
<p>Ge tr. yádi as ‘So’, which does not seem legitimate to me. It might be
possible to read it as *yád ī, even without a following cluster (see Jamison 2002)
“when he will hear my call,” but I don’t see that this appreciably improves sense.</p>
<h3 id="viii6111">VIII.61.11</h3>
<p>Kulikov (339–40, flg. Gotō) does not allow a passive reading for medial
forms of √man, but aside from Gotō’s dictum I see nothing against such an
interpretation, which fits the passage better than a reflexive one.
29
The hapax árāya- is plausibly taken as a negated form derived from the root
√rā ‘give, bestow’ by Mayrhofer EWA s.v. rayí-.
jáḷhu- (i.e., jáḍhu-) is also a hapax with no agreed-upon etymology or
meaning. Ge leaves it untr. and Old simply comments “dunkel.” See EWA s.v. for
references to previous discussions and suggestions. I wonder if it is not related to
jaṭhára- ‘belly’, with MIA voicing of intervocalic obstruent between vowels (cf. Pkt.
jaḍhara- ‘belly’ cited in EWA s.v. jaṭhára- [though not registered in Turner]), with
“belly” as the designation of a greedy, voracious person.
The point of the verse seems to be that we don’t want to get a bad reputation
for being selfish by grabbing Indra to be our exclusive companion.</p>
<h3 id="viii6112">VIII.61.12</h3>
<p>The second member of the hapax compound ṛṇá-kāti- belongs with
kā́makāti- ‘desiring desires’, and I therefore produce a more volition tr. than the
usual ‘Schuld fordernd’.
The interpretation of the second hemistich depends on the interpretation of
bhṛmám. Gr takes it as ‘error’, Ge as ‘impatience’ (Ungeduld), and see EWA s.v. for
other suggestions. I consider it a derivative of √bhram ‘whirl’, and see it here as
qualifying the vā́jin-, the prize-winning horse. The point is that a good charioteer
recognizes a good horse even when it’s going so fast it becomes a whirling blur. And
this fast horse is the one that the knowledgeable charioteer wants and will obtain.
Ge’s interpretation is very different: “Der Gewinner … versteht die Ungeduld, die
den Sieggewohnten erfasst.” He takes bhṛmám as a noun, the object of védā, and the
referent of the relative pronoun in d. Since he considers that rel. pronoun the subject
of náśat, he must account for acc. yám by assuming attraction to vājínam from
expected nom. *yáḥ. My interpretation avoids this unappealing change and also
accounts better for the position of the particles íd ū, since vājínam belongs to the
main clause not the relative clause, by my reading. Moreover, náśat should be a
subjunctive, but his tr. fails to register that.</p>
<h3 id="viii6113">VIII.61.13</h3>
<p>Pāda b would literally be “make lack of fear of that for us,” which is
overly stilted.
Pāda c reprises 5ab.</p>
<h3 id="viii6114">VIII.61.14</h3>
<p>Old takes rādhaspate as a predicated vocative, presumably with at least
rā́dhaso máhaḥ and possibly kṣáyasya dependent on it. Ge (whom I follow) supplies
a “lord” for those dependent genitives, which may amount to the same thing.</p>
<h3 id="viii6115">VIII.61.15</h3>
<p>The sandhi form índra that opens pāda a can be either vocative or
nominative. Because of the 3rd ps. verbs of cd, I take it as nominative.</p>
<h2 id="viii62-indra">VIII.62 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii623">VIII.62.3</h3>
<p>Gr, Ge take áhita- as ‘useless’ (untauglich), the negation of what I think of
as a later specialized sense of hitá- as ‘useful, beneficial, friendly’, which is not, as
30
far as I know, found in the RV. In his n. Ge allows the possibility of connection with
√hi ‘spur on’ (which is Sāy’s view), and this seems the better choice. Parallel
phraseology supports it: IV.7.11 hinvé árvā, V.36.2 árvato ná hinván, plus the
numerous exx. of √hi + áśva-, átya-, and other words for horses. Ge’s cited parallel,
VI.45.2 anāśúnā cid árvatā “even with a steed lacking speed,” also provides support.
I use the “be about to” sense, always possible for desideratives, to tr. siṣāsati,
rather than ‘desires to win’. The question is not whether Indra wants to win – of
course he does – but that he is about to win despite unfavorable circumstances. The
‘about to’ sense also works better with the future part. kariṣyatáḥ in d.</p>
<h3 id="viii625-1">VIII.62.5</h3>
<p>The interpretation of this verse rests on whose mind (mánas-) is at issue.
Ge. considers it to belong to the mortal worshiper and makes it the object of kṛṇóṣi:
“Da du … selbst des Kühnen Sinn (noch) kühn(er) machst …,” which also entails
interpreting plain dhṛṣát as a comparative. By contrast I consider the mind to be
Indra’s and take pāda a as a separate nominal sentence. This has the advantage also
of putting yád in b in a more acceptable syntactic position. In V.35.4 the dhṛṣán
mánaḥ is unarguably Indra’s; the full expression in I.54.3 dhr̥ṣató dhrṣ̥ án mánaḥ “the
bold mind of the bold one” also refers to Indra.
As for the rest of the verse, I take the gen. participles saparyatáḥ (c) and
pratibhū́ṣataḥ (d) as genitives of benefit. This has the slight disadvantage of positing
different referents for these two participles and for dhṛṣatáḥ in a, but it would hardly
be the first time that a RVic verse contained genitives referring to different entities,
and there is considerable distance between dhṛṣatáḥ and the others.</p>
<h3 id="viii626">VIII.62.6</h3>
<p>As Ge suggests, the object of Indra’s gazing should be the soma, parallel
to the wells (avatā́n) of the simile. As he also suggests, the avatā́n can
simultaneously refer to soma-springs (Somabrunnen), and so I have tr. the word
twice, in simile and frame.
Ge construes the gen. phrase dákṣasya somínaḥ with the gerund juṣṭvī́. This is
probably correct; my “make X [acc.] of Y [gen.]” goes suspiciously easily into
English, but in Sanskrit the construction would probably involve a double accusative.
I would thus change the publ. tr. to “Finding pleasure in the skillful provider of soma,
he makes (him) a partner …”</p>
<h3 id="viii628">VIII.62.8</h3>
<p>Ge takes the dat. devátātaye with cd: “dass du für die Götterschaft mit
Übermacht den Vṛtra erschlägst.” This has some immediate appeal, but I am
reluctant to adopt it because both the hemistich-break and the yád intervene.
Moreover, the use of present tense háṃsi suggests that the Vṛtra-smashing continues
in the present day and is perhaps separate from the primal act performed for the
benefit of the gods in mythological time.</p>
<h3 id="viii629">VIII.62.9</h3>
<p>There are various ways to configure the nominals in the first hemistich,
sámaneva vapuṣyatáḥ … mā́nuṣā yugā́, and their relation to the verb kṛṇávat. Most
interpretors assume (I think correctly) that kṛṇávat takes a double accusative here
31
(“make X into Y”), but which is the X and which the Y? Ge takes mā́nuṣā yugā́as
the first object and sámaneva vapuṣyatáḥ as the second: “Er soll die menschlichen
Geschlechter gleichsam zu anstaunenden Versammlungen machen,” but does not
explain how masc. vapuṣyatáḥ can modify neut. sámanā. Old discusses the passage
at length, but in all four translations he suggests as possible he also takes mā́nuṣā
yugā́as the first object. However, this phrase is almost always an accusative of extent
of time “through the human generations” (I.144.4, II.2.2, V.52.4, VI.16.23,
VIII.46.12). If we take it that way here and thus exclude it from one of the two
accusative object slots with kṛṇávat, the remaining two nominals can each take one
of the slots. The point then is that generation after generation people/gods marvel at
Indra, and all these people oohing-and-aahing are like big festive parties.</p>
<h3 id="viii6211">VIII.62.11</h3>
<p>The full specification of the subject of the 1st dual verb sáṃ yujyāva as
aháṃ ca tváṃ ca is noteworthy, since generally the subject is reduced by gapping, as
in VII.88.3 ā́yád ruhā́va váruṇaś ca nā́vam “When we two, (I) and Varuṇa, mounted
the boat …” VIII.34.16 índraś ca dádvahe “We two, (I) and Indra, took …,”</p>
<h3 id="viii697">VIII.69.7</h3>
<p>úd yád … gṛhám índraś ca gánvahi “when we two, (I) and Indra , go up to
his house….” (Of course all those examples involve 1st ps. exclusive, rather than
inclusive as here.) The increasing emphasis in this hymn on partnership between god
and human discussed in the publ. intro. accounts for the explicit “both I and you”
here.</p>
<h3 id="viii6212">VIII.62.12</h3>
<p>satyám íd vā́u is found as a unit at V.73.9, and I therefore think that táṃ
vayám, índraṃ stavāma should be detached from both what precedes and what
follows. See also expressions like satyáṃ tád (III.39.5, VIII.59.3), satyám ít tád
(VI.30.4), introducing a separable statement of truth.</p>
<h2 id="viii63-indra">VIII.63 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii631">VIII.63.1</h3>
<p>The two parallel perfects ānaje and ānajé, each final in its hemistich,
require two different functional interpretations, the first passive, the second transitive,
with a double accusative. Kü (95–96) recognizes more or less the same two functions
(patientiv and agentiv-reflexiv) for this perfect stem, but curiously claims that the
perfect to this root is found only in Maṇḍalas I and X, though offering no alternative
interpretation of these forms here.
Various referents have been suggested for the vená-: Indra (Old), Soma (Ge).
I favor Agni, for the following reasons. First, the actions of ab and cd, whose
correspondence is signalled by the identical verbs, take place in the divine realm in
ab and in the human one in cd, where Manu directs his action to the divine. This
situation suggests a ritual scene, and the Vena, who is the target of both acts of
smearing, should then be a middleman between the divine and human in the ritual.
This figure can only be Agni or Soma. As for the rest of the vocabulary, pūrvyá- can
be used of Agni, Soma, and Indra, but is most regularly Agni. Likewise Agni is often
the object of √añj; cf. esp. III.14.3 yát sīm añjánti pūrvyáṃ havírbhiḥ. And Agni
32
several times opens doors (e.g., I.128.6, III.5.1, VIII.39.6). With Agni covertly
mentioned in this verse and Soma overtly in vs. 2, the whole ritual scene is set.</p>
<h3 id="viii632">VIII.63.2</h3>
<p>The sense of mā́na- here is disputed. Ge takes it as “Melodie,” explained
ad I.39.1 as via “Tonbemessen, Intonation”; Old “Himmelshaus.” Although my
interpretation of mā́na- as ‘measure’ shares a root etymology with Ge’s (at least as
he sees it, but cf. EWA s.vv. mā́na2
, mā́na3
), namely √mā ‘measure’, I take it in a
fairly literal sense — the measure of heaven is the distance to it — and as an acc. of
goal. See also 7d.
As far as I can see, úd √sad occurs only here in the RV. Ge takes it as “make
a pause,” but gives no grounds for this interpretation. Although already in the BYV
Saṃhitās this lexeme can mean ‘go out, (tr.) put out [of fire]’, here a literal meaning
‘sit up’ fits the context very well. The pressing stones are raised up in preparation for
pressing; note that the grā́van-, also ‘pressing stone’, are ūrdhvá- ‘erect’ in X.92.15,
a situation also embodied in the compound ūrdhvá-grāvan-.</p>
<h3 id="viii633">VIII.63.3</h3>
<p>stuṣé could alternatively be 1st sg. ‘I shall praise’. I interpret it as an
infinitive, with Ge, because there has been so far no personal reference to the poet.
But this is not a strong argument, esp. since “we” make an appearance in vs. 4.
The mention of the opening of the Vala cave may allude to the dawn, and
therefore to the dawn happening at this sacrifice now.</p>
<h3 id="viii634-1">VIII.63.4</h3>
<p>vakṣáṇi- is derivationally ambiguous: Gr takes it to √vakṣ ‘grow, increase’,
Ge to √vah ‘convey’, though not with entire confidence (“Wortführer (?)”), AiG
II.2.207 allows both. Both are possible in the realm of RVic discourse. I opt for
√vakṣ because the expression is parallel to kavivṛdháḥ ‘strengthener of poets’, but I
certainly don’t rule out a derivation from √vah.
Another ambiguous word is hóman- in c; this stem can mean either
‘invocation’ (to √hū) or ‘pouring, oblation’ (to √hu). Gr takes it to the latter, Ge,
apparently (‘Darbringung’) to the former. I agree with Ge: the trope of pouring out
praise is common in the RV.</p>
<h3 id="viii635">VIII.63.5</h3>
<p>The syntactic association of várasya is disputed; see Old’s discussion for
various possibilities. I follow Ge in taking it as dependent on krátum.
It also seems necessary to supply a verb with ab. I import anūṣata from cd,
with svā́hā the cry that the sacrificers cry out; however, Ge’s ‘entsprechen’, utilizing
the preverb ánu present in pāda a, is also possible, though he must take svā́hā as a
syntactic absolute (“unter Svāhāruf”).
Ge takes śvātrám as the content of the call (“… haben … den Drang
eingeschrieen”), but √nu ordinarily takes as object the being towards whom the cry
is directed, and I therefore take śvātrám as referring to Indra. (This standard
construction of √nu does make some trouble for my interpretation of svā́hā as
construed with supplied √nu in ab, but perhaps the fact that svā́hā expresses the cry
itself makes the difference. See comm. on I.6.6, however.)
33
Note the phonological echoes: ā́(d ū) nú … ánu (a) / anūṣata (c).</p>
<h3 id="viii636-1">VIII.63.6</h3>
<p>I see no reason to attenuate the identification of Indra with the adhvaráthat the grammar seems to demand, by a contrivance like Ge’s “den die Preislieder
als (Gegenstand) des Gottesdienstes kennen.” See I.178.4, where Indra is identified
with “the laud of the sacrificer” (yájamānasya śáṃsaḥ), and the immediately
following verse (63.7d), where he is identified with peaceful dwelling (kṣáyaḥ).</p>
<h3 id="viii637">VIII.63.7</h3>
<p>The second hemistich has been subject to various interpretations. See,
inter alia, Old’s discussion, also Thieme (Fremdl. 42–43). The primary points of
difference are the case/number of vipáḥ (gen. sg. or acc. pl.) and of aryáḥ (gen. sg. or
acc. pl.), the sense of mā́na- (as also in vs. 2), and the syntactic structure of the final
pāda. I opt for gen. sg. vipáḥ (as Old points out, the acc. pl. should be accented vípaḥ),
acc. pl. aryáḥ, and the same sense for mā́na- as in vs. 2, namely ‘measure’ – in this
case the measure, i.e., the sheer size, of Indra. I construe both genitives (vipáḥ and
mā́nasya) with barháṇā, and take the last two words sá kṣáyaḥ as a separate clause,
as the position of sá might suggest – contra all other intrepretations I am aware of. It
makes sense that Indra should be identified as “peaceful dwelling,” because he has
killed the strangers and thus brought peace to the Five Peoples.</p>
<h3 id="viii638-1">VIII.63.8</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., “the turning of the wheel” (cakrásya vartaním)
recalls the later designation for a universal monarch cakra-vartin ‘turner of the
wheel’. The association of cakráṃ with √vṛt ‘turn’ is found elsewhere in the RV
(cakráṃ ná vrttám ̥ I.155.6 = IV.31.4 = V.36.3; and a number of VPs, e.g., I.164.11
várvarti cakrám, II.11.20 ávartayat sū́ryo ná cakrám), but this seems the passage
most implicated in power and sovereignty.</p>
<h3 id="viii639-2">VIII.63.9</h3>
<p>Pāda a contains a textual problem: whether to read the transmitted
vyódana (-e [so Pp.] or -aḥ, out of sandhi) ‘moistening/moistener’) or to emend to vy
òdaná (i.e., -é) ‘rice-porridge’, the food associated with the Emuṣa myth that is
treated virtually only in this part of VIII (the odanám in 69.14; 77.6, 10). See Ge and
Old ad loc. I follow Ge in the emendation; it is very difficult to make sense of the
‘moisten’ interpretation, and the rarity of odanám might have lead it to be changed.
In the publ. tr. there should be an asterisk before “to the rice-porridge.”</p>

<p>Supplying ‘praise-hymn’ or the like as object of dádhānāḥ, which goes
back to Sāy, is supported by VII.73.1 práti stómaṃ devayánto dádhānāḥ.
As Ge points out yuṣmā́bhiḥ may refer either to the gods or to the other
singers. On the basis of 11, I think the latter is more likely (so also Ge), although
note the gods in 12d.</p>
<h3 id="viii6311">VIII.63.11</h3>
<p>Ge takes ṛtvíyāya dhā́mane as referring to the Maruts (as the
“pünktlichen Geschlechten” [timely race], a phrase that doesn’t make a lot of sense
to me) or Indra. On the basis of V.48.1 priyā́ya dhā́mne &hellip; svákṣatrāya sváyavase “or
34
the self-ruling, self-glorious one … for his own dear establishment,” I take this as
referring to the establishment of Indra at the sacrifice, governed by the sacrificial
order, which the singers are hoping for. This establishment is then stated as
accomplished in 12c yáḥ … dhā́yi “who has been established …”
ṛ́kvabhiḥ reminds us of the insistent arká of the 2nd tṛca (4c, 5c, 6c); the same
verb √nu ‘cry out’ is repeated here, from 5c.</p>
<h3 id="viii6312">VIII.63.12</h3>
<p>I have no idea what the mountains have to do with anything and why they
and the Maruts should be in agreement. (Ge takes sajóṣāḥ only with the mountains,
but this doesn’t help.) Since there is in fact no overt ‘and’, it is possible that the
Maruts are being referred to as mountains (“… the Rudras, ‘mountains’ in their
profusion, are of one accord…”).
The relativization in cd is somewhat shifty: the yáḥ should refer to Indra, who
is the first member of the compound in the main clause índrajyeṣṭhāḥ ‘having Indra
as chief’.</p>
<h2 id="viii64-indra">VIII.64 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii644-1">VIII.64.4</h3>
<p>I take kṣáyo diví as a nominal sentence, parenthetically inserted, rather
than interpreting kṣáyaḥ as a 2nd sg. verb form, as most others do. See Old on the two
possibilities. Although it makes some complications for the syntax, I prefer the
nominal interpretation both because kṣáya- is, as Old says, a favored noun in this
group of hymns and because a verbal kṣáyaḥ should be a subjunctive and I do not see
what the subjunctive would be conveying here. (Ge tr. it as a straight indicative,
which avoids the difficulty but contravenes the morphology.) Stating that Indra’s
dwelling is in heaven makes clear why we command him to “go forth” in order to
“come here.”</p>
<h3 id="viii649">VIII.64.9</h3>
<p>dāná-, so accented, regularly means ‘giving’, not ‘gifts’’; I would alter the

<p>The morphological identity of the forms gṛṇīṣé and stuṣé is disputed. Ge
takes them as 2nd sg. passives (favored also by Old), though he mentions the
possibility that they are 1st sg. -se forms in his n.; Lub identifies them as 1st singulars.
I take them as infinitives rather than 1st sgs, primarily because they are accented.
However, it is possible that a finite verb would bear the accent after the accented
initial voc. índra, and that the second form would be accented contrastively, so 1st sg.
is certainly not excluded. Since the “you” of the publ. tr. (/ “dich” of Ge’s tr.) is not
overtly expressed, either interpretation fits the text.

<h3 id="viii661">VIII.66.1</h3>
<p>The nominative plural pres. part. gā́yantaḥ in c and the 1st singular huvé in
d are grammatically incompatible but conceptually harmonious: this is the usual
situation where the poet speaks both for himself and for the group of officiants he
represents. Ge takes abc together and supplies a 1st plural verb (rufen wir), while I
assume that the huvé of d has domain over the whole verse, with the plural participle
in c a grammatical interruption.</p>
<h3 id="viii662">VIII.66.2</h3>
<p>My tr. of pāda b sounds in English like a loc. absol. or a relative clause,
but is simply an attempt to keep the pāda together in tr. The acc. suśiprám of course
simply picks up the rel. prn. yám that opens the verse.
Ge tr. ādṛ́tyā as “fürsorglich” and so must assign it to a separate root √dṛ ‘pay
heed’. I instead take the form to √dṛ ‘burst, tear’ (a possibility Ge registers in his n.).
See EWA s.v. DARI for the likelihood that the later ā́√dṛ ‘pay heed’ forms
developed as semantic specializations of ‘tear out’.</p>
<h3 id="viii663">VIII.66.3</h3>
<p>The first hemistich contains two hapaxes with which Indra is identified.
The meaning and etymology of neither of them can be certainly determined.
The first one, mṛkṣá-, is the easier, because a root etymology suggests itself
(though without imposing itself) and because the adjective qualifying it, áśvya-
‘belong to a horse, equine’, narrows the semantic field. If the form belongs to the
root √mṛj ‘wipe, groom’, a mṛkṣá- can be a curry comb (so Ge, EWA s.v. MARJ,
both with uncertainty) or other tool for grooming a horse. (The supposed root
√mrakṣ ‘comb’ to which Gr and AiG II.2.71 assign it does not exist.) Possibly
connected is the hapax mrk̥ ṣínī- (X.98.6), where the word seems to describe the
tracks on the earth made by a hard rain – possibly envisioned as the regularly spaced
impressions left by a comb. Why calling Indra a curry comb would be flattering to
the god is not clear. Perhaps it’s one of those cultural mysteries like (semi-)modern
Engl. “you’re the cat’s pajamas.” Or perhaps, like the farm implement the harrow,
which likewise has teeth and is pulled across land to break up clods, etc., and which
has developed in English into a verb expressing the infliction of distress, the curry
comb can be conceived of as a weapon.
The second hapax, kī́ja-, is harder, because there is no apparent root
etymology, no similar forms attested in the RV, and, although it is also accompanied
by an adjective, that particular adj. ‘golden’ (hiraṇyáya-) leaves the field very wide.
Note also that, properly speaking, the velar should have yielded a palatal before ī, but
there are enough secondary ki/ī forms to keep this from being a useful diagnostic. Ge
suggests, tentatively, “Sporn” (spur) (sim., and similarly tentative, EWA), but gives
no support. I very hesitantly adduce the later (Ep+) kīcaka- ‘hollow bamboo’ and
suggest that kī́ja might be a ‘stake’. Note the hiraṇyáyo vetasáḥ “golden reed” in
IV.58.5. Being called a golden stake seems a bit better than being a horse’s curry
comb.

<p>Since váśat is a subjunctive, strictly speaking it should be tr. “as he will

<h3 id="viii667">VIII.66.7</h3>
<p>The balance of opinion (Gr, Kü, Lub, etc.) takes apīpema to √pī ‘swell’,
which morphologically makes sense. But Ge seems to take it rather as a redupl. aor.
to √pā ‘drink’ (“Wir haben ihn … hier getränkt…”), though without explicitly
saying so. See also the very parallel passage VIII.99.1, with ápīpyan. Despite the
difficulties (amply treated by Kü), I prefer to associate these two forms with √pā.
The transitive -áya-formation pāyáyati ‘makes drink’ is well attested in the RV. It is
a little difficult to figure out what a corresponding reduplicated aorist should look
like. Since √pā is not an orthodox long-ā root, it doesn’t make a p-causative (type
sthāpayati) and therefore would not import the -p- into the redupl. aorist (type
átiṣṭhipat). One might expect, based on its -áya-stem, to produce *ápīpayat if
thematic (type dīdharat) and *ápīpet (type dīdhar[t]) if athematic, with the weak
form to be expected *ápīpima. Whether the form belongs to pī or pā, the full-grade in
the root syllable of this form must be secondary, and if it’s not a problem to extend
the full grade to the weak form of pī, it should likewise be unproblematic with pā. It
is true, however, that the ‘swell’ root is possible and that the forms of the perfect of
√pī and the putative redupl. aor. of √pā would be hopelessly mixed up formally and
not terribly separate semantically. For ápīpyan in VIII.99.1 see disc. there.</p>
<h3 id="viii668">VIII.66.8</h3>
<p>Ge takes the wolf of ab as a simile, compared with the unexpressed Indra:
“Wie der wilde Wolf … wartet er auf seine Zeiten.” But this requires taking cid as a
simile marker, which I am loath to do. I consider it a general statement about nature
— wolves follow their own patterns, however much they appear to be acting
randomly. Indra, though he is apparently uncontrollable, attends to our ritual patterns
and will come when called (which is similar to what vs. 7 says &ndash; same yesterday,
same today). So, although the behavior of the wolf is a point of comparison for
Indra’s behavior, it is not a simile in the narrow sense. A similar comparison but in a
real simile is found in VIII.33.8 &hellip; mr̥gó ná vāraṇáḥ, purutrā́caráthaṃ dadhe &ldquo;Like a
wild elephant he has established his wandering [= his territory] in many places,&rdquo;
where Indra is compared to a wild beast and the territory is somewhat like the
vayúna- here.
On ā́√bhūṣ with vayúna-, see I.182.1.
Ge takes d as a separate clause, apparently supplying a form of √cit ‘appear’
(“erscheine …”), presumably based on citráyā and to be construed with prá.
Although the position of prá is suggestive, I do not see that separating the pādas is
necessary, since d fits easily with c.</p>
<h3 id="viii669">VIII.66.9</h3>
<p>Because asya is unaccented, it needs to be construed separately from

<h3 id="viii6610">VIII.66.10</h3>
<p>My interpretation of pāda a is quite different from Ge’s and starts from
the rhetorical structure of the four questions in vss. 9–10. Three of these (9ab, 9cd,
10b) are negative questions, in which the negative is part of the predicate: 9a ákr̥tam,
9c ná śuśruve, 10b ástrtam̥ . 10a also contains a negation, ádhṛṣtāḥ, but in Ge’s tr. it is
not predicated: “Was sind seine grossen, unangreifbaren Kräfte?” Furthermore his tr.
implicitly equates neut. sg. kád with fem. pl. táviṣīḥ. These problems can be fixed by
taking kád as a question marker, not an interrogative pronoun, and by assuming that
the powers in question are not Indra’s (as Ge takes them), but those of Indra’s
enemies. The implied answer to the rhetorical question is “no, there exist no powers
that Indra can’t assail.” For táviṣī belonging to others, see, e.g., I.80.10 índro
vṛtrásya táviṣīṃ nír ahan …
The hapax bekanā́ṭa- is an almost textbook example of non-Indo-Aryan
phonology (see Kuiper, Aryans), and it seems safest to take it as the name of a people,
rather than in the traditional interpretation (going back to the Nirukta VI.26
bekanāṭāḥ khalu kusīdino bhavanti) as “Wucherer” (usurer, profiteer) as Ge does.

<p>ápūrvyā [sic, not, as in Aufrecht and HvN, ápūrvya] and purūtámāsaḥ

predecessors – a variation on the usual theme of the “newest hymn.”</p>
<h3 id="viii6612">VIII.66.12</h3>
<p>Ge and Old make heavier weather of ab than seems necessary, motivated
in part by tvé rather than tvā in a and the positioning of the verb in b rather than a,
near to ūtáyaḥ. Ge supplies a form of √dhā in a, “Zwar werden viele Hoffnungen auf
dich (gesetzt),” and takes hávante as passive, “und werden deine Hilfen …
angerufen.” But the stem háva- is overwhelmingly transitive. Old suggests taking
ūtáyaḥ as accusative pl., which would do even more violence to the grammar. I take
the subject of hávante to be āśásaḥ ‘hopes’. As for tvé: although √hū ordinarily takes
the accusative, I can imagine a locatival tvé in a more distanced usage: they call
towards you, but they do not actually succeed. (Alternatively the tvé could have been
influenced by tvé in 13a, in the same metrical position, though metrically distracted.)
I then take ūtáyaḥ as a separate existential clause.</p>
<h3 id="viii6614">VIII.66.14</h3>

<p>ádbhutainasaḥ is generally taken as a gen. sg., parallel to ánāgasaḥ in b.
But since the only other ex. of this stem modifies the Maruts in V.87.7, I think it
likely that it is a nom. pl. modifying the Ādityas. Moreover there is no NOM + ásti
38
construction in c as there are in a and b. There is perhaps too much machinery in the
tr., to indicate that it is not the Ādityas’ offenses, but those of others, that cannot
deceive or mislead them (=the gods), but given the Ādityas’ character, I think the
internal structure of the cmpd would be clear to the audience.</p>
<h3 id="viii678">VIII.67.8</h3>
<p>What to supply with mahé is somewhat up in the air, but some equivalent
of Ge’s “Glück” seems harmless enough.
I don’t understand Indra’s role here. Is the idea that Varuṇa &amp; Co. should not
be getting any ideas about tying us up, because only Indra gets to do such things? But
this would run counter to Varuṇa’s role, at least in later Vedic, of binding offenders.
In any case the theme of binding recurs in this hymn; cf. vss. 14, 18.</p>
<h3 id="viii679">VIII.67.9</h3>
<p>In ab I supply a transitive form of √mṛc ‘harm’ to be construed with the
cognate instr. root noun. The fact that the verb of pāda c, (abhí prá) mṛkṣata, though
derived from √mṛś ‘touch’, could technically be an s-formation to √mṛc makes the
generation of a verb from that root easier, and in fact we might consider mṛkṣata as
representing both ‘harm’ and ‘seize’. Old notes the phonological play.
In its other two occurrences aviṣyú- has the negative sense ‘greedy’ and is
clearly related to avasá- ‘food’, etc. (see EWA s.v. avasá-), but here it must be
positive. I assume a portmanteau pun, combining ‘greedy’ with an association with
√av ‘help’, resulting in ‘greedy[=eager] to help’.</p>
<h3 id="viii6712">VIII.67.12</h3>
<p>Since anehás- is an adjective, a noun needs to be supplied with it (contra
Ge, Re). I supply ‘shelter’ on the basis of VIII.18.21 (also a hymn to the Ādityas)
containing aneháḥ … trivárūtham … chardíḥ, with the várūtha- and chardís- found
in our vss. 3b, 6b.
VIII.67.12–13: The correlative of yé in 13 is té in 14, but this unremarkable pairing
actually conceals a bit of trickery: yé has 3rd ps. reference, but té has 2nd ps. reference,
with the impv. mumócata &ndash; with a change in person in midstream that is not evident
until the verb is reached at the end of pāda b.</p>
<h3 id="viii6715">VIII.67.15</h3>
<p>The doubling of 1st pl. pronouns, naḥ … asmát can be interpr. in two
different ways. On the one hand, naḥ can be just a Wackernagel-position placeholder,
doubled by the more emphatic (and case-marked) asmát later in the vs. Of course
enclitic naḥ is not technically supposed to represent an ablative, but I think that all
bets are off with Wackernagel-position pronominal enclitics. Or the naḥ can actually
be an accusative, construed with ájaghnuṣī.</p>

<p>The preverb ví is excessively represented in this vs., with 5 occurrences
(including víṣvak) and its usual contrastive partner sám in the middle. Note also the
figure … aṃhatím# … sámhitam#.
aṃhatím also makes a faint ring with the same word in 2a.</p>
<h2 id="viii68-indra">VIII.68 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii682">VIII.68.2</h3>

<h3 id="viii683">VIII.68.3</h3>
<p>The hapax participle jmāyánt- is clearly built to the adverbial instr. jmā́
belonging to the ‘earth’ word (kṣám-, etc.). The pári preceding it can be read both
with the verb īyatuḥ and with jmāyánt-. Cf. párijman- and EWA s.v. As for what it
means for a mace to encircle the earth, it is probably a measure of its size, which
then indicates that Indra’s hands are even larger because they encircle the mace.</p>
<h3 id="viii684">VIII.68.4</h3>
<p>Although the sense of this verse is fairly clear, the second half-verse
displays some syntactic intricacies, namely, what I consider two conjoined NPs that
interact with each other in various ways and for which there is only one overt
conjunction, ca in somewhat anomalous position. I take the two pāda-initial
instrumentals évaiḥ and ūtī́as forming one NP, with both indicating qualities of
Indra’s (differently Ge, who takes évaiḥ with the verb: “rufe ich … mit Eifer”), and
the two pāda-final genitives carṣaṇīnā́m and ráthānām as a second NP, dependent on
either ūtī́alone or évaiḥ … ūtī́jointly. The single ca connects the two instrumentals
in an X ca Y construction. This seems to me superior to Klein’s interpretation
(DGRV I.172, 192–93) as a ca XY construction, with the ca conjoining the two
genitives. For évaiḥ as the quality of a god, not an adverb, see, e.g., X.67.11.</p>
<h3 id="viii687">VIII.68.7</h3>
<p>The accusative phrase in c, pūrvyā́m ánuṣṭutim, makes syntactic trouble
here. See disc. by Old, who lays out various possibilities. Ge takes the hemistich as
containing a zeugma, with (as far as I can determine) ī́śe read differently with the
two pādas &ndash; taking an accusative in c and meaning “Anrecht haben,” while taking a
genitive in d and meaning “herrschen über.” But among the numerous occurrences of
ī́ś-, I know of none with the meaning or case frame proposed for c. (For further disc.
see comm. ad VII.32.18.) Old suggests either supplying another verb (acodat?) or
taking the phrase as an Inhaltsakk. (though in what sense of that term I don’t
understand). I take it either as a haplologized *ánu ánuṣṭutim or as an acc. of respect.
(Note that Old rejects Ludwig’s suggestion to read *ánu ṣṭutím, but this would be
another possibility in my opinion. What perhaps speaks against that is the other
occurrence of ánuṣṭuti- in nearby VIII.63.8.)
40</p>
<h3 id="viii688">VIII.68.8</h3>
<p>I add a parenthetical “other” in ab, because Indra’s fellowship is
something we always aspire to (see vs. 11 below), and so to state baldly that no one
has achieved it seems defeatist.</p>
<h3 id="viii6810">VIII.68.10</h3>
<p>I take īmahe to √yā ‘beseech’, not ‘drive’ (contra Ge “… nahen wir…”).
There is a missing middle term between ab and c, namely what we are
imploring Indra for – presumaby the same help that he gave to Purumāyya.</p>
<h3 id="viii6814">VIII.68.14</h3>
<p>Ge supplies ‘horses’ with the numbers of pāda a, separating them from
the men of b: “… sechs (Rosse), je zwei und zwei, (und) die Herren…,” because the
next verse definitely has six horses. But Hoffmann’s (1967: 233) suggestion that
there are six men, who are the leaders of the horses, makes the verse less jerky and
avoids having to supply both a noun (horses) and a conjunction (and).
VIII.68.15–17: The donors of the various gifts are generally in the locative here and
so would be properly translated “bei,” “chez,” “at (the hands of) …” or the like, but a
series of locatival tr. is simply too heavy and awkward.
I have made no effort to sort out the internal relationships among the patrons
– a topic more than amply discussed in the sec. lit.</p>
<h3 id="viii6817">VIII.68.17</h3>
<p>vadhúmant- means literally ‘having women, brides’, but Ge raises the
question whether in this context it really refers to mares. I think this unlikely.
Dānastutis regularly lump horses and female humans together. Very parallel is
I.126.3 śyāvāḥ &hellip; vadhū́mantaḥ &hellip; ráthāsaḥ, “dusky (horses) and chariots carrying
brides.”</p>
<h3 id="viii6818">VIII.68.18</h3>
<p>I take the ruddy female (áruṣī) as a reference to Dawn, with the bull
accompanying her as the sun. This makes sense in a dakṣinā context, since the
priestly gifts are distributed at the dawn sacrifice. Ge rather as a mare.</p>
<h2 id="viii69-indra">VIII.69 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii691-1">VIII.69.1</h3>
<p>It is necessary to supply a verb for ab; Ge “Traget” but I supply “chant” on
the basis of the beginning of the second tṛca, 4ab abhí prá … arca, and the insistent
repetition in vs. 8: árcata prā́rcata, … árcata# / árcantu … arcata#. Pāda a is
essentially identical to VIII.7.1a prá yád vas triṣṭúbham íṣam, where the verb
governing the acc. is ákṣarat ‘has let flow’ (pāda b), which is not possible here. The
“Triṣṭubh refreshment” is obviously the praise hymn; interestingly neither this
passage nor VIII.7 is in Triṣṭubh meter.
The second hemistich is somewhat obscure, in part because, as Ge points out,
it is not clear who the subject is. Perhaps the “Triṣṭubh refreshment” (that is, the
praise), or the drop (that is, the soma) to which it is chanted, or the poet. (I favor the
praise hymn.) The pair dhī́- and púraṃdhī- appears elsewhere together (VIII.92.15,
X.65.13–14). Ge takes them here as names of the goddesses of religious poetry and
41
of the dakṣinā respectively. In VIII.92.15 I take them as qualities that Indra confers
on us, but here at least the dhī́- is probably that of the poet(s). Perhaps they are a
reciprocal, rather than parallel, pair: we receive plenty in exchange for insight (as in
V.41.6). The interpretation is further complicated by the fact that ā́vivāsaeverywhere else takes an accusative, often in conjunction with an instr. of means:
“seek to attract X with Y” (e.g., VIII.15.1 índraṃ gīrbhís taviṣám ā́vivāsata), but
there is no accusative immediately available. (Though vaḥ could technically be an
accusative, that interpretation seems unlikely here.) However, this is of course an
Indra hymn, and in thinking about this verse again, I have concluded that Indra
should be supplied here as the default object, and therefore for the publ. tr. I would
substitute “With your visionary thought and with plenitude it [=hymn] is seeking to
entice (Indra) here, in order to gain wisdom.” Cf. VIII.3.18 imé hí te kārávo vāvaśúr
dhiyā́, víprāso medhásātaye “For these bards, inspired poets, have bellowed for you
[=Indra] for the winning of wisdom with their insight,” with both dhiyā́and
medhásātaye in a similar context, where poets seek Indra.</p>
<h3 id="viii692">VIII.69.2</h3>
<p>Another verse with unclear reference: neither the 2nd singular subject of
iṣudhyasi nor the bull and cows are clearly identified, and it is complicated by the
fact that there are also two occurrences of 2nd plural vaḥ in the verse. I take the
subject to be the same as that of ā́vivāsati in 1d, namely the praise hymn, with the
common switch of persons. That the praise hymn is in reality inanimate is not in
RVic discourse an obstacle to addressing it. The 2nd pl. vaḥ is then the same group of
poets / ritual officiants as in 1a and 1c. As for the bull (nadá-, a and b) and the páti-
(c), I agree with Ge (n. 2) that it can be either Indra or soma. In the latter case, the
referent is then the same as the índu- ‘drop’ that was the target of the hymn in 1ab; in
the latter, the same as the unexpressed object of ā́vivāsati in 1cd. The cows are
easier to account for if soma is the referent: they would then be the mixing milk as so
often. If the bull is Indra, the cows may be the cows he brings us as largesse or praise
hymns conceived of as cows (many words for hymn are feminine), and the sexual
tinge of ab would be a nod to Indra’s hypersexuality. Probably both referents are
meant.
On iṣudhyasi see comm. ad I.128.6 and my forthcoming article “Vedic
iṣudhyá- and Old Avestan išud-, išūidiia-: The Aim of Praise.” Since I analyze
*iṣudh- as a root noun cmpd ‘aim an arrow’, a metaphor for aiming praise towards a
divine target, the nadám … pátim must refer to the god receiving praise. Indra or
Soma are both possible, of course.</p>
<h3 id="viii693">VIII.69.3</h3>
<p>The first two pādas seem rather briskly to clear up the uncertainties of the
previous verse, or give at least one reading thereof: soma, the cows that give the milk
to mix with soma, and Indra (though not by name) are all present, and their
relationships are clear.
The connection of the last half of the verse to what precedes is not clear, as
Ge also points out. The birth is likely to be that of soma, but why are we now
concerned with “the clans of the gods”? I tentatively assume that the gods are
42
awaiting their invitation to the soma-drinking in their usual abodes. Somewhat later
in the hymn (11b) all the gods partake of the soma.
There is number discrepancy between pl. triṣú and sg. rocané, as also in the
identical pāda in I.105.5b. On the basis of expressions like I.102.8 trī́ṇi rocanā́,
V.69.1 trī́rocanā́, I.149.4 trī́rocanā́ni the two words must be construed together and
a truncation of rocanéṣu must be assumed. I don’t quite know why, but Bloomfield
(RR ad I.105.5) points out that rocané diváḥ is a frequent cadence, and it therefore
may have imposed itself formulaically in this phrase. Also the alternation between trī́
and trī́ṇi and rocanā́and rocanā́ni in the formula may have made an alternative
rocané to rocanéṣu seem acceptable. In fact loc. pl. rocanéṣu is only attested once.</p>
<h3 id="viii694">VIII.69.4</h3>
<p>Although this verse belongs to a different tṛca, it seems to provide an
alternative resolution to the puzzle of vs. 2, somewhat different from that given in
3ab. Here Indra is definitively identified as a gópati- ‘lord of cows’, paraphrasing
2cd pátim … ághnyānāṃ dhenūnā́m.
Ge takes yáthā vidé as “wie er bekannt ist,” but this tag phrase regularly refers
to the traditional way of producing poetry or performing ritual. See, e.g., I.132.2,
VIII.13.14, IX.86.32.
satyásya sátpatim is probably a pseudo-pun, given that by many accounts
(including ours) sát-pati- derives from sáts-pati-, with the first member a reduction
of sádas- ‘seat, settlement’. See EWA s.v. If sát- belongs to √as (as some think), it is
a real pun.</p>
<h3 id="viii696">VIII.69.6</h3>
<p>Pāda c is presumably a reference to the Vala cave, as Ge points out.</p>
<h3 id="viii697-1">VIII.69.7</h3>
<p>Another elliptical 1st dual construction; for disc. see VIII.62.11.
Ge and Hoffmann, inter alia, take bradhnásya viṣṭápam to refer to the height
or top of the sun. The phrase occurs also in IX.113.10. bradhná- in VIII.4.13–14
seems to refer to soma. Since viṣṭáp- several times occurs with samudrásya
(VIII.34.13, 97.5=IX.12.6, IX.107.14), something liquid makes sense, rather than
wandering around on top of the sun. Furthermore, at least in IX.12.6 (and probably
IX.107.14) the “sea” in this expression is clearly soma. I also think that it works
better as acc. of extent, rather than as goal, since the goal is the grhám ̥ .
For the ceremonial aspects of the second hemistich see publ. intro. Note that
sákhi- is an integral part of the “seventh step” mantra at the wedding ceremony:
sakhā saptapadī bhava “Become a comrade of the seventh step” (ŚGS I.14.6, etc.;
see Jamison 1996: 121). Contra Hoffmann (1967: 255) I separate tríḥ from saptá, and
consider the former to refer to drinking soma at the three pressings (so also Ge). I
also take the cardinal saptá as if it were the ordinal saptátha-. For the corresponding
verse, see 16 below.</p>
<h3 id="viii699">VIII.69.9</h3>
<p>It is likely that all three of these obscure words, gárgara-, godhā́-, and
píṅgā-, are musical instruments, but further specification is difficult.

VIII.69.11-12: I do not understand why Varuṇa is mentioned specially. Perhaps
because of the waters of 11d and the rivers of 12b?</p>
<h3 id="viii6912">VIII.69.12</h3>
<p>I take sudevá- as a bahuvrīhi, as su-compounds with this metrical shape
and accentuation generally are (contra Ge’s “ein guter Gott”). The gods mentioned in
11b may be part of Varuṇa’s retinue.</p>
<h3 id="viii6913">VIII.69.13</h3>
<p>Interpretations of this verse vary, and cd is characterized as “dunkel” by
both Ge and Old. I take the verse as a series of relative clauses referring to
(unnamed) Indra, leading up to the proclamation of Indra in 14ab. The relative
clauses are interrupted by an exclamatory tád íd vápuḥ “just this is the marvel!” in c.
Ge takes takváḥ as a PN (rejected by Mayr. PN; see also EWA s.v. TAK), but
I see no reason to separate the stem from tákvan-, takva-vī́-, and takvavī́ya-, all of
which seem to refer to the movements of birds of prey.
I take upamā́(so Pp., or upamā́ḥ) in the same way as in I.31.15, viz., as a root
noun compound ‘measure’. See disc. there.</p>
<h3 id="viii6914">VIII.69.14</h3>
<p>Ge takes ohate as reflexive, but I prefer a passive interpretation here.
The second half of the verse segues into the Emuṣa myth prominent in this
part of VIII. For disc. see publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="viii6915">VIII.69.15</h3>
<p>Note the extreme diminutivization in arbhakó ná kumārakáḥ, signalled
by the two -ká-suffixed forms. Presumably the point, in this account of Boyhood
Deeds, is to emphasize how small and weak he was to accomplish such deeds.
Both Ge and Old are troubled by vibhukrátu- as a qualifier of the buffalo. Old
goes so far as to suggest it should be nominative, but was attracted into the
accusative by the preceding accusatives (which, note, are not even adjacent or in the
same pāda). This seems unlikely (and unworthy of the usually punctilious Old). Ge
also manoeuvres the adjective into referring not to the krátu- of the buffalo, but
rather to that of the father and mother: “Er kochte das Büffeltier für Vater und
Mutter, das ihrem Verlangen genügte.” I do not understand how he is interpreting the
vibhu-, nor do I see any difficulty with assigning the quality named in the compound
to the buffalo: that the buffalo is formidable makes the feat of a tiny boy cooking it
(and presumably first catching it) all the greater.</p>
<h3 id="viii6916">VIII.69.16</h3>
<p>The first hemistich seems addressed to the present-day Indra, recalling
his boyhood deeds recounted in 15ab.
The second half matches vs. 7, with the same proposition that Indra and I
(=poet, in my opinion; Ge rather Viṣṇu) should become comrades (both times with
sacevahi). The referent of the multiple accusatives in cde is disputed. Old suggests
the sun, in part because sahásrapād- is used of the sun already in AV VII.41.2. Ge
also considers the sun the referent of the accusatives in cd, “den himmlischen,
tausendstrahligen, rötlichen (Sūrya),” but separates those in e into a separate
constituent (as far as I can tell), “den fehlerlosen, zum Heile führenden (Weg) folgen,”
44
because pāda e is found in VI.51.16ab ápi pánthām aganmahi, svastigā́m anehásam
qualifying ‘path’. I prefer to read all the accusatives together and take the path (of
VI.51.16) as the referent. This also involves interpreting sahásrapādam as ‘having a
thousand steps’, not ‘… a thousand feet’. This recalls vs. 7 “… become comrades at
the seven(th) step…,” and I would suggest that the “thousand step” version plays off
the previous one, indicating that our comradeship will last even longer. The path
itself may be the soma (see disc. of 7) that facilitated the establishment of our
comradeship; see 7c.
VIII.69.17–18: Note the responsion of 17b … āsate# and 18d … āśata#.</p>
<h2 id="viii70-indra">VIII.70 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii702">VIII.70.2</h3>
<p>Pādas b and c are difficult. The superficially most natural interpretation is
to take the two together, as Ge does (“in dessen Hand … die gerngesehene Keule
gelegt ward…”; so also Old), but the putative verb in this relative clause, dhāyi in c,
is unaccented. If we take this lack of accent seriously, and I think we should, some
other solution has to be found for the relative clause in pāda b, a task made all the
more challenging by the disputed form vidhartári. This particular form appears twice
(also IX.47.4) and formally belongs to the agent noun vidhartár- (voc. sg. 1x, nom.
sg. 4x) ‘distributor, apportioner’. The -tári forms are nonetheless generally taken as
infinitives. Tichy (1995: 59–61), by contrast, takes them as loc. sg. of a verbal
abstract (here “in dessen Hand, wenn es ans Verteilen geht, ein weiteres Mal die
sehenswerte Keule gelegt wird” [p. 60]), and others take it as nom. sg. neut. (See disc.
of these various possibilities with earlier lit. in Old and in Keydana [Infin. 196–99].)
Keydana, at least for this verse, suggests that vidhartári is the (infinitival?) subject of
the nominal relative clause, yásya its specifier, and dvitā́a predicate adverb: “Der
Hand wurde die Keule dargereicht (pāda c), deren Austeilung ein weiteres Mal
[erfolgt] (pāda b)” (199 n. 31). I consider the form to be a locative (like Tichy), but a
locative not to an abstract but to the agent noun it appears to be and coreferential
with Indra in pāda a. Alternatively it could refer to a third party, who is responsible
for the return of Indra’s mace; this seems to be Old’s favored solution: “beim
(Welt)ordner,” who is responsible for equipping Indra with the mace. In the absence
of mythical context we cannot be certain. Though I have added the parenthetical “(in
the hand of),” this tr. is an English makeshift for the German bei or French chez,
which both render such locatives more efficiently. The statement in b, that the mace
has been returned to Indra, is then restated in pāda c more clearly.
The datives hástāya and divé instead of the locatives that might be expected
are curious.</p>
<h3 id="viii703">VIII.70.3</h3>
<p>The identity of “him” in “No one will catch up with him…” is not
sufficiently signalled in the publ. tr. I take it to refer to the successful sacrificer (cf.
VIII.31.17), who ritually strengthens and thus “has created” Indra. However, the
perfect cakā́ra could instead signal mythic time; both Ge and Old believe this refers
45
to the original creator of Indra, as in IV.17.4. The reference to Indra’s birth in 4cd
may support their position.</p>
<h3 id="viii704">VIII.70.4</h3>
<p>In my view this verse is structurally parallel to vs. 2: pāda a continues the
previous verse; b is a nominal relative clause; and cd may or may not go with b, but
have unaccented verbs. Ge (n. to 2b) and Old also consider the verses parallel, but in
the case of both verses they think that bc belong together despite the unaccented
verbs of c(d). In separating b and c here I must supply a noun with the fem.
adjectives mahī́r urujráyaḥ &ndash; and choose ‘waters’, since pl. ā́pas, apás is common
with mahī́ḥ; ‘rivers’ would also be possible, so Ge, who seems to take mahī́ḥ simply
as a designation of rivers (“die breitströmenden Flüsse”) without comment.</p>
<h3 id="viii705">VIII.70.5</h3>
<p>The conjoined NPs in ab display a neat chiasmus: dyā́vaḥ … śatáṃ, śatám
bhū́mīḥ. This may help account for the placement of the utá after the second term
(indeed after the entire second term: śatám bhū́mīr utá). Although XY utá structures
are by no means uncommon (see Klein DGRV I.344–53), they are considerably rarer
than the standard X utá Y type.
In cd there are two parallel nominal subjects, pl. sahásraṃ sū́ryāḥ and du.
ródasī, and neither matches the sg. verb ánu … aṣṭa in number. Several solutions
have been proposed. BR (see Old) and Gr take ródasī as singular, but all other
examples of sg. ródasī (and more common rodasī́) refer to the goddess of that name;
when ródasī refers to the world-halves, it is always dual. Old also cites Ge Komm for
the view that the sg. verb was influenced by sahásram. I am inclined to assume that
the sg. verb split the difference between the plural and dual subjects, and it is also
possible that the construction was somehow syntactically calqued on the inherited
neuter plural subject + singular verb construction (though neither of the subjects is
neuter). It’s also worth noting that the root aor. 3rd du. middle of √(n)aś is not
attested, and in fact, acdg. to Macdonell, Vedic Gr., the only 2nd or 3rd du. mid. root
aor. attested is adhītām (X.4.6, √dhā) &ndash; so the poet may have been a bit insecure
about what the du. form ought to be (*aśātām? *aṣṭāṃ?), and the pl. sū́ryāḥ may have
been too distant in the vs. to allow the 3rd pl. aśata to be used instead.</p>
<h3 id="viii706">VIII.70.6</h3>
<p>Ge takes the loc. gómati vrajé as a loc. absolute (“wenn es sich um
rindergefüllte Hürde handelt”). By using the Engl. idiom “help someone to
something” I may be stretching Sanskrit syntax further than is legitimate. Though see
Gr, definition 4 s.v. av: “jemandem [A.] wozu [D., L.] verhelfen.” Unfortunately this
is the only passage he places under that rubric with a loc.; the others have datives.
However, in Rivelex vol. I the Deep Case Frame for avi
, subsection 1d / 1da, tags a
number of other possible such passages with this structure (not all of which I would
so interpret).</p>

The second hemistich is unconnected to the first; its two rel. clauses attach to
the next verse.</p>
<h3 id="viii708">VIII.70.8</h3>
<p>Though as just noted, 7cd should be construed with this verse, the main
clause to which those rel. clauses should be attached is incomplete – having a
referent tám for the yáḥ of 7c, but no main verb. Ge supplies “rufet,” which seems
the simplest solution, extracted from the two forms of hávyaḥ in cd.
Gr, Ge take ā́raṇa- as ‘depths’, presumably as a contextual antonym to
gā́dha- ‘ford’, putatively &lt; *‘shallow’ (but see EWA s.v.). But there seems no good
reason to separate ā́raṇa- from áraṇa- ‘alien, foreign’ and its relatives, esp. since a
ford is a ‘shallow’ only indirectly. The other occurrence of ā́raṇa- (I.112.6) is not in
an antonymic context; Ge renders it “in der Grube” (pit), but there is no external
support for this tr.</p>
<h3 id="viii709">VIII.70.9</h3>
<p>The lexeme ud √mṛś is found only here in early Vedic, but like other
combinations of √mṛś ‘touch’ + preverb, it seems to have a slightly slangy sense. Gr
“jemand [A.] emporheben zu [D.],” but the sense of touch is lost. Ge “Streck fein
(die Hand) für uns aus,” which fails to render both the root meaning and the preverb.
My “shape us up” attempts to render both, with the sense “make us ready/worthy to
receive.” The insistent úd here, opening pādas a, c, and d, may be meant to contrast
with ní in the following verse (pādas b, d).
Note the alliteration: ab … mahé, mṛśasva … and esp. cd … mahyaí
maghavan magháttaye, … mahé# This is the culmination of a play on mah- and
magha- forms in the central part of the hymn: 6a mahinā́, 6c maghavan, 8a mahó
mahā́yyam.</p>
<h3 id="viii7010">VIII.70.10</h3>
<p>The lexeme ní √tṛp occurs only here (in all of Sanskrit, as far as I can
tell). I interpret the ní as reversing the meaning of the root verb, as sometimes
elsewhere (see Jamison 1983: 86 for some other examples) – hence ‘be unsatisfied’ &lt;
√tṛp ‘be satisfied’. Scar also seems to interpret the verb in this fashion (“… bist du
unzufrieden”), but does not comment on why. Gr ‘verzehren’ (consume), Old ‘sich
sättigen’. Since tṛmpáti is ordinarily construed with a genitive, I take tvānídaḥ as a
gen. sg., not acc. pl., as Gr and Ge take it. Scar allows either possibility, and Old
favors the gen. My interpretation is thus rather distinct from Ge’s “du hast deine
Schmäher satt” (have your fill of), though his also conveys a negative sense.
The girding motif of c must indicate some kind of preparation for battle, but
what exactly the equipment and procedure were is not clear.
I have, reluctantly, interpreted the injunctive śiśnathaḥ in d as an imperative,
as also in VIII.24.25. So also Ge in both passages. It would be possible here (less so
in VIII.24.25) to interpret it modally “you will jab down…” or even as a timeless
statement “you jab down…”

<h3 id="viii7011">VIII.70.11</h3>
<p>Ge takes the sváḥ sákhā to refer to the enemy’s comrade, but given the
dual dvandva voc. índrāparvatā (3x) “o Indra and Mountain,” it seems more likely to
be Indra’s. In those passages I take “mountain” as a designation of Indra’s mace.</p>

<p>See comment on 12. The thematic connection between the verses is
underscored by the presence of the verb ‘grab’ in each, but note that vs. 15, part of

belonging to a more popular level of language, has the younger √grah (-gṛ́hya).</p>

<p>I supply “we beseech” as the verb, from the twin pragātha vs. 13c īmahe,

kṣaítrāya sā́dhase has to be interpr. in connection with the cmpd. kṣetrasā́dhas- (III.8.7, VIII.31.14). Ge’s interp. “zur Schlichtung (des Streites) um ein Feld”
[for the settlement (of conflict) regarding a field] seems unnecessarily specific and
contextually unsupported.
VIII.72 Agni or Praise of Oblations

<p>asya could also refer to Manu’s companionship and be tr. “in his

<h3 id="viii723-1">VIII.72.3</h3>
<p>There are various ways to configure the places where “they seek.” I take
antár in a pregnant sense, referring to the interior of the subject; the search expands
to jáne, and finally to the place “beyond inspired thought” (paró manīṣayā). Since
this phrase is also found in V.17.2, the two words must go together, whatever they
are trying to convey.
48</p>
<h3 id="viii724-1">VIII.72.4</h3>
<p>atītape has been subject to a number of conflicting analyses (esp. passive
or transitive with unexpressed subj.), but all seem to start with a 3rd sg. with
anomalous ending -e. I see no reason why it cannot be a 1st sg., with the proper
ending for a thematic medial reduplicated aorist. Although there are no other 1st
singulars around, referents are ricocheting around everywhere in this hymn, and as
indicated in the publ. intro., the vss. do not show close connections to each other.</p>
<h3 id="viii726-1">VIII.72.6</h3>
<p>Gr. assigns dāmā́to an otherwise unattested long-ā́stem and glosses it as
‘Seil’, but it could just as well be the nom. sg. masc. to an -n-stem *dāmán- ‘binder’
formed to neut. dā́man- ‘bond’ (like m. brahmán- to neut. bráhman-).</p>
<h3 id="viii7211">VIII.72.11</h3>
<p>The hapax abhyā́ram is glossed by Gr “zur Hand, bereit,” and Ge and Re
follow suit. Old suggests that it’s an absolutive, without specifying to what root or
what it should mean. Still I think he has a better chance of being right than the others.
The -am gerund takes vṛddhi of the root and accent on the root syllable (see, e.g.,
Whitney Gr. §995, and AV abhyākrā́mam). This form could well belong to abhí √ṛ
(as in fact Gr also suggest) and mean ‘going towards’.</p>
<h3 id="viii7212">VIII.72.12</h3>
<p>The first pāda contains a lovely sound sequence: (g)ā́va
(up)āva(t)āva(tam).
The hapax rapsúdā is difficult. Ge refuses to tr.; Old suggests a connection
with the rare lapsudín- (TS, etc.) ‘having a beard’. Although the phonology would
obviously work, the semantic connection is shaky, and lapsudín- has no etymology
either. I favor a suggestion of Re’s, that the word here is connected with the
secondary root √rapś, extracted from virapśá- ‘abundance’, which in turn derives
from *vīra-p(a)śu-, by most lights (see comm. ad I.122.4). The first part of the word
(rapsú-) can be seen as preserving the -u-, which the other forms don’t, but losing
the ví (for which cf. rapśád-ūdhan- &lsquo;with teeming udders&rsquo; [II.34.5, of dhenus]). The
palatal sibilant cluster (-pś-) was also regularized to one containing the dental sibilant
(for possible parallel ex. see rāspiná- I.122.4, with metathesis as well). The second
part of the word would be the root noun to √dā ‘give’, in the nom. sg. fem., modified
by mahī́, indicating a vessel (perhaps ukhā́?). Although we should expect a nom. sg. -
dāḥ, the final may have been lost either because it was simply reanalyzed as a fem.
stem with suffixal -ā- or because it was lost in continuous recitation (before the
pāda-initial vowel of pāda c) and not restored redactionally.</p>

<p>The curious phrase “honed with hope” is probably motivated in part by the
phonological similarity in the Skt. āśásā# … aśāyata#. With Re (EVP XVI), I take
aśāyata here to the root √śā ‘whet, sharpen’, not √(n)aś as with the other forms with
the same apparent stem shape. See further ad VI.33.2.</p>
<h3 id="viii7311">VIII.73.11</h3>
<p>Some of the interpretive questions in this vs. are 1) whether kím is a neut.
interrog. pronoun (as I take it) or a question particle (so Ge), and 2) what the referent
of idám is. I supply ‘deed’, since that’s something regularly proclaimed. Ge and Re
assume the referent is ávaḥ ‘Gnade’/‘faveur’ from the refrain. Since the refrain
otherwise has no connection with the rest of the verse in this hymn, I think this
solution is unlikely, but I hold no particular brief for my ‘deed’.</p>

<p>Nom. pl. part. vājayántaḥ (b) and 1st sg. stuṣé (d) represents the not
unusual number mixture of a singular poet speaking for and with the other ritual
officiants. Cf. VIII.66.1 for similar number mismatch.
Pāda-final vácaḥ I take (with Ge) as a truncated instr. standing for vácasā. For
disc. see comm. ad VIII.39.2. However, in this context, since √stu can, though rarely,
take an acc. of the praise, it is possible (with Old and Re [though Re seems to recant
in his n.]) to take it as obj. of stuṣé in a construction different from the dominant
agním … stuṣé. However, the acc. of the god praised continues in the next two verses,
and I think it unlikely that this focus would be interrupted by “I speak a speech as
praise.”</p>

<p>The publ. tr. should read “Brilliant with its brilliance …” and “at the

<h3 id="viii7410">VIII.74.10</h3>
<p>The vs. is structured as an acc. phrase referring to Agni, with no
governing verb. It is probably best to take it as loosely anticipating the rel. clauses
beginning with yám in the other two verses of the tṛca (yáṃ tvā 11a, 12a). That the
accusatives in ab, d belong in a virtual rel. clause is signalled by pāda c with a rel.
clause in the gen. (yásya …).
My interpr. of pāda a differs from the standard, which takes -prā́- as ‘fill’ and
construes áśvam … gā́m as a simile: “filling the chariot [with goods, vel sim.] (as) a
50
horse (or) cow (does).” This conjures up an unintentionally comic picture in a
physical sense, and even in the attenuated sense this interpr. presumably sketches,
that a winning horse or productive cow generates goods that would fill a chariot (see
Ge’s n. 10a), the structure and meaning of the phrase are muddy. I follow a
suggestion of Re’s, given in his n. to the passage but not reflected in his tr., that the
sequence is a reduction of *aśvaprā́m íd goprā́ṃ rathaprā́m and that prā́- belongs
with forms like pūrdhí ‘give!’ (Mayrhofer’s PARI2
).
The u-present tū́rvatha here is enclosed by two occurrences of related (vṛtra-
)tū́rya- (9c, 12c) ‘overcoming of obstacles’, but though tū́rva- does on occasion take
an acc. of what is overcome (cf. the same VP in VIII.99.6 vṛtrám … tū́rvasi), here
“overcome (Agni’s) claims to fame” is excluded by sense, since the poets shouldn’t
seek to outdo Agni, and it must mean something like “help to triumph.”
In pāda d I supply *gṛṇánti as the verb with nom. kṛṣtáyaḥ on the basis of the
next hymn VIII.75.10 grṇ̥ ánti deva kr̥ṣṭáyaḥ (see also girā́in the next vs. of this
hymn, 11a). It is possible that this subj./verb complex governs the whole verse, save
for pāda c with its 2nd pl. verb and gen. rel. cl. &ndash; thus, “(whom) the separate peoples

<p>The hapax cániṣthad, though fairly clearly a 3rd sg. act. injunctive, is not
regularly formed. Whitney (Roots) calls it “plainly corrupt”; Old discusses it at some
length and floats various possibilities. Whatever its source, it clearly patterns with
the superlative cániṣṭhā in the same metrical position in 8b (so Old, Re). The
standard solution, which comes in various guises, has been to posit a more regularly
formed verb that has been re-formed (/corrupted) because of the proximity of the
splv., either at the time of composition or redactionally. This is the tack Old chooses;
of the various underlying possibilities he considers, he favors an -iṣ-aor. subjunctive
*cániṣat (cf. 2nd du. caniṣṭám). See also Hoffmann (MSS 2 [1952/1957] = Aufs. 367;
repeated by Narten, s-aor. 111), who considers the contamination a product of the
poet.</p>

<p>Although it might at first seem odd that Agni’s horses best summon the

<p>This is the only occurrence of śrád- outside the inherited univerbated
idiom śrád √dhā ‘trust/put trust in’. As I have discussed elsewhere, ‘trust’ is often
specifically trust in the efficacy of the sacrifice, and I think that’s the meaning being
tapped here: realize our trust in the sacrifice’s success with tangible results.</p>
<h3 id="viii753">VIII.75.3</h3>
<p>The pleonastically suffixed yáviṣṭhi
ya- beside the regular splv. yáviṣṭhaowes its suffix entirely to metrical considerations. All 15 occurrences of the stem are
pāda-final in a Jagatī or dimeter line and thus provide a text-book iambic cadence.
The unextended yáviṣṭha- is not as rigidly placed, but is still often pāda-final in a
Triṣṭubh cadence.</p>
<h3 id="viii755">VIII.75.5</h3>
<p>The standard tr. take tám as a ref. to Agni, who is then the equivalent in
the frame of nemím in the simile; so “bend him here as craftsmen bend a felly.” In
the publ. tr. I take the frame/simile relation to be an example of case disharmony,
with ā́namasva intransitive/reflexive in the frame (“bend (yourself) here”) and
transitive in the simile (“as craftsment bend a felly”). This is based in part on the fact
that medial forms of √nam (outside the 1st ps.) are intransitive, and this interpr. also
makes better sense of the voc. aṅgiraḥ: in the sg., áṅgiras- is used almost exclusively
of Agni and never, as far as I know, of a human poet/priest as it would be here if a
poet/priest is the subj. of ā́namasva. But I failed to remember that nemí- is said to be
feminine, and therefore tám should not qualify it. I am still unwilling to give up my
interpr., however, and would note first that at least in the RV there are no diagnostic
passages where nemí- must be feminine, that is, no passages containing unambiguous
feminine adjectives modifying it. And as a short -i-stem, it does not look feminine.
So I would claim either that it is being treated as a masc. in this passage or that
redactionally initial *tā́ṃ was changed to tám; there are no metrical implications.</p>

<p>Ge sees cows as the referent of the fem. bathers in b, which are, in his
interpr., leaving their calves behind as they bathe. Although I do not know about the
bathing habits of cows before modern animal husbandry (and Google is no help here),
I doubt that they abandoned their calves to go splash in the river &ndash; and I also doubt
that Ge knew much about this topic either. Moreover, having bathing cows
abandoning their calves in b and non-bathing cows doing the same in c seems
poetically clumsy. Rather I follow Re in taking the rosy bathers of b to be the dawns
(though he still sneaks in the cows in his tr. “vaches-aurores”). As he points out,
Dawn arises from her bath in V.80.5, and usrá- in the fem. pl. is regularly used of
dawns. I think there is a hint of coquetry and teasing here: a group of girls bathing in
a river, surprised by some young men, with the girls flashing a bit of skin and then
running off in fits of giggles. The girls-bathing motif is fairly widespread: the Gopis
and Kṛṣṇa come to mind, as well as Nausicaa and her friends in the Odyssey, and
nearer to home, the Apsarases engage in water play in X.95.7–9.

<p>The standard tr. take námaḥ as obj. of gṛṇánti and ab as a single clause

DAT is a well-represented construction.</p>
<h3 id="viii7511">VIII.75.11</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. “…you will toil for wealth for us, for our quest for cattle”
makes the two “for” phrases sound parallel, though they are not in Sanskrt (acc.
rayím, dat. gáviṣṭaye). The intent is that Agni should work hard to obtain wealth for
us, which we can use in our quest for cattle (that is, further wealth).

<p>This vs. relies on an untranslatable pun on the root √vṛj ‘twist’, in two

<h2 id="viii76-indra">VIII.76 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii761">VIII.76.1</h3>
<p>The position and function of ná in c are somewhat troubling. If, as seems
likely, it is the simile marker, its position should mark marútvantam as the simile
“like one accompanied by the Maruts,” but this makes no sense, since Indra’s being
accompanied by the Maruts for real is the insistent point of this hymn. It therefore
must be construed with the following infinitival vṛñjáse and have an “as if” sense (so
Ge), rather than participating in a strict simile structure. I attribute the flipping of the
word order to the fact that simile-marking ná seems to be blocked from pāda-final
position. See comm. ad X.21.1 and X.111.7. This phenomenon was already noted by
Ge; see his n. 4a to IV.27.4. The only counterexample I have found is VII.68.8 It
might also be possible to take vṛñjáse as a truncation of *párivṛñjase and the ná as
the negative, “for (him) not to avoid (us),” but there is no model for this nor any
reason to assume truncation.</p>
<h3 id="viii7612">VIII.76.12</h3>
<p>The last pāda presents some difficulties: the function of the ablative
índrāt, the syntactic affinity of pári (preverb with mame or postposition with índrāt?),
and the sense of tanvàm. Ge takes índrāt as an ablative of comparison (“habe ich im
Vergleich mit Indra zu klein bemessen”). His “zu klein” must render tanvàm, which I
assume he takes, with Gr, as belonging to an adj. tanú- ‘thin’ in the fem., rather than
to the fem. noun tanū́- ‘body, self’. But even if we were to accept this analysis of
tanvàm, it would still be a positive, not a comparative. It would be possible to take
pári as a postposition with índrāt in the meaning ‘from’, but despite the positioning I
53
am inclined to take it with the verb mame because pári √mā is found in a very
similar context in the riddle hymn, with numerology: I.164.45 catvā́ri vā́k párimitā
padā́ni “Speech is measured in four feet (/quarters).” As for tanvàm I take it as
referring to the “body” of the speech, perhaps the physical realization in sound
measured out in time. Scar (667) takes the tanvàm as reflexive: “Die … Rede …
habe ich von Indra ausgehend mir angemessen,” which seems to treat the form as a
dative. In n. 948 he does recognize the possibility that the poet sees his hymn as
“Corpus.” I take índrāt as abl. of cause, though it could be a simple starting point: “I
measure the speech (starting from) Indra.”</p>
<h2 id="viii77-indra">VIII.77 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii772">VIII.77.2</h3>
<p>For this verse cf. VIII.32.2, 26–27. Gr takes niṣṭúraḥ as nom. pl., and Ge
apparently follows this analysis, taking it as indicating the designated destroyers of
Indra (“Diese sollen &hellip; (deine) Niederstrecker sein”; sim. Scar 539, 642, though with
more machinery). But I consider it rather a gen. sg. modifying a gapped gen. sg.
referring to Indra – quite possibly by haplology from té *te. The only other
occurrence of the stem is in the dative and modifies Indra, in a verse immediately
following an Emuṣa verse: … ugrā́ya niṣṭúre “… to the strong one who lays low.”</p>
<h3 id="viii773">VIII.77.3</h3>
<p>Note both the phonological figure khé … khédayā and the etymological
figure akhidat … khédayā. The sense ‘hammered together’ attributed to sám …
akhidat may seem strange, given that √khid means something like ‘tear (out/apart)’. I
assume that the lexeme and sense here were generated acdg. to the common sám / ví
opposition to ví √khid ‘tear out/apart’, attested in AVP XVI.73.5 and KS XVII.15 as
well as Śāṅkh. Br. II.9.
VIII.77.4–6: The name índraḥ is identically positioned in all three verses of this tṛca,
at the beginning of the final pāda.</p>
<h3 id="viii774">VIII.77.4</h3>
<p>The hapax pratidhā́- is connected by Gr to √dhā ‘suck(le)’, presumably
because of the soma-drinking context. But I take it rather to √dhā ‘place’ (so also
Scar, though with different semantics). The lexeme práti √dhā means ‘set (an arrow
on a bow), aim’, and from ‘aim’ to ‘shot’ seems an easy semantic path. Consider also
English ‘shot’ for a quickly downed drink. That a bow and arrows figure in the
Emuṣa myth (see vss. 6–7) may support this derivation.
The other hapax in this verse, kāṇukā́is not so easily handled. All tr. and
comm. (including MM, EWA, s.v.) essentially give up. Gr calls it a “Beiwort zu
sáras-” (the ponds in pāda b) and takes it as an acc. pl. neut., which seems reasonable,
though it could also in principle be an old instr. sg. of an -a- or -ā-stem (as pratidhā́
is). Unlike some other passages containing opaque hapaxes, there is no phonological
motivation visible. It resembles the hapax participle kaṇūkayánt- in X.132.7, but that
is of no help because that form is even more puzzling than this one. It also resembles
kāṇá- ‘one-eyed (RV X.155.1, AV+), and Edgerton (1911, The -k-suffixes of Indo-
54
Iranian, 13) suggests it is derived from that word and means &lsquo;jug&rsquo; — a jug “with a
small opening and a large bulging body,” though he&rsquo;s not happy about the -u-. I have
also considered the possibility that it’s derived from a MIA form of kárṇa ‘ear’ and
also refers to a vessel for liquids, this time because of its earred handle(s). The Eng.
tr. ‘hogshead’ is an attempt to replicate the possible derivation of a word for liquid
measure from a word for a part of the head. A hogshead contains a prodigious
amount of liquid. One contributor to the word’s appearing here might be a pun on the
vṛddhi derivative kāṇvá- ‘descendant of Kaṇva’, which is several times read as
kāṇu
vá- (VIII.2.40, 4.20); the Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn to Kurusuti Kāṇva.
So, something like “(the vessels) of soma provided by the Kāṇvas.”</p>
<h3 id="viii775">VIII.77.5</h3>
<p>I have no idea who or what the Gandharva represents here. Ge suggests
that it can be the Gandharva as Somabewacher or, alternatively, the sun, but the
context gives no particular support to either identification. It would be desirable to
connect this verse with the Emuṣa myth, but I do not see how to do that either. It
should be noted, however, that the datival phrase brahmábhyaḥ … vṛdhé “to
strengthen the composers of sacred formulations” is reminiscent of the datival phrase
in vs. 8, an undoubted Emuṣa verse, stotṛ́bhyaḥ … nṛ́bhyo nā́ribhyo áttave “for the
praisers, the superior men and their ladies, to eat.” Note in our phrase the “attraction”
of the obj. brahmábhyaḥ into the dat. to match the inf. vṛdhé. Unless we wish to
interpr. the phrase as passive, “for the composers … to be strengthened.”
On the lexeme abhí √tṛd, see comm. ad IX.110.5. It is generally specialized
for the drilling into the cave in the Vala myth, but that seems to give us no help here.
The one clear connection to the Emuṣa myth within the hymn is the adj.
abudhná- ‘bottomless’, which anticipates the name of the bow, bundá-, in the next vs.</p>
<h3 id="viii776">VIII.77.6</h3>
<p>Ge takes bundám in c as the object of nír āvidhyat ‘pierced’ that opens the
verse. This requires assuming an aberrant meaning for the verb (‘abschiessen’
[shoot]), and I find it unlikely (so does Old, who also feels that the object should be
the target of the verb). Instead, though it requires supplying a first object for the verb
in a and a verb to govern the acc. in c, I take the three pādas as relatively
syntactically independent and supply the boar as one object of nír āvidhyat, in
addition to odanám in b. I take the first two pādas as shorthand for killed the boar,
pierced the mountain, and got the porridge – the three signature actions in the Emuṣa
story. Note that odanám is the object of bhinat ‘split’ in another condensed allusion
to the Emuṣa myth in VIII.69.14. As for what verb to supply to govern bundám, I
supply ‘took’ from yet another abbreviated version in VIII.45.4, the only other hymn
in which bundá- is found: ā́bundám … dade. For a possible long-distance
syntactic/formulaic relationship between 6a and 10d, see comments on vs. 10.
I take the phrase giríbhya ā́as expressing the freeing of the odanám from the
mountains (pāda b), but it could also be read with pāda a with the sense of ā́+ abl.
“all the way to,” though in that sense the ablative usually follows (see Gr s.v. ā́),
hence “He pierced the boar all the way to/through the mountains.”
55
As noted ad vs. 5, bundá- is reminiscent of (a)budhná- in the immediately
preceding mysterious Gandharva verse.</p>
<h3 id="viii777">VIII.77.7</h3>
<p>bradhná- is otherwise a color term (‘coppery, ruddy’) or a substance
characterized by that color (soma, in nearby VIII.69.7), but in this hapax bahuvrīhi,
śatá-bradhna- it must refer to something capable of being counted, hence my ‘ruddy
glints’. Gr’s ‘hundert Metallspitzen habend’, Ge’s ‘mit hundert Spitzen’ seem to
stray too far from the color term. The appearance of this word here may be owing to
its phonological similarity to bundá-.</p>
<h3 id="viii778">VIII.77.8</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., I take this verse as the speech of Indra’s
mother, picking up from the dialogue in vss. 1-2 that began (1a) jajñānó nú “just
born,” which is echoed here by sadyó jātáḥ (“just born right now”). In VIII.45.4
Indra took the Bunda bow just before his dialogue with his mother, and in
VIII.69.14-15 he&rsquo;s a tiny child when he gets the porridge and cooks the buffalo for
his mother and father.
I supply odanám ‘rice porridge’ as the object of ā́bhara (and áttave). Note
that in the summary verse 10 various foodstuffs, including odanám, are objects of
ā́bharat.
The inclusion of ‘ladies’ (nā́ribhyaḥ) alongside superior men (nṛ̥bhyaḥ) is
quite rare in the RV. See I.43.6, where it seems to refer to humankind in general.
Here it seems to have a more restricted sense and could actually refer to the gods and
their wives: nṛ́- is often used of divinities. For goddesses beside gods see nearby
VIII.80.10, though it is attributed to a different poet.
The voc. ṛbhuṣṭhira is a little surprising. Both Gr and Ge take it as implicitly
comparative: Gr ‘stark, tüchtig wie Ṛbhu’, Ge ‘… stark wie die Ṛbhu’s’. I take it
rather as parallel to ṛbhukṣán- ‘master of the Ṛbhus’, which is regularly an epithet of
Indra.
VIII.77.10–11: On these verses as possible explanatory additions to the Emuṣa
version given earlier in the hymn, see publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="viii7710">VIII.77.10</h3>
<p>Old and Ge (see his n. 10d) read loc. índre contra the Pp. nom. índraḥ
and interpret the verse as meaning that Viṣṇu brought Emuṣa to Indra, along with the
food named in pāda c. But this seems unlikely: the central fact of the myth is that
Indra pierced the boar. Cf. I.61.7d vídhyad varāháṃ tiró ádrim ástā “He pierced the
boar through the stone, (Indra) the archer.” This last pāda contains both Indra and the
boar and ends with the boar’s name as if as the solution of a riddle (remember that
this is the only occurrence of the name in the RV), and it would seem rhetorically
anticlimactic for the image merely to be one of Viṣṇu lugging the corpse of the boar,
along with some food, to Indra. Instead it seems the encapsulation of the myth, and I
would further argue that it finally closes the incomplete syntactic circle begun in
verse 6. In 6a we find nír āvidhyad giríbhya ā́“(he) pierced from/to/through the
mountains,” with the signature verb and the signature locale (see ádrim in I.61.7 just
56
quoted), but neither subject nor object. But in 10d we have both subject (reading nom.
índraḥ with the Pp.) and object, but no verb. This seems a clever variant on ring
composition, where a structure begun at the beginning of a section is completed at
the end. Even if, as I suggest in the intro., vs. 10 is a tacked-on addition to the
original Viṣṇu-less version of the myth found in the rest of this hymn (and other
mentions in VIII), the poet has cleverly made use of the underdefined treatment in 6a
to attach vs. 10 more closely to vss. 6–9 by supplying the missing pieces in 10d.</p>
<h3 id="viii7711">VIII.77.11</h3>
<p>sūmáya- is generally analyzed as having the adverbial prefix su- ‘good’,
hence ‘aus gutem Stoff’ (Ge). However, AiG II.2.770 reports a suggestion of
Thieme&rsquo;s (apparently only reported in AiG, not publ.) that it&rsquo;s ‘aus Eber(-zahn)
verfertigt’, with an unextended root noun sū- ‘(wild) pig, boar’, which is the basis of
sūkará- ‘boar’ (already RV VII.55.4) and which has numerous IE cognates.
Although Mayrhofer explicitly rejects this suggestion (KEWA, s.v. sūkará-; EWA,
s.vv. MAY1
, sūkará-), context favors Thieme’s suggestion. The boar Emuṣa was
clearly a formidable opponent of Indra’s, and the use of a weapon made from the
same animal to defeat it makes good sense from the point of view of sympathetic
magic. Consider also the association of boars with ritual of kingship, and note, in
particular, that using parts of the boar for the armor and weaponry of warriors is
found elsewhere (cf. Odysseus’s boar’s tusk helmet and the general disc. in Jamison
1999 [Penelope and the Pigs], ClAnt. 18: 258–70). The unextended root noun sūcould be preserved in this old myth, esp. since it could be assimilated to the prefix
su-.
My interpretation of pāda d essentially follows Scar (301, 516); see also EWA,
s.v. ARD.</p>
<h2 id="viii78-indra">VIII.78 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii781">VIII.78.1</h3>
<p>There seems no alternative to the problem posed by the ungoverned nouns
in pāda a than Ge’s – to supply a verb, probably a form of √juṣ ‘take pleasure’
(perhaps mid. part. juṣāṇáḥ). This verb seems particularly suitable since it can take
both acc. (puroḷā́śam) and gen. (ándhasaḥ). Ge, however, seems to be taking ándhasa
as a dative (ándhase), contra Pp.: “(Koste) unseren Reiskuchen zum Somatrank.”
The nominals in pāda a cannot be the object of ā́bhara because Indra doesn’t bring
the cake or the stalk, but enjoys them and brings objects in return to those who
provided them.</p>
<h3 id="viii783">VIII.78.3</h3>
<p>vaso is a predicated vocative; the tr. renders the predication rather than the
vocative, since the combination doesn’t work in Engl.</p>
<h3 id="viii784">VIII.78.4</h3>
<p>The first pāda is somewhat puzzling, though I may have made more of the
puzzles in the tr. than was necessary. The issue is the hapax vṛdhīká-. The standard tr.
and comm. take this, with the Pp., as nom. vṛdhīkáḥ and interpret it as an agent noun:
Ge, AiG II.2.428, EWA (s.v. VARDH), Scar (211, 584) ‘Bereicherer’ (though cf. Gr
57
‘gewachsen’), parallel to the nominatives in b and c. But uncompounded -īká-stems
are often neuters and sometimes used in the loc., which would be possible here
(vṛdhīké), contra Pp. Cf. VIII.48.12 mṛḷīké asya sumataú syāma “May we be in his
mercy and good grace.” I was also troubled by three other facts: 1) Taking the whole
verse as a single clause, as Ge does, runs into the problem that te in pāda a is
coreferential with tvát in c, and the two pronouns should, in my opinion, have two
different functions. (Ge, n., says te is pleonastic.) 2) I would prefer that nákīm (a) and
nā́nyáḥ (c) not simply be conflated, as Ge seems to do. 3) The next verse also begins
with nákīm (the only two occurrences of this form in the RV), which is followed by a
nominal in an oblique case, in that case a datival infinitive níkartave (and its parallel
in b, páriśaktave), and I would prefer that 4a have a structure that at least also
involves an oblique case. A similar impulse may account for Re’s apparent
derivation of vṛdhīká- from the infinitive *vṛdhé, as reported in AiG II.2.418 (BSL
38: 80 n. 1 [“Infinitifs et dérivés nominaux dans le Ṛgveda”]). Putting all this
together, I take vṛdhīka as loc. vṛdhīké, somewhat in the sense of mṛḷīké in the
passage quoted above (“in the sphere of your increase,” that is, in the abundance of
your giving), with te dependent on it. However, on re-examination of the passage I
think I may have overthought it, and an interpretation more like Ge/Scar may be less
fussy – though the reservations expressed above remain. I must also admit that my
publ. tr. requires anyáḥ of c to be read also with a.</p>
<h3 id="viii787">VIII.78.7</h3>
<p>I consider the genitives in pāda b, turásya … vidhatáḥ to modify Indra,
whereas Ge takes them with the ‘resolve’ (krátvaḥ), which he considers to be the
soma, of pāda a. The problem, in his view, is that vidhánt- doesn’t easily qualify
Indra (turá- regularly does), but since the root √vidh ‘honor’ is an old derivative of
ví √dhā ‘apportion’, taking it in its etymological sense allows it to modify the god.</p>
<h2 id="viii79-soma">VIII.79 Soma</h2>
<h3 id="viii791">VIII.79.1</h3>
<p>Both kṛtnú- and udbhíd- appear to be gambling terms here. For kṛtnú- in a
gambling context see I.92.10, for udbhíd- X.116.9. udbhíd- means literally
‘bursting/breaking out [/up]’. The semantic development may be something like
“break out of the pack / burst to the finish.” viśvajít- ‘all-conquering’ can also fit the
gambling scenario, as, arguably, can ágṛbhīta- ‘ungraspable’ &ndash; that is, who is too far
ahead to be caught or caught up to. The hymn is ascribed to Kṛtnu Bhārgava;
Bhārgava is of course a fairly common patronymic, but Kṛtnu appears only here,
clearly lifted from the hymn’s first pāda.
The final pāda consists entirely of the three most resonant words for
poet/poetic activity: ṛ́ṣi- ‘seer’, vípra- ‘inspired poet’, kā́vya- (standing for kaví-
‘sage poet’). The juxtaposition of the gambling focus of the first two pādas with the
poetic lexicon of the last is striking, but sets the tone for the rest of the hymn, which
catalogues the variety of Soma’s skills.

<h3 id="viii792">VIII.79.2</h3>
<p>In c īm seems functionless. Though technically it could serve as object to
prá … khyat (“the blind man sees it/them”), it is much more likely that the verb is
used in absolute function, to indicate the blind man’s recovery of his vision, not his
sight of some particular (but unspecified) object(s). Vs. 6c also begins prém a-VOWEL,
though there the īm could double the object ā́yuḥ. However, in both cases I think īm
is simply introduced to avoid hiatus.</p>
<h3 id="viii793">VIII.79.3</h3>
<p>By my interpr. (and Ge’s), pādas ab contain a series of adjacent -bhyaḥ
plural nominals, which by sense must be sorted into dative pl. tanūkṛ́dbhyaḥ (“for the
body-makers”) and ablative pl. dvéṣobhyo anyákṛtebhyaḥ (“from hateful things done
by others”). The pāda break assists in splitting up these formally identical forms. A
different interpr., going back to the MS (see Ge’s n. 3a) and followed by Re,
however, takes tanūkṛ́d- in passive sense ‘done by oneself’ and contrastively parallel
to anyákṛta- ‘done by others’; in this case, tanūkṛ́dbhyaḥ is also ablative. The
deliberate contrast between the root noun -kṛ́t- in the first compound and the past
passive participle -kṛta- in the second and the usual active, transitive sense of -kṛ́t- in
compounds (including the other occurrence of tanūkṛ́t-) make this interpr. unlikely.
See Old for disc.; he opts for the active sense, but considers the tanū- in question to
belong to the doers/makers referred to by -kṛ́t-: “(den Frommen), die tätig sind sich
die eigne tanū́zu schaffen.” (Scar weakly favors this.) This seems unnecessarily
complex, though the usual polarity between tanū- ‘self’ and anyá- ‘other’ is an
argument in its favor.</p>
<h3 id="viii794">VIII.79.4</h3>
<p>This vs. flips the syntactic roles found in the preceding vs. In 3 Soma
produces a defense (acc.) from (abl.) hateful things (dvéṣobhyaḥ); here he keeps the
hateful thing (dvéṣaḥ, acc.) from (abl.) the entities protected (heaven and earth). The
producer of the hateful thing is in the gen. (aghásya), whereas in 3b he (/they) were
the first member of a compound, anyá(-kṛta-).</p>
<h3 id="viii795">VIII.79.5</h3>
<p>The most difficult verse in the hymn by far and perhaps not accidently the
middle verse. It is striking among other things for its use of indicative (yánti),
subjunctive (gáchān), and optative (vavṛjyuḥ) in the same sentence, and for the
juxtaposition of the two roots √i and √gam with the same subject in an if-then
construction. For the latter, see Re’s disc.: he suggests persuasively that √i with acc.
indicates the goal towards which one is proceeding, but √gam with acc. the
attainment of the goal, though I am not at all sure this functional division holds
throughout the uses of these presents in the RV.
I interpr. the verse within Ge’s general scheme: that the subject throughout is
the soma priests and the thirsting man (tṛ́ṣyataḥ) of c is a competing priest &ndash; or at
least someone who covets the largesse of the giver (dadúṣaḥ) in b that rightly
belongs to the hard-working priests named in a (arthínaḥ).
The sense of the pf. opt. vavṛjyuḥ in c is a bit difficult to grasp, primarily
because the root √vṛj ‘twist’, etc., so seldom appears without a preverb. I think
‘deflect’ or ‘thwart’ is what is intended. As usual, I do not think that the fact that the
59
optative is built to the perfect stem adds any particular “perfect” nuance, though I do
have to admit in this case that there are optative forms built to another tense/aspect
stem, namely the root aor. (vṛjyām 1x, vṛjyās 3x, vṛjyā́ma 1x), all in the idiom with
pári.</p>
<h3 id="viii797">VIII.79.7</h3>
<p>With Gr I take avātá- as the negated ppl. of √vā ‘become extinguished’, in
the sense ‘unextinguishable, unquenchable’, also in I.38.7, 52.4, and 62.10. It is
separate from the homonymous avātá- ‘without wind, windless’ in VI.64.4 and
X.129.2 and also from differently accented ávāta- (√van ‘win’) ‘unvanquished’. Ge
takes the avātá- forms here and in I.38.7 as ‘windless’ (as well as those in VI.64.4
and X.129.2) and in I.52.4 and 62.10 as ‘unvanquishable’. Re takes this occurrence
as ‘invincible’; see his disc. ad loc. My interpr. rests partly on semantic, partly on
formal grounds. On the one hand, “windless Soma” (or, as Ge has it, “ohne Wind zu
machen”) makes no sense to me; on the other, though ‘invincible’ does make sense, I
prefer to respect the accent otherwise found with that form, noting also that
occurrences of that stem almost always appear with the participle vanván belonging
to the same root. As for the occurrences in Maṇḍala I, avātá- once modifies mist
(míh- I.38.2), once ‘streams’ (avánīḥ I.62.10, with phonological play), and once
Indra’s śúṣmāḥ (I.52.4, there tr. ‘gusts’). In all cases (even, or esp., the last) ‘windless’
does not work; the point in all three cases is, I think, that the entity does not “go out”
&ndash; dissipate or disappear. Exactly how this applies to Soma here is less clear, but I
assume that the point is that Soma is reliably present and available.</p>
<h3 id="viii799">VIII.79.9</h3>
<p>Ge’s tr. is very different: he takes áva not as a preverb in tmesis but as the
2nd sg. impv. to √av ‘help’ and ī́kṣe as the 2nd sg. med. pres. to √īś ‘be master of’
rather than the 1st sg. to √īkṣ ‘see’, hence “Hilf … wenn du … vermagst.” His n. 9ab
allows for the possibility of the other tr., however &ndash; the interpr. favored by Old and
found in Re and in the publ. tr.</p>
<h2 id="viii80-indra">VIII.80 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii801">VIII.80.1</h3>
<p>The particle báḍ seems to mean ‘in truth, for certain, yes indeed’ and,
despite appearances, may have Avestan cognates. baḷā́here is clearly based on it.
Hoffmann (Aufs. II.355) takes the expression here as a kind of internal quotation:
“nicht habe ich ja zu einem anderen gesagt: báḍ, du bist ein Erbarmer,” though the
direct speech is only represented by the particle and then only indirectly. My tr. is an
attempt to capture Hoffmann’s sense while sticking closer to the grammar.</p>
<h3 id="viii802">VIII.80.2</h3>
<p>Ge takes b in semi-independence of a: “… für die Lohngewinnung nicht
gering zu schätzen.” This seems to be because of VII.67.5, which, however, doesn&rsquo;t
seem to be parallel enough to require this interpretation here.
Note the phonological similarity of the value-heavy words marḍitā́ram (1b),
mṛḷaya (1c, 2c), belonging to √mṛḍ ‘have mercy’, and ámṛdhraḥ ‘not shirking, not
neglectful’.
60</p>
<h3 id="viii803">VIII.80.3</h3>
<p>Ge takes c as a statement “Gewiss wirst du, Indra, es für uns doch möglich
machen,” while I think it continues the questions of ab. The status of kuvíd clauses is
somewhat murky, in that kuvíd is clearly built to an interrogative stem, but it also
generally conditions accent on the verb (as here, śákaḥ) giving it also the appearance
of a subordinator. See Delbrück (AiS 550–51), Hettrich (Hypotaxe, 142–55), Etter
(Fragesätze, 219–30). An interpretation, like Etter’s, that kuvíd marks an implicit
indirect question such as “is it not the case that…?” seeks to capture these two
somewhat contradictory features of the particle’s syntax, though a full rendering of
this in tr. is often too heavy (as it would be here). For further on kuvíd and verbal
accentuation see comm. ad II.35.1.</p>
<h3 id="viii805">VIII.80.5</h3>
<p>The emphatic interjection hánta is presumably originally the 2nd pl.
imperative to √han ‘smite’ (flg. Thieme, Fremdl. 2–3, though EWA s.v. expresses
doubts) with full-grade root – hence my tr. ‘blast it!’ It occurs only 3x in the RV, the
other two in X, in direct speech contexts and in hymns identified by Arnold (Ved.
Metre) as popular. Here it continues the slangy tone set by baḍā́(1) and the questions
in 3.
Ge supplies a verb in c: “(uns bring) … Ruhm,” while I take the acc. neuter
phrase there as a loose goal: “put … first for … fame.” Note that the vājayú
qualifying śrávaḥ reappears in the next verse as a masc. modifying rátham.</p>
<h3 id="viii806">VIII.80.6</h3>
<p>The abrupt commands and almost insolent asides addressed to the great
god continue the tone established in the earlier verses. Again the tr. is meant to
capture this tone.</p>
<h3 id="viii807-1">VIII.80.7</h3>
<p>A clever image that modulates from b to c. In b a lucky female is going to
an assignation with Indra, playing on Indra’s known character as a hyper-virile
pursuer of women. But in c this female is identified as a dhī́- a visionary thought
(embodied as a poem), a word that is of course feminine. The adj. ṛtvíyāvatī is
suitable for both the woman in b (‘conforming to her menstrual cycle’) and the poem
in c (‘comforming to the ritual sequence’). This adjective is also found at VIII.12.10
with the same double application (though with dhītí- rather than dhī́-).</p>
<h3 id="viii808">VIII.80.8</h3>
<p>The referent of sīm in pāda a is not made clear, and the fact that sīm can
stand for all genders and numbers doesn’t help. Given the racing theme of b (and in
my interpretation c), I assume that it is our chariot, about which we have been
worrying previously (vss. 4–6), though it could possibly be the dhī́- of the
immediately preceding verse.
The lexeme apa-ā́√vṛj is attested only here, and the interpretation of the pāda
is made more difficult by the noun to which it is applied, aratní-, lit. ‘elbow’, but
potentially also ‘corner’ or ‘barrier’ (Schranken, see Old and Ge n.) or a unit of
measure (like Engl. ell). I take it to be the body part (as does Ge tr.) and interpret it
61
as a driving posture, with elbows turned out, indicating that the chariot racers are
ready to start. For other suggestions see Ge n. and Old.</p>

<p>The apparent etymological play between ‘handful’ and ‘hand’ is
unfortunately only found in the English: ‘handful’ is grābhám, ‘hand’ is (mahā)hastī́.
The phraseology seems to belong to dicing; see Lüders (Würfelspiel, 49–50). though
curiously Falk (Bruderschaft u. Würfelspiel) does not discuss this passage. See also

<h3 id="viii812-1">VIII.81.2</h3>
<p>Despite Ge’s appealing “an Gnaden Reichbemessenen” for tuvimātrám
ávobhiḥ, tuvimātrá- is a bahuvrīhi built to mā́trā- ‘mass, size’, with accent shift to
final syllable (see AiG II.1.297). Ge’s tr. also breaks the pattern of tuvi- compounds.</p>

<p>On the accent on stávāma see disc. ad VIII.29.14.</p>
<h3 id="viii815-1">VIII.81.5</h3>
<p>Ge suggests that the verbs in pāda a (prá stoṣat and úpa gāsiṣat
respectively) show that Indra is acting as Prastotar (the first assistant to the Udgātar,
responsible for chanting the prastāva) and Upagātar (subordinate chanter, at least
four of whom sing &ldquo;ho&rdquo; continuously in a low tone), priestly titles not found in the
ṚV, though their functions may be. Both roles would connect him with the Sāma
Veda, as does his listening to the sāman in pāda b. Old thinks rather that the priest is
the subject of pāda a, but this seems unlikely in this strong Indra context.</p>
<h3 id="viii816">VIII.81.6</h3>
<p>The verbs ā́√bhṛ and (abhí) prá √mṛś are also paired in VIII.21.16 drḍ̥ hā

<h3 id="viii818-1">VIII.81.8</h3>
<p>I make sánitvaḥ the predicate of a main clause (b) on which the relative
clause (a) is dependent, because I am reluctant to take ásti as a mere auxiliary with
the gerundive. This requires taking c as a separate sentence. Ge takes ab as a single
dependent clause, with c as the main clause.</p>
<h3 id="viii819-1">VIII.81.9</h3>
<p>Ge, Mayr (PN), followed by Klein (DGRV I.104) and Scar (175), take
váśaiḥ as a PN (“by the Vaśas”). This is possible but not necessary; as Ge (n.) reports,
Sāy takes it in its usual sense, as I do.
The verb jarante is taken by Gotō (150) to ‘awaken’, an interpretation I
follow. Although the notion of prizes “awakening” may seem strange, since the
Dakṣiṇā is distributed at the dawn sacrifice, it makes ritual sense. Others (Ge, Klein,
Scar) take it rather to ‘sing’, but this requires the form to be passive (Klein “and in
the morning are sung of by the Vaśas”; Ge’s tr. is actually a “‘Kompromiss’-
62
Übersetzung,” in Gotō’s phrase [150 n. 226] “… werden … wachgesungen,”
incorporating both ‘wake’ and ‘sing’, but still as a passive). However, járate ‘sing’ is
always active in value.
I take ca in c as inverse “X ca Y” connecting the two adverbials; Ge, Klein as
connecting the two clauses, ab and c.</p>
<h2 id="viii82-indra">VIII.82 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii824">VIII.82.4</h3>
<p>The ca in b is baffling both as to position and function. Ge seems to take it
as conjoining the imperatival clause in a with the present indicative clause in b
(“Komm … und du wirst … gerufen…”); Klein (DGRV I.233) is disturbed by the
“illocutionary difference” between the moods of the two clauses and suggests,
“Perhaps the particle is merely a weak, untranslatable transitional element,” which,
I’m afraid, is no help at all. Even if it is supposed to be conjoining the clauses, it is
positioned wrong for this function. My instinct is that, in this hymn built of clichés, ́
we are dealing with a truncated formula: X ukthā́(ni) ca (“X and hymns”). Cf.</p>
<h3 id="viii230">VIII.2.30</h3>
<p>gíraś ca … ukthā́ca, VIII.33.13 bráhmokthā́ca &hellip; (and the converse</p>
<h3 id="viii632-1">VIII.63.2</h3>
<p>ukthā́bráhma ca), as well as the overfull VI.38.4 bráhma gíra ukthā́ca
mánma. Note that VIII.1.1 múhur ukthā́ca śaṃsata also contains ukthā́ca with ca in
the wrong position and not clearly conjoining anything, though there it is easier to
interpret it as conjoining two modally harmonious clauses.
VIII.82.4–5: (ní) … hūyase (4b) and (prá) … hūyate (5c), though built to identical
stems, belong to the roots √hvā/hū ‘call’ and √hu ‘pour’ respectively.</p>

<p>viṣpitá- occurs only twice in Skt., here and in VII.60.7. In both
occurrences it is the obj. of √pṛ ‘carry across, deliver’, and in both cases there is
watery/nautical imagery. Its general value is clear &ndash; a danger that is conceptually
like a perilous water crossing &ndash; but it has no good etymology. See EWA s.v.</p>
<h3 id="viii835">VIII.83.5</h3>
<p>Pādas ab appear to be a single clause with the middle part. ī́śānāsaḥ
predicated to function as main verb. [Note in passing that Aufr’s typo ī́śānāśo with
palatal, pointed out by Old, has been taken over uncorrected into the HvN text.]
My tr. of c roughly follows Ge’s, though I have rendered īm (“it”). He
supplies a form of √naś ‘reach’, on the basis of VIII.47.1 … ném aghám naśat “evil
will not reach him.” I am hesitant about this interpr. because it requires supplying a
main verb with no support in context, but I don’t see a viable alternative. Re takes c
as contrastive with ab, with aghásya parallel to vāmásya (“vous êtes&hellip;les régisseurs
de la grace / non point &hellip; ceux du maléfice”), but he doesn’t explain the syntax, esp.
what he does with yát, which certainly shouldn’t represent his “ceux.”

<h3 id="viii839">VIII.83.9</h3>
<p>I do not understand the position of utá here. Although Klein cites this
passage several times, he doesn’t comment on the position of utá except implicitly,
by pointing to its interaction with ádhā (DGRV II.97–98).</p>
<h2 id="viii84-agni">VIII.84 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="viii841">VIII.84.1</h3>
<p>I take védyam to √vid ‘find, acquire’ rather than √vid ‘know’, contra the
standard view. I think it more likely that Vedic people (read, men) wanted to get a
chariot rather than just know about it, and the renderings of the adj. show translators’
discomfort with the root assignment: Ge “wie ein Streitwagen denkwürdig,” Re
“reconnaissable comme un char,” Klein (DGRV II.122) “conspicuous like a chariot.”
None of these senses is really proper to √vid ‘know’. For the image, see II.2.3 and
VIII.19.8.</p>
<h3 id="viii842">VIII.84.2</h3>
<p>According to Ge (probably correctly), this vs. refers to Agni’s flight and
subsequent discovery and reinstallation by the gods.</p>
<h3 id="viii844">VIII.84.4</h3>
<p>This vs. lacks a verb to govern úpastutim. I supply a form of (prá) √bhṛ
‘present, bring’, which takes úpastutim as object elsewhere (+prá IV.56.5, VIII.62.1;
simplex I.148.2). There is, unfortunately, no contextual support for it within the
hymn, however. Ge supplies ‘make’, which is not impossible but has no contextual
support, and the putative VP úpastutim √kṛ is not otherwise found. Re’s tr.
“(présenter)” seems to agree with mine, but in his n. he claims to be supplying vocaḥ
on the basis of vs. 5 (where the form is actually, per Pp [and most tr., incl. Re] voce).
Although this contextual support would be good to have, oddly enough no verbs of
speaking take úpastuti- as obj. (and, as just noted, Re’s tr. doesn’t reflect his
statement in the n.).</p>
<h3 id="viii847">VIII.84.7</h3>
<p>The standard tr. take párīṇasaḥ as a partitive abl. (“from whose profusion
do you quicken the thoughts”). My interpr. (“in profusion”) could support an
adverbial ablative of this neut. noun, but I think it’s also possible that párīṇas- was
reinterpr. as an adjective, on the basis of expressions like rāyā́párīṇasā (4x),
originally appositives (“with wealth, with profusion”), but reanalyzable as noun-adj.
“with abundant wealth” by way of noun+instr. adv. “with wealth in profusion.” If
párīṇasaḥ is an adjective, it can be an acc. pl. fem. agreeing with dhíyaḥ.
Contra the standard interpr., I do not take yásya te as coreferential, but
interpret yásya as coreferential with kásya in the main clause and take te separately
as either dat. or gen. My supplied “(presented)” is just there for ease of English
parsing: pāda c is easily interpretable as a nominal clause, “(the man) whose hymns
are for you at …” / “… whose hymns are yours …”</p>
<h3 id="viii848">VIII.84.8</h3>
<p>The small interpretive issue in this verse is who is the referent of svéṣu.
Ge/Re take it as Agni, while I think it’s the unidentified pl. subjects of marjayanta,
64
presumably the priests (so also Scar 417). An argument for my position might be the
fact that we might expect the reflexive adjective to be controlled by the syntactic
subject, but it is my sense that this is not a hard and fast rulem in Rigvedic syntax.
More to the point, in my opinion, is that 6ab … káro, víśvā asmábhyaṃ sukṣitī́ḥ “…
you will make all dwellings lovely for us” and 9a kṣéti kṣémebhiḥ “he [=the favored
mortal] dwells peacefully in peaceful ways …” associate dwellings with the mortal
worshipers.</p>

<h3 id="viii862">VIII.86.2</h3>
<p>The danger of imposing an after-the-fact narrative explanation onto a
RVic hymn is shown by Ge’s tr. of vímanāḥ here as “Betrübte” (distressed, afflicted).
Although a negative reading of this compound is possible (“without a mind, with a
mind [gone] away”), the only other occurrence of the word in the RV (X.82.2) is as a
positive attribute of Viśvakarman, “vast in mind.” There is no reason that this sense
cannot be found here as well; the next pāda states that the Aśvins gave him insight
(dhíyam), and the question in our pāda &ndash; how (kathā́) to praise the Aśvins &ndash; need not
be “how can someone with a disordered mind manage to praise them?” but rather
“which of the many possible ways should someone with a capacious mind choose for
praising them?” The questions in VIII.84.4–7, a hymn that belongs with ours though
the Anukramaṇī attributes them to different poets (see remarks before VIII.81 in the
publ. tr.), are similar.</p>
<h3 id="viii863">VIII.86.3</h3>
<p>The thematic connection between VIII.84 and our hymn suggested ad vs. 2
continues here: edhatú- ‘radiance’, only here in the RV, echoes edhate in VIII.84.9,
which characterizes the successful devotee of Agni &ndash; there tr. ‘thrives’, though
‘blazes brightly’ or sim. would be more vivid and literal.</p>
<h3 id="viii864">VIII.86.4</h3>
<p>Though Ge identifies the vīrá- ‘hero’ as Viṣṇāpu, as Re points out ṛjīṣín-
‘possessing the silvery drink’ is almost exclusively used of Indra (and never of
humans), and we are more likely to call upon this god than upon a rather vaguely
defined mortal.
65</p>
<h3 id="viii865">VIII.86.5</h3>
<p>What the truth is doing here insistently in this final verse isn’t clear to me.
As Re points out, though the rare verb śamāyá- is derived from the root √śam
‘labor’ (presumably as a deverbative from a 9th-class *śaṃnā́ti [see, perhaps,
ścamnan I.104.2]), it participates in a secondary word play between śáma- ‘hornless’
(I.32.15, 33.15) and śṛ́ṅga- ‘horn’ &ndash; hence the rather surprising appearance of the
enigmatic “horn of truth” in b.</p>
<h2 id="viii87-aśvins">VIII.87 Aśvins</h2>
<h3 id="viii871">VIII.87.1</h3>
<p>On the difficult word krívi-, see comm. ad I.30.1. Though krívi- is found in
a discouraging variety of contexts, our passage is similar to I.30.1, in that the root
√sic ‘pour’ is associated with it.
This verse modulates rather cleverly from praise for the Aśvins (stómaḥ, pāda
a) to pressed soma for them (mádhvaḥ sutásya, pāda c), pivoting on séke ‘at its
outpouring’, which is literally applicable to the soma but, as is well known,
metaphorically applicable to the praise.
VIII.87.1–2: The d pādas of these two vss. apparently begin with the same verb: 1d
pātám, 2d ní pātam, but these two almost certainly belong to the two homonymous
roots √pā ‘drink’ and √pā ‘protect’ respectively, pace Ge. Re’s arg. that the latter
belongs to ‘protect’ seems pretty decisive: ni √pā ‘drink’ is not found till the Rām.,
whereas ní √pā ‘protect’ is quite well attested in the RV. I imagine the poet signaled
the change of root by including this preverb while enjoying the etymological play
(see also píbatam beginning 2a, 4a, as well as pātam 5d).</p>
<h3 id="viii876">VIII.87.6</h3>

<p>Pāda c can be subordinate either to ab or to d; Ge chooses the former, I the
latter, but there are no implications either way.</p>
<h3 id="viii884">VIII.88.4</h3>
<p>I construe asi in a with abhí in b and take yóddhā as part of the subject
phrase, not predicated. Contra Ge, I also separate majmánā in b from the
instrumentals in a, krátvā śávasotá daṃsánā, on the basis of both the pāda break and
the position of utá. (Klein I.229 follows Ge by including majmánā in the conjoined
NP, but three pages later [232] this NP is cited with only the first three members.)
VIII.100.4b gives support to both of my decisions: víśvā jātā́ni abhy àsmi mahnā́,
with the finite form of √as adjacent to the preverb and a single instr. construed with
this verb. See also in the immediately following hymn VIII.89.6 tád víśvam abhibhū́r
asi, yáj jātáṃ yác ca jántvam.

<h2 id="viii89-indra">VIII.89 Indra</h2>
<p>As was noted in the publ. intro., every verse in this hymn, except the two
anuṣṭubhs (5–6), has a form of bṛhánt- in it: 1a bṛhát, 2c bṛ́hadbhāno, 3a brhaté, ̥ 4b
brhát ̥ , 7d brhát ̥ . The meters of these verses are bṛhatī or satobṛhatī. There is also
some transformational phonological play based on this word: 2b bhavat, 2d -bhāno,
3b bráhma, 4a bhara.</p>
<h3 id="viii891">VIII.89.1</h3>
<p>A neuter word for a verbal product needs to be supplied with bṛhát in a;
Ge suggests either bráhma (from 3b) or sā́ma (after Sāy). The latter is more likely,
since sāmans are sung (cf. VIII.98.1 índrāya sā́ma gāyata, which is almost identical
to our pāda), and since loc. sā́man is found in the last verse, 7c, it produces an
implicit ring.</p>
<h3 id="viii892">VIII.89.2</h3>
<p>The tr. of pāda a is meant to capture the etymological figure abhíśastīr
aśastihā́.
I take the verb ā́bhavat as the predicate, rather than as an auxiliary with
predicated dyumnī́as Ge does (“Indra bleib der Glanzreiche”).</p>
<h3 id="viii893">VIII.89.3</h3>
<p>Note bṛhád índrāya of 1a has been transformed into … índrāya bṛhaté,
with the adj. now qualifying Indra.
VIII.89.4–5: jā́yathā(ḥ) in 5a echoes jáyā(ḥ) in the immediately preceding pāda (4d),
though they belong to entirely different roots.</p>
<h3 id="viii894">VIII.89.4</h3>
<p>Ge’s suggestion (n.) that this verse constitutes the Maruts’ direct speech to
Indra is a persuasive one.</p>
<h3 id="viii896">VIII.89.6</h3>
<p>Ge takes háskṛti- as qualifying the ritual fire – again a good suggestion.
The fire’s crackling is the “laughter.” Unfortunately Ge bleaches the metaphor, tr.
“der helle Schein (des Opferfeuers),” which substitutes an unremarkable visual
image for the striking auditory one.</p>
<h2 id="viii90-indra">VIII.90 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii901">VIII.90.1</h3>
<p>Ge takes the loc. phrase víśvāsu … samátsu with hávyaḥ and construes
bhūṣatu in b with the accusatives in c. This is certainly possible and this disposition
of the loc. may make better, or smoother, sense. However, because of the verse
structure, I would prefer to keep bhūṣatu interpretationally in the first hemistich, and

attracted to the fem. sg. simile.

<h3 id="viii912">VIII.91.2</h3>
<p>Narten (Yasna Haptaŋhaiti, 146 and n. 45) identifies vīraká- as a word
belonging to women’s language (Frauensprache) and thinks it should be tr. “mein
lieber Held” rather than “Männlein.” But I don&rsquo;t see why the diminutive of affection
can&rsquo;t be an element here; Apālā is also trying to domesticate him and make him more
approachable.
The substances Apālā offers to Indra to accompany the soma form a ritually
defined group of offerings elsewhere (III.52.1), the Savanīya-puroḍāśa-. For disc. see
Jamison 1991: 162–63, 172–73. Note that, judging from dhānā́vantam karambhínam
/ apūpávantam ukthínam “possessing grain, possessing gruel, possessing cakes,
possessing hymns” with -vant- and -ín- suffixes respectively, it is difficult to
maintain the often suggested semantic difference between -vant- and -ín-, with -ínmarking inherent possession and -vant- more contingent possession.</p>
<h3 id="viii913">VIII.91.3</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the first hemistich contains pedagogical
vocabulary, the contrastive “we wish to comprehend” (ā́… cikitsāma) and “we will
not ‘recite’ you” (ádhi caná tvā némasi). The lexeme ádhi √i lit. ‘go over’ (which
goes nicely into Engl. in its idiomatic sense); in later Vedic it means ‘study (a text)’,
which is an oral culture means ‘recite aloud’, and this appears to be its meaning here
(contra most tr., incl. Ge and Schmidt). Followed directly by cd, where Apālā
insistently asks the soma to flow “softly” (śánaiḥ … śanakaíḥ), this hemistich
indicates that Apālā wants to learn and understand Indra’s intentions, but she will not
68
reveal his presence by announcing him aloud. (See disc. Jamison 1991: 164 and n.

<p>The compound patidvíṣ- is usually tr. with passive sense (Ge: ‘vom Gatten

and comm. than with the structure of the compound. Grammatically speaking we
would expect an active sense: passive value is fairly rare in root noun compounds,
and, as Scar points out (249), though he does not abandon a possible passive value,
the other -dviṣ- compounds are all active in sense. An interpretation guided by the
compound structure would give ‘hating husbands’, a perhaps not unlikely sentiment
in a pre-adolescent girl about to be married off in ancient India. The verse expresses
the anxious excitement of a girl on the cusp of marriagability and adulthood (Jamison
1991: 170–71).

knees bent, for driving a chariot (note I.37.10 abhijñú yā́tave “abhijñu to drive”), in
this case to bring the prizes to us. The word nṛtúḥ ‘dancer’ at the end of b is

which I find difficult to reconcile with the other occurrences of ā́√yam, including, in
this hymn, ā́yamat in 3c and (abhí) … ā́yaman in 31b. Elsewhere ā́√yam means ‘to
hold (reins, etc.), hold fast, guide’. Here the sense may be that Indra is held (that is,
kept) at the sacrifice by our songs, and there is then a contrast between his
(temporary) immobility and the rousing we hope to give him (c: ā́cyāvayasi).</p>
<h3 id="viii928">VIII.92.8</h3>
<p>This verse then showcases a different kind of immobility for Indra:
ánapacyuta- ‘unbudgeable’; Indra here is not held, as it were, against his will, as
perhaps in 7b, but because of his immense power he cannot be moved by lesser
powers. Since in the immediately preceding verse (7c) the hope was to cause him to
stir (√cyu [cyāvayasi]), it is striking that here it is asserted that he cannot be made to
√cyu. (The relationship between these two forms should probably have been signaled
in the Engl: perhaps “you rouse &hellip; unrousable.”)

<p>Old and Ge take áyāma as expletive “let’s go!” and construe the rest of

this is possible, it requires the poet (dhī́vant-) in question to be a rival poet (so
explicitly Old), and I wonder if we would flatteringly refer to a rival poet as
“visionary.” I think rather that we are appropriating the visionary thoughts of our
own poet and configuring them as steeds for vicotry in battle. For dhī́- = árvant- cf.
VI.45.12 dhībhír árvadbhiḥ &hellip; jeṣma “With visionary thoughts as our steeds might

their desires, presumably).</p>

VIII.92.24–25: On kukṣí- as originally ‘cheek’, not ‘belly’, see Jamison 1987; also
for the pun on dhā́man- ‘foundation’, hence ‘fundament’, that is, ‘buttocks, bottom’,
in vs. 24, but, in vs. 25, ‘foundation, establishment’ in the sense of ‘bestowal’; also
the jocular name Śrutakakṣa in 25.
VIII.92.24–27: The syntagm áram + DAT displays surprisingly complex semantics;
there is generally a relationship of benefit between the subject and the dative, but
which one receives the benefit is not fixed. We can see the shift in these vss., which
contain a surprising number of such constructions: 2x in 24, 3x in 25, 2x in 26, 1x in
27. In 24 the beneficiary is expressed in the dative: the soma is beneficial to these
parts of Indra, but in 27 the singer, who is the subject, by his action (singing)
receives the benefits expressed in the three datives. The switch is esp. clever because
in 24c the dative dhā́mabhyaḥ refers (by my interpr.) to a body part of Indra’s, which
benefits from the soma drops, but the same dative (save for number), índrasya
dhā́mane, in 25c refers more likely (again in my interpr.) to a benefit that Indra will
bestow (though the reading of 24c is also simultaneously possible). This change in
focus is made clear (“repaired) in 26c, áram … dāváne “fit(tingly) for (Indra’s)
giving,” which makes explicit the implication of 25c áram … dhā́mane. Ge (also Bl
RR) supplies “we” as implicit subj. of c: “(wir sind) bereit für deine Schenkung,” but
the playful parallelism with 24c seems to me to exclude this interpretation. The
heavy phrase in 29 … rātíḥ … dhāyi dhātṛ́bhiḥ “(Indra’s) giving has been ordained
by the ordainers” also establishes the link between Indra’s giving and the root √dhā.
The final áram in 27c returns us to the situation found in 24, where the provider of
benefit is the subject (“we”) and the beneficiary in the dative (“you”). I would now
change the tr. to make that clearer: “We should go (to be) fit for you.” On the
particular construction here, áram √gam DAT, see also comm. ad X.9.3.</p>

<p>Klein (318) takes utá as linking śū́raḥ and sthiráḥ “Certainly (thou art)
heroic and firm,” but this assumes that śū́ra- can be adjectival, which, pace Gr, I
don’t. Instead, despite its position, I take the utá as conjoining vīrayúḥ and śū́raḥ …
sthiráḥ, a variant on the complementary pairing of vīrá- ‘hero’ and śū́ra- ‘champion’.
VIII.92.28–29: Ge tr. rā́dhya- as “leicht zu gewinnen,” but I take it rather as “to be
realized, brought to success.” What the content of Indra’s thought is may be clarified
by V.39.3 yát te ditsú prarā́dhyam mánaḥ &hellip; “your thought &hellip; which is eager to give,
should be realized.” The giving theme is made explicit in the next verse. His
intention (the mánas- of 28c) is to give, and this intention will be realized, because
giving (rātí-, 29a) has been ordained as part of his nature. Then 29c reaffirms the
ritual partnership of mutual giving between Indra and his worshipers. I consider Ge’s
“und doch (bist du), Indra, bei mir” not sufficiently specific, esp. given the strong
assertion of connection between us and Indra in the tvā́yujā́(31c), tváyéd … yujā́
71

<p>A difficult hemistich, whose uncertainties include the function of abhí,
the meaning of ā́yaman, and the grammatical identity and use of sū́raḥ. Contra Gr I
do not take abhí as another preverb with ā́√yam. The only other example of abhí-ā́
√yam is in a gerundive in a curious idiom in an Aśvin hymn (I.34.1). Moreover, if it
is a preverb, it has taken an odd position: we generally find preverbs in tmesis at the
beginnings of pādas. I instead take it as governing naḥ. As for ā́yaman, it needs to be
considered in connection with other ā́√yam forms in this hymn, particularly ā́yamat
in 3c (also ā́yatam 7b). In 3c the lexeme means ‘guide’, and I take it so here as well,
with naḥ (read twice) as its object. In this interpretation sū́raḥ is ablative of svàr,
rather than gen. to this stem (Gr, Old, with the latter suggesting it might be a
temporal gen.) or nom. sg. to sū́ra- (Ge).
In c the referent of tát is not specified. Ge thinks it’s the sun, which is
certainly possible.</p>

<p>Ge (flg. Gr) takes bāhvòjasā as an abstract tatpuruṣa (“mit Armes Stärke”),

follow Old in so interpreting it and supplying vájra- as the head noun.
The Pp. analyses vṛtrahā́vadhīt as containing an unaccented avadhīt. I prefer
to read it with accented ávadhīt, which allows the ca to conjoin two parallel relative
clauses. Since in this interpretation the verse consists entirely of relative clauses, it
must be dependent on either the preceding or following verse. Either would work,
but the presence of an apparently resumptive sá beginning 3a favors the latter.</p>

<p>The two vocatives addressed to Indra, vṛtrahan (a) and indra (c), flank that
to the sun (sūrya, b), with the first embedded in a 2nd ps. clause with Sūrya as subject.
Only the unambiguous reference of vṛtrahan to Indra saves it from being applied to
Sūrya, but the effect is still somewhat unsettling.
The verb udágāḥ reprises úd … eṣi expressing the same action in vs. 1. In fact
1a #ud ghéd abhí is echoed by 4b #udágā abhí with the actual verb agā́(ḥ)
substituting for the intervening particles of the former.
VIII.93.4–6: I do not understand the force of the vā in 5a, since this verse does not
seem to me a logical alternative to vs. 4. Nor do I understand the utá-u beginning 5c,
which should not be conjoining the dependent clause of ab with the main clause of c.
However Klein’s discussion (I.450) of utá appears to be on the right track and
probably can account not only for the utá but also for the vā, if the explanation is
fleshed out a bit. It seems that the three verses in this tṛca, esp. the first two, are
72
loosely parallel to each other, esp. in their third pādas. Vss. 4 and 5 begin with a twopāda yád clause (though the two yád-s are functionally different), with the third-pāda
main clause resuming with a tád that is asserted to be in Indra’s domain: 4c sárvaṃ
tád indra te váśe “all that is under your will” and 5c (utá) tát satyám ít táva “just that
(comes) true for you” — with te matching táva and with sárvam and satyám, the
referent and predicate respectively of the two tád-s, phonologically similar. Thus
both the disjunctive vā and the conjunctive utá serve rhetorical purposes, marking
parallel structures, even though those structures do not have parallel or contrastive
content. The third verse (6) varies the structure a bit: instead of yád there are two yés in ab and instead of tád pāda c has tā́n; moreover, c is not a nominal sentence
attributing all to Indra but requires Indra himself to make a move (gachasi ‘you go’).
But sárvāṃs tā́n indra … semi-duplicates 4c sárvaṃ tád indra …, and the same total
control is implied.</p>

<p>The implicitly conjoined nouns ādíś- (‘aim, intention’) and svarā́jya-
(‘sovereignty, self-rule’) do not seem to me to form a natural class. It is possible that
the rendering of the former should be adjusted, to harmonize with the finite verb in
15b. The Pp. analyzes that verb as simply adiṣṭa without preverb, but in its sandhi
situation it could also reflect ā́-(a)diṣṭa, with the same lexeme as here. Even so, the
middle voice of that verb would separate its semantics from the standard active idiom
ā́√diś ‘point to, aim at’.
VIII.93.13–15: The connection among the verses in this tṛca eludes me, though the
fact that they are all set in an apparent mythic past and are joined by logical and/or
temporal connectors (14a ádha, 15a ā́d u) suggests that they should form a thematic

<p>Judging from Ge’s tr. of the first pāda, “Davor sei mir Bewahrung,” he
takes ā́t as an ablative pronoun referring to ámaḥ in 14c (his “Panik,” my
“onslaught”), but as far as I can tell, ā́t is elsewhere only adverbial, as opposed to the
fuller pronominal form asmā́t. I also question his modal, indeed imperatival
interpretation of bhuvat in this preterital context; thematic forms belonging originally
73
to the root aorist stem (á)bhū- can be either subjunctive or a secondarily thematicized
injunctive. See Hoffmann 1967 passim, esp. 214–15.</p>
<h3 id="viii9317">VIII.93.17</h3>
<p>The verse is syntactically incomplete, consisting of an instrumental
phrase (pāda a), a vocative phrase (pāda b), and a subordinate clause with a verb in

provide a main clause for the yád clause, Ge supplies “geschah es” (“it happened”). I
prefer to borrow the verb of the preceding verse, ā́śuṣe, though transposed into a
past tense.</p>

<h3 id="viii9319">VIII.93.19</h3>
<p>This verse presents both a conceptual difficulty (in ab) and a syntactic
one (in c). As for the first, Indra should not be reaching exhilaration though his help
for us, but rather through our soma. Ge sidesteps the difficulty by simply
reinterpreting the lexeme abhí prá √mand as meaning ‘draw near’ (“ziehst du her zu
uns”) without comment, but this relatively common collocation elsewhere always has
the meaning expected of √mad / mand, a meaning that abhī́… mandasānáḥ in 21ab
would reinforce. In order to avoid the conceptually unlikely “by what help for us do
you become exhilarated?” I have supplied “coming” with the kayā́… ūtyā́phrase –
re-establishing the usual balance between what Indra bestows on his worshippers and
the soma they offer him in return.
As for the syntactic problem, imperatives (here bhara) should not appear in
interrogative sentences, and pāda c begins with interrogative káyā. Ge suggests that
the 2nd ps. imperative here is used in analogy to the 1st ps.; in other words, since the
subjunctive is perfectly at home in interrogative clauses and the 1st ps. subjunctive
ultimately comes to serve as the 1st ps. imperative, its use in interrogative clauses
could serve as a model for the introduction of 2nd ps. imperatives in such clauses. But
I doubt that the 1st ps. subjunctive had been reinterpreted as an imperative at this era,
since the full subjunctive paradigm in all three persons was still very much alive, and
in fact Old comments that he does not know of other examples in the older language.
To avoid the syntactic clash I assume that káyā stotṛ́bhyaḥ, parallel to káyā … na
ūtyā́in a, ends the sentence, and ā́bhara constitutes a new, abrupt imperatival clause.
Old cites a similar solution, though taking stotṛ́bhyaḥ with the imperative not the
kayā́clause, found in Grassmann’s tr., also in Caland/Henry’s, which he dismisses as
“künstliches Ueberspringen der Schwierigkeit.” This hardly seems fair, since it does
in fact avoid the difficulty, and seems no more artificial than many interpretations of
syntactically awkward passages. As for my division into clauses as opposed to that of
Gr and Cal/Hen, although stotṛ́bhya ā́bhara is found several times elsewhere as a
syntagm (V.6.1 [and reps.], nearby VIII.77.8), pāda-final ā́bhara is extraordinarily
common and could easily be construed independently, especially since stotṛ́bhyaḥ
would naturally pair with naḥ in these parallel expressions.

<p>“Bring” can be supplied here on the basis of ā́bhara in 19c.</p>
<h3 id="viii9322">VIII.93.22</h3>
<p>Though vītáye is translated as if it were a loc. (“in pursuit”), it is of
course a dative, and “Indra” or “you” should probably be supplied as object of the
infinitive. The “wives” of the pressed drinks are, acdg. to Sāy. and followed by Ge
(and me), the waters; in this soma context cows, standing for cows’ milk, are also
possible, though the occurrence of waters in c supports Sāy.’s suggestion.
Pāda c is difficult, primarily because of the uncertain nicumpunáḥ but also
because of the genitive case of apā́m. To take the latter issue first, Ge assumes the
referent of the nominative phrase is Indra, as “der … Besucher der Gewässer” (apā́ṃ
jágmiḥ). Since jágmi- in the singular is ordinarily used of Indra, this identification
makes sense, but jágmi-, like other nominals of the same formation, always takes
verbal rection, and the goal is expressed in the acc. (ā́havam II.33.11, nṛṣādanam
VII.20.1) or loc. (vidátheṣu I.89.7) – not the gen., as Ge’s tr. requires. For the
baffling nicumpuṇá (and its mantra variants -cuṅkuná- and –caṅkuna) see EWA s.v.
with lit. Mayrhofer cites there an etymological suggestion of Werba’s based on a
proposed MIA form, meaning ‘always filling’. Though there is, of course, no
certainty here, I have adopted this suggestion for want of anything better, though
‘gushing downward’ or Ge’s ‘sprudelnde (?)’ vel sim. would also work; consider
also Old’s “vielleicht ein dem Wasser innewohnender lustrierender Genius.” In any
case, meanings in this sphere do not fit Indra terribly well (as Ge’s “?” in part
indicates), and, coupled with the problem of the case form of apā́m, this suggests that
a different referent be sought for the nominatives in this pāda. I tentatively suggest
supplying ūrmí- ‘wave’, regularly found with apā́m, esp. in soma contexts.</p>
<h3 id="viii9323">VIII.93.23</h3>
<p>The first word of the verse, iṣṭā́ḥ, can belong either to √iṣ ‘desire’ (or the
other √iṣ ‘send’) or √yaj ‘sacrifice, offer’ and should be read as a pun. With Ge the
publ. tr. takes índram as governed by vṛdhā́saḥ (“strengthening Indra” / “den Indra
… stärkend”). I took it so because asṛkṣata has a clear acc. goal in c and does not
need another one. However, I am increasingly uncomfortable with this interpretation,
since vṛdhá- otherwise takes the genitive (see nearby VIII.98.5 sunvató vṛdháḥ and 6
mánor vṛdháḥ), and I would now take índram as another goal with asṛkṣata, hence
“… libations, strengthening at the ceremony, have surged to Indra, to his downstroke”).
The word avabhṛthá- in c is found only here in the RV. In classical śrauta
ritual the avabhṛtha is the “final bath” taken by the sacrificer and his wife at the
conclusion of the ritual, and it is interpreted thus here by Gr, and, although Ge doubts
that it is the final bath, he still takes it as a “Reinungsbad.” I am dubious for a
number of reasons, not least that no one should be bathing in libations (hótrāḥ) and
that the participants in the final bath of later ritual are not gods (as Indra would be
here) but mortals. Instead I think that the verbal lexeme áva √bhṛ, lit. ‘bear down’,
provides the interpretational context for this noun. In the RV verbal forms of this
lexeme sometimes take a weapon in the acc., depicting Indra’s bringing this weapon

down on his opponent (e.g., I.32.9 índro asyā áva vádhar jabhāra “Indra brought his
weapon down upon her”; also vájram X.113.5), or, with an accusative of the
opponent or one of his body parts, of Indra bringing down his enemy (e.g., II.20.6
áva … śíro bharad dāsásaya “he brought down the head of the Dāsa”). Here I think
it refers concretely to Indra’s “down-stroke,” which is strengthened by the soma
offered to him.
VIII.93.25–27: The c pādas of all three verses in this tṛca have the same structure:
dat. pl. stotṛ́bhyaḥ, a form of índra- (acc. 25–26, voc. 27), 2nd ps. imperative.</p>
<h3 id="viii9325">VIII.93.25</h3>
<p>The verse begins with a 2nd ps. pronoun túbhyam, and the content of what
follows, until the end of b, seems entirely consonant with Indra as the 2nd ps. referent.
However, the vocative closing b, vibhāvaso, otherwise used only of Agni, and the
fact that Indra is the 3rd ps. object of the imperative ā́vaha in c, whose subject should
be Agni, call the interpretation of the earlier part of the verse into question. Yet it is
next to impossible, in my view, that the announcing of the soma drinks in a is made
to anyone but Indra, and so we must reckon with a half verse that changed horses in
midstream, as it were, without any poetic benefit accruing.</p>
<h3 id="viii9326">VIII.93.26</h3>
<p>I do not understand Ge’s assertion (n. to 26a), that this verse only makes
sense if Agni is the speaker, a view shared by Old. I certainly agree that Agni is the
subject: I take 26ab as dependent on 25c, where Agni is the 2nd ps. addressee, and
take the participle dádhat of b with the objects found in both a and b, with slightly
different senses (‘diffuse’ in a, ‘distribute’ in b, both with preverb ví).
The VP “diffuse your skill” refers to Agni’s sending his light upward and
outward; the “skill” in question is preumably his ritual skill, his ability to conduct the
oblations to heaven.
The 2nd pl. impv. in c must be addressed to the whole set of ritual participants.
Ge. insists (n. to 26c) that stotṛ́bhyaḥ must be read with pāda b, parallel to dāśúṣe
“die Kleinode verteile für den Opfernden, für die Sänger,” but the rigid parallelism
of the c pādas in this tṛca suggests rather that it belongs with its pāda. Presumably the
full set of participants are chanting on behalf of the subset of “praisers.”</p>
<h3 id="viii9327">VIII.93.27</h3>
<p>Again I read the verb ā́… dadhāmi with both pādas, with slightly
different senses with the two different objects and with te read as gen. with pāda a
and dat. with pāda b.
VIII.93.28–30: A variant of the final pāda of the last tṛca (27c stotṛ́bhya indra
mṛḷaya) becomes the refrain of this tṛca (yád indra mṛḷáyāsi naḥ).
VIII.93.31–33: As noted in the publ. intro., the first pāda of the first verse of this tṛca
provides its refrain, a slightly odd effect. Only in 31 is the refrain syntactically
integrated into the verse. There are also echoes of previous verses: śatakrato, which
ends 27b and 28b, appears as nom. śatákratuḥ at the end of 32b. The voc.
76
vṛtrahantama of 30a is echoed by nom. vṛtrahántamaḥ in 32a and voc. vṛtrahan in
the same metrical position in 33a. The end of this hymn is very tightly constructed.</p>
<h3 id="viii9334">VIII.93.34</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., this verse falls outside the tṛca structure and
seems unconnected to the rest of the hymn. As Ge points out, it plays on two of the
names of the Ṛbhus, ṛbhú- itself and vā́ja-. Note also the alliteration, esp. in pāda b:
ṛbhukṣáṇam ṛbhúṃ rayím.</p>
<h2 id="viii94-maruts">VIII.94 Maruts</h2>
<p>VIII.94.1–2: For the somewhat peculiar imagery of these vss., see the publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="viii942">VIII.94.2</h3>
<p>Curiously, vratā́… dhāráyante seems to be the only full VP with vratá- as
obj. of a verbal form of √dhṛ, despite the common (nearly 20x) bahuvrīhi dhṛtávrata- ‘whose commandments are upheld’.
There are several ways to construe the dual dvandva sū́ryāmā́sā of c. Ge takes
it as a separate obj. of dhāráyante, Re. as an additional subj. of the same verb, while I
take it as the subj. of the purpose inf. dṛśé.</p>
<h3 id="viii943">VIII.94.3</h3>
<p>The first pāda has been subjected to a dizzying number of different
interpretations, primarily because of the uncertain sense of the resonant word aryáḥ
in context, which is complicated by its ambiguous grammatical identity: it can be gen.
or abl. sg. or nom. or acc. pl. of arí- or even nom. sg. of aryá-. In addition to the
standard treatments, see also Oldenberg ZDMG 54 (=KlSch. p. 79), Bl RR ad
VI.45.33, Thieme Fremdling 74ff. I won’t discuss the various suggested alternatives,
but simply present my own. I take aryáḥ as abl. sg.; as for the immediately following
ā́, I give it a double interpr. On the one hand it is a postposition with aryáḥ in the
meaning ‘from’; the phrase aryá ā́is found elsewhere and always in this sense
(VIII.34.10, IX.61.11, X.191.1, in addition to the repetition of our pāda in VI.45.33).
Any interpr. that requires aryáḥ to be some other case than abl. sg. needs to confront
this formulaic evidence. But in my interpr. ā́is also a preverb with gṛṇanti. I take the
lexeme ā́√gṛ to be built on the model of the common ā́√yaj ‘bring here by sacrifice’
and mean ‘bring here by song / sing here’. Our bards attract the Maruts away from
the stranger (aryáḥ) to our soma-sacrifice.
“All the bards” (víśve … kārávaḥ) here contrasts with “all the gods” (devā́ḥ
… víśve) in the preceding verse, both sets of beings operating in the same territory,
the ritual ground.
The publ. tr. fails to tr. sádā ‘always’; it should read “… always sing them
here …”</p>
<h3 id="viii944">VIII.94.4</h3>
<p>The opening of this vs. seems unnecessarily over-annunciatory, with both
ásti and ayám, each equivalent to “here is.” One would have been enough.
There is some dissension about the referent of svarā́jaḥ, which cannot, of
course, modify the (dual) Aśvins. Gr, flg. Ludwig, takes it as a gen. sg. referring to
77
soma. The stem modifies the Maruts in V.58.1, and as a nom. pl. could match
marútaḥ in b, except that the utá is then wrongly placed. Ge and Old are surely right
that it refers to the Ādityas (as in VII.66.6), who appear individually in the next vs.
and who are esp. associated with vratá’s, mentioned already in vs. 2. Klein (DGRV
I.439), however, essentially rejects this solution for reasons that aren’t clear to me
and calls the issue “unresolved.”</p>
<h3 id="viii945">VIII.94.5</h3>
<p>For the phrase tánā pūtásya, cf. I.3.4 tánā pūtā́saḥ, IX.16.8 tánā punānāḥ.
jā́vant- is a hapax and is surely a truncation of common prajā́vant-, likewise
‘possessing/granting offspring’, which occurs elsewhere in iambic cadences. In the
IXth Maṇḍala Soma is asked on a number of occasions to bring or produce
substances that are prajā́vant-, e.g. prajā́vad réta ā́bhara “bring here semen
producing offspring.”</p>
<h3 id="viii946">VIII.94.6</h3>
<p>The “(drinks)” supplied in ab is not strictly necessary, since the genitives
could be construed with matsati in c (so Ge/Re). I have supplied it because √pā
‘drink’ is the signature verb of this tṛca (píbanti 4b, 5a), but I am not wedded to it.
VIII.94.7–8: I take the initial kád in both verses as a question particle, introducing a
rhetorical question. Ge, Re, and Etter (p. 236) take the kád in 8 as a neut. acc.
interrogative adj. modifing ávaḥ (“which help?”), though they all take the kád in 7 as
a question particle. I do not see the justification for violating the evident parallelism
of the two verses, and I also wonder if we get a choice of the kind of help the gods
are going to provide us.</p>
<h3 id="viii949">VIII.94.9</h3>
<p>With Ge and Old, I borrow huve ‘I call’ from 10 to govern pāda c. See
also vs. 3 above with the same c pāda, there governed by (ā̇́) … gṛṇanti.</p>
<h2 id="viii95-indra">VIII.95 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii951">VIII.95.1</h3>
<p>Though Gr identifies rathī́ḥ here as a nom. plural, thus a devī-type form
beside the correct vṛkī-type rathi
yàḥ found elsewhere, there is no reason not to take it
as the nom. singular it appears to be, since number agreement in similes is not so
strictly carried through in RV as in Classical poetics. So also AiG III.179 (though
taking it as nom. sg. used as nom. pl.).
The image itself is somewhat striking: the songs mounting Indra as their
chariot. Indra is usually the active charioteer figure.</p>
<h3 id="viii952">VIII.95.2</h3>
<p>HvN restore the sandhi in a (asyā́ndhasa) as asya ándhasa, but asyá
should surely be accented, with the Pp., because it modifies ándhasaḥ rather than
being used pronominally.
I follow Ge in supplying vikṣú with the fem. víśvāsu in c, on the basis of 3d.
But other nouns are possible: just in nearby hymns víśvāsu is found with samátsu
78
(‘battles’, VIII.90.2), gīṛṣú (‘hymns’, VIII.92.7), and kṛṣṭíṣu (‘communities’,
VIII.92.18), and a semantic case could be made for each of these, even the first.</p>
<h3 id="viii954">VIII.95.4</h3>
<p>Tiraścī Āṅgirasa is the poet of VIII.95-103, according to the Anukramaṇī.</p>
<h3 id="viii955">VIII.95.5</h3>
<p>The verse consists entirely of a relative clause with no main clause, but the
referent of the relative must be Tiraścī of 4a, despite the intervening matter in 4c, as
the similar structures of 4b and 5a indicate: # índra yás tvā and # índra yás te
respectively.
Note the interplay of návīyasam ‘newer’ and pratnā́m ‘age-old’, expressing
the standard RVic poetic trope of making an old song new again. So also Ge (n. to
5cd).
VIII.95.7–9: See the intro. for the curious density in this tṛca of the ppl. śuddhá-
‘cleansed’, which is not normal soma vocabulary. I do not understand what ritual or
conceptual feature is at issue. Ge cites Sāy’s story about the purification of Indra
after his killing of Vṛtra. This may be relevant, but there is no reference to Indra’s
deeds or activities in this tṛca, save for the final hemistich in vs. 9, where we find
vṛtrā́ṇi jighnase “you keep smashing obstacles” – an allusion to Vṛtra but couched in
present time and plural number.</p>
<h3 id="viii957">VIII.95.7</h3>
<p>Instead of HvN’s restoration nu índram (for nv índram), nú should of
course be accented.
VIII.95.7-8: These two vss. contain successive occurrences of the pf. act. impv. built
to √mad: 3rd sg. mamattu (7d), 2nd sg. mamaddhi (8d). Despite their apparently
parallel formation, they have distinct transitivity values: the 3rd sg. is transitive, the
2nd sg. not. This difference is consistent in the usage of the two forms: the other
instance of mamaddhí (X.96.13) is also intransitive, the 10 of the other 11
occurrences of mamáttu are transitive (save for late X.59.2) The difference may have
arisen from the fact that, while mamáttu is a properly formed impv. to the pf. of
√mad with expected full grade of the root syllable, in the 2nd sg. we should expect
zero grade, hence *ma-md-dhí, which would probably simplify to *mandhí, with the
superficially unredupl. weak perfect stem mand-, which is reinterpreted as a
secondary root. Hence mamaddhí must be secondarily formed. I do not understand
why this would affect its valency, though.</p>
<h2 id="viii96-indra">VIII.96 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="viii961">VIII.96.1</h3>
<p>I read ā́tiranta as preverb ā́plus injunctive tiranta (and so better
transcribed as ā́tiranta), contra Pp. and Gr. This allows a presential, general reading
for the injunctive, which will match the pf. tasthuḥ in c (usually presential, acdg. to
Kü), and describes the general cosmic obedience to Indra, rather than a particular
historical event. With Ge I take this verb as providing the framework for pāda b as
79
well, though I consider náktam adverbial, rather than the object of the verb, as Ge
and Old take it.</p>
<h3 id="viii962">VIII.96.2</h3>
<p>In d “deeds” needs to be supplied, to account for the number differential
between tád (c) and yā́ni (d).</p>
<h3 id="viii963">VIII.96.3</h3>
<p>The Pp. reads śrútyai in d (so also Ge, Schmidt B+I), but I follow Gr in
taking it as śrútyā́ḥ, agreeing with krátavaḥ in c. Ol considers both interpretations
possible and does not make a determination.</p>
<h3 id="viii964">VIII.96.4</h3>
<p>Since yajñíyam is not a superlative, the “the most” of the publ. tr. should
be in parentheses.</p>
<h3 id="viii965">VIII.96.5</h3>
<p>The verbal counterpart to 2nd sg. dhatsé in the relative cl. (ab) is
augmented ánavanta in the main clause (cd). I would therefore prefer to take dhatsé
as a medial, preterital perfect, rather than as a present. Gr and Lu identify it as
present, Ge translates it as one, and Kü (p. 275) explicitly claims that -i-liaison forms
belong to the perfect, while those without the -i- are presents. Nonetheless, I think we
can interpret dhatsé, the only such 2nd sg., as a perfect, next to very common dadhiṣé,
esp. as only this form would fit in a Triṣṭubh cadence.
The accent on main-clause ánavanta must result from its membership in the
repeated prá subclauses.
I take the formulators in d as the Maruts; Ge suggests either Aṅgirases or
Maruts. Since the next tṛca (vss. 7–9) clearly contains the 1st ps. speech of the Maruts,
and the next verse (6) has 1st ps. speech that can reasonably attributed to the Maruts,
their introduction here would not be surprising.</p>
<h3 id="viii966">VIII.96.6</h3>
<p>Ge (so also Gr) takes ávarāṇy asmāt as temporal: “die nach ihm kommen,”
whereas I interpret it spatially. Though “later than him” is possible, it seems
pleonastic, in that if Indra begat them, they would have to be later than him. The idea
is rather that they exist here on earth, below him,, and also that he begot them as
subordinates. Cf. vrjánem ̥ ā́varāṇi “these communities here below” (IX.96.7) and
bándhūm̐r imā́m̐ávarān “these bonds here below” (IX.97.17), which both seem
spatial, not temporal, also.</p>
<h3 id="viii968">VIII.96.8</h3>
<p>Although the med. pf. of √vṛdh is ordinarily intransitive or reflexive,
vāvṛdhānā́ḥ is here best interpreted as transitive in the frame (“increasing you,” with
tvā in a as obj.) but intransitive in the simile (“as ruddy throngs increase,” with the
nominative NP usrā́iva rāśáyaḥ). See X.78.8 for a similar example of case
disharmony.</p>
<h3 id="viii969">VIII.96.9</h3>
<p>However tempting it might be, the juxtaposed phrase ásurā adevā́ḥ is most
likely not to be interpreted as an early instantiation of the Asura/Deva conflict of
middle Vedic times. Instead it probably refers to human or semi-divine lords (for the
80
former see W. E. Hale, 1986: 83) who do not have the gods on their side. Hale points
out that adevá- is the only form in the RV so accented (contrasting with ádeva-), and
it must be a bahuvrīhi meaning “not having gods, without gods.”</p>
<h3 id="viii9610">VIII.96.10</h3>
<p>In d tanvè might be more comfortably rendered “for his own person”
with Ge (“für seine Person”), but tanvì in the following verse seems to require a
‘body’ reading.
VIII.96.13–15: As indicated in the intro., the identity of the ‘droplet’ (drapsá-) and
the purport of this tṛca are quite unclear. Ge takes both drapsá- and kṛṣṇá- (‘black’)
as PNs and the tṛca as their “saga.” Since such a saga is otherwise unknown and both
words have lexical meaning, such an approach does not seem to gain us much. Old’s
discussion is, as usual, very sharp, but his own interpretation, that Indra is helping an
embryonic version of Bṛhaspati, in the form of a drop of semen, to come to birth,
also does not convince. Schmidt (1968: 112-13) rejects Old’s interpretation and
suggests that it describes in mystical fashion the freeing of the soma-drop in the form
of the sun, but declines to tr. the tṛca because of the many uncertainties. I am inclined
to see it as a treatment of the ritual step of rinsing the soma in water, as I said in the
publ. intro., though much remains murky.
VIII.96.16–18: These three vss. begin tváṃ ha tyád. As elsewhere with this
configuration (2ND SG. PRN ha tyád), with a neut. tyád without a neut. referent, ha tyád
seems to be strongly emphatic (see a similar sequence in I.63.4–7 and comm. ad loc.
as well as ad VI.18.3). I would now be inclined to change the tr. of the three vss. here
to “It was just you who …”</p>
<h3 id="viii9616">VIII.96.16</h3>
<p>The identity of the “seven” is unclear; ordinarily that number refers to
rivers or priestly offices, but neither makes sense here. However, Ge (n. to 16a)
points to seven enemies destroyed by Indra in X.49.8, 120.6.
Ge takes vibhu-mánt- (only here) as ‘die in dir einen Gebieter hatten’; this
might be plausible, because Indra is characterized as vibhū́in 11 and so creatures
associated with him might possess him as vibhú-. But the problem is that vibhú-/ū́- is
only adjectival, as far as I can tell, and does not have the ‘lord, master’ meaning
presupposed here. Though possessive -vant-/-mant- stems should be built to nouns,
Debrunner (AiG II.2.877–78) allows for pleonastic use of the suffix with adjectives
in this and a number of other cases.</p>
<h3 id="viii9618">VIII.96.18</h3>
<p>Noteworthy here is the variant on the expression of Indra’s standard deed,
vṛtrám √han and esp. his epithet vṛtrahán- in the phrase ghanó vṛtrā́ṇām “the bane of
obstacles,” with the nominal ghaná- from √han and a pl. of vṛtrá-.
On √stambh with the waters as obj. see comm. ad II.11.5.</p>
<h3 id="viii9619">VIII.96.19</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., I interpret this verse as containing a
riddle (a-c) and its answer (d), an interpretation at odds with Ge (flg. Sāy), who takes
81
all of the verse until its last word as part of a single description of Indra. His
rendering of d, “der Vṛtratöter ist (jedem) anderen gewachsen, so sagen sie” is
grammatically impossible because āhuḥ ought then to be accented; prátī́d anyám
āhuḥ must be a separate clause (as Old also takes it, though with implausible
semantics). In my interpretation the first three pādas present several different
descriptions of Indra’s characteristics and activities. Although these descriptions are
fairly transparent, they do not name Indra, whereas the first two words of pāda d, sá
vṛtrahā́, names him by his standing epithet and serves as answer to the implicit riddle
posed by the first three pādas. Although this interpretation is more complex than
Ge’s, it allows us to account for the odd finale of d and especially for the anyám,
which by my rules (Fs. Beekes, 1997) should have a definite reading, “the other.” I
take this “other” to be the poser of the riddle, and the unidentified speakers of d
triumphantly respond to him with the solution. That the first two words of the final
two verses of the tṛca (and the hymn) repeat sá vṛtrahā́of 19d, followed by the actual
name of the god, lends support to my interpretation of vs. 19.
I tr. loc. sutéṣu in a as if it were a genitive; “enjoyer at the pressings” would
be possible, but just a little less parsable in English.
I am somewhat puzzled by the simile of b: yó áheva revā́n. Ge takes the áhā
(so Pp.) as the comparandum with Indra and revā́n as the shared quality (“der wie die
(neuen) Tage prangend ist”), but revánt- doesn’t mean ‘resplendent’; rather, as a
derivative of rayí-‘ wealth’, it means ‘rich, wealthy’. Moreover, in similes, áhā,
marked by iva, several times precedes the actual comparandum and serves as
adverbial qualifier – e.g., I.130.2 áhā víśveva sū́ryam “like the sun through all the
days” (cf. also áheva in VI.61.9), and so I interpret it here, though I admit it is still
not a compelling image.
In c the Saṃhitā text reads náryápāṃsi (as also in I.85.9), with five syllables,
suggesting a word separation nári ápāṃsi and so analyzed by Pp. (followed by
Aufrecht and HvN). But this must represent, one way or another, the collocation
náryā + ápāṃsi, found in opposite order even in this same tṛca (21c ápāṃsi náryā;
see also IV.19.10, as well as ápāṃsi … náryāṇi VII.21.4; also the bahuvrīhi
náryāpas- in nearby VIII.93.1). Grassmann suggests reading *náryā́pāṃsi, as does
Old (ad I.85.9)(see also Macdonell Vedic Reader ad I.85.9), and this “slight
emendation” (Macdonell’s words) not only fixes the morphology but also restores a
more standard break ( ̮ ̮ _ ) for the three shorts ( ̮ ̮ ̮) found (though the latter
break is by no means uncommon). However, Lubotsky apparently takes nári here as
the loc. to the noun nṛ́- (the náryápāṃsi passages would contain the only locatives to
this stem in the RV), and Ge adduces the somewhat parallel case of vṛ́śṇi … śávaḥ
(V.35.4, VIII.3.10), vṛ́śṇi paúṃsyam (VIII.7.23). Like our nári ápāṃsi / ápāṃsi
náryā, the former collocation exists alongside one with a properly formed -iyaadjective, vṛ́ṣṇ(i)yaṃ śávaḥ (VIII.3.8 [same hymn as one of the truncated
occurrences], VIII.51.10 IX.64.2). But the easy fix available to the nári ápāṃsi case
(lengthening the vowel of ápāṃsi) is not available for the vṛ́ṣṇi examples.
I do not know quite what to do with all this. The vṛ́ṣṇi case looks to me like an
artificial truncation that nonetheless was original to the text, while I’m inclined to see
82
nári as a redactional change, perhaps on the model of vṛ́ṣṇi. I am thus willing to
follow Gr, Old, and Macdonell in emending to *náryā́pāṃsi. However, these are, to
say the least, quite subjective criteria, and I am not at all convinced these views are
correct. It is nonetheless possible to sketch a possible but problematic scenario for
these developments. The two examples of vṛ́śṇi te śávaḥ are nominal clauses. Cf.</p>
<h3 id="viii310-1">VIII.3.10</h3>
<p>tád indra vṛ́ṣṇi te śávaḥ, rendered in the publ. tr. “that is your bullish vast
power, Indra,” with vṛ́ṣṇi nominally a neut. sg. to an otherwise non-existent i-stem
adj. But it might be possible instead to take it as the loc. sg. of vṛ́ṣan-, with vṛ́ṣṇi …
śávaḥ “the power is in the bull.” Though in a cursory look I have found no śávaḥ +
LOC. constructions in the RV, other abstract words for power do figure in such
syntagms (including in our hymn, VIII.96.3). See, e.g., V.33.6 papṛkṣéṇyam indra tvé
hí ójaḥ, nṛmṇā́ni ca … “For, Indra, in you are strength to be nurtured and manly
powers.” There are two fundamental problems with this suggestion: 1) the zero-grade
loc. -ni to -an-stems is not found in the RV; we find only full-grade -ani; 2) it is hard
to construe the te, since the bull and 2nd ps. Indra are coreferential. “This power of
yours is in (you,) the bull” is awkward and unlikely. A bolder hypothesis – bolder
than I would venture – would link these two problems and reconstruct an underlying
syntagm *vṛ́ṣaṇi śávaḥ with full-grade loc. and no enclitic pronoun. When the posited
vṛ́ṣaṇi reduced to vṛ́ṣṇi (perhaps because of association with adjectival vṛ́ṣṇ(i)ya-), te
was introduced to maintain the metrical shape. There are no other attested examples
of the loc. sg. of vṛ́ṣan- in the RV to support the trisyllabic reading. In any case, in
this scenario the old loc. would be reinterpreted as an endingless adjectival or
adverbial element in this collocation, alternating with syntactically impeccable
vṛ́ṣṇ(i)yaṃ śávaḥ. With this set up, we can get nári on this model:
vṛ́ṣṇ(i)yaṃ śávaḥ : vṛ́śṇi … śávaḥ
ápāṃsi náryā : nári ápāṃsi
I believe this development was redactional rather than found in the ur-text. First
because vṛ́śṇi … śávaḥ is a plausible neut. sg. phrase, but with the pl. ápāṃsi an
endingless nári is more difficult. Moreover, an abstract quality located in a being
(like “strength is in the bull”) is a much more likely notion than “labors are in the
man.” And the metrical evidence strongly favors an original *náryā́pāṃsi, though it
does not entirely rule out the short vowel.
But I lay out this scenario very skeptically, primarily because of the wrong
grade in the posited loc. sg. Here I would point out that the same trouble would
afflict any attempt to explain vṛ́ṣṇ(i)ya- as a thematic descasuative derivative from a
locative by pointing to the two synchronically alternating syntagms here. Such a
derivation for *-(i)yo-possessive adjectives in general has been proposed (see Balles,
Sprache 39 [1997 (2000)] 141-67, cited from Meier-Brügger, Indo-European
Linguistics, 283-84, for which ref. I thank JL). I do not believe that the last word has
been said about this issue.</p>
<h3 id="viii9621">VIII.96.21</h3>
<p>Note the full syntagm ápāṃsi náryā responding to the náryápāṃsi in 19c.
Gerundives occasionally take dative agents, like sákhibhyaḥ here. Cf., e.g.,

cakra, 5a yád, 5c yát.</p>
<h3 id="viii971">VIII.97.1</h3>
<p>The relative phrase yā́ḥ … bhújaḥ “which delightful things” has no
obvious correlative expression in the main clause of cd. Ge supplies “(mit denen),”
which is certainly possible and perhaps the default option. But following a
suggestion of Old’s, I take the asya of c, otherwise unaccounted for, as the functional
correlative, despite the difference in number and gender. Because it is unaccented,
asya should be pronominal and refer to something already present in the discourse,
and there are few candidates, esp. because stotár- doesn’t seem to take a genitive. It
would not be surprising to resume the fem. expression “delightful things” simply
with “that (stuff).” The masc. singular referring to the goods Indra has acquired
continues in vs. 2, with the yám … tám pair. I tr. asya “from that” rather than “of
that,” since the latter doesn’t parse well in English.
In cd stotā́ram … yé ca … vṛktábarhiṣaḥ is a nice example of the “X and
which Y” construction.</p>
<h3 id="viii972">VIII.97.2</h3>
<p>Ge tr. ávyayam as ‘ohne Einbusse’ (loss), rather than ‘ovine, belonging to
sheep’ (contra Gr, etc.), presumably because of its initial accent (against the normal
accent in avyáya- ‘ovine’). This seems unnecessary. The other occurrence of ávyaya-
(IX.86.34) modifies the soma filter and Ge renders it “aus Schafwolle” without
comment. In our passage he is following Sāy’s vyayarahitam, but vyaya-
‘disappearance, loss, outlay’ is not attested until the epic/Classical language, as far as
I know. Furthermore, sheep fit nicely into this equine and bovine context, with the
three terms áśvaṃ gā́m bhāgáṃ ávyayam displaying a classic Behagel’s Law
configuration. As for the aberrant accent, Debrunner (AiG II.2.213) attributes it to
the influence of semantically identical ávya-.
Ge takes the locative phrase in c with ab, “Welches Ross und Rind du … als
Anteil … bestimmt hat für den Opfernden …” Again this seems odd and unnecessary.
The locatives of c are summarized by tásmin in d, and contrast with paṇaú at the end
of that pāda. Moreover the middle voice of dadhiṣé in the relative clause contrasts
functionally with the act. imperative dhehi in the main clause. First Indra acquires
goods for himself, then confers them on others. By placing the recipient in the rel.
clause with the middle verb, Ge erases this neat voice contrast. Pāda c then seems to
represent a heavy preposed NP picked up by initial tásmin in d.</p>
<h3 id="viii973">VIII.97.3</h3>
<p>Note the doubling of pres. sásti ‘sleeps’ with the adverbial gerund
anuṣvā́pam. In Jamison 1982/83 I argue that the gerund is used here because the poet
84
wanted to use a pres. tense of √svap but didn’t really know one, since the various
presents to this root are secondary and to some extent improvisational.
The end of the verse … dhehi táṃ tátaḥ with its two final pronominals is
striking, but clearly constructed as the mirror image of 2d tásminn táṃ dhehi. The
good sacrificer of 2cd is contrasted with the godless, vowless man of 3, and it may
not be entirely fanciful to suggest that the unusual word order — tá-forms ordinarily
occurring at the beginning of clauses — is a syntactic expression of his perverse
nature.</p>
<h3 id="viii974">VIII.97.4</h3>
<p>Following Ge I take keśíbhiḥ “hairy-maned (horses)” as an appositional
simile with gīrbhíḥ: the hymns serve as the team that brings Indra to us along
“heaven’s way.”
This latter form, dyugát ‘heaven-going’ vel sim., is extensively discussed by
Scar (106–7), who ultimately concludes that it is “unklar,” though he favors taking it
as a nom. sg. modifying the soma presser (sutā́vān). This seems odd: the somapresser is the one element in this verse who is likely to stay put. I take it, with Gr and
(implicitly) Old, as adverbial, referring to the movement of the hymns, as
metaphorical horses, through heaven. In his note Ge endorses Sāy’s interpretation of
it is a shortening of dyugádbhiḥ, which (as Wolff’s suggestion) Old dismisses
without argument. This explanation by truncation certainly does not seem necessary,
since a neuter adverb works well enough.
VIII.97.7–9: The da capo-like structure of the verses in this tṛca, with the first pāda
repeated verbatim as the last one, is quite unusual.</p>
<h3 id="viii977">VIII.97.7</h3>
<p>I have chosen to read the impv. bhávā in b with the two small clauses in c
as well, though it is certainly possible to interpret those with Ge as straight indicative
nominal clauses: “you (are) there with help …; you (are) friendship …”</p>
<h3 id="viii9710">VIII.97.10</h3>
<p>Although they belong to different tṛcas, 10ab responds to vs. 9: in both
Indra is characterized by the lexeme abhí √bhū ‘dominate, surmount’ (9c abhibhū́ḥ,
10a abhibhū́taram), with each governing an NP beginning with víśva-. Moreover, in
vs. 9 it is said that gods (as well as mortals) have not attained (āśata) Indra, while in
10ab the gods appear to be the implied subject of the verbs tatakṣuḥ and jajanuḥ
“fashioned and begot” – in other words, paradoxically, though they do not attain him
they are credited with creating him.
In c there is pseudo-etymological play between váriṣṭḥaṃ váre, which not
only are unrelated but also belong to two different NPs, despite their adjaceny. There
is some uncertainty about the position of utá or even what it is conjoining. Klein
(DGRV I.346, 349) considers the pāda an XY utá construction, joining the two
complex NPs that precede it, with the adjectives in d “merely strung on to the basical
phrasal syntagm” (346).
The etymological figure ugrám ójiṣṭham, with a positive and its superlative, is
reminiscent of the simplex followed by comparative in 9c / 10a abhibhū́ḥ …
85
abhibhū́taram. The rest of pāda d, tavásam tarasvínam, almost mimics an
etymological figure via phonological scrambling, although the words are of course
unrelated.</p>
<h3 id="viii9711">VIII.97.11</h3>
<p>There is phonetic play between asvaran (a; see also abhisvárā 1b) to
√svar ‘sound’ and s
u
var(-pati)(c) containing the ‘sun’ word, although the latter of
course has a distracted sv cluster.</p>
<h3 id="viii9712">VIII.97.12</h3>
<p>I use two different English tr. for namanti, ‘bend’ and ‘bow’, depending
on the object; this is merely an English problem, as the passage adduced by Ge
shows: VII.23.20 ā́&hellip; índram &hellip; name girā́, nemíṃ táṣṭeva.
In cd I supply ‘cry out’ (√svar) on the basis of 11a sám … asvaran (note the
sám in 12d) and 12b (abhi)svárā.
Ge takes tarasvínaḥ as nom. pl., which is grammatically possible, but I prefer
Old’s gen. sg. (an alternative also for Gr), since the same adj. modifies Indra in 10d.</p>
<h3 id="viii9713">VIII.97.13</h3>
<p>The ca in c is one of the rare examples of subordinating ca in the RV, as
shown by the accent induced on the verb vavártat; see Klein DGRV I.240–41. Its
position, about which Klein does not comment, is peculiar, but it can probably be
accounted for metrically. In this particular Atijagatī line (13 syl.), there is a natural
break after the first two words (5 syllables), máṃhiṣṭho gīrbhír, and the rest of the
line behaves as if it were a dimeter (8-syl.) line, ā́ca yajñíyo vavártat, with initial
preverb followed by the enclitic conjunction.</p>
<h3 id="viii9714">VIII.97.14</h3>
<p>The final word in a, enā, is taken as enāḥ by the Pp., a reading followed
by Gr, Ge, Old, and Lub; in this interpretation it modifies or doubles (since ena- is a
pronominal, not an adjectival demonstrative stem) fem. acc. pl. púraḥ earlier in the
pāda. I do not rule this out, but wonder whether it can be the enclitic instr. sg. enā to
ayám in the meaning ‘in that way, i.e., how’. See enā ‘thereby’ in V.2.11, in addition
to personal uses (‘with him’) in IX.96.2, X.108.3.
Pāda b collects several words that have been prominent in the characterization
of Indra earlier in the hymn: ójasā (ójiṣṭham 10d), śaviṣṭha (śavasas pate 6b, śávasā
9c), and śakra (śakra 4a). It is esp. clever that the grammatical identities of the first
two terms have been switched: s-stem instr. to superlative and vice versa.
Note that though cd forms a single clause with two different subjects (“all the
worlds” and “heaven and earth”), the dual verb rejete agrees with the nearer one, the
decomposed dual dvandva dyā́vā … pṛthivī́ca.
VIII.97.14–15: Both Lü (Var. 20, 506) and Schlerath (Kö. 139) consider this
sequence to be a satyakriya. I can see the point, but if it is a truth-formulation, it is a
muted one. The concept is clearest in 15a “Let this truth be protective of me,” esp.
since this is the last verse of the hymn. The truth-formulation itself could be either
the preceding verse (so Lüders) or the whole hymn (Schlerath allows both
possibilities). In the absence of the standard instrumental ṛtéṇa (later satyena) that
86
signals a satyakriya I am reluctant to label it as such, though certainly it is akin.
Schlerath also point out that the last word of the hymn is rājan.</p>
<h3 id="viii9715">VIII.97.15</h3>
<p>“The distillate of all mother’s milk” for viśvápsnya- assumes the
etymological connection between -psnya- and stána- ‘breast’, which is now standard
doctrine. See EWA s.v. stána-.</p>
<h2 id="viii98-indra">VIII.98 Indra</h2>
<p>VIII.98.2–3: Parts of these two verses reappear, verbatim or slightly modified, in
X.170.4, a hymn to Sūrya: 3ab = X.170.4ab, while the first two words of 2c nom. sg.
viśvákarmā viśvádevaḥ correspond to the inst. sg. phrase viśvákarmaṇā
viśvádevyāvatā in X.170.4d. In our hymn the subject of 3ab is Indra, who is also the
referent of the nom. sg. phrase in 2c; in X.170.4 the referent in both cases is Sūrya.
Because of the verbatim correspondence of 3ab and X.170.4ab save for the identity
of the subject, I think they should be translated in the same way. I therefore take svàr
in a as nominative and an implicit simile and rocanám in b as an accusative of goal.
Ge by contrast takes svàr in our 3a also as an accusative of goal, parallel to rocanám:
“Im Licht erstrahlend gingst du zur Sonne, zum Himmelslicht,” whereas in X.170.4
he takes them both as nominatives: “Im Licht erstahlend kamst du als Sonne als
Himmelslicht…” Although of course nothing forbids different interpretations of
identical phaseology in different contexts, in situtations where identical
interpretations are possible (as here) it seems best not to vary the translations.
The bahuvrīhi epithet of Indra viśvákarmā (2c) is of course a play on the
divine figure of the same name, whereas the bahuvrīhi viśvádeva- (also 2c) makes
reference to the corporate entity the All Gods (víśve devā́ḥ). The former is simply
applied directly to Sūrya in X.170.4d, whereas viśvádeva- has gone through some
derivational shenanigans, producing a doubly (or triply) marked viśvádevyi
yā-vant-.</p>
<h3 id="viii984">VIII.98.4</h3>
<p>The impv. gadhi is a hapax, beside gahi, which occurs 84 times (per Lub.).
The latter is almost always pāda-final and, when internal, never occupies this precise
metrical position (4th and 3rd syllables from end), but although this slight indication of
complementary distribution might ordinarily not be sufficient to account for the
different endings, the distribution of the two forms fits a more general pattern. The
gahi / gadhi question is obviously part of a larger phenomenon, or rather two: 1) the
distribution of -hi vs. -dhi in the 2nd sg. imperative, 2) the conditioning for the
general loss of occlusion in voiced aspirates, esp. *dh &gt; h. As for the former question,
various generalizations work for various defined groups of forms – e.g., that -dhi
occurs after consonants – but other groups show fluctuation, particularly disyllabic
imperatives. Re (GLV §58) suggests that in this class -hi should be the preference
after long vowel and -dhi after short vowel, but that the forms “usées,” stuhi, ihi, and
gahi, have generalized -hi “mieux propre évidemment à l&rsquo;elocution rapide.” This is
not particularly satisfactory.
87
The most recent discussion of the whole phenomenon that I know of is
Lubotsky’s “Sanskrit h&lt;*dh, bh” (Sthāpakašrāddham, Professor G.A. Zograph
Commemorative Volume, ed. N. V. Gurov and Ya. V. Vasil’kov. Pp. 124-44. St.
Peterburg: Orientalia, 1995 [1997], available at <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1887/14207),">http://hdl.handle.net/1887/14207),</a>
showing his characteristic thoroughness and clarity of presentation. Dismissing
previous claims that the phenomenon is dialectal since the *dh &gt; h change is found in
grammatical forms and unlikely to be due to borrowing, he suggests that it must be
due to a conditioned sound law and that apparent exceptions to this sound law must
be explained on a case-to-case basis. The sound law he proposes is *-VdhV# &gt; -VhV#.
I will not discuss how he handles exceptions to this rule in other grammatical and
lexical categories, but obviously the rule defines forms like śrudhi, kṛdhi, and our
gadhi as exceptions. Again, I will not treat all his explanations of non-conforming -
dhi imperatives, but concentrate on disyllables with -dhi after short vowel. For kṛdhí
and other forms in -ṛ (vṛdhi, spṛdhi), he assumes that ṛ blocks the application of the
rule, on the assumption that the older pronunciation of ṛ was [ər] (p. 136), while for
śrudhí he examines distributional factors. Most important for him is the fact that
śrudhi most often shows up in the formula śrudhī hávam (with lengthened final
vowel) and therefore the phonological conditions for *-dh &gt; h are not met, because
the imperative “formed a whole with the following word” and “does not normally
stand in pausa” (p. 134). He also notes that gadhi “stands in the interior of a pāda” (p.
134), while gahi is overwhelmingly pāda-final, and that stuhi is also often pāda-final.
(I would add that, in addition to a number of initial stuhí, the pāda-internal examples
of stuhi never occupy the 4th-3rd position.)
I am in agreement with Lub that the metrical position of the form shows a
strong correlation with the -dhi vs. -hi alternate and also that kṛdhí and other forms in
ṛ are a special case (whatever the reason: I am not convinced that the older
pronounciation was [ər]), since the metrical distribution of kṛdhi tracks that of gahi
and other forms in -hi, not śrudhi and since a cluster * ər-dh- should produce a
metrically heavy syllable. He does, however, shift his explanatory ground for śrudhi
and company without signaling the change. For śrudhi the most important factor for
him at first appears to be the formulaic evidence, that it forms a phonological phrase
with hávam, that this phonological bonding is demonstrated by the lengthened final
vowel of the imperative, and that therefore the imperative was not really in pausa and
therefore not subject to the *dh &gt; h rule. But later in the same paragraph he seems to
argue that its position internal to the pāda, in contrast to pāda-final -hi forms like
stuhi and gahi, provides the conditioning and the formulaic argument is no longer
foremost. Although the śrudhī hávam formula is certainly pervasive, I would contend
that it is the metrical position, not the formation of a formulaic phonological phrase,
that is the key factor and, moreover, that the lengthening of the final vowel before
hávam (also gíraḥ) is the low-level result of metrical factors, to avoid four shorts in
the cadence. Certainly our gadhi is not formulaically or syntactically connected with
the word that follows it: … gadhi priyáḥ (“come, as dear one”). If we do want to
claim that bonding with a following element kept the -dhi from final position, it
would surely be better to focus on sequences involving enclitics (e.g. VIII.66.12 …
88
śrudhí me hávam), which would create a phonological word ending with the enclitic.
Unfortunately, such sequences are rare, compared to the śrudhī hávam type.
Pāda-internal position also appears to condition the occurrence of another -dhi
imperative, bodhi to √bhū, as I discussed some time ago (“Syntactic Constraints on
Morphological Change: The Vedic Imperatives bodhi, dehi, and dhehi,” in Syntaxe
des langues indo-iraniennes anciennes, ed. E. Pirart. Pp. 63–80, esp. 69–75.
Barcelona: Editorial Ausa, 1997). The parallel imperatives bodhi and bháva are
almost in complementary distribution, with bodhi once again standing internal in the
pāda and bháva either initial or final.
The last word has not been said about this complex issue.</p>
<h3 id="viii985">VIII.98.5</h3>
<p>As in the previous hymn (VIII.97.9c, 10a), this one deploys two forms of
the lexeme abhí √bhū ‘dominate’ to describe Indra – here 2a abhibhū́r asi and 5ab
abhí … babhū́tha – although the two hymns are ascribed to different poets from
different lineages.
As for the perfect form here, Kü (344–45) remarks that the perfect of √bhū,
both as simplex and with abhí and pári, is generally presential in value, and such a
value works well here. There is another issue with this perfect. This verse contains
the 2nd sg. babhū́tha without i-liaison, but 11b has babhū́vitha with the liaison. It is
striking to encounter both forms in the same hymn, esp. since, as Kü points out (344
n. 618), babhū́tha is the older, babhūvitha the younger form, found only once
elsewhere in the RV, while babhū́tha is quite common. Metrics must have
encouraged the use of younger babhū́vitha here, since it is final in a 12-syllable line,
where the older form would not fit. The other babhū́vitha (VIII.33.19) occurs in an
Anuṣṭubh cadence, where iambic rhythm is also favored. It is worth noting that
thirteen of the twenty-one occurrences of babhū́tha are final in Triṣṭubh lines, so the
insertion of the i-liaison simply converts this common cadential form into one
appropriate to Jagatī.</p>
<h3 id="viii987">VIII.98.7</h3>
<p>With Ge I take udā́in c as the acc. pl. neut. of udán-, rather than instr. sg.
to a root noun úd- with Gr, despite Old’s championing of the latter analysis and
explicit rejection of the former. See also AiG III.316 and Schindler (Das
Wurzelnomen im Arischen und Griechischen [unpubl. diss., Würzburg 1972], pp. 12–
13), which both affirm the nom.-acc. pl. -n-stem interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="viii988">VIII.98.8</h3>
<p>The simile vā́r ná … yavyā́bhiḥ is syntactically ambiguous, in that vā́r can
be the comparandum of either subject or object, though it probably makes better
sense as an object, as Ge takes it: (a body of) water growing with floods of
(tributary?) water. However, a nominative interpretation is by no means excluded, as
waters not infrequently swell things and make them grow; cf., e.g., I.65.4 várdhantīm
ā́paḥ … súśiśvim “The waters strengthen the lovely child.” For an overelaborate
interpretation see Oberlies (Relig. I.521).

<h3 id="viii989">VIII.98.9</h3>
<p>This verse may refer to the “Fallow-bay yoking libation,” which serves as
the occasion for the first-maṇḍala Indra hymns I.61–63, 82. However, this libation is
ordinarily the final act in a ritual, but is not final here.</p>

<h3 id="viii991">VIII.99.1</h3>
<p>The redupl. form ápīpyan is implicitly assigned by Ge to √pā ‘drink’ as a
redupl. (causative) aorist: “Dich haben … die … Männer getränkt,” an analysis I
follow. However, the majority opinion is that it belongs to √pī ‘swell’, which is not
out of the question. The competing claims and morphological possibilities are
discussed above ad VIII.66.7 with regard to apīpema. Our form here could have the
expected zero-grade to an athematic stem (ápīpy-an), and the long reduplication
could be correct for a causative reduplicated aorist, although since the cluster -py- is
undistracted here, a short reduplication might be expected (type AV atitrasan).
However, since most of the forms of the act. redupl. aorist paradigm would not have
such a cluster (*ápīpet, etc.), the long reduplication would surely be generalized. For
further disc. of the proposed formation see VIII.66.7.</p>
<h3 id="viii993">VIII.99.3</h3>
<p>The simile in the first pāda of this verse is quite problematic: not only is
the image intended quite unclear, but the verbal stem śrāya- in participial śrāyanta(ḥ)
(so Pp., Gr. rather śrāyante) is a near hapax (only here in the RV, other instances in
MS I.8.2, TĀr. IV.2.5 = ĀpŚS XV.3.7). Most tr. take it as transitive ‘cooking’ (so Ge,
e.g.); Old argues that sū́ryam should be the object: “like those cooking the sun, as it
were,” while Ge takes bhakṣata as the governing verb (“As [people] cooking use
[nutzen] the sun, they enjoy [geniessen] all [the goods] of Indra” – ‘nutzen’ and
‘geniessen’ must be his alternative tr. of abhakṣata depending on the object).
However, Narten (“Vedic śrīṇāti, gr. κρείων, κρέων,” KZ 100 [1987]: 270-96 = Kl
Sch 340-66, cited after latter) points out (p. 342 n. 3) that the stem is elsewhere
intrans. with the meaning ‘gar werden’ and tr. the hemistich “wie gar werdende (=
sich erhitzende) Leute (Anteil) an der Sonne (haben), so haben sie Anteil an allen
(Gütern) des Indra,” flg. a suggestion of Hoffmann’s. The TĀ=ĀpŚS passage
explicitly connects “getting done/cooked” with the sun: sūryasya harasā śrāya
“become cooked by the glow/heat of the sun.”
The Narten–Hoffmann interpretation is followed here, though I am still
somewhat puzzled both about the content of the simile and about its relevance to the
frame. For the first, getting cooked does not usually require the mediation of the sun
but rather of fire, so literally “having a share in the sun” at best ought to mean the
“share” of the sun that is actually fire. This is not terribly satisfactory, so, with
Narten we must therefore interpret “getting cooked” metaphorically (but not too
metaphorically), as indicating heated or excited people whose state is likened to
heating by the sun. But even with this interpretation of the simile, there seem far less
tortuous ways to indicate that people share in Indra’s goods than to compare this to
heated-up people sharing in the sun. However, the transitive interpretations do not
improve the sense: Old’s cooking the sun would require quite a lot of metaphor to
90
rescue it, and the same problem with Narten’s interpretation – that cooking doesn’t
require the sun – affects Ge’s transitive version.
The only reason I can see for the sun to make this distinctly odd appearance in
the simile of pāda a is to prepare us for its implicit appearance in the second
hemistich. With Ge I assume that the subject of the loc. absol. in c is the sun, which
is born every day, and whose “birth” at dawn sets the early morning ritual in motion,
the rite at which the dakṣiṇās are distributed. Ge suggests that jāté jánamāne is metri
causa for an āmreḍita jāté-jāte, but this seems unlikely. This is the only occurrence
of the middle participle to jána- and indeed one of the only middle forms of this rare
1st class pres. stem (most of the others are -anta 3rd plurals that are re-marked actives;
see Jamison &ldquo;Voice Fluctuation in the Rig Veda: Medial 3rd plural -anta in Active
Paradigms&rdquo;, IIJ 21 [1979] 146-69). I would hesitate to suppose that a Rigvedic poet
would create a new participial stem simply to avoid a metrical problem. Instead I
think he is making a temporal point: the sun has been born previous (jāté) and when
he is being born again, that is, at the moment the ritual commences, we think about
the goods that will come to us in the ritual.
Note that bhakṣata of the first hemistich is reprised by a nominal derivative of
√bhaj, bhāgám, in the second, and that the “goods” that need to be supplied in ab are
present as vásūni in c. This interdependence of the two half-verses supports the
notion that the sū́ryam of a is a pretaste of the unexpressed sun of c. The next
pragātha, vss. 5–6, may show the same covert interdependence; see disc. ad 5c.</p>

Ge renders the phrase aśastihā́janitā́as “der die Hohnreden niederschlägt und
hervorruft”; that is, he construes the 1st compound member aśasti- also with janitā́,
flg. Sāy’s gloss of janitā́as asurebhyo ‘śastīnāṃ janayitā, and also ascribes an
aberrant meaning to √jan, ‘call out, evoke’. It is certainly true that the normal value
of √jan, ‘beget’, seems somewhat out of place in this otherwise hostile context, but I
am reluctant to push both the syntax and the semantics as far as Ge’s interpretation
requires. I think rather that Indra’s general positive role as cosmic begetter is being
alluded to, in addition to his specific role as all-victorious dominator. In fact, the
paired verse in this pragātha may give us the clue. In 6ab Heaven and Earth (the
underlying referents of the dual kṣoṇī́) run after Indra “like two parents after their
child” (śíśuṃ ná mātárā), which reverses an image found elsewhere of Indra as the
begetter of Heaven and Earth, as in VIII.36.4 janitā́divó janitā́pṛthivyā́ḥ. In other
words, I think we should read janitā́in 5c pregnantly, as “begetter (of Heaven and
Earth)” in opposition to 6ab, where Indra is the child and Heaven and Earth the
parents. Alternatively, the pregnant usage might be “begetter (of all),” with viśvaborrowed from the first member of the following compound viśvatū́r. Watkins
(Dragon, 345) roughly follows the Ge interpretation, though with more persuasive
semantics: “you smash the un-song (for the loser) and engender (it for the winner)”;
presumably the parenthetic “it” should be not the “un-song,” but its de-negated
counterpart, śastí- ‘laud, praise’.
I tr. taruṣyant- as a pseudo-desiderative, contra Ge (Wettstreiter, sim. Gr).
The stem is a hapax, and its formation isn’t entirely clear. But the most orthodox way
to explain it is as a denominative to tárus-, ‘power/desire to overcome’; since
‘seeking’ is a standard sense associated with -yá-denominatives, a desiderative sense
is certainly possible.</p>
<h3 id="viii996">VIII.99.6</h3>
<p>Following Thieme (KZ 92 [1978] 46), kṣoṇi- is literally a ‘shout’ or ‘warcry’. But in the dual it evolves to refer to Heaven and Earth, presumably by way of
the long semantic chain ‘(two) opposing war-cries’ à ‘opponents’ à
complementary pair à the archetypal complementary pair, i.e. Heaven and Earth.
Though both duals, pitárā and mātárā, can refer to both parents, it is surely no
accident that in this tender image of childhood it’s literally “the two mothers” rather
than “the two fathers” who pursue the errant toddler.
With Gr and Old I read *śrathayanta for śnathayanta (√śnath ‘pierce’), flg.
Sāy and the Kashmir ms; see Old ad loc. Although Ge retains śnathayanta, in his
note he allows for the possibility of the variant reading. As Old points out, the
rhyming śnath form could have been introduced because of the mention of enemies.
92
VIII.99.7–8: The verb havāmahe of 8c must be read with both verses (so also Ge)
and is a mark of the unity of the pragātha. This pragātha is, furthermore, cunningly
constructed, with a number of rhetorical pairs: variants on “X and non-X” are found
in 7b prahetā́raṃ áprahitam and 8a iṣkartā́ram ániṣkṛtam, both pairs with the same
morphological structure; adjacent rhyming agent nouns jétāram and hétāram in 7c
join the other two agent nouns just cited, though with different accent; the negated
ppl. átūrtam in 7d (whose root links it to vss. 5–6) matches previously cited
áprahitam and ániṣkṛtam; there are several pairs of adjacent compounds with one
identical member: ániṣkṛtaṃ sáhaskṛtam (8a) and śatámūtiṃ śatákratum (8b), as well
as the pair vásavānaṃ vasūjúvam (8d) with the first an -āna-formation built to vasuwith full-grade of the suffix (for which type see AiG II.2.275); and the second
member of śatám-ūtim (8b) picks up ūtī́(7a), whatever the source of the latter (see
below). It may also be that the sequence in 7c … jétāraṃ hétāraṃ rathī́tamam
playfully evokes a sequence of two comparatives in -tara- culminating in a
superlative.
The phrase itá ūtī́(also, as itá ūtī́ḥ I.119.8, I.130.5) cannot be separated from
the compound itáūti- (6x). The latter has an apparent Old Avestan cognate utaiiūiti-
‘youthfulness’, probably containing a *yūti- related to yúvan- ‘youth’. The Vedic
compound clearly lost its transparency and has undergone some deformation,
resulting, finally, in the folk-etymology “help from here / from then on” represented
by the phrasal itá ūtí-. Both the compound and the phrase can co-occur with ajára-
‘unaging’ as here; see also I.146.2, X.31.7. For disc. and lit. see EWA s.v. itáūti-.
Here in this Anhangslied it is likely that ūtí- ‘help’ has captured the de-compounded
phrase, but that the phrase is still associated with the notion of constancy, hence my
compromise “with enduring help.” Ge tr. “zu eurem unmittelbaren (immediate)
Beistand,” but in n. allows “den durch Fortdauer (oder Verjüngung) Alterlosen.”</p>
<h3 id="viii100">VIII.100</h3>
<p>Indra
On the hymn in general see the publ. intro., as well as Old (Noten ad loc. and
&ldquo;Indra, Vāyu, der Vrtrakampf ̥ und die Erschaffung der Sprache” [pp. 54–60 in
“Ākhyāna Hymnen im Ṛigveda,” ZDMG 39 (1885): 52–90 = KlSch. 474–512]) and
Ge’s long and rather despairing intro.
VIII.100.1–2: As I argue in the publ. intro., the heavy emphasis on Indra’s
designating a portion of soma at the beginning of the sacrifice for “you,” the speaker
of vs. 1, points strongly at Vāyu as this speaker, rather than Viṣṇu, as Ge suggests.
Old also considers it an Indra-Vāyu dialogue.</p>
<h3 id="viii1001">VIII.100.1</h3>
<p>I take dī́dharaḥ as the subjunctive of the redupl. aor., whose indicative
forms are generally athematic (dīdhar, etc., though cf. augmented thematic ádīdharat
in the very late hymn X.173.3). The sequence yadā́… dī́dharaḥ …, ā́d íd … kṛṇavaḥ
with aorist subjunctive in the protasis and present subjunctive in the apodosis seems
a rough-and-ready attempt to express anteriority (“when you will [have] …, only
93
after that will you …”) in a language that does not, as far as I can see, have either a
formalized system of sequence of tense in conditionals or a standard way to express
anteriority with finite verb forms (as opposed to participles and, somewhat later, the
gerund).</p>
<h3 id="viii1002">VIII.100.2</h3>
<p>Ge (followed by Klein, DGRV I.242, II.108) takes pāda c as a
subordinated conditional clause with d, with the subordination marked by ca (i.e., “if
you will be my comrade, then we will …”). This is certainly possible, but it is
impossible to tell formally if c is subordinated to d or coordinated with b (as I take it)
because the accent on the verb ásaḥ can result from its initial position. Perhaps in
favor of the Ge/Klein interpretation is the fact that both c and d contain subjunctives,
while b has an imperative. On the other hand, in a related passage (also adduced by
Ge), the two expressions are parallel, not in a subordinate/main clause relation:
X.83.7 … dakṣiṇató bhavā me, ádhā vṛtrā́ṇi jaṅghanāva bhū́ri “Be on my right side.
Then we two will keep smiting obstacles in abundance.”</p>
<h3 id="viii1003">VIII.100.3</h3>
<p>Despite the gender, I take the second satyám in pāda b as equated with
Indra, contrary to Ge, who interprets it implicitly as referring to the true praise
(stómam … satyám) earlier in the hemistich or to truth in general: “… ein Loblied …,
ein wahrhaftes, wenn es Wahrheit ist.” Lüders (Varuṇa, 639) argues convincingly
that the second hemistich supports the reference of the conditional clause in b, yádi
satyám ásti, to Indra and tr. “wenn er wirklich ist” (somewhat different tr. p. 566).</p>
<h3 id="viii1004-1">VIII.100.4</h3>
<p>Indra clearly announces his epiphany, after the doubts expressed in vs. 3.
The opening ayám asmi echoes the opening words of the hymn (1a) ayáṃ ta
emi.
víśvā jātā́ny abhy àsmi is reminiscent of vs. 5 in the preceding hymn,
VIII.99.5b abhí víśvā asi spṛ́dhaḥ, and belongs to the formula abhí √bhū/as found in
this group of hymns. See disc. add VIII.99.5.
On ṛtásya … pradíśaḥ see Lü (Varuṇa, 566–67), who considers them to be
Lieder.
The duplication of intensive forms in nominal ādardiráḥ … dardarīmi is
taken by Ge (also Lü, 566–67) as merely an etymological figure (esp. clear in Lü’s
“zerschmetternd zerschmettere ich…”). This is of course possible, but I wonder if the
preverb of the nominal form does not signal more. The lexeme ā́√dṛ is often used
for breaking open cowpens and tearing out the cattle, esp. in the Vala myth (cf., e.g.,
III.30.21), and so Indra may be not only announcing his current actions but also
alluding to his regular mythological role as opener of the Vala cave full of cows.</p>
<h3 id="viii1005">VIII.100.5</h3>
<p>For my view of the complexities of the participants in this verse, see the
publ. intro. I take the speaker to be Indra, the immediate addressee to be the singer
(speaker of vs. 3), and the addressees of the speech recounted in pāda d to be the
Maruts.
94
One of the first difficulties in this verse is the perennial mystery word vená-,
which I render ‘tracker, seeker’. The word is esp. associated with X.123, to which
the Anukramaṇī assigns Vena as both poet and deity. There vená- is singular, not
plural as here. In the singular Vena appears to be identified with the sun and/or
Soma; in the plural (see esp. IX.85.10–11) the word often seems to refer to poets or
their hymns. That seems to be the case here: the trackers of truth are poets or their
products, then probably further identified with the Maruts, who are also the referents
of sákhāyaḥ in pāda d, in my view. The use of vená- to refer both to the deity and
his/its praisers presumably rests in part on the reciprocal relationship between them
and also perhaps on the notion that just as the deity is sought by those below him, so
he also is pursuing something higher.
Both in the singular and the plural vená- is associated with heights. Here the
trackers “mounted” (áruhan) to Indra; cf. the same root in I.56.2 giríṃ ná venā́ádhi
roha téjasā. The heights are indicated in various ways. In IX.85.9-10 a bull mounts
heaven and then the Venas milk him, who is standing on a mountain (giriṣṭhā́m) in
the vault of heaven (divó nā́ke), and this vault is mentioned in the remaining two
verses of the Vena section of this hymn (IX.85.11–12). The vault recurs in the Vena
hymn (X.123.6, 7), probably also as “the highest distant heaven” (paramé vyòman
5b), and there are other indications of a high position: some female figures bestride
“the back of truth” (ṛtásya sā́nau 3c, also 2c) while poets mount on the stream
(síndhum 4c). In particular in X.123.2b we find the same phrase pṛṣṭháṃ haryatásya
“the back of the delightful one” as in our 5b, where Indra is seated thereon.
The question is who or what is the “delightful one.” Ge supplies “heaven,” Lü
(567) simply tr. haryatásya as “Himmel,” and Old (1885: 56–57) as “Weltall.” I am
dubious about this rendering; although diváḥ is found with pṛṣṭhá- on a number of
occasions, haryatá- never qualifies ‘heaven’, but is regularly used of soma, and in
fact in X.123.2 Ge thinks that soma is the referent. However, it is perhaps difficult to
imagine Indra sitting on soma’s (or Soma’s) back (such is apparently Ge’s objection
in his n.), and so it is possible that this is a reference to one of Indra’s fallow bay
horses hári-. In V.61.2 pṛṣṭhé sádaḥ “the seat on the back” refers to the Maruts’ seat
on the back of their horses. Hence the tentative bracketed identifications in the publ.
tr. “[=fallow bay / soma?].” Perhaps best is to combine these two possibilities – the
real referent is soma, as signalled by haryatá-, but since sitting on a liquid is hard to
envision, the soma is made conceptually solid by configuring it as a horse, mediated
through the common use of the color term hári- for soma; cf., e.g., IX.65.25 haryató
háriḥ.
In c the Pp. reads dat. hṛdé, followed by Ge., but I prefer the ablative since
hṛdá ā́with underlying ablative is an idiom and used in similar contexts with verbs
of speaking (cf. II.35.2 imáṃ sv àsmai hṛdá ā́sútaṣṭam, mántraṃ vocema … “This
well-crafted spell we would speak to him from our heart”).
The possessive adj. śíśumantaḥ appears to introduce a child or children that
seem to have no place here. I follow Lü’s (567 n. 3) idea that the -mant- suffix
functions here as the neut. sg. -vát sometimes does, as a simile marker “my comrades
like children,” not “my comrades along with their children.” The -mant- for -vant-
95
would of course be by rule after a stem ending in -u-. Considerably more problematic
is the precise form: ordinarily these -vant- simile forms are adverbial neuters and
show accent shift to the suffix, so -vát (e.g., manuṣvát ‘like Manu’, jamadagnivát
‘like Jamadagni’). Here we have a case form (nom. pl.) and no accent shift. However,
Whitney (§1233f) allows for a sense ‘like to, resembling’ for some -vant-stems, and
therefore, though Lü’s interpretation may be a bit over-tricky, I follow it since I think
it gives better sense. Support for this interpretation is found in the parallel IX.74.1
śíśur ná … cakradat “like a child he has cried out” with a verb built to the same stem
as in our passage ácikradañ chíśumantaḥ …</p>
<h3 id="viii1006">VIII.100.6</h3>
<p>Here the singer of vs. 3 seems to be convinced by Indra’s assertions in
vss. 4–5 and promises a proper recital of Indra’s deeds, in contrast to the conditional
praise of vs. 3.
I take pā́rāvatam in c as a vṛddhi adjective derived from parāvát- ‘distance’,
rather than as a PN as Ge does (flg. Sāy, followed tentatively by Mayrhofer,
Personennamen s.v.). As an adj. it works nicely with purusambhṛtám ‘brought
together by many’, and there is no other mention of human opponents in this hymn.
VIII.100.7–9: I take these three Anuṣṭubh verses as the singer’s performance of the
recital of deeds promised in 6ab, but cast in the language of dramatic immediacy –
almost “you are there” – with the singer himself as the supposed witness, addressing
the waters in 7ab. Ge (in his intro.) also seems to assign the verses to the singer,
while Old (1885: 57 n. 2) refuses to speculate.</p>
<h3 id="viii1008">VIII.100.8</h3>
<p>The stealing of the soma treated here logically precedes the outcome of
the Vṛtra battle treated in 7 and 9, since Indra needed to drink the soma in order to
fight Vṛtra, as is well known. I suggest that the theft is intercalated here, between two
hemistichs about the vájra- (7cd, 9ab), not only because Rigvedic narratives are
famously shattered chronologically, but also to play a trick. The vajrá- was let fly (a
in 7d (apīpatat); in the next half-verse (8ab) the unspecified subject goes at the speed
of thought. The default assumption would be that it is the flying mace, but cd
disappoints our expectations by introducing the bird and the familiar soma-theft.</p>
<h3 id="viii1009">VIII.100.9</h3>
<p>The poet now plays another trick. The first pāda “within the sea he/it lies”
(samudré antáḥ śayate) returns us to the Vṛtra myth and, we would think, to Vṛtra,
who, in the most famous treatment of the myth, I.32, lies (√śi, Vṛtra’s signature verb
there) submerged in water after his smiting (e.g., I.32.8 … amuyā́śáyānam … áti
yanty ā́paḥ “The waters go across him lying in that way”). Here we have both the
signature verb and the water – but it’s the vájra that is lying in the water, not Vṛtra,
as we discover in the next pāda. Moreover, in that pāda the mace is ‘covered’
(abhī́vṛtaḥ) with water, using the same root (at least synchronically, whatever its
source) as the transitive verb expressing Vṛtra’s obstruction of the waters in 7b
(ávīvarīt). Both forms of course also evoke Vṛtra himself, “obstruction” embodied.
As far as I know, this image of the submerged mace receiving tribute from the waters
96
is found nowhere else in the Vṛtra myth complex, and seems to have been invented
here for the purpose of verbal trickery.
VIII.100.10–11: For the possible mythological background of these verses, as
adumbrated by Old, see the publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="viii10010">VIII.100.10</h3>
<p>Ge is understandably reluctant to construe avicetanā́ni with vádantī,
since this attributes unintelligible speech to Speech herself, but his solution, to
construe the neut. pl. loosely with niṣasā́da (“… sich bei den unvernünftigen
(Geschöpfen) niederliess”), does not work syntactically. Old’s mythological
explanation is preferable.</p>
<h3 id="viii10012">VIII.100.12</h3>
<p>For my hypothesis about the relevance of this verse to the rest of the
hymn see the publ. intro. The verse is consciously modeled on vs. 2: the voc. sákhe
in a picks up sákhā of 2c; hánāva vṛtrám in c echoes vṛtrā́ṇi jaṅghanāva bhū́ri. But,
at least in my view and Old’s (though not Ge’s), the two addressees are not the same:
Vāyu in 2 and Viṣṇu in 12. As I argued in the publ. intro. Viṣṇu may have been
introduced here because his association with three may allow him to represent the
Third Pressing in this hymn-length sketch of the ritual day. And, also presented in
the intro., the apparent superimposition of Viṣṇu on Vāyu via the close similiarity of
vss. 2 and 12 may have been an attempt to integrate the newly ascendant god Viṣṇu
into the older inherited religion in which Vāyu is prominent.</p>
<h3 id="viii101-1">VIII.101</h3>
<p>Various gods</p>
<h3 id="viii1011">VIII.101.1</h3>
<p>The first word of the hymn, ṛ́dhak ‘separately, one by one’, may be
stationed there to indicate that the hymn (or hymn collection; see publ. intro.) to
follow praises a number of gods individually, who collectively are summed up in
devátātaye ‘for the conclave of the gods’ at the end of the same hemistich.</p>
<h3 id="viii1012">VIII.101.2</h3>
<p>The abstract bāhútā- ‘arm-ness’ or ‘collectivity of arms’ occurs twice in
the RV (otherwise in I.41.2). I think it must refer to the quintessential qualify of arms,
namely strength (see bāhv-òjas- ‘having the strength of arms, armstrong’). Here, in
the simile I think the point is that Mitra and Varuṇa guide the chariot with their
supernatural skill (daṃsánā) as if with physical arms, the tools that less exalted
charioteers would use. The arms of the two gods are found in the next pragātha, 4d.</p>
<h3 id="viii1014">VIII.101.4</h3>
<p>I take tásmāt as referring to the unnamed weapon, coreferential with yáḥ
in the rel. cl., and ascribe its ablative form to case attraction to infinitival sámṛteḥ.
The weapon is probably the śáru- ‘arrow’ associated with the Ādityas in VIII.18.11,
67.15, 20, as Ge notes. It might therefore have been better to tr. yáḥ in pāda a as
‘which one’ not the animatized ‘who’.
97</p>
<h3 id="viii1015">VIII.101.5</h3>
<p>This verse contains two minor disharmonies: 1) the recipients of the
praise song are in the dat. in pāda a (mitrā́ya … aryamṇé) but the loc. in cd (váruṇe
… rā́jasu); 2) the verb is 2nd plural (prá … gāyata) but paired with a vocative in the
singular, the hapax ṛtāvasaḥ. Ge separates the vs. into abc and d, supplying a verb
(“(trage) … vor”) with the former. This solves the number problem, by isolating the
plural verb in a separate clause, but not the case problem. Moreover, since the hymn
is composed in pragāthas, I would prefer to construe the doubled prá in a with the
impv. gāyata in d, for a meta-pun on the name of the verse pairing. Chopping the
verse into two clauses is not appealing, particularly since it only addresses one of the
disharmonies, in my opinion the lesser one.
As for ṛtāvaso, Re suggests that ṛtāvasu [sic] is a simple variant of ṛtā́van- (or,
better formulated, voc. ṛtāvaso is a simple variant of voc. ṛtāvaḥ (/-vo) to the stem
ṛtā́van-). This seems somewhat convincing. As a 2nd member of bahuvrīhis of the
shape X-vasu-, the noun vásu- can become semantically bleached, from ‘having X as
goods’ to ‘rich in X’ and even further to just ‘having X’. Cf. the pair vibhā́van- /
vibhā́vasu-. The Vedic voc. in -vas to -van-stems makes the singular vocatives even
more similar; to the just-cited pair, compare vibhāvo [before vd. sounds] and
vibhāvaso, with the latter offering a convenient way to generate a Jagatī/iambic
cadence from a Triṣṭubh. This does not solve our number problem, however; it is
unfortunately altogether too artificial to suggest that a singular vocative to the -vanstem, ṛtāvaḥ (&lt;-vas), was reinterpreted as belonging to a real s-stem and a plural voc.
in *-vasas (/-vaso) was built to it. The existence of clearly singular vibhā-vaso (4x)
beside singular vibhāvo (1x) shows that the morphology was still intact. I would
point out, however, that there is no way to produce a plural voc. to either the -vanstem or the -vasu- stem that will fit in a cadence, either Triṣṭubh or Jagatī: ṛtāvānaḥ
and ṛtāvasavaḥ are both out. It is therefore possible that the hapax ṛtāvaso was a
quick-and-dirty fix for the metrical problem. Or else it represents the not rare
situation of a poet addressing himself in the singular but his fellow singers in the
plural. I would also point out that vásu occurs pāda-final in the next verse (6a) and du.
voc. vājinīvasū pāda-final in 8b. Ge, by the way, tr. ṛtāvaso as a PN (though allowing
for the lexical value in his n.); this doesn’t help one way or the other and can, I think,
be dismissed.
I do not understand the change in case from dat. to loc. either. The verb √gā
(+/- prá) elsewhere takes only dat., never loc., as far as I know. It might be possible
to take the locatives as functionally different from the datives &ndash; “chez or bei Varuṇa
(and) the kings.” But since Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman are an almost inseparable
trio and Mitra and Aryaman are in the dative in pāda a, it is highly unlikely that
Varuṇa would be functionally separate from them in this verse. And it is insulting to
the grammatical knowledge of our poet even to suggest that váruṇe owes its ending
to a superficial matching with aryamṇé two pādas before, particularly since rā́jasu
with a non-rhyming loc. ending follows soon after. I think the poet changed cases
just because he thought he could and craved a bit of novelty. For another tricky
problem of case, see 8ab below.
98</p>
<h3 id="viii1016">VIII.101.6</h3>
<p>The identity of the three mothers of Agni, the likely referent of the acc.
phrases in ab, isn’t clear. Ge suggests the three Opfergöttinen (Iḍā, Sarasvatī,
Bharatī) of the Āprī hymns. Agni is called trimātár- in III.56.5, but the three are not
identified there either. Since our vs. is the 2nd vs. in a pragātha whose 1st vs. concerns
the Ādityas, esp. Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman, I am inclined to think that these three
male deities have been slotted into the “three mothers” role just here because of the
coincidence of the numbers.
The Pp reads masc. nom. pl. amṛ́tāḥ in c, and Ge so tr. (“Die unbetörten
Unsterblichen beobachten das Tun der Sterblichen”). Against the Pp I take it as neut.
pl. amṛ́tā; the sandhi situation allows either, of course. Ge’s tr. assumes that the
dhā́māni belong to mortals, but wherever it&rsquo;s possible to tell, dhā́man- is something
belonging to gods. Cf. also III.55.10 dhā́māni amṛ́tā.</p>
<h3 id="viii1018">VIII.101.8</h3>
<p>The apparent doubling of the du. pronouns vām … yuvā́bhyām is
complicated by the fact that at least the second one violates the usual case frame of
the verb. Pāda a contains the verb hávāmahe and an undoubted acc. obj., the
inanimate rātím ‘giving’, as well as an animate pronoun vām, which could be acc.,
gen., or dat. This 2nd du enclitic is matched by tonic 2nd du yuvā́bhyām in pāda b,
which can be instr. or dat. (Note in passing that Macdonell [VGS, p. 105; VG p. 300]
only allows instr. for this form, but there is at least one undoubted dat. example
elsewhere, I.109.4, as well as several of nearly identical yuvábhyām. Cf. AiG III.464,
which points out that the older instr. form was yuvā́, which is preserved in cmpds like
yuvā́-datta.)
The only case intersection between vām and yuvā́bhyām is dative, but there is
no standard case-frame idiom with √hvā with the structure “call for (s.o. dat.) for
(s.th. acc).” Gr classifies the passage under his no. 8, “etwas [A] erbitten,” thus
eliding the pronoun(s) entirely under this rubric, though in the lemma he cites it as
rātím vām, including the enclitic but not the more intractable tonic form. Ge. takes
vām as gen., and declares in his n. 8ab that yuvā́bhyām is also “in Sinn des Gen.,”
which would be convenient but is remarkably cavalier about morphology. A further
complication is that pāda b is a repeated pāda (=VIII.5.3 &ndash; not registered in
Bloomfield’s Rig-Veda Repetitions). The case value of yuvā́bhyām in VIII.5.3 isn’t
entirely clear, but the context is probably compatible with a dative, but not with
either instr. or gen. &ndash; an acc. might be the best.
I confess I don’t entirely know what to make of this. There are no standard
uses of √hvā that take a personal dative, though inanimate datives abound. I am
inclined to take pāda a as containing a double acc. (with vām in acc. function): “call
you two for giving.” The yuvā́bhyām in the next pāda could be the result of repeating
this short pāda from elsewhere without integrating it into the syntactic frame of the
rest, or show the case variation (what we might call “case creep”) observed also in vs.
5, with the poet inventing an idiom “call for s.o. (dat.)” based on other verbs of
speaking, like √vac, which can take either acc. or dat. of the addressee.

Another slight oddity in the first pāda is the characterization of the gods’
giving as arakṣás- ‘undemonic’. I have softened this somewhat to ‘without animus’;
Ge tr. ‘ohne Falsch’, which seems more distant from the literal sense of the stem.</p>
<h3 id="viii1019">VIII.101.9</h3>
<p>With Gr I take sumánmabhiḥ as a bahuvrīhi, contra Ge’s karmadhāraya
“mit guten Gedanken” (though he allows the other alternative in n. 9b). This stem is
attested in the nom. sg. masc. in VII.68.9 and therefore must be a bahuvrīhi, since
mánman- is neut., and the parallel durmánas- (2x) is found only in the masc. and so
must be a bahuvrīhi as well.
Against Ge, I take the second hemistich as referring to two different soma
drinks, the one mixed with milk in c, the pure one in d. The offering of two types of
soma is made clear in 10cd; note esp. the ‘both’ of c, ubháyasya naḥ piba “drink of
both of ours,” which is immediately followed by the definitional d, śúciṃ [matching
śukráḥ in our 9d] sómaṃ gávāśiram [matching śrīṇānáḥ in our 9c] “the pure soma
(and) the one mixed with milk.” In 9c the present participle śrīṇānáḥ “is being mixed”
(my italics) makes it clear that it is not yet ready to be offered, whereas the pure
soma (in d) has just that moment been offered, as the passive aor. ayāmi indicates.
This reflects the ritual procedure whereby Vāyu is first offered pure soma.
Assuming that my separation of c and d is correct, this adds another ex. of a
predicated non-past participle to the dossier.
Note the phonetic figure ayám … ayāmi.
VIII.101.11–12: As noted in the publ. intro., the banality of these vss. is a surprising
aberration in RVic style. I will note that pāda-final mahā́m̐asi “you are great,” found
5x in these two vss. (once mid-pāda), is something of a signature of the late VIIIth
Maṇḍala (60.6, 19; 64.2, 95.4, 98.2), though it&rsquo;s found occasionally elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="viii10112">VIII.101.12</h3>
<p>Presumably the sun’s light is ‘undeceivable’ (adābhyàm) because the
sun is witness to everything.</p>
<h3 id="viii10113">VIII.101.13</h3>
<p>The referent of the fem. sgs. in this vs. is not entirely clear. Ge
interprets it as the offering spoon or the butter offering, Old as the cow. I think Ge’s
2nd alternative is correct, with ā́huti- or a similar fem. noun as the word underlying.
Pāda b, “her form is created by a/the ruddy (cow),” because butter is a milk product.
(Ge supplies ‘flame’ rather than ‘cow’ with róhiṇyā, but róhiṇī- elsewhere refers to
cows [see nearby VIII.93.13].) Pāda c is more or less VII.81.1a práty u adarśy āyatī́,
and since the referent there is Dawn, the simile citréva (i.e., citrā́iva) must be
comparing the bright butter offering (bright because it is whitish yellow or because it
makes the fire brighter) to Dawn. As for the ten arms, Old and Ge both suggest that
these are the arms of the five Adhvaryus. However, it seems possible to me that
we’re dealing with body-part inflation, and the ten “arms” are the ten fingers (of a
single priest) regularly referred to in ritual contexts.
100</p>
<h3 id="viii10114">VIII.101.14</h3>
<p>This difficult and enigmatic vs. is found in slightly variant form in the
AV in the mystical skambha hymn X.8.3, is repeated in other Vedic texts, and
receives an explanation in ŚB II.5.1.4–5. The interpr. of the verse in this context here
has been influenced by its later deployments, esp. the ŚB exegesis — in my opinion
misleadingly. The ŚB takes it to refer to the passing of generations or races,
expressed by the prajā́ḥ … tisráḥ of pāda a, and this basic understanding is
reproduced by Ge and by Re (Hymnes spéculatifs 165, though of AV X.8.3, not the
RVic passage). Old sensibly disdains tr. and explanation (“Erklärung dieser Mystik
versuche ich nicht.”).
I think the vs. must be taken within its RVic context, which is ritualistic; it is
paired in its pragātha with vs. 13, a depiction of the butter offering. Although in the
first 3 pādas the wording is obscure, the final pāda seems to suggest the solution to
the mystery, in that its first word pávamānaḥ ‘self-purifying’ can hardly refer to
anything but soma. (It is probably not an accident that in the reuse of this verse in the
AV pāda d is quite different [hárito háriṇīr ā́viveśa] and does not contain the telltale
word.) The identity of the harítaḥ is less secure. In the publ. tr. I follow Ge in supply
‘flames’, but this is ritually problematic: soma doesn’t seem to be offered into the
fire. Maṇḍala IX twice refers to haríto dáśa “ten tawny ones” (IX.63.9, 69.9), which
appear to be the fingers of the ritual officiant. I would now emend the translation to
“has entered within the tawny (fingers),” pointing out that “with the ten arms” of 13d
may refer to the same phenomenon.
Guided by the clinching word pávamānaḥ in pāda d, an interpr. grounded in
soma ritual fits pāda a very well. The most important clue is the compound VP
atyā́yam īyuḥ “have made their traversal”; the lexeme áti √i ‘go across’ is regularly
used of soma’s trip across the filter (IX.85.9 pávitram áty eti, etc.). The three prajā́ḥ
can be the three soma pressings (or perhaps the soma for the first three soma cups);
soma drinks are called prajā́divyásya rétasaḥ “the offspring of the heavenly semen”
in IX.86.28, a hymn that contains several passages (IX.86.14, 39, 45) in which soma
is “fitted into among the worlds/creatures” (bhúvaneṣv árpitaḥ), similarly to our pāda
c bhúvaneṣv antáḥ.
The relevance of pāda b to the soma theme is less clear to me. By my rules,
anyā́ḥ should be definite “the others” (contrary to the standard rendering “others”)
and contrastive to the three offspring of pāda a. I am not sure what “the others”
would be (though presumably some other set of soma drinks), nor what “settling
down around the chant” would involve. As for pāda c, I’ve already pointed out
soma’s position bhúvaneṣu elsewhere, and the towering quality of cosmic soma is
also emphasized elsewhere.
I do not feel I have solved all the problems with this verse, but the lexical
clues of pādas a and d seem to me to anchor it in a soma context, with this ritual
context reinforced by its pragātha twin.</p>
<h3 id="viii10115">VIII.101.15</h3>
<p>Note the phonetic figure in pāda d mā́gā́m (á)nāgām.
101</p>
<h3 id="viii10116">VIII.101.16</h3>
<p>According to the transmitted text, this hymn ends on a downbeat: the
small-witted man (dabhrácetāḥ), the last word of the hymn, has taken possession
(avṛkta) of the cow that has been so extravagantly praised in vss. 15–16, whose right
to safety was proclaimed to “observant people” or “the observant man” (cikitúṣe
jánāya 15c), the opposite of the small-witted man of 16d. This sad finale seems
unlikely to me, and a small emendation to the text will change the tone entirely.
Instead of ā́māvṛkta at the beginning of pāda d, I suggest reading *mā́mā vṛkta. The
second part, mā vṛkta, instead of the Pp. mā avṛkta, does not alter the Saṃhitā text.
As for reading the prohibitive negative mā́for preverb ā́, note that the preceding
pāda ends with gā́m, and in the sequence … gā́m mā́the pāda-spanning -m m- could
well have been degeminated. The posited *mā́may or may not also contain the
preverb ā́. Since √vṛj generally appears with a preverb, it probably does. Restoring
*mā́also makes the pāda more parallel to 15d mā́gā́m …, which also contains a mā́
prohibitive with a cow as obj.</p>
<h3 id="viii102-1">VIII.102</h3>
<p>Agni</p>
<h3 id="viii1022">VIII.102.2</h3>
<p>The standard interpr. are agreed that the referent of the fem. instr. phrase
ī́ḷānayā … duvasyúvā is some form of speech. This makes sense and is certainly not
excluded. However, the only other fem. form of the participle ī́ḷāna- in V.28.1 refers
to the ghee-filled offering ladle, and I therefore prefer that interpr.</p>
<h3 id="viii1027">VIII.102.7</h3>
<p>This vs. consists of two ungoverned sentence fragments, both referring to
Agni: an accusative phrase in ab, a dative phrase in c. The former could continue the
syntax of the preceding vss., although the intervening tṛca boundary makes some
difficulties. The dative phrase is entirely untethered except that it adjoins áchā,
which ordinarily takes the accusative, and the next vs. makes a fresh syntactic start
with Agni in the nominative. Ge suggests that there are two Agnis in question in this
verse, but this seems to be overthinking it. I think we’re dealing with two false starts,
with the first perhaps simply carrying on from the previous vs.</p>
<h3 id="viii1028">VIII.102.8</h3>
<p>The lexeme ā́√bhū generally means ‘stand by, be at hand’; this works
fine for pāda a, but not so well for pāda b. Neither Ge’s “eingehe … in” nor Re’s
“s&rsquo;intègre à” seems to work any better.</p>
<h3 id="viii10211">VIII.102.11</h3>
<p>My construction of this vs. follows Ge’s. Re by contrast takes b as a
nominal rel. clause and c as the main clause. Since the verb dīdā́ya is initial in its
pāda and, as a main-clause verb, could owe its accent to this position, there is no way
to tell and no semantic implications. In slight favor of Ge is the fact that √dī is
frequently construed with the loc., as it would be with dámeṣu ā́in b.</p>
<h3 id="viii10213">VIII.102.13</h3>
<p>The standard interpr. take jāmáyo gíraḥ as a nominative NP (Ge “die
verschwisterten Lobreden”), modified by the intens. part. dédiśatīḥ. Although I see
the advantages of this, it leaves the participle with little to do (Ge “die dich
102
herausstreichen,” Re “indiquant avec force (leur intention),” Scar (82) “die immer
wieder auf dich hinweisen”). I separate gíraḥ from jāmáyaḥ and take it as the acc. obj.
of the intens. participle. The question then is the referent of jāmáyaḥ ‘kindred,
siblings’. I tentatively suggest it is the waters, who appear in the next vs. as ritual
actors. The waters are called jāmí- elsewhere (I.23.16). Because waters are always
gurgling, they can be considered to be the deliverers of hymns.</p>
<h3 id="viii10214">VIII.102.14</h3>
<p>I don’t really understand this verse, but it seems to conjoin technical
ritual references with an allusion to the myth of Agni’s flight and his concealment in
the waters &ndash; and these two interpretive strains are somewhat at cross purposes.
According to the śrauta sūtras, the darbha grass, that is, the barhis, is gathered into
three or more bundles (cf., e.g., MŚS I.1.1.42, ĀpŚS I.4.10, BŚS I.2) in preparation
for the sacrifice; hence pādas ab seem to depict a situation in which the preliminaries
for the sacrifice have not been performed. This may well be because Agni has fled
and so the regular ritual procedures have not been carried out. In c the waters in
which Agni hides are said to have set down/deposited his footprint; in other words
they have established him within themselves to hide him. Agni is regularly the obj. of
ní √dhā; for his pádam being set down, see VIII.72.19, III.7.7, I.72.6, etc., and for ní
√dhā in the context of Agni’s concealment X.32.6a nidhīyámānam ápagūḷham apsú.
But in ritual context the water’s setting down Agni’s footprint may refer to the
sprinkling of the fire with water after it has been surrounded by barhis (see Ge’s n.
14c and Hillebrandt, Rit. Lit. 110), and therefore from a ritual point of view the
preparations are proceeding smoothly. The next verse gives support to this
alternative.</p>
<h3 id="viii10216">VIII.102.16</h3>
<p>Although the other occurrence of the med. part. tepāná- (VIII.60.19) is
transitive, a passive interpr. works better here.
The gen. ghṛtásya is best construed with dhītíbhiḥ “with visions/thoughts of
ghee.” Both Ge and Old suggest that this refers to what we would now call “virtual
ghee,” not the real physical substance &ndash; anticipating the purely mental sacrifice of
the last tṛca (19–21). But this tṛca (vss. 16–18) seems otherwise to depict a more
standard ritual, and I think it more likely that “with visions of ghee” is a shorthand
way of referring both to the physical stimulus of Agni’s flame, namely melted butter,
and the mental one, the hymns accompanying the libation.</p>
<h3 id="viii10217">VIII.102.17</h3>
<p>It is not clear who the mothers are and whether they are, with Sāy,
identified with the gods mentioned in pāda b. Re’s “(tels) des mères” seems to follow
this interpr., but in his n. he suggests that the mothers are the waters. The mention of
the waters in vs. 14 might support this latter alternative, but given the “three
(mothers)” of Agni in the preceding hymn, VIII.101.6, which I take to be the (male)
gods Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman (see comm. ad loc.), I am inclined towards Sāy’s
interpr., though it is not clearly reflected in my publ. tr.
VIII.102.19–22: See publ. intro. for my general interpr. of these verses.

<h3 id="viii103-1">VIII.103</h3>
<p>Agni</p>
<h3 id="viii1032">VIII.103.2</h3>
<p>Ge takes the verb of ab to be prá … tasthau, with the tasthau long
postponed to pāda d and pāda c (which has its own verb) parenthetical. This seems
too fussy. It is perfectly easy to supply a verb of motion with prá in a (so also Re, Kü
464).
VIII.103.3–4: In both these vss. tmánā ‘by himself’ contrasts with the vast number
(thousands) that the action of this sole individual wins or prospers.</p>
<h3 id="viii1035">VIII.103.5</h3>
<p>HvN split the hemistich between vā́jam and árvatā, producing two pādas
of 11 syllables each. But since the b pāda then has a bad cadence and since the pāda,
minus initial árvatā, is found also at I.40.4, where the iambic cadence is fine in a
dimeter line, it seems best to follow the standard view that árvatā belongs with pāda
a, which is then hypermetric (so Old).
The famous formula “imperishable fame” (ákṣiti śrávaḥ) ends the second
pāda.</p>
<h3 id="viii1037">VIII.103.7</h3>
<p>Ge/Re take rathyàm as an adjective with áśvam in the simile (e.g., Ge
“Wie ein Wagenross …”). This is possible, if it is derived from the thematic stem
rathyà-, rather than rathī́-, where Gr classifies it. However, the interposition of
gīrbhíḥ distances it from the simile, and I prefer to take it as the acc. of rathī́-
‘charioteer’. Agni is often called the charioteer of the sacrifice (etc.), e.g., I.44.2 ágne
rathī́r adhvarā́ṇām, and his description as “controller of chariots” (ráthānāṃ yámam)
a few vss. later (10c) seems like a paraphrase of such a formula. In that case the
poetic figures are more complex than the standard interpr.: there is a metaphor (Agni
as charioteer), and this metaphorical identification is then compared explicitly in a
simile to a horse, which is closely connected conceptually with the charioteer &ndash; a
kind of figurative chaining.
The words toká- and tánaya- regularly appear together; cf., with the same
verb as here, the acc. sg. pairing VI.48.10 párṣi tokáṃ tánayam. When ending with -e
they are typically locatives, as shown by other parallel locatives; cf., e.g., VI.25.4
toké vā góṣu tánaye yád apsú (also I.114.8, VI.31.1, 66.8, X.147.3). Here, however, I
think they are dual accusatives, as if elliptical duals from a dual dvandva. (That is,
toké tánaye doesn’t mean “two progenies and two prosperities.”) The presence of
ubhé ‘both’ serves to mark them as duals (see also I.147.1), since, given the passages
just cited, the usual expectation for toké tánaye is locative. So also Old and Re, while
Ge takes toké as du and tánaye as loc.: “(Erhalte) beiderlei Samen in der
Nachkommenschaft,” a splitting of the usually conjoined phrase that seems very
unlikely.
Taking párṣi as the verb governing both ubhé toké tánaye (as VI.48.10
strongly encourages us to do) and rā́dhaḥ in d requires slightly different
interpretations of the verb. Re, almost predictably, calls it a zeugma.
104</p>
<h3 id="viii10310">VIII.103.10</h3>
<p>I follow Old, Ge, and Re in taking āsāva as the voc. of a (hapax) PN,
though it could be simply ‘o presser’ (ā́√su) as Gr takes it (and perhaps implicitly
Mayrhofer, since it does not appear in his PN book). There are no implications either
way.</p>
<h3 id="viii10311">VIII.103.11</h3>
<p>Note the playful úditā … níditā véditā, already pointed to by Old, in
which the three rhyming words are grammatically entirely different: fem. loc. sg.,
neut. acc. pl., and masc. nom. sg. agent noun respectively.
What is being compared to the waves (ūrmáyaḥ) in c? Ge supplies “Absichten”
(intentions), presumably on the basis of dhiyā́in d, but the dhī́- of Agni should not be
considered negative or hostile. Re’s suggestion, “flames,” is far more persuasive, but
I think this idea should be combined with Old’s view that ūrmáyaḥ belongs with both
simile and frame. That is, Agni’s flames are already metaphorically waves and then
can be compared with real waves. Cf. the cmpd descriptor of Agni in I.58.45 rúśadūrmi- ‘possessing gleaming waves’.</p>
<h3 id="viii10312">VIII.103.12</h3>
<p>The mā́prohibitive here takes an apparent impv. hṛṇītām rather than the
expected injunctive *hṛṇīta. KH (94–95) explains this as having an underlying pluti
form hṛṇītā3, with nasalization in hiatus, hence *hṛṇītā3m̐, which was misunderstood
by the redactors and normalized to hṛṇītām. Although I find this explan. rather ad
hoc and over-complex, I have nothing better to suggest. I do not, however, subscribe
to his notion that because it is built to a pres. stem, it has inhibitive (“let him stop
being angry”) rather than prohibitive (“let him not be angry”) value. There is nothing
in the hymn up to this point that would indicate that Agni has anything but
benevolent feelings towards us. See IH’s work, which refutes Hoffmann’s
assumption of inhibitive value for pres. injunc. with mā́.
Pāda-final eṣáḥ is less rare than I would have predicted, though the usual
position of nom. sg. eṣá(ḥ) is pāda initial.
VIII.103.12–13: Both vss. end identically with svadhvaráḥ, but in 12c it refers to
Agni, in 13d to the weakling (kīrí-) who is offering homage to Agni. The use of the
same term for both of course implicitly spreads the power and prestige of Agni to his
worshiper.</p>
