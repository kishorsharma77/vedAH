Falcon (1–4), Falcon or Indra (5) [Soma-Theft]  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except śakvarī 5  
The second of the pair of hymns devoted to the soma-theft, this one is told from  Soma’s point of view, with Soma speaking the first two verses (again, in our opin ion), in which Soma engages in some ātmastuti of his own. He boasts of his own  knowledge (vs. 1ab) and power (vs. 2ab), but also in almost breathlessly abrupt  fashion relates the sudden appearance of the falcon, his rescuer (vs. 1d) from con finement (vs. 1b). Asserting that he was complicit in his escape (vs. 2ab), he then  describes their departure, including that of Plenitude (see the introduction to the  last hymn).  
The next two verses (3–4) freeze the dramatic moment when the archer Kr̥śānu,  guardian of Soma, shoots at the fleeing falcon with his precious cargo, and man ages only to shoot off one feather. The final verse (5) depicts Indra about to drink  the soma, now ritually prepared and offered by the priests. In keeping with the  archery theme, the verb used of Indra’s approach to the soma is an idiom (práti √dhā) ordinarily used of fixing an arrow to a bowstring and aiming it at the target.
