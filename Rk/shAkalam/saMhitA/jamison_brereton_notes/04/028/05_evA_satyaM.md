Note #índraś ca here and #índraś ca(krám) in 2b. Also, presumably we get a reverse Vāyav Indraś ca construction here (índraś ca soma rather than standard soma índraś ca), so that Indra can be pāda-initial, as in 1b, 2b.

There is clear (and fairly unusual) enjambement over the hemistich boundary: … ūrvám áśvyaṃ góḥ / ádardṛtam, with the obj. of the verb in c found in b. There is disagreement about the disposition of the rest of the 2nd hemistich. The publ. tr. takes ápihitāny áśnā as obj. of riricáthuḥ, with tatṛdānā́a dual pf. part. with acc. pl. kṣā́ḥ as its obj. As indicated in the publ. intr. I identify those things “covered over by the stone” to be the waters and cows that Indra released (in the Vṛtra and Vala myths respectively). This fits with the use of ápihita- in 1d. Ge also takes ápihitāni as obj.

of riricáthuḥ, but the last three words, kṣā́ś cit tatṛdānā́as a simile (marked by cid, which he considers a possible simile marker, and I don’t). For him tatṛdānā́is passive and kṣā́ḥ is nom. sg. WG take ápihitāni as a second obj. of ā́dardṛtam. The obj. of riricáthuḥ is, for them, kṣā́ḥ (acc. pl.), which also serves as obj. of tatṛdānā́, which they consider dual and transitive, as I do. Their interpr. of cd follows that of Kü (216, 424), and it is certainly grammatically possible. However, I do not understand what it would mean to release the dwelling places (Kü) or the parts of the earth (WG) (e.g., WG “Ihr habt die Erdteile freigelassen”), whereas the release of the pent-up waters after drilling through the earth fits the Indra mythology perfectly.

The cadence of b is bad and would be improved by reading *tātṛdānā́, as Arnold suggested and Old seems tentatively to accept.
