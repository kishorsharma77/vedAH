In a agre-gáḥ echoes ágre áhnām in 42a; in our vs. áhnām appears in the following pāda, dependent on something else (vimā́naḥ), though Re supplies it with agregáḥ as well.

bhúvaneṣv árpitaḥ also in 39b.

In d I construe rāyé with okyàḥ, although I cannot find any parallel usage. But on its own, okyàḥ is hard to fit semantically into the vs.; cf. Ge’s “gern bleibend” and Re’s “(ce dieu) domestique,” which seem like afterthoughts..
