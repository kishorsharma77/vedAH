Āprı̄  
Sumitra Vādhryaśva  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
An eleven-verse Āprī hymn, with Narāśaṃsa in verse 2 (like II.3, V.5), where  some Āprī hymns instead have Tanūnapāt (I.188, III.4, VII.2, IX.5, and X.110).  There are otherwise few deviations from the standard Āprī hymn template, except  that r̥tvíj “priest, orderly sacrificer” is substituted for the standard Hotar in verse  7. The trimeter meter gives more scope for elaboration than some of the more  minimalist dimeter Āprī hymns (e.g., I.13). A  signature word is uśánt “eager,  desirous” (4d, 5c, 6c, 9d). As always in Āprī hymns, the key word or phrase in  each verse is italicized.
