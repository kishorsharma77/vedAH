All Gods
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The organizing principle of this hymn is the ritual fire (Agni) and the dawn sacri fice over which he presides. In verse 1 the sacrifice is set in motion; the gods begin934 VII.39
to assemble at dawn at the sacrificial ground (vss. 2–3), and Agni is exhorted to  perform the sacrifice (vs. 4) and to bring the various gods to it (vs. 5). The poet  declares his own contribution to the sacrifice and asks Agni for the appropriate  rewards (vs. 6). The final verse (7) summarizes what has gone before, in the name  of the Vasiṣṭhas.
Verse 2b contains an impossible hapax, bī́riṭe, phonologically aberrant and mor phologically opaque. It is generally taken as “crowd, troop,” following Yāska, but,  as there is no particular etymological or contextual support for this, we have simply  declined to translate it.
