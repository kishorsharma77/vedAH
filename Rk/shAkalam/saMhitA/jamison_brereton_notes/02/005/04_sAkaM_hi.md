The standard tr. construe śúcinā with krátunā (e.g., Ge “mit lauterem Sinne”).

This is certainly possible -- though śúci- krátu- is not a standard collocation -- but not necessary.

The standard tr. also assume a change of subject in cd from Agni (ab) to a priest “who knows Agni’s vratas” (vidvā́m̐asya vratā́dhruvā́). I find this unlikely; vidvā́n modifies Agni in vs. 8 (in my view), as well as twice in the next, closely related, hymn (II.6.7, 8). Moreover, vidvā́n is regularly used absolutely, taking an object much less often. I construe vratā́dhruvā́instead with ánu: “according to his vratás.” The collocation ánu vratá- is quite common; here the vratá- would be the rules that govern the natural world (plants and fires).
