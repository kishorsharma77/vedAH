Indra (1–16), Aśvins (17–19), Dawn (20–22)  
Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti  
22 verses: gāyatrī, except triṣṭubh 16, arranged in tr̥cas  
The first five tr̥cas (vss. 1–15) are dedicated to Indra, with the following verse (16),  in a different meter, serving as a summary verse for this, the major part of the hymn.  There follow one tr̥ca (vss. 17–19) dedicated to the Aśvins and one (vss. 20–22) to  Dawn. All of these gods are, of course, associated with the rituals of early morning.  
Although the contents of the hymn are fairly standard—praise and invitation to  the gods and requests for their help and gifts—the syntax can be fussy and tricky.  See especially the final tr̥ca to Indra (vss. 13–15), whose structure and import are  not entirely clear. The portion of the hymn devoted to Indra focuses especially on  the mutuality of our relationship as his comrades (see esp. vss. 6–12), and the theme  of prizes and prize contests is prominent as well.
