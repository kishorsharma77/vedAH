The part. nadáyan here (as well as the other 2 forms of this stem) is universally taken as a trans.-caus. ‘causing to resound’ with Heaven and Earth as obj.

As I argue in my -áya-book (60-61), all 3 passages are better taken as intrans. In this vs. the focus is on the noise that Soma makes; see esp. the parallel part.

abhikánikradat ‘constantly roaring’. And so intrans. ‘bellowing’ fits this pattern.

Note also IX.70.6 mātárā … nā́nadad eti “he goes bellowing to his two mothers [=Heaven and Earth,” with the same config. of participle to √nad + eti + H+E.
