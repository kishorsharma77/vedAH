The preverb prá, which must be in tmesis from the verb aheṣata that ends the vs., is very oddly positioned -- in the middle of a pāda (one that doesn’t even contain the verb), not adjoining a metrical boundary. I have no explanation, though it may be based on a pāda like IX.64.4 ásṛkṣata prá vājínaḥ, also ending prá vājínaḥ, where the preverb immediately follows its verb, a permitted position.
