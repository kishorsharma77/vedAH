The desid. part. dúdukṣan is mildly notable because 1) it does not exhibit reverse-Grassmann (*dúdhukṣan) unlike the s-aor. ádhukṣat (also, however, 3 adukṣat); 2) it is a real part., not the u-adj. often substituting for the part. in the desid.

(*dudukṣú-).

Because of the overt switch to the 1st ps. in c, I take the pf. sasṛje in b as 1st ps.

(flg. JPB p.c.), with vásiṣṭhaḥ doubling the underlying subject. The pf. form is of course ambig. between 1st and 3rd.

As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. exhibits a kind of ring comp. via an anagrammatic pun: 1c vásu ... vániṣṭhaḥ “best gainer of goods” is compressed into the name of the poet vásiṣṭhaḥ (vás[u]… [ván]iṣṭhaḥ). This brings the first section of the hymn to a close; the battle scene erupts abruptly in the next vs. ### 05
My tr. of the 2nd hemistich follows Old’s, contra Ge.
