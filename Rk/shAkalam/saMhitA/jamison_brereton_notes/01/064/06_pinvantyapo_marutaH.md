vidátheṣv ābhúvaḥ, repeated, as noted above, from 1d, is ambiguous. It can modify the waters of the first pāda, as Ge (/WG) take it, or the Maruts (so Re). I have tried to maintain the ambiguity. In vs. 1 the phrase qualified the hymns (fem. pl.

gíraḥ) and, if apó of pāda c is not emended, those waters as well.
