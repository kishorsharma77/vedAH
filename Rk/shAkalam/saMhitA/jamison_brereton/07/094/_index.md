Indra and Agni  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
12 verses: gāyatrī 1–11, anuṣṭubh 12, arranged in trcas ̥  
This hymn consists of four sets of tr̥cas, and if each tr̥ca is considered originally a  separate hymn, the principle of arrangement is not violated. There are two main  themes, the varieties of poetic thought and its product, verbal praise, which the  poets address to the two gods, and the hope that these gods will favor these poets  over their rivals (see esp. vss. 3, 7, 8, 12). Despite the emphasis on poetic inspiration,  there seems to be relatively little of it on display in this hymn, which is a bricolage  of quotations from other hymns. The two gods, Indra and Agni, also lack traits,  individually and collectively.
