In pāda a, along with Ge and Re (see also Old’s comm. ad loc.) I read ūrmím twice, with both simile and frame; vācáḥ so accented should be gen. sg., not acc. pl., and is therefore not parallel to the two acc. pls. in b, gíraḥ … manīṣā́ḥ.

The standard tr. interpr. the vṛjánā phrase as obj. of antáḥ páśyan (e.g., Re “Regardant à l’intérieur ces sectes (de fidèles) proches”). I instead take the part. in absolute usage (“looking within”; cf. I.132.3) and construe the acc. with ā́tiṣṭhati ‘(sur)mounts’. This makes some spatial sense: if they are ‘below’ (ávarāṇi) it is easy to mount them.

Re and Ober (II.211) think that pāda d refers to copulation. Cf. esp. Ober’s “Der Bulle besteigt die Kühe, [die Kopulation] kennend.” Although “mount” is a standard Engl. term for animal copulation, I am not at all sure that ā́√sthā serves the same function, and I would esp. wonder about using the locative for the female participant(s). And I also doubt that it would need to be added that the bull knew how to do it!
