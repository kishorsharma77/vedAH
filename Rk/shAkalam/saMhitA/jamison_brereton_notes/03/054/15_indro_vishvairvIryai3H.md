The standard tr. construe the instr. víśvair vīryaìḥ as the object of pátyamānaḥ (“being master of all vīryá-), but when pátya- takes an object, it is in the acc., including once in this hymn: 8c patyate víśvam. In the only other passage in which Gr identifies the verb stem as taking an instr., VI.13.4, I take the instr. as here, as expressing the means by which the subject displays his mastery.
