Heaven and Earth
Vāmadeva Gautama
7 verses: triṣṭubh 2–4, gāyatrī 5–7
Like the preceding hymn, this one is divided into two by meter: 1–4, 5–7; the two  were presumably independent hymns originally. The first four verses mix invoca tions of Heaven and Earth at the current sacrifice with cosmogonic accounts of  their creation (see esp. vs. 3 and its present-time counterpart in 1cd), but the ritual  context is dominant. There are a number of puns. The short second hymn continues  the ritual focus.
