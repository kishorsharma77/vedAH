R. N, Dandekar : Select Writings I  
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS  

## Intro
Professor Dr. R. N. DANDEKAR completes his seventy years on the 17th of March 1979, and we are glad to present to the lovers of Indology this first Volume of his &quot;Select Writings ” on this very happy occasion, 

It is not necessary to describe here the long and meritori ous services rendered by Prof. DANDEKAR to Indology and Sanskritic studies. They are, indeed, too well known. Apart from his writings which have appeared in book form, the articles and papers which he has contributed to various Journals from time to time are quite numerous. It was felt that it would be very helpful if some select ones of these papers were collected and made available to students of Indology in handy volumes. These papers are valuable because of their variety, comprehensiveness, and authoritative pronouncements. The present Volume contains Prof. DANDEKAR's papers relating to Vedic Mythology. 

We thought of bringing out this Volume on the 71st Birthday of Prof. DANDEKAR, We have to thank Prof. DANDEKAR for having kindly agreed to our request in this respect. We have also to thank the authorities of the Bhandarkar Institute Press for their uniform courtesy while the Volume was through the Press. 

We take this opportunity of wishing Prof. DANDEKAR excellent health and long life to continue to render service to Indology and to bless and inspire his pupils. 

T. 0. Mainkar S. Balwant 


At the cordial insistence of several friends and through the good offices of Professor Dr TG MAINKAR, the first volume of my Select Writings is being published today. It contains some papers relating to Vedic Mythology written by me in the course of the last nearly forty years. They are reproduced here, without much revision, in the chronological order of their first publication Though I may have modified my views on some minor points, my main theses remain substantially unchanged. 

A word of sincere appreciation is due to the Bhandarkar Institute Press for its efficient and expeditious work I am grateful to Shri A N GOKHALEY of the BORI for his meticulous proof reading and to Dr G U THITE for the 

The publishers have all along been quite considerate and cooperative

<p>NEW LIGHT ON THE VEDIC GOD, SAVITR</p>
<p>There has been considerable difference of opinion, among Vedic scholars, in respect of the exact interpretation of the character and personality of the Vedic god, Savitr. This fact naturally enbances our interest in the study of the Vedic mythology concerning that god A critical approach to the problem regarding the essential nature of Savitr is expected greatly to clanfy our views in the matter of Indo-European (IE ) mytho logy in general and Vedic mythology in particular.</p>
<p>OLDENBERG is strongly of the opinion that the concept underlying the god Savitr cannot, under any circumstances be taken back to the indogermanic poriod? Savitr is comparatively a younger member of the Vedic pantheon, this fact is amply corroborated by the very name of that god, that is, Savitr, which is directly derived from the Vedic root su (to stimulate, to vivify), as well as by the manner in which that god has actually come joto being The genesis of Sants, according to OLDENBERG, clearly indicates a very late phase in the evolution of the Vedic religious thought? The earlier and morc important gods of the Rgieda (RV) like Varuna, Mitra, Indra, etc, are believed mainly to represent the personifications of patural phenomena In the descriptions of these gods, the naturalistic element often becomes quite apparent. They consequently possess a sort of concrete ness about their nature and character A natural step further In the evolution of the religious thought was to go from the external concrele form of natural phenomcon to the inner abstract spirit which was supposed to be working behind those pheno mega The most outstanding characteristic of the whole universal Iifc is the manifold motion or movement' (Bcwegung) which is clearly percepuble everywhere Every phenomenon of nature as well as cvery activity of human beings has some form of movement' involved in it the sun rises and sets; Aśvinau go on their usual rounds, the rivers flow, men start working — all these happenings presuppose some kind of sti mulation' or &lsquo;vivification&rsquo; from withip It is only as the result of that stimulation that the whole world order is kept eternally going The physical fact of movement' and &lsquo;motion&rsquo;, thus, logically led to its spiritual counterpart of stimulation It was this concept of stimulation', as the result of which the whole universal order was set into motion, that was believed to have been deified in the later phase of the evolution of the Vedic reli gious thought A definite and independent god came to be looked upon as being mainly and exclusively responsible for this &lsquo;stimula. tion&rsquo;, and that god was Savitr He was the &lsquo;god stimulator&rsquo;. The origin of Savitr therefore, belongs, according to OLDENBERG, to a period when abstract concepts were deified and added to the Vedic pantheon Trātr, Dhātr, Netr, even Prajapati, are some of the other gods who belong to this category The gram matical form of the name Savitr also is quite noteworthy Here a present participle is made to represent a distinct Vedic god, as in the case of Dhātr, Netr, etc The Vedic poet does not any longer restrict himself, while naming a god, to the physical function of that god, such as Varuna, the &lsquo;pervader&rsquo;, or Indra, the kindler, etc, but he now refers to the deeper spiri tual function of that god The god Savitr is often described as stretching out his huge golden hands in order to direct' move ment in the world</p>
<ul>
<li>Helcondes lado, 63 Idd, co</li>
<li>3 OLDENBERG, ZDAIG 51, 473 ff 59, 253 f However, Savits 18 includ cd among the divinities of the evening Soma pressing</li>
</ul>
<p>OLDENBERG further believes that the fact that Savitr is a later Vedic god can be clearly proved by the consideration of the position of that god in Vedic ritual Savitr has no Soma libation dedicated to him 3 At the beginning of big sacrifices, Savitr is honoured by being mentioned in the formula often employed by the priests when they want to take hold of any ritual object, with the words derasya savituh prasave This position given to Savitr was obviously an afterthought A place was specially made for that god, since he did not have it in the original scheme of the carlier Vedic ritual IIc was, therefore, glorified just at the beginning of the ritual</p>
<p>OLDENBERG puts forth still another viewpoint regarding the nature of Saystr It was generally observed that the sun god was mainly responsible for the most enormous movement in the universe and that all other movements were apparently dependent upon him Ultimately, therefore, the sun-god came to be regarded as the stimulator' par excellence, and the epithet, savitr, was, in many passages, employed with reference to Surya This consequently led to the usual misconception that Sayitr was Originally conceived of as being identical with Surya OLDEN BERG has strongly &ndash; and, as will be shown, in detail, later on, fightly — opposed this idea of the identifieation of these two Vedic gods, Surya and Savits 4 In the eleven entire hymns addressed to Savit, as well as in the several references made in the Veda to that god, the solar character of that god is hardly brought forth with any prominencc Sayitr 15, without doubt, associated in Vedic hymns with light' and &lsquo;splendour (IY 62, 132, 142, VII 76 1), he is said to stimulate splendour in the east (X 139 1), he illumides the mid region and the heaven and the earth (I 35 9-11), he brings blessings to man, with all seasons, by day and in the night (IV 53 7), he is the father of Suryā, indeed the whole hymn, V 81, seems particularly to em phasisc thc suplıke character of Savitr But these references do not indicate, as will be shown later, the &lsquo;solar sources of the origin of Savitr The evidence against the identification of Savits with Surya is, indeed, quite overwhelming</p>

<p>OLDENDERC has mus arived at mitt important contra sions regarding the nature of Savitr</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) The god Sayitr belongs to a late phase in the evolution of the Vedic religious thought - to a phase when abstract concepts came to be defied Savitt represents an abstraction of the idea of &lsquo;stimulation&rsquo;</li>
<li>(2) Savitr is, therefore, clearly a later addition to the pantheon of Vedic gods. The study of the evolution of Vedic mythology and the consideration of the position of Savitr in Vedic ritual corroborate this viewpoint</li>
<li>(3) The identification of Savitr with Surya is a gross mis conception The essential&rsquo; in the nature of Savity is not the idea of the sun god in general or of the sun god in any of his particular aspects, the essential&rsquo; in his nature is definitely the deification of the idea of stimulation</li>
</ul>
<p>As regards OLDENBERG&rsquo;s first conclusion, it must be said that there is available abundant evidence to show that Savitr cannot be regarded merely as an &lsquo;abstraction divinity: The descriptions of Savitr in Vedic hymns are so pictorial that one is definitely inclined to believe that the Vedic poet must have thought of some concrete personality&rsquo; as being represented by that god The RV describes Sayits as possessing golden arms (I 35 9-10, VI 71 1,4,5, VII 45 2) He is broad handed (11 38 2), he has beautiful hands (111 33 6), he wears a tawny garment (IV 53 2), his omniform car is golden (1 35 2,3,5) and is driven by two radiant steeds (I 35 2-5) Savits raises aloft his two strong arms in order to bless all beings and set them working ( 38 2, IV 53 4, VI 71 1,5) He is once called apam napät (1 226) All these descriptions go to prove convincingly that the Vedic poet thought of Sayitr as possessing a positively concrete personality and not as representing merely an abstract conception A comparison of the descriptions of Savitr on the one hand and those of purely abstract divinities like Trātr, Netf, Dhātr, etc, on the other, will prove very suggestive 10 this connection As MAX MULLER has aptly observed, the gwr and brightness of Savute siga fcantiy contrast with the pale and shadowy features of deities like Dhatr, Trāts, etc, which are included by OLDENBERG in the same category as Savit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alax MULLER, Contributions to the Science of Mythology, pp 819</li>
</ul>
<p>These latter divinities have no concrete personality behind them, and so the personification of abstract concepts represented by  them is lifeless and unconvincing The case of Savitr, on the other hand, is quite different There is considerable anthropo morphism to be seen in the personality of that god, the acti vities of that god are described, by the Vedic poets, as if they are human in character The Vedic poets seem to have actually visualised by means of their divine poetic eye, ārsa caksu, the majestic personality of Savits raising alost his huge golden hands in order to direct and set in motion the affairs of the world</p>
<p>OLDENBERG bas further put too great ad emphasis on the significance of the formula, devasya tvā savituh prasave , often repeated at the beginning of the Vedic ritual He maintains that the fact that Savitç is mentioned just at the beginning of the ritual indicates that the place given to him io the Vedic ritual is an afterthought and that the formula, devasja savituh prasave , brings forth prominently the nature of Savitr as representing the abstract conception of stimulation. But it must be remembered that that formula continues with the words aśvinor bāhubhyam pusno hastabhjām This fact would show that the whole formula was stereotyped and did not possess any specific significance of its own. On the other hand, Savitr is regularly referred to in the Agaistoma and mention is often made of the săutra graha dedicated to him In the Altareja Br (III 30), the Rbhus arc associated with Savits and are called his anterāsāh The RV (1,110 2-3, 161 11) describes the Rbhus as living in the house of Savity for twelve days This latter reference clearly presupposes a specific personal character of the Vedic god Savit Savitç is bere undoubtedly the name of a distinct mythological personality Savitr is again called agohja in these RV passages, Sāyana explains the word agohya as aditya This implied conocction of Savity with Aditya makes Savits possibly a member of the Varuna-Aditya-mythological circle Io the Tarttırıza Samuta (1 1 9), Savity is associated with
fetters, which fact again goes against bis being merely an abstraction-divinity on the whole, the position of Savitç in Vedic ritual, contrasted with that of Dhatr, Netf, etc, proves conclusively that Savit belongs to quite a different category from that of the latter dividitics The Vedic ritualists, like the Vedic poets, looked upon Savits as possessing a clearly concretc personality</p>
<p>The second conclusion of OLDENBERG, namely, that Savits is a later addition to the pantheon of Vedic gods, is based upon his first conclusion and must, therefore, needs fall to the ground with it The conception of a god, who stimulates and directs the huge world order, cannot be said to belong exclusively to a later phase of Vedic mythology The evolution of the Aryan religious thought may be briefly stated as follows It was first of all the infinite vastness, brilliance, and bounty of nature, which strongly impressed the mind of the people They defied this infinite vastness and glorified it in the divine form of Father Dyauh (Zeus)-Dyauh Pitar (Jupiter) This may, indeed, be regarded as one of the oldest religious conceptions of the IE mythology The Aryans, however, do not seem to have developed the mytho logical concept of Dyauh to the extent to which the concepts of Zeus and Jupiter have been developed They laid stress on ano ther observation of theirs in this connection, namely, that this infinitely vast nature was not an uncontrolled chaos The sun rose and set punctually, the rivers flowed in their well defined courses, the stars shone with undisturbed regularity, every acti vity in the universe was regulated in a perfect but incomprehenst ble manner All this must be due to a certain law' or &lsquo;order&rsquo; which worked behind all the world phenomena This view, which, as suggested above, had developed particularly promi pently and more or less exclusively among the proto Aryans, gave rise to the conception of rta, cosmic order, and its mytho logical counterpart, Varuna in RV, the sovereign lord, samrāt, whose function it was to see that this world-order' remained undisturbed and unbroken The sovereign lord Varuna super vised, controlled, and driected every movement', big or small, from the enormous daily rounds of the sun god to the slightest winking of the eye in the case of an ordinary mortal The abstract idea of stimulation and its divine counterpart Savitr, both of which are so closely related to the Varuna-rla conception, need not, therefore, be regarded as necessarily belonging to a late phase in the evolution of the Vedic religious thought OLDEN BERG has jncluded Savitr in the category of dividities like Dhătr, Nets, etc, which latter are obviously later creations of the Vedic poets The very fact, however, that eleven entire hymns are addressed to Savit; and that about 170 referenccs arc made to that god, should be sufficient to disprove the contention of OLDENBERG No other divinity belonging to that late category suggested by OLDENBERG has been so much glorified and sung in the Vedic hymns OLDENBERG has not been able to explain why only one god, Savitr, in preference to the other gods be longing to the same late group and category, should have been raised so high and be placed, in the Vedic hymps themselves, on the same level as the older and more important Vedic gods The association of Savits with the greater and older gods of the RV is such as would definitely go against the possibility of his being a younger member of the Vedic pantheon
The fact that Savitr plays a comparatively small and unim portant role in the Vedic situal does not at all prove, as OLDEN BERG avers, that he is a later Vedic god For, similar is the case with Varuna, who cannot, under any circumstances, be regarded as a younger member of the Vedic pantheon On the oilier hand, Prajapati, who clearly belongs to a late phase of the Vedic religious thought, is very prominent in the Vedic ritual I shall try to show later on that, though the name of this god, Savitr, may be of purely lodian origin, the main characteristics and functions represented by that god may, in some form, be traced back to the proto Aryan ideology
OLDENBERG vehemently opposes the proposition that the Vedic god Savitç was originally conceived of as an aspect of the sud god HILLEBRANDT? and L VON SCHROEDERS have, indeed, identified Savitr with Surya It will be necessary, at thus stage, to consider critically and in detail the view of HILLEBRANDT

VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
regarding the essential nature of Savitr HILLCBRANDT first of all takes into consideration the position of Suvits in the Vedic ritual There is in the Tarija Br (III 10 1) a reference, in connection with agnlciti, to an altar of Savitr, namely, sarvatah parimandalam rathacakramatranı suntram parılıkhya Accor ding to HILLEBRANDT, this description clearly indicates the solar nature of Savit Further he points out that the possible connection of Savate with Aditya implıcd 151 RY (1 110 2, 161. 11 ) supports the assumption that Savity is identical with the sun god in the AŠvamedha sacrifice there arc offerings to be made to Savit, on cach day, during the year, which fact suggests the pature of that god as the lord of the year. And this lord of the year' cannot be any other than the sun god These arguments, based on the study of the Vedic ritual and brought forth by HILLEDRANDT in order to support his proposed identi fication of Sayıts with Surya, are far from being convincing it must be remembered that the original personality of a Vedic god is often changed considerably when that god is transferred to the ritual Varuna, who played such an important role in the Vedic mythology, is, for example, rarely the central figure in the Vedic ritual To try to ascertain the nature of a Vedic god primarily from the study of the position of that god in the Vedic ritual is, therefore, not the correct method The main characteristics of a god usually fall into the background and his minor features, which alsord some scope for ritualistic employment, are greatly. magnified The original personality of a god is thus often distorted for the sake of the contingencies of the ritual Moreover the arguments put forth by HILLEBRANDT regarding the nature of Savits, on the strength of the position of that god in the Vedic ritual, do not prove anything positively except that the Vedic ritualists had known Savitr as possessing a concrete personality The peculiar form of the savitra altar, which, according to HILLE BRANDT, represents the solar orb, may as well be suggestive of the conception of motion in the world order which is kept eternally going as a consequence of the stimulation given by
9. HALLEBRANDT, Ritualiteratur, 150
THE VEDIC GOD SAVITR
Savit Further, the implication that Savits is one of the Adityas does not prove that Savits is the sun god, since the Adityas originally belong to the Varuna sta mythological complex Moreover, several gods besides Surya are glorified as “lords of the year' About Varuna, for instance, it is said in RV (1 25 8) ieda maso dhrlarrato dadaša prajaratah/seda ja upajaj ale
There are, on the other hand other ritualistic details about Savit, which positively go against his being identified with Surya In the Tanda Sam (119) Savitr is associated with fetters, which fact rather leads to the possible identity of Varuna and Savit The pasas are a more or less exclusive feature of the Varuna mythology In RV (VI 715), Savitr is compared with the Upavakts This Upavaktī is in later ritual, called Maitravaruna, thus perhaps suggesting Savits affinity to the Varuna Mitra mythology There is not the slightest hint, in the Vedic ritual, that Savitz is identical with Surya Had Savitr and Surya been identical with each other, they could have intercbanged their places in the ritual, one could have been substituted for the other As a matter of fact, however, each of them is mentioned at distinct stages in the course of the ritual and the parts which they are made to play in the ritual are also quite distinct
When HILLEBRANDT refers to the descriptions of Savitrin the RV 10 he is on firmer ground His views in this connection may be briefly summarised as follows In a large number of RV passages, Savity is predominantly descnbed as the lord of light and splendour) These descriptions very clearly bring out the solar pature of that god The mandalas which afford the most obvious indication of the identity of Savitr and Surya are the fourth and the fifth The hymn IV 53, will be perfectly unintelligible without the assumption of the identity of these two gods The idea of stimulation is no doubt often emphasised 10 the RV But the conention of OLDENBERG that Savits, as the god representing the abstract conception of vivification, IS

older than Savits, faintly and secondarily possessing the charactc. ristics of the sun god, cannot stand Indeed, we find both these ideas in one and the same hymn For instance,
präsāvid bharam dripade cafuspade (V 81 2) utefise prasavasya riani cha it (V 815
nahamahliyal sawla varenja
&lsquo;nu prazananıysaso u rijall (V 81 2) As regards the fast reference, namely u nukam , it should be noted that there is hardly any difference between this description of Savits and the usual descriptions of Surya and Agni Can OLDENBERG prove, HILLEBRANDT seems to ask, that versc 5 in V 81 is older than verse 2, or that V 82, where the stimula. tion idea is more prominenily expressed, is older than y, 81 ? The following passages in the RV rcferring to Sürya, pamely, (11 115 4 madhyā hartor vitaram sam jabhāra, (2) 1 115 4: iadedayukta harital sadhasthad, (3) X 37 9 Jasja le vista bhuvananı hefuina (4) VIII 25 19 udu sja sarane dno, and (5) VII 791 susamdrgbhiruk sabhurbhanumasret , may be compared respectively with the following Vedic passages referr ing 10 Sayıts, namely, (1) 11 38 4 punah samavjad vitaram vay antı, (2) II 38 3 nunamariramadaramanam cideroh, (3) I 35 2 a hrsnena rojoso yoriamanah , (4) VII 76 1 ud u jyotiramrtam višiajanyam , and (5) VII 72 4 ürdinam bhānum sayılā devo afrek The ideas expressed in these passages are similar, the literary expressions too are almost similar The only natural conclusion, according to HILLEBRANDT, therefore, 1s that Surya and Savitr were, to the mind of the Vedic poet, identical with each other They are often spoken of indiscri mipately in the RV 11 One is described in terms usually applied to the other, and therefore, it becomes hardly possible to keep the two gods apart
With reference to these arguments of HILLEBRANDT in favour of identifying Savitr with Surya, it may be said, at the outset, that the learned Vedic scholar has taken into consideration only

THE VEDIC GOD SAVITR
11
Very general characteristics of Savitr Such divine characteristics as being the lord of light and splendour, spreading rays of light everywhere, moving in golden chariot, etc, are the common property of the Vedic poets They employ these features with reference to any Vedic god, irrespective of his intrinsic pature Association with light and splendour and other kindred features is the most common device used by the Vedic poet for the glo rification of each and every divinity Further, in a few passages quoted by HILLEBRANDT, Sayıt seems to have been brought in close connection with Surya, because the predominant function of Savits, pamely, that of stimulating directing, and control ling the world phenomepa, is the peculiar feature, if but in a restricted sense, of the nature of Surya also What Savitr is to the whole UDIerse including the sun god, Surya is to a few happenings in the world This fact naturally gave rise to the misconception regarding the identity of these two Vedic gods
A closer and more critical examination of the personality of Savitr clearly indicates that that god definitely transcends the limitations implied by the nature of the sun god Savitr agd Surya may appear from somc Vedic passages to be more or less identified, but they are more often differentiated from each other The contents of the Savitr hymns differ substantially from those of the Surya hymns The Surya hymns are usually restricted merely to the descriptions of &lsquo;tisung illumining light , while the Sayitr hymans put conspicuous emphasis upop the nature of that god as the &ldquo;stimulator, controller, and director of the world order It is said of Savitr, in contrast with Surya, that he regulates, ceaselessly and with care, the various phenomena, clearly defining their limus
Let us bring together a few features of the sun god, which are prominently described in the hymns addressed to him agd which are, at the same time, never mentioned with reference to Savitr Surya is the eye of Mitravarunau (1 115 I, VI 51 1, VII 61 ) or the eye of gods (VII 77 3) while, Savitr is hi seif described as sur) araśn (X 139 1) Surya is the spy of the world (IV 13 3), his chariot is drawn by seven steeds (V 45 9%
12
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
as against the two radiant steeds of Sayitr (1 35 3) The path of Surya is prepared for him by Varuna (1 248, VII 87 1) or by Adityas, Mitra, Varuna, and Aryaman (VII 60 4), while Savitr himself lays down courses for all (II 38 7, 9) Surya&rsquo;s father is Dyauh (X 37 1), and he is said to be god born (X 37 1), the mention is often made of Surya having been produced and placed in heaven by several gods &ndash; by Indra (II 12 7), by Indravisnu (VII 994), by Mitrāvarunau (IV 13 2, V 63 4), by Indravarunau (VII 82 3), and by Dhats (X 190 3) This is a feature which clearly distin guishes Surya from Savitr, for, it is Savitr who is said to have produced and set in motion other natural powers (Il 38 7,9) Surya is further described as a bird (X 177 1), or a bull (X 189 1 ), or a steed ( VII 77 3 ), while in many other passages he is even spoken of as an inanimate object (V 62 2,63 4, VII 63 4), this is again a feature, which can never be thought of with reference to Savits who is the stimulator of all objects, azimate as well as inanimate Saut is often described, unlike Surya, as vivifying Väyu and Pusan (X 64 7, 139 1) Other features which clearly differentiate the functions of these two gods are the following Waters obey the ordinance of Savitr (IT 38 I), with his hands Savitr leads the rivers onwards (III 33 6), water and wind obey the law of Sayitr (II 38 2), Savitç is prasavità as well as niveśanah (IV 53 6)
The above discussion will be sufficient to prove how the Vedic poets thought of Surya and Savit; as two quite distinct divinities with quite distinct functions Another feature which clearly distinguishes these two gods from each other is the fact that Savitr is a god of morning as well as of evening, while Surya is exclusively the god of morning Descriptions like a krsnena rajaså vartamāno niesa; annamrfam martyam ca (I 35 2) and asthad ratham santa citrabhānuh krsna rajansi tavisim dadhanah (1 35 4 ) can hardly be reconciled with the nature of, Surya, who is the lord of light and morning and who is said to be travelling on an illuminated path even after sunset It may be incidentally noted that the western direction is assigned to Savitr in the
THE VEDIC GOD SAVITR
13
Šatapatha Br (III 2 3 18 ), - significantly enough, it is else where assigned to Varuna - thus again suggesting the distinction between Surya and Savitt Another exclusive feature of Savity is his association with amati, the mighty splendour or form This amatı has something magical in it (III 38 8, VII 38 1, 2, 45 3) It is a supernatural miracle, something like the māja of Indra or Varuna No such magical power is ever attributed to the sun god The part plaved by Savitr in connection with the funeral rites (X 17 4, AV XII 2 48), his being raised to the status of Prajapati 10 RV (IV 53 2) and in later brahmanical literature ( Šatapatha By XII 3 5 1, also cf Taittirija Br I 64 1) and of Brbaspati (Tatlırija Sam IV 17 3,2 8 1), his being preeminently called asura (IV 53 ) these are still other characteristics of the personality of Savitr, which clearly distinguish him from Surya Savitr unlike Surya, controls the working of all other gods (II 38 7,9), no god dare resist his will (V 82 2), Savits bestows immortality not only on the Rbhus (1 110 2, 3), but also on other gods (IV 54 2) Do such references even remotely suggest the identity of Surya and Savitr? Do they not indicate, beyond doubt, that the persona lity of Savit transcends that of the sun god and that the functions of Savıls are far more comprehensive and inclusive than those of Surya? The frequent juxtaposition of these two gods again proves nothing if not the clear cut distinction between them The references such as that Savit declares men sinless to Surya (1 123 3) or that Savitç combines with the rays of Surya (V 81 4 ) go to show that Surya is clearly distinct from and subordidate to Savity Indeed, the whole hymn, V 81, is impor tant from this point of view In vir 35, where distinctive characteristics of different Yovie gods seem to have been mention cd, Surya and Sayat are clearly distinguished In scveral other passages (1 35 9, 123 3, 157 1, V 81 4, VII 45 2, X 149 3 ) Savits and Surya appear side by side The activity of Saustr is sometimes connected at the setting of the sun (1 35 2, 11 38 2-5) How can this be cxplained if Surya and Sauts are identical ? Sayitt is said to bring forth night (11 38 3 IT ), which description is unthinkable with reference to
14
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
Surya It is further said that even Surya himself makes his activity subserve Savitr (VII 45 2 ) and that Srvits impels Surya (I 35 9 ) Savitr the asura is said to be surveying the mid region in the evening and in that connection (1 35 7 ) the poet asks Where is Suryn now? Such references unequivocally suggest that Savitr was regarded in the RV as the controller of all the activities of the sun god It is therefore, more than certain that the Vedic poets distinguished very clearly between the Vedic gods Surya and Savits, and that they looked upon Savits as a god who is responsible for stimulating and directiog all the phenomena of the world including the one connected with the sun god
MACDONELL thinks that Savitr was originally a general epithet of Indian origin applied later on in a restricted manner, to the sun god as the typ cal stimulator 1: THOMAS13 seems to corroborate MACDONELL S view that Savitr is the divine power of Surya personified These seem to be merely attempts to bring about a knd of compromise between the views of OLDENBERG and HILLEBRANDT The word sautr may have been in some cases used as an epithet of Deva (god) in general This fact would perhaps merely indicate a stage when the present participle from the root su had not been completely transformed into a proper name of a definite god It should be remembered that the descriptions of Savitr are not of a general character so that they can be appled to any god in his capacity of a stimulator As MAX MULLER has said the name Savitr may be of the nature of a general title but it is never on that account appl ed to any enlivener whether rain or moon or wind 14 It will be presently shown that the characteristics of Savitr are indicative of a distinct Vedic god in his aspect of the stimulator of theworld order

into consideration the other distinctive characteristics of Savitr, Even after a long discussion, BERGAIGNE does not arrive at any definite conclusion regarding the essential personality of Savitr.16 He, however, says that the nature of Savit; cannot be explained in terms of solar functions. The distinction that Sürya represents the physical orb of the sun-god, while Savits represents the inner presiding divinity of the sun-god is, according to BERGAIGNE, not correct. He refers to the implied identity of Savitr with Bhaga (IV, 55. 10; V. 82.3; VI. 50.13), and to the close copnec tion between Savitr and Prajāpati (IV. 53. 2), between Savitz and Tvaştı (IX. 81. 4; X. 10. 5), between Savitr aod Pūşan (IX. 81.4), and between Soma and Savitr (IIJ. 56. 6; X. 149. 5). DERGAIGNE further emphasises the hermaphrodite nature of Savits ( III. 38. 8) remarking that Sayıts combines in himself the characteristics of both sexes. These are, however, merely stray references, which obviously do not indicate the true nature of Savitr. It may be that Savitr, in his different capacities, as the benefactor who distributcs wealth, as the creator of the universe and the sustainer of the world-order, as the pourisher of the crea tures, etc., has been brought into close association with several Vedic gods. This fact shows that the sature of Savits is not identical exclusively with the nature of any one of these gods but that it definitely includes and transcends the distinctive features of all these gods,
The above discussion will clcarly indicate how the cxplana lions regarding the true nature of Savitr proposed by OLDEN BERG, HILLCORANDT, MACDONELL, THOMAS, ROTH, and BERGAIGNE arc cither one-sided and incomplete or definitely beside the mark.&rdquo; A critical consideration of the views of these scholars has, honcycr, lcd us so far to the following main conclusions :

(1) Sayitr is not merely an abstraction divinity of the type of Dhātr, Netr etc It is, therefore, not necessary to assume that Savitr belongs to a later phase of the Vedic religious thought and that, therefore, the conception underlying that god cannot be taken back beyond the Vedic mythology
(2) The view that Savitr was originally conceived of as being identical with Surya is a misconception, which has originated on account of the fact that the main function of Savitr, namely,
stimulation&rsquo;, is seen to have been attributed, to a restricted extent, also to the sun god As a matter of fact, however, the Vedic poets have clearly differentiated between these two gods
(3) The word savitr is not always an epithet of a general character, so that it can be applied to any god in his capacity of
enlivener&rsquo; More commonly, there is a specific divine persona lity possessing its own essential nature which is presupposed by the name Savitr
What then is the essential nature of Savits? In order to understand it correctly, we have to analyse the eleven entire hymns addressed to that god and the 170 references made to him 10 the RV in such a way that only those characteristics of his personality are brought together which clearly distinguish him from other Vedic gods It is an indisputable fact that the Vedic poets are often in the habit of using stock phrases with reference to any and every god This their propensity has given rise to the innumerable repetitions in the Veda pointed out by BLOOM FIELD These common poetic formulas do not usually help us in estimating the character of a particular Vedic god We have, therefore, to base our views regarding the true and intrinsic nature of any god on the study of the nivids or the exclusive characteristics mentioned in connection with that god
A very prominent feature of the nature of Savitr is that the concept of the world order - rta - is often predominantly associa ted with his personality Savitr is the god who supports and sustains the whole world - jarha visvam bhuvanam dhārayisyatı (IV 54 4) He is said to be mainly responsible for maintaining

varsman doch smati satyam asya tat // (IV 54 4) Sayıts is the lord of what moves and what is stationary (IV 536) He is the supporter of the heavens (IV 53 2, X 149 4) and is once said to have fixed the earth with bonds and made the sky firm in the raftcrless space (X 149 1) It is again Saviti who sets in motion the chariot of Asvins (I 34 10 ) It is also under his bchest that several affairs of the world, huge and small, are set going (1 124 1, II 38 I ff) The Athanaveda clearly ordajas (VI 23 3) derasja savituh save karma krnianti nānusah.
These references to Savits in various Vedic passages provide us with a definite starting point for ascertaining the true nature and personality of that Vedic god Io a very large number of passages, Savitr is associated with the concept of rta It has been indicated above that already a stage had been reached in the
18
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
evolution of what may be called the proto-Aryan religious thought when it was positively assumed that this vast and infinite universe was not a lawless chaos, but that it presupposed a well defined cosmic order operating behind all world phenomena The proto-Aryans had also developed a mythological counterpart of that concept &ndash; a god who was responsible for seeing that this rta functioned regularly and without break That god was consequently looked upon as the sovereign lord of the universe, as the ruler, who sustained the law-cosmic and ethical - and who directed and regulated the world phenomena He held the whole world bound down by ineans of his fetters, so that it should not go astray from its regular well defined course, and when he found that his ordinance was broken, he punished the offender also by means of his fetters The working of the cosmic order was, however, beyond the ken of human beings The god, who controlled that cosmic order and made it function in an exceedingly perfect but incomprehensible manner, was, therefore, naturally regarded as the greatest magician and was usually associated with majestic magic power, māya or amati
It is, indeed suggested that many ancient mythologies have this concept of the world order and more particularly of the magician sovereign lord who sees that that cosmic order works without hindrance or break Just as in the RV we have Varuna, and in the Avesta Ahura Mazda, so, in germanic religions, we find this world sovereign represented as Odin Similarly the Lappish have conceived of a sort of · Welten mann', in whom we may see a counterpart of Vedic Varuna A god of the Thrakians is called Darzales—god of bondage' as the name suggests-and both in name and function he reminds one of Varuna The attributes of the world sovereign, such as upholding the cosmic order, magical power, giving of orders, and binding by means of fetters, are common to various ancient mythologies 18
The view regarding the essential nature and personality of Savitr, which I find acceptable, may now be stated as follows

Savitr possesses, as has been shown above, all the characteristics of a god who stimulates, controls, and directs the cosmic order He is very often associated with the main implications of the concept of rta The Vedic poet must have originally thought of Savits as the god who was responsible for stimulating directing, and controlling the world phenomena In other words, Savitr was, for Vedic poets, only another aspect of god Varuna A comparison of the characteristics of Savitr with those of Varuna, which will be attempted presently would clearly indicate that these two gods are, according to the Vedic poet, identical with each other The sovereign lord Varuna was viewed by the Vedic poets from a particular standp int, and special emphasis was put by them on certain of Varuna s peculiar functions It was ander such definite circumstances that Varuna was glorified in the form of Savitr It may be suggested that the word sautr derived from the root sy was originally used in a very general adjectival sense, and, at this stage of usage, the word was employed with reserence to several gods like Surya, Bhaga, Tvastr, etc It was only in later times that the epithet, which had then become almost a proper noun, was restricted to an aspect of Varuna But two facts definitely go against such a hypothesis With this hypothesis, Savitr will have to be placed in the category of Dhātr, Netr, etc, which possibility, however, has already been shown to be out of the question Secondly the connection of Savitr with other older gods of the RV is such as would favour his being regarded as an essentially old and prominent member of the pantheos of Vedic gods, - pamely as an aspect of Varuna The association of Savits with the concept of rta and conscqucntly his implied identily with Varuna seem to be quite original in Vedic mythology
What is the peculiar aspect of the world sovereign, Varuna which is represented by Savitr? Before an attempt was made to answer this question it would be better to bring together the various features which are, in the Veda common to both Varuna and Sayitr
To begin with, it should be noted that in some Vedic passages Sauitf and Varuna have been mentioned in such a
20
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
manner as would clearly bring out the identity of those two gods ! for instance, pra tvä muñcanı varunasya pāśad jena tābadhnat sanitā suśerah (X 85 24 ) Here the word Sayita is used almost as another name of Varuna The same is the case as regards III 54 11, where Savitr is mentioned directly after Mitra and Varuna (III 54 10.) thus suggesting a close connection among these divinities The functions of Savitr in his capacity as a stimulator and director of the world order and the preserver of the cosmic ethical law (II 38 2, III 33 6, IV 53 4, X 34 8, 139 3) are entirely similar to those of Varunaa (VI 70 1; VII 86 1, VIII 41 10,42 1) Savitr is again closely associa ted with other members of the circle of the Varuna mythology, namely, Aditi, Mitra, Aryaman Bhaga etc (Vil 38 4, 66 1-4) By reason of his laws Savitr is said to become Mitra (V.81 4) He is also often referred to as promoting rta (VII 38 2) Savitr plays a double role he sets in motion and also puts to rest all worldly activities, he is both prasavita and nn esanah (IV 536) This unique feature of Savitr&rsquo;s character indicates in a convincing manner, that the word savits was not merely an epithet suggesting the idea of stimulation In that case the two fold nature of Savits would be quite inconsis tent It is thus certain that the Vedic poet thought of Savitr as a distinct god wielding complete control over all the phenomena of the world The usual exclusive epithet of Varuna, namely asura is employed in a very significant - and not merely conven tional - manner with reference to Savitr also (I 35 7, 10, IV 53 1) The word asura (asu + possessive termination ra) had originally the special sense of a god possessing the greatest magical power tubstance The epithet was, accordingly, origina lly restricted to the magician sovereign lord of the world Varuna When Varuga was glorified in his peculiar aspect as Savits, the epithet asura also was naturally transferred to the latter
The chariot of Varuna (and Mitra) is prominently described as shining like the sun (I 122 15 ) and as traversing the highest heaven (V 63 1) The omniform chariot of Savitr also is golden bright (I 35 2-3) and travels to the bright reaims of the

21
heaven where he is united with the rays of the sun (V 81 3-4) Savits puts on a tawny garment (IV 53 2), which may be compared to the golden glistening mantle of Varuna (1 25 13) Varuna and Sants are both connected with the nocturnal heaven (VII 88 2, I 35 2) As a moral governor Varuna staads far above any other desty The spies of Varuna are often mentioned (1 25 13, VII 87 3) The sun is Varuna&rsquo;s eye and is said to be reporting to him the decds of men (VII 60 1) Savitr also is sūr; arasnii (X 139 1 ), and he declares mca sinless to the sun (1 123 3) Varuna is the dispeller of falschood (I 152 1, VII 60 S) and removes sin (II 28 5, V 85 7, 8, VII 86 5) Similar are the characteristics of Savitr, who makes men Staless (IV 54 3 ) and drites away evil spirits (I 35 10, VII 38 7) In this connection 31 15 cry instructive to compare IV 54 3 referring to Savitr

Sürya It is further said that even Surya himself makes his activity subserve Savitr (VII 45 2) and that Savitr impels Surya (I 35 9 ) Savitr, the asura, is said to be surveyiog the mid region in the evening, and in that connection (I 35 7) the poet asks “Where is Surya, now? · Such references unequivocally suggest that Savitr was regarded, in the RV, as the controller of all the activities of the sun god it is, therefore, more than certain that the Vedic poets distinguished very clearly between the Vedic gods, Surya and Sayits, and that they looked upon Sayıts as a god who is responsible for stimulating and directing all the phenomena of the world, including the one connected with the sun god
MACDONELL thinks that Savitr was originally a general epithet of Indian origin, applied later on, in a restricted manner, to the sun god as the typical stimulator 12 THOMASIS seems to corroborate MACDONELL&rsquo;S view that Şavitç is the divine power of Surya personified These seem to be merely attempts to bring about a kind of compromise between the views of OLDENBERG and HILLEBRANDT The word savitr, may have been, in some cases, used as an epithet of Deva (god) in general Tbis fact would perhaps merely indicate a stage when the present participle from the root sū had not been completely transformed into a proper name of a definite god It should be remembered that the descriptions of Sayitr are not of a general character, so that they can be applied to any god in his capacity of a stimulator As MAX MULLER has said, the name Savitr may be of the nature of a general uitle, but it is never, on that account, applied to any enlivener, whether rain or moon, or wind 14 It will be presently shown that the characteristics of Savitr are indicative of a distinct Vedic god in his aspect of the stimulator of theworld order

into consideration the other distinctive characteristics of Savitr Even after a long discussion, BERGAIGNE does not arrive at any definite conclusion regarding the essential personality of Savits 16 He, however, says that the nature of Savitr cannot be explained in terms of solar functions The distinction that Surya represents the physical orb of the sun god, while Savitr represents the inner presiding divinity of the sun god is, according to BERGAIGNE, not correct He refers to the implied identity of Savitr with Bhaga (IV 55 10, V 82 3, VI 50 13), and to the close connec tion between Sayitr and Prajāpatı (IV 53 2), between Savits and Tyastr (IX 81 4, X 10 5), between Savitr and Pusan (IX 81 4), and between Soma and Savite (III 56 6, X 149 5) BERGAIGNE further emphasises the hermaphrodite nature of Sayitr (III 38 8) remarking that Savitr combines in himself the characteristics of both sexes These are however, merely stray references, which obviously do not indicate the true nature of Savits. It may be that Savitr in his different capacities, as the benefactor who distributes wealth as the creator of the universe and the sustaider of the world order, as the nourisher of the crea tures, etc, has been brought into close association with several Vedic gods This fact shows that the nature of Savits is not identical exclusively with the nature of any one of these gods but that it definitely includes and transcends the distinctive features of all these gods
The above discussion will clearly indicate how the explana tions regarding the true nature of Savitr proposed by OLDEN BERG, HILLEBRANDT, MACDONELL, THOMAS, ROTH, and BERGAIGNE are either one sided and incomplete or definitely beside the mark 17 A critical consideration of the views of these scholars has, however, lcd us so far to the following main conclusions

(1) Sayitr is not merely an abstraction dividity of the type of Dhātr, Netr etc It is therefore, not necessary to assume that Sayitr belongs to a later phase of the Vedic religious thought and that, therefore, the conception underlying that god cannot be taken back beyond the Vedic mythology
(2) The view that Savitr was originally conceived of as being identical with Surya is a misconception, which has originated on account of the fact that the main function of Savitr, namely, * stimulation , is seen to have been attributed, to a restricted extent, also to the sun god As a matter of fact, however, the Vedic poets have clearly differentiated between these two gods
(3) The word sayitr is not always an epithet of a general character, so that it can be applied to any god in his capacity of * enlivener&rsquo; More commonly, there is a specific divine persona lity possessing its own essential nature which is presupposed by the name Savitr
What then is the essential nature of Savit? In order to understand it correctly, we have to analyse the eleven entire hymns addressed to that god and the 170 references made to him in the RV in such a way that only those characteristics of his personality are brought together which clearly distinguish him from other Vedic gods It is an indisputable fact that the Vedic poets are often in the habit of using stock phrases with reference to any and every god This their propensity has given rise to the innumerable repetitions in the Veda pointed out by BLOOM FIELD These common poetic formulas do not usually help us in estimating the character of a particular Vedic god We have, therefore, to base our views regarding the true and intrinsic nature of any god on the study of the nrvids or the exclusive characteristics mentioned in connection with that god
A very prominent feature of the nature of Savite is that the concept of the world order-rta – 15 often predominantly associa ted with his personality Sayıts is the god who supports and sustains the whole world &ndash; Jatha višian bhuanan dharaj ısjali (IV 54 4) He is suid to be mainly responsible for maintainingTHE VEDIC GOD SAVITR

the world order and the ethical laws, so much so that he is regarded as setting the standard in that connection ripoñcásah krilatı yrata esan dena na sana sarjadharmā (X 34 8) or dera na sauta satyadharmendro na tasthau samare dhananām (X 139 3) Waters are subject to the ordinance of Savit. ápas cid asja vrata â nimrgrā (II 38 2), that achievement of Savır is, indeed, idestimable (III 38 8), the wind stops in his movement 10 obedience to Savitr&rsquo;s Tralo ay am cid võio ramale paruman (11 38 2), Savitr has fixed the erstwhile flying moun tains (IV 54 5), all great gods have to act up according to his law na jasj endro iarno na mitro vratamaryamā no minantı rudrah (II 38 9), Savits assigns to Indra and other gods their abodes in mountains (IV 54 5), other gods follow Savitr&rsquo;s lead; no god dare resist his ordinance (II 38 7,9, V 82 2), various gods carry out their distinctive functions only under the stimula 1100 given by Savitr (V 81, X 139 1) Whatever Savitr, the god of beautiful hands, orders cannot be contravened or trans gressed, his law stands as eternal truth

These references to Sayitr in various Vedic passages provide us with a definite starting point for ascertaining the true nature and personality of that Vedic god In a very large number of passages, Savitç is associated with the concept of rta It has beco indicated above that already a stage had been reached in the

which he is said to be bearing in his hand ( IV 53 2, 132, 14 2) are surely indicative of his royalty Savits bestows immortality and other blessings not only on the Rbhus (1 110 3), but also on other gods (IV 54 2, 5, 6, V 81 1) Varuna is also called the wise guardian and bestower of immortality (VIII 42 2) The descriptions of Savitr as leading the dead to their respective places (X 17 4) and his mention in connection with funeral rites (AV XII 2 48 Satapatha Br XIII 8 3 3 ) would remind one of the close association of Varuna with Yama ths god of the dead (X 14 7) Further Sayitr 16 like Varuna, the dispeller of bad dreams (V 82 4 )
Two more features of the essential nature of Savity remind us of Varuna&rsquo;s personality Varuna, as the sovereign lord of the universe and as the preserver of 19w, is usually associated with pāśas or fetters He uses them in a two fold manner He binds down the world by means of these fetters, so that it should not Swerve from its well defined course, he also binds, with these fetters, the offenders who break his law (1 24 15, 25 21, VI 74 4, X 85 24) Savits is similarly described as binding down the world with fetters in order that the cosmic order should be preserved intact

The Nighantu gives the word amatı as a synonym of rūpa, 19 GELDNER 20 and NEISSER&quot; understand it in the sense of &ldquo;pecu har form, pattern, or structure” The word rūpa bas retained, in later literature, the sense of a mystical, occult form&rsquo; A critical study of the passages, where the word amatı occurs, leads one to the conclusion that, to the Vedic poet, anatı denoted some mighty splendour - a magical form - sometbing almost like the mājā of Mitrāvarunau (V 63 4 ) 22 It is very often descri bed as a supernatural miracle Thus fact brings Savitr and Varuna quite close to each other Varuna, like Savits, is said to be possessing such magical power (III 61 7, Y 85 5), by means of which he and Mitra make the sun cross the sky and obscure it with cloud and rain (V 63 4) So the epithet, maym, is primarily applied to Varuna among the gods (VI 48 14, VIL 28 4, X 99 10) The concepts of amat and mayā are quite Similar and belong primarily to the Varuna mythology The counterparts of Varuna in other ancient mythologies are also invested with such magical power This magical power, amatı or māya, is a necessary constituent of the whole rla ideology BERGAIGNA has pointed out,23 in this connection, that the acti. vity suggested by the root sū is very often (X 99 7, 137 4, AV VI 119 3, VIL 53 6) characterised by some form of mystical or magical power The root su denotes not just ordinary stimu lation, but stimulation which has some form of magic underlying it — a sort of magical charging' The root sű is sometimes used in this sense also with reference to Varuna himself (11 28 9) Savitr, whose activity is described by the employment of several forms of the root sū, is, therefore, clearly the world magician, whose ways regarding the direction and control of the world order are entirely impenetrable to the human mind
It ibus becomes abundantly clear that Savity is only an aspect of Varuna, a Hypostase' of Varuna He represents the

world sovereign Varuna as seen from a distinct point of view and in a distinct attitude What is this peculiar aspect of Varuna, which is so much glorified by the Vedic poets through the hymns addressed to Savitr ?
An analysis of the Vedic hymns addressed to Savitr brings forth very prominently one unique feature of the personality and activity of that god In the descriptions of Savitr, the movement of his hands and fingers is particularly emphasised by the Vedic poets la the case of no other Vedic god is this feature so conspi cuously noticeable Savitr raises aloft bis strong golden arms which extend to the ends of the whole world ( II 38 2, IV 14 2, 53 4, VI 71 5, VII 45 2) His arms are golden (1 35 9-10), broad (II 8 2), and beautiful (III 33 6) By his out stretched hands Savitr blesses and enlivens all beings and directs all movement in the world The raising of arms by Savits is so characteristic that a similar action on the part of other gods is often compared with it Agni raises his arms like Savitr (1 95 7), Usas extends light as Savitr extends his arms (VII 79 2), Brhaspati is implored by means of hymns of praise upraised like the arms of Savitr (I 190 3) Savitr is supānı (III 33 6), prthupanı (11 38 2), hiranyapanı (I 35 9), hıranyahusta (1 35 10), svangur (IV 54 4), etc In the Tautt Sam (IV 1 6 3) too it is said devastya savito &rsquo;d vapalu supanih svangurih subalur uta sakty This peculiar gesture of Savitr by means of his huge golden hands was so deeply rooted in the mind of the Vedic poet that, even in the later brahmanic literature the constellation hasta was regarded as sacred to Savitr presumably in accordance with the bandhuta ideology 24 BERGAIGNE rightly observes that the raising of the arms by Sayitr does not represent merely the spreading of the rays of the sun This gesture on the part of Sayitr, which is so often and so promigently described, must have had some special and deeper significance By his widely stretched out arms Savitr gathers together the beings and then lets them

(The concept of the world sovereign, with the gaiat hands reaching to the ends of the sky upraised in a gesticulation of ordering and producing magic cannot be said to have been restricted only to the Vedic mythology According to GUNTERT, it may be discovered in other ancient mythologies also lo this connection, he has set forth the evidence derived from nordic rock paintings 27 These paintings show a manly form with an axe in the right hand, which he raises up together with his left hand (a rock painting from Backa near Brastad) A similar figure is also represented in a rock painting from Kinnekule By the side of the figure there is the wheel of the sun' and the &lsquo;foot print&rsquo; In this representation, the right hand appears so very big when compared with the left that one is inclined to think that the representation must be that of some mythological figure The two gigantic bands in an upraised position, with particularly distinctive five fingers on each of them, are to be seen in a prehistoric figure of a god represented in a painting from Brecke Dear Brastad in a painting from Tanum one sees the god with both the gaint hands upraised, the right one bearing a spear The spear seems to be indicative of power and soverei gnty It is undoubtedly a representation of a god who gives orders in this peculiar attitude Similar figures of the god &lsquo;with majestic hands&rsquo; are also discovered in Southern Russia and the Caucasus region On a rock painting from Backa near Brastad

in Bohuslān, the god with big hands is represented as holding a long rope in his bands This feature is clearly indicative of the fact that the god of huge majestic hands - prihupanı Sayır – is identical with the god possessing a long rope - that is, Varuna with his fetters It is thus suggested that the mythological concept of Vedic Savitr is represented pictorially on the nordic rock-paintings belonging to the ancient bronze age 21

<p>Paradoxical as it may seem, one will all the same be justified in saying that the Vedic researches have been the earliest and the richest among the indological researches and still the unsolved Vedic problems are the greatest in number among the indologi cal problems Particularly the field of Vedic mythology cannot be said even now to have been fully and satisfactorily exploited Varuna, for example is the most august and greatly elevated divinity in the pantheon of Vedic gods and still his essential character remains enigmatic This paradox may appear to be still more striking! What is it that gave Varuna the exalted position which he holds in the Rgveda (RV)? Why, in spite of the comparatively small number of hymns dedicated to his praise, is he regarded, by the side of Indra, as the greatest of the gods of the RV? Why, again in certain cases, is he represented as being far superior to Indra - sometimes even as the God among gods?</p>
<p>Broadly speaking any hypothesis regardiog the essential nature of a Vedic god, in order to be proper and correct, should fulfil the following conditions</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) We should be in a position to present, on the basis of that hypothesis, a complete picture of that god as far as possible consistent with his essential characteristics as described in the Veda, his peculiar relation with other Vedic gods and the main conceptions with which he is associated in a special way in the Veda</li>
<li>(2) From the point of view of the bustacy of religion, the hypothesis should normally make it possible to connect that god satisfactorily with the Indo European (IE) religious thought, If, however, the conception underlying that god were to be regarded as being the result of foreign influence or as being purely an indigenous growth, that fact too should be historically explainable</li>
<li>(3) The hypothesis should further make it possible to account reasonably for the later modifications in the nature of that god in the classical Indian mythology
(4) Finally, the hypothesis should be based on sound philological grounds Since mythology is but an old form of language, all conclusions regarding the god&rsquo;s personality should be corroborated by definite linguistic facts
It is intended here to make a fresh approach to the Varuna problem on these lines
Let us first try to present, in a general way, a connected picture of Varuna and his greatness, through a constructive analysis of the Vedic hymns directly addressed to him as well as of other Vedic references 1
Varuna is preeminently called the asura (I 35 7, II 27 10, VII 65 2, VIII 42 1 ) and is often glorified as the upholder of the cosmic law, rta (1 23 5) He is riasya gopā or stavan par excellence His Ordinances are constantly said to be fixed, which fact gives him the significant title, dhrtavrata He is the regulator of waters (II 28 4, V 85 6, VII 64 2), indeed, all natural phenomena are controlled and directed by this god The gods themselves follow Varuna&rsquo;s law (VIII 41 7) and are incapable of obstructing in any way the proper functioning of that law The divine dominion of Varuna is often referred to with the word maya, magic power On account of this mājā, Varuga wields supreme sovereignty over the whole universe, which is said to have been originally created by hum He is the imperial ruler, samraj, of all, both gods and men (X 132 4, JI 27 10). of the whole world (V 85 3), and of all that exists csen the

slightest activity in nature and in human and animal life passes unnoticed by him The rising and the setting of the sun, the falling of rains, the growth of vegetation, the flowing of rivers, the flying of birds, even the winking of the eye are governed by the subtly working law of Varuna In his capacity of the world sovereign, Varuna is said to be commanding a large band of spies (1 25 13, VI 67 5, VII 61 3, 87 3), who, being undeceived, undismayed, and wise, observe keenly all the happen ings in the universe and report to their master, without delay, any cases of lapse from and transgression of that taw The overlord, Varuna, himself has the sun for his eye (I 115 1, VI 51 1, VII 61 1), so that he can supervise unobstructedly the happenings in the universe and the activities of human beings Varuna&rsquo;s golden abode is in the highest heaven (V 67 2), there he occupies his seat, which is great, very lofty, and firm on account of a thousand columns It is the duty of the all seeing sun, together with other spies, to go to the dwelling of Varuna and report the deeds of men (VII 60 1) Varuna 18 the un failing witness of men&rsquo;s truth and falsehood (VII 49 3) He perceives all that exists between the heaven and the earth and all that is beyond, none can escape from Varuna by fleeing even far beyond the sky (AV IV 16 4-5)
This vast expanse of the world is not an irregular chaos It 1s bound down by the päća (or pašas) of Varuna into a well regulated whole It is cosmos The law of Varuna, rta, works in a subtle but most effective manner throughout the universe This is, indeed, the māja of the great asura! And if any perpe. trator of crime against this cosmic law and, by logical extension, also against the moral law, is found, he is forthwith punished with the pasa of Varuna The pāća of Varuna, which thus seems to be serving a double purpose, is positively an exclusive feature of that god The great asura is, therefore, approached in great awe, and prayers for mercy are addressed to him but this world sovereign, characterised by all the glory of an oriental ruler, is often very relentless in matters partaining to the proper conduct of his law It is Varuna who creates the universe and
ASURA VARUNA
31
guards the cosmic law As a moral governor also Yaruna stands far above any other deity He is the strongest barrier against every type of falsehood This ethical idealisation is perhaps the most outstanding feature of Varuna&rsquo;s personality His epithets, asura, māyın dlirtavrata, rtaran, etc, point to his same essential nature
Another significant peculiarity of Varuna is his special asso ciation with Mitra and the Adityas Mitra and Varuna are often inseparably bound to each other, and Varuna is represented, in the Veda, as the highest among the Adityas Together with them he forms an independent circle of Vedic divities, to whom is principally entrusted the guardianship of law, cosmic and moral Their main characteristic is not the achievement of enormous exploits, as in the case of Indra, they govern the law which regulates the whole universe A very strikiøg parallel of this circle of Vedic gods is found in the Avestan religion where Ahura Mazdah Mithra, and Amesa Spentas also form a similar group
They too represent the supreme heavenly sovereignty
The eminence of Varuna as the creator of the universe, as the world sovereign, as the protector of law, and as the moral governor of mankind, had developed, in the Veda, to such an enormous extent that there naturally arose a unique risalry for supremacy between him and Indra, the other paramount god of the Vedic pantheon Several Vedic references are indicative of this rivalry which forms unquestionably one of the most impor tant features of the Vedic mythology It may be mentioned in this context, that in marked coatrast with Indra and many other Vedic gods, Varuna has do myths related to him, consequently, the anthropomorphism of his personality is more fully developed on the moral spiritual ratber than the physical side
The personality of Varuna is shrouded, in the Veda, with a mysterious and majestic grandeur His upapproachable magni ficence and awe inspiring power, his inexorable austerity and incomprehensibly divine wisdom inspire tlie Vedic seer to an anxious but commanding worship and self abnegation rather than
32
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
to expressions of frank and friendly confidence All traces of human weakness that are clearly perceptible in the character of Indra are copspicuously absent in Varuna&rsquo;s character The seer of a Vedic passage seems to have summarised substantially the true Vedic character of Varuna when he says of him, sato asja rāja (VII 87 6 )
What conclusions regarding the personality and the essential nature of Varuna can be drawn from the Vedic evidence adduced above? Does Varuna represent any power of nature, and, if so, which? Can we trace the conception underlying this god to other IE religions? How did the personality of this god develop in the later Hindu mythology ?
Before directly approaching these problems regarding the Vedic god Varuna, in a constructive manner, we may begin by critically examining the several earlier theories about Varuna by applying to them the tests mentioned above
The most common view, put forth by scholars like ROTH, DARMESTETER HOPKINS, BOHNENBERGER, L VON SCHROE DER, and BLOOMFIELD, 15 to regard Varuna as the sky god Even HILLEBRANDT had originally subscribed to this view, though he lates on revised his opinion This theory is mainly based on the name Varuna, wluch is derived by these scholars from the root vr, to cover' or &lsquo;to encompass&rsquo; To the simple minds of the ancient people, it was argued by them, the sky actually seemed to be covering or encompassing the earth and all that it contained Those apcient people accepted unhesita tingly the impressions conveyed to them by their senses, and the blue vault of the sky was for them actually a vault, solid and

immutable, covering everything It was further belicved that this theory was substantially corroborated by the apparent identity from the linguistic point of view, or the two names, Varuna and Ouranos, the Greek sky god Varuna was according to these scholars, none other than the Vedic counterpart of Greek Ouranos There was, howcier, already one sky god in the Vedic pantheon, namely Dyaus This god can be shown, on the strength of plulological and mythological evidence, to have been common to almost all IE religions What then was the necessity of a second sky god ? SCHROEDER explains this contidgency by saying that Dyaus and Varuna represent two different aspesis of the sky Dyaus represents the bright and shining day sky, while in Varuna, the pervading and the all encompassing nature of the sky is particularly emphasised Varuna may be said to be the * firmament' in contrast to Dy aus, who is the shining sky Since this encompassing or pervading nature is conspicuously realisable through the starry vault of the night sky, Varuna is closely associated with the night in RV hymns It is suggested by SCHROEDER that when the Indians and the Iranians lived together as one common cultural group they glorified a sky god as the creator of the unnerse Varuna and Ahura Mazdal, whose common mythological heritage can hardly be questioned, represent two tadependent developments of this original Aryan god RV passages like

Subhe ham || (VII 87 5) would however clearly indicate that the Vedic Varuna is defini tely closer in conception to that original sky god of the Aryans

Ahura Mazdah, on the other hand, was, in later times, greatly spiritualised and idealised by Zarathusthra in his reform move ment BORTHOLOMAE, DARMESTETER, EGGERS, and SPIE. GEL maintain, all the same that Ahura Mazdah also is the abstraction of the idea of sky In Avesta, varena is the name of a mythological land which is said to be cathrugaosha The linguistic affidity between the words, varuna and varena, is supposed to be quite evident This mythological locality, it is suggested, is to be identified with the expanse of the sky with its four corners' It may be remembered, in this connection, that, in the Veda Varuna too is said to be caturanika 5 This was considered to be another piece of evidence in favour of the sky. theory Attempts have also been made to connect the word varuna linguistically with Armenian (Arm ) garun which means the bright sky to the course of time, however, there began, in the evolution of the Vedic religious thought, the process of spiri tualisation, which all nature gods had to undergo at some stage of their career Varuna thereby rose from the sky' to be the
god of the sky, presiding over all the natural phenomena of which the sky is the foundation and the scene, and, in the later development, he finally came to be regarded as the supreme embodiment and guardian, as well as the maker, of the law which controlled those phenomena of nature The transition from the guardianship of the cosmic order to that of the moral order was then merely a matter of logical extension? The sun 15 described, in the Veda, to be the eye of Varuna (1 115 1, VI 51 1. VII 61 1), this could be best understood only if Varuna were

regarded as the sky god MAX MULLER recognises in the physical Varuna only the starry' night side while KNAUER, who connects the name Varuga with varna, black colour,' emphasises darkness' as the main characteristic of that god and therefore identifics Varuna with the might sky' of the ur IE period
It must be said with regard to this theory, which primarily identifies Varuna with Greek Ouranos and thus regards him as a sky god, that it is based on a fundamentally incorrect etymo logy It will be found that all derivatives in the u themes, from the root vr, *to cover', with which the Gk word, Ouranos, is usually philologically connected, always show a long vowel for wystance, Sk 10711189, vani77), suha, as also Gk For, rāter, erulo If, therefore, the word varuna were to be derived from the

Apart from this basic etymological flaw, the sky-theory further suffers from anotber grave defect, pamely, that it caonot fully and rationally explain the special characteristics of Varuna as described in the Veda. The foremost difficulty in this connec tion arises from Varuna&rsquo;s close association with Mitra and the Adityas. Even in the Boghazköi inscription the reference to Varuna is made as ù-ru-Wa-na-as-ši-el, meaning * Varuoa together with his group'. So also, Ahura Mazdah is praised in the Avesta as being constantly associated with Mithra agd the Amesa Spentas. This conception of a special circle of divinities over which Varuna seems to have presided would not fit in properly into the sky-theory. Further, even on the assumption that Mitra primarily represents the sun-god - this assumption will be later on shown to be positively wrong-, the pairing of Mitra and Varura would appear to be without any special significance. The plea put forth by SCHROEDER14 in this connection, namely, that the sun and the sky always appear together and may therefore form a pair of constant companions, is not at all convincing. Further, how can one explain, in that case, the contrast between Mitra and Varuna, so clearly implied in a large number of Vedic passages, such as nitro ahar ajanayad varuņo rătrim (TS VI. 4. 8. 3)? Moreover nowhere else in the Vedic literature does one find any indication of a dual divinity like Dyāvāsüryau, which would correspond with Mitrāvarunau. It is interesting to aote bere that SCHROEDER himself later on felt inclined to give up the hypothesis that Mitra represents the sun-god.15
The rivalry between ladra and Varuņa, which certainly was &amp; favourite theme of the Vedic poeis, will become meaning less if Varuna is made to represent the sky-god. Whether, in</li>

the naturalistic interpretation of the Vedic mythology, which is, by the way, not necessarily always correct, Indra is to be regarded as the sun god or as the storm-god, one fails to under stand why there should be any rivalry between him and the sky god! Further the Vedic passages adduced in support of the sky theory, such as, isra dyavo mikita antarasmin (VII 87 5) and iri sa pavitra hrdy antarī dadhe (IX 73 8 ), are of such a general tenor that one comes across similar passages with reference to dividities, who are hardly ever represented as sky-gods, like Savits (I 35 6) or Paranya (VII 101.4) or Aditya ( AV XII 2 3)17 On the other hand, one may consider with advantage the following Vedic passages referring to Varuna : ala sindhum iaruno dyanrıla sthad drapso na sveto mrgastus
usmān (VII 876) sa samudro apiczasturo dj amra roları sa mâjā arcınā
padastrnānnakam áruhat (VIII 41 8) Are the phrases djalit na sthad, drapso na Svetah, djam na rohati, and näham arular, in any way indicative of the sky? Can the sky be called apicyah samudrah? How is it further possible to explain, with the sky-hypothesis, the Vedic passages where Varuna is connected with Yana (X 14 7), with manyu (X 84 7), with sraia (1 24 10), and with dhurti (I 128 77

the sky What again are we to understand by the pasa of Varuna, according to this theory? It must be remembered at the same time that in later Indian literature we hardly find any trace of Varuna representing the sky It will be thus seen that none of the above mentioned four conditions is even slightly fulfilled by the sky theory, which fact therefore, renders that theory unacceptable Other modifications of this theory, such as that Varuna represents the ur IE Dight sky (KNAUER )or that he represents the starry vault of the sky' (MAX MULLER )18 may now be dismissed without any further discussion
Io his work on legal literature of ancient India, J J MEYER has suggested that Varuna is principally the god of night 18 The sins and crimes are usually perpetrated during the night time, and, as the god of night it is Varuna&rsquo;s function to prevent them It is in this way, argues MEYER, that Varuna becomes the moral governor of mankind Another quite a novel theory about Varuna is put forth by JOHANSSON 10 his very thought provoking monograph on the Vedic goddess, Dhisanā He believes that the names Varuna and Vitra are derived from the same idg form *uel lu, to bind' &lsquo;to keep under chains&rsquo; This fact would indicate the commonness of their nature According to JOHANS SON, Varuna and Vitra are the two aspects of winter, which keeps the waters of rivers in bondage - one of them being the divine aspect and the other the demonaic !&rdquo; BERGAIGNE too claims an especially tenebrous character for Varuna He sees in him a clear identity with Vrtra, who is the &lsquo;restrainer&rsquo; of waters 21 Varuna&rsquo;s pāśa is, according to BERGAIGNE, indicative of the tying down of waters The rivalry between Varuna and Indra is, therefore, only another aspect of the conflict between Vrtra and

As SORENSEN has rightly pointed out22 while contradicting the identification of Varuna with Vrtra, Varuna is represented, in the Veda, as the lord and friend of waters, and not even the slightest bint is given to the effect that he prevents them from flowing, as Vitra does Further, a critical examination of the Vedic hymns would yodicate that Vstra and Indra on the one hand and Mitra and Varuna on the other belong to two distinct strains of my thology Though, therefore, the names Vrtra and Varuna may possibly have been derived from the same root, the conceptions underlying them have to be thoroughly distinguished from each other from the point of view of content as well as of the history of religion Moreover, a mere reference to some of the outstanding features of Varuna, as described in the Veda, would suffice to disprove completely such views as have been put forth by MEYER and JOHANSSON The very suggestion that either the god of night or the winter god could be raised to such an exalted position in any religion is preposterous These and such other theories23 seem to disregard completely the evidence of the Veda, they do not take into account the logical development of

OLDENBERG comes forth, as usual, with a refreshingly Original theory in regard to Varuna,2 The physical representa tieas of Varuna, Mitra, and the Adityas bear, according to him, several distinct attributes of light The same is the case with

Evidently both JOHANSSOV and Meyer are not quite sure about the essen. tal nature and personality of Varuna They do not seem to reconstruct the picture of the Vedic Varuna in a synthetical manner from the special and exclusive attributes of that god Particularly MEYER appears, of recent years, to hre been considerably influenced by the vegetation fertility Conception. In bis recent book, Tnlogie der altindischen Alächte, he interprets Lama, Bals, and Indra as ancient Indian gods of vegetation and fertility
Sfention may also be made of the theory put forth by N N GEOSE (The Argan Trail in India and Iran, 91-32) that Mitra and Varuna were origi nally an inseparable par like Afying and that they represented the same twin principles of Light and Moisture According to CEOst, these twin principles were worshipped under different designations amongst different tribes of Proto Aryan grassiand nomads Fic further maintains that, through fusion of tribes, Matra and Varuna Lecaine maintainers of Law Obyiously the Vedic evidence cannot be und to le, 18 any way, sulsaslatag thus theory,

regard to the corresponding circle of dividities in the Aiesta, namely, Ahura Mazdalı, Mithra, and the Amesa Spentas OLDEN BERG starts with the assumption that the fact that Mıtlıra of the Avesta definitely represents the sun god is unchallengeable The Vedic counterpart of Mithra, pamely Mitra, must, therefore, necessarily be the sun god Though independent references to Mitra are not many in the RV, stil OLDENBERG claims to find faint traces of his identity with the sun god even in the existing material In III 59 for instance, general expressions have been used which indicate, according to OLDENBERG, without any specific mention, the connection of Mitra with the sun More direct references in this connection are found in the AY
sa varunah saj amagmirbhayati sa miro bhanati pratarudyan
(AV XIII 3 13 ) Tarunena samubitam mitrah pratarry ubjatu ( AV IX 3 18) In the Bralınana literature there are numerous passages of a similar tenor, where Varuna is said to belong to the night and Mitra to the day Ritualistically Varuna is connected with black animals and Mitra with bright coloured animals (eg TS II 191, 2,3 14) The common concept of day and night - correspon ding with Mitra and Varuna respectively - repeats itself very often in the sacrificial formulas The essential nature of Mitra as the sun god is thus confirmed according to OLDENBERG, by Vedic as well as Avestan literary and ritualistic evidence Varuna is the constant companion of Mitra, the association of Mitra with Varona is so common that only one single hymn of the RV is addressed to Mitra alone OLDENBERG S line of argu mentation is as follows There is in the Vedic mythology a compact group of seven mutually connected gods namely, the Adıyas, who are conspicuously dependent upon sky and light Two from among them, Mitra and Varuna, have assumed more preeminent positions One of these two namely Mitra, is definitely the sun god, while the other one, Varuna has the features of a god of light with special reference to pight over which he is said to rule What else can he possibly represent of pot tbe moon? Thc logical extension of the hypothesis that Mitra is the sun god
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
and Varuna is the moon god, naturally, is that the Adityas repre sent the planets
Besides this hypothesis there is also another side to OLDEN BERG&rsquo;s theory The glorification of the sun, the moon, and the planets as a compact group of mutually connected gods, which is to be seen in the Veda and the Avesta cannot be traced back to any other IE religion There are, therefore, two possibilities regarding the genesis of this religious conception Either the lado Iranians themselves created this group of gods in their own common religious fervour, or they borrowed those divinities from a foreign religion OLDENBERG believes that the rather unique circle of the Adityas, with Varuna and Mitra as the foremost among them, is more or less foreign to the pantheon of Vedic gods, which is presided over by the Asyan national war god, Indra According to him the Indra Vrtra mythology is genuinely Aryan while the Varuna Mitra mythology has been implanted in the Vedic religion from outside Is it not probable, he asks, that this unique group of gods was borrowed by the Indo Iranians from the Semitic people (or the Akkadians) and that, from the very beginning it was only half understood by the borrowers ? The fact that the Semitic people were well versed in the science of astronomy and of numbers, from very ancient times, seems to support considerably this conjecture Moreover, there is much other evidence to show that the Semitic people had developed a sufficiently high type of civilisation before the Indo Tranjans came into contact with them The god Varuna, whom the Aryans are supposed to have borrowed from the Semitic mythology, does appear, by the side of the Aryan national god, Indra, as a representative of an older and distinctly higher culture
The apparent reasonableness and soundness of this moon theory of OLDENBERG may have been one of the factors which prompted HILLEBRANDT to revise his original views in the matter of the Varuna problem 25 His method of approach to this question was, however, diferent from that of OLDENBERG

He attempts to brng forth evidencc sopport of hus theory from within rather than from without One fact must, all the the same, be clearly recognised in both these cases - and that is certainly a defect in the process of theorisation - namely that OLDENBERG and IJILLEBRANDT first scem to form some idea about Varuna&rsquo;s original nature and then try to adduce evidence 10 support of that idca In other words, they seem to start with conclusions rather than end with them HILLEBRANDT considers the Vedic passages, such as

Visman (VII 87 6) sa samudro apiczasturo dyāmna roları sa māyā arcınā
padastrnannākamoruhot (VII 41 8), as clearly indicative of Varuna&rsquo;s identity with the moon Api cyah samudrah is, according to him, the usual epithet of the mood But more convincing evidence in this connection is to be
found in the ninth mandala of the RV In the passage,
rājño nu le jaruinasja vratan
brhadgabhiram sava sonia dhama/ Sucistaması priyo na mitro
daksayyo arjanielāsı soma || (I 91.3), Soma is compared with Mitra and Aryaman, the juxtaposition of te and varuṇasya in the first pada, on the other hand, clearly implies that Soma is here considered to be identical with Varuna, Sometimes even the name Varuna seems to have been used as a synonym of Soma, for instance,
tam marmrjānam malısam na sanās
amsum duhanty uhsanam geristham / tam alasanam nalajah sacante
trito bibhartı sarunam samudre // (IX 95 4) Further, Soma and Varuna are often described as kan in the Vedic hymns The following stanzas addressed to Varuna and to Soma exlubit an astounding similarity of conteats and expression :

(VI 70 1) (to Soma) ni jastastanibha rodası (IX 101 15) In ritual also at the beginning of the Agnistoma sacrifice, Soma is treated as Varuna The sovereignty of Varuna is perfectly identical with that of Soma A considerable amount of Vedic literary and ritualistic evidence can thus be adduced to indicate that in the minds of the Vedic thinkers, Varuna and Soma were quite identical HILLEBRANDT claims to have proved, finally and convincingly, that Soma represents the moon 26 &ldquo;The logical conclusion, therefore, is that Varuna also represents the moon
This fact is amply corroborated, according to HILLEBRANDT, by the wealth of material in the Vedic hymns as well as in the Vedic ritual,27 which is indicative of the contrast between Mitra and Varuna It must be remembered that HILLEBRANDT unhesita tingly accepts the identification of Mitra with the sun god 28 He, however, believes that Ahura Mazdah of the Avesta has nothing to do with Varuna (VM II, 8-10) Otherwise, he argues, the name Varuna would have been retained in the Iranian language in some form or another The probable question with regard to the moon theory, namely, why Abura Mazdah does not show, in the Avesta, even the faintest traces of the moon god, has thus been anticipa. ted and answered away by HILLEBRANDT Much emphasis has been placed by him on the passages where Varuna is supposed to be described as &ldquo;bald, yellow eyed, whitish man, who stands among the waters and receives the offerings on his head. 29 Can there be, he asks, a more picturesque representation of the moon than this one? Varuna&rsquo;s association with the night is too evident to need special discussion A further peculiarity of Varuna is that he is connected with waters as well as with winter is the

moon pot described in a Vedic passage as the sender of rains ?30 There are thus three most prominent characteristics in the palure of Varuna - his connection with the night, his connection with waters, and his connection with winter The essential features of all these three are to be found together in only one entity, pamely, the moon Further, the dismal&rsquo;, &lsquo;dreary&rsquo;, and &lsquo;dark features 10 Varuna&rsquo;s personality can be adequately accounted for, according to OLDENBERG and HILLEBRANDT, only on the basis of the moon-hypothesis The unique idealisation of Varuna into a sovereign lord of the universe holding sway over all aspects of natural as well as human lifc necd not surprise anyone As pointed out by some scholars, the moon is glorified in many pamitive religions to the same extent as Varuna in the Veda 31 OLDENBERG mentions, 10 this connection, the indigenous Ameri can religions as well as the Finnish mythology, wherein the moon is regarded as the almighty god Even the hymn to Nannur, the moon god of Ur, quoted by SAYCC, would remind one of a prayer addressed to Varuna by the Vasisthas!
This theory, namely, that Varuna pamarily represents the mood, first propounded by OLDENEERG in his distinctive manner and later on accepted in their own peculiar ways by HILLE
BRANDT, HARDY, and others, is apparently quite sound and, therefore, may not be lightly set aside as being of no account But it cannot certainly stand a keen and critical examination Attention has already been drawn to the fundamentally defective method of approach on the part of OLDENBERG and HILLE BRANDT It is not the evidence of the Veda itself that has led these scholars to the hypothesis which they have put forth, their theory principally depends upon extraneous considerations, and they have only later on tried to adduce such evidence from the

Veda as would seemingly substantiate their hypothesis Apart from this, it niust be said that the very assumption, namely, that Mitra represents the sun god, which is the starting point of this theory, can be shown, on the strength of the evidence of compara tive philologv and comparative mythology, to be positively wrong
Let us pause here a little to consider the name Mitra and the conception underlying it Only one full hymn in the RV namely, III 59 - dedicated to the praise of this god exclusively The Vedic evidence on the whole seems to show that Mitra did not possess any individuality as such on the physical side His special characteristic feature is expressed, in the Veda, through the woris mitro jananyatayatı brın anah ( III 59 1) Mitra places men in their proper places, through his commands&rsquo; A clear hint is hereby given that Mitra has something to do with right&rsquo; and law' He is primarily jataj ajjana This idea is further confirmed by otber Vedic passages, which connect Mitra very significantly with dharman and rta

As against this, there is not the slightest evidence in the Veda to indicate that Mitra was originally the sun god Etymologie cally the original form of the word mitra scems to have been milram (neuter ) formed with the suffix tra, which, in its turn, is the modification of the IE instrumental suffix tro Other forma tions of a similar character are vrtram from the root vr, yotram from the root yu, and y antram from the root jam The base of the original IE form *mi tro m was the IE root *m(e)i-&lsquo;to bind&rsquo; The same root is clearly perceptible in the words, Sk mekhala, Lett meimuri, Gk mitos, mir girdle of the body.

Apart from this basic flaw, the moon theory is not at all supported by the evidence of the Vedic hymns To begin with, attention may be drawn to the impropriety of the sun being men tioned as the eye of the moon 41 Particularly when the physical Image of the moon was present to the eye of the Vedic poet, such references cannot be regarded even as poetical fantasy Further, it would be very difficult to explain, on the basis of the moon hypothesis, why Varuna, the moon, is regarded, in the Vedic hymns, as enormously more important than Mitra, the sun Indeed, so much richness of material, as we find with regard to the Vedic Varuna, should be impossible in the case of the moon To justify this contingency on the strength of the evidence of some p itwe rely ons, wheid iwe mou 13 apparently regarded as the almighty god,&rdquo; is to completely misunderstand the whol spirit of the Varuna religion The ideology underlying the Varuna religion is essentially different from the one underlyin

the primitive religions which are believed to have glorified the moon as the highest god One, indeed, feels that by the side of Indra, the national war god of the Vedic Aryans Varuna gives the impression of being a representative of an older and ethically more elevated culture Can Varuna&rsquo;s counterpart in the Avesta, Ahura Mazdah, be ever regarded as representing the moon 73 The unique kind of ethical idealisation from the cosmic point of view, which is the most outstanding feature of the essen tial nature of the Vedic Varuna as well as of Ahura Mazdah, becomes utterly meaningless in the moon theory Varuna&rsquo;s close association with ria and the rivalry between Varuna and Indra also caonot then be satisfactorily accounted for Do we further not find that in the Vedic mythology there do exist the proper sun god Surya, and the proper moon god Candramas? What then is the significance of this peculiar glorification of Mitra and Varuna as representing the sun and the moon respectively? Had Mitra and Varuna primarily represented the two natural pheno mena of the sun and the moon, the physical side of those gods would have been more distinctly emphasised in the Veda But as a matter of fact that is not at all the case! Further, it may be pointed out, in this connection that Varuna does pot play in the Vedic mythology, the same role as the moon in the classical Hindu mythology What again is the propriety of the meotion of Mitra and Varuna in the Boghazkoi inscriptions, if they merely Tepresent the sun god and the moon god respectively. They have been invoked with a special purpose and must have been regarded as having something to do with treaties and agreements The pasa, wbich forms an exclusive feature of Varuna, would create quite a major difficulty in the moon theory Soma is prima rily the sacred ritual drink, which fact would be quite clcar from the Vedic references The identification of Soma with the moon

can only be of a secondary character and may be regarded as the product of poetical fancy So HILLEBRANDT&rsquo;S assertion that Soma is essentially identical with the moon is quite unconvin cing Moreover, Varuna&rsquo;s apparent identity with Soma, which constitutes one of the main planks in HILLEBRANDT&rsquo;s hypothe sis,45 can be more adequately explained by assuming that it was perhaps a conscious attempt on the part of the later Soma priests to glorify Soma by bringing him into contact with Varuna, the world sovereign Finally the moon theory would appear to be utterly unacceptable if one took into consideration the Vedic passage where Varuna and Candramas are brought together as the governor and the governed, namely, adabdhani varunasya vratānı vicakaśaccandrama nakrametit I 24 10)
It is interesting to pote that the etymology of the name Varuna has been completely overlooked by the protagonists of the moon theory No other IE religion has glorified the moon god to such a great extent as, according to OLDENBERG and HILLEBRANDT, the Aryan relagion has Historically too this fact would become unaccountable OLDENBERG assumes that the whole circle of the Vedic gods - Mitra, Varuna, and the Adityas – representing respectively the sun, the moon, and the planets, as well as the corresponding circle of the Avestan divipities, Mithra Ahura Mazdah, and the Amesa Spentas, were borrowed by the Aryans from the Semitic people Tf the Aditya circle as a compact group were supposed to have been borrowed from the Semitic religion, there should have origically been such a group of divinities in that religion As a matter of fact, how ever, there is no such group! The planet-divioities in Babylon do not at all appear as a group of seven Moreover, the siogle planet divinities of the Semitic people, such as, Ninib, Nergal, Nebo, elc, have absolutely nothing in common with the Vedic Adityas, such as, Aryaman, Daksa, and Bhaga, or with the Ave stan Amesa Spentas, such as Vohu manah, Aša vahista, etc More over, the planets as such are regarded, in the Iranian religion,

more or less as evil spirits on the side of Ahriman 4 According to the hypothesis of OLDENBERG, Varuna would have to be regarded as being identical with Sun, the moon god of the Semitic people, and Mitra with šamaš, their sun god However, in the Babylonian mythology, Sın, in contrast to the Vedic Varuna, plays a very micor role, Varuna&rsquo;s personality, on the other hand. exhibits many features which are common to Samaš These facts clearly go against OLDENBERG&rsquo;s theory One conclusion, therefore, seems to be quite unchallengeable, namely, that the circle of the Adityas cannot hayc bcen borrowed from the Semitic mythology, since there is no such compact group of divinities in the Semitic mythology 47
The soundest method of understanding and evaluating the unknown Vedic mythological ficts is, according to PISCHEL, to start from the known classical Hindu mythology This method proposed by PiSCHEL is correct but it is certainly not the only method On the strength of the evidence of the classical Hindu mythology PISCHEL has put forth the theory that Varuna represents in the Veda, the god of ocean, as he does in later mythology 49 Varuna&rsquo;s connections with waters are many and varied in the Vedic literature (I 161 14, VIT 49 3, IX 90 2, AV VII 83 1) This fact would also confirm, according to him, the hypothesis that Varuna is primarily the lord of waters The following Vedic passage,
apsu te rājan larima grlo hranjajo muihah faro dirtarraro raja sarsa dhomāni muñicaru ( AV VII 83 1),
46 It may also be pointed out that the fatalistic tendencies which are usually associated with the planets are almost woknown among the tarly Aryans.

clearly points to the abode of Varuna being among waters. In this context a reference may also be made to the etymological connection, proposed by some scholars, between the words, varuna, on the one hand, and vari a river&rsquo; and vāri &lsquo;water&rsquo;, on the other.49 LUDERS seems to have modified the oceap-theory by regarding Varuna as representing originally the occan surroud. ing the world.50
Apart from the incorrectness of the etymological connection mentioned above, it must be said regarding this theory, that, according to the Vedic evidence, waters' or &lsquo;ocean&rsquo; represent only one region of Varuna&rsquo;s supreme sovereignty. It may also be pointed out that in no IE. religion is the god of ocean glorified as the world-sovereign, Moreover, it is positively doubtful whether the sea was at all regarded by the Vedic Aryans as of such great importance as to make its god the most august and the most paramount god of the Vedic pantheon. It is consequently difficult to accept the theory put forth by PISCHEL.51

underlies the word asura 53 The Vedic word asura is much older than the classical Sk word sura, asura does not represent the opposite of sura (= god That word was originally used in the Vedic literature in the sense of a beiog who possessed the largest amount of magical potence Its meaning, pamely
demon', belongs semasiologically to a later date, and it was then that the word sura god' was artificially coined through a misunderstanding of the a in asura as a prefix of negation Philo
logically the word asura is derived from asu by the addition of the possessive termioation ra I have shown elsewhere, 54 on the basis of philological and anthropological evidence, that asu must have been originally regarded as a supernatural fluid like the primitive Mana This fluid invested upon a being some super natural, magical potence, which belongs to the realm of the * invisible' and which is quite distinct from physical strength The magical power which comes from Mana may be utilised both for good as well as evil purposes To possess and to control the largest quantity of that all penetrating magic fluid was the greatest achievement ever thought of It should be remembered in this connection that the magic fluid postulated by the primitive is not what we may call ‘spirit', &lsquo;mind&rsquo;, or soul' It is a power substance which fills the living beings, but even the lifeless can have it magically filled in into them &ldquo;The Batak call such power substance Tondi, while the Huron-Indians call it Orenda The conception of Orenda, Tondi, Mana is the ultimate solution offered by the primitive to the riddle of life and being What is true of the Melanesians, Polynesians, Australian tribes, American Indians, African Negroes, etc, could also be true of the ancient Aryans 55 The primitive religions assumed the subtle working of Orenda in
53 In the present context the term &lsquo;magic is not to be understood in its vulgar, popular sense It is rather to be understood in the sense in which it is used when for instance one says that &lsquo;magc, relg on, and science are the three main stages in the evolution of human thought particularly in respect of man s relationship with the world [See DANDELAR, 14 PATOG, Part II, 1952 16 18 ]

māya, Varuna is, therefore, associated in a special way with the conception of māya
GELDNER derives the word māya from mirate, mināsı, or minoti, to lessen', &lsquo;to hinder&rsquo;, &lsquo;to injure: 59 This etymology would give that word a more or less negative sense, which, how ever, cannot be confirmed by the Vedic evidence Vedic referen ces indicate that the fundamental conception underlying the word maya is that of a secret, mysterious power, possessed by good as well as evil beings, and the capacity to achieve miracles, which are incomprehensible from the point of view of normal beings The well regulated working of the enormous natural phenomena is thus regarded as resulting from the māja of Varuna The word majā has to be derived from miman or mim te, which root does not only mean &lsquo;to measure&rdquo;, but also &lsquo;to create&rsquo;, &lsquo;to arrange&rsquo;, etc Maya thus represents the capacity to plan or to organise, mainly in the spiritual sense rather than in the technical sense As NEISSER has pointed out, 60 many Vedic passages actually connect the word maja with the root ma

The conceptions underlying the words, asura and niajā, throw a good deal of light upon the true personality of Varuna As the crcator and the constructor of the universe, Varuna is regarded as the awe inspiring and miracle working magician Many Vedic passages will amply corroborate this assumption For instance.

thc essential personality of Vacuna in the Veda quite clear Varuna is the great asura, who possesses the largest amount of the magic power-substance asut, and his māja, resulting from this fact becomes manifest in the creation of the incomprehensibly majestic miracle of the cosmos He is the magician creator of the world as well as its suprcmc sovereign This particular characteristic of the essential nature of Varuna is most pictures quely represented in his other aspect, namely that of the Vedic god, Savitr 62 It is evidently a gross mistake to try to identify Varuna with some power of nature
How does Varuna administer the cosmic law? The etymo logy of the name Varuna would considerably enlighten us on this question Attention has already been drawn to the fact that to derive the word varuna from the root ir to cover' is unsound from the linguistic point of view MEILLET derives the word varuna from the IE root *ller ure to speak 63 The word vrata is also derived from that root The possible connection between god Varuna and his commands - trala - is hereby linguistically suggested Varuna is accordingly the commander god MEILLET further connects the word laruna with Obg rota oath, Gk relor etc. It will however, be seen tbat there is no deriva tive from *uer ure in u themes, which fact would render the derivation of the word varuna from it unacceptable The word varund is best derived from *uer to bind' Other derivatives from that root are Lett Beru kert bind down, Obg veruga * chain', Lat urvum, etc It will thus be seen that there are also u derivatives from that root It may, therefore, be concluded that the name Varuda is derived from the IE *ueru n os &ldquo;the

binder 64 This etymology is amply corroborated by the pāśas attributed to Varuna and the whole religious thought dominated by thcm Thc supremc binder god Varuna binds down all phenomena in the universe by means of his pāśas and thereby controls and regulates their working (VII 84 2, X 149 1). He thus establishes cosmic order through his bondage 5
As a logical extension of this idea, Varuna, in his capacity of the world sovereign, of the upholder of the cosmic law, and of the moral governor, is represented to be employing his pāśa to put the singers against his law into bondage by way of punish ment (eg AV IV 16 6-9) The two currents of thought - cosmological and ethical – indicated above seem to have been blended together into the concept of the pasa of Varuna
An analysis of the concept of ria would prove very helpful at this stage It was BRUGMANN who may be said to have started the linguistic investigations in this connection 66 According to him, Gk eirën (or uranā) 16 the reduplicated derivative from the IE *ar to bind &lsquo;to upite , éto join together&rsquo; Th GK word eirune means &lsquo;well joined together, holy bond&rsquo;, &lsquo;deser bringing together&rsquo; Some further derivatives from that root, in different directions, are SK ara, aram, arpajall, Lat.

of rta is often said to have been spun out by means of threads of light:

upastutyam brhadiayah // (I 136 2) The Vedic concept of rta thus represents the same ideology as is more or less concretely persopiled ihrough Varuna The Iranian counterpart of rta will be clearly seen in asa, it would be particularly interesting to compare hham riasya with asahe xām (Y 10 4), riasāp with ašem aplı (Y 31 32), and redha rtasja with asayazdah GEIGER has shown that asa and druj of the Avesta are related to the Vedic rta and drh, which latter are clearly contrasted with each other (1 122 9 ) 68 GUNTERT believes that the concepts of rta and cosmos' are semasıo logically connected with each other since the word cosnios itself can be traced back to a root <em>ker meaning &lsquo;to bind together 69
It has been already pointed out that an outstanding feature of the Varuda religion is Varuna&rsquo;s connection with the Adityas and Aditi Here too one would find the same concept of binding&rsquo; underlying these two words The words adıtı and ādit, a are derived from the IE <em>de-Sk da to biod' and are linguistically connected with the words like Sk daman bondage' The whole world may be bound down by the fetters of Varuna, the world sovereign, but the Adityas, who are his favoured associates and who represent the different powers of the great asura Varuna, are naturally unbound and free 70 It may be incidentally pointed out that BLOOMFIELD&rsquo;s suggestion that the word aditya may be connected with the word ādı' beginning', and that thus the prime val character of those gods may be assumed 71 is philologically

unsound The Adityas belong to the entourage of asura Varuna; they may, under his behest, bind down others, but are themselves free from bondage It will thus be seen that Mitra the binder Varuņa &lsquo;the binder&rsquo;, rta &lsquo;holy bond&rsquo;, &lsquo;holy law&rsquo;, Adityas &lsquo;thc un bound Obes&rsquo;, and Aditi &lsquo;the unboundness belong to one and the same religious ideology which forms the fundamental basis of the Varuna religion in the Veda The unique affinity among these dividities often referred to in the Vedic bymns can be very satis factorily accounted for only by this hypothesis The whole circle of Mitra and Varuna seems to have been quite an ancient feature of the Aryan Teligion, since, in the Boghazkoi inscription of the 14th century BC, Varuna and Mitra are invoked not singly like Indra, but together with their groups 72
Varuna may thus be said to be representing the concept of the world sovereign who is characterised by those distinct features which are implied by the words, asura, majā, rta, mitra, adilja, aditi, etc This world sovereign further possesses all the attribu tes of royalty He is rajan (1 24 7), but more predominantly samraj (VII 822) Ksatra is said to be his special glory (1 25 5, VII 89 1-4) He wears a golden mantle and puts on a shining robe (1 25 13) The spies - spasah- of Varuna make his supreme sovereignty complete His imperial ordinances - Tratani - are unchallenged, and so he is dhrtavrata (1 25 6 ) The moral law governing the human beings, with which Varuna is often associa ted, is but an aspect of the cosmic law of which he is the principal guardian This regal aspect of Varuna&rsquo;s personality may throw come light on the Vedic notion of kingshup 3
72 It has becn pointed out by GUNTIRT ( Op ar, 151–55) that several other ancient peoples 1 ke, for instance, the Icelanders the &lsquo;Thrakians, and the Phrygians hasc glorified ther great god as &ldquo;binder Such are Bond, Darzales, and Dendis
73 JOHANSSON actually suggests (Opal, 130 ) that the concept of kingship Is itself personified as a god in Varuna It would however be top

The essential nature of Varuna is necessarily all comprehen sive Varuna s domain is, therefore, vast, and he is often severally represented as being almost identical with other Vedic dividities such as Soma, Yama, etc It must, however, be remembered that Varuna is not identical with any one of these, he includes and transcends them all in my paper entitled New light on the Vedic god Savitr, 74 I have shown that through the personality of Savitr a special aspect of Varuna - Varuna as a magician and Varuna as a commander - has heen glorified by the

The number of hymns dedicated to Varuna&rsquo;s praise is accor ding to MACDONELL not a sufficient criterion of his exalted character Hardly a dozen hymos celebrate him exclusively &quot; In two dozen more hymns, however, Varuna is invoked along with his double, Mitra These hymns, addressed to Mitravarunau as a dual divinity present Mitra and Varuna as two gods supplemen ting each other 6 A critical study of the Mitravaruna hymns often makes one feel inclined to accept the suggestion of BOH. NENBERGER that Mitra and Varuna originally formed one single godhead, which was later on split up into two and that, even then, Mitra was merely used as an attribute of Varuna 77 It has already been shown on etymological grounds that the essential character of both the gods is the same But there are certain points in this connection which cannot be overlooked Firstly, Mitra alone is celebrated only in one hymd, secondly, in the hymns addressed to Miträvarunau, Varuna is more preemineptly glorified than biis associate Mitra, and, tbırdly even in spite of his essential character as &lsquo;binder&rsquo;, Mitra does not possess any pašas while Varunas pašas, which serve a double purpose, are often glorificd (1 24 15, I 25 21, VII 88 7, AV IV 16 6ft) On the basis of this evidence a plusible hypothesis regarding the distinct

domains of Mitra and Varuna may be hazarded Bondage is of two types - by mcans of the bonds of friendship and by means of the bonds of subjection The first type of bondage is usually brought about between equals, while the second type of bondage implies the unchallengcable superiority of the binder Mitra presides over the bonds of friendship - agreements, contracts, and Ircatics Varuna produces through his pāšas an invisible net of magic in which the whole creation is held in bondage and is there. by controlled and regulated, Varuna also punishes the sinners against the cosmic and the moral law by means of his pašas As GUNTERT bas pointed out,</em></em> Mitra, as a friendly divinity, helps to bring about friendly bondage between man and man, and bet Ween god and man, he is particularly the guardian of human laus Varuna, on the other hand, presides over an all inclusive cosmic domiin, his Law includes all laws Morcover, it is also suggested in the Vedic hymns that one becomes conscious of his having broken the law of Mitra Varuna&rsquo;s 11w works in a very subtle way and there are often unconscious lapscs from it (V 85 8, VII 89 3, 5) It must, however, be remembered that this distinction between the domains of Varuna and Mitra is never forcefully emphasised in the Vcda. Indeed Mitra falls into the background and comes to be regarded merely as one of the Adityas Varuna dominates this particular aspect of the Vedic rcligion and Mitra is reduced to the position of his more or less subordinate double The later Vedic ritualistic literaturc desclop ed the originally slight distinction betneen the two gods in quite a different direction which fact give rise to a lot of misunder standing regarding their primary characters The original concep tions represented by Varunt and Mitra had no place in the scheme of the Vedic ritual, and conscquently their essential personalities were greatly modified so as to suit the ritualistic purpose

studied in the proper historical perspective The early Vedic religious thought shows three very marked phases
(1) The most ancient Aryan, who lived in very close proximity with nature - indeed, as a part of nature - , was struck by the vastness, brightness, and profuseness of nature He expressed his religious reaction to this experience through the mythological figure of Dyauh This aspect of what may be called the cosmic religion, however, suffered a retarded growth among the Aryans This was presumably due to the fact that the ancient Aryan chose to emphasise yet another remarkable feature of the cosmic phenomena and consequently mythologised it
(2) The ancient Aryan realised that this vast universe was not chaos but that it was cosmos, there was some law which regulated and controlled all phenomena of nature, and there was a sovereign lord who enforced the proper conduct of that law This second phase is represented by the Varuna rta conception
(3) This cosmic ethical phase of the religious thought of the ancient Aryans could not for long satisfy the religious urge of the fighting and conquering Vedic tribes The character of the religion of a people is largely conditioned by the kind of life which that people lives The fighting Aryans, accordingly, created a warrior god, Indra, who eventually surpassed all other gods
The RV hymn, IV 42, is a remarkable document relating to the revolution in the order of ranking among the gods, which seems to have taken place during the Vedic period it indicates the supersession of Varuna, who stood at the height of divine glory in the Aryan period, through Indra, the national war.god of the Vedic lodzes 79 The Jd selyous vider made pace for the

Dew one, on account of the changing circumstances of the Vedic people This assumption might explain why Varuna&rsquo;s counter part in the Avesta, Ahura Mazdah, continued to be glorified as the supreme god by the Iranians, there was no original counter part of lodra to rival bim in their religion In the Vedic period also there was a group of Vedic Aryans, particularly the Vāsi. sthas, who preserved and promoted the ancient Varuna religion At the same time, serious attempts seem to have been made by the Yāsisthas themselves to bring about a compromise between the Varuna religion and the Indra religion, which fact is reflected in the Vedic passages such as,
yrtränjanjah samithesu jiglinate yratanzanjo abhi raksate sada / (VII 83 9)
Indra&rsquo;conquers, but it is Varuna who rules B0 Thus there can be seen, in the Vedic hymns, three distinct phases of the relationship between Varuna and Iadra, namely, (1) Varuna&rsquo;s unchallenged supremacy among all the gods, (2) rivalry between the old Varuna-religion and the new Indra religion, and attempts to bring about a compromise between the functions of Varuna and Indra, and finally (3) Varuna&rsquo;s supersession through Indra and the consequent elevation of Indra to the position of the most precminent god of the RV All the same, the spirit of rivalry betwecn asura Varuna and irtrahā Indra characterises a large part of the Vedic literature and ritual si The difference in the esscotial nature of these two gods is reflected, as BERGAIGNE

has pointed out,82 in the very prayers addressed to them Indra is the ideal of a fighting and conquering people, as his very name would indicate he is the symbol of manly vigour and physical strength, he is often represented in the Veda as an inveterate divine bully, ever indulging in drinking and fighting He pos sesses all the virtues and also the weaknesses of a manly hero. Varuna, on the other hand, is represented as the highly spirituali sed and idealised protector of law In contrast to Varuna, Indra, as the national war god, was celebrated in a very large number of myths
The rivalry between Indra and Varuna would give us the necessary starting point for the consideration of the question of how the world sovereigo Varuna of the RV was transformed into the god of ocean in the classical Hindu mythology The deterio ration in Varuba&rsquo;s religious supremacy began with the ascendancy of Indra 83 What remained of his divine sovereignty, after Indra&rsquo;s rise, was divided among several gods Anindependent god came to be thought of as presiding over every region, over which Vacuna was represented in the Veda, to have ruled There remained only the ocean which came into prominence in later times The imperial ruler was reduced to the position of a provincial gover nor, Varuna became the god of ocean Varuna&rsquo;s special connec tions with waters described in the Veda (II 28 4, V 85 3, 6, VII 87 1, VIII 41 2, X 75 2, AV VII 83 1), the conception of the upper' ocean and the lower' ocean in the Vedic cosmography as also the belief that Varuna administered his

<p>One of the most intriguing problems of Indian mythology relates to the elevation of Visnu in the classical Hindu mythology to the prominent position of the supreme god from the more or less minor position which has been assigned to him in the Vedic mythology He cannot be said to have ever been regarded, in the Vedic religion, as a god of any consequence We do come across a few Vedic references to Visnu (II 1 3,22 1, 34 11 ) which seem to reflect his glory, but actually they are quite general and pointless in character and by no means indicate that Visnu ever dominated Vedic thought and faith, as for jostance, Varuna and Indra did Hymns in praise of Visnu are, indeed, very few, he is celebrated 10 not more than five whole hymns and in parts of others, while his name occurs only about a hundred times in the Rgveda (RV) Even in those stray passages, Vişnu is very casually mentioned among a crowd of other divinities He thus seems to have occupied a comparatively subordinate position in the pantheon of Vedic gods, from which he rose, more or less suddenly, to supreme eminence in Hindu mythology of all the Vedic gods, Visnu is perhaps the only god whose name is promi nently preserved in the Hindu Trinity
Is it possible to account for this rather unique mythological phenomenon on the strength of the evidence derived from the Veda itself? The assumption of certain scholars, like RAYA CHAUDHARI,&rdquo; that Visnu was a great god even in the earliest Vedic times is difficult to accept The statistical standard makes him out to be a deity only of the fourth rank At the same time, to assume that an ordinary god of the Veda, who was not much glorified in the hymns, became only in later times the god of ever increasing importance is unconvincing There are, accord 10g to MACNICOL, somс hints 10 the Brahmiana literature of the

progress which Visnu was making towards the position which he occupies later on But the mere fact that the Brahmanas speak of Visnu as being identical with the sacrifice and ask him to make good its defects does not necessarily indicate that Visnu was attaining eminence : Moreover, that assumption does not help the solution of the Visnu problem A workable hypothesis, in this connection, can be that there had been some elements in the original nature and personality of Vistu, which, at one time, ensured his position as an all important god, but that these elements were suppressed, perhaps consciously, by the Vedic poets and priests Visnu must have been a highly worshipped god even in very ancient times, but he must have been deliberately shoved into the background in the Vedic religion on account of some intrinsic characteristics of his essential nature which might have been disagreeable to the Vedic religious ideology Docs tbe available Vedic evidence corroborate this hypothesis to any extent?
Visnu&rsquo;s personality as represented in the RV is not rich in mythological details The outstanding features of the Visnu mythology in the Veda are mainly two namely, the three strdes which he is said to have taken in order to traverse the whole Udiverse and which are often glorified as the most distinctive achie vement of his, and, secondly, the help which he rendered to Indra at the time of the latter s fight with Vitra These events in the carcer of Visnu are mentioned, in the Vedic literature, sometimes As two independent achievements (I 154 2 3, 155 4-5. VII 100 3-5, VIII 29 7), and sometimes as connected with cach other
cosmic character attributed to Vişnu (1 154 1-2, VI 69 5, VII 99 2-3), but they are such as would be attributed to any Vedic god, as the result of the so-called henotheistic tendency in the Yedic religion, and may not be regarded as essentially distinctive of Visnu&rsquo;s nature Let us therefore, analyse the two above mentioned features of the Visnu mythology and see if they throw any light on the primary nature of Visay

VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
The first thing that would strike a crilical student of the Vedic mythology is that the association or Visnu and Indra in the RV is clearly superficial The help which Vinu is said to have given to the Vedic Aryan war god at the time of his glorious achievements of killing Vrtra and letting the waters frec' could have been casily dispensed with Thc hymas addressed to Indra and Visnu together are again positively colourless The later Vedic passages (TS VIS 1 1. II4 12) also indicate that Indra hardly depended on Visnu for his hclp at the time of slaying Vrtra Wc cycn sce that the steps of Visnu, which form his distinctic characteristic, are sometimes (VI 69 5) attributed also to Indra, thus clearly rendering Visnu supertluous The natural conclusion in this regard would, therefore, bc that Visnu&rsquo;s comradeship of Indra at the time of the Vitra fight, which is obviously artiâcial, is necessarily an afterthought Even from the point of view of the naturalistic interpretation of Vedic mytho logy, the coalescence of Visnu and Indra is, as pointed out by HILLEBRANDT,&rdquo; who, incidentally, is a strong advocate of such an interpretation, entirely without any significance What thca is at the bottom of this artificial bringing together of (wo intrinsically usconnected divinities? It is a well known practice of the Vedic poets to connect any sigoificant activity of any god with Indra and his achievements Indra was by far the most prominent god of the Vedic Indians As shown elsewhere the changing environ ments of the conquering and ever victorious Vedic Aryan tribes made them transfer their religious loyalty, which they had origi nally entertained for the World sovereign, Asura Varuna, to the national war god, Indra But, even after that, some ardent followers of the Varuna religion, like the Vasisthas, tried to preserve the primary greatness of Varuna&rsquo;s personality One of the methods adopted to secure this was to bring about a compro mise between the Varuna religion and the new Indra religion Varuna was consequently associated with Indra, more or less artificially, as his comrade in a common cause

If religious dignity and recognition had to be specially granted to any particular god, it was the practice of the Vedic poets to do so by associating that god with Indra and his fight with Vrtra That made the god, so to say, a legitimate' member of the Vedic pantheon This seems to bayc becn the purpose of the obviously loose and artificial connection of the Visnu-mythology with the Indra mythology
There are three distinct phases of the relation of Visnu with Indra, as seen in the Vedic hymos Firstly, Indra and Visnu are brought together as equal partners in a common glorious deed (IV 18 11; VIII 52 3), secondly, a clear attempt is made by the Vishu-glorifiers to place Visnu, in some cases (VIII 31 10). in a more emincnt position than Indra, by calling the latter, 11snoh sacabhinah; and, finally, Visnu is said to be the subordinate ally of Indra, deriving his power of taking three strides from the latter (VIII. 12 27), and is also represented (VII 15 9) as celebratiog the greatness of Indra All these phases indicate that there was no definite view point held by the Vedic poets regarding the mutual relationship between Indra and Visnu It was more or less in a fluid condition! It may be suggested in this connection that Visnu belonged to and was glorified by some circles outside the hicratic families of the Vedic poets The artificial bringing together of Visnu and Indra may then be said to be the result of the efforts made on the mythological plane to establish some kiod of under standing between the respective worshippers of these two gods This would explain the obvious awkwardness felt by the Vedic poets in this connection The followers of the Visnu rcligion wanted to invest their god with the necessary religious dignity by associat ing him with the officialnational god, Indra. Not only that, but they cyen tried to make Visnu supersede lodra It is of course not possible to accept the suggestion that the coalescence of the Visnu religion with the Indra-religion reflected that of the

Brāhmanas with the Ksatriyas? Two other more reasonable explanations of this phenomenon may be offered Either Visnu was a very important god of the indigenous tribes of India and was, therefore, not readily accepted by the Vedic Aryans at the time of the fusion of the two cultures Or&ndash;and this is surely more likely - Visau was a god of great eminence among the masses of the Aryan nomads themselves and was not parti cularly liked by the orthodox families of the Vedic poets, perhaps on account of some “revolting' traits in the primary nature of that god Anyway, the foregoing analytical examination of Vispu&rsquo;s association with lodra would give us the necessary start ing point for the discussion of the problem of Vişnu&rsquo;s true personality
The three strides of Visņu form a more ipherent feature of the Visru mythology What do these strides indicate? Yāska quotes in his Nirukia the views of his predecessors in this regard (XII 19)

WHITNEY, ROTH, MAX MULLER, and KAEGI who took the three steps of Visnu to mean the risiøg the culminating and the setting of the sun. The solar pature of Visnu is undoubtedly prominent in the Veda, since many other subsidiary features of Visnu&rsquo;s personality mentioned there clearly confirm it Vedic references to Visnu such as falarcas (VIT 100 3) sardrš (1 155. 5), vbhūladyumna (I 56 1 ), etc, definitely make him out to be a god of light and splendour 10 The common epithets of Vishu in the RV are urugaa wide stepping) esa or eva) aran (full of motion) dharmani dharayan, riasja garbha, redhah (upholding the ordinances), and pūryja aad nana (ancient and new) The sun god is observed to be traversing the whole atmosphere from borizon to horizon through his wide strides, he completes the whole extensive course just during one day, he never swerves from the path and never misses the time, he is an htc has been seen since times immemorial and at the same time, he is young because lie appears newly every morning Thus the four prominent characteristics suggested by the above mentioned epithets or Vinu-namely, vide steppiog, swift motion, regularity of course and new and ancient forms on the same day - are found together only in the sun god The solar nature of Visnu, in the Veda, is consequently beyond doubt In the Salapatha Brahmana (IV 11 10) we have been told that Visņu s head was cut off and it later became the sun But the most sure cvidence in this regard is the passage in the RV (1 155 6) where Vishu is celebrated as setting in motion, like a tevolving wheel, his minety steeds with four dames each This tclercncc talen in conjunction with certain stanzas in I 164 lealcs no doubt that the steeds represent the days and the pames represent the seasons It is thus the description of the sun god creating the solar car or 360 days It is further likely that Visau&rsquo;s

that the principal motif in the Vedic Visnu.mythology is the extent of space The references about Visnu such as, urugaya, uruksit, urusu vikramanesu, vigāman, etc, make it clear that Visnu was eminently a space god The emphasis is mainly put on Visnu&rsquo;s measuring the vast space Even in the

Against this theory put forth by that antı solar mythologist OLDENBERG, it must be first of all mentioned that the concep tion of the three strides. understood by him as indicating exclusi vely the vastness of space, is not warranted by the Vedic evidence Moreover, bis objection, namely that Visnu&rsquo;s characteristic three steps cannot refer to the sun&rsquo;s course, since what is said about them does not agree with morning, noon, and evening, is surely not valid The interpretation of the three steps of Visnu, men tioned by OLDENBERG in his objection, is certainly wrong, but the Vedic descriptions of the three steps clearly connect them, as will be shown later on, with a different and quite a distinctive activity of the sun Further, OLDENBERG seems to translate the word urugaya as &lsquo;the lord of wide spaces&rsquo;, and not as wide stepping', whuch latter would be the more correct render ing The emphasis put on the notion of wide space appears to have been based more particularly on 10cidental ritualistic referen ces thas on actual Vedic descriptions OLDENBERG and other scholars like GELDNER,18 for instance, who say that Visou is the

Though the predominantly solar nature of Visou is thus indicated by the Vedic evidence as a whole, it is not correct to identify his three strides with the rising, the culmination, and the setting of the sun, as ROTH. KAEGI, and MAX MULLER did, following Aurnavābha 24 The third step of Visnu, which is described as very sublime and as leading to the mysterious world of the highest heaven, shows no connection whatsoever with the sun set Not even the soaring winged birds venture to approach that third step of Visnu (I 155 5 ) 25 With it is connected the highest and the third place of Agai(I 72 2–4), that is, of the sun The gods enjoy themselves there (VIII 29 7), for, in the third step of Visnu there is a spring of honey (I 154 5) 28 Visnu&rsquo;s epithet, girih sit, as well as the reference to the many-horded cows (clouds ?) (I 154 6) moving at the highest step of Visnu are further indicative of its being in the highest heaven That step is also the abode of the pious devotecs (I 154 5-6, V 3 3) HOPKINS understands these pious devotees ( devayavah) to be the pious dead and seems to put special emphasis on this characteris tic of Vişnu&rsquo;s highest step Visou is, according to him, the first god to represent, what he continues to represent through later ages, the sun home of souls 27 This conception of the solar home of souls,28 which is too evidently connected with Visnu to be

casıly set aside as of no account, make two things quite clear: firstly, that in Visnu&rsquo;s personality solar nature is very prominent; and, sccondly, that his highest step is on the top of the sky and may not, therefore, be identified with the setting of the sun Other features of Visnu&rsquo;s three strides, such as that all the worlds subsist in them (I 154 2), that Visnu measured the whole url verse with them (1. 154 3), and that they commence on the tarth (1 22 16 ) and end in the bighest heaven (I 154 5 )- all go to prove that the naturalistic interpretation of the three strides, given by Aurnavābha and adopted by ROTH and others, is not at all warranted by the Vedic evidence They do not represent the daily course of the sun from horizon to horizon Through the Visnu mythology the Vedic poets have presented the picture of the sun as a swiftly moving lumipary which, with vast strides, traverses the whole universe in its thrce fold division of the earth, the atmosphere, and the heaven, which is so familiar to the Vedic cosmography This explanation originally suggested by Sakapūni and later on accepted by a majority of scholars satisfactorily meets all the requirements of the three steps as described in the RV It is again this explanation, which presalis in the later Vedic literature I&rsquo;S II 25, TS 1 7 5 4, ŚPBI 9 39, VI 7 4 7) The essen tial notion underlying the three steps of Visnu us thus the diurnal course of the sun in his ascent from the horizon of the earth, through the atmosphere, to the zenith, namely the solar paradise of the Vedic • Elysion' The reference to the three Visnu-steps to be taken by the sacrificer in the full moon and the neiy.moon sacrifices (TS I 7 6 1 ) is also clearly indicative of the three regions of the universe 29 It is not a solar deity in its general character that is represented through the Vedic Visnu, rather the

secondly, Visnu is described as taking the three strides for the deliverance of mankind in distress (VI 49 13) MACDONELL brings forth other traces of Vişou&rsquo;s general character as the
Preserver, in the Veda Visou 15 beneficent (I 156 5), 15 innocuous and bountiful (VII 25 12), and a generous protector (1155 4) But only such features of an ordinary sun god cannot adequately account for Visnu&rsquo;s sudden rise to prominence in Hindu mythology As pointed out elsewhere, Vişnu must have already been a great god among the &lsquo;extra-Vedic circles and his later eminence was merely a legitimately recognised come-back
Though there is no reference to Vāmana in the RV, the three strides of Visnu undoubtedly form the foundation of the paurānic vāmanāvatāra In the Brālimana literature (TS VI 2 4, SPB I 2 S, AB VI. 15) Visnu&rsquo;s dwarf-form is actually connected with his three steps by means of which he covers the whole Universe The faint traces of the later jarállatára of Visnu are to be found in the RV (1 61 7, VIII 77 10) and the later Vedic literature (TS VII 1,5 1, TB1 1 3 5, TAXI 8, SPB XIV 1 2 11 )
35 Vhat the primary action underlying Viçou s dwarf form is it is not casy to imagine A KUHN (Uber Entwicklungsstufen der Althenbrldung, 128) thinks that the dwarf represents the sun light which sbrinks into dwarf&rsquo;s size In die cycoing OLDEYBERC (Rd5&rdquo;, 233 ) suggests that the idea has evolved out of a fable about a wide stepping giant who could turn busell into a dwarf This is evidently far fetched According to LEITH (RPJU, 111), MACDOVELL (FRAS 1895, 176-77) and HILLEBRANDT (VM, N A , 139 ), Vitou assumes the dwarf form only by way of a stratagem 10 order to mislcad the Asuras An cthical interpretation of this aralara u given by MACNICOL

Whatever the real factors were which contributed towards the clevation of Visnu from a minor position which he occupied in the RV-mythology to be an important member of the Hindu Trinity of gods, it is evident that the faint traces of the beginning of this process are to be discovered even in the Brāhmana litera. ture Visnu is said to be the highest among the gods (ŚPB XIV 115), he is their door-keeper (ABI 30 19), the gods have their mouth in Visnu (TSI 7 5) Though Visnu has only few insignificant offerings made to him in the Vedic ritual, a stage was reached when he was actually identified with the sacrifice as a whole The AB(I 1) clearly states agnir jai derānām ayamah, visnuh paramah, tadantarena sarvā devatah It cannot, however, be said that Visnu lad attained his paurānic supremacy in the Brahmanas The process had only begun As the importance of Vişnu was gradually growing, that of Indra was correspondingly diminishing This position is finally consolidated 10 the Mahābhārata where we are told that Indra, in fear, hastens to Visou and that Visnu bestows upon him his power Visnu is there positively placed over and above Indra The Visnu-religion may thus be said to have overpowered the Vedic Indra-religion
It would be greatly helpful to see what light the etymology of the name Visnu throws on the wliole Visnu-problem The most common way of explaining the game is to derive it from the root vis,' to be active 97 The very quick and active movements of the sun god are suggested through this explanation But it is not made clear what suffix is added and how the word is gramma tically formed 38 BLOOMFIELD may be said to have made a distinct contribution to the Visnu problem by proposing that the name was made up of two parts, ( = through) and snu or sānu

It is also not unlikely that the name itself primarily indicaetd a bird We shall, therefore, be justified in presuming that the bud form is the earliest known feature of the personality of Visou In the early Veda, Visnu is clearly represented as the sun bird, though it is not pecessary to assume that this conception was the primary one to many ancient mythologies the sun is seen to have been represented as a bird 4 In some cases the sun is also represented as the &lsquo;flying horse&rsquo;, some faint traces of which may be available even in the descriptions of Vişnu 15 Very early in the evolution of religious thought people imagined of a divide being overrunning the three regions of the universe with the greatest possible speed Such a being could only be a bird, which is popularly supposed to be the quickest among the creatures Like many other peoples of antiquity, the Indians also represented the sun under the form of a bird which flies swiftly through the sky

VISNU IN THE VEDA
I have so far sought to show that the Vedic hymns Tepresent Visnu mainly as a solar deity in the form of a bird, and that the ascent and the descent of the sun through the three regions are glorified through Visnu&rsquo;s three strides which form the outstanding feature of his mythology in the Veda These conclusions, however, cannot be said to have finally solved the basic problems regarding Visnu Firstly, if Visnu was merely an ordinary sun-god, why should there have been the obvious hesitation on the part of the Vedic poets in legitimately admittiog him to the pantheon of the Vedic gods? What otherwise is the significance of associating Visnu with Indra, and that too in such a superficial and artificial manner 1 Secondly, why should a Vedic sun-god alone be chosen for the supreme position in the Hindu mythology? And why particularly Visnu from among the several solar diyioities? These questions would ultimately lead us to the hypothesis that, besides his solar nature, there was another more essential aspect of Visnu&rsquo;s personality and that an attempt was made by the Vedic poets and priests to suppress it purposely As, however, the case is, there have survived some up mistakable traces of that aspect of Visnu&rsquo;s personality in the Vedic hymns and ritual
The most significant word in this connection is Šipivista, which is exclusively employed in the Veda with reference to Visnu The passages where the word occurs in the RV (VII 99 7, 100 5-7) scem to have been kept obscure with a purpose The Vedic poets evidently sought to make a guarded and a casual reference to that aspect of Visnu&rsquo;s personality which was indicated by the word ßipuvista Many attempts lave been made to explain that word, but few satisfy the requirements of philology47 and DONC brings out the true nature of Visnu It is not possible

to separate philologically the word sepa ( = penis) from šipi Other simular IE forms are sıpha (=a root), pkt chepa, lat cippus, scipio ( staff), etc Even Nirukta (V 7) seems to be vaguely supporting this view though its further explanation 15 not clear 48 Added to that word is a form from the root vs, thus making the whole word mean the changing phallus, the swelling and diminishing penis ' 49 We may now easily understand why the Vedic poets speak in such guarded and obscure way about this form of Visnu It is also very signi ficant that Aupamanyava (Nirukia, V 7) says of this name of Visnu kursitārthiyam pun am bhavaht The word sipasta has thus unmistakably preserved Vişnu&rsquo;s ancient phallic nature. There are also many other incidental references to Visnu in the Vedic hymns and ritual, which clearly associate him with the notions of fertility, productivity, and sex-life
One of the obscure features of the Vedic śrāddha ritual is that the angustha, without nail, is to be dipped into the offering intend ed for the Pitrs This action is accompanied by an invocation to Visnu The angustha is undoubtedly a symbol of the phallus Visnu is, in this rite, clearly connected with the phallıc aspect of the Vedic ritual 50 In the TS passage (VI 2 4 2), jajno deiebhyo nila, ata risnurupam krna sa prthn im prāvasat, we find another piece of evidence in this regard Visnu&rsquo;s entering into the mother

earth is a symbolical description of a fertility-rite The words, tanvī irdhanah, used with reference to Visnu (VII 99 i, also cf. VIII 100 2) may further be understood to be indicative of his phallic nature Visnu is significantly identified, in later literature, with Hiranyagarbha and Nārāyana si Visgu&rsquo;s close connection with Sidivāli (AV VII 46 3), the broad hipped' divinity protect ing the feminine sex functions, throws considerable light on thus aspect of Visnu&rsquo;s personality According to the sänhhayana Grhyasūtra (I 22 13), the RV-mantra, visnur yonim halpazatu (X 184 1 ), accompanies the garbha ceremony, thus suggesting that Visou is the efficacious protector of the embryos 52 In the AV (VII 17 4), Visnu is significantly connccted with praja. The two epithets of Visnu, nisiktapă (VII 36 9) protector of the semen &lsquo;, and sumajjani (I 156 2) &lsquo;facilitating easy birth&rsquo;(?) speak for themselves The word, paumsja manly vigour&rsquo; is significantly used with reference to Visnu in the RV (I 155 3-4). The vrsākapı-hymn in the RV (X 86 ) has aroused serious contro versy regarding its interpretation Without going loto the details of that controversy, one may say that, broadly speaking, that hymn describes how, when Indra felt greatly exhausted, a bold, lascivious monkey administered to him some medicine, and how, as a result of it, Indra regained his manly power This Yrsäkapı is identified, in later literature, with Visnu, the word beiag also mentioned as one of his pames in the Visnusahasra namastotra 53 There is thus abundant indirect evidence provided by the Vedic hymns and ritual to proye Vasnu&rsquo;s connection with fertility and productivity rites 5: As elsewhere, so also in India,
51 Narayana is philologically connected with #onra (= manly vigour).

popular customs and conceptions of the religion of the masses have paturally been the primary foundations of great Brahmapical sacrifices The god of fertility and productivity occupied a very prominent place in the religion of the common people The Aryans particularly, who had been mainly agriculturists must have glorified the vegetation divinity and vegetation-rites to a very great extent For instance, in the Mahārata, which was clearly a vegetation ritual, the main features of generative nites and vegeta tion rites are quite transparent Through a very penetrating study of the Nahāvrata, from this point of view, JOHANSSON has proved that a conspicuous part was played in that ritual by a vegetation divinity 10 bird form 55 According to MANNHARDT (Wald und Feldk I) and FRAZER (The Golden Bough), the fertility fetish in many primitive vegetation rites was a bird Thus bird-motif is seen also in the bird form of the mahadukihy a-vedi in the Malāvrata A possibility is hereby suggested that it was Visnu, as a bird, who was the most prominent figure in all such rites The original nature of Visnu as a bird has already been indicated Visnu was, therefore, primarily the fertility bird All this explains how Visnu, as a god of fertility, must have occupied a prominent position in the primitive Aryan religious thought and ritual Other so called obscure references to Visnu, such as šipivista, agree perfectly well with this aspect of Visnu&rsquo;s personality
A well reasoned account may thus be offered of the evolution of the whole Visnu-religion Visnu must have been regarded as a bird, at least among certain culture groups among the Vedic people in that form he was very closely connected with the vegetation ritual He was, indeed, the god of fertility and productivity and as such he must have been regarded as most eminent in the popular religion of the masses It was, however, on account of the aversion, on the part of the Vedic priestly intellectuals and the conquering higher classes, for this popular fertility god and his upcouth, frivolous, and to a certaia extent

obscene fertility rituals, that Visnu was not easily admitted to the pantbeon of the Vedic gods. The Vedic poets could not, how ever, completely ignore him. They, therefote, sought to trans form the basic character of Visou. This attempt of theirs was greatly facilitated by the original bird-form of that god. The hieratic Vedic poets understood the bird-form of Visnu as indi cating not the fertility-god but the sun-god. They thus tried to suppress, as far as possible, the true nature of this god of the people'. But those culture-groups 56 among whom Yısau was a prominent god must have persisted in forciog him upon the
official” Yedic religion which was dominated by the Indra mythology. From the point of view of the official' Vedic religion, the popular god Visnu was, so to say, hierarchised by being artificially and deliberately brought into association with Indra who, as it were, served as the philosopher&rsquo;s stone for such purpose. This accounts for the obvious fluctuations in the artificial and superficial relationship between Visnı and Indra. It is not necessary to assume non-Aryan influence in this regard 57 It was merely a matter between the classes' and the masses&rdquo; among the Vedic people themselves.58 la post-Vedic times when the popular religion again came into prominence, Visou became the supreme god. He had by then inherited several features from the many earlier aspects of his personality. As KEITH has poin ted out,9 Krsoa himself was originally the spirit of reviving vegetation.

<p>Vedic gods often seem to possess very complex characters The descriptions in the Vedic hymas usually bring forth so many different traits of a single god that it is not always easy to deter mine the original nature and trace the later development of his personality In this respect Pusao may be regarded as being a particularly curious and enigmatic figure in the pantheon of Vedic gods This god is celebrated alone in ciglit hymns of the Rgveda, with Indra in one hymn, with Soma in one, and is mentioned with several other deities in about fifty eight hymns, his name thus being mentioned about 120 times He is also glorified in the Atharvaveda and the Bralimanas, and seems to have played a distinctive role in the Vedic ritual The picture of Pusan derived from all these manifold literary and ritual references is, indeed, puzzlingly composite
Even a casual glance at the statistical analysis of the RV references to Pusan' will suffice to bring out prominently a peculiar feature of the way in which this god has been celebrated in that Veda Out of the eight complete hymns glorifying Pusan, five occur in the sixth mandala of the RV which primarily reflects the literary and religious activities of the clan of the Bhāradvājas That portion of the sixth mandala (hymns 53-58, hymn 48 15-19), which is dedicated exclusively to Pusan, is so conspicuous that HILLEBRANDT chooses to call it a small Pusan-sambitā&rsquo;in itself 2 This fact cannot be regarded as just an accident On the contrary it seems to indicate that the Pusan cult was a special possession of the family of the Bhāradvājas No discussion regarding the essential character of Pusan can be said to be complete and conclusive, unless the real significance of this impor

tant feature of the Puşan religion in the RV is clearly explained Equally significant is the fact that the Panis are most prominently mentioned in the sixth mandala and that Pusan is the god who is specially invoked to put down those nasty mischief mongers of the Vedic times Another point that would strike a student of Vedic mythology is that Pusan is coupled rather predominantly only with two gods from the Vedic panicon, namely, Indra (VI 57) and Soma (II 40) A critical study of the passages referring to Indrā pusanau (11152 7, VI 57) leads one to the conclusion that originally the Indra religion and the Pusan religion were in independent religious cults and that a special effort was made to bring them together similar appears to have been the case also with regard to the coupling together of Soma and Puşan The traces of this artificial blendıog together of two distinct religious cults are too clear in the RV to be missed The anthropomorphic traits in the descriptions of Pusan are also noteworthy Vedic re ferences to Pusan&rsquo;s braided hair (VI 55 2 ) and beard (X 26 7), to his awl (VI 53 6 ) and goad (YI 53 9), to his special food, karambha (VI 56 1), to his car being driven by goats instead of horses (I 138 4, VI 55 3, 4, 57 3)- all these present before us quite a distinctive personality, that is to say, the personality of a god belonging to a world more or less different from that of many Vedic gods as we know them But by far the greatest emphasis is laid by the Vedic poets on the prominent role played by Pusan in the pastoral life of the people Indeed, Pusan is the only Vedic god who has been given the epithet pašupā, protector of the cattle (VI 58 2) durectly (and not in comparisons) He increases the cattle (VI 53 10, 54 5-6, 56 5) and brings back those that have strayed (VI 54 7, 10) He eats the food which is common among the pastoral communities (VI 56 1 ) and bears the goad (VL 53 9 ) which is typical of a shepherd as a cowherd
It is said of him that he commands large amounts of wealth (1 89 6, VIII 4 15) and bestows great bounty (VI 584) On his worshippers, particularly in the form of the increase of cattle
Another characteristic feature of Pusan&rsquo;s personality is his close association with paths. He is the lord of paths and helps
PŪSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD
93
the nomadic tribes on their ways (X 17 3-6) As has been pointed out, Pusan knows the paths, shows the paths, leads on the right paths, and guards the people and cattle against missing the ways 3
Apart from all this, as is quite common with Vedic mythology in general, Pusan also is endowed with features connected with brightness and splendour He is brought into contact with several phenomena of light (VI 48 17, 56 3, 58 I) Expressions are used with reference to Pusan which are similar to those which are used with reference to Agnis and Surya 5 The part which he is made to play in the Suryā myth (X 85 26 ) is, indeed, very peculiar
This brief statement would give the impression that Pusan was a god of intrinsically complex personality, characterised as it is by apparently inconsistent and unconnected traits So far scholars have either cmphasised only one sjogle aspect of this god&rsquo;s personality by making him the sun god, or the god of paths,e etc, thereby almost overlooking his other traits which do not fit in with their respective theories, or, otherwise, they have tried to strike a compromise by making him represent, from the very beginning an inherently mixed conception such as that of the beneficent power of the sun manifested chiefly as a pastoral deity” As a matter of fact, we have to approach such problems

of Vedic mythology from the point of view of what may be called
evolutionary mythology' It ought to be realised that the nature of the Vedic gods had been changing with the vicissitudes in the Vedic life And corresponding to the different stages in the course of this evolution different traits came to be added to the essential character of the Vedic gods Their original nature was modified, their relations among themselves were altered, their worshippers also did not necessarily remain always the same As the result of all this the final picture became complex and full of apparent inconsistencies Keeping in mind this important feature of Vedic mythology let us attempt a fresh approach to the Pusan problem Let us see if it is possible to present the whole evolu tion of the personality of Pusan in such a manner that all the apparently inconsistent and unconnected details of his nature referred to in the Vedic texts and indicated by Vedic religious practices are shown to be logically and historically connected and consistent It has to be remembered that the Pusan mythology had passed through all the stages of its development even before the RV Samhita was finally formulated A critical analysis of the textual references and ritual indications mentioned above: followed by a constructive synthesis will however, help us to distinguish those stages markedly from one another 10
Let us begin by examining the earlier theories regarding Pusan&rsquo;s essential character The most common view is to regard Pusan as a solar divinity This has been the opinion of the Indian scholiasts themselves Yāska, for instance, regards Pusan as a celestial divinity (dyusthana devata) and emphasises his solar character by pointing out that Pusan is the sun god who bears an abundance of rays 11 The same view has been developed by the Brhaddevata (2 63 ) which describes Pusan as the sun god who helped (from pus) the earth by dispelling the darkness by means of his rays A majority of early Vedists have paturally followed

the lead given by these Indian cxcgctical texts 1? The solar theory is mainly based on certain epithets of Pusan, which are sugges tive of light and splendour As a matter of fact, however, out of the scicral cpithets attributed to Pusan, only one, namely, aghrni (VI 48 16, 53 3,55 1,3), may be said to be suggestive of the sun god Indeed, BLOOMFIELD claims for this god a clearly solar character on the strength of that very ancient epithet, aghrni (glowing, being specifically used with reference to him 13 But it will be seen that this cpithet is quite general in sense and may be made to indicate any resplendent divinity For example it is used with reference to Agni also (VIII 60 20) This single epithet cannot, therefore, bc regarded as a decisive proof regarding Pusan&rsquo;s fundamental character ! If this epithet had been really characteristic of Pusan, why should it have been dropped out in later literature? The very fact that it disappears completely in later times would suggest that it was only superficially attributed to Pusan Further, the bright aspect of Pusan&rsquo;s personality which is referred to in some stray cases (VI 48 17, 58 1) may be regarded as being indicative merely of the light symbolism, which is commonly superimposed by Vedic poets on their gods Bright ness and splendour are considered to be thic external manifestations of divine power Puson&rsquo;s part in the Suryi myth has also been put forth as strongly supporting the solar theory But that whole myth is so puzzling that, by itself, it does not offer any substantial

clue to solve the Pusan problem That myth points rather to Pusan&rsquo;s having been included in it by way of an afterthought PERRY rightly suggests that this myth must be the result of the meeting of two different streams of legend, in one of which Pusan and in the other Surya plays the chief role It is also possible to explain the references to the mysterious relationships and to the motif of incest occurring in that myth on the assumption that certain elements of the original Pusan cult were integrated into that myth which was based on solar and light phenomena 18
Another piece of evidence produced by HILLEBRANDT? and PERRY18 jn support of the solar theory is the fact that Pusad is coupled with Soma both in the RV-Samhita (II 40 ) and in Vedic ritual 19 They argue that Soma represents the moon god and so Pusan must necessarily represent the sun god The very starting point of this seasoning is unconvincing The original nature of Soma was not lunar It will be shown later that this coupling together of Pusan and Soma is significant from quite a different point of view and forms an important stage in the evolution of the Pusan-religion In II 40, a reference is made to Pusan&rsquo;s dwelling in heaven as well as to his wandering between the heaven and the earth ( also X 17 6) This is taken to indicate the sun&rsquo;s daily journey from and back to heaven The fact that Pusan leads the dead from the earth to the other world (X 17 3 ) is also inter preted as supporting the above assumption 20 According to BLOOMFIELD, such references are typical of the familiar notion of the Vedic poets that the sun oversees everything 11 A critical examination of the Vedic passages cited above would, however, show that they are very casual references and do not at all point

Ir the essential function of Pusap The close association of Pusan with Ago (1 122 5, II 1 6, X 17 3 ) also cannot be said to be suggestive of Pusan&rsquo;s solar nature
The &lsquo;increasc facilitating&rsquo; faculty, which is prominent in Pusad s character, is again not exclusively solar On the other hand, assuming that the word, pūsan, really means Prospero' (cf BLOOMFIELD, The Religion of the Vedas, 170), it may reaso nably be asked why the sun god, alone among the Vedic gods, should be glorified with that title Parjanya and Maruts also are represented as conferring prosperity on mankind Therefore, Pusan&rsquo;s increase facilitating faculty cannot by itself be a proof of his solar character It should also be noted that the prosperity conferred by Pusan is obviously connected with cattle, this fact cannot be satisfactorily reconciled with that god&rsquo;s solar nature The sun&rsquo;s power of 10creasing cattle is evidently not direct and natural ?! In one of the myths (VI 56 3 ) Pusan is described as loading the suns wheel on some hairy speckled animal Eise where (VI 55 2,56 2) hc is called a chariotcer par excellence
These references are said to be indicative of Pusan&rsquo;s solar aspect, particularly as a solar charioteer But docs that not mean that Puşan is here markedly distinguished from the sun god? There are several other passages where this distinction between the sun and Pusan is clearly brought out Pusan is called the messenger of the sun (VI 58 3 ) and is elsewhere mentioned as being different from the sun (e &amp; VI 48 17): Further, it cannot be argued, on the strength of Pusans association with Savitr (V 81 5, X 139 1 ) and of the fact that the epithet agonya is peculiar to Savitr (1 110 3, IV 33 7) and Pusan (X 64 3)), that Pusan

The various Vedic passages referred to above cannot, there fore, be said to indicate the essential solar nature of Pūsan Many other objections may be raised against the solar theory Certain epithets like ajāśva and karambhäd, which are exclusively attri buted to Pusan,28 do not even distantly hint at his solar character Further the anthropomorphic traits of Pūsan, mentioned in the RV, though scanty, are sufficiently individualistic The braided hair and beard are hardly suggestive of the sun-god 27 The peculiarities with regard to Pusan&rsquo;s food (VI 56 1), weapon (VI 53 5), car (VI 54 3 ) and the animal driving it (I 138 4; VI 55 3,4), as also his other mannerisms, are so life like and realistic that they completely banish out of account any possibility of a naturalistic interpretation of his personality 29 It is also difficult to explain satisfactorily, on the basis of the solar theory, the peculiar relation that seems to have existed between the Pusan-religion and the clan of the Bhāradvājas it may further be asked if Pusan was originally the sun god, what exactly could be the significance of his being coupled with Indra and Soma only and that too by way of an afterthought? What, again, is the special significance of the sun god alone being invoked to pupish the Panis? In the hymn, VIII 29, where the distinctive features of several Vedic gods are mentioned in the form of riddles, the

solar aspect of Paşan is not even hinted at ( VIII. 29.6). Taking into account the special characteristics of the Vedic Pisan one does not feel inclined to accept the conclusion arrived at by ATKINS, who has made a fresh study of the Pūşan-problem od the basis of all the available material on the subject, namely, that, when considered in the aggregate the Vedic references lead us to the assumption that Puşan was primarily a sun-god. 9 As a matter of fact, the emphasis put by the Vedic poets on the traits of Puşan&rsquo;s personality other than those connected with light and splendour is so conspicuous that even the supporters of the solar theory tend towards modifying their theory in various ways. Püşan is made to represent the sun god in different positions and capacities. But this, in itself, may be regarded as an indication of the inherently untenable character of that theory. Such variations of the solar theory no doubt exhibit considerable ingenuity on the part of their authors; but on critical examination they are found to be quite unconvincing.

It is said in support of the solar theory that Püsan was origi nally the sun god, but when his nature as a god of paths or a pastoral god came to be prominently emphasised in later Vedic times, the solar aspect in his personality became indistinct and vague This explanation, however, is not convincing It may be pointed out that the sun&rsquo;s connexion with paths and pastoral life is not so very intrinsic that it should become the basis of the future prominent development of his character Why should the sun god alone be brought into such an organic relation with pastoral religion ? Many other Vedic gods seem to play an equally – if not more - important role in pastoral life Morcover, It may be asked If this pastoral aspect is a later development of the basic solar character of Pusan, why has it ultimately dis appeared ? In later times we find that the traces of the bucolic aspect are quite indistinct As a matter of fact, those traits in Pusan&rsquo;s personality, which are supposed to have been the result of a later development, must be reasonably expected to be conspi cuously preserved That is, however, not the case
It cannot be denied that the Vedic poets have made an obvious attempt to endow Pusan&rsquo;s personality with some features connec ted with light and splendour But the above discussion leads one to the following conclusions Firstly, there is no clear evidence to show ibat Pusan represents a phenomenon of nature to Secondly, Pusan cannot at all be said to have originally represented a solar divinity In fact the light symbolism which is perceptible from the Vedic references to Pusan does not form an intrinsic and

essential aspect of that god&rsquo;s nature It is too flat, commonplace, and colourless for that Therefore, one may be justified in concluding further that the phenomena of light with which Pusan is associated in the Veda were introduced by way of an after thought and perhaps with some special purpose in view
It has already been noticed that the traits in the Pusan mytho logy connected with light and splendour are so ambiguous that they have given rise to doubts as to whether the bright aspect of Pusan&rsquo;s personality indicates his solar nature or the lunar nature or the stellar nature SIECKE believes that Pusan was origipally
a moon divinity who later assumed the functions of a god of paths 43 HERTEL also seems to support this view 41 From the point of view of comparative mythology SIECKE assumes that the Similarity of Pusan with Hermes is undoubted 45 Accordiagly he regards both of them as moon gods As will be pointed out in the sequel, there are, indeed, certain characteristics in Pusan&rsquo;s nature which appear to be unmistakably indicating bis lunar aspect It is also easily intelligible that the moon, and not so much the sun, should be brought into close contact with the lord ship of paths But to say that Pusan represents essentially and originally the moon god is quite unconvincing 46 On that assum
ption it would be difficult to explain why a moon god should be invested with the peculiar features which characterise the Pusan mythology As a matter of fact, all that has been said above against the solar theory may with equal cogency apply to other

theories seeking to make Pusan represent one or the other pheno menon of Light
GHOSH starts with the assumption that the physical nature of a large number of RV deities can be interpreted from the astro pomical and meteorological poiots of view On the basis of the obscure Suryā myth, he believes that Pusan appears in the heaven at night towards morning with Asvins, and goes away before sunrise He consequently identifies Pusan with the constellation Auriga of the northern hemisphere 47 Apart from the highly questionable Oature of the Süryā myth, it will be seen that GHOSH has altogether neglected other more prominent features of Pusan&rsquo;s character 49 The same may be said to be the case with GHOSE, who makes Pusan a god of Light and Moisture-the two principles sustaining the universe 49 No attention seems to have been paid here either to Pusan&rsquo;s antbropomorphic traits, or to his peculiar connection with paths and pastoral life in general Even a casual study of the Pusan samlità in the sixth mandala would suffice to show how untenable such theories are on the very face of them! There were periods in the history of Vedic mythological studics when the Vedic gods were exclusively made to represent either some natural phenomena - particularly connected with heaven and light -or some ritualistic conceptions Naturalistic and ritualistic traits are superimposed upon the original Vedic mythology in many cases &ldquo;But a critical study of the Vedic mythology soon makes it clear that these traits cannot have constituted the intrinsic nature of the gods ja question A reference has already been made to BERGAIGNE&rsquo;s view That scholar even goes to the extent of ultimately identifying Pusan with Soma 50 Neither Vedic texts nor Vedic ritualistic practices seem to substantiate this view it need hardly be added that many objections raised above against

the solar theory are applicable with equal force even in this connection
While dismissing the solar theory and the lunar theory51 as perfectly unsatisfactory, OLDENBERG emphasises yet another single aspect of Pusan&rsquo;s character thereby ignoring the other ones 5&rsquo; Pusan is seen to be active in several distinct capacities, But, according to OLDENBERG, the most characteristic function of this god is in connection with paths. He knows the paths and leads others safely on them (VI. 49.8). He guards men and cattle from going astray (VI. 54. 5-7). Those who are lost he brings back intact (I. 23. 13) Indeed, he knows where and how to find the lost things (I. 23 14; VI, 48, 15) OLDENBERG argues that the fundamental nature of a god&rsquo;s being is to be determined primarily on the basis of his post original and most essential function. Pūsan is, therefore, a lord of paths, regarded as a distinct dividity by the Vedic poets and celebrated by them as such. According to OLDENBERG, Pūsan is connected with agriculture only so far as he sees that the furrows of the plough are in the right direction (IV, 57. 7). Hts connection with cattle also is restricted to his leading them on the right path. Püsan&rsquo;s astrā is called pašusādhani (VI 53.9) OLDENBERG understands the word pašusādhani in the sense of leading the pasu on the right path' 5* The later development of this essential function of Pusan is to be seen in his being regarded as leading the bride, in a proper manner, from the father&rsquo;s to the husband&rsquo;s house
51. It 19 interesting to recall that OLDENBERG is usually in favour of the theory that the mood played a very prominent part in mythology It may also be noted that he identifies Varuna with the moon on the strength of a compara. tive study of Vedic and Semitic mythologies. Stecke too has referred to Semutic mythology in support of his theory that Pusan represents the moon god. But OLDENBERG finds SLECKE&rsquo;s argumentation unconvincing. He also rejects V. HENRY&rsquo;s vicw that AV VII 9 1 positively cstablishes Puşan&rsquo;s solar nature (Opal, 236, f n 4)
52 OLDENBERO, RAV, 234-37,
53 As against BERGAIONE who interprets pasusudhani as &lsquo;procurog cattle (O 68, 424). OLDENBERG believes that the verb sudh is distinctive of Paşan (VI 56 4-5, X. 26.4) and that it is appropriately connected with the god of patbs nncc sudhu as the standing epithet of path (Op. al, 234, f. n. !).
PÜSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD
105
(X 85 26) Püsan is also described as leading the dead to the other world (X 17 3) Himself the lord of paths, Pusan is born on the way (X 17 6) OLDENBERG interprets Pusan&rsquo;s epithet, vimuco napas, 10 two seases first, as the lord of lodging&rsquo;?), and, secondly, as the deliverer par excellence' Both these concep tions are, according to him, promloent 10 Pusan s nature as the lord of paths Other features of the Pusan mythology, such as his being the messenger of the sun (VI 58 3 ) and his finding out Soma as well as Agnt, when they were lost (I 23 14, X 55), are also explained by OLDENBERG as supporting his theory Fur ther the connection of the lord of paths with the goat is quite natural because the goat is certainly the most sure footed animal In some Vedic passages ( 1 42, VI 534) Pusan is described as cleaning the paths of evil spirits, wolf, and highway robbers It is significant that in Šānh GS II 14 9 he is represented as receiving offerings, in his capacity of the path finder, every morning and evening, on the threshold of the house So far as comparative mythology is concerned, OLDENBERG is of the opinion that Pusan 13 identical with Hermest and regards both of them as basically lords of paths That scholar even includes Pusan and Hermes, in this their original character, among such divinities as can be traced back to indogermanic antiquity
So far as OLDENBERG asserts that Pusan cannot be the personification of any nature phenomenon it is easy to accept his View But his theory that Pūsan&rsquo;s nature as a path finder or a lord of paths is the basic conception underlying that god&rsquo;s perso nality cannot possibly be accepted without challenge The very conception of a god of paths is so general that it is, indeed, dificult to imaginc that such a god could have ever been invested with distinct anthropomorphic traits Pusan is represented in the Veda with a distinct individuality Why should god of paths be speciücally characterised as a haramblad?

VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
(VI 53 5,9) are, again, not particularly pertinent in OLDEN. BERG&rsquo;s theory OLDENBERG seems to set aside completely the conspicuous bucolic pature of Pusan&rsquo;s personality and to put an Over-emphasis only on one of its features A god of paths cannot be regarded to be intrinsically connected with the prosperity of cattle 56 It may further be asked Had Pusan been originally a lord of paths is it not natural to expect that his seat should have been on the earth rather than in the heaven? The Pusan-religion on the whole gives the impression that it was a special religious cult belonging to a particular Vedic tribe The attempts at associating that religion artificially with the Indra religion and the Soma. ritual, which are evident in the Veda, also seem to support this Impression Can one believe that a god of paths was made ibe central figure in an ipdependent religious cult? The name, Pusan, also cannot be regarded as being particularly appropriate for a lord of paths It may be specifically emphasised that it is not correct to determine the pature of a god only from one or another characteristic feature of his It will, however, be clear from the above discussion that it is exactly what OLDENBERG has done As a matter of fact, it is not necessary to make Pusan an indepen. dent god of paths This feature represents only a part of the essential function of Pusan and may not, therefore, be distin gutshed from it
The common factor in the majority of the theories regarding Pusan&rsquo;s original nature referred to above may as well be taken to be a reasonable starting point for a correct approach to this problem in the various attempts suitably to modify then original theories scholars seem to agree in making a pointed reference to the obvious bucolic traits wbich characterise that god The sustained impression, which the Vedic passages refer ring to Pusap in general and the Pusan samhită in the stall mandala in particular produce, is that Pusan must have beca primarily and essentially a pastoral god He supervises the cattit and is responsible for the preservation and increase of herds

and flocks (VI 54 5-7) He is often referred to as a cattle giying god (cf VI 53 10 ) It is, indeed notcworthy that Pusan is concerned only with the prosperity of sheep and cattle The pastoral communities are represented in the Veda to bave been nomadic Naturally, they often emphasised one aspect of their special god, Pusan, namely, his lordship over the paths He leads his followers safely from one pasture to another He is celebrated as the knower of treasures (VIII 29 6), indicating thereby that he knows the right place where his pastoral followers should be taken In other words, he secures for them rich pasture lands But, at the same time, he is conscious of his other responsibility to his worshippers on the way he guards them În another passage (VI 56 5), Pusan is invoked to direct this cattle desiring band of ours' to the attainment of its desired objects 58 Maoy were the occasions when the cattle went astray and were lost Under such circumstances, the pastoral worshippers often appealed to their god who readily recovered the lost property (VI 54 10 ) Pusan is predominantly characterised as anastapasu (X 17 3), anastavedas (VI 54 8), and pašupa (VI 58 257 Among the pastoral tribes there is a special class of people who distinguish themselves in the art of path finding and tracing the lost sheep and cattle 58 It is this peculiar faculty of an actually existing class among the shepherds and cowherds that is idealised 10 Pusan by his worshippers (VI 54 1) It is a very common feature of any mythology that several characteristics of a god are often derived from the way of living of that god&rsquo;s worshippers
The god of the warlıke tribes is often represented as a warrior god The anthropomorphic traits of a god in particular may be regarded as being very suggestive in this connection It is easy to imagine that the pastoral tribes made their god look impressive
56 The logical and natural extension of this invocation is that Püsan should allot to his worshippers their share of mandens (IX. 67 10)

with braided hair (VI 55 2 159 and graceful beard The weapons that he wields are those which are usually employed by his pasto ral worshippers, the only difference being that the goad (VI 539) and the awl (VI 53 5) of Pusan possess some divine power The astră of Pusan was pašusādhani, that is to say, it helped his worshippers to acquire, preserve, and increase the cattle, and the āra cane in handy when he wanted to punish vitally the pasty mischief mongers, Panis, who harassed the pastoral communities in the course of their forward march to pastures new' (VI 53 5) It is also very suggestive, in this context, that Pusan&rsquo;s goad is described as go opasă ( VI 53 9), &ldquo;haying its head or top adorned with the figure of a bull” This word, which, inciden tally, occurs only once in the RV (and whose meaning is accor dingly uncertain ), is also interpreted as &ldquo;provided with a thong made of cattle skin&rdquo; Anyway, it would seem to confirm the essentially pastoral character of Pusan The significance of Pusan&rsquo;s peculiar connection with the goat (I 138 4, VI 55 3,4, 57 3, X 26 8) will be easily realised when we take into consideration the fact that the goat is the most surc footed animal and can traverse the most difficult paths Another very remarka ble example of how the distinctive features of a people are trans ferred to their god is to be found in the Vedic reference where Pusan is said to be weaving the raiment of sheep, and also make ing their raiment clean'
vasovaya &lsquo;yinām ā vasumsi marmriat (X 26 6) This passage can hardly be considered to be apropos unless we assume that Pusan is essentially a god of shepherds Further, it is interesting to note that the god of the shepherds and cowherds eats the simple food which they themselves must be eating, namely, karambha (VI 561) Particularly striking is the fact

that these pastoral worshippers are not ashamed of their god being a karambhad On the other hand, they put forth a challenge that he&rsquo;who aims at Pusan malignantly saying that he is merely a karambhad can never strike at him successfully&rsquo;
ja enam ādidešati karambhād iti pūsanam

An etymological study of the pame Pusan would also seem am nly to support the basic pastoral character of this god The word pūsan is usually derived from the root, pus, to increase, nourish, bestow bounty 61 This is, however, not satisfactory With that etymology it is not possible to explain why there should be a long pū in pisan 62 An attempt is made by BERGAIGNE63 to

Other characteristic features of the Pūsan mythology fit in well with this conception of that god&rsquo;s essential personality and primary funcions From the Vedic references it clearly appears that the clan of the Bharadvājas was specially devoted to the Pusan cult The Bhāradvājas must have been one of the ancient tribes whose main occupation was cattle-breeding And Pusad was the patron god of these nomadic shepherds and cowherds The living Pusan cult can very well be realised only from the Pusan samhita of the Bhāradvājas The fact that the Panis too

are most conspicuously mentioned in the sixth mandala tends to support the above assumption regarding the Bhāradvājas It is quite certain that the word panı does not have a merely appellative sense The Panis represent a distinct community possessing a religious cult different from the official Vedic religion They always wandered with the Vedic cattle breeding tribes and often used to harass them References to their riches and thefts are quite common in the Veda The Panis were notorious cattle lifters and, therefore, particularly antagonistic to the clan of the Bhāradvājas Thus there was, in the early Vedic times, a con tinuous conflict going on between the Bbāradvājas and the Pants; and the former often invoked their patron god, Pusan, to puoish these mischievous cattie lifters 88 Naturalk, for the Bharad vājas, Püsan was more important than any other god from among the Vedic pantheon The ten gayatrı stanzas of VI 53 seem to have formed some sort of magic formulae belonging to the Pusan cult, which were directed against the Panis, perhaps accompanied by some magic practices It may, therefore, be concluded that the pastoral clan of the Bharadvājas developed the essential persona. lity of Pisan in a distinctive manner 89
Pūsan&rsquo;s essentially pastoral personality thus represents the first stage in the evolution of the Pūsan mythology It is a common characteristic of the Vedic mythology in general that all gods are at some stage connected with heaven and light

This light symbolism is superimposed upon the original character of the Vedic gods and 15 therefore often casily distinguishable from it It gives an unmistakable impression of artificiality and superficiality This current of thought is clearly perccptible even in the case of an essentially pastoral god like Puşan It has already been indicated that the light symbolism in Puşan s pature is distinctly colourless and superficial It is also so vague and ambiguous that it is not easy to determine whether, in this second stage, Puşan was regarded as a sun god or as a moon god A critical examination of such Vedic passages as are suggestivc of light and splendour, however, Icads onc to bclicic that Pusan was regarded as a moon god rather than a sun god It should first of all, be remembered that Pusan is often cicarly distinguished from the sun (VI 56 3) Then there is a passage ( VI 38 3) where Puşan 15 described as the messenger of the sur Plying his golden ship in the ocean of the air Is this not clearly indicative of the moon? Further, onc of the aspects of Pusan&rsquo;s original character namely as a path finder can, in the light symbolism, be best transferred to the moon and not to the sun when darkness and difficulties obstruct the way, the moon appears as the real path finder Pusan, in his original character is regarded as a divine shepherd In the mythology of heaven and light, it is common to look upon the moon as the shepherd of the herds of stars This fact will make it clear how very natural the transition from Pusan to the moon god must have been Is it, again not possible to suppose that the horns of the goat the special apimal of Puson gave rise to the imagery of the horns of the crescent moon 770 Further, it is the moon god who is usually regarded as the divine symbol of &lsquo;growth&rsquo;, which is Pusan s special gift
One of the outstanding features of the Pusan mythology is the peculiar part played by that god in the obscure Suryā myth A critical analysis of that myth brings forth the following facts more or less prominently The basic conception underlying the myth is the representation of a typical heavenly marriage Surya

the sun maiden, is the bride and three different gods, namely, Asyins, Soma, and Pūsan, are represented as her wooers While AŚvins are referred to, in one context, as the husbands of Surya (IV 43 6), Soma also is, in another context, said to have been the real bndegroom (X 85 9) This appareat contradiction is explained away by it being suggested that Soma was Surya&rsquo;s first husband and that, in ber second marriage, which was a siayanıvara, she chose Aśvids as her husbands 7We are here concerned only with Pusan&rsquo;s role in thus myth It is said that gods gave Pusao, who was subdued by love, to Surya in marriage (VI 58 4 ) Probably as the husband of Surya, Pusan is connected with the marriage ceremonial, being besought to take the bride&rsquo;s hand and lead her away and to bless her in her conjugal relation (X 85 37)
Pusan&rsquo;s role as the wooer of Suryā has a two fold signi ficance - mythological and sociological From the point of view of the evolution of the Pusan mythology, we may assume that, in order to stabilize the fight symbolism superimposed upon the original character of Pusan, Vedic poets thought of introduc ing that god ja the Surya myth which must have then become very popular If we further assume that they regarded Pusan, in this second stage in the evolution of his personality, as the moon-god, it 15 casy to imagine how he is mode to play, in the Surya myth, &amp; part similar to that of Soma, who too had come, by that time, to be regarded as the moon god Apart from this mythological sigoificance, Pusan&rsquo;s introduction in the Suryā myth may have had a distinct sociological significance also By the side of the resplen. deot Süryā, the pastoral grucl eater Pusan certainly lends a peculiar touch to the whole myth Is it not likely that, on the strength of the precedent of this heavenly match between Surya and Pusan&ndash;the two divinitics belonging originally to two distinct

mythological strata&ndash;, the pastoral worshippers of Pusan desired to assert their own claims to matrimonial relations with tribes which, presumably, had already passed beyond the pastoral stage? The inyocation that Pus28 should allot to his worshippers their share of maidens (IX 67 10) would seem to support such conjecture Pusan&rsquo;s part in the Surya myth may then be regarded as the result of the impact of two Vedic communities having different social cultures It must be observed, in this connection, that myth building is not always based on clear cut issues But there cannot be much doubt that the Surya myth must have developed on the sociological background referred to above
It is further not improbable that the adjustments which the Vedic poets found it necessary to make after having once intro duced Pusan in the myth of Surya, AŠvips, and Soma, reflect the manners and social customs of the pastoral worshippers of Pusan Such adjustments were necessary in view of the fact that Suryā, the bride, was the sun maiden (who was regarded, rather confusedly either as the consort or as the daughter of the sun god), and Pusan, the suitor, was the moon god, who was often regarded as the son of the sun god The epithets of Pusan, namely, mātut didhısu,
suitor of the mother', and svasur parah, lover of the sister' (V 55 4–5), may be interpreted, on the one band, on the basis of the mythological imagery relating to Surya, the sun maiden, and Pusan, the son of the sun god On the other hand, these epithets which are suggestive of the motif of incest may be supposed to rcflcct the practice of Khveruk das marriages, that is to say, marriages among nicar relatives, which were current among some ancient Aryan tribes Such marriages must have formed a peculiat feature of the pastoral communities 74
The light aspect of Pusan s personality is, however, very super ficial and gives the impression of having been introduced by way of an afterthought It is also considerably hazy But, as point

PŪŞAN, THE PASTORAL GOD
115
out so far, in this stage, Pūsan seems to have been regarded by the Vedic poets as the moon-god. In this context, a reference may be made to a peculiar phenomenon of ancient mythology. The trapsition from the moon-symbolism to the sun-symbolism has always been its characteristic fcaturc. Many imageries connected with the sun-mythology, such as the sun-boat, sun-shovel, sud-egg, etc, can be traced back clearly to the special features of the moon.76 The two cults were consequently brought quite close 10 each other and the transition from the one to the other was almost imperceptible. When, therefore, the light-symbolism was not particularly distinct and clear-cut, it was quite possible to mistake one god for another. Such was actually the case as regards the evolution of the Puşan mythology. In the Veda itself there is no clear indication that Pūsan was regarded as a sun-god. But if, in later times, Pusan had come to be looked upon as a solar divinity, it must have been due to the usually imperceptible transition from the moon-symbolism to the sun-symbolism.
As the result of another outstanding characteristic of the Vedic mythology, some more features came to be added to the original Pūsan-religion. It has already been observed that, in the Veda, Pusan is coupled rather conspicuously with Indra (VI, 57 ) and Soma (II 40) This fact has a special significance. The original Pusan-religion of the nomadic pastoral communities fike that of the Bhāradvājas was essentially different from the religion of the Indra-worshippers, which may be regarded as having been more or less the official' religion of the Vedic people. Indeed, there are indications in the Veda that the pastoral god, Pūşan, evoked mockery at the hands of certain other people &ndash; perhaps priests and warriors — who worshipped gods of a different order (I. 42. 10; 138, 4; VI.56.1).76 In order that the gods of different Vedic tribes should combine in one great paatheon, the usual

VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
method adopted by the Vedic poets was to bring all such gods in contact with Indra who represented, so to say, the official religion of the RV sanihula Pusan s association with Indra which is, on the very face of it, superficial and artificial, serves the same purpose Originally there was a marked difference between Indra and Pusad so far as their food (VI 57 2) and vehicles (VI 57 3) were concerned But then Pusan came to be regarded as Indra&rsquo;s comrade and help-mate (VI 56 2,57 4) Not only that but Pusan and Indra came to be ultimately looked upon as brothers (VI 55 5) It will be thus seen that a position of honour in the Vedic paptheon was bestowed in this manner upon Pusan, the original pastoral god All this, however, is obviously late and artificial A similar purpose is served by Pusan&rsquo;s associa tion with Soma (II 40) Hereby Pusan s place in the Vedic ritual was made secure Pusan did not originally have any share in the Soma offering (VI 572) Later, the Pusan cult was loosely connected with Soma it seems likely that Pusan was then offered only half a sacrifice (VI 50 5) and that, ultimately, he claimed his full legitimate share in the Soma offering (X 26 5) A reference may be made here to the peculiar complex on the part of the worshippers of Pusan, who, while claiming a Soma offering for their god, also made Indra participate in Pusan&rsquo;s natural food karambha (III 52 7) This is obviously intended to assert the dignity of the original Pusan religion Ritual offerings are also said to have been made to both Soma and Pusan The Pusan cult is thus clearly one of the many appendages which have shot up in the Soma ritual Naturally, Pusan was also given several attributes in common with other gods in the Vedic pantheon He is called asura (V 51 11 ) and a ruler of heroes (1 1064) He becomes an unconquerable protector and defender (I 89 5) He is said to transcend mortals and is equal to the gods in glory (VI 48 19 )
There are thus primarily three kinds of impact that are reflected in the Pusan mythology The original pastoral religion of Pusan suggests that there was a tribal impact of an antagonistic character between the Bhātadvajas and the Panis An impact more or less of a social character is indicated by the Sūrya myth
PÜSAN, THE PASTORAL GOD
117
And finally, there was a religious impact which resulted in a place of honour being conceded to Pusan in the Vedic religion and ritual It is also not unlikely that some such adjustment gave rise to a peculiar feature of the Pusan cult That god was Origibally a pastoral divinity, but later on he seems to have been connected with agriculture also (IV 57 7) 77
The later development of the Pusan-cult will be found to betray unmistakably certain traits of that god&rsquo;s original character
The fact that Pūsan is supposed to lead the bride to the bride groom&rsquo;s house (X 85 26, Afvala yana GSI 81, Paraskara GS I 416) and also to lead the dead to the other world (X. 173) is the result of that god&rsquo;s natural lordship over the paths and of his nature as a path finder 78 The memory of Pūsan&rsquo;s special faculty to find lost things has survived in the myth that Pusan found the lost Soma (I 23 13-14) and Agni (X55) In
Alvalayana GS III 79, a sacrifice to Pūsan is recommended for getting the lost things restored In the afvamedha sacrifice, a goat is offered as Pusan&rsquo;s portion, in order to announce the sacrifice to the gods (I 162 2-4, TS V 612) This fact indicates, beyond doubt, the original pastoral character of Puşan The description in the Salapatha Brahmana (I 747) that Pusan is a toothless god is certainly based on that pastoral gads natural fondness for karambla That Brāhmana (as also TS II 6 8 2-7) has tried to rationalize, by means of a myth, that peculiar feature of Püsan, the proper significance of which was perhaps not realiscd then The same myth is developed in the later epic literature where we are told that, on a certain occa $100, god Rudra destroyed the tceth of Pusan &quot; [ Fint publwhed NIA 5, 1912, 49-66 )

<p>YAMA IN THE VEDA</p>
<p>Certain features of the Yama-mythology as represented in the Rgveda (RV) are apparently quite simple and uncomplicated This seeming simplicity itself has, however, misled many a scholar in the matter of the true interpretation of this mythology The picture of Yama - his personality and functions - as reconstructed from the RV references is characterised by considerable inconsis tency, discrepancy and vagueness An approach to this whole problem from the standpoint of evolutionary' mythology will alone make it possible to restate the whole Yama-mythology as a reasonably homogeneous and consistent whole
Let us first of all briefly recapitulate the several details of this mythology as given in the RV Only four complete hymns in the RV refer to Yama His name occurs about fifty times in the RV passages, which are almost exclusively to be found in the first and the tenth books of the RV Yama thus belongs, like Parjanya, to the fifth class or group of Vedic gods, on the basis of the frequency of the mention of his name This minor position held by Yama in the Vedic mythology indicates that the true nature of the personality of that god was already being tost sight of, the Vestiges of his original importance being revealed, as will be shown hereafter, only through stray references To begin with, a very significant fact about Yama is that he is never explicitly called a
god' in the RV He is no doubt mentioned in the company of other gods &ndash; with Agni and Matarisyan among others (I 164 46), with Varuna (X 14 7) with Brhaspati (X 14 3) and with Agni among others (X 64 3,92 11) In X 51 1, we are told that a god found the hiding Agni, in X 51 3, we are told that it was Yama, who found Agoi thus indicating indirectly that Yama was a god At the same time, it is equally significant that Yama is never called a man' As a matter of fact, he is clearly distin guished from the putrs (X 15 8), whose king and ford he is, though only once he is himself called pita (X 135 1) - obvi ously in a dufferent sense The mention of Yama and deid
YAMA IN THE VEDA
119
Varuna, side by side (X 14 7), does not at all indicate that the poet wanted to distinguish between man Yama and god Varuna. Other passages of that pature (III 205, IV 51 11 ) will show that such a reference does not possess any special significance Yama, however, is clearly a marty a according to AV XVIII 3 13 This unique aspect of Yama&rsquo;s character certainly provides an important clue for our investigation
The majority of Vedic references to Yama describe him as the lord of the blessed dead (X 14 3-7, 16 4) He is the first mortal, the first to go the way of death and to point out the path for the departed souls to follow (X 14 2) He is the gatherer of men, their guide and pathfinder (X 14 1) and gives men a resting place (X 14 9, AV XVIII 2 37) Of the three heavens, two belong to Sayıts and one to Yama (1 35 6 Also X 123 6)
Yama&rsquo;s father is said to have been Vivasvat and his mother Saranyu (X 14 5,17 1,2) In another context (X 10 4), however, the parents of Yama and his twin-sister, Yami, are mentioned to have been the Gandharva and the Water Nymph
Yama&rsquo;s abode is in the highest heaven (X 14 8), he dwells 10 the remote recess of the sky (IX 113 8 dnah avarodhanam? BLOOMFIELD, The Religion of the Veda, 144, translates this as
• heaven&rsquo;s firm abode') One has to cross mighty streams to reach there (X 14 1, AV YI 28 3, XVIII 4 7)' Reference is made to the harmijas for Yama (AV XVIII 4 55) and to
Yamasya sadananı' (X 135 7, AV II 12 7, XVIII 2 56, 3 70). Under a beautiful tree, Yama revels in the company of gods, there the father entertais kindly thoughts about the forefathers

(X 135 1) Yama is thus primarily regarded as a legendary king, who, by his boliness, was enabled to establish a realm of immortal life and bliss for the righteous of oiden time, to which good men of all generations had the right of entry In most RY passages, he is chiefly celebrated as the king of the blessed dead He assembles the flocks of the departed (X 14 1) in a marvellous kingdom, where there is neither cold nor suffering. He is the king (IX 113 8 ) and the father (X 135 1) He has found a way for many and along that path he leads men into their last abode ( X 14 2) Later, however, we see Yama&rsquo;s character in the process of change to bus post-Vedic role as the horrific judge of the dead He is brought in close connection with Death. Death is said to be the path of Yama (1 38 5) He is the brother of Mityu and is mentioned by the side of Antaka and Mrtyu (VS 39 13) Mrtyu is Yama&rsquo;s messenger ( AV XVIII 2 27) in certain cases Yama is even identified with Mrtyu (X 165 4, MS II 56, AV VI 28 3, 93 1) References to Yama&rsquo;s padbišu (X 97 16) to his messengers, ulūka and kapora (X, 165 4), and to his dogs (X 14 10-12) further help to consolidate his character as the fearful god of death
Let us now turn to a uniquc hymn, in which Yama ligures very prominently in a dialogue between Yama and his twin. $1$ter, Yami, (X 10) Yama is shown to be protesting strongly against the advances of Yam for a sexual intercourse which was intended for the procreation of the burdan race The impression derived from that hymn as a whole, however, is that, in spite of the suggestion of the apparently immoral motif of incest, Yama and Yami were then actually regarded as the first parents of the human race? Yama&rsquo;s protest only reflects the moral scruples of
the author of that hymn

Apart from these main references, attention may be drawn to other passages, which, thougb stray and obscure, are of consi derable importance Yama is said to have been the first to stretch the web of the human race or of sacrifice (VII 33 9) A reference is already made to Yama&rsquo;s hayıng discovered the hidden Agni (X 51 1-4) This fact also seems to represent Yama&rsquo;s function as the first sacrificer But Yama was not merely the first sacrificer', he was also the first sacrificed. For the sake of progeny, Yama, we are told (X 13 4), chose death, in spite of his deathless birth (1 83 5) be surrendered his own dear body in the sacrifice (X 13 4) The metres, which symbolise the sacrifice, are said to be deposited in Yama (X 14 16, AV XVIII 2 6 In such cases, Yama seems to be exalted almost to the position of an All god
Can these heterogeneous and, in many cases vague details of the Yama mythology in the Veda be presented in a systematic and consistent manner, indicating thereby the various successive stages in the evolution of that mythology?
Before we proceed further, it would be helpful to examine the views of earlier scholars in regard to Yama&rsquo;s personality and func tions The study of the Vedic mythology was, in its early stages, dominated by what may be called the naturalistic' tendency As a matter of fact, this was the case with regard to the study of all ancient mythologies It was normal to trace the origin of gods to natural phenomena Ancient mythology in general, and the Vedic mythology in particular, thus gods and moon gods Yama was, for instance, made to represent both the sun god and the moon god EHNI, who has written two independent research monographs on Yama, believes that Yama is primarily the deified representation of the sun, particularly the setting sun. He is the son of Vivasvat (whose light spreads afar'), who, according to EHNI, is the rising sun Yama follows the path of the sun to go to a remote recess The path of the sun

The sun is a bird and, like Yama, has birds as his messengers Like the sun god, Yama has two steeds, golden eyed and iron hoofed Vivasvat and Yama, who are related as father and son, stand, according to EHNI, respectively for the sun whose heaven 18 visible and the sun whose heaven is not visible This explains the suggested contrast between Vivasvat or the sun and Yama (AV XVIII 2 32, VS 24 1, SPB XIII 2 2 7) EHNI further speaks of Yama as the sun god and Yami as the moon goddess 10
Yama&rsquo;s character as a sun god, in one form or another, is accepted by several other scholars MAX MULLER, 1 for instance regards Yama as the god of the setting sun and, as such the leader of the Fathers According to WEBER, Yama represents the parting day and Yami the night 12 KUHN 13 and BERGAI GNE4 think that Yama is a form of Agni, particularly the lightning Agni 15 This difference of opinion itself indicates that the solar character of Yama is not at all clear BLOOMFIELD seems to support the solar character of Yama on the basis of the description of his two dogs According to that scholar, the two

A closer scrutiny of the descriptions of the dogs, however, shows that they are rather the outcome of a typical motif in primutive cult about death and of the common fantasy regarding the abode of the dead Their description is too minute to mistake them for any natural phenomena
HILLEBRANDT&rsquo;s starting point is the fact that Yama is the son of Vivasyat, whom that scholar regards as the sun god He further pays particular attention to the contrast between Yama and Vivasvat, which is often emphasised in the Vedic mythology and ritual 18 These facts, according to HILLEBRANDT, conclusively prove that Yama cangot be the sun god EHNI&rsquo;s explanation 10 regard to the contrast between the two19 is quite artificial and unconvincing That Yama is a &lsquo;god&rsquo;, and not an ordinary

death and birth of the moon HILLEBRANDT points to several Vedic passages where the moon is said to be the child of the sun (TX 93 1. AB VIII 28 14 ),21 and where he is referred to as dying and being reborn (I 164 4, X 55 5,85 19, ŚŚS 16 5) In support of his theory HILLEBRANDT further produces con siderable anthropological evidence from the writings of BRINTON, GRABNER, CROOKE, FRAZER, EHRENREICH, HARTLAND, and others 22 &ldquo;The primitive people all over the world often connect the phases of the moon with death, birth, regeneration, etc, and consequently regard the moon as the lord of the dead fathers Yama&rsquo;s part with reference to sacrifice is explained by HILLEBRA NDT also on the basis of his being the moon god for, the moon 3S the messenger of sacrifice, bripgs order in seasons, and distributes offerings anong the gods (I 105 4) Takıog for granted that Soma and Brhaspati also represent the moon god, HILLEBRANDT further quotes Vedic passages (like IX 2 10) wherein they are closely associated with sacrifice, and concludes that these ritualistic features are transferred to Yama because all the three gods represent but one divinity Yıma, the Avestan counterpart of Yama, is, according to HILLEBRANDT, closer to the moon god His final conclusion is that the lunar character of Yama was sot clearly realised by Vedic poets, who emphasised only one aspect of his personality, namely, his connection with the dead Yama was the moon god of the Indo Iranian or even earlier period Only in certain typical passages in the Veda do we still find the traces of Yama&rsquo;s ancient majesty as the moon. god
The theories, which make Yama represent one natural pheno menop or another, may be regarded as cancelling one another HILLEBRANDT has made it quite clear that Yama cannot be the sun god The apparent solar features of the Yama mythology referred to by EHNI and others are the outcome of the poetic con vention in the Veda, which was dominated by solar myths They

do not indicate the intrinsic character of Yama The.solarisation' of mythological elements, which are originally of an altogether different nature, is a normal feature of Vedic religion Indeed, such solarisation, which is often artificial serves some specific purpose ? At the same time it can also be shown that Yama did not originally represent even the moon god The character and function of Vivasvat, in the Veda and the Avesta, are very vague, and the statements regarding his relationship with Yama are characterised by contradiction and inconsistency (AV XVII 2 32, 3 61 62 ) 24 No theory based on Vivasvat&rsquo;s solar character and his connection with Yama can therefore, be in any way con vincing Moreover, Yama is represented in the Veda as possessing so very markedly human features that it is difficult to believe that it is merely a case of normal anthropomorphism To explain Yama&rsquo;s death on the basis of the satural phenomenon of the moon s phases is again not in the least satisfactory Firstly, Yama is never described as being reborn after his death like the moon He is never said to be undergoing periodical death and regeneration 25 Secondly, Yana s death unlike that of the moon, is of the nature of self immolation and serves a definite purpose Yama is, again, not only the first to die, but he is also the first parent of the human race, which fact does not fit well, even anthropologically, in the moon theory Yama&rsquo;s role as the first sacrificer is of special significance He is not, like the moon, merely a messenger of sacrifice or anything of that sort He is both the sacrificer and the sacrificed and as such as more intrinsi cally connected with sacrifice To bring forth references to Soma and Bghaspati in support of the connection of the moon with sacrifice amounts to depending on unproved assumptions Any attempt to prove Yama s solar or lunar character on the evidence of the Avestan Yıma mythology is, again, bound to fail, for, Yıma

is all along described to have distinctly possessed the personality of a human sovereign The myth of Yama and Yami as the first parents of the human race becomes entirely meaningless if that pair were assumed to be representing specific natural phenomena The tone of the whole dialogue between the twin brother and sister is unmistakably human and its theme is, without doubt, the procreation of mankind HILLEBRANDT&rsquo;s suggestion that Yama, the son of Vivasvat, should be distisguished from Yama, the brother of Yami 26 cannot possibly be accepted — indeed, it is discarded by all other scholars — and only indicates the weakness of his hypothesis Finally, the naturalistic' theories about Yama entirely disregard the true significance of the name, Yama The derivation and the explanation of the name given by EHNI and HILLEBRANDT are linguistically defective It may also be pointed out that, in a Vedic passage (X 64 3), Yama 15 distinguished from the sun and the moon in very clear terms 27
One fact thus becomes absolutely self evident as the result of our foregoing investigations, namely, that Yama did not, at any stage, represent any natural phenomenon While, therefore, discarding the naturalistic interpretations of the Yama mythology, ROTH also denies Yama s divine character 28 HOPKINS follows the lead given by ROTH and traces in detail the whole develop ment of Yama&rsquo;s personality and functions According to that scholar Yama is the first human being and as such becomes, with Yami the progenitor of the human race He is incidentally the first sacrificer as also the first earthly king and ruler 29 As Yam3 was the first human being to be born, the Vedic poets naively regarded him also as the first human being to die The next patural step was to regard the first mortal who died as the founder of a new colony of the dead where all who died subsequently had to go Yama the first to be born and the first to die thus be comes the guide, the pathfinder, and the lord of the departed souls

In course of time he almost comes to represent the ideal side of ancestor worship He becomes the poetic or symbolic image of all fathers It is this phase of the Yama mythology, which is primarily represented in the Veda Yama&rsquo;s comparison with Avestan Yıma abundantly supports this view
A more or less similar view is put forth by OLDENBERGS and SCHERMAN 31 According to OLDENBERG the original character of Yama is that of the first ruler rather than that of the first sacrificer Yama, like Yıma, was a king in a golden period OLDENBERG further points out that men in that golden period, who lived with Yama on the earth, also went to thc other world, where he ruled as the king of the dead, and became his special companions Angirases and others ( X 14 ) may thus be said to have belonged to Yama&rsquo;s first order of noblemen SCHERMAN believes that Yama was originally a human figure, who was later elevated to the status of, if not identified with, the sun god That scholar disputes the generally accepted opinion that, ia the early period, Yama was a kindly sovereign, who, in later times, became the dread king of horrible hells $2
Compared with the naturalistic' theories, these “humanistic' theories regarding Yama seem to come closer to the true interpre tation of the Yama-mythology 33 But they too can be accepted, not in all their details, but only partially Their insistence on the human character of Yama is based on the fact that Yama is never mentioned as god in the Veda But they do not seem to have pro perly estimated the other fact as well, namely, that Yama is also never mentioned as a map He is a mortal', and, as CARNOY

has pointed out,34 according to the primitive belief, &lsquo;man&rsquo; is supposed to be a &lsquo;god&rsquo; who has become mortal Morcover, as is shown elsewhere, there are several references to Yama, in the Vedic literature, which unmistakably indicate his divinity Further, it may be pointed out that this character of Yama as a &lsquo;mortal&rsquo; is Dot the result of naive speculation Yama dics first, not because he is born first, but because he immolates himself as a pecessary condition for the procreation of mankind Undue emphasis 15 placed, in these theories, on an incidental aspect, namely, Yama&rsquo;s kingdom in paradise The part played by Yama with reference to the creation of the universe and the procreation of the human race and also his special connection with sacrifice are not adequa tely explained on the assumption that Yama was just a human being, who died first and as such attained to heaven before every one else and thus became the lord of the paradisial abode of the blessed souls Yama, as a matter of fact, possesses, in the Vedic mythology, the peculiar character of a &lsquo;god man&rsquo;
Yama&rsquo;s personality as a whole cannot thus be satisfactonly explained on the basis of the sun theory or the moon theory, or the first man theory The Yama mythology is far too complex to be comprehended by any such simple formula The Vedic poetry and the Vedic mythology are, to a very considerable extent, domina ted by artificial poetic and priestly conventions The original nature of the myths is, therefore often shrouded in a large Amount of extraneous and conventional details, which, many times, give those myths quite a different appearance It is only in certain typical references to a Vedic god, which are usually stray and scattered, and which are, therefore, regarded as inconsistent and obscure, that we have to seek for the traces of the true character of that god There are, in the Veda, some passages, which have luckily escaped priestly revision and have retained their original form Such passages have, in most cases, provided the proper starting point for the reinterpretation of Vedic mytho logy This is particularly the case with regard to the so-called

minor gods of the Vedic pantheon Another point which should be noted in this connection is that, besides comparative philology, new research in comparative mythology has pecessarily to keep pace with and take into account the remarkable progress that has been made in anthropology and folklore
We shall start our present investigation with the study of a reference to Yama, which is usually considered to be obscure and vague In X 13 4, we read

the cause of the origin of the world and the human race is quite common in ancient cosmogonic mythologies It was believed by several primitive communities that a primeval being of divine' or cosmic character, but possessing a human form, was immolated in a sacrifice and out of his limbs originated the several aspects of creation Reference may be made in this connection, among others, to the Babylonian myth of the creation of the heaven and the earth from the two halves of Goddess Tiāmat, and to a similar myth about the giant Banio It is highly instructive to consider in this context the ancient Germanic myth of Tusto and Ymir In Edda (II), we are told that in the primeval times when Ymjr lived, when there was neither sand por sea, neither earth 1101 heaven above, from Ymir&rsquo;s flesh was the earth created, out of his blood the ocean, mountains from his bones and trees from his hair, from his skull the heaven originated' This motif, it may be pointed out, is common to several ancient mythologies, ipdogermanic and non indogermanic 38
So far as the RV is concerned we find two main versions of this cosmogonic mythological motif of the primeval sacrifice - one in the reference to Yama in X 13 4 and the other in the famous Purusasukta 37 The latter may be said to be merely a more detai ed and more elaborate priestly form of the former According to the version in X 13 4 it is one of the gods himself who surrenders his own body for sacrificial immolation thus serving the cause of the gods and progeny alike That god, Yama, is thus different from the other gods This unique character of Yama is indicated in the RV by the fact that that Veda refers to him not as a god (because he surrenders his immortality) nor as a man (because his act of self immolation for the sake of creation is far
36 Tor a detailed statement on the subject sec GUENTERT, Der arische JVelikontig und Haland 315 ff It is suggested that such cosmogopuc motif may have artsen out of some primitive fertility cult

too &lsquo;cosmic&rsquo; or &lsquo;divine&rsquo; for an ordinary human being but simply as a martja The two conceptions of cosmic' or &lsquo;divine on the one hand and human&rsquo; on the other are thus tactfully represented there In The Purusasukta, the offering in the primeval sacrifice of the gods is said to have been the agrarah jāta purusa (X 90 7), whose description, such as sahasrasırsan sahasraksa, etc (X 90 1), however, indicates that his character was quite different from that of the ordinary purusas This purusa is again amrtariasja išana and compreheods everything Thus, here too, an attempt is made to preserve the above mentioned conception of cosmic, divine nature and human form, which are common in all myths about the primeval sacrifice The basic motif in the cse of Yama and Purusa is thus the same, namely, the immola.
tion of a god man for the sake of creation 38
There is another significant conception, which is often asso ciated with the motif of the immolation of the primeval being Just as the primeval being is regarded to possess the nature of
god man', so too it is regarded to possess the nature of a male female or of a hermaphrodite 38
The character of the Purusa as a sexually unseparated being is made evident by the opening verses of the Purusasukta and by the fact that the Purusa creates out of himself a female form, viraj In the case of Yama, on the other hand, his androgynous charac ter is not directly mentioned But it can certainly be assumed on the strength of the evidence of the analogies of other primitive mythologies and of the evidence deriyed from the linguistic consi.
38 It is of course difficult to accept y Norman Brown&rsquo;s suggestion (40S 51, 108-18 that Purusa in the Purgasukta is a blend of eledcats drawn from Ago), Surya, and Visou fused in a rather shadowy way, 10 a new unity with special reference to the sun or is it necessary to assume, 2 LARRARKAR doet (7BBRAS 18, 91-93) that the idea of the Purura sacrifice 24 an attempt on the part of the Aryans to compromisc with the Proto-Draysdians of Mohoujo-Daro

deration of the name Yama As GUNTERT has clearly pointed out,40 the word yama can be linguistically connected with two series of words - on the one hand, with Ay yema, Lett jumis Mir emuin, all meaning twins', and on the other, with Lat geminus, gemelhes and Gk didumos, which mean both twin' and *hermaphrodite' A closer examination of the words of this type indicates that the two conceptions of twin and bisexual being are usually represented by similar words GUNTERT&rsquo;s thorough investigation of the name Ymir and the Icelandic mythology associated with that name is very colightening in this respect Ymir of the Edda and Yama of the Veda are mythologically as also linguistically (morphologically and phonetically) related to each other They are the two Indogermanic representations of the basic motif of a hermaphrodite primeval being offering itself for immolation 10 sacrifice for the sake of the creation of the Universe and human race 12 The Purusa of the Purusasukta is only a priestly modification of the original mythical conception of Yama It may be pointed out that the same cosmogonic motif of an androgynous Urwesen is also represented in the Brhad Up I 4, where we read ārma ve idam agra ásit purusavidhah sa ha etāvān asa yathā stripumāmsau samparisvahtau of a similar purport are further the passages in the Kath (XIII 7), where Prajāpati is said to have assumed a bisexual form because he did not have any other person for pairing, and in the Art Br ([[[ 33 ). according to which, Prajāpati appears in the form of an antelope united with his sister 43

&lsquo;ogenitor of the human race, which characterises this stage, is iggested by the name, Yama, which basically means a bisexual eing, and by the fact that the counterparts of Yama in other rimitive cosmogonic mythologies possess a similar character. It nust, however, be said that, as it has happened in several other ases in the Veda, the originally very expressive name of Yama &gt;st its basic significance and it soon degenerated into a colourless ppellation The other current of thought, which characterises his stage, namely, the immolation of the god man for the sake of reation is happily preserved in a clear reference to Yama&rsquo;s self mmolation in X 13 4 The connection of Yama with sacrifice s thus of a very special nature He is the first sacrificer, the first o stretch the web of mankind and sacrifice (VII 33 9-10), which was further extended by Vasistha He was also the first to serve as the sacrificial offering All this alone would rationally explain why in certain stray passages, which are otherwise obscure,
sama is so highly elevated with reference to jajña (AV XVIII 2 32 ) The metres symbolising the magical power of sacrifice are said to be deposited in Yama (X 14 16 ) Moreover, Yama 15 also seen to have been exalted almost to the position of an All god because he was the universe itself Yama&rsquo;s close relation with Ago (X 51 1-3, 64 3, 92 11) may also be explained on the basis of this motif of Yama&rsquo;s primeval sacrifice
The primitivc motif of the immolation of an androgynous primeval being for the sake of the creation of the universe is, 10 some cases, found in a shghtly modified form The original myth came to be regarded as too raw and uprefined particularly with reference to the procreation of the human race The herma phrodite Urwesen, therefore, was represented to have separated itself into a male and a female, who came to be duly recognised as the first parents of mankind As these two were the offspring of the same being they were supposed to be related to each other as brother and sister They were also regarded as twins This is exactly what seems to have happened in the evolution of the Yama mythology Yama, the hermaphrodite Urnesen, gave place to a pair of twins who were regarded as the parents of

mankind &quot; As the result of the peculiar linguistic phenomenon, which we have already noticed, the same word, jama, possessed the two senses of a bisexual being and a twin Even in this second stage, therefore, the name Yama was preserved to denote the male twin, though the character and function of this Yama were materially different from those of the Yama of the first stage in the development of the Yama-mythology Yama and his twin sister Yami, whose name is formed in obvious imitation of that of Yama, became the progenitors of the human race 15 Yama&rsquo;s original function as the creator of the universe was thus considerably restricted This aspect of the Yama mythology, in the course of its evolution, is preserved 1n a whole hymn in the RV (X 10) It is, however, represented there in quite a different light The conception of an incestuous idtercourse between the twin brother and sister, Yama and Yami giving rise to the human race became positively offensive to the conventional moral sense of the Vedic poets and priests The real motif of that episode was, therefore, altogether changed and was presented in quite a different perspective Yama is shown there as protesting strongly against the amorous advances of his twin-sister Yami He draws Yami&rsquo;s attention to the law of rta (X 10 2, 6, 8), which does not warrant an incest between brother and sister An attempt is made by the Vedic poet to suggest that Yama and Yamı were not the first parents of the human race, for, they themselves are represented to have parents, namely, the Gandharva and the Water-Nymph (X. 10 4) The poet further suggests that Yama and Yami were not the first human beings by making Yama direct Yami to a person other than himself (X 10 8, 10, 12, 14), as if such a person actually existed But, 10 spite of all his efforts, the Vedic poct could not entirely obliterate from that hymn certain details, which clearly betray the true nature of that myth Yami is represented in that

hymn as being heen - quite naturally, too - on the procreation and the furthcrance of the race The procreative instinct of the female is quite unmistakable there Moreover, a very clear men tion is made in that hymn (X 10 3 ) of the fact that Yama was the only male in existence at that time Does this not indicate that Yama was the first human being to exist ? The colourless and very impersonal character of the so called parents of Yama and Yami at oncc betrays that their inciusion, by the poet, in the hymn was obviously an afterthought The Vedic poet has tried to make the ancient myth of Yama and Yami a vehicle for a sermon on ria, moral law, - but, undoubtedly, without success For, as it is, the hymn appears to end abruptly The poet does Dot make it clear whether the incest actually took place or not, obviously because the answer to that question would have pullified the poet&rsquo;s purpose There seems to be, therefore, 10 reason to doubt that the hymo contains in spite of its tendentious perver sion by the poet, which only reflects the morality of his age, unmistakable traces of a distinct form of the Yama mythology, according to which Yama and Yami, the twin brother and sister, Were considered to be responsible for the procreation of the human race through an inccstuous union
The motif of the androgynous Urucsen separating itself is clearly preserved in the Purusasūkta The Urncsen (Purusa) created out of itself a female form, traj,&rsquo; who, in her turn, produced thc purusa, who may be regarded as the symbol of further procrtation (X. 90 5) The primeval Purusa is thus at once made responsible for the creation of the macrocosm as well as microcosm - of course, in different ways it will be seen that tbc self immolation of the biscrual Yama, representing the Grst stage in the csolution of the Yama mythology, as also the myth of the twins, Yama and Yami, procrcating the human race, which represents the second stage, arc both prcscrved, in a modificd form, in thc Purusasūkta Though Yama&rsquo;s onginal character as a hermapbrodite god man and as the first tivin parcot 15 relegated

to stray and obscurc refcrcnccs,&rsquo;t it has been, so to say, resurrec. ted in the form of the Puruşa of the Purusasūkta The ongios1 Yama myth and the Purusa myth arc thus organically connected with cach other
It cannot, however, be denied that there was among the con ventional Vedic priests and roots a strong prejudice against this myth of an inccstuous union between the tuns As the result of this prcjudice of the Vedic hicrarchy, Yami disappeared from the Yama mythology as silently as she was introduced in it No further rcference to Tami is available in the RI&rsquo; Conscqucotly, out of the pair of twins Yama alonc remained as the arst bora progenitor of mankind Associated with this progenitorship of the human racc nc find, in the Veda, also faint traces of Yama&rsquo;s sovereignty on carth Himself a mortal', Yama is regarded as the leader of the human fact, its king ruling in an earthly paradise This aspect is specially emphasised in the case of Yama&rsquo;s Iranian counterpart, Yım (Jamshed) who, according to Vd II 4-19, was the kingly ruler in whose rciga the golden age of the world prevailed &quot; It was from Ahura Mazdah limself that Yıma received the command to further and increase the world The plenitude of life and increase on earth form the dominating features of Yama&rsquo;s rule No special reference is made to this aspect of the Yama mythology in the Veda There arc, all the same, some indications which unmistakably point to it. The possession by Yama of the padbisa (X 97 16), which corres ponds to the pasa of Varuna and which may be regarded as the symbol of sovereignty, seems to be one of the remnants of Yama s kingship Yama&rsquo;s particular association with Varuna (X 14 7), who, in course of time, came to be regarded as the typical sovereigo in the Vedic mythology, can be adequately

Another myth about the progenitor of the human race was, oul this time, being developed in the Vedic mythology - the th of Manu, the first man Manu is mentioned in the Veda as : father of the human race (1 80 16 ) and as the first sacrificer III 43 13, X 63 7) The legend of Manu&rsquo;s deliverance from dood by the fish (SPB I 8 1 1) clearly 10dicates his function the progenitor and leader of mankind 51 He is the son of vasvat, and Manu Vaivasvata came to be regarded as the symbol the first man', the first sacrificer', and the first ruler'. anu was thus more or less a &lsquo;double&rsquo; of Yama. There was, erefore, naturally enough, considerable mutual interaction tween the Manu myth and the Yama myth To begin with, the lapu myth completely overshadowed the stage in the develop cnt of the Yama mythology, which has just been referred to ama&rsquo;s character as the progenitor and the first sovereign of the uman race was almost relegated to oblivion and can now only e inferred from stray references to it in the Veda The strong rejudice of the Vedic hierarchy against the Yama Yami myth had Tready prepared the ground for this The legends of Many were uch as could easily conform to the conventional attitude of the &lsquo;edic poet-priests The mour of incest in the Yama mythology Cems to have been particularly responsible for the withdrawal of

Yama from the Vedic cosmogonic mythology and the priestly emphasis on Yama&rsquo;s double, Manu, as the first man Yama&rsquo;s role of the first sacrificer, which was associated with the myth of the primeval sacrifice of the hermaphrodite god man, soon became Tepulsive to the Vedic priests and poets, and thereafter, came to be transferred to Manu Secondly, the parallelism between the Yama myth and the Purusa myth helped to bring the Yama myth and the Manu myth close together This was due to a peculiar linguistic fact The word Manu is employed to denote specifically the progenitor of the human race as well as man in gederal That word and the word purusa, which also signifies man, were thus more or less synonymous Yama and Purusa, on the other hand, were almost identical in personality and character The natural next step from these two equations - the linguistic equie tion, Purusa = Manu, and the mythological equation, Purusa = Yama - was to closely associate Yama and Manu We have already pointed out the simularity between the myths of Yama and
There 18 thus considerable intermixture of mythical motifs and names in the whole Yama Purusa Manu-mythology It may be assumed that the original nature and functions of Yama, wbich were tendentiously put into the background as the result of the Vedic conventionalism, did persist, albert 10 a modified form, through Parusa and Manu
Beforc Yama was completely superseded by Manu in tre progenitorship of the human race, the two myths existed side by side and the necessity was felt to adjust thern somehow or other The efforts in this direction, which are quite obvious in the Vedic mythology, themselves form an evidence in support of Yamas role as the progenitor of mankind In the Vedic mythology Yama and Manu came to be regarded as brothers - both sons of Vivasvat That is how Vivasvat was introduced &ndash; artificially and superficially in the Yama mythology as the father of Yama Vivasyat, we are told in RV (X 17 i ff ), married Saranyu, the daughter of Tvastr They werc the parents of Yama The gods later concealed the immortal bride, Saranyu, from the mortals, and, makiog another of like appearance, Savarna, they gave her

to Vivasvat Vivasvat and Savarnā gave birth to Manu 52 An attempt is thus made to point out that Yama and Manu were not identical, Yama was of divine birth, while Manu was not It need hardly be added that all this is obviously an after thought
In spite of all this, the Yama mythology was not completely effaced from the Vedic literature Quite an unexpected feature of Yama&rsquo;s original character came to be prominently emphasised and was interpreted in an altogether different light Yama, as we bave seen, offered himself for immolation in the primeval sacrifice, for the sake of the gods and progeny Out of the three conceptions included in this cosmogonic myth, pamely, that of the hermaphrodite primeval god man, that of the creation of the universe and the human race, and that of the self immolation, it was the last that pow came to be stressed Yama inmolated himself at the beginning of existence, that is to say, in other words, Yama was the first being to die The adjustment between the Manu myth and the Yama myth was thus considerably simpli fied Many was the first born&rsquo;, Yama was the first to die The further evolution of the Yama mythology is clearly traceable in the Veda Yama dies first and attains to heaven before every one else Leaviog the kragdom of earthly paradise, he assumes the sovereignty of the heavenly paradise He is the forerunner of all the departed souls and becomes their guide and pathfinder There he rules over the blessed ones, as the benevolent father of * fathers', and is worshipped, with the pitts, as thc first witness of an immortality, to be enjoyed by the fathers, similar to the im mortality cojoyed by the gods themselves One point should be clearly borne in mind in this connection, and it is that, though Yama is closely associated with the spirits of the dead, he never assumes the horrific role of the demon of death It is this stage in the evolution of the Yama mythology, pamely, of Yama as the ruler of the blessed dead, tliat is primarily represented in the RV A significant feature of the primitive cult about the dead and their

ruler, namely, the conception of the two dogs guardiog the region of the dead, is now transplanted upon the Yama mythology -
It was at this stage that the Rudra mythology seems to have significantly reacted on the Yama mythology 54 Consequently Yama&rsquo;s association with death' as such began to figure rather prominently Death is said to be Yama&rsquo;s puth (1 38 5) Yama is mentioned side by side with Mrtyu and Antaka, and is even identified with Mrtyu (X 165 4, MIS II 5 6, AV, VI 28 3, 93 1) The benevolent ruler of the blessed souls, the helpful father of &lsquo;fathers, who had originally nothing to do with &lsquo;death&rsquo; as such, and whose proper function, even as represented in a later stage, commenced after death&rsquo;, now came to be identified with death The dogs of death, the inauspicious messengers, ulūka and kapota the padbisa, which was now regarded as the instrument of punishment, - all these traits helped to make Yama an object of terror The conception of Yama&rsquo;s role as the fearful and restraining&rsquo;god of death must have been facilitated also by the popular derivation of the word jama from the root yam to restrain ), which, though normally possible, is not acceptable in this case on account of the difficulties of Vedic accentuation which it would create But it is thus aspect of Yama&rsquo;s personality which has been preserved prominently in the later Hindu mytho logy

Vedic mythology, as we generally know it from the Rgreda (RV), is clearly dominated by the personality of Indra By far the largest number of suhtas - about 250 out of 1028 — are ex clusively devoted to the glorification of this god Apart from these suktas, there are several others, wherein Indra is praised in association with other gods or is referred to in some other connec tion Indra is thus obviously the most popular god of the Vedic pantheon He has always been regarded almost as the very sym bol of the official Vedic religion&ndash;the Indra mythology being very nearly identified with the Vedic rcligion as a whole It is true that Indra is celebrated in nearly one fourth of the RV, but this fact must not be taken to indicate, as is usually done, that the Vedic religion had all along been dominated by the Indra my thology Such an assumption could only be the result of study ing the Vedic mythology as if it were a static phenomenon and would make it difficult rationally to correlate several mytho logical concepts in the Veda with the facts derived from the study of comparative philology, comparative mythology, anthropo logy, and the cultural history of the Aryans A critical study of the Veda would show that the Vedic mythology is essentially an cvolutionary mythology, that, at different stages in the cvolution of the Vedic mythological thought it has been domi nated by different Vedic gods, and that the Indra-dominated mythology represents but a lic stage in the course of that cyolu tion There is another aspec the Vedic mythology It will be seen that the personality of a Vedic god normally presents a cry complex picture it often contains ciements which are mutually inconsistent or sometimes cien self-contradictory Tlus peculiar inythological plicnomc. non can be satisfactoriis explained only on the assumption that a cdic god possesses a growing' personality with the dific reat vicissitudes in Vedic life and culture, different elements came

to be introduced into the personality of a Vedic god In other words, the dynamic character of the life of the Vedic people is faithfully reflected in the complex make up of their gods To emphasize only certain specific clements in a god&rsquo;s personality and thus try to define his character, one way or another, would, therefore, be unsound What we have to do is to determine, 10 the light of the facts derived from the study of comparative philo logy, comparative mythology, anthropology, and the cultural history of the Aryans, the prionty of these varied elements, and thereby present, so to say, a complete history of the entire be coming' of a Vedic god A study of the Vedic god, Indra, from the point of view of this two fold evolutionary character of the Vedic mythology, would lumine several obscure points concern ing the Vedic mythology in general and the personality of Indra in particular
If we were to analyse the large number of the RV-passages referring to Indra and his activities, we would find that they present three main strands of the personality and character of that god Indra is presented as a cosmic power, as a warlıke leader of the Vedic Aryans, and as an ancient mythical dragon killing hero Most of the descriptions of Indra are centred round his war with and subsequent victory over Vrtra This is by far the most outstanding event in Indra&rsquo;s career A proper under standing of this event would, therefore, serve as an adequate starting point for a critical study of Indra&rsquo;s personality and character We may begin with an ancient traditional attempt at interpreting this contest between Indra and Vitra Yaska, the author of the Niruksa, has posed the question ko yrtrah who was Vytra? He has mentioned two principal views regarding this question it appears that, more or less by way of a purva paksa, he refers to the opinion of the Aitihasikas who believed that Vrtra was a demon, a son of Tvastī Without, however, caring to discuss and refute this view, Yaska states the view of the school of the Nairuktas, who held that Vịtra represented a

cloud This passage from the Nirukta would thus clearly show that, even since very early times, there have been two principal schools of interpretation of the Vedic mythology &ndash; the historical school and the naturalistic school The etymologists, among whom Yaska was the foremost adhered to the naturalistic inter pretation The influence of the naturalistic school on Vedic studies in general has, indeed, been very great, and many scholars belonging to the earlier generation of modern Vedists accepted, without demur and almost as the final solution of the problem, the theory that the Vedic gods represented various powers of nature and that the Vedic mythology consisted of symbolical descriptions of various phenomena of nature Incidentally, it may be pointed out that, among themselves, the naturalistic mytho logists are not unanimous as to which specific power of nature a particular Vedic god represents in pursuance of the naturalistic idcology, the Vedic gods are classified into three categories those belonging to the sky, those belonging to the mid region and those belonging to the earth, in accordance with the cosmic regions where the powers of nature represented by those gods normally become evident
The most dominant view so far as the naturalistic inter pretation of the Indra mythology is concerned, is the one suggest ed by Yaska His lead has been followed by a majority of the carly Vedists of the modern times Indra is said to be the personification of thunderstorm He stands at the head of the gods of the antariksa and is verily the rain god of the Vedic pan. theon The heavenly waters are obstructed by the cloud demon, Vpira Indra, therefore, smites down this cloud demon by means of his vajra or thunderbolt, and releases the waters, which then flow down in the form of rain showers The various descriptions, in the RV, of the Indra-Vrtra battle are said to be cleariy jadi cative of the phenomena of thunderstorm, lightning, and rain Heaven and carth tremble with fear when Indra strikes Vitra with

indu, are related to each other, and that, as suggested by MAX MULLER,Indra may have thus been associated with drops of rain water &amp; It has been further suggested by some of the scho lars mentioned above that there was a two fold development of this basic character of Indra On the one hand, from a mere god of thunderstorm, he was elevated to the position of an all. god- of the creator and director of the entire universe (I 52 14, II 30 1, IV 30 22, X 54 5), and on the other, the Vedic poets brought about the humanization of Indra&rsquo;s divind and cosmic person and described him as a human hero and war lord (1 10 3, 130 8, IV 26 3, VI 18 3, VIII 14 5, 24, 27 6, X 49 2)
Let us critically examine the theory that Indra is the raja god in the Veda It must be mentioned, at the very outset, that there undoubtedly are, in the personality of Indra as represented in the RV, a large number of elements of the character of a rain god But we may ask can these elements be said to be the basic elements in Indra&rsquo;s character? And, secondly, con these ele ments alone be said to indicate the entire personality and character of that god? A minute and careful consideration of the descriptions in the RV of the Indra-Vrtra-contest brings out some significant facts in this connection It will be seen that, in all such descriptions, the words like thunder!, cloud&rsquo;s * lightning&rsquo;, &lsquo;rain&rsquo;, etc, seldom occur directly The waters, which Indra is credited with having released and let flow, are often terrestrial, rather than celestial, waters The terms, which are frequently used in these passages, are &lsquo;thunderbolt&rsquo;, &lsquo;moun tain&rdquo;, fortresses&rsquo;, &lsquo;cows&rsquo;, &lsquo;light&rsquo;, &lsquo;waters&rsquo;, etc One would, therefore, be justified in asking whether the main intention of the Vedic poets could have really been to suggest the phenomena of

thunderstorm and rain through the symbolism of the Indra Vitra war * The occurrence, in the RV, of poetic symbolism is, it may bc pointed out, guite understandable But at least once in a while we should have come across Vedic passages which are un cquivocably indicative of the phenomenon of rain Indeed, BERGAIGNE seems to be right when he suggeststo that there is in the RV, no clear mention of Indra&rsquo;s being responsible for the rain fall&rdquo; The symbolism of vajra, pariata, pur, gauh, etc, can bc interpreted and this, more or less satisfactorily &ndash; in several ways As a matter of fact, it is actually interpreted variously It is, verily, difficult to understand why the Vedic poets should have described the basic character and exploits of their principal god in such vague and undefinite terms
The identification of Indra with the rain god is based on some other identifications, which seem to be taken for granted Indra&rsquo;s vajra for instance, is understood to be the regular mytho logical name for lightning But do the Vedic passages referring to vajra support such an exclusive assumption? The ajra is generally described as ajasa or metallic (I 52 8, 57 2) It is said to be four aogled (IV 22 2), hundred angled (VI 17 10), hundred jointed (VIII 6 6), and thousand pointed (I 80 12) It is sharp (VII 18 18 ) and Indra whets it like a kaife (1 55 I, 130 4) Such descriptions are too specific to be regarded as symbolically indicative of lightning Moreover, though ajra is ludra&rsquo;s special weapon, it is not the only weapon which he uses He is sometimes descobed as being armed with a bow and arrows</li>

Another equation, on which the rain-god theory is based, is that Vrtra is the cloud demon Several objections can be raised against this equation To begin with, it may be pointed out that the word varathra occurs frequentlyi n the Avesta That that word is philologically the ancient Iranian cognate of the Vedic word yrtra is beyond any shade of doubt In a subsequent part of this paper, we shall have to consider the word vrtra in all its aspects In the present context, however, it may be pointed out that in the Avesta, the word varathra does not signify a cloud demon even remotely Further, in che Ayesia, we come across a god called Vrthragna, but he is in no way connected with the rains 13 Again, supposing that Indra was the rain.god in the Vedic mythology, no rational explanation can be given of the fact that Aodra, who is obviously the ancient Iranian counterpart of Iadra, is represented in the Aresta, as an obnoxious demon Why should a mere rain god of the Veda have been transformed
into the third worst devil in the Iranian mythology?
In the descriptions of the Indra-Vrtra contest the Vedic poets have frequently used certain words and idioms in a more or less technical sense, such as, for instance, api+dhā, gras, bādh, rudh, vr, stabh, pari+stha, etc HILLEBRANDT has made a critical and analytical study of all such words and has come to the conclusion that they do not fit in well with the phenomenon of rain&rdquo;. It will be thus seen that the descriptions, in the RV, of the Indra Vţtra-contest are such as do not warrant the assumption that they indicate, primarily and unequivocally, the phenomenon of rain Even if the symbolism in those descriptions is considered from the naturalistic point of view, it may be possible to interpret it in terms of some other natural phenomena as well It does not,

therefore, stand to reason to suggest, on the strength of such in. definite evidence, that Indra is basically a rain god
There is another significant point to be noted in this connec tion In the Vedic mythology there are three dividities which are more or less closely connected with the phenomenon of rain
Tria Aptya, Parjanya, and Indra from among these three, Indra seems to be later than the other two As a matter of fact, Indra secms to have been added to the Vedic pantheon later than many other gods The tradition preserved in the Taitti rija-Brahmona (II 2 3 3, II 2 7 2) pamely, that Prajapati created all gods but not ladra and that Indra was later gene rated among them as a new power is highly significant in this connection lodra is referred to in the Taimurija Samhita (II 34 2) as deanam anwjāsara Under these circumstances, a question may occur why did the Vedic poets feel the necessity of creating a new rain god when they already had two in their pantheon If, op the other hand, it is suggested, for the sake of argument, that the concept of Indra is earlier than that of either Parjanya or Trita Āptya, it may still be asked, and, perhaps, with greater validity, why the latter two apparently subsidiary rain. divinitics should have been thought of by the Vedic mythologist who already there existed, in the Vedic ponthcon, a very promie nent rain god, namely, Indra As regards Parjanya, it might be argued that between lodra and Parjanja there is no absolute similarity For, while Parjanya is the rain itself, Indra represents the rain giving god 18 No such distinction can be made between lodra and Trita Āptya The character of Parjanya, in the Veda, is quite transparent, but that of Trita Artya is rather vague and

thunders, and waters roar wandering in their course (V, 54 2770 Such a connexion can be confirmed also by an etymological consideration of the name, Āptya 17 In the RV, Trita some times appears in the special capacity of a preparer of Soma (II 11. 20, IX 32 2, 34 4, 38 2, 102 2) This secondary trait accruing to him must have obviously been the extension of his primary character, namely, that of the bringer of rains 19 A critical examination of the RV-passages referring to Trita brings forth an illuminating set of facts so far as his relations with Indra are concerned Though, in some passages, he appears as almost identical with Indra so far as his activities in connection with the rain phenomenon are concerned (I 187 1, VIII 7 24), there is absolutely no doubt that Indra and Trita were distinct persona lities Again, it would become quite clear that, though Indra also is called Aptya (X 120 6), Trita must have been the original Aptya The earlier occurrence in the Avesta of the ancient Ira pian counterpart of the latter, namely, Thrita, than that of Jodra 15, indeed, a significant piece of evidence in this connection

But a stul more significant piece of evidence as RV I 52 5, where ladra is described as having performed the feat of conquering the raio stealers in the manner of Tnta This passage clearly shows that the function of overcoming the cloud demons and releasing the celestial waters originally belonged to Trita, white, later on, lodra stepped into the shoes of that original Aryan rain god and imitated him in the explort of bringing rarns Trita&rsquo;s victory over the rain stealers must have been regarded as so primary and characteristic as achievement of his as to be mentioned as an illustration (1 52 5, V 86 1 )
Three distinct stages may be marked in the development of the rain god mythology in the Veda The Vedic poets must have originally glorified the rain god of their Aryan ancestors namely, Trita Aptya This god thus found a place in the mytho logies of both the branches of the Aryans, namely, the ancient Iranians and the Vedic Indians Later on, as the result of some peculiar mythological development among the latter, a new god ame to be regarded as tbe rain god in the Vedic mythology That god was Indra But even after Indra s celebration as a rain god, in the RV, the original Aryan rain god was not altoge ther forgotten As shown above Indra was desoribed as imitat ing Trita in his fent of conqucting the rain stealers (1 52 5) There arc, however, unmistakablc indications in the RV that Indra was gradually superseding the original rain god bepeyer Trita appcars with Indra the former is clearly represented as the subordinate of the latter (II 11 19 20, VIII 12 16, X 878, 99 6)* Moreover, a large number of Vedic passages sofersing to Trita arc such as would suggest that that god had been slowly bun Surely siaking into obuvibn Hc is never presented in cicat cod Jife hic form but is mentioned in cursory allusions Trita is

said to be dwelling 10 the farthest distance (1 105 9, VIII 47 13 17) because, as ROTH rightiy points out 21 he had gradually become more and more obliterated from memory 22 The fact that Trita is not at all mentioned in certain mandalas, such as, the second, the fourth, and the seventh particularly, the seventh &mdash; 15 also highly significant in this context 23 This sub Ordination of Trita by Indra represents the second stage in the evolution of the Vedic rain god mythology In the last stage, Trita, who was the original Aryan god of storm and rain, indeed older than Indra, was completely shelved into the background as the result of the growing popularity of lodra as the rain god It is suggested' that dim reminiscence of Trita&rsquo;s vanished glory and an allusion to his final subordination may be lurking in II 34 10 Trita is there said to have been given over to the derision of the worshipper All this discussion will have now made it amply clear that Indra was not the original rain god of the Veda, and that, as the result of some peculiar mythological development, the character of rain god was superimposed on his primarily different personality It may be incidentally pointed out, in this connec. tion, that the line of contact between the Indo European store gods on the one hand and the Vedic Indra on the other is nowhere distinct or even provable
It should be further remembered that Indra is a god, who originated and grew specifically among the Vedic Aryans If it were to be supposed that he had been a rain god from the very beginning, it would be difficult satisfactorily to explain why the Vedic poets should have created a Dew rain god of a specifically Indian ongın Moreover the facts that Indra was elevated to the position of the national god of the Vedic Indians and that he came to be regarded as the truc symbol of their official religion

22 The few Alhartaveda passages referring to Trita also suggest the idea of a remote god

There is one more point, which definitely goes against nc assumption of Indra&rsquo;s basic character as a rain god As a atter of fact, that point can be raised, with equal relevance, alost all paturalistic interpretations of the Indra mythology more or less detailed reference will have to be made, in a sub quent part of this paper, to the human character of Indra as resented in certain passages of the Veda A careful study of ich passages would at once convince one that they cannot have -en the result of the humanization of an originally naturalistic

HILLEBRANDT has interpreted the lodra Vitra war in quite different light &ndash; though, again, mainly from the naturalistic sint of view 25 He had originally adopted the popular VICW 11t Indra was the rain god of the Vedic pantheon Later on, owever, on a closer examination of the litcrature (both Vedic ad post Vedic) and ritual relating to Indra he found it neces ary to revise his vicws more or less radically As indicated Isewhere, he starts by critically studying the words and idioms, Ich as api+dha, badh, erdh, ir, etc, which are frequently used

in the descriptions of the evil deeds of Vštra, from which Ind is said to have brought about deliverance These words a idioms, according to him, cannot be understood to refer, er remotely, to the phenomenon of rain Again, the pariatas adrı, asman), which also are often referred to in that conte do not signify the clouds 26 As a matter of fact, clouds 1 distinguished from the pari atas, for, it has been said that 1 wings of the pariatas were cut off and that those wings beca clouds And, why should clouds have been regarded as demoi In Indian literature, generally a cloud is hailed as the bringer rains and not condemned as the obstructor of celestial watt HILLEBRANDT has, therefore, suggested that the waters obstr. ed by Vrtra are not the celestial rain waters, but that they : actually the streams of earthly rivers According to bim development of the Vedic mythology is not necessarly restric to the geographical limits of India He further points that, so far as the Indra Vstra legend is concerned, there sufficient ground to assume that, in its original form, ! legend was not indigenous to India but that it was carried the Vedic people from outside India to their new home. ? season, in which Vrtra is described as lying on the mounta cannot be the summer in that season, the waters are not loc up, on the other hand, the rivers are in spate as the result of melting of the glaciers in the North Western mountains
In the opinion of HILLEBRANDT, Vrtra is the winter dem who locks up the flow of the river-streams At the advent of spring, Indra, that is to say, the sun god, overpowers Vstra, winter demon, and releases the waters It is the winter not cloud &ndash; which is universally regarded as the obstructor waters 27 In the winter, the streams in the North-Western res dwindle away But, as the mountain snows melt on the api ach of the Indian summer followed by the rainy season,

waters rise and overflow the surrounding country 29 In support of his theory that lodra was primarily the sun god, who con quered the winter-demon, Vetra, and thereby released the locked. up waters, HILLEBRANDT has tried to adduce much evidence In the frequent allusions to Vrtra, as śayāna (sleeping), he finds a suggestion of the winter representing the &ldquo;sleep of nature' In the Atharvaseda ( HIT 10 12), Ekastala that is, the new year&rsquo;s night, is said to be the mother of lodra, thus implying that Indra is the symbol of the advent of the new year, that is, of the spring One of the demons, bulled by Indra, is called Rauhoa This may be but one of the many names by which Vįtra is referred to in the Veda HILLEBRANDT interprets Rauhina as the moon and confirms the identification of Vitra with the winter by pointing out that the moon is the lord of the winter Coming to the Vedic ritual, HILLEBRANDT emphasizes the facts that the mid day oblation ( madhjahna savana) is normally offered to Indra (be cause he is the sun god )29 and that Indra is associated with

A careful examination of the cvidence adduced by the spon sors of the rain god theory and the sun-god theory 10 support of their respective theories, would seem to show that these theories cancel each other Broadly speaking, most of the objections raised againt the first naturalistic interpretation of the Indra mythology, which has been discussed above, can, with cqual vall. dity, be raised against this second naturalistic interpretation as well It may be pointed out, for instance, that Vara&rsquo;s counter part in the Alesta does not signify the water demon even remo. tcly Wlat, again, is the vajra of the sun god ?% ff lodra was

originally a sun-god belonging, as HILLEBRANDT suggests, parti cularly to the pre Iadian Vedic mythology, no satisfactory explana tion could be given as to why he should have been condemned to the position of a demon in the ancient Iranian mythology Further, there was already, in the Vedic pantheon, one sun god, namely, Surya What could have been the specific reasons for introducing a new sun god? As a matter of fact, Indra and the sun are often mentioned side by side thus indicating their distinct personalities (1 32 4, 51.4, II 12 7. III 31 15, VI 17 3, 21 3, VIII 12 30, X 171 4 Again, the elevation of a solar divinity to the supreme position in the Vedic pantheon cannot be adequately accounted for
The descriptions, in the RV, of the Indra-Vrtra battle are such as produce the impression that that battle had been parti cularly violent and fearful (1 80 11, II 11 9-10, VI 17 9) In overpowering Vrtra, bus vanquisher, Indra, had to perform enormously terrific feats (I 32 5,57 6, 80 14) Such descrip tions would appear quite incongruous when related to the springe time sud At the advent of the spring, the sun appears as a particularly life giving ard energising power rather than as a fear ful giant Further, it is to be seriously doubted whether the phenomenon of the dwindling away of rivers in the winter, even in the regions mentioned by HILLEBRANDT, was actually so very common and significant in the life of the Vedic people as to be made the central iheme of the mythology relatiog to their greatest god The idea of glaciers, etc, which are supposed to be lock ing up the waters of the rivers, is nowhere unequivocally present cd in the RV HILLEBRANDTS suggestions that Rauhina, as the moon, is the lord of the winter and thus represents the winter demon killed by Indra, and that the references to sayāna Vrtra may poetically signifv the sleed of nature (that is, the winter)

were to be accepted, Indra should have been connected with the sasanta rather than the grisma Other features of the Indra mythology, particularly Indra&rsquo;s close association with the Maruts and his proverbial fondness for the intoxicating beverage, would not fit in well with the sun god theory The human elements in Indra&rsquo;s character are, as indicated above, too vital and realistic to be regarded merely as the result of anthropomorphic tenden cies It is, therefore, difficult to accept HILLEBRANDT&rsquo;s theory that Indra originally represented the sun god 97 As a matter of fact, that scholar himself could not altogether overlook the fact that the elements relating to the phenomenon of rain are suffi clently prominent in Indra&rsquo;s personality He, therefore, conclu

Several other variations of the solar theory have been proposed by scholars Mas MOLLER, for instance, sees in the Indra Vstra myth the symbolical description of the daily triumph of light over darkness (Contri bution to the Same of Afythology I, pp 141-42) It may be recalled that he has identified Indra also with Jupiter Pluvus ( Lectures on the Sacter of Language 11, 470) Hc bclicvcs that ytra primarily the demon of darkness and that the vascularing of poctic imagery between dark night and dark cloud would be quite in keeping with the Vedic myth making BG TILAK
(Arche Home, 233 ff ), who propounded the theory that the Vedic mythology, 23 a whole, can be best understood only by relating it to the natural phenomena observable in the Arctic region saw in Indra the sun-god who overpowered the demon of darkness who dominated that region continuously for some months, VA GADCIL suggests (ABORI XXIII, pp 134 ff that Indra and Varuna represent the two aspects of the central Vedic concept of pla Varuna, according to hin the representative of the passivc moral Principle while Indra is the representative of the highest physical aspect of nature GADCU. further zuggests that the concept underlying the Indra Vpra myth the eternal conflict between leas and tamas It may be pointed out that GADCIL a interpretation, besides not being supported by Vedic evidence is far too abstract It is indecd, doubtful whether Vedic poets ever made a clear cut istinction between the physical and the non physical aspects of nature More or less the same thing can he said about the theory of FATEH SINGH (JBHU 5), who sees in Indra the deity of universal light and energy He interprets the myth of Indra s birth through the side of bus mother as representing the first light of dawa wh ch is visible in a circular way R Sram SASTRI (DC Law Vol 1, 227-281) conoccts the Vedic mythology with astronomical bodies and phenomena According to him, Indra 15 the sun fighting with the eclipse demon Sambara he explains Thomas Comm l&rsquo;ol, 257-61), is an eclipse-demon of the type of Rahu and

ded that Indra was originally the sun, but, in the RV, is no longer the sun god, while not yet a rain god 53 For, as he points out, the six passages in the RV, which unequivocally refer to Indra as the giver of rains, occur in the fourth, the eighth, and the tenth mandalas, which fact would indicate, according to him, that the character of Indra as a rain god was still not established in the Rgvedic times HILLEBRANDT, however, does not seem to have taken into account the fact that several descriptions of the Indra Vitra fight in the RV, 31 though not necessarily indicative of Indra&rsquo;s essential character as rain god, do indirectly imply the phenomenon of storm and rain Those descriptions may not and, as shown above, do not prove that Indra was primarily a rain god But they do certainly indicate that, among the naturalistic elements superimposed on Indra&rsquo;s original character, those normally connected with a rain god are more prominent
The foregoing discussion of the two principal naturalistic interpretations of the Indra mythology will have made it amply clear that the naturalistic or cosmic elements could not have been either the basic or the primary elements in Indra&rsquo;s character

on the original personality of that god Our aim will, therefore, be, firstly, to find out what the original character of Indra must have been, and, secondly, to describe and rationally account for the circumstances under which the cosmic elements must have been superimposed on his personality 3*
One thing which would strike even a casual student of the Todra-mythology is the fact that in no other god of the Vedic pantheon are the features of human appearance (akrt) and

36 Some other theorics regarding the basic character and personality of Indra baic also been put forth by scholars HOPKNS, for instance, believes that Indra was originally a god of fertility (JAOS 36, pp 242 ff) In support of his theory, that scholar has adduced evidence from the cpic, post-Vedic, and Vedic sources In the epics, Indra i called pakafasona (= crop controller ?), and the festival of Indra u always associated with harvest and fortuity rather than with victory Io the PfraskaraGS (II 17 9), Indra&rsquo;s wife is said to be Sit, that is personificd furrow Indra figures as the foremost among the gods worshipped at the ceremony of first starting the ploughs (Cf Gobhilas IV 4 28 ) In AV IV 4 4, Iodra 1 said to be responsible for putting vinlity in the o adhus Indra is described in the RP 25 utvarHart, he wins the tilth, is lord of tilth, as he 11 lord of cattle (11 21 6, VI 601, VII 21 3) Such references, according to HIOPKINS, indicate that Indra was first celebrated as a demon of fertility He was then accepted as the chief war god among two or three clans (HOPKNS bas clscwhere - JAOS 37, 83 ff - tried to show that the combination of gods of war and fertility 1not uncommon) From war god he was later on elevated to be the greatest god of the large group of clans Without cxamining, in detai, the vicws of HQFAINS, we may only point out that several of thic objections raised against the rain god thcory or the sun god theory can be raised, with cqual appositeness, against the fertility-god theory as well The references to thu aspect of Indra&rsquo;s character arc clearly secondary and incidental. It is not unlikely that tlac hinu regarding the power of fertility possessed by Indra are duc to the combination of the elements of the rain-god and the sun god, which were superimposed on his personality Its well known that the sun and the rain together on use fertility
One great drawback of the naturalistic and simular other interpretations Is that their sponsors stm to view Vedic mythology as if it were a static phcaatacnon They forget that, in consonance with the various 17c1iSitudes In the Vedic way of life and thought, there must have been revitably elected ngalfcant modifications in the Vedic mythology as well Therefort, lo emphauzt only one aspect of the personality of a cdc god without taking into account the other aspects and thereby try to determine the basic character of thrt god u bound to prove a faulry procedure It would lead but to a partnl picture of the personality of that god

character (prakrti) so conspicuously prominent as in Indra A closer examination of the descriptions of Indra&rsquo;s person and character would further convince one that so plastic a figure as his and so essentially human a behaviour as is attributed to him cannot be considered to have been the result of more anthropo morphism It may be pointed out that, as against the vague and indefinite naturalistic elements, the human features in Indra&rsquo;s personality are so realistic and life like that one feels iaclined unhesitatingly to accept the latter as more basic and essential Indra&rsquo;s body, bead, arms, and hands are very often referred to (11 162, VIII 963) He is said to be golden in colour (1 72, VIII 66 3) His body is gigantic, his neck mighty, and his back brawny His arms are sleek, and his hands thick and firm — both right and left being particularly well shaped (I 1026, IV 219, VI 193, VIII 81 1) He has hardsome cheeks (or lips ), and is, therefore often called susipra (II 126, 335), Siprin 29 2, III 36 10), or sipraian ( VI 17 2) He is tawny haired (X 96 5,8) and tawny bearded (X 234) These and several other similar descriptions of Indra s person unmistakably produce before our minds eye a very life lıke picture of a tall, strong, well formed, handsome, blonde Aryan Far more life lıke, how eyer, are the descriptions of some peculiar physical mannerisms of that god He agitates his jaws (VIII 76 10 ), or puffs out his beautiful lips (III 321) ip a characteristic fashion, in an cipation of or after the Soma draught Once he is described very realistically, indeed &ndash; as shaking off the drops of Soma from his moustaches (11 11 17) There are references to another peculiar movement of the upper lip, and to the shaking of the beard (X 231, 26 7) Such characteristic physical traits and mapnerisms must necessarily be distinguished from the very general human traits attributed to a god as the result of the normal anthropomorphic tendencies Indra&rsquo;s appearance and mannerisms are so very distinctively individual that they seem to have been derived from a specific human person
Another peculiarity which clearly distinguishes Indra from the other major gods of the Veda, is the fact that he is frequently

referred to as having been born Two entire hymns, namely, III 48 and IV 18, deal with the subject of his birth In one of these hymns. Indra is said to have been born in an unnatural way, that is, through the side of his mother (IV 18 1-2) A special reference to such an unusual phenomenon would become meaning Jess unless there had been in vogue, among the people, some such traditional belief relating to the birth of an actual human hero As is scll known, such miraculous birth is always associated, 10 the popular mind, with a great and unique person 37 It is further not unlikely that the reference to Indra&rsquo;s having killed his father in order to snatch away Soma from him and having thus made his own mother a widow (III 48 4, IV 18 12) is the result of popular myth making based on an ordinary historical fact such as that Indra&rsquo;s father dicd suddenly soon after his birth 38 Indra&rsquo;s miraculous power is said to have become evident as soon as he was born (111 518, Y 30 5, VIII 45 4, 771, X 113 4) In X 1531, there is a reference to the infant god surrounded by atten dant women Apother interesting reference is to be found in VIII 69 15, where the immature boy, Indra, of head strong temperament, is spoken of as having mounted a new wagon, and roasted, for his parents, a fierce bull All these descrip

tions point unmistakably to the basic human character of Indra&rsquo;s personality
A reference has already been made elsewhere to the tradı tional belief that Indra is a later addition to the Vedic pantheon This very significant tradition cannot be adequately explained except on the assumption of Indra&rsquo;s primarily human personality It implies that Indra was not originally a god, but that he was a human hero who attained godhead by virtue of his miraculous exploits Not only that, but he soon superseded the older gods (VII 21 7) and came to be regarded as the foremost among them (II 121) This fact is mythologically represented in a variety of ways in the later Vedic literature ( TS II 342, MSI 94,
TB II 233, 277, AB VIII 4 12)
But by far the most convincing proof of the essentially human character of Indra is the fact that the Vedic poets have often referred to what may be called the weaknesses' of that god One such oft-mentioned weakness is Indra&rsquo;s proverbial fondness for Soma Hıs immoderate indulgence in the intoxicating beverage is a favourite theme of the Vedic poets Indra is spoken of as having gone to the extent of stealing Soma to quench his thirst (III 48 4, VIII 44) He was somapa par excellence But his was not merely an addict&rsquo;s passion for drink For Soma always exhilarated him to carry out his warlıke deeds (II 151, 192, VI 47 1-2, VII 222, VIII 926) For, instance, in order to prepare himself for a decisive war with Vrtra, Indra is described of course, hyperbolically to have drunk three tankfuls of Soma (V 29 7) But the most significant sukta, which must needs be mentioned in the present context, is X 119 39 In this sūkla, Indra is represented as being under the influence of an excessive draught of Soma and consequently boasting of his greatness and capricious power As PERRY has rightly pointed out, Indra&rsquo;s condition after a drink of Soma parodied in this suhta is too realistic not to be considered human It is a fine example of

caricature and would remind one of modern newspaper caricatures - either in the form of humorous articles or of cartoons in which innocent fun is made of some foible in tlic character of a great personage No disrespect is, however, thereby intended On the other hand, by light-heartedly poking at such a foible, that high personality is brought neater to the hearts of the people, for, it, indeed, emphasizes his essential humapness As a matter of fact, it is believed that such harmless foibles enhance, rather than detract from, the genuine greatness of that person Ipdra, the human hero, must have been in the habit of indulging in a more or less sumptuous draught of Soma in order to invigorate himself before entering battle This well known habit of his seems to have been made the subject of a delightful parody in the Laba suhta
Similarly Indra is represented as an expert in female lore (VIII 33 17) He seems to have taken a peculiar interest in the welfare of the children of uomarried girls (IL IS 7) As a domestic aider and as particularly interested in girls not yet married, he appers in the form of the little man' iqvoked by Apālā (VIII 91 ), who chews Soma plant and prepares grain for him that he may make her friutful&rdquo; In AV (VIII 6 13), Indra is said to come to the help of a pregnant woman Though Indra&rsquo;s amorous adventures are nowhere clearly mentioned in the RI, there are, in it, a few faint jedications of that trait of his character These latter must have, indeed, been the basis of Indra&rsquo;s representation, in later mythology, as a romantic figure a &lsquo;gay Lothario&rsquo;&rdquo;? In the Athari aleda, Indra is once said to have been enticed away by an Asura female ( VII 38 2) In another Vedic passage, we are told that Indra, being enamoured of a danari, named Valistenga, went to live among the Asuras, assuming the form of a female among females and of a male among males A mention must also be made, in this context,

of the famous Vrsākapı hymn (X86) In that hymn, Indra 18 spoken of as having been exhausted when a bold, lascivious monkey administered to him some medicine, through which Indra regained his manly power As shown in another paper,&rdquo; this Vrsākapı is to be identified with the fertility-god Visnu
The whole episode may thus refer to Indra&rsquo;s efforts to preserve his virility intact 45 Such descriptions of a more or less intimate' character must be understood to refer to the actual life of a human hero before he became the supreme god
It may be pointed out, in this connection, that the Vedic poets have never unnecessarily overidealised the character of Indra, which they would have done had he been primarily thought of as a god Indra was essentially a man of this world, and, as such, he did not disdain deceiving his enemy or cleverly circumscribing the conditions of an agreement whenever circumstances so de manded 46 Another very significant reference, so far as Indra&rsquo;s original character is concerned, is to be found in 1 32 14, where the mighty Indra is said to bave been overcome with fear when, after killing Vrtra, he thought that some avenger of the enemy was following him Such a reference would be hardly understandable in relation to a god, who had been conceived as a god from the very beginning

harmonious relations between the heroic leader and his loyal followers seem to have been disturbed on certain occasions (I. 170 2, 171 6, VIII 7 31 ) It must have been either cowardice or treachery on the part of the Maruts, which had estranged them from Indra Indra is represented as telling them, in derision, that they were not eager to accompany him when he went to the battle field, but that, when he was zovited to a sacrifice, they did not want to leave him alone (I 165 ) This realistic legend relating to the temporary estrangement between Indra and the Maruts must have been based on an actual episode, and would thus prove the historicity of Indra as much as bis essentially human character The facts that Indra is described as wandering in various forms (IIC 48 4, 53 8, VI 47 18 ), 48 and that his ene mies did not first realise the greatness of his prowess or altogether refused to believe in his very existence (II 12 5) further confirm the primariness of the human traits in Indra&rsquo;s personality as well as his historicity
More prominently and frequently, however, than the mere human traits have the heroic traits in Indra&rsquo;s personality been celebrated in the RV fodra&rsquo;s name itself verily comprises all notions relating to virile power 9 He is often very significantly called, or compared with, a bull, who was regarded as the symbol of such power (1 165 11, II 16 4, V 31 5, VIII 1 1) Indra is superhumanly mighty (I 80 15, VI 21 10, VII 21 7, VIII 50 2), he is dreadful (1 84 2,7, II 21 2), he is, indeed, 10. vincible (IV 17 19,30 3,5) No one born, past or present, can rival him (I 165 9) Several epithets expressive of excessive power, such as Sakra, sacivat, Satakratu, manasıān, etc, are

frequently attributed to Indra Indra&rsquo;s susma and nrmna (IT 12 1) are often referred to and his eternal youth and vigour (II 16 1, III 32 7, VI 24 7, X 86 11 ) have become almost the ballmark of his personality But there is also another side to Indra&rsquo;s heroic character He is exceedingly generous (I 84 19, IV 31 7, VIII 14 4,24 21, 81 3) He freely bestows goods and wealth on the pious man (II 194, 22 3. VII 27 3), and this he can easily do, for, he possesses all treasures (I 30 10, VI 43 8 As a matter of fact, Indra&rsquo;s liberality had become so yery characteristic of him that he almost entirely monopolised the proud epithet maghavan 50 Indra&rsquo;s wisdom and prudence also are frequently celebrated in the RV (1 62 12, II 16 2, VIII 96 3)
It will be thus seen that Indra&rsquo;s personality presents a curious combination of human and superhuman' or heroic' ele ments As a matter of fact it is this combination of the “human and the superhuman', which makes Indra&rsquo;s personality so
• living' and so attractive The incongruity between the human aspect of Indra s personality characterised by sansuousness and similar other normal weaknesses, on the one hand, and tric superhuman aspect characterised by miraculous powers, genero sity, and similar other traits of beroic perfection on the other, is not due to the more intense anthropomorphism of Indra&rsquo;s nature 51 It is rather the result of the sincere efforts on the part of the Vedic poets to present a realistic picture of a historical human hero, who while accomplishing almost superhuman deeds, suli exbibited the essential humanness of his character in the light of what has been said above, it would be very interesting to see how the Vedic poets approach their favourite national god Jodra, in varying attitudes — sometimes in a &lsquo;crouching, pusil lazımous spirit and fear of his violence&rsquo;, at other times, on remarkably intimate and friendly terms, but always exhibitios great devotion and fidelity towards him, a firm belief in his mita culous powers and a &lsquo;touching reliance upon his goodness!

On the strength of tlie evidence adduced so far, we may dow be justified in concluding that Indra must have been primarily a human bero - indeed, essentially a historical personality &ndash; that, in course of time, he must have been elevated to the position first of the national war god and then of the supreme god and that, later on, naturalistic or cosmic elements must have been superim posed on his personality 53 How can we account for this growth of Indra&rsquo;s personality? In order to be able to answer this question satisfactorily, we shall have to go back to the cultural history of the ancestors of the Vedic Indians
As indicated in another paper, we may assume on the strength of linguistic, archaeological, anthropological, and culture historical evidence, that the proto Indo Europeans had their Ofiginal home in the Ural - Altaic region Some tribes from among this proto IE stock migrated from their primary Urheimar towards the South Eastern direction and ultimately reached the Iegion around Balkh There they lived for a considerable length of time before further migrations started from among theo? As a matter of fact, these tribes remained in the region round about Balkh so long that they almost forgot their connections with their primary Urheimat For our present purpose it is neither neces sary nor relevant to go into the details of this whole problem of the original home of the Indo Europeans and their early migra trons It may only be pointed out that these people, who lived in the region of Balkh were the proto Aryans in the initial stages of the proto Aryan period, there took place some stray and desultory migrations mainly towards the South Western Asiatic region But even after these small scale migrations, the

main stock of the proto-Aryans, which was made up of the common ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient (Avestad) Iranians &ndash; who are popularly, and, from several points of view. appropriately, known as the Aryans &ndash; continued to live in the Balkh region for a pretty long time
It was, indeed, in this region that the &lsquo;Aryan&rsquo; language and religion attained characterisation&rsquo; In other words, the common primary form of the languages and the religions of the RV and of the Avesta must have evolved wbile the common ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians lived together in their common home in the Balkh region The most characteristic fea. ture of the religion of these people, which we may call the *Aryan&rsquo; religion, seems to have been the concept of Asura Varuna 56 In the course of the evolution of their religious thought, the Aryans had realised that this universe, vast as it was, was not &lsquo;chaos&rsquo; Every single phenomenon &ndash; big and small - in cosmic as well as human life was governed by some definite law The universe was, as it were, magically bound' down and thus strictly regulated It was, in other words, cosmos' The concepts of the cosmic law, rta, and of the administrator of that law, the cosmic magician Varuna, represent the most outstanding contribution of the Aryans to religious thought in general that age, the life of the Aryans had been so closely bound with nature, from several points of view, that it was but inevitable that they should have evolved the religious concept of the cosmic magic bondage No doubt, there must have grown, among the Aryans, several other religious concepts and practices, such as lof instance, those connected with Soma Haoma and fire, but the Asura Ria-concept seems to have completely dominated the Aryab religious ideology
As has been already indicated, the Aryans did not live in the region around Balkh permanently Further migrations started from that region As compared with the major primary migru.

tions of the Indo-Europeans from their Urheimat in the Ural Altaic region, the migrations of the Aryans from the Balkh region may be called the secondary migrations in the history of the Todo European pcoplcs Some tribes from among the Aryans who were of a peace loving temperament moved towards the South West Gradually, and without having to encounter any serious hindrance, they migrated to the north of Iran and subsequently settled in that country These were the ancient Iranians As may be expected, they had brought with them, to their new home, the Aryan language and religion in their basic forms Naturally enough, in course of time, the ancient Iranians must have deve loped the basic Aryan language and religion in their own peculiar manner The other Aryan tribes, however, were more ambitious and warlıke From their home in the Balkh region these adven turers set out on a mission of conquest and colonization towards the South-East Tbis, however, was not an easy task On their odward march these people, who were really the ancestors of the Vedıç Indians, had to encounter serious opposition from several antagonistic tribes Their gradual progress towards Saptasındhu, where they ultimately settled down, makes a long tale of a series of wars But through all these wars, the early Vedic people were finally led to victory by a heroic compatriot of theirs, whom they very appropriately called Indra
It may be presumed that the tribes who tried to arrest the onslaught of the Vedic Indians came from various stocks From the descriptions in the Ry, it would appear that they were racially and culturally quite different from the Vedic Aryan adventurers They are generally said to have been black skinned (I 130 8, II 20 7 ) and snub posed (V 29 10) Their speech was barbarous (T 174 2, V 29 10, 32 8), they did not perform any sacrifices as the Aryans did (I 33 4, VII 6 3, VII 70 11), they did not worship the Aryan gods (II 31 19, VIII 70 11), and, above all, they did not recognise the national hero of the Vedic Indians, namely, Indra (IV 23 7, VI 18 16, also cf II 12 5)

IV 24 3) For, they looked upon him as their one compassionate helper (184 19, VUI 66 13, 801), as their deliverer and advocate (VIII 96 20 ), as their very stroogth - &amp; veritable wall of defence (VIII 69 7) Never rodeed did he fail them (X. 152 1) With his special thousand pronged weapon, vajra (1. 80 12), he smote down the barbarous enemies (I 101 5, VI 23 2), and gave land to the Aryans (IV 26 2, VII, 33 5) He thus ensured for them a smooth career of conquest and coloni. zation It is, therefore, no wonder that such a leader should have soon become a national hero and then a national god of the Vedic Indians 62 A warring people would naturally glorify to the utmost a warlike god 63 This heroic god of battle, though a later addition to the Vedic pantheon, soon surpassed all earlier gods ( 11 12 1, 111 46 3), who yielded to him in might and strength (VIII 62 7) Even, the important older gods subordt.

nated their power to Indra&rsquo;s divine glory and kingly dignity (VII 21 7) This elevation of a national hero to the supreme godhead must be assumed to have belonged to a period subsequent to the bifurcation of the Iranian Aryans and the Indian Aryans Such an assumption alone would rationally explain why Indra is traditionally regarded as derānam ānujävara, and why this supreme god of the Vedic Indians does not find place in the Avestan pantheon
Such then is briefly the story of the genesis of Indra&rsquo;s godhead One thing, however, must be necessarily emphasized in this connection It will be casily realised that all the warlike exploits, which, in the RV, are attributed to Indra, could not have been accomplished by one single individual The credit for many of them must certainly be given to the historical hero
But when history becomes mythology, an individual also tends to be more or less tumed into an institution Such is normally the course of mythological development particularly in the Veda When, therefore the historical Indra was transformed into a national war god, all mighty deeds of prowess &mdash;real or imaginary - came to be regarded as his handiwork It may also be pointed out, in this context, that the warriors of the Vedic age soyoked Indra for help not only in their battles with the Dāsas and other inimical tribes There was a period in the history of the Vedic people when different Vedic tribes fought among them. selves In such civil wars, both sides invoked Indra for help (11 12 8) Indra is, therefore, often described, in the RV, as the valiant vanquisher of the Dasa foes as well as of the Arya foes (VI 22 10, 33 3,60 6, VII, 83 1, X 69 6) This fact would again confirm Indra&rsquo;s essential character as a war-god
This elevation of a historical hero to the position of the national war.god of the Vedic Indians was accompanied by the superimposition on the original character of Indra of certain features which were derived from a significant mythological concept belonging to the common Aryan period it has already been pointed out that the most predominant religious concept, which was evolved during the Aryan period, was that of Asura

It is difficult to accept the idenus fication of the VF ras with any specific people Vytan indicates foes in general.
71 That the concept of Vithragua is specifically Aryan, and, therclore, carlier than that of Indra, which is specifically Indian, is confirmed by the fact that the word arthragna, occurs in the earlier strata of the Acesta, such as the Strozah the Yasts, and the Afrigans, while the word, andra, represent. ing the demonisation of the Vedic god, Indra occurs only in the later strata, as also by the fact that, in the Avesta, the concept of Vithragna receives a more or less detailed treatment, while that of Andra occurs only in a casual manner As a matter of fact, the name Andra occurs, in the Adesta, only twice (Vid X. 9, VIX 43)

Indian historical current and an ancient Aryan mythological current thus combined to form the later Vedic mythological concept of Vitrahā Jodra As against this, among the peaceable Ancient Iranians, there was no scope for such historical concretisa tion of the concepts of Vrtra - Vrtrahan Those concepts have, thereforc, conserved their original abstract sease in the Avesta 72 It must be pointed out, in this connection, that, even in the RV, the frequent occurrence of the neuter plural, vitrānı (VI 22 10, 60 6, VII 83 1 ), betrays the original impersonal and abstract connotation of the word
The history of the concept of Vţtra is closely linked up with the course of the evolution of the lodra mythology as a whole Originally the word, vrira, significantly used in neuter gender, expressed the general idea of resistance. It was in no way connected with the concept of Indra, which, as a matter of fact, had not then even arisen This was the state of thupgs 10 the common Aryan period When the histor cal hero, Indra, came to be glorified among the Vedic Indians, they personified the impersonal concept of Vitra, which they had inherited from their Aryan ancestors Vftras then came to denote the human foes, whom Indra, the national hero of the Vedic Indians, valantly put down Soon Indra, the national hero, was defied by the Vedic poets Corresponding to this deification of the human Indra, there took place the demonisation of the human Vrtra At this later stage of the Rgvedic mythology, the hustorical human Vytras were collectively transformed into the one &lsquo;demon&rsquo;, who prominently opposed Indra, the great god And still later, when Daturalistic elements came to be superimposed upon Indra&rsquo;s ongina personality as the result of which Indra came to be
72 It would not be logical to suppose that the Vedic Vetrahy Indm was the original concept and that it was reparated into two independent concepts in the Avestan mythology Tor, as Kemit ponts out (ICI 41 if ). 11 15 more natural for India to unite ideas than for Iran to separate them Vorc oitt, it would not by adequately understandable why, if the Iranians had actually sparate into two the concept of straha Indra iheep the namely,

regarded as the rain god, there was a corresponding naturalistic transformation of Vrtra&rsquo;s personality so that he came to be looked upon as the cloud demon 73 It will now become perfectly clear why, in the Avestan mythology, there is a divin ty, Vrthragna but no demon, Vrthra, why the Avestan Vrthragna and Andra are in no way connected with each other, why, in the RV, Vrtahan lost his character as an independent divinity and that word became merely an epithet of Indra, and, finally, why in the RV, the word Vrtra, 18 employed, 10 neturer plural, to denote the human foes, and, in masculine singular, to denote a demon
It has been already pointed out that the origin of the religious practices connected with Soma Haoma must be traced back to the common Aryan period The ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians, who lived together in the Balkh region, must have soon discovered the remarkable properties of the Soma plant, which grew in abundance on the slopes of the Müjavat mountain situated close to their common habitat The intoxi cating juice extracted from this plant must have been originally used in connection with some primitive magic ritual Anthropo logical investigations would amply testify to the practice of the primitive priests taking some such intoxicating decoction with view to producing in themselves a peculiar magic orgiastic ecs tacy 74 With the rise, among the Vedic Indups, of the valiant hero, Indra, Soma drinking came to be naturally associated w him It may be said that, in a sense, the intoxicating drink began to be used for a purpose which cannot be said to have been strictly ritualistic A draught of Soma, before entering battle, would banish all fear from the hearts of the warriors and put new vigour in them This must have, indeed, been a most common experience 75 It is quite understandable that Iadra, the tvartior

leader, should have been described as indulging in the Soma drinking more freely than others As a matter of fact, in course of time, immoderate indulgence in the Soma-drinking came to be regarded as a distinctive trait of Indra&rsquo;s character - at once the strength and the weakness of the national hero And, as shown elsewhere, the Vedic poets have actually treated it as such in their glorification of Indra Indra became somapā par excellence (II 12 13 ) He is often described, in the RV, as getting exhilarated by a drink of Soma for carrying out his warlıke deeds (II 15 1; 19 2, VI 47 1, 2, VII 222, VIII 92 6) Whatever Indra accomplished he owed to the magic power of Soma Sometimes however, the Herculean head of the hero must have become befogged by an overdose, and it is such a condition which has been beautifully caricatured by a Rgvedic poet an X 119 The Vedic poets rcfcr to Indra as a thirsty stag' (VII 4 10), or a &lsquo;thirsty bull&rsquo; (1 130 2), or a thirsty buffalo' (I 16 5) Indra is so eager for a drink that he cannot wait until Soma is drawn for hım (X 116 4), but &lsquo;guips down cask and lancet and all ***
The concert relating to Soma is thus the second Aryan religi ous concept - the first being the Vitra-Vitrahan concept - which has been combined with the Vedic Indian historical concept of the national hero The more or less secular significance with which the concept of Soma came to be endowed on account of its connection with the historical warrior, Indra, must, however, be considered to have been but a temporary phase With the clcyalion of Indra to godhead and the gradual development of the regular Vedic ritual, Soma again attained, in the fullest possible measurc, its original migico-ritualistic significance (which, as indicated above, it must have never lost altogether). and Soma worship became a cry prominent feature of the Vedic religion 3

In view of the continued warlike activities of the Vedic Indians, it was but natural that they should have elevated their national war god, Indra, to the supreme godhead in their pan theon This action on their part gave rise to quite a serious mythological upheaval It will be remembered that Asura Varuna was the supreme god of the common religion which the ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians had evolved This Asura dominated religion was inherited both by the Indian Aryans and the Iranian Aryans The Iranian Aryans seem to have faithfully stuck to that religion As a matter of fact, 10 the normal life of those people, there does not seem to have occurred any very significant event, which could have influ enced their religious ideology to any appreciable extent of course, in course of time, they developed the Asura-religion of their Aryan ancestors in their own peculiar manner, so that it eventually took the form of the religion presided over by Ahura Mazdah The case of the Vedic Indians, on the other hand, was essentially different As has been already pointed out the Vedic Indians were ambitious adventurers They, therefore, set out on a career of warlıke activities, valiantly fighting their way towards the Saptasındhu country in this their new career, they must have found that the cosmic magic Asura religion, which had come down to them from their Aryan ancestors was not at all adequate Awarring people, as suggested above necessarily wants a war god - rather than a god presiding over cosmic law - as their supreme god &lsquo;The Vedic Indians, therefore, transe formed their national hero, Indra into such a war god, and 14 consonance with their new way of life and thought, worshipped him as their greatest god Thus, in the religion of the Vedic Indiaos, Indra ultimately superseded Asura Varuna In other words, the new Vedic religion prevailed over the ancient Aryan religion

A critical study of the RV would show that, in that Veda, three distinct pbases of the relation between the ancient Yaruna religion and the new Indra religion can be clearly marked Some passages in the RV (I 24 6,25 10, IT 27 10, VII 87 5,6, VIII 41 7, X 132 4) are still found to glorify Varuna as the world soyercigo They thus seem to preserve the memories of the religious ideology of the pre Indra Aryan period This represents one phase The major portion of the RV, however, clearly indi cates that Varuna religion was being pushed into the background and the Indra religion was aggressively coming to the forefront The RV-hymn, IV 42, is a highly significant document in this connectic Varuna is shown in that hymn to assert his right to supremacy and to adduce valid reasons in support of his claim (st 1-4) Indra is made to say that Varuna&rsquo;s arguments did not concern him in the least and that, in virtue of his being the strongest god, he - Indra – must necessarily be regarded as the supreme god (st 5-6) Eventually the poet recognises unreser vedly the supremacy of Indra (st 7) This hymn thus represents, in an unmistakable manner, the supersession of Varuna by Indra 8 According to PERRY,79 another hymn, pamely, RVX 124, exhibits the transference of supremacy from Varuna to ladra in a very peculiar light Agdi is there represented as abandoning father Varuna and going over to Indra The fact that hardly a dozen hymns in the RV celebrate Varuna exclusively wbile Indra is glorified in nearly 250 hymns is again clearly indicative of Indra&rsquo;s ascendancy over Varunia 80 As will be shown later, this mytho

logical supersession of the Asura by Indra, which represents another phase of the Indra-Varuna relationship, gained a peculiar significance from two points of view &ndash; first, from the point of viety of the relations between the Vedic religion and the Iranian religion, and, secondly, from the point of view of the political history of the Vedic Indians Still another phase of the relationship between these two mythological currents 15 marked by a spirit of compromise. It must be remembered that, even among the Vedic Indians, there were some groups who continued to adhere to the Varuna-religion They must have, however, seen the signs of the changing times Instead of either giving up the Varuna religion altogether or dogmatically sticking to it in the face of the generally prevailing Indra-religion, they, very wisely, tried to bring about an honourable compromise between the two religions They argued that, after victory is won by the war-god, Indra, Varuna is needed to establish law and order
Indra conquers and Varuna rules this was their slogu (VII 83 9) Such attempts at a religious compromise seem to have been made particularly by the Vasisthas (VII 82 2,»,, 84 2, 4, 85 3) $1

There were some other currents which were, in course of time, merged into the mythology relating to that god One of the most natural consequences of the elevation of a human hero to the position of a god - particularly to the position of the supreme god of the pantheon, as in the case of Indra – was to make him responsible for some mighty cosmic deeds As a matter of fact, it is the association with such cosmic deeds that truly establishes the god head of a god This is, indeed, one of the ways in which history

100 In hư book, The Hero (A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama ), London, 1919, Lord RAGLAN has made some thought proroking observations on the subject of Hero in mythology and history' Without attempting a delalled cxamdauon of RAGLANS observations it may be pointed out that those observations, though very suggestive, appear to be clearly oncsided According to RAOLAN, there is no justification for believiog that mytho logical heroes were originally historical persons or that any of the stories of their cxploits had any bustoncal foundation He says that the world of tradition is quite a different one from that of h.story He further points out that the stories of heroes in scveral mythologics in the world follow a specific pattern, wbich is characterised by 22 points (Pp 178-79), and that thu pattcn strongly suggests ritual pattern rather than a hustoncally Authenuc account Out of these 22 points at the most four points can be found in the story of the Vedic Indra Therefore, even accepting RAGLANS analyous of tho &lsquo;Hero&rsquo; (which is by no means either complete or entirely convincing ), thic Vedic Indra cannot be regarded merely as a traditional JCto without any hustorical character It may be pointed out, in this counc lion, that it is certainly not claimed that the entire Indra mythology is Authenue bustory, all that is claimed that there unmistakably exist, D that mythology, some historical elements L«cn RAGLAN scemos to admit (PP 148, 151 ) that mythology docs tend to rellcct, to a certain extent, political and economic conditions Snealuing of the basis of history, RAOLAN mumeratos five classes of historical materials Among these he mcludes contemporary records As suggested ciscwliere in this paper, it may be claimed that the Veda is, in a scnsc record of contemporary historical Events.

Side by side with this superimposition on Indra&rsquo;s personality of the character of a rain god, which represents the last phase in the process of the becoming' of lodra,10there occurred the merger of another mythological currrent into the Indra-mythology. A comparative study of the ancient mythologies of the world would show that most of them have one myth in common, namely, the myth relating to the contest between the hero and the dra.

gon 106 The significance of this universal myth is quite obvious It should, however, be remembered in this connection that only the general basic skeleton of this myth is adopted by the various ancient mythologies, the details put into it being different in duffe Tent cases in other words, we find the concepts of Hero' and
Dragon' in almost all ancient mythologies, but these concepts do not necessarily have the same contents everywhere 107 The ancient Aryans also adapted of course in their own peculiar manner this myth of the hero and the dragon in the general scheme of their mythological thought Iadeed, the Vedic Aryans must bave found the adaptation of this myth particularly easy In their new mythology, they had already deilied tlic historical hero, Indra The most natural thing for them to do, therefore, was to identify the hero of the ancient dragon myth with that historical hero Indra&rsquo;s principal enemies, both human and cosmic, accordingly came to be known by the name, Abi (dragon), and several new elements, derived from the apcient dragon myth, came to be introduced into the Indra mythology 10% So far as thc RV Is concerned, with the identification of Indra with the hero of the ancient dragon myth, the growth of the persopality of the Rgvedic Indra may be said to have come to an end
106 The various forms which this universal hero dragon myth has taken in different ancient mythologies are Zeus and Typlion, Hercules and the Hydra, Apollo and Python &lsquo;Thor and the Serpent Marduk and Tiamat, Gilgames and Humbuda Innara and the Dragon Thraetappa and Azı Dahata.

In order to be able to answer this question, it would be necessary to trace albeit briefly - the evolution of the Marut mythology In the Rgvedic mythology, the Maruts arc associated mainly with two gods, namely, Rudra and Indra Just as the Maruts are designa ted as indrapresthah, the followers of Indra, they are also called rudrijāh, the children of Rudra How can these two concepts be correlated with each other 7 It is neither possible nor neces sary in the present context to go into the details of this enthe problem The following hypothesis may, however, be put tonia as the only one which would satisfactorily explain the various aspects of the mythology relating to the Maruts At one stage in the evolution of the Rudra-mythology, Rudra came to be repre. sented in the RV&rsquo; as the god of death 100 and the Maruts belonged

originally to the paraphernalia of that god. Etymologically the word, marut, may be derived from the root mar (= to die ). It would seem likely that primarily the Maruts were the personifica tions of the souls of the deadlio and secondarily the messengers of the god of death. As the messengers of death, the Maruts seem to have formed a uniform, well-disciplined, homogeneous group. It has been pointed out, in another context,111 that, in the course of the development of the Vedic mythology, Rudra&rsquo;s character as god of death came to be gradually obliterated and that, soon, he came to be superseded in that role by Yama, who, incidentally, was not originally the god of death This must have inevitably resulted in the breaking up of the original connection between Rudra and the Maruts - even the few references to that connection, which have been preserved in the RV, becoming gradually less under standable. The Vedic poets then gave to the mythological concept of the Maruts quite a new significance. In doing so, they emphasized a specific feature of their original character, namely, that they formed a uniform and well-disciplined group. The Maruts are like brothers, among whom none is the eldest or the youngest ( V. 59. 6; 60. 5). They are equal in age (1. 165. 1) and are of one mind ( VIII. 20. 1, 21). They also look alike with their golden mantles (V. 55. 6), golden helmets (V. 54. 11), and armlets (II. 34.2). They always move about in fixed forma tions - thrice sixty (VIII. 85,8), or thrice seven (1. 133.0). These peculiarities of the Maruts must have presented to the mind of the Vedic poet the picture of the formations of well-disciplined soldiers in their uniforms. When, therefore, the memories of the original character of the Maruts were being gradually dimmed, the Vedic pocis must have naturally thought of associating them newly with their war-god, Indra. That the connection betneen the Maruls and Rudra represents a prior phase of the Marut-mythology is clearly indicated by the fewer and more or less vague references</li>

in the RV to that connection 112 On the other hand, the referen ces to the association between Indra and the Maruts are many and quite distinct Moreover, the transference of the Maruts
Rudra to Indra would appear more logical That the Maruts could have been transferred from a prominent god of the . official Vedic pantheon, like Indra, to Rudra, who was admitted into the Vedic pantheon almost under duress, 118 1s, indeed, inconceivable 114 As mentioned elsewhere, the Maruts are repre sented as increasing the strength and prowess of Iodra (III 35 9, VI 17 11) Tbey generally assist him in the battles (IJI 47 3-4, VIII 65 2-3, X 113 3 ) 115 Attention has already been drawn to a couple of passages in the RV, which seem to show that some features of the mythological connection between Indra and the Maruts may have been the reflections of the actual historical connections between a war-lord and his lieutenants In
112 Attention may be drawn, in this context, to the very significant obsce vations made by L D BARNETT (&ldquo;The Genius A Study in Indo-European Psychology&rdquo;, JRAS 1929, 731-748) According to that scholar, the strikus fact that just the Maruts have some serpent attributes (which do not belony to any other gods in the RV), such as ahibhanu (I 172 1), ahimanyu (I 618,9), ahtfufma (V 33 5), would indicate that, in the Vedic rcligious tradation, there was some old connection between the Maruts and the serpents.&rdquo; would also seem to confirm the original connection between the Maruts and Rudra (The later connection between Rudra Sıva and the serpents 13 weus known) BARNETT further points out that the Maruts of the RI art origin a host of geni, whoss primary duty is the guardianship of the Anya and his family The ord.nary man, the ranker in the Aryan armies, saw. the Maruts the celestial counterpart of humsci (BARNETT emphasizes the parallelism between the Maruts and the Fravaxis of the Apesta ) Ini Der arusche Mannerbund (Lund 1938, Sug WIKANDER has expressed some interesung vicws on this subject WIXANDER tries to prove that the ve word, marya, signified not merely a lusty young man but a member of particular society vowed to a particular cult The maryas wert, indeed, carthly counterparts of the Maruts in heaven According to tbat vhow! the two word, mary and marut, arc etymologically connected with a other

I 165 6 and VIII 7 31, the Maruts are described as having left their leader, Indra, in the lurch Elsewhere (I 170 2, 171 6) there is a clear reference to the serious differences between Indra and the Maruts It should, however, be remembered that such Incidents must have been but rare, and that they perhaps only help to confirm the historicity of Indra&rsquo;s original personality
When in the course of the development of the Vedic mytho logy, a cosmic character camc to be superimposed upon the personality of the national war god, Indra, and when Indra was consequently transformed into a raid god, a corresponding trans formation occurred in the character of the Maruts also The trusted lieutenants of the war lord now became the allies of the rain god In other words, the Maruts came to be regarded as the divinities connected with storm This is the final phase in the evolution of the character of the Maruts as presented in the RV, and that is why, in later mythology, the Maruts are usually re presented as storm gods 116
Another god, with whom lodra is associated in the RV, is Brhaspati-Brahmanaspati (II 23 18, 24 12, IV 49 1-6, VIII 96 15) A critical study of the Rgvedic hymns, which celebrate Brahmanaspati, would clearly show that that god is obviously a conscious priestly creation Without going into the details of this question, it may be pointed out that, through this god, the priestly community must have originally thought of glorifying the magic power of prayer The word, brahman (in Brahmanaspati), must be understood in the sense of the magic power of prayer As indicated above, on account of their warlıke way of life and thought, the Vedic Aryans transformed Indra therr Victorious
116 It is interest ng to note that the Vedic god, Vayu is rarely connected with the Maruts. He is only once referred to as having created the Maruts from the wornbs of the heaven (I 134 4 ) Had be naturalistic character of the Alarut been primary, there would have occurred more frequent references to the association between Vayu Vâta and the Maruts See, in this connec tion St &amp; WIXANDER, Toyu Uppsala 1941 WIKANDER says ibat in the Tilcs, myths and speculations relat ng to Vāyu Vata we have clear traces of an old relig on which must have played an important role in the common Todo-Iran an period According to him, Viyu 1 at3 was not perely a god of Wind but also of breathing the soul of the universe

warrior leader, into the supreme god of the Vedic pantheon At that time, it must have been the anxiety of some Vedic poets and priests – an anxiety which is, indeed, quite understandable - gene rally to impress upon the people that it was not merely the valour of the warriors, blessed by the national war-god Indra, which helped them towards victory In order to be truly effective that valour has to be necessarily aided by the magic power of prayer This anxiety, on the part of those Vedic poets and priests, may be said to have been mythologically expressed through the creation of Brahmanaspati In this context, attention may be drawn to the very significant fact that Brahmanaspatı, like Indra, is a god of specifically Indian origin The Vedic poets have consciously set this god by the side of Indra and have represented him as having been responsible - together with Indra - for the victorious battles against the enemies (II 23 18, IV.49 1-6) Sometimes this concern to place the magic power of prayer on par with warlıke yalour seems to have got the better of the Vedic poets As the result of this, in some passages, Brahmanaspat alone is credited, by the Vedic poets, with having accomplished the heroic deeds which are normally - and, of course, more naturally - attributed to Indra (1 40 8, II 23 11, 24 2, VI 13 1-2, X 67 5, 103 4) Some of Indra&rsquo;s exclusive epithets also have been applied to Brahmanaspati - such as, for instance, magharen (II 24 12) and sajrin (I. 40 8 117 The obvious incogruity between the basic character of Brahmanaspati, as clearly indicate by his name, and the generally warlike traits, which are sometimes attributed to him, can thus be rationally accounted for 18
117 It is likely that a peculiar reaction of this tendency is to be in the passages where Indra is referred to rather incongruously-as Aplaun (VI 20 3) brahman (VI 457) and brahmarahas (VI 45 4 )
118 As was to be expected, in course of time, Indra, the national god of the Vedic pantheon, came to be regarded as the prototype and guardian of kingship in ancient India (A XIX. 24 2, MIS II 14 AB 23 I, SPB III 9 1 16 18 ) The Shami is said to bave chosen Indra * lord (AVXII ! 37) In AV (III 46) the king is significantly reless as human Indra Corresponding to this development of the Indra-com. Brahmanaspati must have come to be regarded as the symbol of saccrue (TDI 7 7 4 )VRTRAHÃ INDRA
197
The history of the evolution of Indra&rsquo;s personality, which has been set forth above, would now make it amply clear why the Vedic mythology, as a whole, is so very greatly dominated by that god As indicated elsewhere, in course of time, Indra came to be regarded as the very symbol of the official Vedic religion This fact is fully confirmed by a peculiar mythological device which is sometimes employed in the RV Side by side with what may be called the official or hierarchical Vedic religion there had existed, in the Vedic age, several other currents of mythical and religious thought These latter seem to have been in vogue either among the masses of the Vedic people (as against the hierarchical classes) or among the non Vedic people It may be presumed that the religious and mythological ideology of these people was, for several reasons, found to be more or less unacceptable by the guardians of the official Vedic religion, which gradually tended to become sophisticated and hierarchical Their gods, therefore, must have originally received but scant recognition at the hands of the Vedic poets and priests In course of time, however, the religious cults of the masses - both Vedic and non-Vedic - must have effectively asserted themselves Consequently their gods must have inevitably forced their way into the Vedic pantheon With a view to properly consolidating this new position acquired by the popular' gods, the Vedic poets, who sponsored them, brought them into close association with Indra - more often artifi cially than otherwise Such association with Indra, the symbol of the official Vedic religion, served the purpose of settiag the seal, as it were, of official recognition for those gods 118 The association of Indra with Visnu and with Pusan, which is demon strably artificial and the result of an afterthought, belongs to this category 120 The popular gods, Visnu and Pusan, were, so to say, granted official recognition by being brought into association with Indra Except on this assumption, the relations between Visnu

<p>It has been pointed out by me in another paperi that one of the very intriguing problems of Indian mythology pertains to the elevation of the god Visnu from a more or less minor and obscure position which he occupies in Vedic mythology to the position of supreme preeminence in the later Hindu pantheon I have presented in that paper a complete picture of the various VICISSI tudes which occurred in the personality and character of that god from the point of view of what I have called evolutionary mythology, and have thereby offered a solution of that problem
A similar problem can be posed in respect of another Vedic god, namely, Rudra It must be added, in this connection, that, as a matter of fact, the importance of the problem relating to Rudra is not limited only to the study of Indian religion and mythology For, in more senses than one, the Rudra problem touches several significant aspects of the entire cultural history of ancient India As a consequence of this, the Rudra problem naturally tends to become far more complex and comprehensive than the Visau problem
A study of the Vedic literature as a whole brings out a very striking fact about the god Rudra It will appear, from that study, that there are, as it were, two distinct Rudras represented in that literature - one in the Rgieda (RV) and the other in the post-RV Vedic literature? The Rudra of the RV, for instance, is a heavenly god, while in the post-RV literature he is regarded as being essentially earthly In the RV, Rudra&rsquo;s hosts are generally represented to be the Maruts, while in the post-RV literature Rudra is accompanied by various kinds of evil spirits and dreadful beings As a matter of fact, the post-RV Rudra seems to have</p>

derived several features of his character from cannibalism and bloodthirstiness There are, however, unmistakable indications that these so called two Rudras actually constitute one and the same god A consideration of the pame, the outward appearance, and certain special features of these two Rudras would leave no doubt about their basic identity Indeed, all tbat is intended to be suggested by the foregoing statement is that the traits of Rudra&rsquo;s character which are emphasized in the RP are essentially diffcrent from those which are emphasized in the post RI' Vedic literature
A critical study of the Rudra-problem may well begin with the recountiog of what may be called the most distinctive characte tistics of that god Weak characterisation of gods is generally mentioned as a peculiar feature of the Vedic mythology It is, for instance, suggested that the concreteness, the life fulness', and the peculiar plastic mould, which distinguish the Greek gods, are almost absent so far as the Vedic gods are concerned There is a sort of paleness about them Colourless epithets and stered typed descriptions tend to make them purely conventional mythological figures Without attempting to examinc this criticism at any length, one may only point out in this context that, even assuming that this criticism is generally justifiable, it does not become applicable at least in the case of Rudra A study on the Vedic literature will show that Rudra possesses a distibct individuality of his own, which clearly bears the stamp of concre teness about it Indeed, for a god who cannot be said to have played any siga ficant role in the herarchical Vedic mytbology and ritual there are given in the Veda perhaps more particulars about Rudra&rsquo;s personality and character than would be aorminy expected
Just as the Rgvedic Rudra and the post-RV Rudra may be said to constitute two distinct personalities, the Rgvedic Kuc

himself is represented as possessing, so to say, a &lsquo;double&rsquo; perso nality He is said to be a particularly fierce god (II 33 9, 11; X 120 5), destructive like a terrible beast (II 33 11 ), unassai lable and unsurpassed in might (1 114 4, II 33 3, 10, VII, 46 1, X 92 5) The Tarttırıya Samhita says (VI 1 7 8, 2 3 2) rudro var krūro deranam (also of MS III 8 1 ) Rudra is called the ruddy boar of the heaven (I 114 5) or the great asura of the heaven (II16) A reference is frequently made to Rudra s death bringing missiles (II 33 10) As a matter of fact, fear of Rudra&rsquo;s terrible shafts and the deprecation of his wrath and ill will may be said to be the ruling sentiments of a large pumber of passages in the RV referring to Rudra (II 33 4-6, 15) He is often implored not to slay or injure men and cattle (I 114 78, VI 28 7, VII 46 2-4) but to preserve the worsłuppers and their property unharmed (II 33 3 6) Rudra&rsquo;s very name is frightening (II 33 8) A usual prayer addressed to Rudra is that he may prostrate others with bis malevolent bolt but not bring all luck in our family' (VII 46 2-4) In the post-RV Vedic literature, Rudra&rsquo;s malevolencc and wrathful ness are more frequently referred to and deprecated (VS 3 61, AV XI 2) According to the Aitareya Brahmana (III 33), Rudra is the compound of the tercible forms of the gods, while the Satapatha Brahmana tells us (IX 1 1 1,6) that even the gods are afraid of hun It is suggested in the Sankhayanass (IV 19 7 8 ) that Rudra&rsquo;s hosts attack men and beasts with disease and death
But Rudra is not exclusively malevolent and maleficent He is also represented as possessing certain positively beneficent traits Hcs said to bestow blessings on his worshippers (1 114 1, 2, II 33 6 ) and generally look after the welfare of man and beast (1 436) He is a mighty helper and a liberal giver He sees to it that the inhabitants of a village are well fed and free from disease (I 114 1) But by far the most significant

reference in this connection is the one to Rudra&rsquo;s great healing powers He is the physician of physicians (II 33 4), whose remarkable remedies are often praised by the Rgvedic poets (I 114 5, II 33 7, 12, V 42 11, VII 46 3) It is in view of this aspect of Rudra&rsquo;s character that the epithet, jalasabhesaja is exclusively bestowed on him (VIJI 29 5) Rudra&rsquo;s healing powers are referred to also in the post RV Vedic literature (AV II 27 6, VS 3 59, 16 S, 49), but less frequently than hus fright ful and destructive nature This double personality' of Rudra - as a maleficent demon and a beneficent physician at the same time - seems to have been regarded by the Rgvedic poets as the special distinguishing feature of that god The author of a well known hymn in the RV, namely, VIJI 29, has mentioned, in the right brahmody a fashion, in each stanza of that hymn only the most distinctive characteristics of a particular god without men tioning the name of that god He has thus left the reader to inter the identity of the god from those distinctive characteristics The fifth stanza in that hymn characterizes a god who is at once ferocious ( ugra) and bright and holy ( fucı), and who wields in his hand a sharp weapon (tigma ajudha) and at the same time possesses marvellous healing powers (jalasabhesaja) Obviously this is the description of Rudra, the god with double personality It must, however, be pointed out in this connection that there is Do self contradiction whatsoever in such character On the contrary, it emphasizes the fact that Rudra is not a stereotyped of conventionalised niythical figure Indeed, he is not at all ethically conceived either as an exclusively benevolent god or as an ex clusively malevolent demon It further shous that, fortunately for us, the personality of Rudra is not affected particularly vitally by the deconcretising influence of the hierarchical mythology
A reference must also be made at this stage to what may be regarded as an essentially unconventional manner in which Rudra is celebrated in the famous Satarudrija (VS 16 1 ff = TS IV 5 1 1 fr ) There he is glorified as the lord of thieves (W 16 21 ) of pulserers (22), and of plunderers (22) Not only this He is himself characterised as robber and prowler, cheater and

deceiver (21, 22) Rudra is further associated, in that hymn, with various kinds of people and places It may be difficult now to realise the true significance of some of the epithets, employed 10 the Satarudriya with reference to Rudra But one cannot on that account regard those epithets as being purely fantastico or suggest that they relate to the character and personality of Rudra 10 a loose, superficial, and artificial manner 8 On the contrary, it 15 necessary to empliasize that no theory regarding the Vedic Rudra can be acceptable which does not rationally account for the various epithets of Rudra recounted in the Satarudriya
It has been already suggested that the Vedic Rudra possesses a distinct individuality One important indication of this is to be seen in the remarkably life like description of his appearance and dress given in the Vedic literature Rudra is brown (babhru
Il 33 5 ) or red (VS 16 7) in complexion He is blue necked (VS 16 7) and blue-tufted ( AV II 27 6), his belly is black and his back red ( AV XV 1 7-8) He arranges his hair in a peculiar manner (kapardm | 114 1,5) and wears a multiform necklace (nisha) as his special omament (II 33 10) He is also descri bed as being clothed ja a skin (VS 3 61, 16 51)
These descriptions of Rudra&rsquo;s distinctive physical features and dress no doubt tend sharply to isolate him from the other Vedic gods But there are in the Vedic literature certain other indica tions, of a far more essential nature, which emphasize Rudra&rsquo;s distinctness from the other gods For instance, Rudra can be clearly marked out from the other Vedic gods on account of his peculiar position in the Vedic ritual Generally speaking one cannot say that Rudra plays any significant role in any of the important srauta sacritices Especially he fias no place in the Soma sacrifices in which all other important Vedic gods partake,

tes how all gods attained heaven while Rudra was left behind Though Rudra is thus normally depicd any honourable position in the hierarchical Brahmanical ritual,17 it is of particular interest from the point of view of the essential character of that god that, in certain kinds of grhya or popular rites such as the Sulagavat and the aśvajuji and prsataka ceremonjes, he does play a very prominent role 19 The entire position in this respect can be best summarised by saying that Rudra is excluded from homas offered in the hierarchical ritual, but he is very positively entitled to balis offered in the folk cult rites A distinction is further sought to be made between Rudra and the other Vcdic gods by emphasizing the fact that while the abode of gods in general is in the east. Rudra resides in the north Moreover, even the usual henotheistic tendencies of the Vedic poets have not led them to characterise Rudra, even once, as the crertor of the heaven and the earth It should thus become clear that, though the Veda cannot be said to exhibit any open opposition to Rudra worship as such, there are several clear indications in it which show that the Rudra worship was alien to the genuine religious ideology of the Vedic Aryans and that it was introduced in the Vedic religion perhaps under the pressure of certain peculiar circumstances
Among all the gods so the RV Rudra is most closely associa ted with the Maruts 20 A critical study of the character of the Maruts and their association with the other Vedic gods would, however, clearly produce the impression that their association with Rudra must have been but short lived 21 This fact is, indeed, of particular significance so far as Rudra&rsquo;s character in the RV is concerned Besides the Maruts, Rudra seems to have some

affinity to Agni In one passage of the RV (IL 1 6) for instance Rudra is included among the several deities identified with Agni Rudra seems to be identified with Ago also in the AV (VII 87 1) the Tanttiriya Samhita (V 4 3 1 574) and the Satapaiha Brahmana (VI 1 3 10) In the Taittırıy: Samhita (1 2 2 3) Rudra is called the terrific form (ghora tanuh) of Agni 2 But in several such passages it appears as if the word, rudra, is used rather as an adjective 29 But surely of a far more
insic nature is Rudra&rsquo;s relationship with Sarya and Bhava It is, indeed significant that these latter gods are referred to exclusi vely in the post RV literature In some passages in the AV-like
va though more or less similar, are represented as being distinct from each other and from Rudra But in the same Veda there are clear indications (X1 2) of Rudra&rsquo;s identity with them in the Vi jasaneyi Samuta (16 18, 28 ) Sarva and Bhava are actually mentioned as the names ol Rudra, while in the SanklayanaśS (IV 20 1) they are said to be Rudra&rsquo;s (Mahadeva&rsquo;s) sons Attention must be drawn), in this connection, to the very significant passage in the Satapatha-Bran mana (1 7 38) according to which Sarva was specially worshipp ed by the eastern people and Bhava by the Vahikas who are per* haps the same as the people of Bahlika in the North West It is suggested that like Sarva and Bhava Pasupati also was originally an independent god But owing to the essential similarity of the characters of the gods Pasupati and Rudra the word, pasupali, Was either used as a frequent epithet of Rudra in the post R literature or the two gods were represented as being actually identical The identity between Rudra on the one hand, and Sarva, Bhava, and Pasupati, on the other, seems to be further suggested by such references as those ja which Sarva Bhavs, Rudra, and Pasupati are said to be the different names of Agni or these four with four others are said to represent the eight forms of Agni 26 It is further suggested that Tryambaka also was

originally a god who was distinct from Rudra but who was later identificd with him Finally, there can be no doubt whatever about the essential similarity of the Vedic Rudra to Siva As a matter of fact, even a casual comparison of the characterisation of Rudra in the Salarudrna with the normal descriptions of Siva occurring in the post-Vedic literature would seem to suggest that these two gods must have been basically one and the same
A particularly distinctive characteristic of Rudra is his peculiar relation with what appear to have been distinct religious cults in ancient times In this connection a reference must first be made to RY X 136 This hymn clearly relates to the specific orgiastic cult of the munis These munis seem to have worn long hair and indulged in a sort of ecstasy-producing medicament (X 136 ) There are also indications that they attained certain miraculous or mystic powers which are comparable to the powers which are believed to be attained through yoga Rudra is represented in this niuni suhla almost as the leader of that cult (X 136 7)
Further, there is in the AV a remarkable hymn (XI 5), which is known as the bralimacāri sukta It is generally assumed that this hymn extols the Vedic student 17 Some of the descrip tions of the brahmacarın given in this hymn, such as that the bralımacārın was long bearded (XI 5 6), would, however, seem to go against such an assumption The various claims made in this hymn on behalf of the brahmacarın (XI S 8, 9, 16-19) would also seem rather incongruous so far as the normal Vedic.

the universe, is here for the nonce imagined as a brahmacarin, a Brahmanical disciple, engaged in the practice of his holy vows &ldquo;, will also, on further scrutiny, be found to be quite unacceptable A critical study of the bralimacārı sükta would seem to indicate that its central theme was the glorification of a specific religious cult called the brahmacārm cult The followers of this religious cult seem to have lived a life of rigorous discipline wluch is clearly indicated by such words as samidh, mekhala, śrama, tapas, gharma, bliksa, etc (XI 5 4 8,9). With the full fledged deve lopment of the concept of the aśramadharma, at a later stage many features of the disciplined life of penance, which characterised the religious cult of the braliniacarins, seem to have been transferreo to the life of studentship or brahmacarya In the AV, the members of the religious cult of the brahmacarins are described as “cloth ing themselves with heat gharma) and standing up with fervour (tapas)” (XI 55) As the result of their severe penance this were believed to be endowed with special virile powers (XI $12) Not only this As is usual in such cases, they were surther sald to be responsible for several cosmic functions (XI 5 8,11,19-22) What is, however, perhaps more significant for our present pur pose is that this hymn contains certain indications regarding &amp; more essential aspect of this cult On tlie basis of these foule
tions it may be presumed that the brahmacarın cult was very closely related to the Rudra worship As a matter of fact, certain descriptions of the typical brahmacärin, occurring in this by tend to remind one of Rudra Siva For instance, the brahmid carın is described as being followed by the gandharyas (XIS).

evidence in this connection is the characterization of the brahma carin as the possessor of grcat penis (brlacchepa) and the spriokler of the seed (rerah sincan) (XI 5 12) There can be hardly any doubt that it must have been the concept of Rudra Siva which was intended to be indicated by these descriptions It may, therefore, be assumed that Rudra was associated, in a special manner, with the ancient religious cults of the munis (RV X. 136) and the bralımacārins (AV XI 5) 3*
There is a third, and perhaps much more important, ancient religious cult with which Rudra was vitally connected - namely, the cult of the var, as From a critical study of the Vedic sources relating to tlus cult33 - particularly of the AV and the Pancavimša Bralunana — it becomes quite eyident that the yrätyas had developed their own distinctive religious ideology, social order, and general way of life They seem to have called the Supreme Being by the name of chavratya Certain features of the physical appearance of the ekavratza such as blue belly and red back ( AV XV 1 7), unmistakably remind one of Rudra The same can be said about the peculiar apparel worn by the vrătyas Particularly the niska mentioned in that connection ( PancaBr XVII 1) is reminiscent of Rudra&rsquo;s niska (II 33 10 The vratias seem to have become distinguished on account of their peculiar asceticism and yogic practices (XV 31, 15 1-9) Among their principal tutelary gods are mentioned Bhava, Sarva, Pasupali, Ugra, Rudra, Mahudeva and Išāda (XY 5 Sometimes the chavratya is actually identified with Mahādeva (XV I. 4) It is further suggested in the AV that the

yrāt, as did not approve of Brahmanic sacrifices (XV 12 1-4) It may also be mentioned that the râty as used to partake of a kind of intoxicating drink ( sura ) presumably as a part of their orgiastic religious practice and that their whole life was governed by a number of solemn vows (XV 3) 35 All these facts would lead to two irresistible conclusions namely that the vrātjas formed a distinct and an independent religious cult in ancient times and that their religious ideology had very close affinity to the persona lity and the worship of Rudra According to the Pancavimsa Br, the vratya community was broadly divided into two classes - the arhars and the Jaudhas 34 The same Brāhmana further says that the vratyas were divided into four classes, namely, hind, garagır, samanıcamedhra, and nındıra Out of these four classes, the garagır (= swallowers of poison) and the Samanıcamedhra (=one whose penis hangs low through control of passion) are of particular interest from our point of view in so far as they very emphatically underline the close relationship which must have subsisted between Rudra and the religious cult of the vraty as it may be recalled that like the garagır, the munis also are described as drinking poison (visa in the company of Rudra (X 136 1 Similarly, the same samanicamedhra given to a class of the valjas would remind one of the rigorous penances and yogic practices observed by the munis and the brahmacarins *7 One would, there fore, be justified, in presuming that the three religious CUIS namely, those of the vratyas, the munis, and the brahmacarins though perhaps originally distinct from and independent of one another, had considerable basic similarity in point of ideo and practice It may be further emphasized that, as pointed out

above, Rudra&rsquo;s close connection with these cults constitutes a particularly distinctive feature of the personality and character of that god
This enumeration of Rudra&rsquo;s distinctive characteristics will sot be complete without a mention of that god&rsquo;s inherent associa tion with what may be broadly called the demon world Rudra is thereby clearly isolated from other major Vedic gods It will be seen that three distinct classes of beings are principally men. tioned as being the followers of Rudra, namely, the Rudras, the Maruts and the Rudraganas As a matter of fact, these three classes of beings associated with Rudra can be said to corres pond with the three distinct stages in the evolution of Rudra&rsquo;s character and personality The Maruts are often characterised in the RV as rudral or rudrāsah ( I 39 4, 7, 64 3, 85 2, 100 5, 101 7, 166 2. II 34 9. 13. VIIL 7 12. X 64 8,92 6) They are Rudra&rsquo;s sons (I 64 12, VI 66 11 ) or Rudra&rsquo;s marjas (I 64 2, VII 56 1) Rudra is correspondingly represented as marunon (1 114 11, II 33 6 ) or as the father of the Maruts (1 114 6, V 60 5) An impression is, therefore, likely to be produced that the Rudrns and the Maruts are essentially identical This would not, however, constitute a correct estimate of the character of these two classes of beings For one thing, it should be remembered that the Maruts are not invariably called Rudras HILLEBRANDT, for instance, has drawn attention to the very significant fact that in the fourth and the sixth mandalas of the RV, the Maruts do not at all appear as Rudras $ In some passages, the Maruts are no doubt almost completely identified With the Rudras But there are also other passages in the RY (II 31 1, 3, VIII 13 28, 54 3, X 664) wherein the Maruts and the Rudras arc mentioned as tho distinct classes of beings
The characterisation of the Maruts as Rudras, therefore, sccms to have been only incidental and perhaps intended to serve some specific purpose Secondly, the Maruts appear, in the RV, and, indeed, more frequently than otherwise, as the followers of

tional manner On the other hand, in consonance with the new character in which Rudra mainly came to be represented in the RY, he was associated with the Maruts $1 And, consequently, the name of the original Rudras- but not their essential character - came to be traasferred to the Maruts This would explain why, in the RV, the Maruts are characterised as Rudras but are, at the same time, represented as being definitely distinct from
them Later, in the course of the evolution of the Yedic my. thology, the mythology relatiog to Rudra and the Maruts took a different tum altogetherRudra tended to regain his pristiac character and, conscquently, the allegiance of the Maruts came to be transferred from Rudra to Indra In this process the origi nal character of the Maruts was almost unrecognizably transfor med and the relationship between Rudra and the Rudras regained its old vitality in the later Vedic literature The Rudras are there represented as being eleven in number (TSI I 9, III 4 97, VII 1 18, ŚPB IV 5 72, AB I 10 S, TUB VI 2S) and possessing a demoniac strain in their character (TAI 12) lo coonection with the Sulasara they are actually shown as demo.

In the post-Vedic literature Rudra Siva is represented as beiog followed by various classes of spirits and demoniac beings often referred to as Rudraganas, Bhutas, or Sivaganas - most of whom show ap cssen tial affinity with the original Rudras It would thus seen that the relationship betwcen Rudra and the Rudras was original and organic, that it was temporanly suppressed in the RV and the Naruts took the place of thc Rudras, that in the later Veda the ancient Rudra Rudras combination was revived, and that, snally, in the post-Vedic literature the ancient Rudras assumed the form of the Rudra ganas or the Sivaganas

While speaking of the followers of Rudra reference must necessarily be made to the fact that, besides the Rudras serpents are associated with Rudra in a more or less special manner The relation between Rudra and the serpents cannot be regarded merely as an offshoot of that god s character as pašupati It is certainly of a more intrinsic nature According to the Anukra mani, AV III 26 and 27 pertain to Rudra Out of these two hymns III 26 is a magical incantation against demons of all sorts, while III 27 1$ specially characterised as constituting 2 serpent charm Similarly the devata of the two stanzas, namely, AV VI 56 2-3, is said to be Rudra, and they are directed against serpents Conversely, AV XII 1 46, which is obviously 30 Incantation against the serpents, accompanies an oblation to be made by the Brahman priest in the satarudrıyahoma Further, in the AśvGS IV 8 28, serpents are mentioned among the mani fold and more or less curiously named followers of Rudra who share an offering made to him, 43 and, according to the Hiranja GS (I 5 16 10 ), in a place infested with serpents, offering is made to Rudra &lsquo;wbo sits among the serpents. It will be tous seen that just as among the followers of the Rudra cult are mentioned several classes of what may be called &lsquo;non social, &ldquo;uncıvılısed&rsquo;, and barbarous people, 4. so also among that god s paraphernalia are included several classes of what may be called &lsquo;non godly&rsquo;, demoniac beings
An attempt has been made above to lay bare the complex personality of Rudra by clearly setting forth the most distinctive and exclusive features of that god as represented in the Vedic literature It is needless to add that any theory pertaining &quot; Rudra must needs take into account all these aspects of character Not only that, it must also rationally accommodate within itsell all those characteristics of that god Obviously enough, this will be possible only on the assumption of the evold tionary character of the Vedic mythology Before, however,

uadertaking to reconstruct the entire picture of the &lsquo;becoraing&rsquo; of Rudra, in the light of evolutionary mythology, it would be help ful critically to examine some of the important theories regarding Rudra&rsquo;s character put forth by scholars
One of the most common views regarding Rudra is that he is a storm-god in the Veda 45 Attempt is made by scholars first to establish the heavenly character of Rudra Rudra is divah asurah (II 16. VIII 20 17) or the red hog of the heaven (1 114 5) He sends down his arrows from the heaven (VII 46 3) In X 92 9, Rudra is said to come down to the earth from heaven It is further pointed out that this god of the heaven wields a thunderbolt in his hand (II 33 3) Elsewhere Rudra&rsquo;s weapon 15 said to have been duyut (VII 46 3), which word is understood in the sense of vidyut, gleaming boit or lightning The character of Rudra as a god of tempest would thus become quite obvious even from these few references How ever, according to HOPKINS,46 nothing could be plainer and more convincing in this connection than the prayer addressed to Rudra that his lightning, which, hurled down from the sky, passes along the carth, might avoid the worsbipper (VII 46 3)&rsquo; In equally clear terms is Rudra invoked in the AV not to assail the worshipper with celestial fire and * to cause the lightping to descend elsewhere' (XI 2 26 There can, therefore, be hardly any doubt as to the essential fulgurent nature of Rudra Accord ing to the naturalistic interpretation of the Vedic mythology, the Maruts are represented to be the divinities connected with the phenomenon of storm Rudra is the father of the Maruts (I. 114 6, 9, II 33 1) and must, therefore, also be assumed to be more definitely connected with storm In this connection HOPKINS suggests 47 that the Maruts, who are quite unadultera ted nature gods, are the original ruddy ones (rudrah), their female

companion is rodası ( the ruddy one), and their father is Rudra, the ruddy one par excellence This recurring reference to
ruddiness' 1 plies that Rudra and the Maruts represent more particularly the fury of the tempest Rudra is indeed, te presented in the RV as a god of red lightning
Besides thus being organically copnected with the heaven, the lightning and the Maruts, who are the storm gods, Rudra is described as making the streams flow over the earth (X 92 5) In another context (V 58 7), the sons of Rudra are said to make rain of their sweat The epithet, midhvas, which is derived from the root, mith (=to shower), and which is usually applied in the RV to a rain bringing storm god, is applied also to Rudra (1 114 3) thus confirming his character as such a god The double character of Rudra, namely, frightful and destructive on the one hand and kindly and beneficent on the other, can be best explained on the assumption that he is a storm god For, while Rudra s gleaming bolt (didyur) might spell distress and destruc tion, the rains which he brings prove to be a veritable boon to humanity Apart from the obvious efficacy of waters in condec tion with fertilization, etc, special emphasis seems to have been put on their peculiar medicinal properties, particularly in so far as these waters are produced by Rudra Rudra is the physician 01 physicians (II 33 4) and possesses remarkable healing powers (II 33 4,7) He is the master of numerous choice remedies (1 114 5, II 33 12, V 42 11, VII 46 3) Rudra s healing powers are also referred to in the AV (11 27 6) and the (3 59, 16 5,49 ) The medicinal potency of waters is fully recognised in the RV In I 23 20, for instance, we are told that medical remedies subsist within waters (apsu antar visi bhesaja) 48 The epithet jalasabhesaja is exclusively attributed Rudra (1 43 4, VIII 29 5, AV II 276) Most of the scholars who sponsor the storm god theory understand the word jalasa, bhesaja to mean &lsquo;one whose medicinal remedies consist of

waters. The close connection between the waters and Rudra is thus well established Rudra, as the leader of the Maruts, is the water causing god and, therefore, medicinally very potent It is very significant to note, in this connection, that, in other passages, waters as medicines are associated with the Maruts (V 53 14) and the medicinal remedies are said to come down from the sky (X 599)
With a view to supporting the storm god theory reference is further made to the facts that the wind is described as Rudra&rsquo;s arrow,&rdquo; and that, in the Satarudnya, Rudra is characterised as the lord of rains, clouds, lightning, and winds 50 HOPKINS thinks that Rudra&rsquo;s description as a god of blue neck and red belly is also suggestive of cloud and lightning 51 Some of the sponsors of the storm god theory have sought to derive the word, rudra from the root rud ( = to roar Rudra is therefore, accordiog to them, the roaring or thundering storm god
A critical examination of the storm god theory as set forth above will clearly reveal its many serious deficiencies To begin with, it may be pointed out that that theory is based more or less exclusively on the evidence derived from the RV, when, as a matter of fact, a fuller and a more living picture of that god is presented in the post RV Vedic literature Even in the RV itself there are no unambiguous and convincing references to Rudra as the god of tempest. For instance, against the overwhelming evidence pertaining to Rudra&rsquo;s essentially earthly character, the only three passages which connect him directly with the heaven

(I 114 5, II 16, VIII 20 17 ) can be said to possess but little probative value On the other hand, those passages seem to in dicate that attempts were made by the Rgvedic poet priests arti ficially - and even tendentiously - to thrust the heavenly character on that god Again much credence is given by the sponsors of the storm god theory to Rudra&rsquo;s characterisation as vajrabahu (11 33 3) wielder of the thunderbolt As has been pointed out elsewhere,62 in the RV, the word, iara, does not unequivocally denote the thunderbolt That sense seems to have come to be attached to that word, if at all, only at a latter stage Further, it should be remembered that this characteristic, namely, the wield ing of the vajra, is not at all original to the concept of Rudra It seems that the vajra, which had an essential and organic connection with the Indra mythology, lost its original significance in the course of the evolution of the Vedic mythology and even. tually came to be regarded as a conventional adjunct of a Vedic god - more or less as a poctic device employed to glorify a Vedic god Consequently even such gods as Agni and Varuna, who are most obviously, not storm gods, are described as bearing the vajra (1 109 7, IV 41 4) As for the word, didyut, it can be stated, perbaps more definitely, that that word, which is used in connection with Rudra (VII 463) and on which HOPKINS
uch of his evidence in support of the storm god theory, can hardly be regarded as possessing the sense of lighin ing Jo sone passages of the RV that word is used in a very general sense (VI 66 10, VIII 6 7), while elsewhere (1 661, VII 34 13) it is used in connection with the gods who are obvio usly not storm gods It is also significant that in some Rgvedic passages, the word, didyu, is used to denote weapons of human warriors (IV 41 11, VIL 85 2, X 38 1). The celestial fire referred to in AV XI 2 26 cannot be understood to mean ligh. ing, and, though the word, vidyut, is actually used in that context, the fact that it occurs together with such words as takman (fever) and visa (poison) seems to suggest that it is used not in the definitive sense of lightning but in a general and more or less
52
Scc “Vrtrahi ladra&rdquo;
RUDRA IN THE VEDA
219
rhetorical sense of something frightful and destructive. Whilc speaking of vajra and didyut, which are claimed to have been the special weapons of Rudra, it is necessary to add that, from the references in the RV, it rather appears that the bow and the arrows were actually more natural to Rudra (II. 33. 10,11; Y. 42, 11; X. 125.6; ŚPB IX. 1.1.6). In X. 64.8, Rudra is very significantly associated with archers.63
The facts that the Maruts are called rudrijāh and that Rudra is described as the father of the Maruts cannot also be claimed to prove Rudra&rsquo;s character as storm-god. It may be, first of all, poin ted out that the Maruts were not originally the storm-gods. They came to be regarded as such only after certain naturalistic elements were superimposed upon the original heroic personality and charac ter of Indra. As a matter of fact, the association of the Maruts with lodra is itself secondary. As indicated above, even their asso ciation with Rudra, though earlier than that with Indra and, there fore, more original so far as the RV is concerned, must have been the result of the emphasis put by the Rgvedic poet-priests on some specific aspect of Rudra&rsquo;s character. That is why the relationship between Rudra and the Maruts does not produce the impression of being a living relationship. And even assuming, as HILLEBRANDT does, that the Maruts are the storm-gods, has not that scholar himself pointed out5t that, in the Vedic mytho logy, the fathers may have outward resemblance with their child ren, but there does not necessarily exist any similarity so far as their essential characters are concerned 56</li>

among physicians But it is, indeed, difficult to understand how such references can be construed as indicating that Rudra is the rain bringing storm god There is hardly any cvidence to show that Rudra&rsquo;s medicinal remedies consisted mainly of waters To interpret 1hc word, Jalása, occurring in Rudra&rsquo;s exclusive cpithet, jalaşabhesaja in the sense of ordinary waters is certainly un convincing in the RV, one bardly comes across any clear referencc to Rudra as the water-giving god BLOOYFIELD refers in this connection to the two possages,&rdquo; I 64 6 and 85 5, where, according to that scholar, the words, 1ājinam and arusasja are indicative of Rudra A closer study of those passages would, however, show that BLOOMFICLD&rsquo;s assertion is certainly loo farfetched Further, nothing very significant can be proved by Rudra&rsquo;s cpithet, midhos As a matter of fact, the derivation of that word from the root mih ( to shower) 13 itself very doubtful Moreover, it will be seen that that epithet is attributed not only to the so called rain gods, for, besides Indra, Agai, Mitra, Varuna, Visnu and Soma, among others, arc also characterised as midhas it would appear that the word generally everywhere meant &ldquo;liberal' So far as the characterisation of Rudra in the Satarudrua as the lord of rains, etc, is concerned it may be pointed out that, in that important Rudra-hymo, ove has carefully to sift thc esscotial from the conventiopal
One thus feels inclined to agree with OLDENBERG when he says that Rudra&rsquo;s very physiognomy' is different from that of the normal storm-gods of the Veda Thc features which are usually associated in the Veda with the storm god mythology are conspicuously absent in Rudra 5: The few that one may discover are quite incidental and irrelevant A Vedic passage can hardly be quoted which unmistakably characterises Rudra as a raid
56 AJP, XII (1891), 425 ff 57 Both the passages occur in the hymns whose decald is the Narut 58 RAY, 221
59 According to OLDENBERC, in the Vedic descriptions of Rudra, light ings do not flash, rains do not pour down, winds do not rush forth (320S 19, cl) He, therefore, concludes that, at least in the consciousoess of Vedic poet, Rudra was not a god of tempest.

bringing storm god Moreover, it mav be asked When such a prominent god as Indra was, at a certain stage in the evolution of his personality, represented as a storm god, why should a more or less minor god like Rudra also have been represented as a storm god? The suggestion that Rudra must have &lsquo;originally represented not the storm pure and simple, but rather its baleful side in the destructive agency of lightning 60 — implying thereby that Iadra represented the beneficent rain bringing aspect of the storm god — 15 definitely vitiated by the frequent Vedic references to Rudra&rsquo;s medicines and healing powers Finally, it is needless to add that the distinctive features of Rudra&rsquo;s personality and character detailed above, such as his characteristic appearance and dress.81 his connection with the demon world and the
unsocial&rsquo; classes of the community, his special relationship with the religious cults of the yrālyas, the brahmacarins, and the munis bis isolation from other Vedic gods, and his essential similarity to Pasupatı, Sarva Bhava, and Siva, who are definitely not storm gods do not fit in well with the storm god theory
A reference may be incidentally made, in this context, to the view of certain scholars who, while accepting the celestial character of Rudra, do not regard him as a storm god BERGAIGNE, for instance, says that Rudra possesses few, if any, features of a normal storm god in the Veda in the opinion of that scholar, Rudra is rather the celestial father 63 KUHN, on the other hand, suggests that Rudra is more akin to Greek
60 ALACDONELL VA, 77, also TRAS 27, 97 HOPKINS 70S 16, cli On the other hand it may be pointed out in this context, that according to certain other scholars, the deification of lightning was not accepted by the Indians

Apollo et According to SIECKE,&amp; the Rgvedic evidence shows that Rudra, like scieral other gods, is a god of light, with the moon as the physical substratum It is hardly necessary to point out that these and similar other theories do not at all account for the distinctive characteristics of Rudra&rsquo;s persopality men tioned above
The same thing must be said about the attempts made to identify Vedic Rudra with Aeni Io the Veda, the word, rudra is sometimes used more or less as an epithet of Agni ( TSI 211, II 2 2 3) while in some other passages there are indications that that god is actually identified with Agni (II 16, common TMB XII 4 24) Again, references such as rudro vai esa jad agnih ( TS V 4 3 1) occur frequently in the Vedic literature
The Taillirija Samhita (ISI) narrates a legend to explain why Agoi came to be called Rudra At the time of the war between the gods and the demons, the gods, before going to the battle field appointed Agnt as the custodian of their property Agni became greedy and, while the war was still going on, he abscondeu with the property of the gods After their victorious return from the battlefield the gods were surprised to find that Agai was missing They, therefore, sent out parties to find him out Eventually the gods found out Agni and forced him to return their property On that occasion, Agni wept (arodit) and there fore, came to be known as rudra (from the root rud == to weep) It is also suggested that Rudra is called irj ambala, that is, obe having three mothers in the same way as Agni is said to have three mothers Attention is drawn in this connection also to a passage in the Taittirija Samhita (IJ 2 10), which recommends that a sick person should offer an oblation jointly to Soma and Rudra For, as the text proceeds to say a sick person is in te of the replenishment of rasa ( =liquid elements ) and sarira (solid elements) in his body By offering an oblation to Somarudrau

such person will acquire rasa from Soma and sarira from Agni The identification of Rudra with Agni, it is averted, thus becomes quite obvious in this passage Similarly, whule introducing the Satarudrija, it is said that the hymn is intended for the purpose of pacifying the fearful aspect of Agni 67 According to WEBER 68 the name Rudra (from the root rud) denotes both the roaring of the storm and the crackling of the fire The storm nature of Rudra and the fire nature of Rudra, which were originally distinct came to be merged together, and this resulted in the conception of the personality of Siva WEBER adds that this blending toge ther of Rudra&rsquo;s two patures had already been accomplished at the time of the Satarudrija 69
It is not at all necessary to examine in detail this hypothesis regarding Rudra&rsquo;s identity with Agdi Let it be at once pointed out that the Rgvedic hymns give no foundation for such an identification - On the contrary the distinctive descriptions in the RV of Rudra&rsquo;s character and personality clearly go to show that, in the minds of the authors of the Veda, Rudra and Agni were quite distinct concepts It is true that, in RVI 1 6, Rudra is identified with Agoi, but it must be remembered that, in that hymn, several other gods also are identified with Agni Such references must, therefore, be regarded as purely conventional It is also likely that Rudra&rsquo;s fury was symbolically represented by the Vedic poets as fire Later on such representation presumably led to some kind of theological speculation in this connection apd eventually resulted in the ephemeral identification of the two gods Were Rudra actually identical with Agni, his emphatic

exclusion from hierarchical Vedic ritual would become utterly un understandable And, further if Rudra were identical with Agor there was no reason why he should have been connected with robbers, thieves hupters etc On account of his peculiar origin and character Rudra&rsquo;s name was taboo imong the classes of the Vedic poet priests At the same time that god could not be altogether ignored and banished by them It is therefore not improbable that Rudra was often represented as concealing under the names of Agn: 71 At any rate, there can be hardly any doubt that Agni and Rudra stand for two distinct religious ideologies – the one prjestly ritualistic and the other popular and folkcultish
HILLEBRANDT is a confirmed believer in the naturalistic interpretation of Vedic mythology But his analysis of Rudras character from the naturalistic point of view, leads him to enun ciate quite a novel theory 72 He starts by pointing out that the Rgvedic evidence is definite enough to show that Rudra was neither a mountain god73 nor a demon of the nether world later elevated to godhead 74 On the strength of several references 10 the Vedic literature - particularly post RV Vedic literature - 10 then tries to establish that Rodra is really a form of Agni ( AV VII 87 1, XIX 55 5) He is, indeed fire in its terrible form But HILLEBRANDT does not stop here He seeks to correlato this character of Rudra with three other principal features of the Rudra mythology as represented in the Veda,
ed in the Veda, pamely, Rudras two fold character as creator and destroyer, his close association with autumn and his redness' as indicated by the name, Rudra The final conclusion wbich one may thereby arrive at is, accord ing to that scholar, that Rudra does not represent normal domes tic or ritualistic fire, but that he is the god of the tropical beat before raids He represents the result of an apotheosis of

The theory put forth by HILLEBRANDT is, indeed, more in genious than convincing It must be pointed out at the outset that such an apotheosis of climatic conditions, as suggested by that scholar, is perfectly discordant with the usual mode of thou ght of the Vedic poets Moreover, Rudra&rsquo;s appearance, apparel, and associations as described in the Veda, are far too concrete and life like to warrant the suggestion that the concept of that god is the result of a tendency to defy the more or less abstract natural phenomenon of the tropical heat before the advent of rains One may also quite justifiably doubt whether the Vedic Indian did really entertain such great fright about the transition from the hot to the rainy season Several passages can, indeed, be found in classical Sanskrit literature wherein such change is actually regarded as quite welcome Rudra&rsquo;s isolation from the other Vedic gods is a characteristic feature of that god Why the god of tropical heat should have been so isolated from the other gods, who also, according to HILLEBRANDT, represent the deification of various natural phenomena, is ununderstandable To suggest that Rudra is excluded from the Vedic ritual on acco

unt of his frightful nature is certainly not convincing Further, HILLEBRANDT does not seem to have properly realised that in Rudra&rsquo;s character the main emphasis is placed on his devastating activity as such and not on any specific season in which that activity may appear to culminate It also does not become clear why such an artificial mythological creation, as HILLEBRANDT considers Rudra to have been, should have in later times become so prominent a god As a matter of fact, none of the naturalistic theories about Rudra&rsquo;s personality and character can account satisfactorily for Rudra&rsquo;s elevation from the position of a god, who is accepted by the hierarchical poet priests of the Veda almost on sufferance and with suspicion, to a position of great importance and significance in later Hindu religious thought and practice 19
In his characterization of Rudra OLDENBERG has laido special emphasis on that god&rsquo;s connection with forests and moun tains Arcording to him, that connection is far more vital and essential than Rudra&rsquo;s connection with storm and Lightning Rudra is frequently called girişanta, girira, gırısa, etc (TS IV 51) He is further characterized 10 that Vedic text as vanānām

mally worshipped outside the village Offerings to be made to Rudra must be such as are not derived from the village; they must be derived from the forest So also nothing connected with the Salagava rite, which is offered to Rudra, may be brought back in the village or the house 83 Rudra is, jodeed, asked to go far away from the human habitations to Mujavat mountain after bav ing received his portion 81 It may also be pointed out, in this con nection, that, according to the Kausika Sutra 51 7-8, in the stas• tyayana ceremony, offerings are generally made to mountains and specifically to Bbava, Sarva, Pasupatı, Ugra, Rudra, Mahadeva, and Iśāna, respectively with the hymns, AV V 6 and AV XI 2 In one passage of the AV, Rudra is actually referred to as the prince of mountains,85 while Bhava and Sarva, who may be regarded, for all practical purposes as Rudra&rsquo;s doubles, are characterized as mountain dividities (parvatadevară) by Kesaya, the commentator of the Kausika Sutra Rudra&rsquo;s essentially sylvan character and mountain nature seem to be indicated also by the instructions given in connection with certain Vedic rites $6 The animals to be offered at a sacrifice are to be carefully guarded by a watch man during the course of the sacrifice IF, however, any of these animals is drowned it is to be dedicated to Varuna, and if it is bitten by a serpent or killed by a lion it is to be dedicated to Rudra 87 OLDENBERG further believes that Rudra&rsquo;s peculiar association with robbers and other wild and barbarous people,
Datarudriya, can be properly explained only on the assumption that that god was the god of mountainous regions which are the usual haunts of such people Rudra is, thereros, naturally connected also with several wild animals (AV X1 224) Rudra&rsquo;s particularly close connection with serpents is quite w koown and must, again, be regarded as being indicative of character as a god of mountains It is further significant that, the Vedic literature, Rudra is sometimes represented as a &quot;

The reference in the Taittirija-Samlıtā (IV 5 10 4) that Rudra keeps his weapons on the tops of tall trees would, again, seer to confirm Rudra&rsquo;s character as a god of the wilds and mountains From his mountain recesses and from among the forests Rudra visits men and cattle, from time to time, with sick ness, disease, and death, which are his weapons On the other band, he also possesses miraculous healing powers and, if properly propitiated, would bring wonderful remedies to his worshippers. The hymns addressed to Rudra are characterized on the one hand by a fear of his arrows and on the other by a prayer that he do guard men and cattic and make his wonderful medicines available to his worshippers
On the strength of all this evidence, OLDENBERG concludes that Rudra is essentially &quot; the Old Man of the Mountains” with out any celestial attributes-&lsquo;a demon of discase coming from forest and mountain, like Mars Silvanus &lsquo;89 He regards Rudra as * a relation of those European types whose nature MANNHARDI has developed in so masterly a way, Fauni and Silvanı, wood men, wild people from the desert, from mountain and wood, come the sickness spirits or darts of sickness to human abodes These are the hosts or the shafts of Rudra, who dwells in the mountain. 21 This is Rudra&rsquo;s true character B2 But, according

to OLDENBERG, the poet priests of the RV have considerably subordinated this character by mixing up different types of ele ments in the Rudra-concept For instance, Rudra&rsquo;s association with the Maruts is the result of such mingling together of ideo logies The mountain god&rsquo; type and the spirit&rsquo; type of my. thologies have, in the present case, reacted on each other In the later Vedic and post-Vedic literature. On the other hand, Rudra has been represented mostly in his true colours The character of Siva as the Old Man of the Mountain is, for instance, unmistakable o
OLDENBERG has certainly very rightly emphasized one very important characteristic of Rudra&rsquo;s personality, namely that Rudra is essentially a god belonging to the earth and that his so called celestial attributes are quite superficial and conventional &quot; OLDENBERG&rsquo;s theory further implies that the concept of Rudra is not the result of any poetic attempt to defy a phenomenon of nature 95 By means of this, what may be called anthropological, approach to the Rudra problem OLDENBERG, who normally adheres to the naturalistic interpretation of the Vedic mythology,
93 A rcference may be made here to the view that Rudra is a Dravidia god and essuntially a mountain deity The concept of such a god as Rudra It is averred, can have been evolved only among the wild mountam dweuch (as the Dravidians must have been?) and not among the dwellers on the plains like the Aryans (SAKHARE, History and Philosophy of the Lingayal Rangol, p 133) In later timcs Rudra Sıva is actually called Mallayyš Tus latid name 15 to be connected with the Dravidian word, male ( =mountain Incidentally it may be pointed out that QUARITCH WALES has recenoy expressed the view (JRAS, 1953, 23-30 ) that a cult of the sacred mountain of its derivatives regarded as representing the concentration of the care energies, was formerly widespread in Asia He refers, in this context, to v tas the mountain lord

may be said to have substantially cleared the ground for a correct appraisal of the character and personality of Rudra in the Veda This should not, however, be understood to mean that OLDEN BERG&rsquo;s entire theory is by itself acceptable It must be pointed out at the outset that OLDENBERG has based his hypothesis mostly on the post-RV evidence He has accordingly not taken into account some very distinctive features of Rudra&rsquo;s character, which are indicated in the RV It will be seen that, in the few hymns of the RV, which are addressed to Rudra, the emphasis is put not so much on Rudra&rsquo;s abode in the mountains, as OLDEN BERG&rsquo;s theory would seem to suggest, as on his fearful attack on men and beasts with his death bringing weapons Again, OLDEN BERG has not been able satisfactorily to account for Rudra&rsquo;s close association with the Maruts His suggestion that it may have been the result of the mingling together of two distinct types of mythologies fails to carry conviction Further, Rudra cannot be said to have been associated exclusively with the mountains. As a matter of fact, he is closely connected with several other regions and localities while, in the Safarudriya, he is charac terized as girisant, girisa, giritra, etc, he is also referred to in that hymn as kūpya, kulya, nadya, etc On the other hand, some other gods like Visnu (1 154 2, 3) and Indra (X 180 2) are described as mountain dwelling (giriksit, giristhā). These facts CODsiderably weaken the force of OLDENBERG&rsquo;s hypothesis 38 It 18 Only with a view to emphasizing the fact that Rudra&rsquo;s essential character is not in conformity with the normal life of the home and the village that he is described as belonging to wild mountain

Like every other primitive religion, the Vedic Aryan religion also must have had it owa Rudra or şnuier presence&rsquo; (OTTO con phasizcs Rueiras close relationship with European Wuotan) Against Orto, it may bc pointed out, firstly, that the concept of Rudra i far too concrete and,
econdly, that the attitude of aversion with which Rudra 13 generally regarded in the Veda seems to go against the Aryan origin of that god
96 At the same tune it is difficult to accept MACDONELL : view (JRAS 1900, 383) that Rudra s apecial connccuon with mountains a result of 152: later mythological tendency to localization which appears, for example, in the case of the Gandharvas and Apsarases

regions When, for instance, Rudra is asked to go away to the Mujavat mountain it is certainly not implied that Rudra&rsquo;s abode 15 in the Mujayat mountain 97 &quot; Go away to the Mujavat&rdquo; - this had almost become an imprecatory formula which implied a sort of banishment to a place as far away as possible from the Aryan habitation 98
It may be further added that OLDENBERG has almost com pletely overlooked many distinctive characteristics of Rudra&rsquo;s personality and character mentioned above He does not, for instance, care to say anything about Rudra&rsquo;s association with the religious cults of the yraryas, the brahmacārins, and the munis Nor has he anything to say about Rudra&rsquo;s being denied any place in the hierarchical Vedic ritual Rudra&rsquo;s is obviously a complex personality What OLDENBERG has done is to lay stress or just one aspect of it and present only that aspect as representing the whole character of that god Though, therefore, it has to be conceded that OLDENBERG has proceeded in the right direction and has thus prepared the ground for a correct understanding of the Rudra problem, his theory as a whole cannot be regarded as acceptable
In bis comprehensive monograph on Rudra, ARDMAN seems to follow the lead given by OLDENBERG # Like the German scholar, ARBMAN also believes - and, as pointed out above, quite tightly-that Rudra is not the god of thunderstorm as suggested by a majority of Western Vedists Nor for the matter of that 15 he a god connected with any phenomenon of nature ARDMAN regards Rudra as an unbeavenly product of lower mythology bis original character Rudra is according to that scholar, au earthly, dedooniacal, fearful godloo who has originated from the

primitive concepts of death and its fears This ancient god, who had presumably been in existence already in the pre Vedic times, continued, throughout the ancient cultural history, to influence &ndash; Indeed, to dominate the popular religion of ancient India and was, according to ARDMAN, adopted in the later Vedic tradition, almost in his onginal character Out of the two Rudras, who are supposed to have been represented in the Veda, the Rudra of the later Vedic tradition is not, as is generally assumed, a direct descendant of the Rgvedic Rudra, implying, so to say, the decline of deterioration of the latter Actually he is more akin to the original primitive non Vedic Rudra and must be presumed to belong to the unbroken line of development of that concept in popular religion culminating in the figure of the epic Siva The Rgvedic Rudra, on the other hand, represents What may be characterised as an artificial side. growth of that continuous line of development It will be thus seen that, by drawing pointed attention to Rudra&rsquo;s original non Vedic character and to the unbroken continuity of the Rudra concept in popular religion, ARBMAN has made a distinct advance over OLDENBERG&rsquo;s hypothesis But, by characterising Rudra essentially as a god of death, be too must be said to have made the same mistake as OLDENBERG, Damely, to emphasize only one of the aspects – though, in this case perhaps a major aspect of Rudra&rsquo;s complex personality and character ARB MAN has, for instance, not been able satisfactorily to correlate the various distinctive features of Rudra&rsquo;s personality, mentioned above, with his character as the god of death He has also not succeeded in explaining the significance of the apparent contradic tion in Rudra&rsquo;s character Why should a death god, as such, be regarded as both benevolent and malevolent? Further, ARB MAN&rsquo;S suggestion that the popular god, sıva, represents the culmination of the origual Rudra concept cannot be substantiated from the culture historical point of view Again, Siva also can. not be regarded exclusively as a god of death

on Rudra&rsquo;s association with death and its horror than on any other aspect of his complex personality and character This has, indeed, been done to such an extent that a casual study of that Veda would make one feel inclined to regard Rudra as the Vedic death god It would, for instance, appear from the Rgvedic references that Rudra&rsquo;s bolt (IT 33 3) is certainly not the thunderbolt, as HOPKINS and others believe, 101 but must be understood merely as the imagery of sickness and death HOP KINS also thinks that Rudra&rsquo;s sarakas, referred to in II 33 10, actually represent the gleaming bolt, regarded as an arrow of his bow&rdquo; 102 This is, indeed, unnecessary For, a critical study of this reference taken in conjunction with several others, would make it amply clear that these sāyakas are just the death bringing arrows shot by Rudra, the sender of disease and death To I 114 10, Rudra&rsquo;s missiles are openly characterised as &ldquo;cowslaying and manslaying The commonest prayer to Rudra is that he should not slay or injure the worshippers, and their parents, chuldren, nien, cattle, horses, etc (I 114 7-8) Rudra is often implored to spare the worshipper, his family, and his property (II 331, VI 28 7, VII 462-4). On the otlier hand, Rudra is invoked to prostrate others&rsquo; with his fatal shafts ( II 33 11, 14) In IV 36, Rudra himself is directly called nrhan, the slayer of men Rudra s character as the god of death is further concretised, so to say, in later Veda In the AV, for instance, Rudra is very signin cantly described as assailing his victims with diseases like fever, cough, etc (XI 2 22, 26, also VI 90, 93) His doubles, Bhava and Sarva, also are addressed in that Veda as gods of death They are implored not to leave the bodies to be eaten up by wolves etc (XI 2 2) In still later Vedic literature also Rudra&rsquo;s passion for killing men and animals becomes equally evident Rudra is characterised as seeking to slay men, 103 and his hosts are described as attacking men and beasts with disease and death ***

confirming that god&rsquo;s character as god of death 212 In course of time, Rudra, indeed, came to be connected with several objects which were believed to bring ill luck and death 113
But by far the most significant point in this connection 19 Rudra&rsquo;s association with the Maruts In view of what has been said about the Maruts elsewherellt it is now hardly necessary to dilate upon the character of these dividities As indicated above, it is possible to mark out certain distinct stages in the evolution of the mythology relating to the Maruts It may be presumed that the Maruts originally belonged to what may be called the
popular' order of gods In RV VII 58 I. we have a clear reference to the fact that the Maruts were originally associated with Nirrti and were only later raised to heaven from the region of death They are accordingly not infrequently represented as evil, dark beings (1 39 8, 171 1, 172 2, VII 56 9, 17, 58 5) The popular character of the Maruts seems to be suggested also by their peculiarly close association with the asiattha tree and is further reflected in some aspects of the Vedic ritual In the prausthapada rite, for instance, a sacrificial offering is first made to Indra, and then, quite separated from it, a bali is offered to the Maruts 110 In that connection, the Grhyasūtra refers to a śrul text, according to which the Maruts, among the gods, are the eaters of son sacrificial offerings 117 According to the SI (IV 52 16 ), the raw foetus of the cow of Mitrāvarunau is offered to the Maryts 118 While recommending this, the Kānva re

of the Brāhmana says &ldquo;Common people are eaters of raw flesh and the Maruts are common people&rdquo; 118 It is further significant that one of the offerings in connection with the cujana is to be made to the Maruts in the forest 120 Indeed, in some passa ges,121 the Maruts are actually represented as being anti ritual They are also said to be capable of blocking the sacrficcr&rsquo;s passage to the heaven 19
The original, popular, non divine character of the Maruts can thus be clearly established Not only this It is also possible to represent that character more specifically It has been already pointed out that the offerings to the Maruts, like those to the Pitars, are not accompanied by the sacred siala utterance Again, the Maruts are sometimes characterised as being antagonistic to progeny 128 But perhaps the most suggestive pojot in this context is that the Maruts are often represented as birds It may be recalled that according to the primitive mythological thought, the spirits of the dead often wander about in the form of birds 1:4 The popular divinities, the Maruts, must therefore, have originally been connected in a special manner, with the ideology relating to death and the spirits of the dead The derivation of the word, marut, from the root mar (== to die ) suggested by KUHN&rdquo; would confirm this hypothesis 136 When in the course of the evolution of the Vedic mythology, it became necessary for the Vedic

poet priests to include the popular pre-Aryan god, Rudra, in the Vedic pantheon, they seem to have cmphasised, for obvious rea sons only one of the many aspects of the complex personality of that god And the fact that, at this stage in the evolution of the Vedic mythology, the Maruts came to be associated with Rudra in a particularly close relationship clearly implies that the aspect of Rudra&rsquo;s character emphasized by the Vedic poet priests must have been akın to the original character of the Maruts In other words, Rudra came to be regarded principally as the god of death and the Maruts, who originally represented the spirits of the dead, came to be associated with him as his hosts 137
There are also certain other points which would further con firm the bypothesis that, in the Veda, it is Rudra&rsquo;s character as a god of death that is particularly empbasızed The Taittirija. Samhita (II 1 7 1 ff narrates the legend of vasarkära breaking open the head of gayatri On that occasion, we are told, the gods took the various juices 15suing out of that head But Rudra chose only the blood Indeed, blood seems to have been a favou

The word, rudra, suggests that Rudra was essentially a red god 130 He is described as being arusa (1 114 5), babhn (11 335), babhlusa, làmra, aruna, vilohita, and milaloluita (TS IV 5 1 ) In the primitive thinking, the red colour is closely associated with deatlı 131 It may be pointed out in this connection that Śiva also is connected with death - perhaps 10 a more marked manner Śiva lives in the smasana, wears a garland of skulls, and is fond of bloody sacnfices The association of that god with serpents is quite well known In view of the fact, therefore that Siva is just a double of Rudra, all the above mentioned characteristics of the former go to confirin the latter&rsquo;s character as a god of death Incidentally it may be here pointed out that the word, $na, also originally meant&rsquo;red'

He has hus wild army and is usually accompanied by wild wolves Like Rudra, again Odın assumes different forms at different times These points of similarity are, however, to be Tegarded only as incidental upon the one essential characteristic which both these gods share, namely, close connection with death 133 Odin is the leader of the departed souls He is descri. bed as receiving human sacrifices, and is frequently associated with the Walhall (that is, the hall of the dead) Rudra has many points in common also with the Greek death god, Hecate A frequent reference is made to Hecate&rsquo;s demonic, deathly traits. Like Rudra, the Greek death god also moves about at the cross roads and during the night 194 It must, however, be emphasized at this stage that these points of agreement cannot be construed, as they are by SCHROEDER, 135 to indicate that the concepts of Rudra, Odin Wodan, Hecate, etc, are all derived from a common Indo European prototype of a death god 136 As has been already pointed out, Rudra cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be

regarded as a god of Aryan (or Todo European) origin His oogipal character is essentially non-Aryan In primitive think ing, certain peculiar features must have been universally attributed to a death god It is to this common primitive heritage that the points of similarity shown by Rudra, Odin Vodan, Hecate, etc, are to be traced back 137 As a matter of fact, Rudra, more than any other god, has retained in his character the essential features of a death god of the primitive, ruder type He is, indeed, more akin to the primitive corpse eating demons of death A reference may again be made, in this context, to OLDENBERG&rsquo;s hypothc $1$'*' that Rudra represents the Old Man of the Mountains As has been pointed out above, this hypothesis takes into account only one of the many aspects of that god s complex personality But it certainly confirms the character of Rudra as a death god For, the close connection between the Old Man of the Moun tains and the spirits of the dead is a well established concept in primitive ideology
Attention needs to be drawn, in this context, to one very significant feature of the primitive gods connected with death and the spirits of the dead These gods were, no doubt, greatly feared on account of their main activity of causing death and disease among men and cattle But there was also a distinctly beneficent side to their activity Those gods could overpower humanity by means of disease and death but they also possessed the power to cure diseases and prevent death According to the primitive way of thinking, one, who possesses the power to do evil, necessarily possesses the power also to ward off evil 139 This way of thinking is reflected also in the character and activity of the primitive priest magician medicineman This primitive worthy commanded the power as much to bless as to curse, as much to cure as to victimise There is, again, ample evidence available in the primi

tive religions to show that, in the course of their wild hosting cxpcditions, the god of death and his hosts, which consisted of the spirits of the dead, bestowed fertility on land, animals, and human beings &ldquo;10 One need not, therefore, be surprised at the chasm 11 the two sides of the character of Rudra, who is represented both as a malevolent demon and a benci olent god
It is necessary to refor, at this stage, to one more im. portant point relating to Rudra&rsquo;s character as a god of death It is usually beliesed that Yama is the proper and original god of death in the Veda But this view has elsewhere been shown to be quite unwarranted 111 It seems that, in the early Vedic pantheon, there had not been cs olycd any one single god of death, as such, though several minor divinities might haie been connected with death When, as will be shown in the sequel, the Vedic poet priests were required, under pressure of circumstances, to icclude the foreign Rudra in their hieratic pantheon, they emphasized that cod&rsquo;s character as a dcath-god and officially began to view him as such It is, indeed, from this point of view that Rudra may be regarded as the first regular god
In the Vedic pantheon But, since the entire concept relating to Rudra was foreign to Vedic ideology, the character of Rudra did not come to be clearly defined and the emphasis appeared to be continuously shifting from one aspect of his character to another. That is why Rudra cannot be said to have been represented in the Veda as a god of death either exclusively or consistently the same reason would account for the fact that certain potions, which are conventionally associated with the concept of the death-god in Vedic religious thought and practice, are not found connected with Rudra For instance, Rudra described as belonging to the north, though the south is the quarter which is traditionally believed to be presided over by the god of death Similarly, offerings are made to Rudra with le sacred utterance, si aha, and not siadha Again, Rudra is in 10

way directly connected with the Pitars, nor is he anywhere described as showing the departing souls the way to immortality As against this, when, in the course of the peculiar evolution of the Yama mythology 112 Yama came to be regarded as a full fledged god of death, these conventional features of the character of a god of death were connected with him
From the foregoing discussion it would now become clear that Rudra was essentially different from the normal hieratic Vedic gods that he obviously belonged to a milieu which was foreign to the Vedic poet priests, that the Vedic poet priests must have included him in the Vedic pantheon under pressure of circumstances and, therefore, reluctantly and almost under protest, and that, as the result of the peculiar way in which the Vedic poet priests reacted to this forcign influence, Rudra came to be represented in the Veda mainly, though not exclusively, as a god of death this latter being indeed but one aspect of his origi nal complex character One, however, gets a few glimpses of the Original complex personality and character of that god from a few stray and incidental references to him in the early Veda Not only this It is actually seen that the origioal character of that god reasserted itself in the later Vedic and post Vedic age and that Rudra in the form of Rudra Śiva began to receive increasing recognition as the great god (Mahadeva ) in later times
On the strength of all the evidence which is available in this connection and which will be produced below, one would be certainly justified in presuming that Rudra represents but the Vedic version of a popular proto Indian god whose cult must have spread far and wide in this country As a matter of fact this proto Indian god seems to have been represented in different forms among different proto Indian peoples in different localities Each of these forms may have perhaps emphasized some specific characteristic of that god, but all the forms can be shown to have been derived from one and the same common concept so that one Torm shows unmistakable essential similarity to another When

the hieratic Vedic religion came into contact with this popular proto Indian religious cult it could not resist the overpowerug influence of the latter The Vedic poet priests, however, reacted to the pressure of this indigenous religious cult in the same way as they did to other popular influences They did, accordingly, adopt this foreign element into the mechanised and ntualised religious pattern which they had evolved, but, whule doing so, they suppressed such aspects of that cuit as were particularly revoltug to what may be characterised as their sophisticated hieratic out look and emphasized only that feature of the character of the god presiding over that cult, which they regarded as the least uo Vedic and which they could somehow fit into their religio-mythological ideology without having fundamentally to disturb its basic pattern and character As there does not seem to have been evolved any regular death god in the Vedic pantheon, thc Vedic poet priests officially began to look upon Rudra as their god of death. Of course, as has been pointed out above, Rudra did pot, for obvious reasons, continue to be represented as a death-god either exclosi vely or consistently throughout the Veda
One of the strik og features of this popular proto Indian gou seems to be that he was regarded, at least by some proto-Indian peoples, as a &lsquo;red&rsquo; god This fact is, indeed, very significant so far as the essential character of that god and the religious pracht ces associated with him are concerned As will be pointed out ia the sequel, it is possible to presume that this proto-Indian god was regarded as a red god because he was actually represented as being red in colour In order to make this point clear it w be very helpful, at thus stage, to draw attention to one of tho essential points of difference between the Vedic religion on the one hand and the pre-Vedic proto Indian religion on the other As is well known, the Vedic literature reflects the religious ided logy and practices of the Vedic people fairly faithfully &ldquo;13 Unlot

Sufficient evidence has been produced in respect of the religious practices of the ancient Dravidians to enable us to assume that one of the commonest forms of the proto-Indian worship must have consisted of communal offerings of animals, such as buffalos, lambs, etc., to their gods.&quot;:1 Raw flesh of these animals was usually offered to those demon-divinities. Attention may be drawn, in this context, to the Sīlagara rite dedicated to the Vedic Rudra - a rite which stands more or less isolated from the other frauta rites. The points of similarity between the proto-Indian animal sacrifice 67 and the Vedic Sūlagara are such as to make the conclusion irresistible that both Rudra and the Sūlagara rite must have originally belonged to the proto-Indians and must have forced their way into the Vedic religious complex.153
But far more significant, from our point of view, than the offering of the flesh of the animals to the demon.divinities is another aspect of the proto-lodian form of worship, namely, pouring out of the blood of the animals, which are sacrificed, upon the crude icons which are supposed to be infused with the
prescace' of the gods, It is this aspect which must have been responsible for the proto-Indian god being regarded as a red god. The name of the ancient Dravidian god, namely, Śiva, which means &lsquo;red&rsquo;, can thus be very well linked up with the form of

worship which must have been most common in respect of that god The Vedic version of this ancient god, namely, Rudra, also bears a name, which means &lsquo;red&rsquo;, though, in his case, attempts seem to have been made to suppress the original association of his redness with blood offerings and to emphasize quite a different kind of association 154
While we are on the subject of the blood offering 6 we may refer to one or two other incidental but closely connected matters Just as, by way of one of the main features of the proto Indian worship, the worshippers besmeared the icon of the divinity with the blood of the sacrificed animal, they also sometimes besmeared their own bodies with that ritual blood in the belief that, by dong so, they, on the one hand, protected themselves against the attack of the evil spirits and, on the other, won for themselves ever new magic power 158 Besides this, there is enough evidence available, on the strength of which we may assume that &lsquo;the proto-Indian worshippers also partook of the blood offerings, in one form or another, as a part of a communal sacramental feast
This peculiar feature of the proto Indian worship, namely, besmearing the icon of the demon divinity with blood (and there by concretely making that divinity look &lsquo;red&rsquo;) has survived in the Hindu worship also, albeit in a very much modified form Broadly speaking, one may characterise homa (that is to say, the offering of oblations to gods through fire and in the accompaniment of ritual formulas – those gods not being actually present in the form of idols and it being believed that the oblations are conveyed to them by fire) as the most essential feature of the Vedic Aryan worship This Vedic way of worship must be clearly distin

guished from the popular Hindu way of worship, called püja. A critical consideration of the word, nūjā, would be particularly illuminating at this stage. In an excellent paper, published a few years ago, CHARPENTIER bas dealt with the etymology of that word and the concept denoted by at 157 It has been pointed out that neither the noun, pūjā, nor the verb, pūjay ati, which latter is clearly a secondary form, occurs in the RV or any other early Vedic text. At the same time, these words are not infrequently used by Yaska and Panini. The natural conclusion, therefore, which one is inclined to draw from these facts is that the word, půjā, which must have originally belonged to some proto-Indian language, was adopted in Sanskrit about the time of the rise of the Vedāngas. At the time of Yasha, that word seems to have already come into vogue in Brahmanic speech. Attempts have been made, though not at all successfully, to demonstrate the Jado-European character of the word, pūjā, by connecting it linguistically with some word in an IE language, BARTHO LOMAE, for instance, has suggested158 that that word may be connected with ap baxšūdan (=to show favour; to forgive ), pr. baxšajad, these two latter being derived from an ancient *pukšia— As indicated by CHARPENTIER, this suggestion of BARTHOLOMAE&rsquo;s is neither phonetically nor semasiologically convincing,159 One is, therefore, irresistibly led to conclude that pūjā is a word of non-IE origin.160 So far as the etymology of that word is concerned, GUNDERT261 and KITTELIC seem to have hit

the mark when they suggested that it has to be derived from a proto Dravidian root, which occurs as pūçu ja Tamil and pūsu in Kan nada The original proto-Dravidian root means &ldquo;to besmear&rdquo;,&rdquo; to paste on &ldquo;, &quot; to paint over &quot; 163 It would now become clear that, in the procedure of worship called pūjā, the most essential consti tuent was the besmearing of the icon The pūjā as it is commonly practised, consists of fifteen 164 or sixteen 16 items. A critical examination of all these items would seem to show that the item which could be said to be the most primitive, the most basic, and the most peculiar was the besmearing of the idol with coloured salves It is, therefore, not surprising that this entire form of worship should have derived its name from its most primitive, most basic, and most peculiar feature, 186
On the strength of the evidence produced above we may now conclude that both the word pijā and the peculiar form of worship denoted by that word were essentially proto-Indian in character. We may further assume that, already in the pre-Vedic times,
163. It u an interesting linguistic phenomenon that the Sanskrit word, paja (= worship), which is connected with the ancient Tamil word, pacu (to besznear ), reappears in Tamil - of course, secondarily - as prece (=worship). It may further be incidentally powoted out that GUNDERT and KITTEL regard the proto-Dravidian root (from which Sanskrit pa is to be derived ) also as the basis of the Sanskrit word, pusta (=model, image) It is well know that, in the preparation of a model or an image, besmcaring and pasting play an important rolc. [THIEME, JORM 27, 1-16, has recently suggested that the Aryan origin of 978 is highly probable Hc connects the word with the root prc (cf parka in madhuparka). According to THIEME, paja originally mant hospitable reception&rsquo;.

166 In coursc of tunc, various modificd forms of the besmearing of the idols with coloured substances must have come into yogue Thc practice of bestcaring sacred stumps, stones, and images with red Icad mixed with oil u cvidenced all over India. This fact would show that the basic forta of proto Indian worship had become almost universal throughout this country.

pājā, in its basic form, had spread over almost all parts of India, though it was only at a much later stage in the cultural history of ancient India that Brahmanism adopted both the word, pūjā, and the peculiar form of worship denoted by it into its culture complex This must have happened at a time when serious efforts were required to be made to consolidate, popularize, and revitalize the Vedic way of life and thought, which was in the danger of becoming more or less completely extinct as the result of the ever-growing strength and appeal of certain non-Vedic religious cults The Vedāngas, among other texts, constitutc the literary monuments of this great movement wluch had been laun ched for the purpose of the resuscitation of Vedic culture Presumably one of the features of that great movement was the assimilation of several proto Indian elements into the Vedic way of life and thoughtSome kind of iconism and pūja — both essential aspects of the prota Indian religion - seem to have been adopted into the Brahmanic religion about this time, obviously in very much modified forms 267 This would explain why the word pūjà occurs and idols arc mentioned, for the first time, in the Jiterary works of Yáska and Panini, which, broadly speaking, belong to the Vedanga period
What, however, is most significant from our point of view is the truc implication of the besmearing of the icon, which is 100. cated by the word pūjā From what has been said above about the offerings made to the proto-Indian gods there should be little doubt that the besmearing of the icon, usually with red sub stances, is only a substitute for actually besmearing it with blood The offering of blood, which was poured over the icon, propitiated the demon divinity and protected the worshipper against its malevolent designs It is suggested that, according to the primitive way of thinking, when the worsbipper further applied a portion of that blood to some part or parts of his own body, he thereby established a kind of blood relationship with the divinity The proto Indian root form, from which the

VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
Sanskrit word nūjā was derived, must have thus denoted the besmearing with blood of the proto-lodian god As the result of this blood besmcariog the proto-Indian god must have actually looked red and must have, therefore, been called Siva, the red god Presumably, in course of time, some proto Indian peoplc either developed a kind of abhorrence for the actual offering of blood and the besmearing of the idol with it or found those things increasingly impracticable They could not, however, entirely give up this basic feature of their worship
They, therefore, employed some substitute (pratınıdhı) for blood 10: The word pújā accordingly came to denote the be smearing in general of the idols as an essential item in worship, then the procedure of worship as a whole, and then the idea underlying worship as such It was, perhaps, in this last stage of its semasiological development that the word was adopted in Sanskrit
There is another point to be noted in connection with the siggificance of the redness of the popular proto-Indian god In the primitive way of thought the red colour is often associated with the concepts relating to death, magic, evil omen, swearing, cursing, misfortune, etc This is, indeed, an almost universally accepted association To restrict ourselves, however, to ancient Indian conditions we may refer, in this context, to a rite inten ded for the destruction of enemy, wherein priests, dressed in red robes and wearing red turbans are required to make an offer ing of a blue-red animal 169 This peculiarly detailed procedure is certainly not to be understood as being the result of the usual tendency on the part of the Vedic priests to make even simple thungs elaborate and complicated It has on it an unmistakable imprint of the primitive magical ideology Elsewhere it is enjoia ed that one, who intends practising magic, should offer a
168 It may be pointed out that substitutes were used also in the Brahmapuc sacrifices

red cow to Rudra 10 There are, indeed, quite a number of references in Indian literature in general to the popular belief that a red object seen in a dream portends rnisfortune and death 171 According to a Vedic text,172 a calamity is bound to occur if the sky looks red Just another aspect of this belief, tinged with priestly tendencies, is that, if, in the course of a sacrifice, red lines appear on the sacrificial post, running from right to left, ut is a sure sign that the desired daksınã will not be paid in that sacrifice 173 It is hardly necessary to dilate upon the fact that the popular proto-Indian god and his Vedic version, Rudra, are intrinsically associated with all these concepts implied by the red colour It was, therefore, but natural that the primitive people should have thought of such god as the sed god
In this connection it may be pointed out that the red colour derived some other significance also in the primitive way of think ing On account of its magical associations the red colour was believed to possess the power of warding off evil spirits It may, indeed, be presumed that some followers of the original Rudra cult accordingly painted their bodies red, or put red marks on different parts of their bodies, or put on red robes In the Veda also we come across references such as the one where the use of red thread is prescribed by way of a talisman to guard oneself against evil spirits 174 Incidentally it may be pointed out, in this context, that the blue colour also possesses the same sinister, &ldquo;apotropaeisch&rdquo; character is the red colour We are, for in stance, told in a Vedic text1o5 that blue famcs 15suing out of fire portend death Naturally enough, therefore, the blue colour also

A critical study of the name of the god Rudra would prove particularly illuminating at this stage The word rudra, is usually derived from the root rud, which means to howl” or “to cry&rdquo; It is, indeed, on the strength of this etymology that Rudra 15 generally regarded as the roaring god of tempest However, as indicated above, there is very little evidence in the Veda which would support the hypothesis that Rudra is a storm god The same can be said as regards the hypothesis also referred to above, that the concept of Rudra is the outcome of the minglog to gether of the two concepts of the roaring' storm and the * crackling' fire The derivation of the word rudra from the root rud, indeed, seems to be as old as the Tailtırıya Samhită, though, in that text as well as in the Maitrājani Samhita and the Satapatha Bralimana, the epithet, rudra, derived from the root rud (=to cry) is applied specifically to Agni 177 Yaska has adopted this old etymology for explaining the character of god Rudra 178 Following his usual practice Yasha further connects the word, rudra etymologically with the two roots, tu (= roar) and dru (= speed forth) 179 Sayana, in his commentary on RV I 114 1, derives the word in as many as six different ways 180

Is this a device similar to the more common onc wliereby a pon bicratic god is elevated by artificially associating him with Indra to form a dual diyipity? According to APTE (JCJRI V, 85-92), the original Toot to be thought of in this connection may have actually been a hypothetical rudh (to flow ), some of whose derilatses such as ndhra (blood), lohita ( red), loha ( red pietal), arc mct with in Sanskrit Arte suril er suggests that rudh was deaspirated into rud from which later the word, rudra, can be directly derived [Incidentally it may be pointed out that in Arte&rsquo;s article under reference (P 90 in 6), the present writer seems to be represented as holding the view that Rudra is the Vedic god of death on the strength of the assumption that the word rudra is derned from the root, rud (=to howl) The present writer does beleve that the death god aspect of Rudra s original complex personality is emphasized in the Veda but, as well bave now become clear his belucl is not certaialy based on the etymology mentioned above)

We have seen above that there already existed, in the pre Vedic times, a popular proto Indian god, whose cult had spread far and wide in this country We have further seen that the Vedic Rudra is but an aryanized or brahmanized version of that proto Indian god As has been pointed out above, on account of the peculiar religious practices associated with him, this proto Indian god was, at least among some proto Indian people, regarded as a red god He was actually known as Siva, the red one, among the proto Dravidians There was also another ancient Dravidian god, called Rudhra, whose name also emphasizes his redness 195 It would app-ar that, when, owing to the pressure of circumstances, the Vedic poet priests were required to adopt this proto Indian god into their religious complex, they retained his name, albeit in another form, and called him Rudra, the red one 184 Attention has already been drawn to the essential simi larity in the characters of the Vedic Rudra and the proto Iadian Siva It will now become clear that, as a matter of fact, even the names, Rudra and Siva, are synonymous 187 A very interest ing linguistic phenomenon, however, seems to have occurred in connection with the word, fa, so far as the Vedic Isterature is concerned As has been shown above, the god Rudra was re presented in the Veda mainly as a fearful god of death the other essential features of the complex personality and character

of the proto-Indian god, from whom he is derived, having been, perhaps purposefully, suppressed by the hieratic Vedic poct. priests. This character of Rudra seems to have rendered his namnc almost a taboo. This is clcarly indicated by, among other things, the facts that the direct mention of his name is to be avoided, that his name is not included in the list of formal in vocations at a sacrifice, and that the formulas containing his name are usually employed only at expiatory rites.188 There must have, thereforc, naturally arisen, in course of time, a tendency to refer to Rudra in a euphemistic manner - indeed, with a word, which implicd just the opposite of what the name, Rudra, originally implied 119 Such a word was $110, which in Sanskrit, meant &ldquo;gracious,&rdquo; &ldquo;benevolent.&rdquo; The later Brahmanic thinkers must have hit upon this specific word as the result of the operation of what may be callcd folk-etymology. The Vedic word, riidra, and the ancient Dravidian word, sna, were actually synonymous, both meaning &lsquo;red&rsquo;, and, in a sense, denoted one and the same popular proto-indian god The word, sna, seems to have been latcr adopted in Brahmaaic literature, again as an epithet or as another name of Rudra, but now in another sense &ndash; that is to say, by way of euphemism 1.

Dravidian siva ( red) now came to be understood in the sense of Sanskrit śnia (= gracious, benevolent) 191 The name Siva as such seems to be unknown to Vedic, Brahmanic, and even old Buddhistic literature in the Rgveda, for instance, the word, Śiva, is employed exclusively as an adjective, and, only in one passage, as an epithet of Rudra 192 It is only in the Svetaśvatara Upanı sad that the word seems to have been first used as a proper noun Thereafter, however, the word, śrva, began to be regarded as as much a proper name as Rudra 183
Another aspect of the popular pre Vedic proto-Indian god, whose impact on the Vedic Aryan religion gave rise to the concept of Rudra, is represented in the Indus Valley religion In view of the fact that extensive literature relating to this subject has already been published,194 not much need be said about it here Atten tion may, however, be drawn to certain points which are parti cularly pertinent to the line of thought indicated above To begin with, it should be noted that, unlike the Vedic religion, but like the proto Dravidian Siva religion described above, the Indus religion is essentially iconic The gods, goddesses, and other divine objects in the Indus religion are concretely represented through pictorial and plastic art The large number of seals, sealings, and statuettes, unearthed in the Indus Valley, testify unmistakably to the high level of plastic anthropomorphism which

those people must have developed Tbis idolatrous character of the Indus religion at once establishes its affinity to the proto Dravidian Siva religion (in which pūjā played an important role ) as against the Vedic Aryan religion and confirms the assumption of a more or less uniform proto-Indian rcligious cult having spread far and wide in this country in the pre-Vedic tunes Com ing now to more specific things, we must first take into considera tion the famous Mohenjodaro scal,195 which represents a figure, IR yogic posture.

There can be hardly any doubt that the posture in which the figure on the Mohenjodaro seal is represented, is connected with Joga We have already shown above that the Vedic Rudra also shows distinct affinities to yoga and the cults allied to it 198 As a matter of fact this feature of Rudras personality completely isolates him from the other Vedic gods A study of the early Veda would make it abundantly clear that the concepts relating to yoga are quite foreign to it It has been pointed out above that homa must be said to be the most distinctive characteristic of the Vedic religious practice It has been further pointed out that as against the Vedic homa the pre Vedic proto Indian religious practice was mainly characterised by balı on the one hand and
her We may now point to joga as the third feature of the pre Vedic proto Indian religious cult and practice, which distioguishes it from the Vedic homa cult The close affinity between the three cults with which Rudra is shown above to have been closely associated namely, the vraty a-cult the brahmacarın cult and the muni-cult on the one hand and the yoga cult of the Iodus religion on the other is too patent to need any elaboration This affinity then necessarily establishes the affinity between the Vedic Rudra and the god of the Indus religion represented in the yogic posture There is sufficient evidence to show that like several other features of the original Rudra cult the joga and the allsed practices also were viewed with disfavour by the protagonists of the hieratic Vedic religion In a Vedic passage,
198 One cannot therefore argue as CHAUDHURI (Op 6 ) has done that the Ved c Rudra is not an ascet c god that Sivas associat on with yoga dates only from the cpc age and that the yog - posture of the figure represented on the scal e indicat ve of d vin ly in general and pot of any specific god CHAUDHURI would rather conacct this mode of representation with the later representation of thr Buddha.

for instance, Indra, the chicf god of the oficial Vedic religion, 19 represented as being antagonistic to the jails 187 in another passage that god is said to have actually killed the jails and fed the wolies with them 100 Asindicated above, the followers of the vralya , the brohniacārın, and the muni-cults did not adhere to the way of life and thought prescribed by the mechanised and ritua Jised religion of the Vedic post-priests Toronc thing they were essentially niragni, that is to say, they had no faith in the clicacy of the Vedic ritual of which fire was the centre As against 10, they had developed, on the onc hand, peculiar practics of joga which helped them to attain magical and miraculous powers and, on the other, certain orgiastic practices, which facilitated what may be called scligious ecstacy Again, those jogins and jails seem to hasc rcgarded isolation from normal social life as a sine qua non of truly spiritual life This becomes clear from the peculiar ways of the rat, as, the bralımacarins, and the munis, which arc hinted at in the AV and the RV and which are chiracterised by tendencies towards rcnunciation, austerities, and wandering mendicancy Thesc thcir ways further confirm the distinction between the Rudra cult and the Vedic religion, which latter is cssentially a householder s religion ?

The fact that the phallus of the figure on the Indus Valley seal is prominently exposed connects the Indus Valley god not only with the epic Siva, who is often represented with the raised phallus,203 but, as indicated above, also with the Vedic Rudra, though, in this latter case, indirectly, that is to say, through the vālyas (some of whom are described as samanica medhra) and the brahmacārın (who is clearly characterised as brhacchepa) An almost unbroken continuity is thus established from the proto Indian Sıva to the epic Sıva - the Vedic Rudra being, as it were, an offshoot in the direct line of development but, at the same time, representing a significant intermediate stage It is well known that a large number of objects resem bling phallus as also of ringstones, which are rightly supposed to represent the yoni, have been discovered in the Indus Valley Existence of phallus worship as an important religious cult in the Indus Valley is hereby clearly indicated Now if the two facts, namely, that the phallus of the yogin is prominently ex posed on the Indus Valley seal and that the phallus worship as a religious cult is evidenced to have spread extensively in the Indus Valley, are properly coordinated, one would be naturally led to the conclusion that, even in the proto Indian religion of the Indus Valley, the worship of the yogin Siva and the linga worship were closely associated with each other it may, indeed, be presumed that, even in those early times, the principal Indus Valley god, Siva, was actually represented in two forms that of the human male with raised phallus and that of the detached phallus by

itself.394 Among some of the essential features of the original Rudra-Siva, which the hieratic Vedic poet-priests must have tendentiously suppressed while adopting that god into their offi cial pantheon, was this intrinsic association of that god with thc phallus-cult As in the case of the yarıs, the attitude of the Vedic poet priests vis-a-vis the proto-Indian phallus-vorshippers also was positively antagonistic This 15 clearly evidenced by the fact that, in two passages of the RV (VII 21 S, X 99 3), the enemies of the Vedic Aryans are openly dubbed as seśna derāh (= worshippers of the phallus) At this stage, attention may be drawn to one more point It is a well established

204 That, in historical times, Siva is represented in these two forms us too well known to nccd emphasis It Is, however, interesting to notc, in this connec tion, that VATS kes in an oblong terracotta saling discovered in the Indus Valley (Op al, 129-30 p! xcull, 303 ) the figure of Siva represented with the three symbols with which he must have been, cren then, very closely associated, namely, the bull, the trident, and the phallus So far as the representation of Sıva, in hurdan form, is concerned, A Grosir ( Opal) points out that not all varieties of Sıva images, in historical times, have the ordhoa luriga fcaturc At the same time almost all the Sıva images found in Eastern India ( Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, etc.) show this characteristic without exception Can it, therefore, be asumcd, on the strength of this evidence, that the influence of the Indus Valley Sıva worshippers was felt mort direcly in Lastem India? Is it possible to suggest that the Rudra-Siva cult (and lic cults of the tydlyas and the brahmatarins) prevailed more particularly among the Pricyas ? N M CLAUDIILAT (Opct, 177-78) also suggests, of course on quite differcot grounds, that the traditions of the Indus religion were more directly represented among the people among whom Buddhist later flour whed (that 1 to say among the people of Eastern India) So fy as the relation of Buddhism to the Siva-cult is concerned, CILARTEXTIER (H ZKU XXIII, 151-79) completely discountenances the possibility of the early Buddhists haviag been the direct inheritors of the Indus Valley religious tradition According to that scholar, the region which was superseded in Magadha by Duddhism must have been the Sıva religion Inold Buddhist literaturo there is no direct mention of Rudra. Ein On the strength of considerable curcumstantial evidence, however, CHARPEXTIER concludes that dra is the Buddhist representatise of Rudra.

anthropological fact that phallus-worship, which has, indeed, prevailed in all primitive communities, is closely connected with the fertility cult 205 That, in one of his aspects, the Vedic Rudra is regarded as a god of fertility has been already indicated above Incidentally it may be recalled that the hieratic Vedic poet priests often looked at such fertility-gods and their cults with some kind of disfavour 206
While we are on the subject of phallus-worship, we may point out that there is sufficient evidence to show that in India, in very early times, this religious cult must have spread far and wide It has, for instance, been suggested by VRR DIKSHITAR that the Neolithic people in South India were primarily worshippers of linga 207 He produces, in this connection, the evidence of Kapa gallu hill in Bellary district, where one notices a linga together with a bull in a crouching position 208 The similarity of this

206 Sec “Vişnu in the Veda', published elsewhere in this Volume A GHOSH ( Opat), to whom the connection of the Vedic Rudra with phallıcısm does not seem to have become clear, tries to suggest that the Indus Sıva cult came to be linked up with the Vedic Rudra-cult through the evidence of cllipsoid stones In the case of the Siva-cult, those stones represented phallıc symbols of that god, while, in the case of the Vedic Rudra, who, accord. ing to GHOSI, was a storm god they represented thunderbolt stones It will, however, be realised that such a round about linking up of the two cults 18 not at all necessary Besides it has beca duly shown that Rudra is not a storm god Though T M P MAHADEVAN (OP a) admits the connection between Sıva and the linga cult he is reluctant to accept the fact that the liniga us a pballic symbol He, therefore, makes the curious suggestion that the linga might be representing a column of light' or otherwisc a peg (Radutarı in Tamil -a form which Siva is supposed to have taken QUARITCIT WALES *peaks ( Op¢) of the Yaksa s stone bevog replaced by the linga of the carthly origin IR SUBRAMANIAN ( Alat Un j I. part 2) regards linga as a symbol of the ancestor worship However, as pointed out by G RAO (Op al II, 1, 55-57) the peculiar shape of the langa at Gudumallam, hulattur, and kudumiyamalai hardly leave any doubt as to the linge representing the phallus

representation to the one on the oblong terracotta seal noticed by VATS (Op. cit.) is, indeed, most significant.209
On either side of the figure on the Indus Valley seal are shown four animals; and two deer are seen standing beneath the throne. Taken in combination with the evidence produced above this peculiar feature of the Indus Valley god would definitely con firm the close affinity of that god to the epic Pasupati Siva on the one hand, and the Vedic Rudra on the other.210 It may, how ever, be argued that the animals represented on the Indus Valley seal cannot be characterised as pašu in the usual sense of the word. In the Veda, for instance, the word pašu usually connotescattle It may be further argued that the animals represented on the seal are bardly associated with Rudra-Siva. In this connection, it should be, first of all, remembered that the connotation of the word pasu is not always necessarily restricted to domestic ani. mals.211 Besides, it is not unlikely that the animals represented on the Indus Valley scal possessed some peculiar significance in the religious cult of the proto-Indians; and, on account of such cult relations, specifically these animals were regarded as representing the animal kingdom in general It should also be remembered that, so far as the Vedic Rudra is concerned, his character as Pasupatı has to be understood from various points of view.

indicated above, Rudra is frequently celebrated in the Veda as a god of mountains and wild forests. It is in this aspect of his personality that he must have been associated with wild animals, some of which are shown on the Indus seal.212 The Vedic Rudra is an archer and a hunter and his connection with deer is variously reflected in Vedic and epic legends :13 It may also be presumed that, in the proto-Indian mythology, as in the classical mythology, the buffalo was regarded as the vchicle of the god of death,311 and that Rudra Siva, as god of death, was connected with animal from very carly times. Further, as pointed out above, buffalos were among the animals offered by the proto-Dravidians to their divinities All this may account for the appearance of a buffalo on the Indus Valley seal.
There must have been another reason as well why Rudra was referred to as Pasupati. Rudra, as god of death, brought disease and death to men and cattic. But, as pointed out above, he was also supposed to possess the power to cure disease and prevent death. It was with a view to making Rudra bring this latter side of his power into operation that he was flatteringly - and in a sense, euphemistically called Pasupatı. It seems that originally Rudra was Pasupati in the sense that he was the lord of wild beasts. When, however, the Rudra-cult came to be adapted into the

religion of the people, who had begun to lead some sort of settled life, cattle and other domestic animals were committed to the charge of that god 215 The Pasupati aspect of Rudra&rsquo;s character can also be connected with the cults of fertility and vegetation - cuits, Rudra&rsquo;s connection with which is cstablished on other grounds also
The remaining two features of the Indus Valley god, namely, his three faces and his pair of horns, are not evidenced so far as the Vedic Rudra is concerned, though we find them in the epic Sıva As has been repeatedly pointed out above, certain features of the original Rudra Siva were purposefully suppressed by the Vedic poet priests Curiously enough however, DR BHANDAR KAR,218 thinks that the three faces of the proto Siva are preserved in the form of the Vedic Rudra&rsquo;s epithet, tryambaka But, as will be shown later, the sigpificance of that epithet seems to have been quite different 917 One or two observations may, however, be made, in this context, about the two horns of the Indus Valley god It is suggested that, in the representation of the epic Siva, those horos assumed the form of the insula or trident The trisula, in turn, is regarded as the symbol of the thunderbolt And as the god of storn, the Vedic Rudra is

connected with the thunderbolt The Vedic Rudra is thus linked up with the pair of horns of the Indus Valley god in a round about manner Such linking up, however, is, as indicated above, based on a wrong premise It may be added that the horns of the Indus Valley god seem to have assumed the form rather of the crescent moon on the forehead of the epic Siva As regards the significance of this pair of horns the following hypothesis may be hazarded The purpose of the horns cannot be, as suggested by some scholars,&ldquo;18 merely to give the figure a distinctive look and raise it above the normal human beings It is more likely that, at some stage in the evolution of the proto Indian Siva, the bull came to be closely associated with him as his special animal or as his vehicle As pointed out elsewhere, sometimes a god is actually represented in the form of his special animal 210 So the frequently represented Indus Valley bull may, after all, have been a symbol of the proto Indian Siya himself
There is also evidence in the primitive mythology to show that sometimes some characteristic feature of the animal of a parti cular god is transferred to that god This would explain the two horns of the Indus Valley Siva Many of the followers of the pre Vedic proto Indian Sıva cuit also may have used the symbol of their cult, panely, a pair of horns, as their own symbol One would, accordingly, be justified un presuming that the Visunins — the non-Aryan people mentioned among the enemies of Sudas in the Dāśarajña battle (RY VII 18 7) - must have received their peculiar name on account of their head gears adorned with horns It is, indeed, significant that, in that passage the Visanins are mentioned by the side of another tribe called the Siyas 220

Attention may now be drawn to another seal which closely connects the Indus Vally Siva cult with the Vedic Rudra The same familiar figure of the yogin is represented on a copper sealing, which also shows two devotees kneeling on the two sides of that figure with hands joined in prayer and two coiling ser pents both facing the figure &ldquo;I This seal provides unmistakable evidence for the assumption that the serpent cult must have constituted an integral part of the Indus Valley Siva cult The connection of the Vedic Rudra with serpents is already referred to above Nothing more need, therefore, be added here in that connection It may only be pointcd out that the serpent cult normally implied two things firstly, association with mountains and wild forests, and, secondly connection with vegetation ferti lity rites — in other words, things which are quite evident in the religious thought and practice relating to the Vedic Rudra
While discussing the religious cult of the red god of the proto Dravidians, which, at least to some extent, constituted the basis of the cult of the Vedic Rudra, we have already drawn attention to a very significant point of difference between the proto Dravidian religion and the Vedic Aryan religion, namely, the great importance attached to famale dividities in the former This must, indeed, be regarded as a feature which differentiates the Vedic Aryan religion from the pre Vedic proto Indian religion as a whole A large number of terracotta female figurines have been discovered at different sites in the Indus Valley This fact not only indicates the importance which must have becn attached to female divinities in the Indus Valley religion but, what is more significant for our present purpose, it also actually confirms the hypothesis regarding the prevalence, in the Indus Valley, of the cult of the Mother Goddess 32&rdquo; It is, therefore, possible to

presume that the Indus Valley religion represents a stage in the evolution of religious thought, wherein the cult of the Magna Mater coexisted with that of the equally important mile divinity, namely, proto Sıva 2) However, without going into any further details of this important problem, we may only emphasize what 15 most pertinent to our present purpose, namely, that the influ ence of the proto Indian mother cult can be traced also in the religious ideology connected with the Vedic Rudra It is well known that, in the Veda, Rudra is either called Tryambaka ( RV VII 59 12 ) or is associated with Ambikā (TS I 8 6, VS 3. 57, NISI 104, TBI 6 104, SPB IT 6 2 9 ) As for the Dame, Tryambaka, it should be remembered that it must have

223 So far as India is concerpcd the cvolut on of rel gious thought in thu respect seems to basc proceeded along some such lines as indicated below There is no doubt that, as elsewhere so also in India, the motho-cult and the Worship of the Mother Goddess rcpresented a very early form of primitive religion In course of time the concept of the Mother Goddess secms to have undergone a sort of sex differentiation as the result of which the supreme divinity came to be represented in two aspects the female and the malt-both aspects exisling s de by side This is the stage represented in the Indus Valley religion For a time thereafter under the influencc of the Vedic religious thought, the female aspect was almost relegated to oblivion (This must not of Course be understood to mean that Vedic religion and mythology bad remained epurely unaffected by the widely sprcad primitive Mother Goddess concept ) This stage represented in the Veda was then followed on the one hand, by a socond emphasis on and in somnc cases, a un fication of the male and the femalc aspects wluch are cvidenced in early Hinduism, by the forms of Sıva and Sakti and of Ardhanarisvara aod, on the other, by a revival of the exclusive Mother Goddess cult as evidenced in Saktism Ipcidentally it may be pointed out that B N PURI (PIHG V, 101 102 ) has connected the Indus Valley cult of the Mother Goddess with the Nana Amba cult of the hutana period and that S K DIKSHIT (The Alother Goddess ) seeres to connect the diverse symbols on ancient Indian coins and seals with the worship of a Mother Goddess The juxtapos tion of the mother cult and the Civa cult seems to prevail among the aborigines even today The Biyors for instance, ra se two stone-pillars to represent Dharatı (- Dhantri) and Mahadeva, who are propiated when harvest is gathered

been an ancient name of Rudra - a name, which, even in the early Vedic period, had dropped out of vogue Such an assump tion alone would explain why that came is not included in the Iists of Rudra&rsquo;s various names occurring in different Vedic texts 224 It is, at the same time, significant that the pame, Tryambaka, is preserved in connection with an ancient fertility-rite—a rite, which was, presumably, pre-Vedic origin but which was later on adapted into the Vedic ritual - pamely, Iraiyambaka homa. which is to be offered at the sahanedha, the third cäturmāsya. yāga Various attempts have been made to interpret the name, Tryambala,225 but the only interpretation, which is really satis factory, is that Tryambaka represents Rudra as connected with three mothers The creation mother, Ambă, and the creation god, Rudra, are thus brought together in connection with a popu. lar fertility cult The fact that Ambikī is sometimes referred to as a sister of Rudra328 or, in later literature, even as his wife, 227 should not create any difficulty For, as JOHANSSON has shown,228 the mythico-religious concepts of mother, sister, and wife are derived from a common primitive mother wife concept and are often mixed up together
Apart from the merging of the Mother Goddess cult and the proto-Sıva cult, which is rellected in the personality of the Vedic Tryambaka-Rudra, there is another – and, perhaps, more significant — religious phenomenon which is reflected in him In addition to the Great Mother, and, vodoubtedly, as an offshoot of that concept, the primitive people assumed the existence, by

the side of a male god, of certain female demon dividities, called
mothers, who were supposed directly to influence their day to day communal life 229 The number of such mothers&rsquo; varied from community to community The concept of Tryambaka. Rudra, as developed in the Veda, would seem to belong rather to this second type of religious thought For, like the guardian *mother' of a village, Ambikā is sometimes, represented as a frightful demoness helping Rudra in his malevolent activity (MS I 10 20, TBI 6 10), and, at other times, being propitiated by the worshippers, she is said to turn into a healing, luck-bringing, fertility-giving divinity
In the Indus Valley religion, however, special emphasis seems to have been put on the procreation fertility vegetation aspect of the mother cult Two seals discovered in the Indus Valley one at Harappa230 and the other at Mohenjodaro231 — are particularly significant in this connection On the Harappa sealing a nude female figure is depicted upside down with legs apart and with a plant issuing from her womb One can hardly doubt that the figure on this sealing is that of the Mother Goddess as the goddess of vegetation 23&rdquo; The Mohenjodaro seal depicts a nude figure with long hair, appearing between two branches of a tree la front of this goddess, there is another figure interpreted as that of a votary in an attitude of adoration Below are shown, in a row, seven female figures with long pig tails The connection of this seal also with the cult of fecundity and procreation is quite obvious 233 While on this subject, we may make a reference to

the attempt made by KOPPERS to connect the Central Indian fertility rites with the Indus culturc 234 KOPPERS points out that the focus of the fertility rites of the Bhils and the Gonds is a magic stand or table on which earth is laid and corn sowo at the beginping of the ceremonies This table, according to that scholar, may be connected with the mysterious cult object frequently depicted on the Indus seals in conjunction with a sacred bull Whatever that may be, for our purpose it would sufice to emphasize that the Vedic Rudra is closely copnected with the Indus Valley religion through the cults relating to pro creation, fertility, and vegetation
From a study of the Satarudrija, it becomes clear that the Vedic Rudra was regarded as the tutelary lord of trees and forests, of grass and cultivated farms 235 Rudra is harikeśa (VS 16 17 ) as the trees are harikeśa (TS IV. 521) He is saspiñara (VS 16 17), so is his host He is described as urvarya and khalya (TS IV 561) and as parna and parna sada (IS 16 46) Indeed, it would appear from that litany that Rudra is more directly and potrinsically related to the wild forest-people, to the wandering gypsies, and, perhaps in a slightly lesser degree, to the settied agriculturists than the other classes of the population As a matter of fact those people must have looked upon Rudra as one among themselves &ndash; as their leader
There can be little doubt that Rudra derived this peculiar aspect of his character from his prototype, the proto Indian Śiva It has been pointed out above that the cult of the proto Indian Sıva enjoyed almost an uobroken continuity among the direct descen dants of the proto Indian population as well as among those of the extra-braomanical or party brapmanised people Many seemingly uncoogeneal, but decidedly original, aspects of that cult are, accordingly, found to have bcen preserved in their folk songs, legends, religious practices, and festivals in medieval

Bengals literature,234 for instance, we see Sıva represented, on the one hand, as a typical cultivator-god and, on the other, as a typical vagrant god and a god of the vagrants 237 It is signi ficant that Siva is described in that literature not merely as a god of cultivators but as a god, who is himself a cultivator a god, who actually ploughs fields, sows seeds, takes out weeds, cuts grass, and carries it home 238 Rudra&rsquo;s epithets, harıkesa, saspiñara, saspya, etc, occurring in the Satarudriya, thus seem to have direct bearing on this aspect of the proto-Indian Siva&rsquo;s character
The other aspect of Siva&rsquo;s character emphasized in the early Bengali Saiva folk songs is perhaps more interesting He is there celebrated as a crazy mendicant addicted to various kinds of intoxicating drugs and associating himself with all types of lowly vagrant people 239 Such descriptions of Siva, which, it may be presumed, are true to the personality and character of the proto Indian Sıva, have their literary counterpart in the Satarudriya. Like the proto-Indian Siva, the Vedic Rudra also was regarded by rustics, vagabonds, low caste people, despised outcasts, and other similar unsocial elements of the population as their own special god and leader 240 Incidentally it may be added that, 10

238 Attention is drawn in this connection also to thc Gambhira and Gajapa fesuvals
239 Sıva is, in one place, characterised as badrydr po (= the son of a wandering sypsy) It is interesting to note that a kind of rationalisation was attempted in some songs by connecting the two aspect of Siva&rsquo;s character We are, for utance, told that Sva&rsquo;s fondness for drugs and low compasy reduced him to a state of poverty He was, therefore, persuaded (by a devotce, or by his wife Pirvarl) to take to agriculture

a sense, the Satarudrija descriptions reflect but the other side of Rudra&rsquo;s association with the iratas, the bralımacarms, and the munis 241
We can thus visualise a composite picture of the pre-Vedic proto-Indian god from the various facets of his personality - such as the red god of the proto Dravidians, the Paśupati-Yogisvara of the Indus Valley people, the supreme male god associated with the Mother Goddess cult and the cult of mothers', the god of procreation, fecundity, and vegetation, the cultivator god and the god of the cultivators, the vagrant god and the god of the vagrants, the creator and the destroyer, the demon divinity associated with wilderness and mountains, with dangerous places apd 10auspicious things, etc The Vedic Rudra has inherited most of these characteristics of the personality of the proto Indian god Indeed, Rudra is but an aryanised version of this proto Indian god It is sometimes suggested that the character of the Vedic Rudra is syncretic, that it has its origin in several mutually independent religious and mythological concepts But the mani. fold evidence, which has been produced above, should be sufficient to show that there existed a popular proto Indian god, whose cult had spread far and wide in pre-Vedic Iodia and had conti nued to be dominant, even after the Aryan migrations, on the fringes of the aryanised - Or, to put it more precisely, brahmanised
— regions ?!? It may, however, be presumed that, in different regions, the same god was either called by different names, or different features of bis character and cult were specifically
241 A reference may be made, at the stage, to one characteristic feature of the Rudra-Siva cult nam-ly, thar, in that cult, the worshippers think of the god in terms of his immediate presence - they always look upon him as being very close to them, as duectly influencing their lives The fact that Siva 1: not generally represcried as taking aralaras is very significant in this context

cmphasized Does the salapatha-Brahmana (I 7 3 8), for instance, not tell us that he was called Sarva by the Eastern people,248 and Bhava by the Vähikas,&ldquo;44, or that his character as pasūnanı palı was celebrated in one region and his character as Rudra 10 another? It seems that, on account of their encounter with the outlandish people like the Vähikas, the Prācyas, the Vrātyas,245 the proto Dravidians, etc, the Vedic Aryans came into contact with the widely-spread religious cult of the proto Siva 246 The impact of that cult on the Vedic religion must have been particularly powerful and the popular pressure for the adaptation of that cult into the Vedic Aryan religious complex must have, indeed, been irresistible The hieratic Vedic poet priests, however, seem to have reacted to this pressure 10 a peculiar way As indicated above, while introducing the proto Indian god in the Vedic pantheon in the form of Rudra, they have attempted tendentiously to suppress many traits of that god&rsquo;s personality and character and alter several items connected with the popular primitive rites associated with him Two things must, however, be remembered so far as these attempts of the

243 The Sarva form of the proto-Indian god, which, according to the ŚPB was popular in Eastern Indu, seems to hasc represented that god parti cularly at a wielder of bow and arrows It is therefore, likely that Sarva was a special god of hunters and, praumably, of other rustic and vagrant ypsics That Siva should have been prominently represented as a vagrant god and god of vagrants in the medieval folk songs of Bengal (that is, Lastern India) very ugnificant in this connection It is suggested by CHARPENTIER ( 11ZKAI XXIIT, 167 ) that the Eastemers had also developed another müder side of Sıva

Vedic poet priests are concerned Firstly, these attempts seem to have been made mainly in respect of the RV And, secondly, as has happened in similar circumstances, jo spite of these attempts, several incidental references have found their way, even in the RV, which betray the true character of Rudra If one leaves out of consideration the peculiar priestly side growth, in the RV, of the original Rudra Siva cult and mythology, one will realise that there is an unbroken continuity of religious tradition from the proto Śiva to the epic Sıva who is worshipped even to this day, and that Siva must, accordingly, be regarded as having the longest continuous record of godhead — not only in India but perhaps also in the entire civilised world &ldquo;47

<p>SOME ASPECTS OF THE AGNI-MYTHOLOGY IN THE VEDA</p>
<p>The subject of my lectures! is “Some Aspects of the Agol. Mythology in the Veda &quot; Accordingly, my aim, in these lectures, will not be to present any detailed and connected statement about the Agar mythology as a whole, I shall only endeavour to emphasize certain points relating to Agni as he figures in the Vedic mythology and ritual - points, which, I think, do not usually receive sufficient attention of course, while doing so, I shall have to presume, on the part of my listeners, a general acquain tance with the broad outlines of the Agni-mythology
It is well known that Agni is, Dext to Indra, the most promi. nent of the Vedic gods He is celebrated in at least 200 hymns of the RV, and, in many others, he is invoked conjointly with other divinities On this background, some of the features of the Agni mythology seem rather peculiar Agni is seen to be often isolated from the compact mass of the Vedic gods For instance, he is! regarded as being more earthly than &lsquo;heavenly. He is looked&rsquo; upon mainly as an envoy of gods rather than as a god He is also the hotr or the purohita of the gods, their eye, their mouth, even their animal' The gods are said to have employed him for ritual service, and, as a reward for such service, to have bestowed upon him eternal youth. It is also noteworthy that Agai is rarely represented as having a share in Soma with the other gods? The peculiar position of Ago in the Vedic mytho. logy seems to have been alluded to by a Vedic poet when he, very significantly, says of him in RV I 69 2 bluvo devānam pitā putrah san “ You became the father of gods, though their son&rdquo;

Another peculiar feature of the Agon-mythology in the Veda is the original dichotomy between the mythological Agni and the sacrificial fire [t have deliberately used the word agni in the mythological context and the word fire in the ritual context 1 Today I propose to begin with a brief consideration of this point
It is evident that Agni as a Vedic god is to be clearly distin guished from the sacrificial fires, such as, the alaantja, the gārhapalya, and the daksina. These fires are never referred to as deialas Sacrificial oblations are offered on these fires, but never to these fires The aha anıya and the other fires are not to be regarded even as different forms of god Agai In the ritual sütras, we find that oblations are prescribed to be offered to different Agnis, such as, vratapati Agni, amlomuc Ago), anka ant Agni, tantumant Agni, and pathukri Agni ( as many as fifty-six such Agais are mentioned in connection with the seven Hayıryajña samsthās only)but never to the ahavaniya fire, the gårliapatya firc, etc It may be that, as suggested by some scholars, the concept of the three sacrificial fires has been derived from the triple character of the Vedic Agni, namely, as Surya, Váyu or Indra, and Ago! But to identify the three sacrificial fires with certain mythological concepts mentioned in the RV seems to be unwarranted I propose to discuss, at some length, one such identification.
HILLEBRANDT believes that Narāśamsa is the Rgvedic name for the dahsına fire of the later vtual He thinks that, though the RV is principally intended for the service of gods, there are, in it, certain clear indications of the cult of the Pitars One such is the mention of narasamsa, which has to be understood as the old name for the fire of the Pitars HILLEBRANDT further says that Narāśamsa is also the designation of a god who stands in the same relation to the fire of the Pitars as Surya does to the

ahayanıya fire He, however, hastens to add that the starting point of bis hypothesis is, indeed, not the RV, but the later and surer ritual tradition In the Soma-sacrifice, there are to be offered five nārāśamsas - two in the morning, two at midday, and ope in the evening Nārāśamsa, in this context, is the pame given to certain goblets of Soma The officiating priests first drink out of these camasas, perform an apyayana in respect of them (by means of Soma, or, according to Baudhāyana, by means of the yasainiart waters, or, according to some other teachers, by mere touching ), and then place them under the southern havırdhana cart It is said in the commentary on ApSS 12 25 25 that
because these goblets have Narāsamsa as their divinity, they are called parasamsas? The putting dowp of the camasas on the ground and towards the south puts their connection with the cult of the Pitars beyond doubt the close connection between the pārāsamsas and the Pitars becomes further clear from the follow ing significant reference occurring in SPB, IJI 6 2 25 yad havırdhanayor nārašamsah sidantı tat prirsu juhon tasmāt pilarah sant. The mantra, which is prescribed to accompany the con suming of the Soma in these camasas by the officiating priests is given in the AitBr 7 34 as narasamsapitasya deva soma te matıyıda amaih [(at the morning pressing), urvail (at the midday pressing), kavyaih (at the third pressing) i purblir bhaksıtasya bhaksajamı About this, the commentary on the TS says narāśamsapıtasya potrpitasya iti padadvayam narasamsa camasabhaksane eva prayoktavyam, na anyatra, iti ekah paksah / sarvatra pathiravyam iti aparah paksah / naraih šasyante iti narā samsah pitrvisesah The mantra prescribed in this connection by the SankhŠS 7 5 22 is also quite revealing devo &lsquo;si narāśamso yat te miedhah svar jyotis tasya ta ūmaih 1(at the morning pressing), urvaih (at the midday pressing), kavyaih ( at the third pressing )] pirblur bhaksıtasjo pahulasyo &lsquo;pahuto bhak sayāmı When the varasamsas are got ready at the midday savana, daksinä is given away to the priests And the priests seem to have been often regarded as representatives of the Pitars For, since the
6
TS Como III, p 110
anvāharya caru is cooked on the daksina fire, it must have been intended for the Pıtars, but it is actually given over to the priests as the representatives of the Pitars At the third sarana, an offering is directly made to the Pitars 10 close connection with the nārasamsa camasas It is further noteworthy that, when the nārāsamsas are laid down at their respective places, each priest puts under bis camasa three picces of the remaining purodāsa, for his ancestors In the namaskāra mantras connected with this rite also, a Dention is made of the Pitars Thus, accordipg to HILLEBRANDT, the close relationship between Narāsamsa and the Pitars is beyond reasonable doubt
HILLEBRANDT finds support for his hypothesis also from RV X 57 3, which, according to the SŚS (III 17 3), is emplo yed in a Patryajaa The Th reads
mano ny a huamahe narasamsena somena/
pilinām ca manmabluli// It is significant that, according to the sankiss, the officiating priest steps behind the dak sina fire (that is, the fire of the Pitars) with this and the following two verses HILLEBRANDT inciden tally refers also to the formula from the VS (19 61 ), which is employed at the Pitryajña in the Sauirāmani, namely, agnisy attān tumaro hajamahe narašamse soniapıtham ya asuh
There is another line of argument in support of the above hypothesis As is well known, the name nārasamsi is given to certain Vedic texts, which are mainly intended to praise the daksinas given away, in former times, by liberal patrons These are recited alternately with the pāriplavas, which glorify the models in history and legends of the sacrificing princes Thus the närāšansıs, like the pariplavas, are, by and large, devoted to the glorification of some deceased princes or other distinguished
dead persons In other words, according to HILLEBRANDT, they relate to the cult of the Pitars The närāśamsverscs, as verses relatiog to the Pitars, are regarded as being of a lower order in comparison to the verses relating to the gods For, the MS (1. 11,5 ) says Jo gathanārāsamsıbhyam sanon na tasja prais.
36
282
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
The word anrta in this context
grhy am anrtena in sa tat sanoti implies the lower order
The material about Narasamsa in the RV is decidedly scanty, and the few passages where the word narašanısa occurs are either colourless or obscure It may, however, be noted that in each of the two Bihaspati hymns, namely, I 18 and X 182, one stanza is addressed to Narasamsa? This may suggest that here Nara Samsa and Brhaspati are more or less identified According to RY LX 83 3 Brhaspati is closely related to the Pitras HILLEBRANDT further adds that Brhaspati is essentrally the moon god and the moon is basically the divinity of the Pitars All these facts would then seem to confirm the close relationship between Narasamsa and the Pitars In MS IV 13 8 and TBr III 6 13 Narasamsa 15 called trišırsan and sadaksa These latter are also the epithets of Visvarupa, who, too, is identified with the moon or the god of the Pitars It is, accordingly, averred that Broaspati, Visvarupa, and Narāśamsa have a common origin and that all the three are closely related to the cult of the Pilars
Though HILLEBRANDT generally believes that the etymo logy of a Vedic god s pame does not necessarily help a correct understanding of that god&rsquo;s nature, in the word narasamsa, he tries to find support for his present hypothesis According to bim, the literal meaning of the word, namely, praise of men, makes no sense whatever There is no doubt that nara in narašamsa stands for the genitive plural naram It is to be regarded as an object genitive form T he root sams may be connected with the Avestan sanh, Latin censeo, and samsa which is an agent noun, derived from that root, may mean censor&rsquo; Nardansa 15, accordingly, hominum judex, that is, the &lsquo;censor of mea, or, secondamny, the adjudicntor of the dead&rsquo;s Like Yama, he is the lord and the leader of the Pitars
In the Vedic ritual, there are three principal fires, out of which one, namely, the daksina fire, is assigned to the Pitars

ASPECTS OF AGNI MYTHOLOGY
283
And, as has been pointed out above, in the RV, Agni Narāśamsa is closely related to the cult of the Pitars From this, it is conclu ded that Agni Narāsamsa is the duk sina fire of the later ritual
There have also been other attempts to identify the sacrificial fires with the various forms of the Rgvedic Agni It is, for in stance, suggested that the ahgiani a fire is related to the heavenly form of Agni represented by Surya the dah sina fire to the aerial form of Agnt represented by Vayu Indra, or Vidyut, and the garhopatya fire to the terrestrial Agni But, in this lecture, I am not directly concerned with any of these attempts I may, how ever, refer to one fact which is perhaps pertinent to our present purpose It is this While HILLEBRANDT identifies Agni Narā. samsa with the dok sina fire LUDWIG thinks that Agn Nara Samsa is to be identified with the ahaianiya fire&rsquo; or course, both these views seem to me to be quite unacceptable But here I propose to deal at some length only with the former HILLE BRANDT seems to think that the Rgvedic material is hopelessly unhelpful in the matter of determining the character of Narsamsa He, therefore, makes the later ritual tradition the starting point of his hypothesis The more correct method perhaps consists in first probing into the Rgvedic material thoroughly and then correlating that material with the material derived from the ritual tradition
Let us then examine the Rgvedic material It should be noted at the very outset, that, in the RV, one hardly finds emphasised any special relationship between Naraśamsa and Agn: Indeed, the concept of Agni Narāsamsa as such, does not exist in that Veda RV III 29 11 actually implies that Agar and Narasamsa are two separate entities Fren in the Nighantu 10 Narasamsa is given as an independent appellation Narīvamsa 15 twice connected with Pusan (I 106 4 and X 64 3) Hc 15 mentioned in the second verses of four Apri hymns (namely, II 3, V 5, VII 2, and X 70 ) and in the third verses of two Apri

hymns (namely, I 13 and I 142) Incidentally, I may mention that, here, I have not taken into account the distinction made, 10 the Saryanul ramani of Katyavana, between the Apra and the Apri la RV X 92 11, Narasamsa is characterised as caturanga &lsquo;four bodied&rsquo;, but it is not clear whether, in that passage, caturanga is the epithet of Narāśamsa or of the following divinity Yama Narašamsa is gnaspati lord of a celestial wife&rsquo; (II 38 10) He is honey tongued madhujilna) and an offerer of oblations (havishrt) (I 13 3) and has honey in his hand (V 52) Three times a day, he spriokles the sacrifice with honey (I 142 3) He leads the gods to sacrifice (X 70 2) Among the gods, the greatness of Narusamsa is to be celebrated, for, it is through him that gods come and accept the sacrifice (VII 2 2) Narāśamsa ordains the forms of sacrifice and brings the gods together at the summit of the sacrifice (11 32) The close relationship between Narāśamsa and Brbaspati, as indicated 10
RVI 18 9 and X 182 2, has been already referred to above
It will be clear from this brief statement, based on the Rgvedic material, that Narāsamsa is nowhere accompanied by the name Agai, that he is pot connected exclusively with Agni, that no special relationship between Narāśamasa and the Pitars is anywhere indicated, and that, on the other hand he is closely associated with the gods and is mainly responsible for bringiog them to the sacrifice and for making the sacrifice acceptable to them It must also be emphasised that the bynas in which Narasamsa figures prominently, namely, the Apri hymas, relate to animal sacrifice and not to the cult of the Pitars
HILLEBRANDT&rsquo;s interpretation of the name narasamsa as hominum judex or censor is, indeed, too bold The two accen ted word narasamsa is split up into its two elements as dia jana yatayann antar syate nara ca samsam daivyam ca dharları ja RV IX 86 42 and as nara va samsam pusanam agohyam agnim deveddhan abhy arcase gira in X 64 3 &lsquo;That, in these passages, the word nara stands for naram is clearly indicated by another passage helonging to the same category, namely, RV II 34 6 a no brahmani marutah samanyavo naram na samsah savanani
ASPECTS OF AGNI MYTHOLOGY
285
gantana As a matter of fact, the word camisa conected with narām (or nrnām) occurs in many other passages, such as, I
173 9 and 10, VI 24 2, and III 16 4 Attention may be drawn, in this context, also to the phrase narya Samsa (1 1859) A
divinity called Nisainsa, which can be presumed to be identical with Narasamsa, is mentioned in IX 81 5, and, significantly enough, like narasamsa, the word nršamsa also has two accents In all these passages, narā or narām is subject genitive (and not object-genitive as HILLEBRANDT takes it to be ) This assump tion is confirmed by some other passages where the word samsa is accompanied by undoubted subject genitive forms such as, asmahan (1 94 8), yajamānasja (1 178 4, II 20 7), and mama (1 182 4) As for the element samsa in narasamsa, the 10ital accent would clearly show that the word cannot be an agent poun as HILLEBRANDT assumes What is, however, still more significant for our purpose is that samsa (particularly when it is joined to nara or narām or nrnam), nowhere in the RY, means &lsquo;censor lord&rsquo;, or &lsquo;adjudicator&rsquo; Sansa is derived from the root canis, which originally means nuch more than to praise. It means &lsquo;to utter ceremoniously an esoterically work ing magically potent formula! This meaning receives support from many Rgvedic passages such as, 1 21 2,33 7, JIL 3 8, VI 29 4, VII 19 9 The element śmsa in narasamsa is a nomen actiones from this root sams The primary sense of narasamsa is, accordingly, the samsa or the magically potent formula produced by men or priests incidentally it may be pointed out that the interpretation of the word nrfnar in the sepse of priests need not be regarded as strange On the contrary, the use of the word in that sense is historically very significant it is well known that, at one stage in the evolution of the Vedic mythology, with a VicW to counterbalancing the national war god Indra whose growing importance tended to result in martial valour completely super seding priestcraft, the Vedic poct priests created the concept of a god of magically potent mantros, namely, Bşbaspatt or Brahmana. spati, and sought to clevate that god to the position of the war god Indra by endowing him with many epithets and accesso TICS usually attributed to the latter Brtaspati or Brahmanaspati

actually came to be celebrated as being responsible for many of Indra&rsquo;s exploits Naturally enough, in this new mythological perspective, the persons who were most active in the special domain of Brhaspati Brahmanaspati, namely, the Vedic poet priests, were endowed with an epithet derived from the domain of the war-god lodra, namely, nr/nar
The primary sense of narasamsa is the magically potent formula produced by men, that is, priests Narāśamsa then also represented the divine personification of such formula It would now become abundantly clear why Narasamsa is characterised as devānām agrajalā (X 702) and why he is said to make sacrifice acceptable to the gods The sphere of Narāśamsa&rsquo;s activity is sacrifice to the gods, he is kavi, vipra, and mativid, he is honey tongued, in the Apri hynas, he is mentioned with such essential adjuncts of sacrifice as barhis, yūpa, etc All this would now be in order It may be further pointed out that Narāśamsa is closely associated with Brhaspati pot because both of them are connected with the cult of the Pitars, but because Bçhaspati Brahmanaspati is the lord of the magically potent formula and so is Narāśamsa In the RV, Narasamsa is a living religio mythological concept, which must have originally been independent of the concept of Agni This concept involved two main ideas, namely, (1) of priestly efficacy and (2) of the magically potent formula itself functioning as the duta of the gods These two were also the main ideas, which were originally 10volved in the concept of Agni And it is from this specific point of view that the two originally independent concepts namely, those of Narasamsa and Agni, are brought together
The Vedic Narāsa msa has his obvious counterpart in the Avestan Nairyosanha It is true that this pale and insignificant Avestan dividity does not throw any special light on the character of Narasamsa One reference from the Vendidad is, however, of some consequence for our present purpore Vendidad 19 34 reads &ldquo;The aša believers unite together, Nairyosanha unites himself with them, the messenger of Ahura Mazdah, that is Nairyosanha &quot; Similarly, Nairyosanhi&rsquo;s main function sceps to

have been indicated in Vd 22 7 fr, which says “To Nairyo. sanha spake he, the creator Ahura Mazdah, &ldquo;O eloquent Nairyosanha, go to the house of Airyaman and convey to him the following message&rsquo; In pursuance of this behest, the eloquent Nairyosanha went and conveyed the message to Airyaman &quot; Nairyosanha&rsquo;s epithet eloquent&rsquo; and his service as duta establish that Avestan dividity&rsquo;s close affinity to Naraśamsa (and also to Agoi)
HILLEBRANDT makes great capital of the RV passage X 57 3, mano n a huamahe narasamsena somena / piirnām ca manmabhuih, to support his hypothesis On account of the occurrence of nārāşamsa, soma, and putrs in close proximity in this rk, he immediately connects it with the rite relating to the nārāsassa camiasa in the Soma sacrifice For whatever ritualistic purpose this hymn may have been prescribed by the later SS, what is here suggested by HILLEBRANDT is quite unwarranted, so far as the Rgvedic evidence is concerned Tradition gives a distinct historical legendary background for the group of the four Gaupayara hymns, namely, X 57-60, and in this background, there is not even a remote hint of a Soma sacrifice King Asa mati of the Iksvākus dismissed thc Gaupāyana brothers, who had held the office of his Purohita, and appointed two incantation experts in their place in great resentment, thic Gaupāyanas practised imprecation against the king Thereupon the two pew Purohias killed Subandhu, one of the Gaupuyana brothers It scems from the present passage, X 37 3, that the remaining three brothers sought to invoke back the spirit of the deceased Subandhu in three ways, namely, by means of narāśamsa or magically potent formula, by means of Soma, and through the prayers of the Pitars
As for the evidence derived from the Soma camasas, called Darāśamsas, I should, first of all, like to point out that it is methodologically not correct to utilize later ritual tradition as a primary source for the understandig of the Rgvedic mythology, particularly when the RV itself can provide a fairly helpful amount of material for that purpose Besides, a critical study of the
288
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
mantras and ritual action connected with the rite of the pārāśamsa camasas would seem to show that that rite did not relate to the cult of the Pitars in general It, no doubt, implies a kind of glorification of the Pitars — but not of all the Pitars Only such priestly ancestors are here intended as had, through the grace of god Narāsamsa, mastered the art of narāśamsa or magically potent formulas It should be noted that, in the mantras employed in this connection, such as, upahută rsayo daivyasas tanūpārānas tanvas tapoja upa nam rayo dawjaso hvayantâm tanūpavānas tanvas tapojah (AsvśS 561) and śrvo me saptarsin upa 11 sthasva (KatSS 9 12 4 ), the rsis or sapta rsayah are specifically mentioned, that the Pitars drinking from the nārāsamsa camasas are called vipra, and that one class from among them is designa ted as kāvya It is perhaps still more noteworthy that, in this context, Soma is characterised as matnud The priests and their rsi-ancestors are supposed to be drinking together from the same camasas, so that the blessing of Narásamsa, which the ancestors had enjoyed, would be available also to the present generation In the complex ritualistic situation implied by the rite of the narasamsa camasas the relationship between Narasamsa and the Pitars corresponds to that between Brhaspati Brahminaspati and the Angirases Those Pitars do not represent manes in general; they rather represent the priestly rsi ancestors like the Angirases
Coming now to the nārāsanisis, it must be pointed out that there is no ground whatsoever for the assumption that they em body the praise or glorification exclusively of deceased princes and other distinguished personalities The being dead of these personalities nowhere figures as an essential feature of the nara samsis As a matter of fact, a larger number of these texts relate to living patrons By no stretch of imagination, therefore, can the narasamsis be connected even remotely with the cult of the Pitars We have seen that norāšamsa denotes, on the one hand, magically efficacious formula, and, on the other, the presiding divinity of such a formula It is permissible to assume a further semasiological extension of this word on what may be called a material plane, whereby narasamsa came to mean also the matç

Tial reward which was made possible by the narašamsa formula The verses which celebrated these rewards and their donors then came to be designated as nārajamsis
The word narasamsa has two accents (cf Panj VI 2 140 ), and this does create some difficulty The fact that norāšansa has two accents and that the first element looks like a dual form have led some scholars to think that narasanusa is a diandia compound, more particularly a devatā diandra Which two divities are designated by this name? In the history of the Vedic studies in the West - particularly of the studies relatiog to the Vedic my thology &ndash; at least three distinct currents of thought can be clearly marked out so far as the naturalistic noterpretation of that my thology is concerned According to one current of thought, whose great sponsor may be said to have been MAX MULLER, most of the important mythological concepts in the Veda can be satisfactorily interpreted as representing different variations of the activity of the sun In other words, according to this current of thought, the Vedic mythology is essentially a solar mythology The second school of thought is represented by HILLEBRANDT and, to some extent, OLDENBERG, who are inclined to see in the Vedic mythology a preponderance of the moon god Anthropo. logy has established that in the mythologies of most of the primi. tive peoples the moon plays a more important role than the sun And this, it is asserted, is but what is to be expected According to HILLFBRANDT, the Vedic mythology is no exception to thus rule Then there is the third view, accordiog to which the Veda consists mainly of the myths of thunder and lightning An attempt 15 made to interpret the derara diandva, narážanısa, in the ught of this last view, as representing lightning and thunder 11 The root Sams, it is pointed out, means to announce', &lsquo;to express ceremo Diously, and, then, &lsquo;to portend&rsquo;, &lsquo;to prophesy&rsquo; The goun samsa would then mean that which prophesies* or &lsquo;a portent&rsquo; la the agrarian culture of the Vedic people, the portent which was most anxiously sought was that of cloud and thunder So the word

samsa came to denotc cloud and thunder in a rather prominent way It is possible to derive from samsa the sense of cloud or thunder in another way also Thc root sams mcans &lsquo;to speak out&rsquo;, &lsquo;to pronouncc loudly, to roar&rsquo;, the nomen agentis, Samsa, would then mean the roaring one. As for the clement nară, it is to be derived from the root nr / mrt &lsquo;to dance&rsquo; And in the context of thunder &lsquo;dancing&rsquo; is the characteristic feature of lightning The meaning of nr / nar as warrior represents the semantic extension of the root nr / art &lsquo;to dance&rsquo;, in another direction, through the intermediate stage of the concept of war dance Thus the compound narålamisa denotes dancing or leap ing' and &lsquo;portending or roaring&rsquo;, or, in other words, lightning and thunder' Incidentally it is also suggested that the entire compound nara anusa is to be found with its members 10 reverse order, in the Greek namc, Kassandrē.

Šansa as lightning and thunder' to any serious examination Suffice it to say that it is quite unsustainable both linguistically and conceptually The hypothesis seems to have had its starting point in the consideration of the accent of the word narašamsa If narašamsa is a detalā diandia (Panipi VI 2 141 does not regard it as such ), why, it may be asked, is the second member of the compound also not represented in sts dualized form? Even so far as the first member of the compound is concerned, as has been indicated above, the relevant Rgvedic references make it neces sary to understand nará as standing for the genitive plural naram rather than as a nominative dual form The difficulty in inter preting samisa with its initial accent as a nomen agentis has been already mentioned above Conceptually, there is no trace of lightning and thunder in any of the Narašamsa passages alluded to above One thing cannot, however, be gainsaid, namely, that, in any hypothesis, the accent of narasamsa will remain an irregularity
The Apri hymns, which may be characterised as purposeful but obscure conglomerations of mutually not very consistent ritualistic concepts, indeed, constitute a veritable problem in
ASPECTS OF AGNI-MYTHOLOGY
291
Vedic studies To my mind, most of the points, involved in that problem, continue to defy satisfactory elucidation even to this day
There are two distinct types of Apri hymns — this distinction being mainly based on the consideration as to which of the two divinitas, Narāśamsa and Tanupapat, is celebrated in their second verses Out of the ten Ăpri hymos in the RV, four (namely, I 188, III 4, IX 5, and x 110) belong to the exclusive Tanunapāt type, and four (namely, II 3, V 5, VII 2, and X 70 ) to the ex clusive Naraśamsa type, while two (namely, I 13 and I 142) have Tanūnapät celebrated in their second verses and Narasamsa in their third verses It may be presumed that these two types of Apri hymns reflect an ancient schism in the Vedic ritual tradition. We have already studied the concept of Narasamsa Let us now try to find out what Tanunapāt represents, and see whether the fixation of the character of these two, namely, Narāśamsa and Tanūnapät, throws any light on the sclism reflected in the Apri hymos
The word, tanīnapal, generally unaccompanied by agmi, occurs eight times in the RV-six of these occurrences being in the Apri hymns The facts that the Nighantu (5 2) regards Tanu napāt as an independent pane, that the concept of Agni Tapu napát, as such, does not exist in the RV, and that, in RV III 4 2 and II 29 II, Tapuna păt is actually sought to be distinguished from Agni would seem to suggest that, like Narāśamsa, Tanupapāt also originally represented an independent religio mythological concept and that, on account of some essential common point, that concept was brought in close relationship with the concept of Agni
Tapunapät is described as beautiful-tongued (X 110 2) He is besought to take the sacrifice to gods (I 13 2) of bim it is said, in RV III 42, that gods, Varuga. Mitra, and Agni, implore him threc times a day, every day In RV III 29 11, where he is sharply distinguished from Matariyan and Narasamsa, he is referred to as asura garbla Depending on RV IX 52, HILLEBRANDT, the advocate of the moon mythology in the Veda, pace regarded Tanunapät as lunar fire, but later gave up that
292
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
hypothesis 12 On the whole, the scanty — and more or less conventional — descriptions of Tanunapāt in the RV are of little help in determiniog his character Later Vedic ritual has a rite called Tanudaptra, at which the officiating priests and the sacri ficer are expected to take oaths of mutual loyalty and help The mantras which are prescribed to accompany the taking up of clarified butter for this site, namely, apataje tva grlınamı pari pataye tva grhnamı tanunapire tia grhnámi, etc, are given in TS I 2 10, and the commentary on this passage explains āpati as prāna, paripati as manas, and tanīnaptr as jātharagni The SPBr, on the other hand, describing the tanunaptra rite, seems to interpret tanūnapat quite differently When the gods took the oath of alliance in the presence of Prajapati, Tanupapāt, the strong one, was the witness And, as the Brāhmana adds (III 4 25) He who blows is Tanunapāt, the strong one He is the superintendent of all beings, within whom he moves as in and out breath So Tanunapat is there regarded as a wind god But, elsewhere, the ŚPBr itself identifies Tapunapat with grisma or the summer-sun It says (I 5 3 10) grismo vai tanunapad grismo hy asam prajānam tandis tapası The TBr (II 6 7) brings Tanuvapat in close relationship with Indra, while the MS (IV 13 2) characterises him as aditeh garbha and bhuvanasya gopa All this material concerning Tarunapāt, which has been derived from the texts relating to the Vedic ritual is as unhelpful from our point of view as the Rgvedic material The name tanūnapat also provides no useful clue Assuming the identity of Tanunapat with Agai, the word tanūnapat is explained as *son of himself', which implies fire spontaneously generated in wood and cloud According to BERGAIGNE, Tanunapät is the bodily, that is, aurasa, son of the divine father 18 Adverting to the double accent of the word tanūnapar (cf Pānını VI 2 140), FAY, who would regard the Vedic mythology as essentially the mythology of lightning understands tanunapāt as a diandra compound denoting thunder (tanu from the root ran/stan) and lightning 14 This is obviously too far fetched (It may also be

pointed out that Pânici VI 2 141 does not regard tanūnapät as a deiată dvandva) So the original character of Tapunapät re mains vague and uncertain
A hypothesis may, however, be hazarded in this connection Whatever the origin of Tapunapāt, it may be assumed that, at somc stage in the evolution of that concept, Tapunapát came to be identified with Agni This may have been due to the recogni tion of the fact that Agoi himself is the seed of Agol, that Agai is his self-son' This characteristic feature of Agni perhaps became most evident in a sacrifice, where one sacrificial fire is * spread out' from another As is well known, the Vedic sacrifice 1s constituted mainly of two basic elements, the ritual action and the magical formula relating to that action, or karma and mantra, The ritual action or karma is usually centred round the sacrificial fire and may be symbolized by Tapudapāt And we have already seen that Narāśamsa symbolizes the magically potent mantra Can the two types of Apr hymns be regarded as representing two schools of thought in the Vedic ntual tradition &ndash; the Tanunapat school emphasizing the superiority of harma over mantra and the Narāsansa school emphasizing the superiority of manfra over karma ?
Unlike the words, narasamsa and taninapát, the word, vaisia. nara, Dever occurs in the RV unaccompanied by the name Agni Yanvānara is found mentioned in fourteen hymns of the RY, of almost all of which Vaisvanara Agai is the devata according to the Anukrananı In the Nighanju (51) also, Vaisyanara is gives as one of the games of Ago! It has been long sisce established that, at some stage in the cvolution of the Vedic mythology, Agni came to be identified with Surya In most of such cases where Surya is conceived of as a form of Agni, it is Vaišvānara Agai that is specifically intended The small group of hymns, pamely, RV VI 7-9, or verses 10-13 of RV X 88, would place this point beyond any rcasonable doubt, for, in these passages, Agni Varšvānara occurs more or less as a synonym of Surya This conception of Valvānara Agni as Surya is continued also in the Vedic ritual The most usual oblation to Agai Vaizvā294
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
para consists of a sacrificial cake on twelve potsherds (dia daśakapala purorlasa), which is obviously suggestive of the twelve months of the year As the TS (II 25 says yad vaišianaro dvadašakapalo bhavati samvatsaro ya agnir vaistanarah 15 And the close relationship between samvatsara and Surya is self evident Further, the pravargya is undoubtedly a tite connected with Surya, and there too Agai Vaisvanara is clearly mentioned The TA (V 10 5) actually says esa va agnir saisvanaro pat pra vargyah A mention may be made in this context, of another ritualistic feature of Vaisvanara Agni, which is particularly signi ficant from our present point of view Vaisvanara Agni and the Maruts are set side by side as representing a prince and his sub jects The TS (IJ 2 5 6) for instance, prescribes vaisianaram diadasakapalam mirvapen marulam saptahapalam graniakamah This connection between Vaišvānara Agni and the ksatra is fur ther confirmed by the rite relating to the dhrina goblet In the Agnistoma the dhruva goblet is placed on a golden plate and is believed to belong to Vatsvanara This goblet has to be guarded by a royal prince, and a series of ritualistic ceremonies, implyiog the setting aside of the usurper and the restoration of the right. ful ruler is performed in respect of it That, in the TBr (II 2 54) Vaisvanara is referred to as a chariot is also quite suggestive
But Agni Vaisvabara is also mentioned in connection with the descent of Agni to the earth (RV III 24, VI 84) In deed, in passages like RV I 59 2, we actually have Vaisvanara represented in two forms as the head of the heaven (mürdha dnal) and as the navel of the earth (nablih priluvah) RV X 88 14 speaks of Vatsvānara as prevailing avastat and parastal This would explaia why in Nir 7 23, Vaisvanara is explained as Surya by the ancient Yajnikas, and as &lsquo;this Agni&rsquo; by Śakapuni ( with whom incidentally, Yaska himself seems to agree) Vaisvā. nara is in a few passages mentioned in juxtaposition with Surya (cf RVI 98 1) and, in one passage (IV 14 11 ), the MS speaks of voisvanaram bibhrarı bhumih

Agar Vanvīnara, accordiogly, does not seem to have been conceived by the Vedic poet as belonging to any particular region, As has been pointed out in RI' VII 5 4, the thrcefold world, the heaven and the earth, follost the ordinance of Varsvānara Agni fara frıdhatu prihni uta djanr jaisvanara Tratam agno sacanta Vanvānara Agai thus represents a mythological concept which transcends the frequently mentioned triple character of Agi Vaby para Agni is, verily, the Agai who pertains to all men It may be remembered that there are many Agnis men tioned in the RV- Agni of Drvodās and Agni of Vadhryašva, and Agni of the Bharatas and Agni of the Kausikas Similarly, in the diesta we have athar burzin (fire of the agriculturists ), athar gušasp (fire of the warriors) and athar fra fire of the priests) But this is Agnu Vaisvānara, the Agnt of all men !
It has been suggested above that the two originally inde pendent divinities, namely, Narāsamsa and Agni, are brought together in close relationship on account of certain common characteristics which they share The basic concept underlying Narāśamsa is that of the magically potent formula, which attracts the gods towards itself, which, in other words, leads the gods to the sacrifice and makes the sacrifice acceptable to them in a sense, therefore, Naraśamsa functions as an efficient intermediary beta ween men and gods He is the duta or envoy serving, in a variety of ways, as a necessary connecting link between the gods and the sacrifice It is exactly this character as an intermediary between men and gods, as a dura, as a priest who makes the sacrifice efficacious, which is the most basic character of the Rgvedic Agar It needs to be emphasised, over and over again, that the Vedic mythology is, in essence, by no means naturalistic Tliat is to say, the personification of natural powers and nhenomena must not be regarded as the starting point of the genesis of the Vedic gods It is not as if the Vedic people derfied the natural clcmcnt of fire and thereby produced the mythological concept of Vedic Agni History of religion clearly shows that a specific religio mythological concept originates independently in a specific cu ral environment, and it is only at some later stage, and as
296
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
after-thought, that that concept is associated with some natural phenomenon of course such wedding of a religio mythologie cal concept to a phenomenon of nature does not necessarily occur in every case In a sense, naturalism is the result of a kind of poetic operation Natural phenomena are thought of merely as suitable symbols', through which religio mythologi. cal concepts can be effectively expressed These concepts evolve independently before they are thus brought into entirely extraneous relationship with patural powers and phenomena The fact that one and the same dividity is often connected with several natural phenomena is very significant in this context For, it only shows that a single religio mythological concept can be ex pressed through different symbols' Naturalism is thus entirely secondary (except in respect of a few &lsquo;elemental&rsquo; dividities ), and ought never to be made the starting point of a mythological study
It is often said that the character of the Vedic god Agni is most transparent It is thereby suggested that, since Agai merely represents the divine personification of the natural element of fire and since fire is so closely related to human life there is hardly anything beyond that element of fire that one can and needs to know in the Rgvedic mythology concerning Agni A critical study of that mythology, on the background of the study of the history of religion in general, would, however, clearly show that the concept of Agni must have originally developed in complete isolation from the natural element of fire It was only seconda rily, and as an after thought, that it was brought in relationship with fire symbolism Had Agnt represented just a deification of the natural phenomenon of fire, that phenomenon having been so close to man, we would have been justified in expecting to find the counterparts of the Vedic Agni in the mythologies at least of all the Indo European peoples But actually we do not find them It is not my intention, in this lecture, to elucidate this my view point any further I shall only repeat that the natural ele ment of fire could not have been the starting point of the Agoje mythology in the Veda One of the main strands in the basic
ASPECTS OF AGNI-MYTHOLOGY
297
concept underlying that mythology is, to put it in simple terms, the notion of a priest, of an efficient and ever-active intermediary between gods and men, of a dūla, of a purolira, revij, and hotr. The nature and functions of a data and a priest are of course manifold, and they are sought to be represented through the Agni-mythology in many ways.
One of the most significant mythological motifs, in this con nection, is the close relationship between Agni and the Angirases. In nearly all the passages where the word arigiras occurs in the singular, it is an epithet of Aggi. Agai is the first Angiras (1. 31. 1): fram agne prathanio arigirah. He is also the ancient Angiras pūrvo angirah (X. 92. 15), or the oldest of the Angi rases arigirasain jyestha (I. 127.2), or the most inspired among them vepistho arigirasām (VI. 11.3). In RV I. 75. 2 and many other passages, Agni is, indeed, referred to as angirastama. I do not propose here to go into the details of the history of the Aigirases. The Angirases are evidently an ancient historical clan, and, in view of many families of the Rgvedic seers as also individual rsis claiming relationship with the Angirases, BERGAIGNE seems to be right when he speaks of &ldquo;a whole common primitive liturgy of the Angirases &ldquo;.18 To the Angirases certainly belongs a distinct, and, in many cases, unique, tradition of cult and mythology. The strikiog rivalry of the Angirases with the Adityas, their ritualistic innovations, such as, arigirasām ayang and dvirätra, and angirast agniciti and argirasi rašanā, their undisputed mastery over ghora or abhicára rites, their much celebrated tapas, their successful operations against the Paris - all this has endowed the Angirases with a position peculiarly their Own. The Angirases represent, according to the Veda, a kind of deified ur-priests - they are the hallowed ancestors of the entire priest-community. Accordingly, they are also regarded as the most efficacious dūlas or envoys. Indeed, it is this latter aspect of their character which is stressed through their game. There is little doubt that the word argiras is to be philologically connected

with the Persian loan word in Greek, namely, aggaros, which means &ldquo;a riding Persian postal messenger' Herodot (VIII 98) speaks about the necessary qualities of the aggareion (which latter is obviously a Persian word) Aischylos ( Ag 273 ) refers to the sigoal fire, by means of which destiny was announced to Ilion&rsquo;s home, as aggaron pūr 17 It may, therefore, be presumed that the Greek word aggeros (aggello), meaning &lsquo;messenger&rsquo;, is related, from very early times, to the Aryan words, Vedic angıras and Persian Greek aggaros From Greek, that word was borrowed in Latin ( where it became angelus ), in Gothic (where it became aggilus ), and in Celtish (where it became aingel) Other Germanic languages then took it over from Gothic, and we have engel in new high German, Danish, Swedish and Dutch, angel in English, and angele in old French The angels are the messengers of gods - they are the intermediaries between gods and men And that is also one aspect of the basic character of the Angi rases Naturally enough, Agni, who is regarded as the priest cum intermediary par excellence, is most appropriately designated as angırastama
This interpretation of the word angiras, derived from a philological consideration of that word, receives confirmation from another source in close proximity with the Angirases is mentioned in the RV another group of ancient priests and seers, namely, the Navagvas Like the Angirases, the Nayagvas also are called our old fathers - nah purie pitarah (VI 22 2) Like the Angirases, again, the Navagvas play a very prominent role in the winning of the cows held in confinement by the Panis (I 62 3-4, V. 45 7, X 108 8) The word navagia has been explained in a variety of ways For instance, it has been suggested, on the analogy of the seven rsis, that the Navagvas are the priests going in a set of nine As an artificial extension of this concept of the Navagvas, the Vedic poets then thought of the Dasagvas (or those priests who went about in 2 set of ten) With the help of these Daśagvas, who, like the Navagvas, are closely associated with the Angirases (X 62.6),

Indra is said to have successfully fought Vala (I 624) BLOOM FIELD understands the Navagyas and the Daśagvas as being the priests, who respectively win as daksinā nipe and ten cows apięce 18 According to a third view, the Navagvas and the Daßagvas are priests, who are experts in the matter of sacrifices extending over Dine or ten days This entire play on numbers, however, looks suspicious From such Rgvedic words as etagva and anthgva, it seems certain that the element -gra in naragia is to bc derived from the root sam The element nava, in that case has to be understood 10 the sense of new' or ' newly' One is reminded, in this context, of Latio nuntius, which, as is well known, may go back to nouo-uenn os (with the haplological shortenipg of the syllable), meaning &ldquo;coming as a new one. More or less similarly is also formed the old high German, nu chomo 19 The compound, nava gva, would thus rfean going or coming as a new one'-semasiologically further extended to mean &lsquo;a new comer&rsquo;,
one who arrives newly and as such brings in fresh tidings and reports', &lsquo;a messenger&rsquo;, or an envoy' In other words, naragia ss, in a sepse, a close synonym of angıras However, people soon lost sight of this original sense of the word naragva (and also of angiras), Navagva, like Angiras, became a proper noun In view of the concept of the seven rsrs, the element nava came to be interpreted as pine, and the Navagvas came to deoote the priests going 1D ride. The word daśagia was then artificially coined by way of an analogous extension of the word naiagra
It is, indeed, significant that the Navagvas also are closely associated with Ago (cf so this context RV VI 6 3) in RV III 39 5 sakha lia jaira sahhibhir naragrair abhuñva sallabhır gā anugman, the word navagra seenis to have been used in its original sense It should be further noted that, while, in this passage, the Dalagvas are mentioned as being &lsquo;top&rsquo;, thc Navagras occur with out any such numerical specification Indra is here said to have echicycd, with the help of the Navagvas (and the Dasagvas ),

what he is usually described as achieving with the help of the Angirases, namely, the freeing of the cows and the finding out of the sun
One of the commonest features of the Agni mythology is the emphasis placed in the RV on the triple character of Agni. It is, indeed, asserted that no cosmological fact is more frequently alluded to in the RV than this three fold division of fire There are as many as seventy passages in that Veda, where this division is referred to with or without some form of the numeral &lsquo;three&rsquo;, RV III 20 2, for instance speaks of Agni&rsquo;s three powers, his three tongues, and his three bodies
agne tri te vajina tri sadhastha tisras te jihā rajata purvih/
tisra u te tanvo devavātās tabhir nah pahı giro aprajucchan // In RV III 29, gods are said to have purified three kindlings (sandhah) of Agni, of these, one they assigned to man (martye) for enjoyment, and two went to the sister world (u lokan jamım) Threefold, indeed, are the births of Agni, according to RV IV 1 7 trir asya fa parama santı satya spărha devasya janimany agneh RV X 45 I says First, Agni was born in the heaven, the second time, from us, and the third time, he was born among the waters divas para prathamam jajñe agnir asmad dvitiyam pari
atayı dah/ trdijam apsu nrmana gjasrani indliana enam jarate svaduh// Elsewhere, the order of Agais abodes is given as heaven, earth, and waters (VII 44. 16, X 27, X 46 9) or as ocean, heaven, and waters (I 95 3) It is usually believed that the three forms of Agni are Surya in the heaven, Agni on the earth, and lightning in waters Terrestrial and solar fire, as being permanent and appearing every day, were paturally regarded as the first and the second forms, while ys Geeting and 125er warfes tation was looked upon as the third
Incidentally, it has been suggested by MACDONELL that this threefold nature of Agni, so clearly recognised in the RV, IS probably the prototype not only of the posterior triad of Sun, Wind, and Fire ( VIII 18 9), which is spoken of as distributed in the three worlds (cf X 158 1), but also of the triad of Sun,

Indra, and Fire, which though not Rgvedic, is still ancient 20 Here, according to MACDONELL, Vata or Väyu and Indra have taken the place of Agni Vaidyuta the lightning Agni, as the Brahmanas and the comnientators call him
There is in the RV, a divinity called Apām Napāt which is celebrated in one whole hymn (II 35), is jovoked in two verses of a fymp to the waters (X 30 344) and is mentioned by name nearly thirty times altogether in that Veda 21 Three disttoctive features of the nature of that divinity are supposed to have been clearly brought out from the descriptions in the RV, namely, dwelling and concealment in the waters, swiftness, and fierincss These are the essential features also of lightning It is therefore, presumed that Apum Napat is a divinity of lightning Now the facts such as that Agnt is sometimes directly referred to as Apām Napāt II 143 1. VS 8 24 ) and Apām Napát is inı oked as Agoi ( II 35 15) that Agni is characterised as apām garbha (III 1 12-13, VIT 9 3 ) and that he is also called adreh sūnu *son of the rock' (X 20 7 ) seem to suggest that the Vedic poet thought of Agni and Apām Napāt as being identical The conclusion then becomes irresistible that Apām Napat is the name given to Agni as produced from the waters in the form of lighting In other words Apam Napat represents the third or the lightning form of Agni MACDONELL who strongly advo cates this view, further says that the Vedic god Trita also is no other than the third or the lightning form of Agar 22 That Tnta is a dividity of lightning is MACDONELL believes, supported by all the Rgvedic passages relating to him Lightoing is the chief agent in the thunderstorm and its manifestation precedes the release of the heavenly waters According to MACDONELL, It is thus a matter of course that Trita should be associated with Indra in the conflict with the drought fiend He is further naturally identified with the celestial steed the personification of lightning as having in the highest degree the quality most distinc

tive of horse His connection in this character with the Maruts and the rain-cloud, his thundering and his descent to the earth are po less clear Trita&rsquo;s relation to Agni is quite obvious, indeed, he is actually identified with Agni Like Trita, Agou also is frequently associated with Indra Similarly the celestial steed is brought in close relationship with Agni Agni&rsquo;s epithet virahan and his connection with the Maruts also need to be noted in this context Now, since Agni has a lightning form this identification of Trita with Agni must be regarded as referring to that form The exclusive epithet of Trita, namely Āptya, (from ap / ap &ldquo;water') is quite significant in this connection, for, it confirms the essential identity between Trita Āptya and Agni Apām Napat The two divinities have this feature, namely, of being born of waters, in common, and it is shared by no other divinity
H W MAGOUN also emphasizes the original lightning character of Apām Napāt 23 But, according to him, Apām Napāt Tepresents a form of lightning which is different from the one represented by Agn Following KAEGI and BLOOMFIELD, MAGOUN asserts that there can be no doubt that Agni is originally a god of lightning the lightning that strikes and leaves fire behind it But he adds that the fact that Agpi still retains his character as lightning in parts of the RV is, of itself no reason for identifying him wuth Apām Napat According to him, while Agni is lightning - probably the blinding flash - and fire (and later the sun also ) Apam Napāt is lightning in its most remarkable and conspicuous form, namely, the distant descending bolt, the fascinating and awe-inspiring &lsquo;chain lightning&rsquo;, which, like a molten stream of fire, seems to reach from heaven to earth This is “the swift horsed, the tall and shining lord” of the Avesta, and this is also the Vedic god who, erect, clothed with light, betakes himself to the bosom of the oblique ones&rdquo; and “ whom stallions swift as thought, convey&rdquo; According to MAGOUN, it is sufficiently clear that the country to the north of the Hindu Kush and to the east of the Caspian is a region of

fearful thunderstorms That the phenomena observed in storms of this kind should not excite the religious imagination of such a people as the Indo-Iranians is hardly to be thought of How did the Inda-Iranians worship the lightning? MAGOUN says that it was in three ways firstly, as a smrtiag fire god, the Vedic Agni Vrtrahan, secondly, as a wonderful and brilliant child of waters, Apám Napāt, who personified the phenomenon of chain lighting, and, lastly, as a heavenly manifestation, to which, for lack of a befter name, they gave the title Third, that is Vedic Trita, who is probably to be recognized in the highly anthropomorhic Avestan Thraetaona Āthwia
Three main points emerge out of the fore-going hypothesis (1) that Agni and Apām Napat are identical, (2) that the original character of Apām Napāt is that of a lightning divinity, and (3) that, therefore, that divinity is to be identified with the lightning form of Agni Incidentally, in fairness to MAGOUN whose view has been referred to above, it must be added that it is only the second of these points which he emphasizes
While trying to controvert these points, I should like to be gin by stating that, in the RY, Agni and Apām Napāt are hardly anywhere properly identified An analysis of the Apam Napāt passages would prove quite revealing in this connection These passages may be broadly classified in four groups To begin with, there are passages in which the existence of Apám Napāt as an independent divinity is clearly established For instance, the only entire hymn that is addressed to Apām Napāt, namely, II 35, belongs to this class Although the final verse of this hymn (II 35 15) meptions Agni, it has apparently nothing to do with the rest of the hymn and is obviously a later addition made for the sake of the refrain Then there are references to Apām Napät in other hymns, mostly in the hymns to All gods (cf II 31 6, VI 50 13, 52 14, VII 35 13, X 92 13) Agni also is mentioned in these hymns, but quite separately from Apām Napät And there is nothing in these hymns which might even remotely imply the identity of these two divinities Thirdly, there are passages in which Apām Napāt is clearly distinguished from Agni One304

such passage is VI 13 3, where Agni, the wise one, the Order-born, united with Apām Napāt, is said to make the sage prosper with riches sa satpath savasa hantı yrtram agne vipro vi paner bharti vājam / jam tam praceta rtajata rāyā sajosa naptra &lsquo;pām hunosi // The phrase sajosa naptră apam leaves no doubt whatever that Ago and Apīm Napat were originally two different divinities As against this, there are passages — only two in number — where Agni is directly referred to as Apām Napāt In III 9 1, a hymn to Agni, napalam is used in apposition to a pronoun of the second person, which is repeated in the following stanza, where Agni is addressed by name Again, in the first verse of I 143, also a hymn to Agni, napät is an apposition to a relative pronoun, whose antecedent is agnaye 24 But, in view of the fact that, in I 22 6, Savits also is called Apām Napät, these two passages would seem to lose much of their probative value They have to be regarded as merely reflecting the tendency, which is special in respect of Agni, namely, of being identified with many gods By way of a diversion it may be mentioned here that the fact that Agni is said to assume forms of many gods (cf III 20 3) has been stressed by GUERINOT to prove his theory that Agni is the ur god 26 Now reverting to the point under discussion, I shall repeat that an analysis of the Apām Napāt passages in the RV indicates not only that Agni and Apānı Napāt are not identified with each other in that Veda but also that they are regarded as two essentially different divinities
A critical consideration of the descriptions of Apām Napát in the RV would further place it beyond doubt that not only are Agni and Apām Napāt not identical but the essential character of Apām Napāt also is not that of a lightning divinity Apim Napat is characterised as radya bora of rivers&rsquo; (135 1) The beaming waters are said to stand round about the beaming, shin jog Apām Napat tam u sucim sucaj o didnamsam apam napalam pari tasthur apah (JI 35,3) The not pouting young purifying

It will be seen that, in all these passages, it is essentially the aqueous (or watery) character of Apam Napát that is empha sized, rather than the igneous (or fiery) character There are some references in these passages, which are suggestive of light but not of fire, of shining&rsquo; but not of burniog&rsquo; Besides, many of these references, it should be noted, arc purcly conventional, they are such as may be made to relate to any Vedic god What is perhaps far more significant from our present point of view is that, in none of tbese and other passages, is Apām Napát asso. ciated with clouds&rsquo; as such Surely, the concept of lightning is difficult to comprehend without a mention of the thunderbolt Lightniog, it must be remembered, is 1 child of thundering clouds,

rather than of waters (even if these latter are understood as rain waters) Actually one feels inclined to think that the waters with which Apām Napāt is associated are not rain-waters at all Indeed, the descriptions of Apām Napāt are generally too mild to be regarded as reflecting the phenomenon of lightning and thunderbolt
I have already said that the starting point of the Agni-mytho logy in the Veda is by no means the natural element of fire The basic misconception that Agni exclusively represents fire is here unduly extended to suggest that one form of Agni camely, Agni in waters represents lightning The tendency to see in the Vedic mythology the mythology of thunder and lightning, which was once very prominent, is mainly responsible for this extension of notions When a Vedic poet speaks of Agol in water, he is giving expression to a thought which lives in itself, which is self evident, he is not repeating something which had become un understandable It must surely be a thought pertaining to some thing other than lightning Without going into any details, I may suggest that the relationship between Agni and waters is closely connected with the relationship between water and plants Rgvedic passages such as I 70 3 145 5, X 4 5, 51 3 etc, are highly suggestive in this context Perhaps much more suggestive are the passages VII 93 apam garbhah prasva å viveśa, the embryo of the waters has entered into the sprouting plaats, VIII 43 9 apsv agne sadlis tava sau &lsquo;sadhir ann rudly ase, in the waters, O Agni, is your station, you grow up in the form of plants
In the Avesta, we have the counterpart of Vedic Apām Napát The Avestan Apām Napat is clearly a spirit of waters, he lives in the depth of waters and is usually invoked with them He is rich in rapid steeds (which seem to represent the billowing waves) and controls the distribution of water over the earth Yasht 19 51 says “This glory got the start upto the sea Vourukasha Straightaway Apám Napāt, whose steeds are swift, seized it, and this was the wish of Apam Napāt, whose steeds are swift I shall seize this glory, the unattainable, at the bottom of the deep sea, at the bottom of the profound lakes&rdquo; And Yasht

19,52 continues “We praise the lofty, fordly Apām Napīt, (genus) of women, brilliant, whose steeds are swift, virile, hearing prayer, who created men, who shapxd men, the angel beneath the waters, who hath the most attentive car when he is praised » According to ashe S 4. “from Apām Napat doth come the seed (cihrem) ” The epithet Khsatlırım, which is used in the Aresta exclusively with reference to Anim Napīt, is very significant in this content On the basis of translations like Sanskrit srāmi narinam (Or strirani ), the meaning of Xhcathrin is fixed as “lord of women&rsquo;. This may then bt regarded as an evidence that the divinity in question is “the symbol of the fructifying principle contained in the waters&rsquo; Incidentally it must be emphasized that it is wrong to presume that the primitive peoples were incapable of abstract symbolism or that their symbolism was often startlingly realistic We may, therefore, conclude from the passages, which have been quoted above, and similar other passages that the Avestan Apun Napat has nothing to do with fire or lightning, but that he basically represents &amp; water divinity &ndash; perhaps the divinity which symbolises the fructi fying principle contained in waters
Evidence from the Vedic ritual also does not seem to support the identification of Apam Napät with Agni For instance, RV X 30 (which is one of the two liymns relating to Apām Napit) is prescribed to be employed in the nites which have to do with water and not fire The hymn is more or less unified in character so far as its subject matter is concerned, and it is to be recited by the Hotę at the fetching of water for sacrifice There is prescribed in connection with this rite also an offering to be made to Apām Napāt in water The mantra prescribed for this offering is VS 6 27 deyir āpo apām napad jo ia irmur hansja indriyavān madintamah/tam deveblyo devatra darta Stihrapebhyo jesam
bhaga stha siaha Apam Napāt is invariably invoked to promote proper dispensation of water He plays an important role in the Kārlrisn, which is intended as a riturl for rain (cfTS II 481) It is also significant that, according to Kaiss 23 4 14, the prajašcitia rite, prescribed in the event of the sacrificial animal

dying in water, consists of an oblation of cooked rice to Apām Napāt 26 Thus, the lightning hypothesis does not receive any support from any Vedic evidence of a primary character It is only secondary sources, such as the commentary on TS IV 14 or the ritual of what may be characterised as adbhuta type, which at all mention lightning
Anthropological and ethnographical materials such as have been brought forth by TYLOR (Anfang der Kultur ), BRINTON (Religions of Prunime Peoples ), LANG (Mythes, cultes et reli gion), and CROOKE ( Popular Religion) also point to the fact that lightning was never concieved of as an independent divinity by any primitive people Even in ancient saga literature, light ning is mentioned very rarely, if at all It may be presumed that the unsteady nature of lightning does not favour its development into a full fledged divinity
Three points have thus become quite clear, namely, (1) that Agni and Apām Napat are not identical, (2) that the essential character of Apām Napät is not that of a lightning dividity, but that he is a divinity related to water and (3) that Agni&rsquo;s asso ciation with water by no means represents his lighting form So far as the Agni mythology was concerned, the discussion about Apam Napāt might as well be concluded here But I shall throw out one suggestion Apām Napat was basically a diyoity of an ancient water cult, and, at some stage in the evolution of the Vedic mythology, this water cult was brought into relationship, on the one hand, with the cult of Agni (as the result of a confusion of symbolisms) and, on the other, with the cult of Soma (by way of a religio mythological extension) Indeed, if Apām Napāt was at all to be regarded as being close to any other significant mythological concept in the Veda, it would certainly not be Agai, it would be Soma 1
Attention may finally be drawn to one more peculiar feature of the Agni mythology in the Veda It will be observed that no

counterpart of the name Agoi as such exists in any other Indo European language The connection of the word agni with Latin ignis, Slavonic ognis, and Lithuanian ugnis is uncertain At any rate, these latter words never became appellations of any diyre pities, nor did they become centres of any religious cults As a matter of fact, there does not seem to have developed, in early times, any regular fire cult among the Indo European peoples other than the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians There were, no doubt, the two feminine divinities &ndash; the Greek Hestia and the Roman Vesta We are not here concerned with the question whether Vesta is a mere borrowing from Greece as KRETSCHMER suggests?? or whether she is essentially Roman as assumed by Warde FOWLER28 and FARNELL 29 What is relevant for our purpose is that these divinities are not associated with the fire of any developed cult of sacrifice, they are associated only with the fire of the hearth Even then, they must not be under stood as being related to sacra privata (as against sacra publica)
There are, however, clear indications that a regular cult of sacrificial fire had developed among the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians Presumably, this cult developed during the common Aryan period, that is to say, during the period when the ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iraniaas lived together in the region round about Balkh, before their further threefold migration, namely, to Saptasındbu, to Iran, and to Mitaani,30 and when such religio mythological concepts as those of Asura Ahura and Soma Haoma were also evolved And, whatever the original character of Vedic Agni, there is little doubt that he soon came to be regarded as the centre of that cult so far as Indra was concerned There are many common points in the

sacrificial ritunl of the Vedic Indians and the ancient Iranians, though, it may be incidentally pointed out, the Vedic ritual ex hibited, in course of time, very complex and claborate ramifica tions This being so, it is rather strange that a linguistic counter part of such a common Vedic word as agni should not occur prominently in the Avestan language 31 The Avestan cult which corresponds to the Vedic Agni cult centres round Āthar And it us interesting to notc that a form closely related to the Avestan word athar occurs in the RV, in a solitary instance, namely, Vedic atharyu, which is an epithet of Agni (cf vil 1 1) It has been rightly pointed out that the word atharyu is related to the word atharian in the same way as riajul, suninaju, and yaj u are related respectively to rtavan, suminävan, and yajvan 12 Accordingly, *arhar 1 to be regarded as the hypothetical base from which derivatives atharyu and athan an are formed There can be little doubt that this bypothetical Vedic *athar is the same as the Ave. stan athar Athar, it may be presumed, denotes a religio magi cal fluid or potence (more or less similar to asu,93 the only difference perhaps being that asn is a cosmic concept while athar is a ritualıştıc one) According to the peculiar primitive ideo logy, the sacrificial fire is looked upon either as possessing such magica) potence (atharyu ) or as itself being that magical potence (athar) - both the notions implying the same thing in the ulti mate analysis Atharvan is then the priest who is believed to possess such religio magical potence But Agni himself is some times called Atharvan (cf VIII 9 7) This is similar to what we have already seen, namely, that the Angirases are priests but that Agni also is called Angiras
The interpretation of athar, which has been given here, seems to receive confirmation from another Vedic passage in the eighth verse of RV IV 6, which is an Agni hymn, Agni, instead of being called atharyu, is referred to as atharyo na dania&ndash;&ldquo;like the

taoth of a certain female animal, which is supposed to embody the athar potencc &quot; Various views have been put forth on the question as to which particular animal is intended here For 10 stancc, PISCHEL suggests that the animal must be the elephant 34 Some scholars, on the other hand, think of a wild boar, while others of a hrsnamrgi But, evidently, the animal referred to 10 this context must be one which belongs to the sphere of some ancient cult Such a one could very well be a horse The facts that the mare Vispalā is called atları (I 112 10), that Dadhyan Atharvana is supposed to have had a horse head, and that the horse plays an important role in such rites as the pra argja and the agnicılı seem to support such an assumption
As is well known, at one stage in the history of ancient India, sacrifice became the symbol of the Vedic Aryan culture and Agni came to be recognised as the symbol of sacrifice In this sense, Agni was often regarded as the central character in the great drama of the Aryan expansion in India This is, for instance, what we scc in the legend of Gotama Rābūgana and Videgha Mäthava, who, according to ŚPBr I 4 1 10 ff, were the pioneers of the Aryanisation of Eastern India as I sometimes think that, in this historical context, Agoi se assumed, as it were, his original role It has been already pointed out that Agn was ongioally conceived as dūra, as the covoy of the gods, as the Successful intermediary between gods and men la historical times, Agni again became duia, the envoy of Vedic culture, the vanguard of Aryanisation, the successful intermediary between the Aryans and the non Aryans

“ VEDIC GOD VARUNA &quot;</p>
<p>(Let me at the outset pay my tribute of piety and friendship to the reverently cherished memory of Professor VISHVA BANDHU, who, through his selfless and dedicated service extend. ing over half a century has done more than any other person 10 recent times for the promotion of Vedic studies and research We are all quite familiar with the various aspects of his magisterial work, and to dilate upon them on this occasion wovid be like the proverbial painting of the lily, guilding of refined gold, and adding of perfume to the violet
VISHVA BANDHUJI was one of those rare personalities who built their own monuments during their life time We do not need to erect any fanciful memorial for VISHVA BANDHU, all that we have to do is solemnly to pledge oursclves to the task of ensuring that the activities of the great Institute for which he lived and died—the Vishveshvarananda Vedic Research Institute-progress uphampered, solidly and fruitfully
Nearly twenty years ago, while Professor VISHVA BANDHU and I were serving on the Government of India&rsquo;s Sanskrit Commission—he as a member and I as the Member Secretary we had several occasions to travel together VISHVA BANDHUJI then noticed that I was in the habit of occasionally humming verses from the Rgieda-and these, more or less exclusively drawn from the Varuna hymns of the seventh Mandala He asked me why those particular hymns enchanted me I replied that Varuna was the special god of the Vasisthas and then added with a hint of mock seriousness, that I was a Vasistha (1 ani a Vasistha)

VISHVA BANDHU evinced great interest in that observation of min&rsquo;, which eventually came to be a topic of frequent friendly discussion Vhen I was invited to deliver there Vishra Bandhu Memoral Lectures, I thought that this would, indeed, be a proper theme for any discourse, namely, &ldquo;A Vedic god (that is, Varuna) and a Vedic seer (that is, Vasistha)&rdquo;
I do not think that it is necessary to recount to an audicace such as this all that is said in the Raieda about Varuna I shall, honeser, say this much, namely, that any theory regarding the personality and character of Varuna, to be convincing, must fulfil two minimum conditions (1) it should take into account the basic and essential features of the Rgsedic Varuna, and (2) it should be possible, on the basis of that theory, to orginize those features into reasonably well structured religio-mythological pattern These basic and essential features are Varuna as the special guardian of rta, Varuna as Asura par excellence, Varuna&rsquo;s letters, Varuna&rsquo;s maja, Varuna&rsquo;s unisersal sovereigoty, Yaruna&rsquo;s intimate association with Mitra, and the rivalry between Varuda and Jadra Some years ago in a comprehcnsive paper on Asura Varuna,&rdquo; I had critically examined various vcws about Varuna, such as, Varuna 25 the shy god (ROTII, SCHROEDER, BLOOMFIELD), Varuna as the god of night (JJ MEYER), Varuna (like Vrtra) as the restrainer of water (BERGAIGNE, JOHANSSON), Varuna as the chtlionic fertility god (JJ. MEYER), Varuna as the moon god (OLDENDERG, HILLCR ANDT), and Varun as the occan god (PISCHEL), and had shown them to be quite unacceptabic Today I shall examinc some other theories about Varuny, which have been advanced in recent times, and then set forth my own Vicws on the subject
One of the most outstanding works on Varuna, published in recent times, is that of Heinrich LUDERS&rsquo; Luckily for us, it was possible to salvage this magnuni opus, to a fairly large extent,

from the ncar devastation which its manuscript had suffered at the hands of mindless marauders after the sccond world war LUDERS begins by setting forth some of the main features of his methodology He does not accept the principle enunciated by several carlier Vedists, likc OLDENBERG and HILLCBRANDT, Damely, that the Veda ought to be interpreted primarily with the help of the Vedi itself He does not approve of &lsquo;isolating&rsquo; the Veda by ignoring in this manner the traditional scholastic interpretation and the subsequent literature He believes that pre classical and classical Sanskrit texts have grown in the same spiritual climate as the Veda and may, indeed, be regarded as representing a dependable continuity of Indian tradı tion Further, it is always expedient to try to intcrpret the &ldquo;unknown' by relating it to something which is definitely known According to LUDERS, one must needs approach the text of the Veda without any preconceived notions concerning the Vedic religion and mythology In this context, he strongly objects to the assumption of a physical phenomenon as the basis of each and every Vedic god, which assumption has given rise to a perplexing multiplicity in the Veda of sun gods and moon gods and rain gods * He also insists that the etymological analysis of the name of a Vedic god is by no means a sure starting point in the matter of investigating the true nature of that god Further more, LUDERS says that it is wrong to suppose that the Vedic Rsis always meant something other than what they actually said, that, in other words, they used language only to conceal their thoughts He criticises the eclectic method of many earlier Vedists and takes to tash such of them as were wont to brand Vedic thought as primitive
All this is, no doubt, more or less unexceptionable But the conclusions which LUDERS has arrived at after an apparently thorough going study of all the Vedic passages referring to Varuna are, unfortunately, not so LUDERS line of argument, as I understand it, is something like this

In the Vedic as well as the post Vedic and the classical Sanskrit literature, Varuna&rsquo;s dwelling place is said to be waters At the same timc, in the RV, Varuna is also associated with the heaven According to LUDERS, these two beliefs are by no means mutually contradictory For, the Vedic cosmology regards the heaven as the proper home of waters Indeed, the heavenly and the earthly waters are identical and Varuna is connected with both 5
Varuna is also most closely connected with rta LUDERS devotes the major part of the second volume of his great work to the lexical and conceptual consideration of rta He asserts that rta is the exact equivalent of satya and means nothing more than Wahrheit or truth In classical Sanskrt, the word satza, in such compounds as satyanrte, is clearly used to denote the opposite of anrta, that is to say, to denote ria LUDERS traces back this very sense, namely rta=satya=truth through the Brahmanas, to the RV He claims that, in all the Rgvedic passages where the word rta occurs, the meaning truth' fits in very well Of course, this basic meaning does show various secondary ramifications, but, LUDERS insists, the word rta in the RV ncver denotes any. thing like cosmic order
Varuna resides among waters and 15 the guardian of truth There is another concept which is closely associated with truth and waters simultaneously, and that is the concept of oath An oath is a solemn affirmation, made usually with an appeal to God for the truth of what is affirmed, and, according to the ancient Indian tradition water had to be invariably used while taking oaths LUDERS, therefore, concludes that Varuna, who is asso ciated with truth and waters, is the god of oath, which too is
5 Incidentally. Luepers alds that Varuna is nowhere ident ficd with water, nor is he anywhere represented as a water god According to him, there is no masculine water god in the Veda

associated with truth and waters He points out that it is in Varuna&rsquo;s nature as the god of oath that we have to seek the origin of his kingship The oath god Varuna, as the guardian of rta or truth, discerns truth and falsehood, he acts as a judge and punishes the violator of truth - he thereby comes to be regarded as the sovereign lord LUDERS accepts MEILLET&rsquo;s suggestion that Mitra is essentially a god of contract and says that it confirms Varuna&rsquo;s character as the god of oath, for, like Mitra and Varuna,
contract and oath are closely connected with each other
I find LUDERS' reasoning quite unconvincing It is, indeed, difficult to accept that rta and salja are exactly synonymous In many Vedic passages, the words rta and satya are used side by side and this, not just by way of stylistic variation Comment ing on AV IX 5 21, sarjam ca rtam ca caksusi, LUDERS says that satja and rta are the two eyes, which latter are two exactly identical entities, therefore, satya and rta too must be regarded as being identical It may, however, be pointed out that the two eyes are not identical but that they are complementary Ria and satya also are not identical, but they are complementary This is confirmed by TS V 1 58 rtam salyam ity aha, ayam (that is Prthvi) 1ā riam, asau (that is Dyaus ) saryam In AV XII 5 10, rta and satja are celebrated with various mutually complementary pairs such as payas and rasa, anna and annadya, ista and pūrta, prajā and pašu In this context, W Norman BROWN suggests Rgvedic man saw the universe in two parts. One in which the gods and men live-sar, below the earth there is the place of horror inhabited only by demons - asar, to make the sat operate perfectly, every creature had its duty, his personal function (vrata), and when he lived by it he was an observer of ria One may not agree with all that BROWN says, but there is certainly a point in his suggestions that sat is, in a sense, the result of rta and that vraia and rta are closely related to each other
7 According to LUEDERS, the concepts of the oath god and the contract god have originated among the Aryans They do not go back to the Indo European period, nor can they be shown to have been borrowed from any forcago BOURCES

Again, it is not only in classical Sanskrit that we come across the compound sat, anrte, wherein the word satja is claimed to have replaced the word rta which had become more or less extinct in the mean time The compound occurs even in the RV (cf VII 49 3 sarjanrte aapasjan janänăm), when the word rta was still quite alive And if ra and satja Wcre synonyms, why should only the word rta have almost disappeared in later litera ture? The reason obviously was that the two words denoted two different concepts, and that, in the course of the evolution of ancient Indian religio philosophical thought, only the concept of ria had been superseded by other newly arisen and equally signifi cant concepts like brahman and dharma Further, it is strange that LUDERS should have sought to determine the meaning of rta from that of anria, or to interpret the Vedic usage with the help of the classical Sanskrit usage And is druh not often used - both in the Veda and the Aresta -to denote the opposite of na? And druh certainly does not mcan only untruth'-t has a far wider connotation The Avestan aša which is believed to be the exact equivalent of the Vedic sta— both linguistically and concep tually represents, according to NYBERG, the riche course of nature or the well regulated life The Vedic rta too has an unmistakable cosmic nuuoce which cannot be adequately expressed by translating that word with mere truth'
To connect Varuna with oath because he is said to have waters as his abode and water is used wlule swearing is patently farfetched These two ideas belong to two altogether different thought worlds LUDERS' reference to oath water having been regarded, in the Indo European period, as a representative of the water of the world of the deid would, indeed, seem to vitiate his own argument One my also ask whether the characterisation of Varuna as the god of oath was not too much restricted It can certainly not be said to cover all the essential traits of that god&rsquo;s personality It is also not understandable why the god of oath should have been clevated to such a pre cminent position in the

VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
Rgvedic religion and mythology Why should oath have played such a prominent role in the Vedic thought complex? There are hardly any significant passages in the RV where oath' as such has been even mentioned The concept of oath can by no means be considered to be of such vital importance that the god, who is believed to preside over it, should come to be regarded as the majestic Asura
THIEME in his book Mitra and Aryaman,10 unquestioningly accepts MEILLET&rsquo;s formula, namely, that the Indo Iranian god Mitra is nothing but contract deified He then goes on to say that, if Mitra is the personification of an ethical abstract, so must also be Varuna who is closely associated with him. He thus discoun tenances (and I fully agree with him in this respect the theories of BERGAIGNE, OLDENBERG, HILLEBRANDT, and others, who have sought to explain the two gods as the personifications of natural phenomena THIEME also whole heartedly supports LUDERS' suggestion that rta means &lsquo;truth &ndash; and nothing but truth. He is indeed, so very enthusiastic about this that he hails LUDERS for having, once for all, banished from Vedic philology the equation rla cosmic order But THIEME is not inclined to accept LUDERS&rsquo; subsequent suggestion that Varuna is the god of orth LUDERS derives the word saruna from the root yrito enclose, and then asserts that varuna meaning that which closes in' is a designation of the concept of oath' and that Varuna is Oath personified
THIEME would rather agree with MEILLET that the word varuna — and possibly also yrafa (which, according to THIEME means ' vow')- may be derived from the IE root ver &lsquo;to speak&rsquo;. However, while going along with MEILLET on two points, namely, that Mitra personifies contract and that the word aruna may be derived from IE ver to speak', THIEME doubts 111s conjecture that the appellative meaning of aruna can be law' * order' THIEME believes that a law' is enforced by an orga

In fine, THIEME combines parts of two distinct theories — namely, LUDERS equation rta = truth and MEILLET&rsquo;s deri Talion of saruna from the JE ver &lsquo;to speak&rsquo; -and proposes that Varuna means &ldquo;true speech His entire formula relatiog to the religious ideology centering round the three principal Adityas (which formula he claims to be of a systematic character is Varuna “True Speech', Mitra “Contract', Aryaman Hospita lity' THIEME says that the common moral functions of God Contract and God True Speech arc, of nccessity, governed by one great principle they discover and punish untruth and protect truth in this statement, THIEME has at least used the words God Contract and God True Speech, actually, however, he seems to think that even the names Mitra and Varuna occurring in the RV can be adequately translated respectively with (mere) Con tract and (mere) True Speech For instance

Schiller and that for the Vedic Rsis as GONDA has rightly poin tcd out 16 the powers invoked and addressed were ad awesome and majestic reality determining their conditions of life and their very cxistence in this world and the hereafter'
The French Mythologist, G DUMÉZIL, Persists in upholding the equation Varuna = Ouranos 17 However, he derives the words not from uer— &lsquo;to encompass, to enclose&rsquo;, but from der-&lsquo;to fasten&rsquo;, and thereby connects the tivo gods not, as is usually done, with the concept of the encompassing sky but with that of the sovereign power He believes that both Ouranos aod Varuna symbolise the ancient myth of the first world king, who opposes his subjects and casts his sons in fetters and is deprived of his manly vigour, wbich latter cvcnt then results in the fructifica tion of nature According to DUMEZIL, all this is substantiated, on the one hand, by the ritual of the Rājasuya of which Varuna is the god, and, on the other by the Ouranos saga It is hardly necessary to emphasize that the relations which DUMEZIL seeks to establish are quite tenuous (for instance, he tries to relate the isolated and late legend of Ouranos having cast his sods in chains to the equally isolated legend, narrated in the JBr ( 44 ) of Varuna&rsquo;s having punished his conceited son Bhrgu - the moti vation of the two legends is quite different ) and call for much violence to the texts At any rate, they can by no stretch of imagination be derived from the Rgvedic evidence
In his subsequent monograph on Mitra Varupa, 18 DUMÉZIL paints the characters of these two gods in very sharp colours He asserts that Mitra and Varuna represent a double concept of sovereignty, which, incidentally, he tries to fit in into his famous pattern of the tripartite mythological ideology of the Indo Euro peans and consequently of the Aryans consisting of the three basic functions, namely, that of priests or divine rulers (Mitra Varuna ), of warriors (Indra or Vayu) and of producers

(Asvinau ) 19 Mitra, according to DUMÉZIL, is the sovereigo 10 his clear, regal, calm, (I am quoting DUMÉZIL clear, regal, calm,) benevolent, sacerdotal aspect, while Varuna represents the assailant, sombre, inspiring, violent, terrible, warlıke aspect Mitra is braliman, Varuna king of Gandharvas 20 One, indeed, fails to understand on what text ual evidence DUMÉZIL bases his theory of such &lsquo;marked contrast between the two gods One would search in vain for the Rgvedic indications of the cogency of the long array of adjectives which the French scholar has used As a matter of fact, in the RV, Mitra and Varuna have never been presented in any clear-cut distinction from each other 21
I am tempted to characterise KUIPER&rsquo;s views about Varuna23 as somewhat chimerical To me they sound too abstract and alien According to KUIPER, Varuna is the god of the primeval waters which belong to the pre-Indra world of Chaos These primeval waters are enveloped by the earth as a receptacle and are, accord ingly, to be identified with the hidded ocean&rsquo; under the earth It is, indeed, these waters which Iodra is said to have delivered at what KUIPER calls the second creation' Varuna can thus be regar ded also as the god of the nether world&ndash;verily, as the personifica tion of the regressive force of the nether world (as against Mitra who personifies the progressive force) KUIPER explains the term ānujayara employed with reference to the Devas 10 KS 279 through the assumption of the older gods of the nether world (Varuna, etc ) and the newer gods of the upper world (Iadra, etc )
19 ELIZARENKOVA thinks (UZTGVU Vypusk 201, 113-122 ) that, in the pre-RV state, the level of magic power represented by Mitra Varuna modelled all the three functions of the gods
20 COOMARASWAMY (AOS 22 1942 ) looks upon Metra Varuna as reprt senting the union of sacerdotium or sp ritual authority and regnum or temporal power, which is so very essential for the sustenance of Dharma (VIDENGREN (Numen I, p 23 ) speaks of Mitra representing the juristic priestly aspect of sovereign power and Varuna the magical aspect

Varuna and Mitra and Varuna arc often described in the RV as supporting the heaven and the earth (IV 42 4 dharayam dnam sadana rtasja, V 62 3 adhāraj atam prthivun uta djam mitrarājānā sarunā mahobhih) KUIPER vnderstands such passages too literally and suggests that the support can be given to the heaven and the earth only from below, that is, from the nether world, which, according to him, is Varuna&rsquo;s abode He apparently forgets that the root dhr in such contexts is not to be interpreted in its physical&rsquo; sense, but that it is to be interpreted in the sense of keeping alive', &lsquo;eosuring the proper functioning&rsquo;,
guarding against disintegration. As in such words as dhrtai rata Similarly, when Adityas arc said to be gabhira (II 273 ta idijāsa urojo gabhira) it is certainly not intended to suggest that they dwell in the depth of the earth
As against this, there is a clear mention in the RV of Varuna&rsquo;s abode being in the heaven (I 136 2 duk sam mulrasja sādanam aryamno varunassa ca, [ 1371 : rajana divisprša, II. 41 5 râjânay anabludruha dhrme sadası utame asāte, VII 34 24 dyukso sarunah, VIII 257 adhi jā brliato dno &lsquo;blu jūtheia pasi atak) We also come across references to rta, which is Varuna&rsquo;s special charge, operatiog in the heaven (V 621 rlena riam apıhutan dhiriam vam süryasya Jatra imucanty asian, V 631 rtasja gopā adhı tisthaiho ratham satj adharmāna parame
Jamanı) KUIPER&rsquo;s characterisation of Varuna as the god of the primeval waters under the earth can hardly be substantiated And where is the Ravedic evidence to support the peculiar cosmological roles which he assigos to Varuna and Indra? Equally far fetchediy conceived are KUIPER&rsquo;s notions that during the right the nether world is thought of as hanging over the earth o an inverted position, that Varuna&rsquo;s nether world thus cxtends over the earth as the night sky, and that therefore, Varuna is also the god of the night sky
After having thus shown that the theories about Varuna, recently put forth by LUDERS, THIEME, DUMÉZIL, and KUIPER are untenabic, I may now briefly state my own view regardiag the personality and character of that Rgvedic god I shall start324
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
with the assumption which, I believe, will be readily accepted by all, namely, that the character of the religion of a people 13 generally determined by the kind of life which that people lives And, since mythology is the most convenient medium through which the primitive man seeks to express his religious ideology, the mythology of a people also reacts and responds to the various vicissitudes in the cultural history of that particular people In other words, mythology is not a static phenomenon Vedic mythology also is not static-Vedic mythology, according to me, is essentially an evolutionary mythology Its general character has changed in accordance with the vicissitudes in the cultural life of the Vedic people For instance, it would be seen that a certain specific god was regarded as having been sovereign and supreme in a certain specific period The reason for this was that the character and personality of that god were in full conformity with what may be called the ethos of that period This is one aspect of the evolutionary mythology The other aspect of it is that, though the basic character of a particular god was determin ed by the peculiar environments in which he had come into being, that character did not remain static and stagnant through out That god necessarily possessed what may be called a
growing&rsquo; personality With the different vicissitudes in the Vedic way of life and thought, many new features gradually accumulated round that god so that his total personality presented a highly complex and heterogeneous picture I, however, believe that it is not altogether impossible to analyse the complex character and personality of a Vedic god, generally isolate from one another and thereby identify the various elements in that character, and then broadly mark out, with the help of compara tive philology, comparative mythology, anthropology and ethno logy, and the cultural history of the Vedic Aryans, the different stages in the evolution or the entire becoming' of that god
In an early period of their cultural history, the Aryans, that 1s to say, the ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the Avestan Iranians lived in the closest proximity and relationship with pature—they, indeed, lived as a part of (and not apart from )

nature It was, therefore inevitable that their primary religious ideology should have been conditioned by the peculiar manner in which they reacted to nature Their overwhelming experience of nature-the impact on their sensations and emotions of nature&rsquo;s vastness, brilliance, and bounty must have given rise to the religio mythological concept of the cosmic parents Dyāvāpsthivi the Father Sky and the Mother Earth It needs to be emphasised, in this context, that this was not a case of the desfication of the powers and phenomena of nature that is, in other words, of naturalistic mythology, but that it was a case of the concretisation and symbolisation of an independent religious feeling This concept of the cosmic parents thc Aryans seem to have had in common with several of their Indo European brethren The vital difference, however, tyas that, in the Aryan mythology, Dyauh pitar had his growth arrested–he did not attain the paramount position of the All Father like bis Greek and Roman counterparts The same was the casc with Prthivi who did not develop into anything like the Mother Goddess The reason why this aspect of the cosmic religion, namely, the one represented by the COSIDIC parents, did not become prominent in the Aryan mythology presumably was the fact that it had been soon superseded by another significant aspect of the cosmic religion Vastoess, as we kpow is usually associated with the ideas involving something that is haphazard, disorganized, unmotivated, and unregulated The Aryans, however, observed that the universe, vast though it was, was not disorganized or unregulated in all the functionings of the universe-big and small gross and subtle - they discovered a definite order and harmony, a regular pattern and scheme In other words, they realised that the universe, though vast was not chaos, but that it was cosmos There must be, they believed, a definite cosmic law which governed the universe, and there must also be a cosmic god who ensured the proper operation of that law This cosmic law is represented in the RV as ria, and the god who administers that law is Varuna
That the word rta in the RP docs not signify more truth of speech (as suggested by LUDERS) but that it cssentially has a

definite cosmic ethical connotation is too obvious to need any elaborate demonstration Onc has only to consider such passages as à pas latāna rodasi rlena (V I 7), aham apo apinvam uksa. mana dhāras am diam sadana rtasia Irtena puro aditer rläro la fridhātu prathaj ad vi bluma (IV 42 4), risro bhumir dhārajan frir uta dj in recrī dni (II 27 8), rieng visam bhuvanam 1 rājarah (V 63 7), rlam asasrann usaso nbhalih (IV 2 19 ), disādasiran nahi taj jarája variarii cairam pari djam riasya (1 164 11 ), to bc convinced of the nature of ria as a cosmic potence which creates and sustains the world and which cosures the health and strcogth of life in thc AV (VI 114 1,2, 134 1, X 8 31, etc ), rta is actually represented as a universal magic potence which is involed to overpower the spirits of cvil and disorder The oppositc of ria, namcly druh, implies, more than anything else, the violation of the cosmic and moral order, that is chaos&rdquo; Only secondarily, and presumably at a later stage, rta may have come to denote the kind of specch and action which is in unison with the cosmic order ria, which facilitates, manifests, and con firms the operation of that rta
The ctymology of the word la would seem to support the basic sense of that word suggested above The word ro is to be derived from the IE root ar-' to bind', &lsquo;to unite&rsquo;, to join to gether' According to BRUGMANN, Gk eirené (or iranā) 15 the reduplicated derivative from that IE root and means &lsquo;well joined together, holy bond&rsquo;, &lsquo;clever bringing together* There are some further derivatives from the IE ar - with an additional in the base, such as Gk artus systematically ordered&rsquo;. Lat artus &lsquo;well integrated in time and space&rsquo;, Mhd art inherent disposition', Arm arder &lsquo;Deatly structured&rsquo; It is to this series that the Vedic word rta belongs it means the holy bond &ndash; the unbreakablc, invulnerable law - which is the foundation of all natural phenomena and which binds them down to form a well ordered whole The phrase rtasja tantu (AV II 1 5, XIII 3 19) — the threads of ria — IS very suggestive in this context
24 The words, niti (= chaos) and ytu (= regularly occurring season ), pay also be profitably considered to this context
VEDIC GOD VARUNA
327
Elsewhere, the path of rta is said to be spun out by means of the threads of light (panthā rtasya samaj amsia rasmibhih , I 1362). It is, indeed, suggested that the words rta apd cosmos are semasio logically connected with cach other, for, the latter word also cap be traced back to the root kent - meaning &lsquo;to bind together 25
Varuna (and Mitra) are rtarrdh (I 23 5), the promoters of rta, Varuna 15 riasja gopå or rrayān par excellence He regulates the course of waters (II 28 4, rtam sındhavo varunasja Jantı) and controls and directs all the happenings in the universe. He is dlirtavrata - he sternly upholds his ordinances, no one dare oppose his great prowess (V 85 6 mājām malum nakır ädadharsa) Even gods obey Varuna&rsquo;s law (VIII 41 7 saril pasya sve deva anu vratam)
Varuna is enabled to accomplish the enormous feat of establi shing od sustaining the cosmic order, ria, because he is Asura
The word asura 18 made up of the noun asu and the possessive
ination ra (as in srira dhira, etc ), thus yielding the possessor of asu&rdquo;. At an early stage in the evolution of human thought, man believed that a cosmic magical fluid penetrated into all the aspects of creation and thereby invested them with the capability of being and becoming This all pervading cosmic magical potence was variously called as Mana, Orenda, etc Elsewhere I have tried to show that the Vedic asu is just another representative of that prinutive orendic concept 26 One who possesses this ast in the largest possible measure is, verily, the Asura Many gods arc rcferred to in the RV as asura, but there is no question that the Vedic pocts have clearly suggested that Varuna alone is the original and prccmincnt Asura (1 24 14, II 27 JD, 28 7, VJUI 42 1) Varuna, being thus endowed with the largest share of the cosmic magical potence, asu, is eminently
Gitted to act as the efficient implementer of the cosmic law na
It may be incidentally added, in this context, that the special power which Varuna derives on account of his being the Asura is

often referred to as maja (111 61.7 mahi mitrasja varunasja māja, V 634 majā vām muraiarunii dni śrtā, V 85 5: malum māsām sarunasia pra vocam. V 85 6 imam u nu havi. lamasja majam, Y 63 3 djam sarsaj alho asurasja mājajā, V 63 7. vratā rak selle asurasya mājajā ) The word maya may be derived from mumani or primite, which root means not only to measure&rsquo; but also to create', &lsquo;to arrange&rsquo;, etc Mājā thus represents, as GONDA suggests,the incomprehensiblc capa. city to plan or to orgadise something which is beyond the intelligence and powers of man t 15, indeed, from this point of view that Varuna is called jakşın (VII 88 6), thc awe inspiring miracle working magician And the working of the magic of Asura Varuda is picturesqucly described in V 85 2-6
How does Varuna establish the cosmic order? How does hc control and regulate the working of the universe? The etymology of the word jaruna would help us in answering these questions According to the most natural primitive vicw, one can effectively control and regulate a thing by binding it down, by confining it in fetters And this is exactly what Varuna is believed to be doing
The word vartına is to be derived from the IE root ver &lsquo;to biod&rsquo;. The other derivations, which have been suggested, such as from the root vr &lsquo;to cover&rsquo;, &lsquo;to enclose or from ver &lsquo;to speak&rsquo;, can be shown to be linguistically untenable Varuna is basically the binder god who controls and regulates all the happenings in the universe - cosmic as well as human &mdash;- by binding down their operators It is in tlus very concept that we have to seek the origin of the famous pašas of Varuna Varuna&rsquo;s pašas may be said to serve a double purpose — on the one hand, working in a subtle intangible way (setrblur arasubhik VII 84 2), they hold down the various entities in the universe in their proper places and thereby ensure their integrated functioning, and, on the other, they are employed by Varuna, the guardian of the cosmic ethical law, as instruments of punishment to the perpetrators of druh or anrta</li>

It would now be clear why Varuna is often referred to as Wielding supreme sovereign power (1 24 6 nahı te ksatram apuh, I 25 5 kada ksatraśrıyam naram a varunam karamahe, VII 34 11 anultam asmai ksatram sayu, VII 89 I mrla suksatra mirlaja) He is king (VII 64 1 raja suksatro varunah), the king of all dominions (VII 34 11 raja rastranam), the king of both gods and men (II 27 10 tvam vesve sam varuna &lsquo;st raja je ca dava asura je ca martah), the king of the whole world (V 85 3 visvasj a bluvanasja raja), iodced, the king of all that exists (VII 87 6 sato asya raja) He is the imperial ruler (11. 28 6 varuna samal raiah) Not even the minutest activity 10 nature and in human and animal life passes unnoticed by him The rising and the setting of the sun, the falling of rains, the growth of vegetation, the flowing of rivers, the flying of birds, even the winking of the eye (AV IV 16 5 Samkhyata asya nimiso janunam) are governed by the subtly working law of Varuna In his capacity of the world sovereign, he commands a large band of spies (1 25 13, VI 67 5, VII 61 3, 87 3 ), who, being undeceived, undismayed, and wise, keeply observe all the happenings in the universe and report to their master all cases of transgression of his law Varuna is the unfailing witness of men&rsquo;s truth and falsehood (VII 49 3 satyante ai apaśyan jananām), no one can escape from him even by fleeing far beyond the heaven (AV IV 164 ula yo dyan afisarpal parastan na sa mucyatai Tarunas) a rajñal)
Varupa s very intimate association with Mitra served as the starting point of several theories regarding the personality and character of Varuna It was taken for granted that the Vedic Mitra, like the Avestas Mithra was the sun god and on that basis, it was suggested that Mitras close associate Varuna was either the sky god or the moon god However, it is now more or less generally agrecd (as would be clear from GONDA&rsquo;s recent monograph, The Vedic God Mitra, 1972) that Mitra is not the sun god As a matter of fact, the Vedic evidence clearly points to the fact that Mitra docs not possess any individuality on the physical side In the RV there is only onc hymn, namely III 59,
330
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
which relates exclusively to Mitra I think that the initial words of that hymn, mitro janān jātajatı bruvānah, express the true character of that god “Mitra through his commands, sets people in their proper places&rdquo; It is needless to point out that the other interpretations of the word yātayali, such as, helps people to discharge their debts., * unites the people&rsquo;, &lsquo;exerts for the people&rsquo;, &lsquo;attaches himself to the people&rsquo;, are lexically and contextually unacceptable The analogous TBr passage (III 7 2 3.), mitro janan kalpayatı, would confirm the meaning of yātayatı suggested above Mitra is jātaj ajjana (III 59 5, VIII 102 12) and his main function is to control, regulate, and direct the affairs of men The word mura is to be derived from the IE root m(e) i - which also means &lsquo;to bind&rsquo; The original nominal derivative mitram (neuter means a bond - later a bond of friend. ship, and Mitra (mas ) is the name given to the god who esta blishes such bonds among the people and organises them more particularly in the moral sense The fact that the concept of mitra 15 connected with the concepts of dharing and rta (Y 81 4 mtro blavası deya dharmablul, VIII 52 3 yasmai visnus frını padā vicakrama upa mitrasya dharmabhih, X 8 4 rtaya sapta dadhise padāni jana yan nutram tanve siāyai) would confirm that god Mitra represents the personification of an ethical moral abstraction One, indeed, gets the impression that the Vedic Mitra has been conceived as a sort of alter ego of Varuna He shares Varuna&rsquo;s sovereign function Broadly speak ing, what Varuna is in respect of cosmic ethics, Mitra is in respect of human morality It is quite understandable that the binder gods, Varuna and Mitra, should have themselves been represented as the sons of Aditi (from the root da &lsquo;to bind&rsquo;) who personi fies ‘unboundedness&rsquo; Indeed, organization and regulation through bondage' is the central motif of an entire mythological complex involving rta, Varuna, Mitra, Aditi, and Adityas
The mythological concepts of the cosmic law rta and its ad ministrator the binder god Asura Varuna developed among the ancestors of the Vedic Indians and the Avestan Iranians presum ably when they lived together in the region of Balkh That

religio-mythological ideology was in full conformity with their peculiar way of life Soon, however, a significant cvent occurred in their history Some tribes from among the Aryans left their home in Ballh in scarch of nex adventure and fresh glory They set out in the direction of the land of seven rivers on a march of conquest and colonisation la this new phase of their cultural hfe the Vedic Aryans had to encounter various forms of opposi tron and obstruction irtrani — both natural and human They, therefore, yearned for a nen religion which would be consistent with their new way of life, to take place of their old cosmic reli gion A people on the war path needed a war god to inspire them This is briefly how Vrtraha Indra came to be born and how, soon after he had beco born, he became the foremost among the gods of the Rgredic pantheon (11 12 1 jo jata era pratha mah) 29
As was but to be expected, there arose, in course of time, a kud of rivalry beteen the ancient Varuna religion and the new Indra religion indications of which are not wanting in the RV (IV 42, X 124) This rivalry could have adversely affected the future of the Vedic culture if a Vedic seer with a refreshingly practical and realistic outlook had not made special efforts to bring about compromise and harmony between those two religions That seer was Vasistha 1</li>

<p>Vasistha, the seer of the seventh Mandala of the Rgveda, has played a very significant role in the cultural history of Vedic India Indeed, there is hardly any period of ancient Indian history as a whole on which Vasistha and his family have not left the special stamp of their almost inimitable individuality Vasi stha&rsquo;s position in the Rgvedic period is quite remarkable in this connection, a mention may be made of his divide origin and double birth, his active inyolvement in the Dasarajña which proved to be a more or less decisive factor in the socio political history of that period, and his outstanding contribution to the evolution of the Rgvedic religion and mythology As for the Athanaveda, Vasistha was believed to have been an expert in the Atharyanic practices and tore and was, therefore, regarded as having been specially qualified to officiate as Purohita Perhaps for the same reason, the office of Brahman in the Brahmanic ritual (which schematically belonged to the Atharvaveda) was usually assigned to a Vasistha (though he formally belonged to the Rgveda ) Like most of the other Rgvedic seers, Vasistba too was not prominent in the Upanisadıc period, presumably because the Upanisadic speculation developed in a milieu different from that of the Saniutās and the Brālimanas A well known Dharma sutra is ascribed to Vasistha, and, in the Epics and the Puranas, Vasistha is often represented as a major character However, in my talk of this evening I shall restrict myself only to the consi deration of some salient aspects of Vasstha&rsquo;s special contribution to the religious ideology of the Rgvedic period

It is suggested that every regular family-book (Mandala ) of the Rgreda contains what may be called a family hymn, the main purpose of which is to glorify the progenitor of the family and to celebrate some special attainments and characteristic exploits of that family as a whole Such family-hymas usually occur at the end of the group of hymns relating to lodra, for, it is believed that the peculiar distinction achieved by that family is essentially the result of Indra&rsquo;s benign favour The thirty third hymd ja the seventh Mandala of the Rgveda is the family hymn of the Vási sthas who are the authors of that Mandala 4 The Anukramani of Katyāyana characterises this hymn as a samstava, which tertu is explained by the commentator Sadgurusisya as sahastuti In other words, according to Katyāyana, the hyma embodies the mutual laudation by Maitrāvaruni Vasistha, the progenitor of the family, and his descendants The commentator elaborates this by adding that, in the first nine stanzas, Vasistha praises his descendants, while, in the last five, the descendants praise their great ancestor.

fication and supplements, as it were, the narration of that Vāsi stha According to Saunaka&rsquo;s Brhaddevata (V 163 ff ), VII 33 is a samvada sukta or, alternatively, it is merely a hymn in praise of Indra
Actually, however, the thirty third hymn in the seventh Mandala, which incidentally, is relatively late (it may be noted, for instance, that this hymn does not have the usual refrain, Pujam pāta siasuhih sada nal), is a kind of ballad which seeks to glorify Maitrāvaruni Vasistha the progenitor of the family of the Vasisthas Like a ballad, this hymn is made up partly of direct speech, whereby either the bard himself assumes the roles of the different characters and speaks out their speeches (eg of Indra in stapzas 1 and 4 and of Agastya in stanza 14 ) or he rhetorically addresses the person who is being glorified, namely, Maitrāvaruni Vasistha (as in stanzas 10 and 11 ), and partly of Darration in the third person Other characteristics of a ballad, which can be noticed in this hymn, are repetition, ellipsis, ab sence of proper sequence of stanzas, impromptu addition, and parenthesis That the central theme of this hymn is the glorifica tion of Vasistha is skilfully brought out by the poet by means of the deliberate use of the word vasistha, in different numbers and in different cases, in all its stanzas This literary device, which is but rarely employed in the RV, may also be regarded as confirm ing the ballad character of the hymn Further it may be pointed out that, even where the word occurs in plural, it has to be under stood as referring to the progenitor of the family himself, the plural having been used as a token of respect (ādarärihe) The only exception is stanza 4 (indre fusniam adadhata yasisthāh) where the plural vassthāh unequivocally denotes the descendants of Maitruvarunt Vasistha ( who is referred to with the words sah pitrnam) However, even here, the plural pitrnam refers to the great ancestor
This family hymn of the Vasisthas may be conveniently divided into three clear cut sections (a) 1-6 Vasistha personally called upon Indra ( abhi pra manduh) and won him over to the side of the Trtsus and the Bharatas, In this context, it may be

incidentally added that the Taittirija Samhitā (III 5 2 1) and the Gopatha Bralimiana (2 2 13 ) also say that Vasistha was the only seer who had personally seen Indra raja jā indranı pratja Ksam nå &lsquo;pasy ams tam 1asistha ea prat; ak sam apaśyat Through Indra&rsquo;s favour and Vasistha&rsquo;s priestcraft, prayers, and leadership, the Titsu Bharatas became victorious in the Daśarajña, (b) 7 8 Vasistha was a master of mystic knowledge and 10mitable priestly prowess (na &lsquo;nj ena stomo vasistha an elave vah), and (c) 9 14 the two births of Yasistha It will be easily realised that the sequence of these sections should have properly been reverse It will be further realised that the story of Vasistha&rsquo;s double birth is intended to be the core and kernel of this whole hymn For, it is, Verily, the peculiar nature of the birth of Vasistha which distinguishes him essentially from the other Vedic seers More oeyr, while the other two topics, namely, Vasistba&rsquo;s priesteraft and his successful intervention in the Dasarajna have occurred in many other passages in the seventh Mandala a more or less detailed description of his miraculous birth is to be found only in this hymn
One of the most important features of this account of Vasistha s two births from the point of view of religio philosophi cal ideology, is the emphasis put on the cosmic ethical motivation for Vaststha s taking birth in this phenomenal world The bard of RV VII 33 begins by proclaiming that the great Vasistha, on account of the light of his heart (hrdayasya praketaih) or inner vision (cf suryasye &lsquo;ra raksatho jjour esam jo st 8), was
manifold and multifarious phenomenal world was (ta i minyam hrdajasja praketail sahasraialsam abhi sam caranti) It is thereby suggested that Vasistha could not have felt any special curiosity or urge for being born in this world and thus actually experiencing the various vicissitudes of th s worldly life He could have as well kept himself aloof in serene isolation from the vagaries of samsara Jodced, such non entanglement in the affairs of worldly life was tlie goal which was anxiously sought after by many thinkers (particularly by the adherents of the
336
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
Muni-Yatı cult as against those of the Rsi cult) But Vasistha took the initiative in the matter of being born in this world-he, of his own accord, approached the celestial nymph Urvašī with a view, as it becomes clear from the latter part of the hymn, to inducing her to mother him (cf st 9 apsarasa upa sedur vasisthah, st 11 · uta &lsquo;si maiträvaruno vasistho &lsquo;riaśjā brahman manaso &lsquo;dhi jätah, st 12 apsarasah pari jajne vasisthah) And the motivation for this as the poet tells us was that Vasistha felt obligated to weave further the garment which Yama had started weaving (st 9 yamena tatam parıdhim vayantah) According to the Vedic mythology, Yama was the first ancestor of the human race 7 The idea of the procreation of the human race by him is here expressed through the imagery of the stretched out garment It is the bounden duty of every one to see that the Weaving of the garment initiated by Yama continues uninterrup tedly—in other words, to see that the human race does not become extinct from the face of the earth It is a kind of cosmic ethical obligation, which, incidentally, developed, in course of time, into the concept of pitr rna As the Tarttırıya Sam says (VI 3 10 5) Jayamano vai brahmanas tribhur rnava jayale bralımacar yena ribhjo jajñena deiebhyah prajaya pirrbhah
Vasistha thought of taking birth in this world not because he was, in any way, enamoured of the mysteries of samsāra-he already had the inner vision of all the secrets of the world without having had to get physically involved in it He did so because he was acutely conscious of his duty to the human race and did not want to run away from it The cosmic process would be seriously disturbed if the continuity of the human race was, for any reason, disrupted That Vasıstha wished to be born in this world and procreate only in order to be able to fulfil this cosmic ethical purpose seems to be the key note of the entire account of Vasistha&rsquo;s birth, for, this idea is repeated once more in VII

33 12 cd (zamena tatam parıdhm sayısyann apsarasah pari jajne sasisthah) &amp; The cosmic-ethical motivation of Vasistha&rsquo;s first birth at once elevates his character
The first birth of Vasistha, in which Mitra Varuna and Urvaší were involved as divine parents, may be said to possess mainly biological import It is, accordingly, linked up with the cosmic ethical obligation of ensuring the continuity of the human race, which too, is essentially biological in import But, apart from living as an individual and procreating for the sake of the continuity of the human race, man has also to live in the society and do his duty as a responsible member of the society in conformity with his ionate endowments and cultivated faculties It is this socio ethical obligation which underlies what is represent ed as the second birth of Vasistha Incidentally, the later concept of dvija has its roots in this very way of thinking The Manusmrti ( II 147 48 ) uses two significant terms to denote the two kinds of birth, namely, sambhuti and jalı
The second birth of Vasistha, according to this family hymn, consisted in Vasistha&rsquo;s being introduced and recommended by his elder brother-and, therefore, perhaps his Acārya-Agastya to the Titsu Bharatase for appointment to the office of Brahman Purohita &quot; (This one, here) &ldquo;, says Agastya to the Trtsus (st 14), &ldquo;supports the supporter (or the employer) of the Ukthas the Hotr) and the supporter (or the employer) of the Samans (= the Udgatr ), (and he also supports him who ) 15 the supporter or the operator of the Soma crushing stone (= the Adhvaryu ), and (he alone) may speak with authonty in front of all of them Do you receive him entertaining good will (for him) Here would Vasistha come unto you, O Pratrds &quot; (ththabhırtan sānabhrtam bibhartı graanam bibhrar pra jadaty

Vasistha to the Trtsus in such glowing terms is quite understand able, for, Vasistha, though a seer of the RV, has been traditionally recognised as a master of the Atharyanic lore and practices, and, therefore as being best qualified to officiate as Brahman and Purohita The Taittiriya Sam (III 5 2 1) confirms this tradition tato vasisthapurolitah prajah pra Jayanta tasmad vaststho brahma karyah prai &lsquo;ra jayale Eventually Vasistha did adequately fulfil his duty in the socio political sphere by competently playing his role as the Purohita of the Trtsu Bharatas in connection with the Dasarajña 11
The concepts of the cosmic ethical obligation and the socio ethical obligation which are adumbrated in RV VII 33, perhaps for the first time in Indian literature, must, indeed be regarded as a significant feature of Vasistha&rsquo;s contribution to the religio philosophical thought of the Vedic India
It is, indeed difficult to make any definite statement regarding Vasistha&rsquo;s exact role in the Daśarajña for, in the Vedic literature, the Dasarajña has nowhere been described in a consis tent and connected narrative in the Rgveda apart from a few stray allusions in the third and the sixth Mandalas fairly detailed references to it occur in hymns 18, 33, and 83 of the seventh Mandala The Dasarajña is also referred to, directly or indirectly, in the Maitrayanı Samhuta III 37, the Kathaka Samhita 21 10, the Jainimija Brahmana 3 244, the Tandya Brahmana 15 37, the Kausitaki Upanisad 3 ], and the Great Epic I have collated the relevant material from the various versions of the Dāśarajña have tried to eliminate the inconsistencies and deficiencies in them as far as possible and have reconstructed a plausible history mainly with the help of what may be called constructive imagination
There seem to have been two major waves of migration of the Aryans into India The early tribes left the region of Baikh (where their ancestors had lived for a fairly long time) and, after a long and arduous journey in the course of which they had

to encounter various impediments (both natural and human ), eventually reached the land of the Seven Rivers (Sapta Sindhu)
The fertility of the soil, the abundance of water, the regularity of seasons, the bright sun shine — these were among the many ecological factors which prompted them ultimately to settle down in that region In that process, tribal organization came to be gradually transformed into territorial states Five such Aryan states became particularly prominent in the early period of the Aryan settlement in Sapta Sindhu, namely, Puru Anu, Druhyu, Turvaša, and Yadu It was presumably after these five that the early Aryan settlers were collectively called Panca Janāh (Five Peoples) Side by side with these Aryan settlements, there seem to have been in existence also a few non Aryan (indigenous Indian ) settlements as well
The second wave of the Aryan immigrants was more homogeneous in character in that it was constituted of a single major tribe &ndash; the tribe of the Bharatas The leader of the Bharatas, Sudas, was a very ambitious man He aimed at bring ing the early Aryan settlements (collectively called Panca Janah) and the indigenous non Aryan principalities under his control and thereby establish the sovereignty of the Bharatas throughout the Aryandom (Sapta Sindhu) Sudās was as much an intrepid Warrior as a wise statesman He was convinced that, 10 order to achieve his goal, diplomacy and military strategy would both be equally necessary
To the north-west of the early Aryan settlements there was the fauly powerful state of the Tștsus It would seem that the Titsus mic independent of the Panca Janah and had, indeed, OSV Wally been distantly related to the Dhuratas The new comes, Sudas, realised that, with a view to overpowering the Pafica Janīh and the neighbouring non Aryan pracipalities, he wouid have to win over the Titsus to his side Accordingly he devised a shrewd stratagem to establish a political and military alliance with them
In the socio political orgapization of the early Vedic Aryans, flic Purohita played a role which was as important as - if not
340
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
more important than that of the king or the tribal leader It can be seen from the Rgveda that, in the initial stage, the Purohita of the Bharatas was Bharadvaja However, while they were advancing into Sapta Sindhu, Bharadvaja s place was taken by Višvamitra Vasistha was the Purohita of the Tștsus, and was accordingly, the most influential person in the clan of the Titsus Sudās knew that, if he could sway Vasistha in favour of the Bharatas his purpose would be adequately served By a bold stroke of diplomacy, he managed to dispense with the services of Visvamitra and offered to Vasistha the office of the Purohita of the victoriously advancing clan of the Bharatas Vasistha accepted the offer and, as the result of this, an alliance was established between the Bharatas and the Trtsus, with Sudas as their military commandant and Vasistha as their Purohita - the ultimate aim of the alliance having been the Bharata sovereignty in the Aryandom
But Visvamitra was not a man to take such things lying down Enraged at the supercilious treatment meted out to him, he went over to the Panca Janah, woke them up to the danger of the impending invasion by the Bharatas, and eventually manoeuvred them into forming a kind of loose military confederation for the purpose of arresting the Bharata onslaught He thereby also hoped to avenge the indignity which he had been made to suffer It may be presumed that this confederation, which came to be known as the “Ten Kiogs&rdquo; (Daša Rajanah ), consisted of the five states of the early Aryan settlers and some neighbouring non Aryan principalities Obviously, the number ten in this context has to be understood as being only generally descriptive rather than definitive The pames of some of the leaders and member tribes of the confederation - Aryan (Puru, Turvaša, Druhyus, Anava, etc) and non Aryan (Paktbas, Bhalapases, Visanins Sivas Simyu, etc )- are actually mentioned in the Rgvedic hymns relating to this subject
The two sides arrayed themselves against each other - the Bharatas and the Trtsus led by Sudas and Vasistha on the one side and the &ldquo;Ten Kings &ldquo;, assisted by Viśvamitra, among others,

as their Purohita, on the other - for the eventful war which has been described in the Veda as the Dasarājna or the War of the Ten Kings (Incidentally, the word dasarājña itself occurs only three times in the Rgreda ) The war consisted of many battles and skirmishes (though there is no evidence to suggest that it extended over several generations, but the decisive battle seems to have been fought on the bank of the river Parusni. Under the benign patronage of lodra (VII 33 5 rasisthasya stinata indro aśrol) and with the help of Vasistha&rsquo;s efficacious priestcraft (VII 83 4 ; safyā irisinām ablavat purohitin), Sudás won the final victory and thus succeeded in establishing the sovereignty of the Bharatas in the region of Sapta-Sindhu (VII. 33 6. ad if trtsūnām viso apraihanta)
So far as the evolution of the Rgvedic religion and mythology is concerned, two aspects of Vasistha&rsquo;s contribution to it become specially conspicuous (1) the essential elements of the classical doctrine of Bhakti are more or less clearly anticipated in the hymns of the seventh Mandala of the Rgreda, particularly in those relating to Varuna (VII 86 89),&rdquo; and (2) Vasistha seems to have made special efforts to bring about a kind of religious conciliation between the ancient Varuna cult and the new Indra-cult 18
The theory that the doctrine of Bhakti was originally borrowed from some non-Indian sources has now become obsolete and is hardly given any credence On the contrary, it can be clearly demonstrated that perhaps the earliest Indian literary evidence of Bhakti is provided by the Varuna-hymos in the seventh Mandala of the Rgreda The peculiar relationship between Varuna and Vasistha, as envisaged in those hymos, Icflects most of the essential characteristics of the classical doctrine of Bhaktı- though by no means in any systematic form or order Onc of the basic features of Bhakti is that the Bhakta

or devotee, on the one hand, realises the almost insuperable distance between the supreme majesty of God and his own lowly station, and yet, on the other hand, anxiously longs for an intimate personal communion with Him This feature of Bhaktı may be said to have been very well brought out in the two jpitial stanzas of RV VII 86 On the face of it, the first stanza of that hymn, which speaks of the cosmic greatness and functions of Varuna (dhira tv asya maluna janamsi vi yas tastanibha rodası cid urvi / pra nakain rsvam nunude brhantam dyita naksatram paprathac ca bhuma), appears to be rather incompatible with the general tenor of the hymn as a whole Again the word tu in the very first pada of the first stanza is not quite apropos, for, as it is, its adversative sense does not become clear The same may be said of the word uta zz the first pada of the second stanza (wta Fiajo tanya sam vade tat), for, apparently it does not help to establish any logical connection between the first stanza and the second stanza It is, however, possible to suggest a cogent interpretation of these two stanzas The first stapza may be regarded as presupposing the thought which had ever been uppermost in the mind of Vasistha as a Bhakta, namely, that he should be vouchsafed the privilege of a personal communion with his special God Varuna A constant and caracst longing such as this is, indeed, the starting point of Bhaktı But (tu) Vasistha at once became conscious of the wide gulf which separated him from Varuna &lsquo;through whose cosmic majesty (mahina ), the creatures (janumsı) become stabilised, who props asunder the two worlds, even though they are enormous (VII 86 1 ab) And yet (uta) Vasistha persisted in his longing for being within the innermost presence of Varuna&rsquo; (kada ny antar varune bhuranı) This kind of mental struggle in which the emotional urge for participation&rsquo; in the divinity ultimately gets the better of the intellectual doubt arising out of the sense of distance&rsquo;, may be said to constitute the very preparatory stage of Bhakti
Another factor which tends to dissuade a Bhakta from his efforts to share the divine presence is his feeling of moral ineligi bility In RV VII 86, we find Vasıştha harping upon bus enas

(3a proche tad enah), āgas (4a, him aga āsa saruna), drugdha (5ab . ava drughant srja nah) But bis inger urge for a close communion with God was so strong that, even like a Bhakta of the classical tracts, Yasistha earnestly tried to get over this moral impediment (VII 86 6) For one thing, he insisted that whatever sins he might be deemed to have committed were by no means deliberate (acittih) - they did not spriog from his Owo free will na sa s10 daksah) It was, verily, destiny (dhruth and passion (manyuh) and evil influence (asti jjāyān kaniyasa upare), among others, which had led him astray He might have transgressed the laws of Varuna unknowingly (acuni yat tag dharmā yuz opinia VII 89 5c) or on account of the poverty of will power (krarvah dinata VII 89 3a) but Varuna should not punish him for that sin (ma nas tasmad enaso dela ririsah VII 89 5d) Vasistha further claimed that the greatest atonement for his sins was that he had sincerely repented for what he had donc The drstanta of pasutrp tayu (VII 86 5c ara rajan pastrpam na tayımı sija) is clearly suggestive of this Just as a thief, who had stolen cattle but who eventually confessed his crime and expressed repentance, was released, so too did Vasistha, who had sinned but later repented for his sins, expect to be released Morcover, Vasistha now wanted to surrender himself completely to Varuoa&rsquo;s mercy, expurgating himself of all traces of sia or moral guilt (ava tla &lsquo;ncna namasā tura ijam: VII 86 4d, aram daso na mlhuse harany alanı devaja bhūrnaje
improvement on the part of a Bhakta helps to neutralize the seriousness of his moral compunction But, above all, it was Vasistha&rsquo;s unswerving faith in Varuna&rsquo;s compassion which reassured him against the fear of being rejected by Varuna He knew that Varuna showed mercy even to a perpetrator of sins (yo mrlayalı calruşe cid ägok VII 87 7a) and that, thereforc, Varuna would pot make him suffer for his sios ( ma la enosvanto jaksin bhujema VII 88 6c)
Perhaps the most essential feature of Bhaktı is the close personal relationship which the Bhakta clums with God This344
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
relationship was expressed by Vasistha in various ways He called himself a friend ( sakhā VII 86 4b) of Varuna — verily, a friend even though he might have signed against Varuna (Ivanı agamsı kravat sahhā te VII 88 66 ) He was Varuna&rsquo;s constant kiosman, ever dear to him (apır mitjah varuna priyah san. VII 88 6a) He would serve Varuna as a slave (aram daso na milhuse karāni VII 86 7a) The drstanta in VII 86 5d (ava srpā vatsam na damno vasisthanı), would, indeed, suggest that Vasistha was like a tethered calf ever longing to be united with the mother cow
Classical accounts of the relation between the Bhakta and God often speak of occasional estrangement between the two Indeed, such estrangement heightens the personal flavour of the relationship Vasistha also is seen to be lamenting the fading away of the well known friendship between Varuna and himself the friendship in which they were bound together without any guile (kva tJāni nau sakhi a babhūvuh sacāvahe yad avrkam purā cit VII 88 Sab) A similar misunderstanding, which was differently motivated, seems to have formed the background of the dialogue between Varuna and Atharvan in AV V 11 (the only samyada sukla in the AV-Atharvan in this context having been none other than Vasistha himself 14
The classical doctrine of Bhaktı normally requires that God in whose divine entity the Bhakta seeks to participate 18 a personal God There are indications in the Varuna hymns in the seventh Mandala that the pure and most agrecable prayer wbich Vasistha proffered unto Varuna turned the worshipful Varuna towards him (RV VII 88 1abc la im aryancam karate yajatram), that Vasıştha thus caught direct sight of Varuna (adha w esy&amp; sandslam yagaman VII 88 2a ), and that Vasistka could thereafter conveniently visualise and meditate upon Varuna

through the medium of Agni (agner anikum varunassa mams: VII 88 26 ) who was always easily visible Actually Yasistha seems to have been a frequent visitor to Varuna&rsquo;s huge thousand doored mansion (brhatam mianam varuna svadhavah sahasradvaran jagama grham te VII 88 Scd )
The mystic experiences which Vasistha was privileged to enjoy in Varuna&rsquo;s company copstitute further evidence for the doctrine of Bhaktı having been, to some extent, forestalled in Vasistha&rsquo;s hymns to Varuna For instance, Vasastha spoke, with a touch of nostalgia, of the time when they two – Varuna and he himself — climbed into the boat, steered forth to the midst of the ocean were tossed up and down upon the back of the waters, and thus swung on a swing, as it were, for glory (VII 883 i jad ruhava sarunaś ca noiam pra yat samulram trajava madhyam / adhi yad apam snubhis carava pra prenk ha inhhayāvahai śubhe ham ) 16 On another occasion, Varuna is said to have prescated before Vasistha the cosmic mystery of light and darkness (VII 88 2cd Svar jad aśmann ad pa i ondho &lsquo;bhi mă vapur drsaye nınıyal) Tadeed, Varuna conceded special grace to Vasistha in that he initiated the seer into the secret of the threefold seven names of the &ldquo;cow&rsquo; (uvaca ine varuno medhuraja trh sapia nama &lsquo;ghnya biblarit VII 87 4ab) or that he bestowed upon Atharvaa the gift of Pęśni, that is, the magically potent vak (AV V 11 lc prstim Taruna dak sınām dadaian) As a matter of fact, Vasistha owed his very Rsi hood to Varuna&rsquo;s grace (rsim cakära svapā maloblah VII 88 4b) These references to Varuna&rsquo;s special grace to Vasişgha, verily, clinch the arguments in favour of the above hypothesis regarding the doctrine of Bhakti

strator of that cosmic lau It was thus concept of the cosmic law and its administrator which was further developed and conso lidated into the concept of Rta-Varuna among the tribes of the Proto-Aryans which migrated to Saptasındhu (Proto-Indo-Aryans) and into the concept of Asa Ahura among thc tribes of the Proto Aryans which migrated to Iran (Proto Irano Aryans) 17 The Cours of the migration of the Proto-Indo-Aryans to Saptasındhu (unlike that of the Proto-Irano Aryans to Iran), it would further appcar, was beset with many impediments (vrfrani) — both cnvironmental and human Naturally cnough, there occurred a change of a very sundimental character in their way of life and thought, and, correspondingly, also in their religious ideology A cosmic god llc Asura Varuna could no longer fully satisfy their rcligious cravings They now wanted a heroic god who would successfully sponsor their onward march to Saptasındhu Thcy, accordingly, cvolved the mythological concept of Vftrahan Indra Thcrc, thus, dcycloped in Vedic rcligion two major cults- presumably rivalling cach other namely, the morcancicot cult centering round Asura Varuna and the newly crolved one centering round Vrtralian Indra 11 A headlong conflict between these two cults could hasc adversely affected the solidarity of the Vedic community What has been said above about the peculiar Iclationship between Varuna and Vasistha would show that Vasistha was a devoted protagonist of the Varuna-cut But, in View of thic impending schism within the Vedic Anaodom, he, transcending all thought of bigotry, assumed a very practical and realistic attitude and deliberately sought to co-ordinate and harmonize the two religious cuits A critical study of the hymns in the seventh Mandala, which relate to the dual divinity Indra Varuna, would more than confirm this hypothesis

There are, in the Rgveda, eight whole hymns and parts of two hymos, which havc Indrāvarunau as devata 18 But all of them, barning the four hymns in the seventh Mandala, which, incidentally form the largest single group of Indra Varuna hymns in any Mandala, are quite conventional in character in RV VII 82-85, on the other hand a specific relationship is sought to be established between the two gods Indra and Varana It is emphasised in various passages in these hymos26 that the spheres of activity of Varuna and Indra though separate are essentially complementary and that an active collaboration, on equal terms, of these two gods alone ensures the properly integrated and amicable operation of the world process in its cosmic and socio political aspects All thought of antagonism between Varuna and Indra is studiously discountenanced and an attitude of religious conciliation clearly indicated 21
This, Vasistha accomplished in various ways For instancc, he identisied the specific spheres of sovereignty of these two gods by characterising one of them as samraj and the other as siaraj (suinral anjah siaral anya ucyare van VII 82 2a) As has been pointed out earlier, Varuna was from the very beginning, conceived of as samraj or world sovereign since he was con sidered to have been responsible for the proper functioning of cosmic law, Ria Indra on the other hand, was originally a human hcro who led the Vedic Aryans in their exploits of conquest and colonisation and was only at a later stage when history came to be mythologiscd transformed into the national war god of the Vedic mythology The description of Indra as Jo jala ela prailaniah ( 11 12 1) would seem to suggest (1) that Indra was introduced as a god into the Vedic pantheon at a later stage in the evolution of the Vedic mythology (ata) and (2) that,

at the very moment when he was so introduced, he assumed the foremost position among the Vedic gods (prathamah) Indra was svaraj &ndash; which epithet I am tempted to explain as denoting one who had won his luminous divine sovereignty (raj) through his own (sva) prowess Once one comprehended these two aspects of the Vedic mythology — the cosmic-ethical aspect (as represented by Varuna) and the human heroic aspect (as represented by Indra) — jo the proper historical perspective, one would forthwith disabuse one&rsquo;s mind of any thought of any essential antagonism between the two gods Both gods were great (malantau VII 82 2b) in their respective roles Having duly recognised this, all other gods, in the highest heaven, subserved indra Varyna by consigning into them their splendour and their strength (VII 82 2cd vißve devasah parame vyomani sam vam ojo yrsana sam balam dadhul)
A natural development in the Vedic religious ideology was that Varuna, the god of cosmic law, also came to be represented specifically as the god who enforced moral order within the human community Indra, the war god, sponsored the Vedic Aryans&rsquo; exploits of conquest and colonization, while Varuna, the moral governor, blessed their efforts in connection with law and order În bis Indra-Varuna hymns, Vasistha took every opportunity of deliberately emphasizing the point that the two gods were respectively associated with the two essentially complementary functions, namcly, conquest and establishment of law and order which must necessarily follow each conquest Vasistha did this in a variety of ways In one passage (VII 82 4ab), for instance, he spoke of Indra being invoked in battles and wars (jum yutsu prianasu havamahe) and of Varuna * being invoked in connection with the promotion of the activities of peace (Juvām ksemasya prasave havamahe) Here the word yuām is obviously to be understood in the sense of yuvayoh anjam But, with a view to eliminating even a remote possibility of a dichotomy between the two gods being implied through such hard and fast allocation of functions, Vasistha seems to have deliberately used the dual form jurām The dual form would

properly integrated socio political life for the Vedic Aryans The Vedic Aryans were, therefore required to offer prayers to both Varuna and Indra The prayer to Varuna, who held the commu. nity together by assigning suitable functions to its various constituents (VII 85 3c krstır anyo dhārayati praviktā) and who resented all assaults against Rta (VII 84 4c pra ya adityo anrta minatı) was that there should be no occurrence of any transgression of Varuna s law-cosmic ethical and human moral - which would entail that god s ill will and displeasure (VII 84 2c pari no helo varunasya vrjyah) and that to Indra who destroyed irresistible foes (VII 85 3d vrfranj anyo apratini hantı) and bestowed on his worshippers couptless treasures (VII 84 4d amita sūro dajate vasuni ), that he should make available ample facility for settlement and expansion (VII 84 2d urum na indrah krnavad u lokam) Such deliberate and meaningful juxtaposition of the two gods by Vasistha would amply testify to his conscious commitment to the self imposed mission of avoiding a rift within the Vedic religion by bringing about a rapprochement between the Varuna-cult and the Indra cuit

<p>APPENDIX<br>
INDO EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY - SOME NOTES</p>
<p>(1) Comparative mythology is a natural extension of com parative linguistics A comparative study of the various laoguages of the wide region extending from Ireland in the west to India jo the east led to the assumption first of a common Indo-European (IE) language as the ancient ancestor of all those languages, and subsequently of a common IE people, who spoke that language, and of a common IE culture, particularly of common IE scugion and mythology Understandably enough, the study of Vedic language and Vedic religion and mythology served almost as the starting point of the two disciplines of comparative lingule stics and comparative mythology However, in the early years of the history of Vedic philology in the West, scholars like BOPP, BOHLEN, and BENFEY are seen to have evinced greater interest in the language of the Veda than in the religion and my thology of the Veda, though we do come across such stray speculations relating to comparative mythology as that Sāra meyau in the Rgieda are identical with Greek Kerberos, that Dionysos is to be understood as the joint divinity of dyu (day) and miś (night) (both these suggestions by BENFEY), and that the legend of the Panis and the cows is comparable to the myth of Cacus ard Evander (suggested by F ROSEN) Exen ROTH, who may be said to have inaugurated the era of critical Vedic scholarship with his worth 2x Litteratus wd Geschichte des Weda (1846), did not occupy lumself to any appreciable extent
1 Thesc notes were prepared for a paper which I was invited to present at the Indo Soviet Symposium on &quot; Ethnic problems of the early bistory of the peoples of Central Asia and lacia in the second millennium BC, held at Dushanbe, USSR, on October 17 22, 1977 It was intended that these potes would be developed into a full rescarch paper after the reaction to them of the participants in the Symposuim had become known Unfortunately, however, for personal reasons, I could not attend the Symposium at Dushanbe

with comparative mythology as such It is Adalbert KUHN who must be regarded as the true pioneer of comparative mythology with special reference to the Veda KUHN believed that, just as the JE peoples derived their respective languages from a common IE language, they also derived most of their mythological concepts from a common IE mythology He further believed that the etymologies of the names of the various Vedic gods provided ample material for identifying the IE elements in Vedic mythology In other words comparative linguistics and comparative mytho logy went hand in hand And, thirdly, he believed that most of the Vedic (and, therefore, IE) gods were personifications of natural powers and phenomena MAX MULLER also was an ardent exponent of this very kind of comparative mythology and based his theories about Vedic mythology on the three assumptions set forth by KUHN For instance, MAX MULLER accepted the equations Sārameyau = Hermeias, Saramā = Helena, Saranyu = Erionys, Parjanya=Perkunas (Lith), Usas=Eos, Bhaga=Bogu (old Slav ), Väta = Wotan, Vak = Vox, etc In bis Gifford Lectures on Anthropologica) Religion delivered at the University of Glasgow in 1891, MAX MULLER uttered these momentous words &ldquo;If I were asked what I consider the most important dis covery which has been made during the nineteenth century with respect to the ancient history of mankind, I should say it was the simple etymological equation Sanskrit Dyaus-Pitar = Greek Zeus Pater = Latin Jupiter = Old Norse Tyr&rdquo; One can hardly think of a more eloquent simultaneous glorification of the two disciplines of comparative linguistics and comparative mytho logy
The nineteenth century witnessed the rise of several academic disciplines (including archaeology ), but the major contribution of that century must, indeed, be regarded as having been the con cept of an IE language family (Incidentally, it was Thomas YOUNG who, in 1813, introduced the term &ldquo;IE: while reviewing Johano ADELUNG&rsquo;s work Mithridates ) The view has, no doubt, been expressed from time to time, by linguisticians like TRUBETZKOY, SOLTA, PISANI, and ALLEN, that the assumption
INDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY
353
of a single unitary Ur IE is by no means necessary for explaining the IE language family But, as THIEME has rightly pointed out, the IE languages have too many similarities to be explained by anything other than a common genetic origin
Language is regarded as the most potent source for the study of a culture Language, according to KEARY, “holds within it far better than do tumuli or weapons, or articles of pottery or woven stuffs or ornaments, the records of long past times” CHILDE confirms this by stating that “language, albeit an abs traction, is yet a more subtle and pervasive criterion of indivi duality than the culture-group formed by comparing flints and potsherds of the &lsquo;races&rsquo; of skull measures &quot;
This view clearly smacks of a partiality for the study of language as against archaeology The obvious limitations of linguistics must not be lost sight of
(2) A kind of reaction against the approach to Vedic mythology exclusively from the point of view of comparative mythology was but to be expected John MUIR, for instance, in the fifth volume of his Original Sanskrit Texts (1872), seemed to insist on Vedic religion and mythology being studied primarily from the Vedic sources, the comparative methods being utilised, if at all, only secondarily Abel BERGAIGNE also was generally averse to the methods of comparative mythology which had been so much overworked by KUHN and MAX MULLER The my thology of the Vedic Aryans was, according to him, closely con nected with their peculiar sacrificial cult which showed hardly any TE influence HILLEBRANDT also firmly believed that Vedic mythology and Vedic ritual were essentially inseparable He fur ther insisted that etymology, even if correct (and one could not be too sure of its correctness&rsquo;), was mythologically useless be cause the meaning which it furnished was so general that it rarely gave any sure clue to the character of a Vcdic god Similarly, though OLDENBERG had no objection to individual Vedic gods being traced back to tbeir IE forms, he rightly cautioned that in that connection one must free opeself from the realm of mere

etymology According to OLDENBERG, Vedic religion must be viewed essentially and primarily as an Indian religion and not as a mere modification of IE religion He also emphasised the anthropological and ethnological factors in the development of
Vedic religion and mythology
(3) Though MACDONELL, BLOOMFIELD, and VON SCHR OEDER sought to revive the methods of comparative mythology in the study of Vedic religion and mythology, it came to be strongly reasserted (for instance, by PISCHEL and GELDNER ) that the Rgveda was predominantly an Indian document, that comparative linguistics was not necessarily a safe guide, and that the gulf between the earliest culture of the IE peoples of Europe and that of the Vedic age was such that no amount of phonetic equations could bridge it The unwarranted emphasis on the JE elements ia Vedic religion and mythology and the method of mere etymologising had consequently to be given up There also be came evident a growing tendency against the naturalistic inter pretation of Vedic mythology Among other tendencies which became prominent besides anti naturalism may be mentioned the awareness of the prevalence in Vedic religion of what might be called the ideology of primitive magic and the recognition of the non Aryan (non IE) elements 10 Vedic mythologyINDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY

(4) Such was the state of things when, nearly forty years ago, the discipline of comparative IE mythology was revived, but on different lines It has been pointed out that, instead of carry ing out minute historical research on the detailed development of the individual deities by forging links on the basis of sheer ety mological speculations and thereby patching up a ragged image composed of aimless bits of evidence, the new trends focussed attention on pattern and structure In other words, mythology was now studied in a structuralist way rather than in an &lsquo;ato mistic&rsquo; way The emphasis had shifted from lexical analogues 10 structural similarities The following principal approaches may be mentioned as representing these new trends in comparative IE mythology

(d) Soviet scholars have emphasized the definite proximity between Indo Iranian ( specially Iranian) and Slavonic vocabu. tary for social and rcligious concepts TOPOROV has, for instance, drawn attention to what he calls Slavonic reminiscences of the Mithraic terminology and to the demon adversaries of Indra and their correspondences in a Russian folk-tale (Vyamsa Usnya ) TOPOROV and IVANOV have analysed the Indra-and the Parjanya. hymns in the Rgredu with a view to the reconstruction of the IE mythologeme of the storm god and his adversary They have pointed to the correspondeacc between Vedic Vetra-Vala and the Slavonic god Velcs (Incidentally, R JACOBSON believes that Veles is clearly related to Varuna both linguistically and mytho. logically ) ELIZARENKOVA and TOPOROV have attempted a semiotic interpretation of Indra&rsquo;s prominence in the Rgvedic pan theon and of its prc history TOPOROY has investigated the gods as they arc enumerated in The Russian Priniary Chronicle, in the Igor Talc, and in various other works with special reference to the ancient Slavonic pantheon (and not to culiemerization) and his

VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
postulated the equations Stribogủ = Varuna Mitra, Perunnŭ = Indra, and Volosů = Asvinau He and ELIZARENKOVA have brought out the typological similarity of Usas to one concrete personage of the Baltic ( Lettish) folklore Damely, Usins (male) Usas is looked upon as not merely a poetic symbol of dawn but as a functional symbol having its roots in the mythology common to the Indo Iranians and the Balts Mention is also made in this connection of the cow symbolism which was so common among both these peoples
A reference may further be made here to some other views of Soviet scholars relating to comparative JE mythology In connection with the cow symbolism, attention is drawn to the related concepts Lithuanian daina Avestan daēna, and Vedic dhena (dhenu, dhı) suggesting the close association of ritual aad liturgy with the cow symbolism so characteristic of Usas Inciden tally, the cow symbolism is said to have been fairly prominent in Slavonic marriage etc A typological study of Vedic Usas and Lettish Usins is said to prove that two comparable and isomorph figures appear in Vedic mythology and Lettish folklore ELIZA RENKOVA suggests that Agpi and Aśvins represent incomplete correspondences of Usins viewed as a solar figure TOPOROV and IVANOV speak of Byelorussian reflexion of a group of IE words connected with the storm god cult They point to Byelorussian linguistic and mythological parallel to Vedic Parjanya Studying the correlation between Indra and Varuna ELIZARENKOVA puts forth the hypothesis concerning the pre RV state, when the level of magic power represented by Mitra Varuna must have modelled all the three functions of gods (cf DUMEZIL) IVANOV draws attention to the ancient Indian myth of primeval names giving and its parallel in the Greek tradition, while TOPOROV tries to reconstruct the world egg&rsquo; myth
(e) The discipline of comparative mythology has, in recent years, again come into its own, thanks mainly to the prolific efforts of Georges DUMÉZIL It is claimed that this new compa rative IE mythology seeks to unravel and define the conceptual structures common to the religious and social organization of the
INDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY
357
early historical and pre literate IE-speaking people It is further claimed that the sociological approach, initiated by DUMÉZIL and zealously sponsored by WIKANDER, DE VRIES, and PUIIVEL, not only draws on the philological speculations of the past 150 years, but also incorporates the structuralist mode of thought of this century in such fields as linguistics, anthropology, folklore, and history of religion in a sense, DUMÉZIL&rsquo;S methods are said to reflect the fusion of comparativist and sociological traditions
DUMÉZIL starts from the Durkhelmian functional relation ship between social and sacred phenomena and arrives at his conception of tripartite division of IE social organization into priests, warriors, and food producers (that is, peasantry and arti sans) as the keystont of a common ideology wbich was a wide spread and unique trait in ancient Rome, Iran and India and which recurred also among the early Germans and Celts The conception of a social structure based on the distinction and hierarchisation of three functions gave rise to the threefold mythology in this trifupctional mythological pattern, DUMÉZIL speaks of (1) the top level of joint sovereigoty&rsquo;, the magico-religious aspect of which is represented by Vedic Varuna, Roman Jupiter, and Germa nic Odia and the juridical aspect of which is represented by Vedic Mitra, Roman Dius Fidius, and Germanic Tyr, (11) the second level of &lsquo;warrior&rsquo;, which is represented by Vedic Indra ( Vedic Indra, it is sometimes suggested, represents the chivalrous aspect of this level and Rudra the fronzıcd aspect ), Roman Mars, and Germanic Thor, and (111) the third level of&rsquo; fertility, wealth, nourishment, reproduction, etc ' represented by Vedic Asvipau, Roman Qurious, and Germanic Freyja, Frey, Njord, etc DUMÉZIL further extends his scheme to Celtic and Scandioavian mythology and folklore He also speaks of other aspects of triplicity such as 10 justice, war, and famine
Among DUMÉZIL&rsquo;s other mythological equations within this framework are Apām napat=Old Irish god Nechtan, Usas= Roman Mater Matula, Roman Angerona=Vcdic goddess of short days (RV V 40 5-8), Aditi=Fortuna Primigenia, Lua Mater=divine cliaracter of Nirti, Aryaman=Heros Eremon of
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
the Irish folk tales, Visnu=Scandinavian Vidarr Incidentally, DUMÉZIL establishes the relationship between language and cul ture as a genctic rather than a generic model
(f) Some other recent studies in comparative JE mythology have brought out the following points (1) Various springtime festivals among the IC pcopics arc shown to be similar (MANN) (12) Satires in Greek, Celtic Germanic, and Vedic poetry indi cate that the IE social behaviour was motivated more by a sense of public reputation than by the concept of private guilt ( WARD ) (111) The Indo Europeins envisioned the sky as a vault of stone, cf Sk ašman, sky and stone, Avestan asman, Lithuanian akmuo, Slavic kamien, Gothic hininis (But did the IE folk kaow stone vaults?) (iv) Water played a significant role in the burial rites of the IEs of the metal ages (v) The IE notion of society encom passed men as well as animals (Cf wro-peku, durpada-catuspada, also gotra) (yi) The Hittite word pankus would suggest that Vedic pañca ( as for instance, in pañca janah) had the sense of &ldquo;totality (vi) Hellenic Hermes and Vedic Pusan represent a transposition into mythology and religion of the exchange and reciprocity (But it is Paon who is usually identified with Pusan ) (yil! ) RV (X 39 3), Videvdat (7 44), and Pındartc ode ( 5th cent BC) seem to suggest that among the lEs there must have existed three classes of medical specialists (correspondiog to the three social classes ) namely, those who cured by means of spells (for priestly class) those who cured by means of knives (for warrior class) and those who cured by means of herbs (for farmers, etc ) On account of the peculiar agglomerating&rdquo; tendency of the Veda, these three categories of medical specialists are united in the figure of Asvipau (1x) The peculiarly close relationship bet ween the Vedic and the Baltic ideologies is due to the conservatism and archaic character of the latter in respect of language and way of life (x) The Vedic samlada suhtas, the Brahmana legends, and the post Vedic epic motifs have clear counterparts in Irish sagas
(5) Out of the various new approaches in comparative IE
INDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY
359
one which is perhaps most aggressive a a veritable independent tradition in comparative mythology, may be subjected to a brief critical examination It has been rightly pointed out that cultural reconstruclion, and proto ethno science in particular, must take account of the up-to date information from the relevant humanistic and natural sciences DUMÉZIL&rsquo;S work based on Durkheimian theory, which latter, incidentally, is out of date, is said to represent a Degative example It has been further pointed out that much of DUMEZIL&rsquo;s theoretical superstructure depends overly on highly abstract conceptions Again, DUMÉZIL&rsquo;S assection that the tripartite social division did not originally exist among the peoples of antiquity who were not IE is difficult to accept Can “tripartition” be proved to be uniquely IE? Can it not be regarded as having been universally dictated by nature of things? According to BROUGH, for instance, ancient Jewish history provides us with not one but two distinct series of persons and events which are illuminated by a similar tripartite analysis
There is also a wide spread tendency in popular literature towards a threefold characterization The &lsquo;three functions can thus by no means be said to be typically IE It cannot be even proved with certainty that this social stratification was common to all IE peoples While Indo-Ir evidence points to three rigidly defined classes, Roman evidence indicates only three general modes of activity (The contention that, though tripartition is an obvious division of responsiblities within a community, its formal secog Dion is specifically IE is hardly valid Similarly, had tripartition been the core of the IE society and pantheon, the lexical charac
ter of the terms relating to it would have been preserved
And even if it is granted that the IE social organization was composed of “three functions &ldquo;, does it necessarily follow that the gods of the RV (among others) were “collective representa tions” of this social structure? Society cannot be the &lsquo;stuff&rsquo; of the supernatural The way of life may define the character of religion and mythology.
The hierarchical order of the three functions has varied in DUMÉZIL&rsquo;s various explanations The same god is assigued
360
VEDIC MYTHOLOGICAL TRACTS
different functions or more than one function (cf Zeus, Mithra ) in different contexts There is no unanimity of views among the Dumezilians in the matter of assigaing fupctions to dividities is the mutability of DUMÉZIL&rsquo;s own views not indicative of the instability of his position?
But the most glacing defect of DUMÉZIL&rsquo;s theory is that his conception of functional tripartition is not supported by Vedic evidence For instance, lodra, as portrayed in Vedic mythology, has no real counterpart in any other IE mythology or language When DUMEZIL speaks of Mitra as the sovereign in bis clear, regal, calm, benevolent, sacerdotal aspect, and of Varuna as the sovereign 10 his assailant, sombre, inspiring, violent, terrible, war like aspect, one fails to understand on wbat textual evidence he has based his theory of such marked contrast between the two gods One would search in vain for Rgvedic passages in support of the long array of adjectives which the French mythologist has used Similar is the case in regard to DUMEZIL&rsquo;s contention that horse is heavily connected with the Varuna half of sovereignty but absent from the Mitra half While suggesting the corres pondence between Scandinavian Vidart and Vedic Visnu, DUMÉZIL seems to connect the word vsnu woh the preposition vi (denoting the idea of separation), when, in fact, that word has to be derived from the root vi (=to fly) indicating the original bird form of Visnu DUMÉZIL refers to the Roman ritual but does not take into account the Vedic ritual which, incidentally, has developed independently of the IE 1ofuence Indeed, while explicating the character of a Vedic deity, he does not consider the entire Vedic material concerning that deity but selects only what suits his theory.
As for some other points made by DUMÉZIL, it may be point ed out that the Vedic evidence does not support the assumption that Bhaga and Aryaman are minor sovereigns under Mitra, and Daksa and Amsa under Varuna There is also no clear reference in the Mahabharata to the three sins of Indra ( which are made to correspond with those of Tullus Hostilius, the third king of Rome, qud the Norse hero Starkadr) having been responsible for the
INDO EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY
361
birth of Yudhisthira (through the teas which Indra had lost on account of his first sin), of Bhima and Arjuna (through the lost vigorous manhood), and of Nakula and Sahadeva (through the lost beauty )
The fact that ancient Greek mythology reflects but few IE traits would seem scriously to vitiate DUMÉZIL&rsquo;s theory For, as has been pointed out, despite the relative abundance of documen tary evidence as to the character of Grcek religion and mythology, it has proved all but impossible to sort out from it any overall structure comparable to the one which DUMEZIL claims to have discovered in Indo-Irapian, Italic, Norse, and Celtic traditions Ons really wonders as to what extent one can at all impute to the profoundly localized Greek and Indian traditions the IE mytholo gical inheritances And, out of the three factors, namely, diffu sion, independent invention, and common IE heritage, why are the first two altogether ignored ?
Further, there is hardly any element of “religiosity” in the tripartite functional mythology One may also ask whether the religio mythological pattern of a people would remain unchanged in spite of that people s essentially changing environments DUMÉZIL seems to regard mythology as being static It is, in deed, difficult to believe that any mythological pattern could survive the various inevitable changes in social life DUMEZIL derives evidence indiscriminately from myth, ritual, epic, legend, folklore, history, etc How far is it proper to explain obviously historie cal events 10 terms of tripartition (as DUMEZIL sometimes does )? Further, DUMÉZIL often establishes correspondences on slender basis eg legend of Mudgala and Roman rules of divinanon, Visnu and the Iranian entity Rašpu, Maruts and Zoroastrian Fravašis, Roman Fordicidia (involving the sacrifice of a pregnant cow) and the sacrifice of astapadi in the Raja suya, circular temple in Rome and the circular manner in which Vedic sacrificial fires are set up DUMÉZIL&rsquo;s methods are often procrustian and the correspondences postulated by him quite tenuous

(6) Conclusion (1) Comparative linguistics (particularly etymologies of the names of the Vedic gods or mere phonetic cor respondences) should not be made the starting point of any study of Vedic religion and mythology Linguistics may be employed by way of corroborative evidence (or as negative evidence, for in stance, in order to show that the words varuna and ouranos are not derived from the same root) (11) Comparative mytholog too has but limited scope Indeed, Vedic mythology is mucl farther removed from IE mythology than Vedic language from I! language (111) One must guard against mistaking universal concepts for IE concepts (1) Exclusively naturalistic inter pretation of Vedic mythology is not warranted by Vedic evidence (y) The Dumezılıan pattern of functional tripartition provide too narrow a frame to contain all the variety and complexity o Vedic mythology (vi) The importance of anthropological and ethnological factors in the formation and development of mytho logy should not be underestimated (vii) Vedic mythology 1 by no means a static phenomenon It is essentially an evolutiona ry or growing mythology Its character is determined by th Vicissitudes in the life of the Vedic Aryaas (Vit) The IE ele ments in Vedic mythology as it emerges from the Vedic texts ar few, feeble, and faint Compared to the mythologies of som other IE peoples, the development of some of these element appears to have been arrested in Vedic mythology (as in the cas of Dyaus), while the nature of some others has undergone conspicuous change on account of the peculiar influences to whic they had been exposed (as in the case of Asvinau)
The concept of Dyaus may be regarded as having been trul IE in origin Known differently in the mythologies of differer IE peoples as Zeus, Deipatyros, Ziu, Diespater, Jupiter, Tyr, etc this god was originally associated with heavenly and diviae light As such he was also linked with the idea of authority in coafor mity with the patriarchal IE society, he was called “father However, Dyaus was not elevated to the exalted position of th supreme god like his other counterparts The reason for thi seems to have been this. Dyaus represents one aspect of what maINDO-EUROPEANISM AND VEDIC MYTHOLOGY
363
be called cosmic religion. Among the proto-Aryans, there evoly ed another aspect of cosmic religion, Damely, that related to Rta and Varuna, which may be characterised as being peculiar to them and which may be presumed to have arrested the mythological development of Dyaus,
The IEs had no Mother-Goddess as such who stood above the other divinities, though it is suggested that the fact that the words for earth in IE languages are usually feminine (Sk, prilivi, Gk. se, chion, Latin terra) may be indicating the idea of Mother Earth.
Ağvinau provide perhaps the most striking justification for comparative IE mythology. The Divine Twins of the Vedic, Greek, and Baltic traditions (respectively, Ašvinau-Divo Napātā, Dios Kouroi, and Dieva Dēli ( in Latvian ) and Dievo Suneliai 1 in Lithuanian) are related not only mythologically but also ctymologically. Germanic evidence is newly derived from the heroic epic, Kudrun. The Iranian counterparts of Alvinau are believed to be Haurvatāt and Ameretāt. (Incidentally, the Aresta has demon Nahaithya ( Nāsatya ). This is so presumably because all divinities associated with warfare and with horse have been Tejected by the Zoroastrian religion.) Strangely enougb, DUMÉZIL secs the reflection of the Divine Twias also in Romulus-Remus.
It is claimed that cach member of this Divine Pair has a distinctive character.
The peculiar Vedic development of the mythology of the Divine Twins is characterised by the concept of Aditi attended upon by two cavaliers (es pointed out by PRZYLUSKI) and of thic honcy-whip of Ašvinau,
Oac an speak of an IE prototype of horse-sacrifice; but the Vedic Afvamedha in its totality has to be viewed as an Indian de clopment on account of the inclusion in it of the elements of the pre-Aryap human sacrilicc. The parallclism between the Aśva. medha and the Roman October Equus is noteworthy. Also notc worthy is the sexual aspect of the ritc in Vedic and Celtic tradi. tions (Vodic: the queen and the horsc; Celtic : thc Ling and the

mare) Among the Gauls, the proper name Epomeduos (Aśva. medha) is attested
(1x) Vedic religion and mythology received their first distinc tive characterisation during the proto-Aryan period when the common ancestors of the Vedic Aryans, Iranian Aryans, and Anatolian Aryans lived together presumably in the region of Balkh The concept of Rta or cosmic order and the binder&rsquo; gods Asura Varuna and Mitra, the Soma cult, and the peculiar fire cult are some of the principal exclusive features of the newly evolved &lsquo;Aryan&rsquo; religion
The fire cult of the proto Aryans, for instance, was different from the cult of Roman Vesta and Greek Hestia which latter was essentially the cult of the hearth It may be noted that in those traditions in which the linguistic cognates of the word agni are attested (Latin igns Slavonic ognis) the counterparts of the Agni cult are not to be met with In the Iranian tradition, on the other hand, the Agai cuit exists, but not the linguistic coge nate of the word agni The Avestan word for fire, namely, alar, may, however, be connected with Vedic Agor&rsquo;s epithet atharyu (x) The migration from Balkh to Saptasındhu and the early settlements in Saptasindhu, which had been beset with many im pedements (1rtrani) natural and human, gave rise to the mytho logy of irirahan Indra — the human hero who was transformed into a war god This was the result of mythologisation of history Understandably enough, the Rgveda, a major part of which cons titutes a saga of Aryan conquest and colonisation, is dominated by the figure of Indra (xi) Side by side with the hieratic religion centering round Varuna, Indra, Agni, and Soma, there existed several popular religious cults among the Vedic people Simuarly, in their new exwronments, the Yadio Aryans woofronted some pre Vedic non Aryan religious cults, which were widely spread and deeply rooted and which tliey could neither ignore nor over whelm They accommodated these popular and non Aryan cults into the framework of their religion and mythology Tlus becomes evident, for instance, in the mythology relating to Visou and Rudra. The obviously artificial association of the popular gods

with Indra, who, as it were, served as the philosophers&rsquo; stone in respect of the hieratic elevation of these gods, the tendentious suppression or transformation of somc of the original traits of the popular and non-Aryan religious ideologies, and the solarization of the originally non-solar divinities are some of the features of this process of hierarchisation of popular cults.
