This vs. presents the same problem as 4c: because of init. tā́ḥ, nom. pl. fem., the subject of ā́dadhuḥ has to be feminine, and there are several pl. feminines in play: the “insightful thoughts” (dhītí-) of 4a and the rivers (nadī́-) of 4b. But which one (or both)? In any case, presumably the subjects of 4c and 5 are the same -- though Sāy opts for “fingers” in this vs. but “rivers” in 4c.

The unspecified dat. (or with Re loc.) mahé ‘for/in great …” has too many possibilities for its referent, and I have made no effort to choose one.
