I have no idea who or what the Gandharva represents here. Ge suggests that it can be the Gandharva as Somabewacher or, alternatively, the sun, but the context gives no particular support to either identification. It would be desirable to connect this verse with the Emuṣa myth, but I do not see how to do that either. It should be noted, however, that the datival phrase brahmábhyaḥ … vṛdhé “to strengthen the composers of sacred formulations” is reminiscent of the datival phrase in vs. 8, an undoubted Emuṣa verse, stotṛ́bhyaḥ … nṛ́bhyo nā́ribhyo áttave “for the praisers, the superior men and their ladies, to eat.” Note in our phrase the “attraction” of the obj. brahmábhyaḥ into the dat. to match the inf. vṛdhé. Unless we wish to interpr. the phrase as passive, “for the composers … to be strengthened.” On the lexeme abhí √tṛd, see comm. ad IX.110.5. It is generally specialized for the drilling into the cave in the Vala myth, but that seems to give us no help here.

The one clear connection to the Emuṣa myth within the hymn is the adj.

abudhná- ‘bottomless’, which anticipates the name of the bow, bundá-, in the next vs. ### 06
Ge takes bundám in c as the object of nír āvidhyat ‘pierced’ that opens the verse. This requires assuming an aberrant meaning for the verb (‘abschiessen’ [shoot]), and I find it unlikely (so does Old, who also feels that the object should be the target of the verb). Instead, though it requires supplying a first object for the verb in a and a verb to govern the acc. in c, I take the three pādas as relatively syntactically independent and supply the boar as one object of nír āvidhyat, in addition to odanám in b. I take the first two pādas as shorthand for killed the boar, pierced the mountain, and got the porridge - the three signature actions in the Emuṣa story. Note that odanám is the object of bhinat ‘split’ in another condensed allusion to the Emuṣa myth in VIII.69.14. As for what verb to supply to govern bundám, I supply ‘took’ from yet another abbreviated version in VIII.45.4, the only other hymn in which bundá- is found: ā́bundám … dade. For a possible long-distance syntactic/formulaic relationship between 6a and 10d, see comments on vs. 10.

I take the phrase giríbhya ā́as expressing the freeing of the odanám from the mountains (pāda b), but it could also be read with pāda a with the sense of ā́+ abl.

“all the way to,” though in that sense the ablative usually follows (see Gr s.v. ā́), hence “He pierced the boar all the way to/through the mountains.” As noted ad vs. 5, bundá- is reminiscent of (a)budhná- in the immediately preceding mysterious Gandharva verse.
