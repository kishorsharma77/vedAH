This vs. propounds a novel version of divine-human interaction: it suggests that what a god wants from us -- the verbal and material offerings we make to him at the sacrifice -- he actually arranges to have available there. There seems no other way to read the ā́√kṛ ‘make (to be) here, bring here’ in b (… karat … ā́). This model almost reduces the human role to being middlemen in a loop connecting the god with himself, in contrast to the usual reciprocal model in which each side (divine / human) makes its own contribution.

In d éti appears to be used as an auxiliary with the participle bíbhrat (so also Hoffmann, with ref. to Delbrück, AiS 390), though Ge seems to take it as a full lexical verb (“… tragend auszieht”). Engl. “goes on X-ing” captures both the literal sense and the auxiliary function of the verb here.
