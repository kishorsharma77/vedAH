Sūrya  
Cakṣus Saurya  
5 verses: gāyatrī  
The sun as the eye in heaven, which enables us to see ourselves and the world, is  the theme of this hymn, especially of the last three verses (3–5). The first verse is a request for universal protection in all parts of the cosmos; the ablative (“from”)  phrases are ambiguous: they may refer to hostile forces located in the various parts  of the cosmos, or to the locations from which the protectors are exercising their  function. The second verse to Savitar continues the protection theme, but otherwise  ill fits the hymn and may be here because of Savitar’s role in verse 3.  
The given name assigned to the poet by the Anukramaṇī, Cakṣus, is simply  adopted from the common noun cákṣus “eye” found repeatedly in verses 3–4; his  patronymic means “Son of Sūrya.”
