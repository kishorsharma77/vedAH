The sense of pāda d is somewhat unclear and the various tr. incompatible.

Ge’s “wir möchten euch mehr gelten als das eigene Heim” seems esp. difficult to wring out of the Skt., though the other possibilities he suggests in the n. (24d) are somewhat more likely. I start with the abhí √as lexeme, which generally means ‘surmount, dominate, be superior’, which doesn’t seem to be reflected in the Ge suggestions. However, in my interpr. the enclitic vaḥ has only the vaguest syntactic connection to the clause. I do not have a better solution.
