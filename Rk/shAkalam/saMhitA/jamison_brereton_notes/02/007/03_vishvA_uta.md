The simile marker iva is wrongly placed, in that it follows both parts of the simile “watery streams” (dhā́rā udanyā̀).

The verse contains several tricks involving word order. First, the first word of the vs., víśvā(ḥ), and the last, dvíṣaḥ, belong together: “all hatreds.” Their extreme distraction may be iconic of the distance that we must cross to pass beyond them.

Notice that they are also near rhyme forms. Further, there is a clever grammatical switch between vss. 2 and 3: 2c ends with (utá) dviṣáḥ (abl. sg.) / 3c with dvíṣaḥ (acc.pl.), and 3a begins with víśvā(ḥ) (utá). As just noted, this opening víśvā(ḥ) is to be construed with the distant 3c dvíṣaḥ, not with the dviṣáḥ immediately before it -- even though they seem bracketed together, sandwiched in by utá's, with phonologically similar tásyā immed. before and tváyā immed. after: tásyā utá dviṣáḥ // víśvā utá tváyā.
