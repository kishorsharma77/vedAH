Indra  
Nodhas Gautama  
9 verses: triṣṭubh  
The fondness of Nodhas for initial repetition is on display in this hymn, where  almost every verse begins with t(u)vám “you,” with a distracted vocative ind(a)ra positioned after an early caesura. The hymn lacks the verbal intricacy of the last  two (I.61–62), though it is full of philological problems.  
The tone of the hymn also differs from the two previous ones: it is far more  martial and concerned with Indra’s fearsome power. His aggressive power, even just  after birth, is highlighted in verse 1, and the following verses quickly allude to the  destruction of various foes, usually for the benefit of one of his clients (e.g., Kutsa,  vs. 3) or for mortals in general. Like the last two hymns, this one ends with a sum  
mary verse applicable to the “Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation.
