The hapax voc. punaḥsara may be a word play with sārameya. Bollée (Gone to the Dogs in Ancient India, 43) tr. “recessive one,” indicating that the dog is in retreat. But the rest of the context suggests an aggressive dog on the attack.

On the intens. dardar- here, see Schaeffer (136), who cites a very similar Avestan passage.
