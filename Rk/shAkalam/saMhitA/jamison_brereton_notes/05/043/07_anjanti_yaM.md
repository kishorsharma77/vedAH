On the position of this vs. in the hymn and its significance, see publ. intro. If the vs. is an omphalos, it may focus attention on the mysteries of the Pravargya ritual.

The vs. is structured as a riddle, with the referent of yám (pāda a) withheld till d, with three similes and several technical references to ritual activities in between.

The first simile (pāda a) is oddly structured, in that one expects something to be compared to the unidentified acc. yám but there is no overt acc. expressed. Instead we must supply this acc., as the most likely object of the participle pratháyantaḥ ‘spreading’ (transitive), which, in default of the acc. obj. itself, carries the simile particle ná. The object to be supplied is barhíḥ ‘ritual grass’, which at every ritual is spread as a seat for the visiting gods. Generally the verb in the expression “spread (barhis)” is √stṛ ‘strew’, not √prath, but, as Old points out, √prath can also be used, generally for the intransitive sense “(barhis) spreads” (V.5.4, X.70.4, etc.). The object of transitive √prath is generally something much more prominent, like ‘earth’.

It may be that √prath was used here to give a cosmic resonance, but it may also be partly ascribed to the alliteration in the vs.: prathayanto ... víprā, vapā́vantam ...

tápantaḥ / pitúr ná putrá upási práyiṣṭha(ḥ). The barhis is also sometimes anointed; cf. II.3.4 barhíḥ … ghṛténāktám. Thus, the absent barhíḥ is at the intersection of the two ritual verbs ‘spread’ and ‘anoint’, and supplies the missing point of comparison in the simile “They anoint ‘which one’ (yám) like X.” The poet is inviting his audience to solve for two variables -- the identity of the focus of the vs. expressed by the rel. prn. yám and the object to which it is compared, but he makes the second riddle easier by providing two verbs that could govern it. The overlap of the two produces the answer.

The next simile, in b, targets a different ritual substance to compare with the still unidentified yám. This time an accusative does appear on the surface, but it in the form of an associated adjective, vapā́vantam ‘possessing the/an omentum.” In classical śrauta ritual the omentum (vapā́) is the first and probably the most important part of the sacrificial animal to be dealt with; after the death of the animal, the omentum is removed and heated on two different fires, first preliminarily singed on the Śamitar’s fire (NB: see vs. 4 and comm. thereon), then cooked on the Āhavanīya fire (see my Hyenas, pp. 104-5). Here we can assume that what is identified as ‘possessing an omentum’ is the sacrificial animal (an identification supported by the occurrence of vapā́vantam in ŚB XIII.7.1.9), which itself is cooked on the fire. Sacrificial animals are also anointed; see IV.6.3 paśvó anakti in a hymn that treats the animal sacrifice in some detail. Once again, the incompletely identified target of the simile is at the intersection of two ritual actions: ‘heat’ and ‘anoint’. In this case the similarly unidentified yám, the gharma pot, is also subject to both these actions in the Pravargya ritual.

The third simile, in pāda c, is the only one with all its parts, and is also the only one without a ritual reference. It is a version of a standard trope.
