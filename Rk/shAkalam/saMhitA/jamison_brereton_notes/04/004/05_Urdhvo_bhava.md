The standard tr. supply ‘powers’ with daívyāni, and this certainly could make sense. However, no word meaning ‘power’ occurs with pl. daívya- (I must admit that sáhas- occurs several times with the sg.) nor as obj. of āvíṣ √kṛ ‘make manifest’.

Since we expect something visual as the obj. of such a verb and since the hymn so far has concerned the shape-shifting of Agni, I tentatively supply ‘forms’ -- though ‘powers’ is not excluded contextually.

The adj. sthirá- ‘taut, firm’, esp. when obj. of áva √tan, presupposes ‘bows’ as its head noun; cf. the bahuvrīhi sthirá-dhanvan- (VII.46.1) and phrases like VIII.20.12 sthirā́dhánvāni.

The more usual interpr. of cmpds with final root noun is OBJ + TRANS. VERB, and this seems to be the sense of many of the fairly numerous cmpds in -jū- (e.g., vasū-jū́- ‘speeding goods’), though Scar (166-77) hesitates in several cases.

However, in yātu-jū́- the final member must be read passively with agentive 1st member: ‘incited by sorcerers’, as VII.21.5, adduced by both Ge and Scar (173), definitively shows: ná yātáva indra jūjuvur naḥ “Sorcerers do not incite us, Indra.” On the number disharmony in the obj. phrase in d, jāmím ájāmim … śátrūn, see comm. ad VI.44.17.
