Both hemistichs open with a distracted 2nd sg. acc. pronoun (t u vā́m). The accusative of this pronoun is, of course, historically monosyllabic, though distraction is not uncommon in the RV. Here the distraction may have resulted from matching the distracted nominative sg. form that opened the 2nd hemistich of the previous vs., 23c.

The impf. amadan in b is wrongly tr. as a present in the publ. tr.: correct to “did … applaud.” This may continue the account of the Vala myth, with the “very attentive poets” being the Aṅgirases themselves. It seems unlikely that it is the first action of the soma-stealing myth found in c.

Once again the Pp. analyzes ā́/ abharat, but the sequence could instead be ā́/ bharat with an injunc.
