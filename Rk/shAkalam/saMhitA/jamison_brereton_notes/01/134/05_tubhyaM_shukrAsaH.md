Note the plethora of -an-forms in abc: turaṇyávaḥ, iṣananta, bhurváṇi (2x).

In b iṣananta bhurváṇi is echoed by iṣanta bhurváṇi in the tag-pāda c. WG take iṣananta and iṣanta to two different verbs (“treiben” and “wünschen” respectively), but as Re remarks, the formal variation is insignificant in Atyaṣṭi (see duhre, duhrate in 6fg below), and it would be far more disruptive to this structure to change the verb root in the echo. This twinning of iṣananta and iṣanta here makes it likely that the former has only minimal connections to the other forms belonging to a stem iṣaṇa-, otherwise confined to the Indra hymns of IV. See comm. ad IV.16.9.

I take bhurváṇi as an adverbial complement to the verb (“set themselves aquiver”)(sim. Old and Re), and therefore in c I am reluctant to construe apā́m with bhurváṇi as Ge (and differently WG) do. My solution, which is admittedly ad hoc, is to supply a simile containing *ūrmáyaḥ (cf., e.g., IX.95.3 apā́m ivéd ūrmáyas tárturāṇāḥ for soma drinks [as here] compared to waves of water constantly in motion).

In its two occurrences (I.151.5, X.91.2) takva-vī́- ‘(in) swooping pursuit’ refers to a bird of prey. In this passage most tr. take tsā́rin- ‘stealthy one’ as a hunter in pursuit of game; this may be correct and is reflected in the publ. tr. However, it’s possible that the stealthy one is the bird of prey, becoming weary as he circles in the air (“in his swooping pursuit” takvavī́ye). It might seem odd for the bird to “reverently invoke” Indra, but this is hardly beyond the range of RVic discourse.

The verb pāsi in fg is universally taken as belonging to √pā ‘protect’, and this is morphologically the easier interpretation: it would be a straightforward root present. However, context favors a connection with √pā ‘drink’. As Old points out, dhármaṇā is used in IX.25.2, 63.22 to refer to Vāyu’s right to the first drink of soma, and the next verse here, 6abc, spells out this entitlement in almost over-literal detail; it can be considered a species of poetic repair, making it clear that pāsi here belongs to ‘drink’. (See also I.135.1de.) Moreover, “protect from every creature” seems an odd expression, since “creatures” are generally positively viewed or at least neutral.

The problem with ‘drink’ of course is that this root makes a root aorist, not a root present. But at least one other form with primary endings is universally taken to the ‘drink’ root: pānti in II.11.14, which in fact describes the same situation as here, Vāyu’s first drink of soma: prá vāyávaḥ pānty ágraṇītim “The Winds drink the first offering.” These two primary forms may be nonce presents or subjunctives (in which case the tr. here should be “you will drink …”), or pāsi here could be a nonce -si imperative.

I take the two abl. in fg in different senses: víśvasmād bhúvanāt as a temporal expression, but asuryā̀t as causal.
