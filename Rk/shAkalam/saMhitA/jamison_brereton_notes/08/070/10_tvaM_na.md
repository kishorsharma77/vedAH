The lexeme ní √tṛp occurs only here (in all of Sanskrit, as far as I can tell). I interpret the ní as reversing the meaning of the root verb, as sometimes elsewhere (see Jamison 1983: 86 for some other examples) - hence ‘be unsatisfied’ < √tṛp ‘be satisfied’. Scar also seems to interpret the verb in this fashion (“… bist du unzufrieden”), but does not comment on why. Gr ‘verzehren’ (consume), Old ‘sich sättigen’. Since tṛmpáti is ordinarily construed with a genitive, I take tvānídaḥ as a gen. sg., not acc. pl., as Gr and Ge take it. Scar allows either possibility, and Old favors the gen. My interpretation is thus rather distinct from Ge’s “du hast deine Schmäher satt” (have your fill of), though his also conveys a negative sense.

The girding motif of c must indicate some kind of preparation for battle, but what exactly the equipment and procedure were is not clear.

I have, reluctantly, interpreted the injunctive śiśnathaḥ in d as an imperative, as also in VIII.24.25. So also Ge in both passages. It would be possible here (less so in VIII.24.25) to interpret it modally “you will jab down…” or even as a timeless statement “you jab down…” Note the play of #t u vám…, #t u vanído … / … tuvinṛmna
