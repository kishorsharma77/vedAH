The problem in this vs. is maha (sandhi form) in b bṛ́haspatir no maha ā́ sakhāyaḥ. The Pp reads this as mahe, as do most subsequent interpr. -- though mahaḥ is possible and is in fact the interpr. of at least one tr.: HPS takes it as the voc. pl. of máh-, construed with sakhāyaḥ, hence “ihr grossen Freunde.” But this seems unlikely: there are no voc. forms to this stem in the RV (though the derived fem.

mahī́- does have some), and the intrusion of ā́in the middle of the voc. phrase seems unlikely. Others accept the Pp mahe and generally take it as a 3rd sg. verb, but opinions differ on its root affiliation and meaning. I will not detail these disagreements; see the disc. in Old, Ge’s n. 2b, Re ad loc., and Gotō 243-44. My interpr. is closest to Gotō’s: he assigns this to a root √mah ‘bring about’, separate from √mah ‘magnify’, with a t-less 3rd sg. of the śáye type (see also comm. ad I.94.1) and tr. “Bṛhaspati ist für uns imstande.” I differ from him in the interpr. of the rest of the pāda: he takes ā́as the trigger of an unexpressed verb of motion, “[kommet] o Genossen herbei.” This seems to assume that the friends addressed are not coreferential with naḥ earlier in the pāda, or the referents of the 1st ps. verbs in pādas a and c. I do not entirely understand the position of ā́, but it may show the occasional positioning of a preverb immediately after its verb or simply be an adverbial ‘here’, as in my tr.

As Re points out, the optative (bhávema) is quite unusual in a yáthā purpose cl., where the subjunctive is standard. See Gr s.v. yáthā, cols. 1083-84, nos. 6-8. 124
