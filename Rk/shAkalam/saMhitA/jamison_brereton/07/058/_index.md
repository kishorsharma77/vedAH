Maruts
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭub
A description of the fearsome power of the Maruts, embodiments of the thun derstorm, begins the hymn (vss. 1–2), but the topic turns to their power to help  the poet and his patrons in verses 3–4, with the mythic model, their aid to Indra,  invoked briefly in verse 4. In verse 5 the potential anger of the Maruts is men tioned, and we seek to atone for whatever act occasioned it. Like the human  offense punished in verse 4 of the previous hymn, VII.57, this moral tone is  somewhat out of place in a Marut hymn. However, here the reference to the  Maruts’ father, Rudra the punisher and healer, provides a better context for this  scene of anger and atonement. The final verse (6) is a summary verse, referring  to the performance in the immediate past of the praise hymn that constitutes the  first five verses.
