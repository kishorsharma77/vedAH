As Old points out (see publ. intro.), this is no doubt the last vs. of this collection of tṛcas, with vss. 16-19 later additions. There is some faint sign of ring composition with the first tṛca: súdhitāni in pāda a reprises súdhitam in 2a, as dadhīta with Agni as object does dadhúḥ also in 2a. The last three pādas of this vs., esp. de, appear to be a refrain: pāda e is identical to VI.2.11e = 14.6e in this Agni cycle, and pāda d ágne víśvāni duritā́tarema is a variant of VI.2.11d = 14.6d dviṣó áṃhāṃsi duritā́tarema, hence my supplied “narrow straits” here. These refrain pādas also signal that the hymn (or the tṛcas loosely collected into a hymn) once ended here.

On the anomalous position of hí here, see comm. ad III.31.12, where the idiosyncratic behavior of √khyā is discussed. Here the immediate preverbal position of hí is esp. anomalous because the preverb abhí has been fronted (as opposed to III.31.12 … ví hí kyán #, where the preverb stays in the verb complex).
