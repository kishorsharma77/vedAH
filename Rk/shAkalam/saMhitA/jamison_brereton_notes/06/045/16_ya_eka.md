As Old notes (though not in those terms), we seem to have an embedded main clause here -- in that tám u stuhi forming the second part of pāda a interrupts the rel. cl. that begins the vs. (yá éka íd) and continues through the rest of b and c, with the accented verb jajñé in c. Since yá éka íd is in fact only a single constituent, it might be best to consider it fronted around the brief main cl.
