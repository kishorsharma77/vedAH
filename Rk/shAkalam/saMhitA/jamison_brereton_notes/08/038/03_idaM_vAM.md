Pāda a can of course be in the acc. (not nom. as I take it) and form a single sentence with b (so Ge). There are no implications either way, but I prefer to take fronted forms of ayám as annunciatory (“here is …”) if at all possible. However, given initial imā́(5a) and imā́m (6a), which can’t be so tr., this is not a strong arg.
