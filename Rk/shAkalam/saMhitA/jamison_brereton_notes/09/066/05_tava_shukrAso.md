This vs. seems to unite Soma’s two theatres of operation, as laid out in vss. 2-3, the cosmic and the ritual. His “gleaming rays” (reminiscent of the sun) spread both “on the back of heaven” (divás pṛṣṭhé) and across the ritual filter (pavítram); the instr. dhā́mabhiḥ “through your domains” can make reference both to this combining of cosmic and ritual and also, more specifically, to the limited ritual domains expressed by the pl. dhā́māni in vs. 3.

Re’s characterization in his n. - “Soma-soleil …; en fait, l’image rituelle se combine avec l’image solaire” - expresses this rather nicely, though it’s hard to get it from his tr. On the likening of the soma liquid on the filter to the sun, see IX.10.5 and comm. thereon.
