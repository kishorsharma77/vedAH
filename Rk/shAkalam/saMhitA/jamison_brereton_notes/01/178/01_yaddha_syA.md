The crucial word śruṣṭí- is ambiguous: it may refer to the attentive hearing Indra gives to our praises and desires or to the obedience (based on our “attentive hearing”) that we have shown towards Indra. The publ. tr. reflects the first possibility, but I think both may be meant, though Indra’s role as a hearer in 3b may support the first interpr. The other exx. of śruṣṭí- are not clearly diagnostic.

Ge takes “us” (naḥ) as the implicit obj. of maháyantam (“der uns gross macht”), but maháya- ordinarily takes a god (indeed ordinarily Indra) as obj., and most tr. so render it.

For the difficult phrase páry ā́pa āyóḥ, see publ. intro. It is variously rendered in the standard tr.
