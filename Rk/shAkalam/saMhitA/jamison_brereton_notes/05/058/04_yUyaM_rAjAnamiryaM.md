The wrong sandhi in d yuṣmád sádaśvo is found in both Aufr. and HvN, but the Max Müller ed. has the correct yuṣmát. So, a copying error going back to Aufr., presumably generated from the yuṣmád beginning c.

The sense of írya- is disputed, and it has no secure etym. (see EWA s.v. írin-).

Schlerath (Königtum) suggests that it’s a deriv. of írā- ‘refreshing drink’, meaning ‘Nass spendend’, and this suggestion has been adopted by Oberlies (RdR II.178).

However, this does not work in all passages, nor with írin- (V.87.3) if that is related.

It seems best to follow the old standard gloss ‘regsam, rührig’, etc., and the posited connection to √ṛ ‘arise’, etc. (see EWA loc. cit.).

There are two approaches to the interpr. of vibhva-taṣṭá-. One assumes that the first member is a PN, the name of one of the Ṛbhus (so Re, WG). One of the occurrences of the cmpd is in a Ṛbhu hymn, IV.36.5, in a vs. with both a form of the word ṛbhú- and the name of another Ṛbhu, vā́ja-. There the PN interpr. seems correct or at least a pun. However, in the other passages, III.49.1, V.42.12, and this one, all lacking a strong Ṛbhu presence, it seems best to see a more general meaning. Ge seems to follow this course (here and III.49.1, though not V.42.12) but his “vollendeten” doesn’t give much hint as to how he interprets the first member.

The hapax sád-aśva- appears to be the only RVic cmpd with the first member sa(n)t- -- assuming, with most, that sát-pati- contains a reduced form of sádas- ‘seat’ (see EWA s.v.). I take it as semantically related to the derived adj. sátvan-, of warriors ‘the real thing’. So ‘(having) true horses’ in the sense of “good men and true”; English “trusty” works well. We might have expected s(u)váśva- ‘having good horses’ parallel to suvī́ra- at the end of the pāda, but perhaps the poet wanted to vary the expression.
