Although we don’t ordinarily think of Indra as ‘seeking help’ (avasyú-) but giving it, in this myth Indra goes to the house of Uśanā Kāvya to receive the mace from him. I therefore think that the ‘help’ Indra is seeking is concretized as the mace.

See below on pāda d.

Note that ī́śānaḥ in b echoes iṣaṇo in 9c.

In d the two words áhan pā́ryāya have provoked a certain amount of discussion (see Old, Ge n. 11d, Kuiper, IIJ 5: 169ff., who is followed by Hoffmann, Injunk. 189 n. 151, and WG) because of its similarity to the expression diví pā́rye “on the decisive day” (VI.17.14, etc.). The dat. pā́ryāya here is therefore taken by some as a temporal expression with a word for ‘day’ or the like to be supplied (e.g., Old pā́ryāya *áhne). However, the dative expression nearby in IV.25.1 mahé ‘vase pā́ryāya “for great, decisive help” (though see alternative tr. of Ge [/WG]) seems the more compelling comparandum, esp. since Indra has come to UK’s seeking help (avasyúḥ 1a). By following áhan with the stem pā́rya-, the poet may be tricking us into expecting a temporal expression (cf. VI.26.1 pā́rye áhan; also III.32.14), but the case mismatch should alert the audience that our expection has been thwarted. As indicated in the comm. ad pāda a, I think the “decisive help” that UK gives Indra is the mace he fashioned; it’s important to note that in another telling of this myth in I.121.12 the mace itself is called pā́rya-: I.121.12cd yáṃ te kāvyá uśánā … dā́t, … pā́ryaṃ tatakṣa vájram “UK fashioned the decisive mace which he gave to you.” For UK giving Indra the mace, see also V.34.2.
