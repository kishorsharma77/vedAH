The three pādas contain three 2nd sg. verb forms belonging to √yaj, two pres.

imperatives yájā (a, b) and a so-called “si-imperative” yákṣi (c). Though “siimperatives” do often function as imperatives, they are haplologized -s-aorist subjunctives by most accounts. I so tr. yákṣi here, since the poet could easily have repeated yájā in this context; it would have been metrically fine and in fact would have produced a more iambic pattern. It is accented because it follows an extrasentential voc. For another si-imperative that is better rendered as a subjunctive see ní … satsi in I.76.4 in the next hymn.
