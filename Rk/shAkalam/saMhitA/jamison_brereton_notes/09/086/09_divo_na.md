The rel. cl. of b lacks a verb. I think that whatever is supplied must be able to be construed with dhármabhiḥ “according to (his) ordinances.” My ‘abide’ is a slight elaboration on Ge’s ‘sind’: “durch dessen Bestimmungen Himmel und Erde sind,” which I think is fundamentally correct. This is another hyperbolic statement of Soma’s cosmic power. Re’s “lui à qui (appartiennent) le ciel et la terre avec les choses-à-maintenir” separates yásya from dhármabhiḥ and finds little work for the instr. pl. to do. The two instances of dhármabhiḥ (here and 5c) should be more or less in harmony.
