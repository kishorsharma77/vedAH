This vs. contains several syntactic ambiguities of not much moment. The rel.

prn. yé in the 1st hemistich can in principle be picked up either áśvāsaḥ ‘horses’ or eṣām ‘of them [=Maruts]’, and in fact either the horses or the Maruts could easily be compared to birds. I don’t see any way to decide, though it’s true that the default ref.

of any masc. pl. in a Marut hymn is the Maruts.

In b bṛhatáḥ can in principle be acc. pl., gen. sg., or abl. sg., so that it could technically modify any of the three nouns in that pāda: acc. pl. ántān, gen. sg. diváḥ, or abl. sg. sā́nunaḥ, and it is found with both diváḥ and snóḥ (alt. form of sā́nunaḥ) elsewhere. With the standard tr., I take it with ‘back’. Flg. Ge and Re, I assume that the ‘back’ is heaven’s -- and in fact the gen. diváḥ could be read both with ántān and with sā́nunaḥ, between which it is positioned. WG suggest rather that it’s the back of the earth, namely the mountains, and this is worth considering. If they’re coming from the mountain, it may explain why/how they have stirred the nabhanú- of the mountain. Still, the clear phrase diváḥ … sā́nu in the next hymn (V.60.3b) favors ‘heaven’.

On nabhanú- see comm. ad IV.19.7.
