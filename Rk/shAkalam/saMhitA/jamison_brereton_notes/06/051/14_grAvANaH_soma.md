The unusual position of hí, normally a 2nd position element, is due to immediately following kam. For whatever reason (and I don’t know it), hí kam is a phrasal unit, whether it occurs in expected 2nd position (I.98.1, II.28.8, VIII.11.10) or not (VIII.44.24, IX.49.4, X.100.5). II.37.5 may provide a transition between the two, since the hí kam sequence is not pāda-initial there, but it is in 2nd position in its clause.

The standard treatments (Gr, Ge, Re) take vāvaśúḥ to √vaś ‘wish for’, but Kü (477-80) has argued persuasively that morphological factors favor instead a connection with √vāś ‘bellow’ -- though he allows for a secondary contamination from the former root for a sense “sehnsüchtig brüllen.” I am in complete agreement.

The most salient feature of the pressing stones is their noise, and so bellowing for Soma’s companionship like the bovines that are the usual subjects of √vāś makes perfect sense.

See comm. ad vs. 13 for the four-syllable pāda consisting of the nominal sentence vṛ́ko hí ṣáḥ. As I argued in my 2009 “Function of Animals in the RV” (Paris animal vol., 206-9, esp. 208), the wolf is a cross-category in RVic classification, and this statement is a quasi-legal declaration that a particular human evil-doer is an outlaw -- with parallels in other early Indo-European traditions.
