The root √svañj is ordinarily middle; it has only two active forms, this one (pariṣvájat) and the plupf. paryáṣasvajat in I.182.7. The latter can be explained as an áduhat-type remarking of the middle pf. ṣasvaje (see comm. ad loc.), but this active remarking of the them. pres. -ṣvájate is harder to explain. Gotō (1st Kl., 338-39) notes the prevailing middle voice and this anomalous act., but makes no attempt to account for it.
