I do not understand the function of the initial prá in b. Gr indicates that it belongs with dā́tave, and Keydana (Infinitive, p. 255) explicitly says that it must belong with dā́tave and is therefore in tmesis. Though this is not impossible, I am somewhat reluctant to accept this explanation in part because prá is relatively rare with √dā. I wonder if it signals the lexeme prá √as ‘be present, be prominent’, with the copula gapped. Fortunately, the interpr. chosen has almost no effect on the sense of the pāda.
