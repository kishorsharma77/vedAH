This verse has given rise to a number of different interpretations, which cannot be discussed in detail here. I interpret it in the framework of Proferes’s treatment of the joint clan-fire (see publ. intro.; also Fs. Klein), which must be kindled and tended by members of the separate clans working together. This cooperative and reciprocal enterprise is expressed by the phrase mithás tanū́ṣu “mutually among themselves” (at least in my interpretation; it has received varying tr., but with most rendering tanū́ṣu as ‘bodies’), by sáṃ jānata “they agree, act in unison” to the resonant lexeme sám √jñā (see publ. intro. to I.68 and esp. I.68.9), and by the middle voice of ichanta “they seek (from each other).” The rétaḥ they seek is, I think, the means of kindling the fire, though I admit that this is not a usual sense of that word. Again, as in 4cd, there is a contrast between joint action (sáṃ jānata) and each individual’s contribution to it (svaír dákṣaiḥ).
