Ge takes the footsteps or feet in c to be those of Indra’s horses, but on the basis of I.32.8 tā́sām áhiḥ patsutaḥśī́r babhūva “The serpent came to be lying at the feet of those (waters)” it should rather be the waters’ feet or footsteps. What these are conceptually is not clear - perhaps deeper pools in the riverbeds? - but the parallel is clear, and furthermore Indra’s horses take no part in the Vṛtra myth.
