Pūsaṇ  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
4 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 2  
This last hymn in the Pūṣan cycle in Maṇḍala VI is the only one in trimeter meter,  rather than the less formal dimeter. It pictures Pūṣan in a more cosmic context than  the previous hymns and ascribes rather more powers to him. The final verse (4),  probably with verse 3, refers to the apparent marriage of Pūṣan to Sūryā, daughter  of the Sun, a tale alluded to in passing earlier in this cycle.854 VI.59
