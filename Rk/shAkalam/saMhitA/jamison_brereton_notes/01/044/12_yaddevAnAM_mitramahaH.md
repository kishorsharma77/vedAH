Again, lexical echo, though in this case it’s the next-to-last word of the preceding verse: 11d dūtám / 12b dūtyàm.

Note the synaesthesia in the second hemistich, with the sounds of the river’s waves compared to the flashing of fire. The gen. agnéḥ here is a common noun referring to the substance fire, not to the god. Its parallelism with síndhoḥ, also pādainitial, helps ground this usage.

I.44.13-14: The emphasis on hearing in these verses is continued in the next hymn (vss. 2-3, 5, 7).
