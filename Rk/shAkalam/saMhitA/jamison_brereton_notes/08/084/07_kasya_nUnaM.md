The standard tr. take párīṇasaḥ as a partitive abl. (“from whose profusion do you quicken the thoughts”). My interpr. (“in profusion”) could support an adverbial ablative of this neut. noun, but I think it’s also possible that párīṇas- was reinterpr. as an adjective, on the basis of expressions like rāyā́párīṇasā (4x), originally appositives (“with wealth, with profusion”), but reanalyzable as noun-adj.

“with abundant wealth” by way of noun+instr. adv. “with wealth in profusion.” If párīṇasaḥ is an adjective, it can be an acc. pl. fem. agreeing with dhíyaḥ.

Contra the standard interpr., I do not take yásya te as coreferential, but interpret yásya as coreferential with kásya in the main clause and take te separately as either dat. or gen. My supplied “(presented)” is just there for ease of English parsing: pāda c is easily interpretable as a nominal clause, “(the man) whose hymns are for you at …” / “… whose hymns are yours …”
