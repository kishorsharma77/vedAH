Note the doubly marked superlative śréṣṭhatama- (also I.113.12), which therefore ought to be rendered as “the most fairest.” It must be nom., not voc., because of its accent, since in a standard voc. phrase it would be unaccented flg.

unaccented naraḥ.

It is somewhat notable that the Maruts are referred to éka-ekaḥ “one by one,” since they are usually not differentiated at all. ### 01-02 These two vss. contain a fairly high percentage of the total number of RVic 2nd pl. active pfs., with the poorly characterized ending -a on the weak stem: āyayá (1b), śeka, yaya (2b). Macd. (VG p. 358) lists only twelve forms in all of Vedic (some of which have more than one token) of the 2nd pl. act. pf., and one of these (anāha) is better interpr. otherwise (see comm. ad VIII.48.5).
