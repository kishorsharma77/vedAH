The sense of the injunc. vidaḥ here is uncertain, but my rendering in the publ. tr. as if it were a subjunctive is almost surely wrong. In general, 2nd sg. injunctives to thematic aorists have been taken as modal (see KH, Injunk. 263), and certainly Ge and Re both tr. this form as an impv. The sá opening the pāda supports the interpr. as an imperative substitute, since, by my rules (“Vedic ‘sá figé’: An Inherited Sentence Connective?,” Historische Sprachforschung 105 [1992]: 213-39), sá (and other nominative forms of this pronoun) are found with 2nd ps. ref. almost exclusively with imperatives. Hoffmann (loc. cit.), however, says that modal use of the various occurrences of vidaḥ is “nicht durchweg sicher.” Nonetheless I would now change the tr. to an imperatival “find fame for us,” because of the sá. I do not think that this calls my interpr. of vidā́ as an impv. in the preceding hymn (19.8) into question. See comm. there. For other occurrences of the form vidaḥ, see comm. ad I.42.7-9.
