In c jayā can be a 2nd sg. imperative with lengthened final (so Pp., Gr, Ge) or a subjunctive (jayāḥ out of sandhi). Although an undoubted form of the imperative is found in 12c (jaya), I weakly favor the subjunctive here, the idea being that the praisers keep praising the same deed, and so he will keep doing it.
