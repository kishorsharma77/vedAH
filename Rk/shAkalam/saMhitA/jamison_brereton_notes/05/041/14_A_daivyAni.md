Since Indra is several times called súmakha-, I assume he is the referent here -- though nothing much depends on it in this generic vs. and both Ge and Re take it to be the sacrificer or the patron of the sacrifice.

WG suggest that candrā́grā(ḥ) modifies both ‘days’ and ‘hymns’; this is a good idea, with ‘gold, gleam’ used in two slightly different senses. The days begin with the gleaming of the golden sun, while the hymns offered to the gods are metaphorically tipped with the gold given by the gods in response to praise.

In d udā́is generally taken as the instr. sg. of a root noun ‘water’ (so, e.g., Gr and all the standard tr., though Ge hesitates), beside the more common oblique nstem instr. udnā́. However, I follow Schindler (Root nouns, 12-13), who argues that it is better taken as the nom./acc. pl. to the same -n-stem.

The somewhat curious expression abhíṣātā árṇāḥ “conquered floods” finds its formulaic match in nearby V.50.4 árṇā … sánitā ‘winner of the floods’; this may well be a general reference to the progress of the Ārya into the Punjab, winning territory river by river. Ge cites as parallel I.131.5 té anyā́m-anyāṃ nadyàm saniṣnata “They kept winning one river after another.”
