Exactly what dhármavant- is conveying here is unclear, but it is highly unlikely to be, with Ge, “von Dharma [den Gesetz] … begleitet,” since ‘law’ is quite anachronistic for dhárma(n)-. I also do not think Re is correct in seeing it as a proper noun, despite its appearance in a -vant-stem parallel to those containing gods’ names.

Rather, the repetitive template of the tṛca imposes the -vant-stem here, on the abstract principle dhárman- generally associated with Mitra and Varuṇa -- here perhaps referring to their authority and its manifestation (their statute) by which they impose order on the world.
