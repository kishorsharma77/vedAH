The self-address of 13c seems important enough to repeat here in pāda with minimal variation, though the syntactic function of the acc. mā́rutam gaṇám is different and the rest of the vs. much less clear.

The first hemistich lacks a verb; the parameters of what to supply are set by the nominal arguments in a -- the seer is commanded (/commands himself) to [DO SOMETHING] to(ward) (ácha) the Marut flock -- and further limited by the simile in b, with the nom. maiden (yoṣáṇā) roughly corresponding to the seer and the acc. friend/ally (mitrám) to the Maruts. I have supplied ‘approach’, others ‘invite, address, turn’, etc., all more or less acceptable.

The question then is what the simile in b is conveying. Most of the renderings attribute bolder action to the maiden than I think gently bred Vedic girls would ordinarily undertake (see esp. Klein, DGRV II.183-84: “… like a maiden entices a friend”). My solution is to read dānā́twice in two different morphological interpr.

First, with the standard interpr., as the instr. sg. of ‘gift’ (on the possible stems, see EWA s.v. dāná-). But also as a root aor. mid. participle in the nom. sg. fem. with passive value. Although such a participle is not recognized by the standard grammars, it is exactly the form we would expect and fits the gift-marriage model perfectly. The mitrá- to whom she is given is presumably her spouse; on mitrá- in a wedding context see X.27.12 and my “The Rigvedic Svayaṃvara” (Fs. Parpola 2001), 309-13.

The final word of b, yoṣáṇā, is anomalously accented (vs. standard yóṣaṇā).

See below comm. ad 15b for a possible explanation. The second hemistich seems to be presented as a disjunctive alternative to the first, introduced by vā. The “or” does not make much sense; it is tempting to follow Re’s judgment: “vā irrationnel.” But Klein (II.184) may have rightly divined the rationale: “the poet first beseeches the Rishi to entice the Maruts to the worship, but then, as an alternative, appeals directly to the Maruts themselves to come.” I would tweak this slightly by suggesting that the action to which 14cd is presented as an alternative is not 14ab, but rather 13cd, of which 14a(b) is a variant. The ṛṣi orders himself to stop the Maruts with a song (13cd) but then suggests to them that they initiate the journey themselves (14cd).

The voc. dhṛṣṇavaḥ addressed to the Maruts again reminds us of the beginning of the hymn, with dhṛṣṇuyā́(1a, 2b, 4b) and dhṛṣadvínaḥ (2c).
