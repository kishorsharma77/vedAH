The phrase dyā́m utémā́m raises a number of questions. First, what is utá conjoining? Although it is tempting to suggest “heaven and this (earth),” this would produce the pragmatically unlikely “causing … this (earth) to rain.” Moreover, there are numerous exx. of prthiv ̥ ī́ṃ dyā́m utémā́m “earth and this heaven” (III.32.8, 34.8, X.88.3, 9, 121.1). It seems that the last part of that phrase, containing only the second NP, has been extracted from the fuller expression and inserted here, with the utá pleonastic, or loosely conjoining the participial phrases kṛṇvánn apáḥ and varṣáyan dyā́m utémā́m despite its position within the NP. On the clash between the near deictic ayám ‘this here’ and heaven, which is generally qualified by the distal deictic asaú ‘that yonder’, see disc. ad VIII.40.4 - also for the fem. gender that dyā́m must show here.

Ge tr. d as implicitly comparative, “mach uns die Bahn noch breiter als breit,” presumably because of the abl. uróḥ. But ā́with preceding abl. almost always expresses the source and is not used with a comparative. The few passages, grouped in Gr’s 7) “vor andern, d.h. in höherm vorzuglichern Grade als andere” (p. 169), that do show something like that sense (several in that category are best interpr.

otherwise) depend on ā́váram “the choice from among …” Moreover, varivasyádoes not have a comparative sense ‘make wider space’ but merely ‘make wide space’. In our passage the point seems to be that Soma is already positioned in a wide place, from which he can act to provide us with the same.
