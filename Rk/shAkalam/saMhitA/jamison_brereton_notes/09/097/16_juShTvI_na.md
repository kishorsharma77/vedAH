The vs. contrasts easy travel (a: supáthā sugā́ni) with difficult travel (c: duritā́ni); the contrast is signaled by su- / duṣ-, while two different roots for ‘go’ serve as 2nd cmpd. member, √gā (or √gam?) versus √i.

The part. kṛṇván in b should be supplied to govern supáthā sugā́ni in a.

Pace Ge and Re, I do not think naḥ should be construed with the ger. juṣṭvī́; it is simply in Wackernagel’s position and goes better with supáthā sugā́ni.

For the loc. uraú see III.54.9 uraú pathí.

For ghanéva see comm. ad I.63.5.
