Note both the phonological figure khé … khédayā and the etymological figure akhidat … khédayā. The sense ‘hammered together’ attributed to sám … akhidat may seem strange, given that √khid means something like ‘tear (out/apart)’. I assume that the lexeme and sense here were generated acdg. to the common sám / ví opposition to ví √khid ‘tear out/apart’, attested in AVP XVI.73.5 and KS XVII.15 as well as Śāṅkh. Br. II.9.
