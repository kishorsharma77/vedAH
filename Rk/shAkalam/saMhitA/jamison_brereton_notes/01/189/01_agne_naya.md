The dat. rāyé with √nī may go too easily into English as a goal, “lead to wealth”; ‘for wealth’ might be more faithful to the case form. However, I do not subscribe to WG’s interpr. of supáthā as a neut. pl. goal (“zu den Orten, wo gute Wege sind”), which seems awk. and unnec. when an instr. sg. works well and is paralleled elsewhere.

(víśvāni) vayúnāni vidvā́n is a standard phrase, used esp. of Agni (I.72.7, III.5.6, VI.15.10, X.122.2), referring presumably to his deep knowledge of the ritual as the god most enmeshed in ritual.

I take juhurāṇá- to √hvṛ / hru ‘go crookedly, go astray’ (with Ge and Re, as well as Gr), rather than with √hṛ ‘be angry’ with Insler (JAOS 88, 1968), apparently followed by WG (“den zürnenden Frevel”). The contrast between the easy path in pāda a and the énas- that goes crookedly/astray in c supports this ascription, as does abhihrút- in 6d. Agastya uses the same participle in I.173.11, where its affinity to √hvṛ rather than √hṛ is even clearer.
