For the ritual application of the various portions of this vs. see publ. intro.

Most tr. take góṣu and also perhaps apsú as the desired objects of battle (e.g., Ge “(im Kampf) um die Rinder”), but these seem to me to refer rather to the accoutrements of the soma sacrifice. The cows and the waters reappear in ritual context (at least in my view) in 4d and 5b respectively.

The standard tr. also supply a verb with pāda d, but this seems unnecessary.
