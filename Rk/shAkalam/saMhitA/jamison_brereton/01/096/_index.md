Agni (or Agni Draviṇodā “Agni Wealth-Giver”)
Kutsa Āṅgirasa
9 verses: triṣṭubh
Simpler and more straightforward than the previous hymn, this one shares a final  verse (9) as well as some themes with I.95: see especially verse 5, where Night and  Dawn suckle Agni, the calf, which matches I.95.1, where the two mothers were  unidentified.
A pāda-length refrain is found in the first seven verses; in the last two of these  (vss. 6–7) the refrain is integrated syntactically into the verse: pāda c with pāda d in  6, the whole verse in 7, while in the first five verses the refrain is independent. Agni  has the epithet “wealth-giver” in this refrain, and in the eighth verse (post-refrain)  that epithet, repeated four times, is the focus. This verse expresses the poet’s desire for  the various types of Agni’s “wealth,” a typical finale. In the earlier parts of the hymn  (vss. 1–5), however, it is not Agni’s material gifts that are dominant, but his ritual and  cosmogonic properties, though his relation to wealth surfaces in verses 6–7 (see also  4a). This gradual integration of the refrain into the fabric of the hymn, both syn tactically and thematically, shows how a skillful poet can deploy even something as  apparently inert as an invariant refrain in building a forward-moving composition.
