With Sāy I take the wakeful wild beast to be soma. The obj. of √svad is regularly an oblation, and in IX.105.1 its object, soma, is compared to a śíśu-, the young of an animal or human.

vā in b cannot be the disjunctive ‘or’, as there is no disjunction possible. I take it as the short form of iva ‘like’ (with lengthening), as Ge also seems to (on the grounds of his “sozusagen”), marking the statement as an approximative. Old’s comment is not entirely intelligible, but he seems rather to imply that vā expresses a strong positive, and I therefore assume he thinks it’s a form of vaí, as do Re and Klein (DGRV II.201-2).
