As has often been pointed out, the redupl. pres. to √han, jíghnate, almost always takes plural objects, and so, at least in this formation, reduplication seems correlated with repetitive action. This semantic nuance is strengthened here by the syntactic construction, with the redupl. pres. in the participle (jíghnamānaḥ) construed with a quasi-auxiliary cárasi. (Cf. 14b below.) Although cárasi does have lexical meaning (‘you range/roam/wander’), the lexical value is weak enough here that the verb can seem to be a marker of the progressive present: “you go about / keep / are (constantly) smashing.” On the other hand, it is possible that √car in its lexical value may be resonating with tuvikūrmí- ‘powerfully ranging’ in 3b (see comm. there). However, it is hard to know whether that root connection would still be perceived by the contemporary audience -- it certainly has escaped most of the modern audience -- given the phonological distance between the two words and the fact that tuvikūrmí- is simply an epithet of Indra and its own lexical value may have become attenuated.

There is a faint phonological echo between vṛtrā́in b and vratā́(ya) in d, which occupy the same metrical position.
