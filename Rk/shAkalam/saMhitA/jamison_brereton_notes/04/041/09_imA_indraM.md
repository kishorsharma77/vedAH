I read vásvaḥ twice, once as the complement of joṣṭā́raḥ in the simile (“those who enjoy a good thing”) and once in the frame with bhíkṣamāṇāḥ (“seeking a share of the goods”). Contra WG, I take śrávasaḥ only in the simile, since this part of the hymn seems all about our acquiring possessions, not fame.
