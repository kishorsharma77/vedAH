The hapax pāka-śaṃsá- is taken by some as a bahuvrīhi (implicitly, Gr ‘arglos redend’; cf. Whitney [AV VIII.4.9] “him of simple intent,” Brown “him of pure and single heart,” Doniger “the man of pure heart” [with śaṃsa- = ‘heart’?!]), but by accent it should be a determinative cmpd, contrasting explicitly with the bahuvrīhi aghá-śaṃsa- ‘having evil speech’ with 1st member accent, found in vss. 2 and 4. It is surely my guileless speech that is in question, since I was “acting with guileless mind” (mā pā́kena mánasā cárantam) in the immediately preceding vs (8a).

As Re points out, ví √hṛ probably refers to distortion of ritual speech.

Since pāka-śaṃsá- is a thing, not a person, the parallel bhadrám in b should also likewise be a thing (so Ge, Whitney, Lommel, Brown), not, as the publ. tr. (“an auspicious one”) has it, a person. I would thus take the form as a neut. acc. sg., not a masc. and slightly emend the publ. tr. to “something auspicious.” This something is probably also connected with ritual performance.
