On kṛchre-śrít- see most recently Scar (543-44). Re’s (EVP) objection to Ge’s tr. (“die Zuflucht in der Note”) and his over-complex substitute can, I think, reasonably be dismissed.

Most tr. take citrá-senāḥ as containing the ‘army’ word (e.g., Ge “eine wunderbare Heerschar bildend”), and this is certainly possible. I interpr. it rather as ‘weapon’ because of the proximity of íṣu- ‘arrow’ in the adjoining cmpd íṣubalāḥ ‘arrow-strong’.
