sukṛ́taḥ is multiply ambiguous. Though it literally means ‘doing/performing well’ / ‘of good action’, it is ordinarily specialized for performing the sacrifice well and refers to the human actors in the ritual. However, it can also on occasion be used of gods (e.g., X.63.9). In this passage most tr. take it as a gen. sg. referring to the sacrificer and dependent on adhvarā́n (e.g., Ge “zu den Opfern des Frommen”).

However, this leaves ā́vaha without an object. I therefore read sukṛ́taḥ as acc. pl., and in fact I read it so twice — once as obj. of ā́vaha and referring to gods (so also Gr) and once as the goal of ā́vaha and referring to the mortal sacrificers. The first reading seems confirmed by the first pāda of the next verse, 12a, which “repairs” the less clear expression with víśvān devā́m̐ā́vaha, using the same verb. The second reading, referring to the sacrificers, allows the yé of 11d to have an antecedent of the right grammatical number. It would of course be possible to take sukṛ́taḥ only once, as referring to the gods, assuming the gapping of a pronominal antecedent to yé, but this loses the neat equation of gods and sacrificers.
