All Gods  
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa  
10 verses: jagatī 1–5, virāṭsthānā 6, triṣṭubh 8–10  
Unlike Gotama’s often clever and verbally inventive hymns to particular gods, this  hymn to all the gods has a dutiful air, and the gods chosen for inclusion (or exclu sion) don’t seem to conform to any pattern. Still, there is a pleasing symmetry,  especially at the beginning and end. This feature is clear in the first two verses of the  hymn, where the word bhadrá “auspicious” is applied both to the ideas that mortals  will acquire and turn into the praise hymns for the gods and to the favors that the  gods will bestow on the properly worshiping humans in return. These unspecified  benevolent gods return toward the end of the hymn (vss. 8–9), and the particular  favor we desire from them is to secure our proper length of life (see esp. vss. 8cd, 9),  the very request with which the first verse pair ended (vs. 2d)  
In between are a series of verses invoking various gods and asking for their help.  The longest list is found in verse 3, but gods or cosmic forces are named in every  verse—from the very prominent, such as the various Ādityas (vs. 3) and Indra (vs.  6), to the obscure and marginal, notably Tārkṣya (vs. 6c), a deified racehorse, to  judge from its other appearance in the R̥gveda (X.178). The final verse (10) returns  to the Ādityan emphasis of verse 3 by identifying their mother Aditi with the most  important cosmic features, kinship relations, and beings.
