Sequential Deities ( for the R̥tugrahas)  
Gr̥tsamada  
6 verses: jagatī  
See the remarks on the previous hymn, as well as I.15.7–10. In that latter hymn,  as in this one, four verses are devoted to the offerings to the shadowy figure of the  Wealth-Giver (Draviṇodā); these verses may be there merely to bring the number  of offerings to twelve, to correspond with the secondary interpretation of r̥tú as  season, and hence to match the number of offerings to the months of the year, as  discussed in the introduction to I.15.
