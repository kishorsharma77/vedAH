Vāyu (1), Vāyu and Indra (2–7)
Vāmadeva Gautama
7 verses: gāyatrī
This simple hymn never strays from its ritual purpose:  at the Morning Pressing  of the soma sacrifice, Vāyu and then Indra and Vāyu receive the first offerings of  soma. Here they are urged to come to the sacrifice and drink their shares.
## 1
Drink the foremost of the honeys, the pressed (soma), o Vāyu, at the  rituals of daybreak,
for you are the first drinker.
## 2
With a hundred forms of help for us, (come,) provided with a team,  having Indra as charioteer.
O Vāyu—may you both become sated on our pressed (soma).
## 3
Indra and Vāyu, let your thousand fallow bays convey you here, to the  pleasurable offering,
to drink the soma.
## 4
O Indra and Vāyu, the chariot with the golden chariot box, good for the  ceremony,
touching heaven—because you will mount it—
## 5
With that chariot of broad dimension come up to the pious one.
O Indra and Vāyu, come here.
## 6
O Indra and Vāyu, here is the pressed (soma): in concert with the gods drink it in the house of the pious man.
## 7
Here be your advance, o Indra and Vāyu, (here) your unhitching, here for you to drink the soma.
