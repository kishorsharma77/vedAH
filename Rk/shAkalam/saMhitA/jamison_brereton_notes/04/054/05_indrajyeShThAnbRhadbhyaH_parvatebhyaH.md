The standard tr. here impose a different sense on √sū than in the previous vs. and one no more aligned with its usual semantics, i.e., ‘assign, direct’, with the interpr. that Savitar is assigning dwelling places to gods (the high mountains) and to men (pastyā́vataḥ, interpr. by Ge and Re as watery places, WG just dwellings). Old, however, resists the easy contextual shift and attempts to find an interpr. compatible with lexicon and grammar. (Among other things, he points out that unaccented ebhyaḥ should not introduce a new referent, ‘men’, into the discourse.) He does not settle on an interpr., however. My own interpr. assumes first that índrajyeṣṭhān refers to the Maruts, rather than the gods in general. (This stem sometimes modifies one, sometimes the other.) I also take párvatebhyaḥ not as dat., but abl. The Maruts tend to haunt the high mountains, but Savitar can dislodge them. He can also impel the clouds on which they (fancifully) dwell -- this is, in my opinion, the referent of kṣáyān … pastyā́vataḥ, with ebhyaḥ here a dative referring to the previously mentioned Maruts, thus properly unaccented. The 2nd hemistich announces that the famously hyperactive Maruts can be controlled by Savitar: they can fly widely, but they can also be brought to a standstill.
