Both Ge and Re take ab together, but I do not understand how the simile “like a king” (rā́jeva) would work with the VP (“you have entered the songs” gíraḥ … viveśitha). I have therefore taken the two pādas as separate clauses. The simile in pāda a then works well, since it makes perfect sense that a king should “possess good commandments” (suvratáḥ). The splitting of the two pādas gains further support from IX.57.3b, a pāda closely corresponding to our pāda a: íbho rā́jeva suvratáḥ, where there is no question of entering songs or any similar action and the shared quality of simile and frame must be suvratá-.

For further on the expression “enter songs” in pāda b, see publ. intro.
