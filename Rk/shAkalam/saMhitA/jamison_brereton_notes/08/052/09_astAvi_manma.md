The verse deploys a number of words for verbal offerings: mánma (a), bráhma (b), and medhā́ḥ (d). In c a feminine term needs to be supplied in the phrase pūrvī́r ṛtásya bṛhatī́ḥ “the many lofty ___ of truth.” I have supplied gíraḥ ‘songs’ from vs. 8, as it also shows up with pūrvī́ḥ elsewhere (VI.34.1, VIII.96.10, IX.85.11, X.29.5) -- though oddly when we get pūrvī́ḥ ... br̥hatī́ḥ, it's with íṣaḥ ‘refreshments’ (VI.1.2, IX.87.9), which wouldn’t fit here because it is not a verbal product. But note gíro bṛhatī́ḥ with the same verb in III.51.1 índraṃ gíro br̥hatī́r abhy ànūṣata. Ge supplies ‘words’, which would also work semantically, though he doesn’t specify which feminine noun he thinks it is (vā́caḥ perhaps?).
