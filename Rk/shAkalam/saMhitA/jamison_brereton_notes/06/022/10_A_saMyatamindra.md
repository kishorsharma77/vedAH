The main cl., occupying the first hemistich, has no verb; I supply dhiṣvá from 9a, though any verb of providing, giving, bringing would work as well (see Ge’s “bring”). The contrastive pair dā́śa- ā́rya-, juxtaposed in c, is a species of merism that would seem to encompass all the types of human obstacles we might encounter; nā́huṣāṇi in d appears to be an afterthought that focuses our enmity on a defined group within the larger whole.
