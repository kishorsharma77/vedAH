On my interpr. of this vs., see publ. tr. Both Ge and Re have quite different views.

Ge takes the asmin to be the sacrificer (flg. Sāy.), with the piśáṅgam … venám (my “tawny tracker,” his “den goldenen Seher”) “ein innerer Mahner” of this would-be stingy man. This anticipation of an Upaniṣadic-type Inner Controller seems anachronistic to me. Re simply -- in my opinion over-simplistically -- takes all elements to be soma in one form or another: the soma drops are urged to put “le (Soma) Veilleur à couleur-d’or” into the soma liquid.

This endless loop doesn’t seem to get us anywhere. I do agree with Re that soma/Soma is represented by two of the elements: the drops that are addressed (indavaḥ) are soma the substance and the “tawny tracker” is Soma the god. The drops are urged to put Soma the god into Indra (my interpr. of the referent of asmin); cf., from the same poet, IX.11.6 índum índre dadhātana.

The subj. of the infin. ādíśe is, in my view, the tawny tracker (i.e., Soma), though the act of placing this Soma in Indra may be part of the instruction. On the constr. see comm. on the almost identical expression in 6b.

Loc. asmin is unaccented and should therefore refer to something already present in the discourse, but that does not eliminate any of the just-given interpr.: Ge’s sacrificer, in the person of the ‘presser’ (súṣvi-), is found in 2, my Indra in 1, and Re’s soma is ubiquitous. In fact even without the mentions in vss. 1 and 2, the sacrificer and Indra are expected personnel on the scene in any Soma hymn.
