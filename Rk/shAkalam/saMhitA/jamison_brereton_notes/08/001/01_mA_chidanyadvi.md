In the publ. tr. I take ca in d as conjoining the two clauses found in c and d (so apparently also Ge and explicitly Klein, DGRV I.103, 105). However, given that the ca is somewhat wrongly positioned and that it reminds us of other ukth캐패ca passages, I now consider it possible that ukth캐패ca is part of a truncated conjoined NP.

See disc. ad VIII.82.4.
