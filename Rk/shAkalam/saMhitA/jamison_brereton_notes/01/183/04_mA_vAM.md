The first hemistich shows a nice phonological progression (noted also by Re): the zero-grade vṛk of the wolf and she-wolf (vṛ́ko … vṛkī́r) in pāda a develops into the full-grade vark of the etymologically and grammatically unrelated impv.

varktam in b, which is followed by the rhyming impv. dhaktam. In the 2nd hemistich the lexeme ní √dhā ‘deposit’ appears both as the verbal adj. ppl. níhita(ḥ) and the noun nidhí-.
