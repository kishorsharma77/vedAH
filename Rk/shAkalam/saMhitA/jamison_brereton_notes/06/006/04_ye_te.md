In my view (flg. Re), the rel. cl. of the first hemistich hangs off the previous vs. 3 and supplies the subject (śúcayaḥ ‘flames’) of vananti in 3d. However, Ge takes the rel. prn. yé as a stand-in for ‘wenn’, providing a subordinate clause to cd, with its resumptive ádha. The conspicuous alliteration of vs. 3, continued here (4a) — śukrā́saḥ śúcayaḥ śuciṣṃah, also a triple etymological figure — might be a weak arg.

in favor of a connection with vs. 3, esp. 3b śuce śúcayaḥ.

In b kṣā́m must be read disyllabically.

In the publ. tr. “like” should be enclosed in parens, as there is no overt simile marker in b. The question is why the flames are likened to “unharnessed horses” (víṣitāso áśvāḥ). Ge and Re think they are grazing, and this interpr. might fit well with vápanti ‘shear, shave’ -- a slightly different image of what happens to vegetation when fire moves across the earth: grazing “shears” the grasses like shaving does. However, I tend to think that víṣita- adds a different semantic dimension: horses out of harness racing about wildly without control.

In d the standard view (e.g., Ge, Re, Macd [Hymns, p. 74], Klein [DGRV II.106], Mau [p. 24]), fld. also in the publ. tr., is that the gen. pṛ́śneḥ, lit. ‘speckled, dappled’, refers to the earth. And this seems perfectly reasonable. However, it should be noted that pṛ́śni- is nowhere else unambiguously used of the earth in the RV.

Though Re (comm. ad loc.) suggests that there is such a ref. in IV.5.7, 10, those are desperately obscure passages and nothing can be built upon them. Generally pṛ́śninames the mother of the Maruts, who seems to have been a dappled cow, and “dappled (cow)” à “earth” is not a difficult step in RVic discourse. Still it should be kept in mind that it’s a step that hasn’t been taken elsewhere.
