The voc. rúśad-ūrme ‘o you possessing gleaming waves’ should, strictly speaking, not be accented. It may owe its accent to IV.7.9 krṣṇ̥ áṃ te éma rúśataḥ puró bhā́ḥ “Black is your course, (though) you are gleaming; your light is in front,” with a gen. sg. part. rúśataḥ following an identical opening. (So tentatively Bl RR.) Or perhaps as the first of two voc., in post-caesura position, it was felt to begin a new syntagm.
