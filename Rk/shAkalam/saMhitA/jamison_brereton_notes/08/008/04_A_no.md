The hapax voc. adhapriyā is clearly based on the slightly better attested kadhapriya-/-prī- (on which see comm. ad I.30.20), a form of which is found in the immediately preceding hymn VIII.7.31. The latter is a dismissive and slighting form of address (“when-friends?” -- that is, fair-weather friends) whereas adhapriyaseems to be the opposite: “now/here-friends,” that is, reliable friends.
