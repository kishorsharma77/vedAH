My interpr. of ápi √vat roughly follows Tichy’s (Die Spr. 26 [1980]: 3-5, esp. n. 8 [= KlSch 108-10]) ‘mit etw. (Akk.) bekannt, vertaut sein’ (contra Thieme’s Fs. Weller)—though perhaps with a bit more oomph.

I construe ṛtásya pathā́in b with yajñasā́dham in a, flg. Lü (Var. 463) -- contra most interpr., who take it as roughly parallel to the other instr. expressions in b. It is true that there is some distance between the two expressions I put together, and Ge also cites two parallels where ṛtásya pathā́is adjacent to námasā. However, in both those instances the two instrumentals are better taken with different parts of the verse, and since Lü’s interpr. yields richer sense, I maintain it here.
