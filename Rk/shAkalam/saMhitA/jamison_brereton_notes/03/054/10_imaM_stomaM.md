This vs. forms a sort of ring with vs. 1, enclosing the Heaven and Earth hymnlet of vss. 2-9. Like vs. 1 it begins with imám followed by a word for hymn (1a imám … śūṣám, 10a imáṃ stómam), and with 1cd it contains a verb form of √śru ‘hear’ with god(s) as subject (10b).

On ṛdūdára- see EWA s.v. ARD, though he is somewhat cagey about its formation. I assume the 2nd member is udára- ‘belly’, with the literal sense ‘moistbellied’ being equivalent to our ‘tender-hearted’. This assumes a bahuvrīhi with an adjectival first member of the form ṛdu-, a shape (disyllabic adj. ending in -i- or -u-) that often triggers (or is at least associated with) 2nd member accent in bahuvrīhis (see AiG II.1.296ff.).
