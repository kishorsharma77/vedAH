Indra and Agni The hymn begins with the voc. dual dvandva índrāgnī, and a form of that cmpd is found in 2d, 4b, 6a; vss. 3 and 5, which lack the cmpd., begin with dual pronouns (táyoḥ and tā́respectively), while dual forms of both the demonst. and the rel. pronoun are also common elsewhere in the hymn.
