I take kúśara- as containing the pejorative ku-prefix (as in kú-yava- ‘(bringing) bad harvest’) and a play on the preceding word śará-.

The three vṛddhi derivatives, sairyá-, mauñjá-, and vairiṇá-, I interpret flg.

Sāy.’s suggestion for the last two, namely that they refer to the adṛ́ṣta- bugs found on those particular grasses. Many of the most annoying biting insects lurk in tall grass waiting for their victims to present unshielded ankles and calves -- in the US chiggers, fleas, and ticks come to mind.
