The unaccented voc. ṛtāvṛdhāv opening the 2nd pāda has been thus transmitted, though we would expect *ṛ́tāvṛdhāv. In fact there is a striking string of 13 unaccented syllables in this hemistich, starting after the first word of the vs., ṛténa (14, counting -na). See Old, who has no good explanation for the lack of accent on the first word of the 2nd pāda, though he considers it an old error. It cannot be simply a peculiarity of this hymn, because I.3.1b (forming part of the Praügaśastra sequence with I.2, as discussed in the publ. intro.) opens with an initially accented voc. drávatpāṇī (to the stem dravátpāṇi-).
