Ge takes víśveṣāṃ as referring to the soma drops (“… den Saft des Honigs all der Somasäfte”), and this interpretation has the advantage of providing a plural referent in the main clause for plural yé … índavaḥ in the relative clause.

Nonetheless, I take it instead as qualifying naḥ ‘us’, to indicate the totality of the Ārya sacrificial community, near and far, as described in cd (and also 4cd). As indicated in comments on the previous Vālakhilya hymns, improper relatives abound, with mismatch between number and person, and so the lack of a plural referent for yé … índavaḥ would not be problematic. However, Ge’s interpretation is certainly possible.
