As noted in the publ. intro., the “pot” that is to be kicked is mostly likely an stingy patron, as Ge suggests. The whole vs. has a slangy and informal feel.

The problematic pāda is b. On the one hand, if we take the voc. indo seriously, this leaves ná badly positioned for a simile marker: it should follow dā́nam. But if dā́nam is supposed to be a simile, the expression is pretty slack: if dā́nam is ‘gift’, we want Soma to push the gift itself, not something compared to a gift. For both reasons Ge suggests that ná marks not a standard simile but an Utprekṣā, and, even so, that ná is in the wrong position.

Re’s tr. seems to follow this view, though it’s somewhat hard to square with his comm. Old suggests emending indo to índro, which allows ná to be properly positioned for a simile and also produces a reasonable, if not particularly interesting simile, “give (him/it) a shove, as Indra (does) a gift.” My solution is quite different and, once again, perhaps over-tricky, but I think it captures the tone of the vs. better. I take dā́na- not as ‘gift’, but rather as the med.

root aor. participle to √dā ‘give’. The immediate problem with this is, of course, that that form should rather be accented *dāná-. But given that the RV attests both dā́na- and dānámeaning ‘gift, giving’, sometimes in parallel formations (e.g., VI.53.3 dā́nāya codaya versus VIII.99.4 dānā́ya codáyan), it would not be surprising if the accent had been changed redactionally to match dā́na-, which stem accounts for most of the acc. sg. forms (cf. esp.

dā́nam ínvati I.128.5, dā́nam ínvan V.30.7). As for the sense, although medial forms of √dā are rare outside of the idiom ā́√dā ‘take’, those that occur seem to mean ‘give of oneself / one’s own store’; cf. V.33.9 sahásrā me cyávatāno dádānaḥ “(when) Cyavatāna was giving a thousand of his own to me.” Taking dā́nam as a participle referring to the stingy patron of pāda a allows ná to be a negative and therefore properly positioned.
