Starting with this vs., the pári has no organic connection to the rest of the vs. Here I supply arṣati on the basis of vss. 2-3. So also Re, KH (133).

On viśvádevo ádābhyaḥ as a clever variant on IX.102.5 víśve devā́so ádruhaḥ, see publ. intro.

Ge takes injunc. viśat as model (“… möge sich … niederlassen”), but with Re and KH (133-34) I take it as a general present referring to Soma’s standard ritual action.
