See comment on 12. The thematic connection between the verses is underscored by the presence of the verb ‘grab’ in each, but note that vs. 15, part of the hymn proper, has the older form √grabh (sáṃ gṛbhāya), while the dānastuti, belonging to a more popular level of language, has the younger √grah (-gṛ́hya).
