All standard tr. take hótrā as nom. sg. and the subject of the clause. But since the point of this verse and the last is the labor Agni expends in making the sacrifice succeed, it seems better to keep him as subj. of gachati, as he was of ṛdhnoti (a) and kṛṇoti (b). hótrā can then be an instr. sg. of the ā-stem, as commonly. The ritual model in which Agni goes to the gods with the offering is of course quite widespread in the RV.
