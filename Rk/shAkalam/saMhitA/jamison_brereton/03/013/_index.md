Agni  
R̥ṣabha Vaiśvāmitra  
7 verses: anuṣṭubh  
This is the first hymn of this collection attributed not to Viśvāmitra, but to his son,  R̥ṣabha. Its theme is Agni as the god who inspires the recitations of the priests. As  such, Agni possesses the truth that the hymns express (vs. 2), and he himself is both  an inspired poet (vs. 3) and the Hotar priest (vs. 5). As he is kindled, he becomes  increasingly bright and the hymn connects his visible brilliance with the brilliance  of mind he inspires (vss. 5–6) and finally even the brilliance of the gift he wins for  the sacrificers (vs. 7).
