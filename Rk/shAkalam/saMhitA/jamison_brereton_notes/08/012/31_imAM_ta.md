Pāda c presents some difficulties of interpretation, in particular how to distribute the three accusatives jāmím, padā́, and pípratīm. The last, a participle, takes padám as object in IX.10.7 (adduced by both Old and Ge): padám ékasya píprataḥ “guiding the track of the lone one safely across.” But it also takes personal objects, as in nearby VIII.6.2 prajā́m rtásya p ̥ íprataḥ “guiding the child of truth [=poem] safely across.” I therefore take it as a semantically mixed construction, with jāmím ‘kin’ (which in this case, as in VIII.6.2, would be a poem or hymn) in the frame and ‘footsteps’ in the simile. By contrast, Ge takes jāmím as the subject of the simile, parallel to suṣṭutím: “die wie eine Schwester deine Schritte geleitet.” His interpretation reads better, but ignores the position of iva and also the contrasting constructions of the participle píprat- elsewhere. By my interpretation the point is that the suṣṭutí- produced in ab takes the rest of the verbal portion of the sacrifice along with it to the god.

I take the refrain prā́dhvaré as a (quasi) locative absolute, as in VIII.46.18, rather than as integrated into what precedes.
