The weak pf. form (ā)yejé is anomalous in two regards: it does not agree with the standard weak pf. īj- and it produces a bad cadence here. The form is found twice elsewhere in the RV: āyejé in X.63.7 where Manu is also the subj. and the form is in the same (bad) metrical slot - the two passages seem to be connected - and VI.36.2 with the preverbs ánu prá and in an acceptable metrical slot. The weak pf.

stem īj is not found with preceding preverb. The forms are disc. at length by Kü (391-92) with ample citation of previous lit. Schindler considers īj the older form, to the laryngeal-initial root (PIE*Hia̯ ǵ) with reduplication *Hi-Hij-́ , in contrast to *ia̯ - initial roots, which redupl. *ia̯ -iC. For Schindler the yej forms are metrically driven replacements and serve to avoid the coalescence of the vowel of the preverb + īj, esp.

in the cadence. (Neither he nor Kü seems to recognize that the yej forms produce bad cadences, a problem that undercuts the arguments that both of them use to explain their appearance in this context.) Kü by contrast questions Schindler’s posited distinction in redupl. between initial laryngeal roots *Hia̯ C and glide-initial *ia̯ C, since the development of super-weak forms of the type ūcúr to √vac happens to roots without initial laryngeals, only glides. Kü argues that whether or not the root had a preceding initial laryngeal the redupl. to a *(H)i/̯u̯aC root was originally always

*(H)i/̯ua̯ -. The u/i-type redupl. developed by analogy to *(H)ai/̯uC̯ - roots. Therefore
īj is an inner-Vedic development, not an archaism per Schindler. Yet - even though he thinks yej shows the older reduplication pattern - he still allows the possibility that it’s a new formation nonetheless. Kü’s disc. is ultimately indecisive.

As for the metrical problem, Ludwig and Arnold want to emend to *āyajé, of somewhat dubious morphological provenance. I very tentatively suggest another possibility, that in this preverb-verb combination the underlying form was *ā (H)i(H)ij-ai, with the i-reduplication becoming a glide between ā and the redupl.

syllable, which was then originally short: *āyijé. The drawback to this explanation (or one of them) is that there is no obvious source for the -ej that was substituted at some point in the redaction.
