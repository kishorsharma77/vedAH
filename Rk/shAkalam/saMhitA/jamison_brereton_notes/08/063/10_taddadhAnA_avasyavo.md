Supplying ‘praise-hymn’ or the like as object of dádhānāḥ, which goes back to Sāy, is supported by VII.73.1 práti stómaṃ devayánto dádhānāḥ.

As Ge points out yuṣmā́bhiḥ may refer either to the gods or to the other singers. On the basis of 11, I think the latter is more likely (so also Ge), although note the gods in 12d.
