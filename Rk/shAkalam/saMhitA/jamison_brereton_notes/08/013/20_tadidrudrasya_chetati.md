This verse is quite opaque and its grammar can be construed in a number of different ways, giving the lie to Ge’s breezy “Die Konstruktion ist klar.” See Old’s rather more despairing assessment (“Es ergeben sich mannigfache Möglichkeiten, zwischen denen sichere Entscheidung ausgeschlossen…”).

The first problem is the value of the verb cetati and, when that has been determined, the identity of its subject. Ge takes the verb as intransitive/reflexive “… zeichnet sich … aus,” but an I/T value (‘perceive’) is also possible for this active stem. I interpret it so (as does Old in one of his suggested tr.), and continue as its subject the stotā́of vs. 19.

The next issue is the reference and distribution of tád íd rudrásya … yahvám, which Ge takes as subject of cetati and I as object. I will not rehearse the various suggested possibilities (see Ge and Old), but simply add my own: rudrásya is generally used with 'son(s)' to refer to the Maruts, who can be called 'young' in that context (cf. V.42.15b rudrásya sūnū́m̐r yuvanyū́n...); and a neut. noun regularly used for the Maruts is śárdhas- ‘troop’, as in the nearby hymn VIII.15.9c śárdhaḥ … mā́rutam. In fact see mā́rutaṃ śárdhaḥ in the pāda immediately preceding V.42.15b, namely 15a, where the singular (15a) and plural (15b) expressions are coreferential.

So here I supply that noun with tád … yahvám.

Then what are the “ancient domains”? On the basis of IX.52.2 pratnébhir ádhvabhiḥ “along your age-old routes,” referring to the protocols of the soma sacrifice and the ritual journey of soma, I suggest that the ancient domains here are the age-old practices of the sacrifice. It is essentially equivalent to 14c tántuṃ tanuṣva pūrvyáṃ yáthā vidé “Stretch the ancient thread in the way that is known.” In c I take vícetasaḥ to refer again to the Maruts. For the switch between singular and plural see V.42.15 just cited. The Maruts are called vícetas- in V.54.13.

What the whole verse means and what function it fills in the hymn are not clear to me. If my interpretation of the various parts is correct (and I have no confidence that it is), the successful human praiser of vs. 19 perceives his divine model, the Maruts, whose praise inspired Indra in the Vṛtra battle, at his sacrifice, where they have placed the thought or mental power that he should himself follow.
