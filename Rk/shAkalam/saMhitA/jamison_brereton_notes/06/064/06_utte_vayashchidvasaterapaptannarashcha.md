This vs. is identical to I.124.12.

Pāda b may contain another izafe-like embedded rel. construction, like the possible one in 5c: náraś ca yé pitubhā́jaḥ “and the men who are partakers of food.” The question turns on where to construe hemistich-final vyùṣṭau. It could belong to the rel. cl. “… partake of food at the first flush,” in which case there would be no embedding. But it seems as if this temporal designation should apply to both actions: the flying up of the birds and the eating of the men, not just the latter. Moreover te in 2nd pos. of the hemistich is most easily construed with vyùṣṭau at the end, in which case the nominal rel. must be embedded.

This hemistich also seems syntactically unbalanced. If we assume that we have an “X and which Y” construction, conjoining birds and men (so Klein, DGRV I.56), they should be the joint subject of úd … apaptan ‘have flown up’, an action appropriate to the first group but not the second. Surely the real intent is that at the moment of dawn the birds fly up and the men eat, so what is intended to be conjoined are the two verbal notions, with one a finite verb and the other the 2nd member of a root noun cmpd. (on which see Scar 352).
