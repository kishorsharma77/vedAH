All Gods  
Gaya Plāta  
17 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 16–17  
The signature word of this hymn is svastí “well-being”:  in the dative suvastáye it provides the last four syllables of verses 3–14, and its nominative opens five  consecutive pādas in the verses after that refrain (15–16a). The gods from whom  the poet solicits well-being are primarily the Ādityas and their mother Aditi, who  especially dominate the first half of the hymn. Beginning with verse 9 other gods  are also invoked, though the Ādityas keep their prominence. Not surprisingly in  a hymn devoted to well-being, the emphasis is on positive thoughts, though some  worries about potential dangers do intrude (see vss. 11–12). More surprisingly in  a hymn with such a strong Ādityan cast, our potential moral flaws are barely men  
tioned (vs. 8c).
