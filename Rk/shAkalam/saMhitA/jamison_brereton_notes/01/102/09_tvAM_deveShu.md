The standard tr. take upamanyú- as a PN. Mayrhofer (Personenname) voices skepticism, however, and I see no reason not to take it as an adjective qualifying the bard (kārú-). Though manyú- ‘battle fury’ can be a negative quality, it often is not so viewed (esp. when it belongs to the gods), and the passionate energy it implies would be a good trait for a poet.

The impv. kṛṇotu in d should be read (with the standard tr.) with both c and d, with slightly different values: in c it has a straight “make X Y” sense, while in d it participates in the idiom puráḥ √kṛ ‘make (i.e., put) in front’.
