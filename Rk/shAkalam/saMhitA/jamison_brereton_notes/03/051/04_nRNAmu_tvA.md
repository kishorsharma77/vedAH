Though this vs. begins a new tṛca in a different meter, it partially restores the syntactic structure of vss. 1-2: the first pāda presents Indra in the acc., the second one directs praises to him. Note also that nṛṇā́m … nṛ́tamam picks up náram of 2a.

The structure is somewhat complicated by the fact that both (unnamed) Indra in pāda a and the (unnamed) subjects of the impv. arcatā in b are addressed in the 2nd ps.

This leads both Ge and Re to separate the two pādas: Ge pronounces pāda a an anacoluthon or ellipsis, while Re supplies “(je te chante).” This fastidiouness seems unnecessary to me: the two referents of the 2nd persons are in different grammatical numbers and unlikely to be confused with each other for other reasons, and in a ritual situation both should be present (“at the seat of Vivasvant,” 3c) and could both be directly addressed. The two instrumentals in pāda a (gīrbhír ukthaíḥ) also go better with the verb in b; cf., e.g., VI.22.1 índraṃ táṃ gīrbhír abhy àrca ābhíḥ.

Pāda d consists of two clauses, the nominal námo asya and the short verbèd clause pradíva éka īśe, and so, contra Gr’s suggestion (s.v. īś, col. 236, #8), the verb doesn’t take an acc. here. For supposed exx. of √īś with the acc., see comm. ad VII.32.18.
