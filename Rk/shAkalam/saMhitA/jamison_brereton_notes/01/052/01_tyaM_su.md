The verb mahayā can either be a 2nd sg. imperative (so Ge [/WG]) or a 1st sg.

subjunctive (so Re). In favor of the former interpretation is the parallel initial verse of the last hymn, I.51.1. abhí tyám meṣám ... madatā, with imperative (2nd pl.); in favor of the latter is the other main verb in this verse, 1st sg. opt. vavṛtyām. Either is possible; I weakly favor the 1st ps. subjunctive.

Since subhū́- ‘of good essence’ is adjectival, a noun should be supplied as the subject of pāda b (pace Ge, who simply tr. “Kräfte”). The likely solution is found in vs. 4 subhvàḥ svā́abhíṣtayaḥ “his own superior powers of good essence,” and I have supplied abhíṣtayaḥ here. (So also, it seems, WG.) The standard tr. take cd as a single clause, with the acc. índram of d identified with the rátham of c. Although this is not impossible, turning the literal chariot of a god towards the sacrifice is a common practice in the RV, just as turning the god himself is, and an equation of Indra and the chariot is somewhat awkward. I therefore think we have two separate clauses, with ā́… vavṛtyām applicable to both.

The c pāda has, in my interpretation, a non-insistent but appealing syntactic play, with the compound havana-syád- “rushing to the summons” parallel to the simile átyaṃ ná vā́jam “like a steed (rushing to) the prize” — the suppressed term being a form of the root √syand and the accusative vā́jam matching the first compound member havana-.
