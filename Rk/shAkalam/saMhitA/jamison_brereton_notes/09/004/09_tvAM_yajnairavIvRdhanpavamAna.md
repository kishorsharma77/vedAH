Loc. vídharman lit. ‘in spreading apart / in expansion’ is underspecified and its application unclear -- deliberately so, in my opinion. Once again, the ambiguity allows a blurring of the ritual and the cosmic. In ritual terms the expansion may refer to soma’s spreading across the filter or, as Ge sees it (n. 9b), in the water with which it is mixed; in cosmic terms, it would refer to the spreading of Soma across space (see, e.g., Ober [RR II.152] and VI.71.1 rájaso vídharmaṇi), becoming as extensive as heaven. Re suggests rather that it refers to Soma’s (transitive) spreading (that is, giving) of goods, but I find this less likely. For further disc. see comm. ad IX.64.9.
