The occurrence of 2nd sg. act. pres. impv. píba and aor. impv. pāhi, both to √pā ‘drink’, in a disjunctive vā construction should give us a good opportunity to discern the functional distinction between the imperatives to these two tense-aspect stems, esp. since, as far as I can see, both imperatives would fit either of the metrical slots occupied. I have in fact tr. as if there is a functional difference: ‘drink’ versus ‘take a drink’, but I am not at all convinced that this is correct. Cf. the disc. of the positional tendencies of píba ad III.32.1 and note that the same pāda opening índra píba is found in the next hymn, III.36.2d. However, the same sequence of pres. and aor. to √pā is found in III.36.3, so it may well be meaningful. (The standard tr.

render píba and pāhi identically here.) I take práyatam in c with yajñám in d, contra the standard tr.
