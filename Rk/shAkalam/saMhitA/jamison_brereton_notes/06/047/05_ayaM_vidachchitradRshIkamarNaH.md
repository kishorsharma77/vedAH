HvN divide the 2nd hemistich as … skámbhanenód # di yā́m, with úd the final of pāda a and di yā́m distracted and pāda-initial. But this is clearly wrong: úd is a preverb in tmesis with astabhnāt and should open the pāda, and dyā́m is rarely if ever distracted. Lub’s division is correct.

As noted above, the 2nd hemistich of this vs. sounds esp. Indraic.
