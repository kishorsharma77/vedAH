Since √spṛś does not otherwise occur with ánu in the RV or, per MonierWilliams, in all of Skt., I supply an object with this preposition -- either the flames of pāda a or, perhaps preferably, the prásitim construed with ánu in 1c.

Most interpr. take pataṃgā́n as an unmarked simile, e.g. Ge “(gleich) Vögeln.” My interpr. requires supplying an unparalleled noun but avoids the need for a simile particle.
