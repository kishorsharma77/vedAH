The rendering of goṣu-yúdh- as ‘cattle-raider’ loses the specificity of the loc. pl. 1st member, but ‘of the one battling for cattle’ seemed excessively heavy.

The hapax kṣātí- is built to √kṣā ‘burn’. I have borrowed the felicitous bilingual pun ‘ardor’ from Maurer. On Gotō’s posited √di ‘destroy’ supposedly found in dayate here, see comm. ad III.34.1. There is no need for a separate root, as ‘divides’ à ‘fragments’ is a plausible semantic pathway.
