In the publ. tr. I blindly followed Ge and Re in supplying jyótiṣe ‘light’ with uráve in a. Although this makes fine sense, neither scholar cites parallel passages. It is certainly true that jyótis- is qualified by urú- elsewhere (e.g., I.117.21, II.27.14, VI.3.1) and that jyótiṣmant- is found twice in the next vs. (I.136.3), but I think I would now be inclined to be more circumspect about what uráve refers to.
