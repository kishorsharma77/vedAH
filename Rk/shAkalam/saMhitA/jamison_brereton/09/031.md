Soma Pavamāna
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Another unremarkable gāyatrī hymn. Parallel constructions and phraseol ogy (e.g., the fronted “for you” [túbhyam] in vss. 3, 5, the fronted “be/become”  [bhávā] of vss. 2, 4) give a sense of unity. Unlike many soma hymns, where the  finale delivers the soma to Indra (e.g., the final verses of nearby hymns such as  IX.23.6–7, 26.6, 27.6, 30.6), here it is “we” who declare our desire for his pres ence and partnership (vs. 6).
The poet, Gotama Rāhūgaṇa, is also the composer of a soma hymn in the first  maṇḍala, I.91, and verse 4 in this hymn is identical to I.91.16, which occurs in a  triad of ritually connected verses.
## 1
The self-purifying soma juices have marched forth rich in purpose. They make wealth manifest.
## 2
Become the increaser of brilliance from heaven and from earth, o drop; become the lord of prizes.
## 3
For you rush the favoring winds, for you the rivers.
O Soma, they increase your greatness.
## 4
Swell here, and let bullish power come together for you from all
sides, Soma.
Be at the gathering for the prize.
## 5
For you, o brown one, the cows have yielded imperishable ghee
and milk
upon the highest back.
## 6
You—who have good weapons, who are really present, o lord of
creation—
we want your fellowship, o drop.
