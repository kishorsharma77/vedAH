Soma Pavamāna
Idhmavāha Dārḍhacyuta
6 verses: gāyatrī
Attributed to a descendant of the poet of the previous hymn, based on his patronymic,  this hymn contains nothing novel in terms of content, but it is tightly structured. All verses but the last begin with “that one, him” (tám) referring to the Soma, while the  last begins with a 2nd-person variant on this, “you” (táṃ tvā), literally “that you.”  The last four verses (3–6) all contain a 3rd plural “they impell(ed)” (ahyan, hinvanti built to the same root √hi), and the compounds of 3c and 5c “...to/of many” (bhū́ri)  phonologically echo the word for “arms” (bhuríjor) in the middle verse (4a).
## 1
Him have the inspired poets groomed—the prizewinner in the lap  of Aditi,
through the fine (fleece) and with insight.
## 2
Him have the cows lowed toward, the imperishable one of a thousand  streams,
the drop, supporter of heaven.
## 3
Him, the ritual adept, have they impelled through their wisdom—the one  purifying himself in heaven,
steadfast, giving nurture to many.
## 4
Him have they impelled between the two arms with the insight of  Vivasvant, him who is also clad in it,
the undeceivable lord of speech.
## 5
Him do the siblings [=fingers] impel with the stones on the back (of the  filter)—the tawny one,
delightful, drawing the gaze of many.
## 6
You, self-purifying one, grown strong through song [/on the mountain],  do the ritual adepts impel
as exhilaration for Indra, o drop.
