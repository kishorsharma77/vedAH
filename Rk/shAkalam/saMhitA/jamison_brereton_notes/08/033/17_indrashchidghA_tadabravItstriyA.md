Indra begins, cleverly, with concession: he admits that women’s mental powers are not as strong as they should be. I take this as Indra’s direct speech, even though pāda c is in the accusative (and pāda b could be), since I think such mixed constructions (X said “abc” / said that abc) are found elsewhere. However, little is lost if it is taken as indirect discourse.
