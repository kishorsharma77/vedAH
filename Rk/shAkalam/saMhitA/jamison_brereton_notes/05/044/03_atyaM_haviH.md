Some of the challenges of this vs can be approached by noting the series of phonetic plays it contains: sacate sác ca dhā́tu ca / dhā́tu ca, áriṣṭagātuḥ / sá hótā sahobháriḥ / sahobháriḥ … barhír.

Let us begin with the first. The curious double ca phrase sác ca dhā́tu ca is difficult to render on its own. On the surface it appears to form part of a conjoined NP with the subj. havíḥ ‘oblation’, but its ill-assorted nature comes out in tr. like Ge’s “die Opferspende und das Seiende und das Element (?).” Moreover, though dhā́tu- does not otherwise occur uncompounded in the RV, after the RV it is masc., while this form must be neut, which would be anomalous if it is a noun here. Ge suggests (n. 3a) emending to the bahuvrīhi saptádhātu ‘having 7 parts’ (RV 3x), though this is not reflected in his tr. As a bv the neut. gender would be proper, as a modifier of havís-. Re suggests rather that sác ca dhā́tu “resolves” an old cmpd.

*sad-dhā́tu, tr. “et (sa) foundation est réelle.” I am in accord with his rendering but
analyze the underlying form differently: I take sác ca as a play on MIA sacca-, the Middle Indic product of satyá-. (That Middle Indic phonological developments are already to be found even in the RV family books needs no further demonstration.) The whole sequence gestures towards a bahuvrīhi *sacca-dhātu-, whose neut. gender would be appropriate. Note that very similar satyá-dharman- (RV 5x) is found at
