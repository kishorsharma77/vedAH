Both this verse and the next seem to rest on the unexpressed presupposition that on our own we have a pretty poor impression of ourselves, but if Indra will pay attention to us, we'll feel good about ourselves again. (Early lessons in self-esteem!) It may be that the curious verse 12 that immediately precedes sets the stage for these verses by depicting Indra as one who can set everything to rights. See esp. the last pāda of 12.

On duróṣa- see EWA s.v. This rare and unclear word, appearing 3x in the RV (IV.21.6 and IX.101.3 as well as here), must be compared with similarly unclear Aves. dūraoša-, a standing epithet of Haoma in the Hom Yašt and also once in the Gāthās (Y 32.14). In the RV it modifies Soma only in IX.101.3; here it qualifies “us” and in IV.21.6 the Hotar, most likely Agni. The Avestan word has been variously interpr. - but no more convincingly than its RVic counterpart. The tr. adopted here, ‘difficult to burn’, makes a connection with the Aves. forms more difficult because dus- ‘bad, ill’ should not appear with -r in sandhi (see disc. in EWA), though Humbach et al. (n. ad Y 32.14) upholds this analysis. This rendering is not altogether a good fit in any of the RVic passages; nonetheless, the alternatives seem worse. In tr.

it so, I’m assuming a Vedic-internal folk etymology from an opaque inherited word; the tr. therefore has no implications for the meaning of the Avestan word or for IIr.

etymology. Sāy’s interpr. of the word in two of the three passages falls squarely in this realm: VIII.1.13 oṣitum anyair dagdham aśaktyā(ḥ), IX.101.3 … durdahaṃ durvadhaṃ vā
