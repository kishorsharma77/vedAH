(prá) yakṣi is morphologically ambiguous -- 2nd sg. act. -si impv. or 1st sg.

middle s-aor. -- and opinion is divided: Old (ZDMG 55.314, Noten) dithers and doesn’t ultimately decide; Ge, Narten (Sig.Aor. 200-201), and Klein (DGRV I.385) opt for the 1st sg., Re for the 2nd but to the root √yakṣ. A strong factor in favor of a 2nd sg. to √yaj is the presence of an undoubted form of this same -si impv. in the following vs. (9c; cf. also 2c); in favor of a non-2nd-sg. interpr. is the difficulty of construing pāda-initial táva with such an impv. I consider the form the 2nd sg. act. to √yaj, on the basis not only of 9c but also vs. 13 in the previous hymn (VI.15), where Agni is the subj. of a (pres.) impv. to prá √yaj: VI.15.13d yájiṣṭḥaḥ sá prá yajatām ṛtā́vā “let him, the best sacrificer, the truthful one, set the sacrifice in motion.” What then to do with the rest of the first two pādas? I accept Ludwig’s suggestion (registered by Old) that prá yakṣi is a parenthesis -- or rather, I think that, because of the rigid parallel patterning in this tṛca, táva, which belongs with the clause beginning saṃdṛ́śam, has been fronted around the peremptory impv. prá yakṣi, and that it is dependent on the NP saṃdṛ́śam utá krátum: “your manifestation and resolve do they take pleasure in.” This is, strictly speaking, ungrammatical, but rhetoric occasionally trumps syntax.
