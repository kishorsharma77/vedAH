The Inhaltsakk. with pári … kṣárā are disharmonious in formation, with the sg.

noun áśvam (rendered in the publ. tr. as the mass noun ‘horseflesh’, perhaps a bit too vividly) in pāda a followed by two possessive adj. gómat and híraṇyavat ‘possessing / consisting of cattle (and) gold’ in pāda b, followed by a pl. NP sahasríṇīr íṣaḥ ‘thousandfold refreshments’ in c. In a we might have expected áśvāvat ‘possessing / consisting of horses’, to match the adjectival forms in b, but the phonologically similar and adjacent aśvavíd ‘horse-finding’ may have blocked it (to avoid *áśvāvad aśvavíd [though some RVic poets would have loved that phrase]).
