Soma
Krtnu Bh ̥ ārgava
9 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 9, probably arranged in trcas ̥
One of the rare hymns to Soma outside of the IXth Maṇḍala. None of the physical  or ceremonial properties of soma the substance, the ritual drink, is found in this  hymn. There is only indirect reference to the preparation of soma, in verse 3, where  the “body-makers,” presumably the priests who prepare the soma, are given shelter  from hatred, and in verse 4 soma is called “possessor of the silvery (drink) [that is,  soma itself],” an epithet otherwise almost exclusively used of Indra.
Instead of the ritual soma, we have here a portrait of an all-powerful and multi talented divine helper: a winner (vs. 1), a poet (vs. 1), a healer (vs. 2), a giver (vs. 5),  a finder of lost objects (vs. 6), and especially a protector from hostility (vss. 3, 4, 9).  Only in verse 8 is there any hint that Soma might ever be anything but benevolent  to us, but this hint is not developed.
