As often, a pattern imposed earlier in the hymn is partly altered at the end.

In this case the vs.-initial voc. sómārudrau of 1-3 is postponed till the beginning of the 2nd pāda.

The simplicity and banality of this hymn (and perhaps an eye to the finish line) seem to have led both Ge and Re into uncharacteristic (and independent) lapses: Ge tr. ab in the 3rd ps., despite the clear voc. sómārudrau and clear 2nd du. impv.

mṛḷatam; Re twists (at considerable verbal expense and with a characteristic parenthesis) the du. sumanasyámānā ending the vs. as an acc. pl. modifying naḥ: “protégez nous (en sorte que nous ayons) l’esprit bien disposé.”
