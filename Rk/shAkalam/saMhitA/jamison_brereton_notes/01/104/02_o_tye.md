Unlike the standard tr. I take the two acc. plurals in b, tā́n … ádhvanaḥ, separately, with the first referring to the ‘men’ (náraḥ) of pāda a. One might object that since they “have come” (guḥ) to him in that pāda, he has no need to go to them in the next, but, at least in English, “go to for help” is tantamount to “ask for help” and need not involve any actual travel on the part of the men. And in any case he would need to join them at the place of battle. I.71.9, which contains the phrase ádhvanaḥ sadhá éti without tā́n, may support me.

For the pf. opt. jagamyāt, see Jamison 2009 (East and West); as exhaustively demonstrated there, the pf. opt. has no special “perfect” value and here means simply “should go.” The publ. tr. reflects the emendation of ścamnan to *śamnan, suggested by Gr and argued for in Jamison 1983: 103 n. 62. I am now less certain about this emendation than I was then, being more sympathetic to Old’s questioning how this corruption could have arisen. On the other hand, the Aves. gerundive scąϑβa- (V.13.40), adduced by Ge as a cognate to a supposed root √ścam, provides no support for a separate etymon of this shape, since it is, with Insler, better attributed to the root *skand ‘break’, well attested in Avestan and elsewhere in Iranian. For details see Jamison 1983 loc. cit.
