The placement of utá in b is unexpected: it should not break up the NP víśvāḥ … kṣitáyaḥ, which it is conjoining to the two nominal expressions in pāda a.

We would expect #*utá viśvāḥ kṣitáyaḥ. Perhaps the metrically distasteful initial two light syllables prompted a flip. Klein (DGRV I.330-31) does not discuss this placement in his treatment of the passage.

Pāda c ásat ta útso gṛṇaté niyútvān is somewhat puzzling, at least on the literal level: “your wellspring will be possessed of a team for the singer.” Ge’s rendering, “Dein Quell sei freigebig …,” is overly free, but it probably captures the sense fairly closely. The semantic pathway is clearer in Re’s “Que ta source … procure un attelage (de biens).” Cf. III.49.4 … vásubhir niyútvān “teamed with goods.” Perhaps the tr. should be altered to “will provide teams (of goods) …” Although niyútvant- is also found in the preceding hymn (IX.88.2), its use there seems unconnected with this one.
