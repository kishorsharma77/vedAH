Indra aided the Ārya sacrificer in battles, affording a hundred forms of  help in all contests—in contests whose prize is the sun.

Chastising those who follow no commandment, he made the black skin  [=barbarians] subject to Manu.
As a burning (fire) scorches everything dried up, he scorches the
thirsty—scorches Arśaśāna down to the ground.
