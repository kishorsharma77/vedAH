The construction of the second hemistich is not entirely clear. Most tr. take barháṇā kṛtáḥ together (e.g., Re “créé par une pression-violente”), but this requires supplying a verb with the first part of pāda d (e.g., Re “(s’est mis)”). I instead think the idiom is puráḥ √kṛ ‘put in front’ (I.102.9, VIII.45.9, X.171.4, of which the first two have ‘chariot’ as obj. - e.g., VIII.45.9 rátham puráḥ … kṛṇotu). I do not take háribhyām as an ablative, because 1) puráḥ + ABL is only dubiously attested, and 2) setting Indra-as-chariot in front of his horses would be literally putting the cart before the horse. I take háribhyām as dative, and think the idea is that Indra/the chariot is set out front for the horses, that is, for them to be hitched up.

Ge and Re take vṛṣabháḥ with rátho hí ṣáḥ, but this is basically impossible, given the position of the hí, which overwhelmingly takes 2nd position. Nonetheless I agree that Indra is being identified with the chariot (not, however, with Ge the chariot(-fighter)); WG supply “word” as the referent of sáḥ, but the striking equation of Indra and chariot better fits the extravagance of the praise of Indra.
