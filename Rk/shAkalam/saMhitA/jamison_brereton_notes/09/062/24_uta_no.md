For some disc. of this passage see Scar 641 with n. 906. He gives pariṣṭúbh- an active value (“ringsum jubelnd, rauschend”) in this passage: “… zu allen, die ringsum Töne von sich geben,” in contrast to my passive “encircled with rhythm,” which follows Re’s “environnées de rhythmes.” Since the cmpd modifies íṣaḥ ‘refreshments’, it is hard to see how they could actively produce noise, though Scar (n. 906) suggests it might refer to the cows likewise characterizing the refreshments (gómatīr íṣaḥ), in the form of bellowing milk streams. This seems a bit farfetched, though it does allow the form to be semantically united with its other occurrence, in I.166.11, where it modifies the Maruts, who are actively making noise. For the idiom see I.80.9 pári ṣṭobhata “encircle (him) with rhythm!” where it is parallel to arcata “chant!” See also nearby IX.64.28 pariṣṭóbhant-. Ge takes pariṣṭubhaḥ as a noun ‘lauter Loblieder’, also with active sense.
