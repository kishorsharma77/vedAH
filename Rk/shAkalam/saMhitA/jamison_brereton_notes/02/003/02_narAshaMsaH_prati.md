Pāda a is supposed to contain a lexeme práti √añj governing dhā́māni, but this would be the only ex. of the verbal idiom in the RV. I therefore take práti as governing dhā́māni ‘foundations’, in a parallel expression to tisró dívaḥ práti in b. I supply “of the earth” with dhā́māni on the basis of I.22.16 dhā́mabhiḥ pr̥thivyā́ḥ. The participle añján would be used absolutely and anticipate sám anaktu in d. The early part of the hymn has a tendency to station present participles at pāda ends, and not always with obj. (1d árhan, our 2a, 2c undán, 3a árhan).
