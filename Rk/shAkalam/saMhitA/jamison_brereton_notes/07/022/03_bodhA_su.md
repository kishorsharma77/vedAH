The position of ā́in the middle of the NP vā́cam … imā́m is worth noting.

Gr takes it as a preverb with bódhā, but √budh does not otherwise occur with ā́, and its position would not be normal for a preverb in tmesis. Note also that bódhā + SPEECH is found in the next vs. (bódhā … manīṣā́m) and in the preceding hymn (VII.21.1d bódhā … stómam), both times without preverb. I am tempted to assume that the poet inserted an unnecessary adverbial ā́‘here’ to produce a proper cadence.

Pāda-final vā́cam émā́m is also found in IX.97.13, a verse attributed to Upamanyu Vāsiṣṭha, again without obvious function.
