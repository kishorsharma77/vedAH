The standard interpr. take bhū́rṇayaḥ with the frame (Ge “diese eifrigen Herren”), but its position at the end of the verse, far from its supposed NP, leads me to put it in the simile. (Sim. Re.) Passages like IX.17.1 … iva síndhavo, ghnánto vṛtrā́ṇi bhū́rṇayaḥ “like turbulent rivers … smashing obstacles” give support to this assignment. The simile then consists of a nom. + acc. matching those of the frame. It might be objected that rivers don’t strike against their own surge, but the image may be of fast water catching up with itself and overtopping a wave.
