The “drink!” sequence is brought to an end with a summary evā́in 3a. The verse continues with a series of 7 choppy imperatival clauses, all but the first (mándatu tvā) with Indra as subj., which balance the choppy nominal relative clauses of vs. 2. The last of these clauses is the third iteration of abhí √tṛd, with which we began.
