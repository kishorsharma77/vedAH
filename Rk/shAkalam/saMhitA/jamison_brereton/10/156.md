Agni
Ketu Āgneya
5 verses: gāyatrī
The ritual setting for this hymn is given in verses 4–5: the kindling of fire at sunrise.  The first three verses express the hope that this kindling of the fire will bring goods  to the ritual participants, an oblique reference to the distribution of the priestly  gifts at the Morning Pressing. This blatant desire for reward is somewhat camou
flaged by couching it in terms of contests (vs. 1), cattle raids (vs. 2), and chariot  racing (vs. 3).
## 1
Let our thoughts spur Agni on, like a swift span in the contests;
with him might we win prize after prize.
## 2
The weapon with which we will make the cows our own by your help,  o Agni,
spur that on—to give us bounties.

## 3
Agni, bring here brawny wealth, broad and rich in cows and horses. Lubricate the wheel-nave, make the niggard roll.
## 4
Agni, you make the unaging heavenly body, the sun, mount in heaven, as you establish light for the peoples.
## 5
Agni, you are the beacon of the clans, dearest, fairest lap-child.
Awaken, as you establish vitality for your praiser.
