The referent of the yád’s in ab is not overtly expressed. Ge supplies ‘Heilmittel’ on the basis of vs. 15 with bheṣajám. That verse does not seem to me particularly apposite. Nonetheless, I follow him, because the denom. bhaiṣajyá- is found in the next vs. (6b), because bheṣajá- is elsewhere found in the waters (cf. I.23.19), and because plants are generally associated with healing (see X.97).

kṛtám can be either a neut. sg. ppl., agreeing with yád, or a root aor. 2nd du. act.

injunc. Gr and Ge take it as the former; Old considers the latter, but rejects it on what seem to me slight grounds. I take it as the latter, in part because the immediately preceding hymn contains 2 of the 7 (per Lub; 8 if this is counted) examples of accented finite 2nd du. kṛtám (VIII.8.13, 17) and also because I think it more likely that the Aśvins would be portrayed as actively producing these remedies (see 6b) than that the remedies simply got made. However, the ppl. interpr. is far from excluded.
