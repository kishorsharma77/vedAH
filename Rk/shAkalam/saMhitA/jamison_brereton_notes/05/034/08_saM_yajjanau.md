The identity of the verb ávet in b is disputed. Gr takes it as an opt. to √av ‘help’; Old rejects that analysis but suggests that either √vid ‘know’ or √vī ‘pursue’ is possible. Ge and WG (see also Oberlies RdV I.535) opt for √vid and take the rest of the ab as indirect discourse controlled by this verb (“when he found out that …”).

This is possible, but I find it hard to integrate subordinate yád clause in ab (with plupf.) with the hí cl. of c (with root aor.) and the main cl. of d (with pres. indic.). I find that the sequence of tense works better if ab is a separate unit, with subord. yád cl. in a and main clause in b (ávet accented because pāda-initial). Then c is the causal grounds for the main cl. in d and expresses immed. past.

My analysis requires supplying a verb in pāda a, linked to the preverb sám (which by the other interpr. must be construed with √vid, a combination not found with ‘know’, though it is with √vid ‘find’). A good candidate for a verb to supply is given by sámṛti- ‘clash’ in 6a, and verbal forms to this idiom (sám √ṛ) are fairly common. Cf. VII.25.1 … yát samáranta sénāḥ “when armies clash together.” My analysis also depends on a different analysis of ávet, which I assign to √vī ‘pursue’.

Note véti opening 4c.

The def. anyám ‘the one’ in c, referring to one of the two opponents in ab, more or less demands a responsive ‘the other’, as Ge and I supply in d.

Old questions the existence of the stem pravepanín-, suggesting that pravepanī́is an adverbial instr. to a pravepanī́- (fld. by WG). I don’t see that a stem pravepanī́- is appreciably better than an -ín-stem and follow the older analysis.
