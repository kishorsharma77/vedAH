With Sāy., Ge, Old (SBE), etc., I take jányeva as representing janya(ḥ) iva, with double application of sandhi, against the Pp. jányā. There are various different interpr. of the sociological situation represented by jányeva mítryaḥ; mine is closest to Old (SBE). See disc. in my 2001 Fs. Parpola article.
