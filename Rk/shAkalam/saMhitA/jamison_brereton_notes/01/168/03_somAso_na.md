ihéva śrṇ̥ va eṣāṃ, káśā hásteṣu …, the Maruts do have a whip, so an alternative tr. could be “spur them on with your own breath as whip” or “spur them on by yourselves with a whip.” The use of tmánā with a clearly marked simile in 5b may lend support to my interpr. of káśayā as an unmarked simile here.

The qualifier “dustless” (aréṇavaḥ), in combination with codata ‘spur on’ (b) and acucyavuḥ ‘have made stir’ (c), evokes the common notion that dust gets stirred up by violent activity (see, e.g., I.56.4=IV.17.13, IV.42.5). It is thus a paradox: although the Maruts set many things in motion, they themselves remain unaffected by this movement and therefore dustless.
