For my general interpr. of this verse see publ. intro. I will not discuss the various other interpretations in detail here or repeat what I said in the intro. I will point out that most tr. take the subject of both a and b to be the Śiphā river in 4, but this assumes that a and b are essentially repetitions of each other, which would constitute an unartful duplication in a very artful hymn. Since pādas cd contain dual feminines, it makes more sense to take ab as an implicit “the one … the other” construction, with the two subjects the same as the duals in cd. One problem with this interpr. is that the verb áva … bharate in pāda a lacks an overt object; I suggest in the intro. that it might be defilement or pollution that is also removed ritually by the avabhṛthá bath at the end of the classic Vedic sacrifice.

In d we find a periphrastic passive construction: haté … syātām “may the two be smashed.” Though this periphrasis is somewhat unusual, even a stray thought of what the 3rd du. middle opt. of the passive of √han would be (*hanyeyātām) may explain the substitution. According to Macdonell (VG), such forms are not attested in Vedic.
