The most natural reading of yáthā in c is as a subordinator in a purpose clause (‘so that’) with the subjunctive ā́vahātaḥ in d, and this is how the standard tr.

take it. But there is a major stumbling block: the verb is unaccented. Old seems willing to emend to an accented verb; Ge suggests that if the unaccented verb is bothersome, assume an ellipsis in c. I have, in somewhat ad hoc fashion, taken yáthā as a sort of simile marker with dravát. I am not entirely satisfied with this solution, but it does more or less fit category 4) in Gr’s lemma yáthā, and I am quite reluctant to put an unaccented verb into a subordinate clause. A similar phrase in the next hymn, where yáthā marks a localized comparison, gives support to the interpr. here; see III.36.6 prasaváṇ yáthā “like a shot” (tr. similarly by all standard tr.).
