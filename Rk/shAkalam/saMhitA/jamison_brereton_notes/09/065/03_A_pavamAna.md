Both Ge and Re take devébhyaḥ as dat. with dúvaḥ: “Eifer für die Götter,” “l’hommage aux dieux,” whereas in the publ. tr. I take it as an abl., “friendship from the gods.” The issue is the multivalence of dúvas- and its derivatives; in the meaning ‘friendship’ it generally refers to the mutually agreeable relationship between men and gods.

In this context it seemed to me odd to order Soma to “bring [us] through purification” friendship for the gods, hence my ablatival interpr. However, a more detailed examination of the usage of dúvas- and the denom. duvasyá- shows that the offering / seeking of dúvasgenerally goes from men to gods (or Agni, as the god closest to men, to gods). E.g., devéṣu kṛṇuto dúvaḥ “The two [= married couple] do friendly service to the gods”; III.3.1 agnír hí devā́m̐amṛ́to duvasyati “For Agni the immortal does friendly service to / befriends the gods.” I therefore would emend the tr. to datival “bring … friendship for the gods.” Like the parallel obj. suṣṭutím ‘good praise’, dúvas- is then something that we mortals offer to the gods, but, though it originates from us, it is Soma who stimulates our production of these offerings, hence ā́… pavasva “bring by purifying yourself.”
