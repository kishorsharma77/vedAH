Maruts (1–2) and Indra and the Maruts (3–6)
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
For this hymn see the introduction to I.165. In this episode Agastya pleads with  the Maruts to reconcile themselves with Indra and with him. He first addresses the  Maruts (1–4) and then turns to Indra himself (5–6). In verse 4 Agastya explains  to the Maruts that Indra terrified him and although the offerings were prepared  for them, Agastya was forced to give them away to Indra. Then he addresses Indra  and asks that Indra together with the Maruts prosper the “sons of Māna.” Māna  is Agastya’s father, and therefore Agastya is seeking prosperity for his extended  family. In verse 6 he pleads with the god not to attack the Maruts, who are his own  men (6a), for ultimately Indra will be even greater because of his alliance with the  Maruts (6cd).
In 5a usrā́ḥ “ruddy” primarily describes the dawns, but it could also modify the  “sons of Māna.” This ambiguity associates the luster of the dawns with the luster  that Agastya wishes for his family. The ruddy color of the dawns is also the charac teristic color of cattle and further suggests that the luster of the sons of Māna will  be based in their wealth of cattle.
