vayúnā kṛṇoti reprises ákran … vayúnāni in 2c.

chándaḥ is somewhat problematic. Gr takes it as a masc. nom. sg. to a them.

adj. chánda-, with the developed sense “der Gefallende, Schmeichler oder Buhle,” and this tack is followed by the standard tr. (incl. the publ. one). But the only other supposed occurrence of this stem, in VIII.7.36, I take to the much better established s-stem neut. chándas- ‘metrical vs.’. However, that solution is not available here, at least as far as I can see, and so I reluctantly follow the standard solution, without much faith in its correctness. It does not help this interpr. that Dawn is being compared to a masc. being, esp. since smiling is almost always a feminine action.

Redupl. ajīgaḥ must be a transitive redupl. aor. beside jā̆rayati ‘causes to awaken’. Cf. I.113.4-6: uṣā́ajīgar bhúvanāni víśvā. I supply ‘us’ as obj. here, on the basis of the 1st pl. subj. in pāda a.
