Schaefer (196-97) nicely points out that the “intensive” (i.e., frequentative) soṣavīti is the verbal equivalent of the āmreḍitas in 6cd (see comm. above) with the simple verb suva.

I am not certain what to do with pāda b. The standard tr. take Mitra-Varuṇa as parallel subjects with those in c, with the main verb in d. This is certainly possible, but conceptually it seems a bit odd. Do Mitra and Varuṇa want things from other gods? would they beg for such a gift? Also Savitar is regularly híraṇyapāṇi- (as in III.54.11), so the -pāṇi- adj. here (supāṇī́) would associate M+V with him.
