This is the last of the vss. repeated in the Aśvamedha sections of the YV.

pári is the signature word of this vs.: páry eti (a), paribā́dhamānaḥ (b), pári pātu (d).

On the cmpd hasta-ghná- see Old and Lü (ZDMG 96: 39), the latter summarized by Re (EVP).

There are numerous diff. interpr. of vayúnāni here. I assume that it refers to the different possible trajectories of the bowstring when it is released.

The last pāda may emphasize the masculinity of the handguard and the archer because the bowstring, from which the handguard protects the archer, is feminine.
