The sense of mā́na- here is disputed. Ge takes it as “Melodie,” explained ad I.39.1 as via “Tonbemessen, Intonation”; Old “Himmelshaus.” Although my interpretation of mā́na- as ‘measure’ shares a root etymology with Ge’s (at least as he sees it, but cf. EWA s.vv. mā́na2 , mā́na3 ), namely √mā ‘measure’, I take it in a fairly literal sense — the measure of heaven is the distance to it — and as an acc. of goal. See also 7d.

As far as I can see, úd √sad occurs only here in the RV. Ge takes it as “make a pause,” but gives no grounds for this interpretation. Although already in the BYV Saṃhitās this lexeme can mean ‘go out, (tr.) put out [of fire]’, here a literal meaning ‘sit up’ fits the context very well. The pressing stones are raised up in preparation for pressing; note that the grā́van-, also ‘pressing stone’, are ūrdhvá- ‘erect’ in X.92.15, a situation also embodied in the compound ūrdhvá-grāvan-.
