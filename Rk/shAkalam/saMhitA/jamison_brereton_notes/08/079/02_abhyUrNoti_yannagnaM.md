In c īm seems functionless. Though technically it could serve as object to prá … khyat (“the blind man sees it/them”), it is much more likely that the verb is used in absolute function, to indicate the blind man’s recovery of his vision, not his sight of some particular (but unspecified) object(s). Vs. 6c also begins prém a-VOWEL, though there the īm could double the object ā́yuḥ. However, in both cases I think īm is simply introduced to avoid hiatus.
