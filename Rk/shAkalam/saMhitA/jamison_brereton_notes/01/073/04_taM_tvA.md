As noted at I.72.10 our c is almost identical to pāda a there. The publ. tr.

treats the first as a Tānunāptra passage (“deposited their own śrī́”) but not this one, and the two should probably be brought into harmony. I now favor taking neither one as a Tānunāptra expression, but see disc. ad I.72.10. In this case the deposit of ‘heavenly brilliance’ (dyumná-) may be what allows Agni to become the foundation of riches.
