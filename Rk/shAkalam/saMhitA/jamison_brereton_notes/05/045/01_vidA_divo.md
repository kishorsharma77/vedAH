The Pp. interprets vidā́as vidā́ḥ, and this interpr. is followed by Sāy., Gr, Ge, Re (EVP XVI.107), and WG inter alia. It has the merit of providing a verb form for the opening pāda, but the 2nd sg. subjunctive it appears to be does not fit well in context. I prefer to take it as instr. sg. of the root noun víd- (vidā́against the Pp.), as tentatively suggested by Old and, in different ways, adopted by Lüders (Varuṇa 325), Thieme (rev. of Lüders, ZDMG 101 (1951) 417 [=KlSch 652]), Schmidt (B+I 175- 76), and Hoffmann (Inj. 173-74). My interp. follows Hoffmann in particular in taking pāda b as parenthetical, with the singular verb appropriate to pāda a postponed until ápāvṛta in pāda c. I far prefer this solution to allowing the sg. part. viṣiyán in pāda a to be construed with the pl. phrase arcíno guḥ in b, with Lü et al. The sg. subj.

of a,c is most likely the sun.

In b arcín- is interpr. either as ‘having chant, singing’ (by most) or ‘having rays, bright’. Again with Hoffmann, I prefer the latter. Hoffmann (174 n. 125) suggests supplying ketú- ‘beam’, regularly associated with the dawns, and this seems contextually appropriate.

Pāda c contains another -ín-stem, this time a hapax, vrajín- ‘possessing enclosures’, in the fem. acc. pl.. Gr, Ge, Hoffmann, and WG take the referent to be ‘cows’, but the usual obj. of ápa √vṛ is the cow-enclosure (often the base of vrajín-, namely vrajá-) or the doors thereto, and ‘door’ is also fem. This noun, dúraḥ, is found in the next pāda as the obj. of the nearly identical lexeme ví … āvaḥ. In taking ‘doors’ as obj. also of ápāvṛta I am in agreement with Lü, Thieme, and Schmidt.

With Hoffmann and against the Pp. I take ápāvṛta as an injunc. ápā + vṛta.

The verb of d, ví … āvaḥ, is undeniably augmented, however; I take it as a summary comment on the description found in the rest of the vs. See Hoffmann’s disc. 174-75.
