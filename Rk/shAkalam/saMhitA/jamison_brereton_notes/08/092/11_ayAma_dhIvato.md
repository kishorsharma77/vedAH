Old and Ge take áyāma as expletive “let’s go!” and construe the rest of the verse with jáyema in c (“might we conquer the poems of the poet …”). Although this is possible, it requires the poet (dhī́vant-) in question to be a rival poet (so explicitly Old), and I wonder if we would flatteringly refer to a rival poet as “visionary.” I think rather that we are appropriating the visionary thoughts of our own poet and configuring them as steeds for vicotry in battle. For dhī́- = árvant- cf. VI.45.12 dhībhír árvadbhiḥ ... jeṣma “With visionary thoughts as our steeds might we conquer …” Construing áyāma with acc. of goal is very similar to áganma … āśásaḥ “we have arrived at our hopes” in 13c.
