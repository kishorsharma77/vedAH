The curious term svádhainava- appears to mean ‘having its own milk/milk-cows’, with vṛddhi of dhenú- (see AiG II.2.114). It echoes svadhā́ánu in 19a, and, as often, this echo may help account for its deployment here. Its referent is presumably soma-pressings or soma-drinks.

The relation between pāda a and the relative clauses of bc is, at best, “improper.” That is, the two singular forms yáḥ in b and c must have as their (rough) antecedent the gen. plural of pāda a referring to the pressings/drinks.
