The standard tr. take arṇavám as an unmarked simile, serving as goal to the verb in b: “my songs go to Indra, as if to the sea [Ge “(wie) zu dem Meere,” Re “(tel) un océan,” WG more accurately but less persuasively “(wie) zu wallender Flut”].

The word is therefore only indirectly associated with Indra: they are both goals but need have nothing else in common. But given the parallelism in structure of vss. 1 and 2, I am reluctant to break the pattern of accusatives characterizing Indra by introducing this syntactic disjunction, and further the simile only makes good sense if arṇavá- really is a sea or the like, not an undulating flood. I think instead that Indra is directly described as a flood, the flood itself being characterized as śākín- ‘possessing powers’.

The water-crossing mentioned here may simply be a reference to Indra’s general leadership in crossing rivers and gaining new territory, but it may more specifically point to the famous crossing of King Sudās dramatized in III.33 and referred to again in III.53.9, even though the poet Viśvāmitra, not Indra, is the major actor there. The crossing is mentioned again in 9a.
