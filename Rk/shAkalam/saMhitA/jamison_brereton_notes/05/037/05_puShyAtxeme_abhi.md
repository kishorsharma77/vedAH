The pāda-framing #kṣéti … púṣyan# of 4d recur adjacent at the beginning of 5a #púṣyāt kṣéme in different morphological form; kṣéme ‘peace(ful dwelling) is also paired with its opposite yóga- ‘hitching up, war’, with two contrastive clauses framed by the subjunctives #puṣyāt … bhavāti# predicting success in both peace and war.

The war theme is further developed in the following pāda. I take ubhé vṛ́tau saṃyatī́as an implicitly subordinated clause with pres. part. as main verb (an interpr.

that WG come close to as an alternative considered in their n.). It would be possible to take this phrase as acc. obj. of sáṃ jayāti (so Ge, WG, Oberlies [Relig. RV II.172]), but it doesn’t make sense that the king would conquer both clashing forces, when one of them is likely his own. Rather I think the point is that Indra will favor him over the opponent and therefore his side will prevail. See V.34.8, where Indra links himself to one of two opposing troops and helps his clients win.
