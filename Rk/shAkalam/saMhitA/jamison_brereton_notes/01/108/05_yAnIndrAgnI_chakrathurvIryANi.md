I read cakrathuḥ of a also with b, though in a different sense. Ideally for this sense (‘assumed, made your own’) the verb of b would have been med. cakrāthe.

The referents of tébhiḥ in d are syntactically the neut. yā́(ni) phrases in abc, but it doesn’t make much sense to “drink with” those particular referents. It would be possible to tr. tébhiḥ more heavily as “because of these” or the like, but I think the answer is simpler: rhetorical patterning trumps semantics. The poet is leading up to the loosely attached refrain of vss. 6-12, whose last pāda is identical to 5d but with áthā rather than tébhiḥ; the tébhiḥ here serves as a transition between the earlier verses, where the d pāda is integrated into the verse and the refrain-marked verses to come. It is grammatically connected to but semantically estranged from the first three pādas of 5.
