Priests  
Budha Saumya  
12 verses: triṣṭubh, except gāyatrī 4–6, br̥hatī 5, jagatī 9, 12  
Addressed to the priests of the soma sacrifice, this charming hymn first likens their  ritual activities to various kinds of manual labor, especially farm labor (vss. 3–4).  The preparation of soma is then compared to raising water from a well (vss. 5–7)  for livestock. The preparation of the soma advances through a series of changing  images (vss. 8–10), ending with a surprisingly eroticized pair of verses (11–12).
