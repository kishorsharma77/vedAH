Ge (/WG) take the deaf ears to be those of Āyu -- with Āyu referring to the Ārya in general, WG suggest. Āyu always poses difficulties, but in this case I think gen. āyóḥ should be construed with ślókaḥ: the “signal call of Āyu,” referring to Agni and the sound of blazing fire. Elsewhere Agni is referred to as the “laud of Āyu” (śáṃsa- āyóḥ, IV.6.11, V.3.4), and this seems a similar expression referring to an audible product. The nom. participles budhānáḥ śucámānaḥ ‘awakening, blazing’ of course fit Agni very well. And it is not surprising, given his ritual role, that the sound of Agni should be considered to be identical to that of truth. As for the position of āyóḥ, at some distance from ślókaḥ, note that it rhymes with ā́góḥ in 6d, likewise stationed at the end of the verse.
