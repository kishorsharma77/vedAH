As noted just above, I take the relative clauses in ab as hanging off 26c.

Both Ge and Old make 27bc into a single clause, but the verb in c (nīnamaḥ) is unaccented although b begins with a relative pronoun yáḥ. I therefore take ab as being two parallel relative clauses sharing a single verb mucát; cleverly the poet has exploited the fact that √muc participates in two different syntactic constructions with accusative and ablative: “release ROPE vel sim. [acc.] from VICTIM [abl.]” and “release VICTIM [acc.] from ROPE [abl.].” (Perhaps not surprisingly, English has the same two constructions.) In 27a we find the first, though without overt expression of the VICTIM (=us or perhaps the Ārya); cf., e.g., X.97.15 tā́no muñcantu áṃhasaḥ. In b we find the second, though without overt expression of the ROPE. Here I supply áṃhaḥ adapted from abl. áṃhasaḥ in pāda a. Cf. IV.12.6=X.126.8 evó ṣv àsmán [i.e., asmát] muñcata vy áṃhaḥ.
