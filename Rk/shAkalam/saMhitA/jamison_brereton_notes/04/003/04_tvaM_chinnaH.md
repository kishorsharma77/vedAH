My “at least” for cid follows Ge (“wenigstens”). This somewhat testy note seems to introduce the next part of the hymn, with its anxious or annoyed questions to Agni about his relationship to the sacrificers and how he will represent it to the other gods.

The śámī- and the ṛtá- here presumably refer to the complementary physical and verbal aspects of the sacrifice. On ṛtá- as “Kultlied” in this and similar passages, see Lü (esp. 442-43).
