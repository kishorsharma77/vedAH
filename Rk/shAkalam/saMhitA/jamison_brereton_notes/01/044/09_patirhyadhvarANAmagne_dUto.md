As with vs. 4, the beginning of this verse connects with the final word of the previous one: 8d … svadhvara ‘o you of good ceremony’ / 9a … adhvarā́ṇām ‘of the ceremonies’.

svardṛ́ś- is a difficult word, with multiple interpretations. See Scar (pp. 234- 39) for discussion of the various possibilities, though his favored one (“das Sonnenlicht sehend”) seems to me the less common, since the adj. generally modifies gods. I generally take it as meaning ‘having the look/appearance of the sun’, that is ‘looking like the sun’, but occasionally as ‘having the sight of the sun’, that is, ‘seeing the sun’. Interpretations like Ge’s “deren Auge die Sonne ist” are unlikely because dṛ́ś- is not ‘eye’. See Re (EVP XII.81). In this particular passage, it is possible that ‘seeing the sun’ might also be appropriate, as anticipating the description of Agni in the next vs. (10b) viśvádarśata- ‘visible to all’. In other words, the gods in 9 “see the sun” and in 10 Agni, often homologized to the sun, is something that everyone sees.

I.44.10, 12: In my opinion, purohitá-, though preserving its literal meaning ‘set in front’, also already refers technically to a priestly office, the figure later known as the Purohita. Agni is called purohitá- both because he is literally ‘set in front’, that is, moved to the east to serve as the offering fire (later called the Āhavanīya), and because he serves as priest. JPB, however, does not believe that the word has developed this technical meaning in the RV. See esp. his 2004 “Bráhman, Brahmán, and Sacrificer,” in Griffiths and Houben, eds., The Vedas: Texts, Language & Ritual: Proceedings of the Third International Vedic Workshop, Leiden 2002, 325-44.
