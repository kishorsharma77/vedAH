The reference in this verse is not entirely clear, but “the lord of the wood” (vánaspáti-, ordinarily a word for tree, or an esp. prominent tree, then applied the sacrificial post) is probably here the pestle and metaphorically the erect penis. If so, ágram might be better tr. ‘tip’ than ‘top’ and the whole clause as “the wind blows across [rather than ‘through’] your tip.” In an unpublished paper on this hymn, "Rgveda I.28 and the Two Forms of Pressing Soma," Hanns-Peter Schmidt cites a Kuntāpa verse AV 20.136.6 = ŚŚS 12.24.2.7, which he tr. "The harlot, stepping over the mortar, said, 'Just as on thee, o tree (o wooden mortar), they strike (with the pestle) so may they strike on me,'" which also shows the connection of mortar and pestle with unlicensed sex. If the tr. is correct, the “lord of the wood” there is the mortar, not the pestle, as it seems to be here. In vs. 8 below, both the mortar and the pestle seem to be so called.
