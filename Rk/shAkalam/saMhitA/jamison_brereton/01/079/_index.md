Agni
Gotama Rāhūgaṇa
12 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, uṣṇih 4–6, gāyatrī 7–12
As its position in the sequence and its metrical disunity suggest, this hymn actually  consists of four separate hymns of three verses each (1–3, 4–6, 7–9, 10–12). The last  three are relatively simple in their construction and their contents, but the first is  rich and vividly descriptive and poses some problems of interpretation.
This first hymn segment begins (vs. 1) with quick sketches of different forms  of fire:  fire as sun (pāda a); fire as lightning (pāda b); ritual fire, especially as it  is kindled at dawn (pādas cd). This verse manages to convey dynamism without  the use of a single finite verb or participle. The next two verses (2–3) take up the  second image, fire as lightning, and develop it in unexpected ways. In our reading,  the ritual fire (that is, the god Agni) is compared with and ultimately identified  with the thunderstorm, and therefore its product, the fructifying rain, can be pre
sented, paradoxically, as the product of fire itself, a substance that in nature cannot  produce water. In verse 2 the zigzagging lightning flashes are the fire’s flames; the  bellowing bull is the roaring fire itself, and the flying mists and thundering clouds  are the billowing smoke. Verse 3 takes this naturalistic comparison to its logical but  unnatural conclusion: if fire is the embodiment of the thunderstorm, then it is full  of rain, a most desirable product, here called “the milk of truth.” In the last half of  this verse the principal Ādityas as well as Wind become involved by engorging the  clouds with water.
After this complex and allusive vignette, the other three hymn segments are  a serious anticlimax. In verses 4–6 Agni is asked to give wealth and fame and to  protect against demons. Wealth is also the preoccupation of verses 7–9. In the  final three verses the poet, Gotama, exhorts himself to give hymns to Agni, and  then implores Agni to keep demons away. There is nothing in these nine verses to  arrest the attention, but Gotama’s first three verses are indeed a worthy gift for  the god.
