tā́ni vṛ́ṣṇyā can be either nom. or acc. Most tr. opt for the former, but I do not see how “bullish powers” can be the agent of exhilaration in the same way that soma drinks are. Surely the point is to rouse Indra’s bullish powers for the fight to come.

Ge (/WG) take dáśa … sahásrāṇi as “ten thousand,” while Re separates the two numbers as I do. The former interpretation is certainly possible, although the distance between the words mildly supports taking them separately. The compound numbers in vs. 9 are adjacent to each other. However, note navatím … náva ‘99’ in I.54.6d.

A little phonological play: barhíṣmate … barháyaḥ.
