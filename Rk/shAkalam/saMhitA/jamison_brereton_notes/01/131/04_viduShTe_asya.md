Note the word play across the pāda boundary of a-b: pūrávaḥ, púro. The same play is found in I.130.7a … púro … pūráve#, though not so neatly juxtaposed.

In d tám is somewhat curiously positioned; it may have been displaced to allow the verb śā́sas to take initial position in order to echo sāsahānáḥ, which opens the previous pāda.
