Omen-Bird
Gr̥tsamada
3 verses: triṣṭubh
The last two brief hymns in Maṇḍala II have a popular character and call on the  “omen bird” (śakúni / śakúnti) to produce only auspicious cries. The second of the  two (II.43) playfully compares the bird to various priests in the ritual and is thus  reminiscent of the famous “Frog Hymn” (VII.103), which identifies the behavior of  frogs in the monsoon with that of priests.
## 1
Ever screeching, announcing its kind [=species], it directs its speech like  an oarsman his boat.
And if you will be of good omen, bird, let no evil eye at all find you.
## 2
Let not the falcon tear you up, nor the eagle. Let not a hero with arrows,  an archer find you.
Ever screeching in the direction of the fathers, you of good omen,
speaking auspiciously, speak here.
## 3
Screech down to the right of the houses, as one of good omen, speaking  auspiciously, o bird.
Let not a thief gain mastery of us, nor an utterer of evil. – May we speak  loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes.
