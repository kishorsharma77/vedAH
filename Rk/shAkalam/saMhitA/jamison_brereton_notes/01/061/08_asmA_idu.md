Although I tr. devápatnīḥ as ‘wives of the gods’, it is of course grammatically a bahuvrīhi ‘having the gods as husbands’ (with the fem. stem patnī- substituted for the masc. equivalent pati- in this feminine adjective). It reminds us of dāsápatnī- ‘having a Dāsa for a husband’, applied to the waters confined by Vṛtra, often identified as a Dāsa, most famously in I.32.11 but also twice elsewhere of the waters and Vṛtra (V.30.5, VIII.96.13). Since the context here is the Vṛtra battle (ahihátye), the complementary terminology is probably deliberate.

JL notes that there is complementarity also in the second hemistich: 8c has pári jabhre with Indra as subject and dyā́vāprthivī ́as object, while 8d reverses this: ná ... pári staḥ with dyā́vāprthiv ̥ ī ́as implicit subj. and Indra as implicit object (via his mahimā́nam). This theme and its lexicon are picked up in the 9ab: mahitvám / divás pṛthivyā́ḥ páry antárikṣāt.
