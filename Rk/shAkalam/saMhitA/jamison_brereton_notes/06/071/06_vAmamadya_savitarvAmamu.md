In c I accept the emendation of kṣáyasya to *kṣáyasi, which goes back to Aufrecht (see Old, Ge, Re, all of whom accept it; against this tide is Scar 353-54, though he doesn’t even note the general view). Inter alia, it provides an accented verb for the hí in pāda c; syāma in d is unaccented and should therefore not be construed with the previous pāda. ## 072 Indra and Soma Re’s brief comments are found in EVP XVI.108-9. His assessment -- “banal” -- is spot on. For the structure of the hymn, see publ. intro.
