By my rule (see “Vedic anyá- 'another, the other': syntactic disambiguation,” Fs. Beekes, 1997), because it is in (modified) 2nd position, anyé in c should be definite (‘the others’), not indefinite as Ge (/WG) take it. This makes perfect sense: we are well aware of the other sacrificers who are our rivals.

On sám … dadé and the idiom it expresses see comm. ad I.139.1. Although dadé here is usually ascribed to √dā ‘give’, the idiom sam √dā belong to √dā ‘cut’.

See Kü 242 for the three forms dadé / dade that belong to ‘cut’.
