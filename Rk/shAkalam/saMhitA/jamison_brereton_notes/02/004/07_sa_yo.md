The root √svad is generally a ritual technical term: the ritual fire “sweetens,” that is, “ritually prepares” the oblations. Here the forest fire performs the same action on the non-ritual ground. Although this might depict some version of slash-and-burn agriculture (so WG), I think it more likely that the point is merely to give a ritual dimension to the wild and unpredictable actions of the forest fire, in the hope of exerting some control over it. The same sentiment is found in I.169.3 agníś cid dhí ṣmātasé śuśukvā́n, … dádhati práyāṃsi “For even a fire blazing in the brushwood can produce pleasurable offerings.” The position of ná after the verb asvadayat in our passage suggests that the simile is targeting the verb, an extremely unusual situation in Vedic poetics.
