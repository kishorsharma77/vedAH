There seems no alternative to the problem posed by the ungoverned nouns in pāda a than Ge’s - to supply a verb, probably a form of √juṣ ‘take pleasure’ (perhaps mid. part. juṣāṇáḥ). This verb seems particularly suitable since it can take both acc. (puroḷā́śam) and gen. (ándhasaḥ). Ge, however, seems to be taking ándhasa as a dative (ándhase), contra Pp.: “(Koste) unseren Reiskuchen zum Somatrank.” The nominals in pāda a cannot be the object of ā́bhara because Indra doesn’t bring the cake or the stalk, but enjoys them and brings objects in return to those who provided them.
