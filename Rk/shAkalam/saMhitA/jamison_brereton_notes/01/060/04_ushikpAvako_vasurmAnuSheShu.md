Note the extraordinary pile-up of ‘house’ words in this vs.: dámūnā gṛhápatir dáma ā́. On the relation between the dám(a)- and gṛhá- designations for ‘house’ and their use in the RV, see my forthcoming “The Term gṛhastha and the (Pre)history of the Householder,” to appear in The Householder in Ancient India: A History of the Gṛhastha ed. P. Olivelle.
