The first two pādas of this vs. in the two hymns diverge from each other.

The third pāda contains cows and color (várṇa-) in both hymns and refers metaphorically to the same ritual action in both, the mixing of the soma with milk, but the metaphors differ as do the verbs. It is in this vs. that the two hymns are most distant from each other.
