Soma Pavamāna
Brhanmati ̥ Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn is structured as a ring of sorts: it begins and ends with quoted direct  speech, uttered by unidentified speakers but most likely priests. In verse 1 Soma  makes his journey through the filter to the place on the ritual ground where the  gods await their oblation. When he arrives there in verse 6, the priests order him to  take his seat. In between, Soma’s journey involves travel in both ritual and cosmic  space (see esp. vss. 2, 4).
## 1
You of lofty thought, swiftly rush around through your dear domain, to where they will say “(here are) the gods.”
## 2
Preparing what was not fully prepared, arranging the refreshments for  the people,
stream the rain from heaven all about.
## 3
Pressed, he goes into the filter, taking on vibrancy with his strength, gazing widely, producing wide illumination.
## 4
Here he is—the one with a rapid course who has flowed widely from  heaven into the filter,
into the swell of the river.
## 5
Seeking to lure from afar, and also from nearby, the pressed one
is poured as honey for Indra.
## 6
United they have roared. They impel the tawny one with the stones, (saying,) “Sit in the womb of truth.”
