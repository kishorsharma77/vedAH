The voc. phrase in c, citra vajrahasta, is repeated from 2a.

The verb prā́ḥ must be read disyllabically. It could therefore technically be a subjunctive (so apparently Gr), and in fact the light first syllable required could reflect the loss of root-final laryngeal before the subjunctive suffixal vowel.

Hoffmann insistently calls it an injunc. (215 n. 201, 221), fld. by Lub, and the publ.

tr. (“you … fill”) reflects an injunctive interpr. But since this is not a cosmogonic act

-- Indra is filling the world halves with “fame” -- a subjunctive interpr. is possible,
esp. following the impv.: “bring us fame with which you will fill both these worldhalves.” I consider this a possible, perhaps even desirable alternative.
