All these gods names are in the accusative, but there is no verb to govern them, either in the verse or in the immediately preceding or following pādas. One solution is to reach back to 2a ā́ACC káṇvā ahūṣata “The Kaṇvas have called ACC here,” though skipping over the intervening syntactic constructions is not appealing.

However, the recurrence of a similar construction in 5ab īḷate ACC … káṇvāsaḥ “The Kaṇvas solemnly invoke ACC” may suggest that the structure of invocation underlies the hymn.
