Sūrya (1-9), and a Spell against Disease (10–13)
Praskaṇva Kāṇva
13 verses: gāyatrī 1–9, anuṣṭubh 10–13
This final hymn of the Praskaṇva sequence falls into two parts. The last three  verses (11–13) have a clear Atharvan cast, as a spell against disease, specifically  jaundice. By sympathetic magic, the golden sun removes the jaundice from the  afflicted man and displaces it onto other, presumably yellowish creatures—parrots  and other birds.
The first nine verses, in a different meter, are a charmingly simple descrip tion of the rising of the Sun and the beginning of his journey across the sky.  The affinity of the intermediate verse (10) is not clear. Though it matches the  meter of the final three verses, in tone it seems more like a final verse summariz ing the happy result of the sunrise in verses 1–9. (It is not unusual for the final  verse of a hymn to be in a different meter from the rest.) If this is the case, then  the spell in verses 11–13 could have been tacked onto this hymn because of the  phrase “higher heaven” (11b), which echoes “higher light” and “highest light” in  verse 10.
