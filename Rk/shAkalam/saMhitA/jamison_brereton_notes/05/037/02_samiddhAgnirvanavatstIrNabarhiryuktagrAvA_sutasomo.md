Both Ge and WG take jarāte as ‘be awake’, even though Gotō himself (1st Klasse, 151 and 154) identifies this particular attestation of jára- as ambig. between ‘be awake’ and ‘sing’. Although both meanings are probably present, I think ‘sing’ is the primary one. The subject’s yoked pressing stones speak (grā́vāṇaḥ … vadanti) in the next pāda (2c), and throughout the RV there is generally an equivalence between the noise of the pressing stones and the speech/singing of the priests. See in particular in the immediately preceding hymn, V.36.4 grā́veva jaritā́… íyarti vā́cam “Like a pressing stone, the singer raises his voice,” with the agent noun belonging to the same root.

On the Adhvaryu’s trip to the river to fetch water on the morning of the pressing day, see Ge’s n. 2c.
