The vs. is notable for the dense repetition of the 2nd ps. sg. prn., with five exx. in the first three pādas.

The initial annunciatory ayám should probably be more clearly represented in the tr.: “this soma here …” For the metrically bad vavṛṣé see Kü (459) and comm. ad VI.4.7. As Kü points out, we would expect this seṭ root to have a pre-C weak perf. stem *vavūr-, which would fit the cadence here much better.

The publ. tr. renders mádāya yújyāya sómam as “the soma to be yoked for exhilaration,” falsely giving the impression that dat. yújyāya modifies acc. sómam. I now realize that the five occurrences of dat. yújyāya should be taken as nouns expressing purpose, not as adjectives. Interestingly four of the five passages have as main verb a form of √vṝ ‘choose’: VII.19.9 … vṛṇīṣva yújyāya …, VIII.4.15 prá … vṛṇīmahe, yújyāya …, IX.66.18 vṛṇīmáhe yújyāya, and our … vavṛṣe, … yújyāya.

There thus appears to be a fixed syntagm X yújyāya √vṛ “choose/select X for yoking (/for use),” and I would now tr. this passage “… the drop, the soma, which you have chosen for yoking for exhilaration.” I would not construe it directly with the adjacent dative mádāya, which is a separate expression of purpose.
