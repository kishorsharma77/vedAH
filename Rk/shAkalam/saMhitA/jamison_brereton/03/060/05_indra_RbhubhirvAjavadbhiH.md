O Indra, together with the R̥bhus bringing the Prize of Victory [=Vāja],  drench yourself in the soma pressed and sprinkled in the hands (of the  priests).
Urged on by insight, o generous one, become exhilarated in the
house of the pious one together with the sons of Sudhanvan, those  superior men.
