The position of ā́in b is distinctly odd, breaking up the simile gā́vaḥ … ná dhenávaḥ and not even placed at a metrical boundary; indeed, the pāda has an unusual break (⏑ / - ⏑) after late caesura. It is all the more puzzling because ā́has no apparent function in the vs.: √syand does not otherwise appear with ā́, and the usual nominal cases to which ā́serves as adposition are absent. Perhaps it’s a clumsy attempt to convert the simile gā́vo ná dhenávaḥ, which fits well at the end of a dimeter line (see VI.45.28 and nearby IX.66.12), into a Jagatī cadence. It’s also worth noting that a more conventional order … / *ā́gā́va ná dhenávaḥ, with ā́at the metrical boundary and the simile unbroken, would produce both a worse break and an impossible cadence. So perhaps this was the best the poet could do - though why does he need an ā́in the first place? Old suggests (ad II.3.3) reading *barhiṣ-ṣádaḥ with restored sibilant cluster.

However, of the six occurrences of this cmpd a heavy second syllable would make the meter worse in II.3.3, V.44.1 (bad breaks), though admittedly the other 4, which open the vs., might be somewhat improved by a heavy 2nd syllable. However, the evidence of the break should weigh more heavily than that of the opening. See Scar’s disc. p. 570 and esp. n. 806.

The mirror-image sequence (par)isrú(tam) usrí(yā́) is rather nice.

usríyāḥ in d can be either nom. or acc. pl. (see Old, who doesn’t decide). Flg.

Ge and Re, I take it as the an acc. pl. fem., taking part in a double acc. construction with nirníjam √dhā “assume X as garment.” As Ge points out (n. 1d) this is a paradox: the (masc.) soma drops are likened to cows (b) and provided with udders (c), but clothe themselves in cows(‘ milk) in d. By contrast, Scar (675) takes it as nom. pl., which is certainly possible, but less poetically fruitful.
