Abhy훮vartin C훮yam훮na is the subj. of the d훮nastuti in vs. 8.

As in VI.20.10, this vs. contains a 3rd sg. root aor. dart with retained (or restored) final cluster -rt, even though such retentions are supposedly only licit if the

-t belongs to the root. I argued ad VI.20.10 that the sandhi situation there favored the
retention of the cluster (before following dh- [< *h-]). I suggest that our form here has been adopted from that passage, since verse-final position would not favor the retention. Another passage containing dart that seems dependent on VI.20.10 is I.174.2b, identical to VI.20.10c, though in I.174.2 dart must be a 2nd sg., and so is doubly illicit.
