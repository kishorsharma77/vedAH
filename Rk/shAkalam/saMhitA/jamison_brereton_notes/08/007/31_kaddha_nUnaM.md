On kadhapriyaḥ see comm. ad I.30.20. Note kád dha … kadha-.

The verse seems to allude to the Maruts’ supposed leaving Indra in the lurch at the Vṛtra battle, but this seems to be a slander: it is often said that they were the only gods who stayed with him (though Ge adduces ŚB IV.3.3.6, where they temporarily withdraw until Indra offers them a joint share of the sacrifice [7ff.].).

Certainly 24c expresses their help to Indra at that time.
