As noted in the publ. intro., the use of īśāná- ‘having dominion’ here cleverly assimilates the patrons modified by this participle with Vāyu (2a) and IndraVāyu (5d), who receive the same modifier. 112 Ge (n. 6a) persuasively suggests that the striking phrase “confer the sun on us,” with the patrons as subject, refers to “the great light of the Dakṣiṇā” (priestly gift).

This is reminiscent of the biblical quotation “Let your light so shine before men …” that always preceded the taking up of the collection in the Episcopal church of my youth.
