Ge takes the wolf of ab as a simile, compared with the unexpressed Indra: “Wie der wilde Wolf … wartet er auf seine Zeiten.” But this requires taking cid as a simile marker, which I am loath to do. I consider it a general statement about nature — wolves follow their own patterns, however much they appear to be acting randomly. Indra, though he is apparently uncontrollable, attends to our ritual patterns and will come when called (which is similar to what vs. 7 says -- same yesterday, same today). So, although the behavior of the wolf is a point of comparison for Indra’s behavior, it is not a simile in the narrow sense. A similar comparison but in a real simile is found in VIII.33.8 ... mr̥gó ná vāraṇáḥ, purutrā́caráthaṃ dadhe "Like a wild elephant he has established his wandering [= his territory] in many places," where Indra is compared to a wild beast and the territory is somewhat like the vayúna- here.

On ā́√bhūṣ with vayúna-, see I.182.1.

Ge takes d as a separate clause, apparently supplying a form of √cit ‘appear’ (“erscheine …”), presumably based on citráyā and to be construed with prá.

Although the position of prá is suggestive, I do not see that separating the pādas is necessary, since d fits easily with c.
