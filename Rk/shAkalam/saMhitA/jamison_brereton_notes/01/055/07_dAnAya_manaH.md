“mind on” is the English idiom and is therefore used here, despite the Skt.

dative dānā́ya.

kéta- can belong either to gods or to men; here they must be Indra’s since they are identified with his sā́rathi- ‘coachmen, charioteers’. His intentions are presumably to come to the sacrifice for praise and soma and, more to the point from our point of view, to give to us, as expressed in the first pāda.
