 We have pressed—you two, drive hither—with the stones; these  
exhilarating ones here are mixed with cows [=milk]—these  
exhilarating soma drinks.  
You two kings, touching heaven, come here right to us, into our midst. These with their milk mixture are for you two, Mitra and Varuṇa—the  clear soma drinks and those with their milk mixture.
