Aśvins (except Heaven and Earth 1a, Agni 1b) 
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
25 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 24–25  
This tightly structured hymn conforms to the list format frequently found in Aśvin  hymns. A pāda-length refrain ends every verse but the last two (24–25), urging the  Aśvins to come with the same forms of help they have used in past rescues and  marvelous deeds. The first three quarters of each verse provides examples of said  deeds; as often in Aśvin hymns, many of these involve little-known or unknown  episodes and proper names of otherwise unidentified clients of the Aśvins, inter  
mixed with allusions to myths and legends found at least glancingly elsewhere. This  fast-moving catalogue occupies most of the hymn (starting especially with vs. 5,  through vs. 23), and its effect is to convince the audience that, with so many helpful  interventions behind them, the Aśvins will surely answer our calls for help, as finally  articulated in vss. 24–25.  

The beginning of the hymn (vss. 1–4), while the rhetorical pattern is still being estab lished, is more difficult and more syntactically and conceptually dense. The climax of  this portion of the hymn is verse 4, where the rhetorical pattern gets its full shape but  the content has not yet settled into the litany that follows. The pervasive double mean ing of verse 4 cannot be conveyed directly in translation, for each part of the verse, on  the one hand, identifies an unnamed divinity associated with the early-morning sacri fice (Wind [Vāyu], Agni, and Soma) by characteristic epithets, while, on the other, all  three descriptions are also appropriate to the Aśvins’ chariot (already mentioned in vs.  2), on which they will make the journey constantly alluded to in the refrain.
