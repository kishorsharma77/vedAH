This signature verse of Agastya’s Indra/Marut hymns appears in I.165.15, 166.15, 167.11, and 168.10, but not in all of his Triṣṭubh hymns even to Indra. The tr.

of I.165.15 (JPB) differs somewhat from the others (SWJ). JPB interprets mānyá- as a patronymic to a PN mā́na-, while I take it as an adj. ‘respectful’ derived from mā́na- ‘respect’. It is possible that both are meant.

Both tr. follow Old in reading ‘vayā́m ‘propitiation’ (SWJ) / ‘reconciliation’ (JPB) for vayā́m. This requires no emendation to the Saṃhitā text, only to the Pp. My tr. should, however, have an asterisk before ‘propitiation’ in all three cases.
