piśá- in b occurs only here in the RV, so although the meaning assumed by most (‘mottled [deer]’ vel sim., beginning with Sāy) is plausible, it has no other support. The plethora of wild animals in this run of verses (7: buffalos, wild elephants, 8: lions, snakes) does suggest that this term names animals too. Re by contrast tr. the etymological phrase piśā́iva supíśaḥ as “bien ouvragés comme des oeuvres-peintes,” though he is more cautious in his n. Kulikov (JIES: 2009) suggests ‘cheetah’ or ‘leopard’ on the basis of the wild animal company it keeps in its AV occurrence (AVŚ XIX.49.4 = AVP XIV.8.4). This is plausible but by no means certain.
