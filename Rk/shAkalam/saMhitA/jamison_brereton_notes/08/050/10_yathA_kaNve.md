Again the two versions are almost entirely parallel, with named examples of the beneficiaries of Indra’s bounty given in yáthā clauses, including some with very close similarities in wording: yáthā káṇve maghavan LOC LOC... (a) / yáthā góśarye √SAN … (C) / d: gómad dhíraṇya- (49d) / gotrám hari- (50d).

I differ from Ge in my interpretation of pāda b. He takes dīrghánīthe dámūnasi as another PN (so also Mayrhofer, PN, for the first but not the second), and I admit that parallelism with 49b, which contains a PN, is in his favor. However, here there is no yáthā marking the pāda as a different segment, and furthermore dámūnas- ‘domestic leader, master of the house’ is never otherwise used of mortals, but almost always characterizes Agni. Since dīrghánīti- is perfectly understandable in its literal meaning, I take this pāda as referring to Agni and as parallel to the locatives in pāda a indicating the sacrifice.
