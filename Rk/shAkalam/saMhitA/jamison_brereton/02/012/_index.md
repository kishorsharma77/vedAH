Indra
Gr̥tsamada
15 verses: triṣṭubh
This is one of the better known and most widely anthologized hymns to Indra. Its  distinctive rhetorical mark is its refrain, “he, o peoples, is Indra.” The “peoples”

(jána) refer to the Vedic peoples, and the hymn repeatedly returns to Indra’s past  victories over non-Vedic beings with the promise of future victories.
The hymn portrays Indra as a successful warrior. It begins with his origin (vs.  1) and then refers to his great deeds through which the world was created and made  inhabitable (vss. 2–3). The poet then announces Indra’s victory over Dāsas, Dasyus,  and other enemies and his aid for his worshippers and allies (vss. 4–10). Toward the  end of the hymn, the poet mentions Indra’s famous victories over his demonized,  if not quite demonic, enemies (vss. 11–12). Then he returns to Indra’s rule over the  cosmos (vs. 13) and his help for those now making ritual offerings to him (vss. 14–15).
One verse that has attracted particular attention is verse 5, which says that there  are some who wonder where Indra is and who declare that Indra “does not exist.”  These appear to be Vedic people who question Indra’s power and who, in deny ing Indra and refusing to perform the rituals, approximate the Dāsas, whom Indra  defeats (vs. 4). The poet insists that they should be aware of Indra as the “terrify ing” (ghorá) one and trust in him. At the end, in 15b, after recounting his great  exploits, the poet himself confidently asserts that Indra is indeed real. The reality  of Indra may signify not only his existence as a powerful god, but more especially  his actual presence at the poet’s sacrifice.
