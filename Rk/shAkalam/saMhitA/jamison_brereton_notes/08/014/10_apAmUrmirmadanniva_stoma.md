Misplaced simile marker in pāda a.

Both verbs in this verse are nonce forms: ajirāyate and arājiṣuḥ. Note their mirror image phonology, ajirā / arāji, which may help account for the creation of both the hapax denominative and the nonce iṣ-aorist. The former is built to ajirá- ‘quick’; the latter could belong to either of the √rāj roots, ‘rule’ or ‘shine’. Ge seems to opt for the former, at least judging from his invocation of ví rājasi in the preceding and following hymns (VIII.13.4=15.5) in his n., but his “haben den Ausschlag gegeben” (decided the issue) is hard to derive from ‘rule over’ and also doesn’t make much sense to me. But his n. also cites ví rājati in IX.61.18, where it clearly means ‘shines forth’, and also cites Sāy’s gloss dīpyante. Narten discusses the issue and finally decides (weakly) for ‘shine’, an interpretation I share.
