The phrase mahé … rāyé divítmatī is very reminiscent of IV.31.11 mahó rāyé divítmate, with an adverbial maháḥ but a dat. divítmate modifying rāyé. See comm. ad loc. It seems likely that our fem. divítmatī is a nonce adaptation to the fem.

context. As for divítmant-, I now tentatively accept the analysis of divít- as containing the root noun -i-t- and would alter the tr. to “as one coming from heaven” or “as heaven-sent one.”
