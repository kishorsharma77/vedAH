I do not think that Vāyu is being compared directly to the pressing stone, but rather than we call on Vāyu as we call on the pressing stone. Unfortunately this attenuates the force of the simile, but the various suggestions (Old, Ge, Re) as to why Vāyu is like a horse-backed stone are so convoluted that I find them difficult to accept. The stone may be called horse-backed for two reasons: first, since the stones are also called sóma-pṛṣtha- (VIII.63.2) and soma is commonly identified as a horse, the identification has been transferred. It may also be that it also means ‘having the back of a horse’, that is, bowed or made for carrying.
