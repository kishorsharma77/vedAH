ā́… bhānumádbhir arkaíḥ … tatántha is an elaboration of VI.6.6 (next hymn) ā́bhānúnā … tatantha. In our passage tatántha is accented because it follow pāda-initial, extra-sentential voc. ágne.

In c nayat ‘leads’ would seem to need an obj.; with Re I supply “us.” Ge leaves it object-less.

There is no agreement about where to construe the instr. śocíṣā. Re takes it with aktáḥ (“oint de flamme(s)”), while Ge’s interpr. isn’t clear (at least to me). I assume it goes with the VP: Agni’s bright flame illuminates the passage around the darkness(es).

I am rather baffled by the simile in d. The vṛddhi form auśijá- is usually used as the patronymic of Kakṣīvant, one of the great poets of maṇḍala I (e.g., I.119.9, 122.4, 5), but morphologically it could also simply be a derivative of uśíj- ‘(type of) priest’. It also occurs once (I.112.11) with the rare word vaṇíj- ‘merchant’; that passage also contains Kakṣīvant (though not in the same syntagm). Ge claims that our passage is part of “die Sage vom fliegenden Kaufmann,” but the two other passages he cites (one of them I.112.11) certainly do not add up to a saga, and dī́yan ‘flying, soaring’ does not have to belong to the simile as he (and Re) take it. I am inclined to think that the referent of auśijáḥ is, as usual, Kakṣīvant. His (other) patronymic, according to the Anukramaṇī, is dairghatamasa ‘descendent of Dīrghatamas’, another celebrated poet of Maṇḍala I, whose name means ‘having long darkness’ (=blindness, quite possibly). I suggest that we have here a reference to Kakṣīvant via the vṛddhi deriv. auśíja-, and this reference to Kakṣīvant then obliquely evokes his relationship to Dīrghatamas. So, somewhat ironically, a poet connected to “long darkness” leads us around (/helps us avoid) darkness. I would further suggest that pátman … dī́yan “soaring in flight” might refer to soma exhilaration (as in X.119 the Labasūkta). Cf. I.119.9 máde sómasyauśijó huvanyati “in the exhilaration of soma, (Kakṣīvant), the son of Uśij, cries out (to you),” where Kakṣīvant, identified as auśíjaḥ, cries out “in the exhilaration of soma.” If this nomenclatural intertextuality seems too far-fetched, we can take auśíjasimply as descended from / connected to (fire-)priests and assume that Agni is being compared to his priest (for, to me, unspecified reasons).
