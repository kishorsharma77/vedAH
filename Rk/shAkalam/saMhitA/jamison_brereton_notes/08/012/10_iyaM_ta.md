Encouraged by the insistent feminines, ṛtvíyāyatī here is a pun, referring both to Thought’s conformity to the ritual order and to her menstrual cycle. See 80.7 for the same word play involving dhī́ḥ, where the femininity of the subject is more emphasized than here. It is possible that the refrain here “she is (well- )measured indeed” can also refer to the menstrual cycle. Otherwise it probably refers to the metrical character of the thought and perhaps the fact that she measures up even to Indra’s great size. The refrain also has to be considered beside a phrase in the next hymn, VIII.13.30 mímīte yajñám ānuṣák "measures the sacrifice in proper order."
