On vivákṣaṇa- see VIII.45.11.

Ge takes pāda d as a separate clause and supplies a verb, while taking kṣudrā́ as “small animals”: “auf dass du … leibhaftig wie kleine Tiere (?) brav ver(mehrest)”

- an interpretation that seems to me both unnecessary and bizarre. The other RVic
example of kṣudrá- (I.129.6), which he claims also to refer to a small animal, I take to mean ‘speck’. It seems more sensible to take d as belonging with c, with the simile kṣudréva serving as object to kirā́si. The only evidence I can see against this is that √kṛ ‘scatter’ doesn't otherwise appear with prá in the RV, but that lexeme is common later. I take kṣudrá- here to refer to small particles of dust; see IV.38.7 kirate reṇúm.
