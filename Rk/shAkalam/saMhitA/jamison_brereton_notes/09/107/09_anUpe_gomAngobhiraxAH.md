Both instances of akṣāḥ should probably be read with distracted 2nd syllable, to provide the right no. of syllables in b and the right cadence in both pādas.

In addition, pāda a is metrically deficient, even with this distracted reading. We expect a 12-syl. pāda in the Satobṛhatī that provides the 2nd vss. of the pragāthas in this hymn; the Anukr. simply identifies the vs. instead as a Bṛhatī, which should have an 8-syl. pāda in this position. Even without distracted akṣāḥ, it would have 9 syllables, and with the distraction 10. Best to consider it a deficient Satobṛhatī, which is the vs.-form expected, than an over-abundant Bṛhatī. As for ways to make up the deficiency, see Old. A distracted reading of anūpé would provide at least one more syllable as well as a standard 4-syl. opening; however, neither etym. (*anu-Hp-á-; see EWA s.v.) nor the other occurrence of the stem (X.27.23) favors this distraction.

Old rather exasperatedly suggests that the metrical disturbances in this vs. (see also the Triṣṭubh cadence of c in a 12-syl. pāda) may result from “mangelhaftes Formgefühl des Vfs.”
