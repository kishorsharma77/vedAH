Although this vs. begins a new tṛca, it continues the series of pres.

participles that bring a vivid immediacy to the poet’s bids for help: kriyámānam (2b) ‘being performed’, nidyámānam (3c) ‘being scorned’, and here jā́yamānāḥ (4a) ‘being born’, pínvamānāḥ (4b) ‘swelling’. The dhruvā́saḥ ‘steadfast’ in c brings all this ongoing action to a halt, and deváhūtau breaks the series entirely -- until the next vss.
