In pāda a vípraḥ … matīnā́m reprises víprā matíbhiḥ of 35b in concatenary fashion. For further on this phrase see below.

Gr, Ge, and Re, as well as Lü (439), take ṛtā́as neut. pl., but this disturbs the syntax, and the tr. all must supply a verb to govern it. I suggest that it is instead the instr. sg. Re explicitly rejects this possibility on the grounds that it would be morphologically isolated. If he means that it would be the only such instr. to this stem, he seems to be correct, but given that the -ā instr. to them. stems is in retreat, this isolation would not be surprising. If he means that them. neuters don’t have instr.

in -ā, this is not correct: Lanman (Noun infl., 335) considers them more frequent than to the masc. and counts 77. Whether all his exx. would hold up under closer scrutiny is irrelevant: 77 would be difficult to reduce to 0.

The standard tr. also construe gen. pl. matīnā́m with ṛtā́, whatever sense they ascribe to ṛtā́, e.g., Ge “die rechten Wege der Gedanken,” Lü “zu den Wahrheiten der Gedanken.” They may be correct, and I could revise my tr. accordingly: “In accordance with the truth of the thoughts, Soma …” However, the association of vípra- with matí- is very strong - I just noted it in 35b in the previous tṛca, and the two words occur in the same pāda numerous times: I.82.2=VIII.25.24 víprā … matī́, I.86.2 víprasya … matīnā́m, II.24.13 vípraḥ … matī́, III.5.3 vípraḥ … matīnā́m, III.30.20=50.4 matíbhiḥ … víprāḥ, IV.3.16 matíbhir vípraḥ, V.80.1 víprāso matíbhiḥ, VII.78.2 víprāso matíbhiḥ, IX.63.21 matī́víprāḥ, IX.85.7 víprāṇāṃ matáyaḥ,


> 107.24
víprāso matíbhiḥ, X.6.5 víprāso matíbhiḥ, X.25.10 matíṃ víprasya, X.64.16 matíbhiḥ … vípraḥ, X.123.1 víprā matíbhiḥ; cf. also IX.71.3, X.11.6 vépate matī.

I therefore construe matī̃nā́m with vípraḥ in the publ. tr., as a loosely descriptive gen. In cd the phrase mithunā́saḥ … adhvaryávaḥ is taken by Ge (fld. by Re) as referring to the pair (or presumably multiple pairs, given the pl.) of Adhvaryu and Hotar. Although at least I.83.2, which he adduces for this sense, does seem to refer to that pair of two priests, in the dual, I think the pl. here instead refers to rivalrous priests at competing sacrifices, which must be implicit in Ge’s rendering, given the pl. They could be pairs of Adhvaryu and Hotar or (more likely in my opinion) just multiple Adhvaryus, each performing in a separate sacrifice.
