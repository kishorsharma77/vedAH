The praiṣa quoted at the beginning of this verse, matching the one opening the hymn, situates this verse in the ritual here and now, and such a context gives clues for the solution of some of the difficulties. Because the context is the soma sacrifice (the praügaśastra is part of the morning soma pressing; see also the pressing stone in e), I follow Ge in taking vanínaḥ as the gen. sg. of ‘wooden’ (rather than as the nom. pl. of a putative vanín- ‘winning’, with Re). The ‘wooden’ is the wooden cup and by extension its contents: soma. This interpr. in turn makes it unnec. to take vanta as a haplology of 3rd pl. *vananta (see Old). The bulls of b are likewise interpretable in a ritual context as the soma drinks.

Pāda f contains an incomprehensible hapax araríndāni, which, as so often, may have been stimulated by the phonological context: ádhārayadararindāni. Given the construction of the tag-pāda g it should refer to something compatible with sádmāni ‘seats’. My ‘fittings’ is only a placeholder, loosely implying a connection with √ṛ ‘fit together’ (also in ará- ‘wheel-spoke’, etc.) and inspired by the (presumably entirely accidental) echo of ἀραρίσκω. What -ind- would be under this analysis is utterly unclear.
