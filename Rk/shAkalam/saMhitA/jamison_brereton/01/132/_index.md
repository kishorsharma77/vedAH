Indra
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
6 verses: atyaṣṭi
This short hymn contains many puzzles of detail, which render much of the trans lation provisional, but the general theme is fairly clear. The present time and the  current sacrifice are repeatedly highlighted (see, e.g., vss. 1–2), and the contrast  between now and the past is explicitly drawn (see vss. 3–4). As is usual when past

and present are invoked together, we ask Indra to aid us in the same way as he aided  his companions in myth, particularly, here, the Aṅgirases at the opening of the Vala  cave (vs. 4). The theme of speech, both by and about Indra, is also strongly high lighted, especially in the first four verses.
