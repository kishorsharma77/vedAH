The 2nd sg. act. forms bhuvaḥ and bhūḥ that serve as the main verbs of the first two pādas respectively are difficult to distinguish. (Note that Hoffmann [Inj.

214-15] translates them both as “bist.”) The problem is made more acute by the fact that though bhūḥ is definitely a root aor. injunctive, bhuvaḥ can either be the injunctive (on which see comm. ad IV.16.18) or the subjunctive to the root aor., as it is, in fact, in 11d. I have made an effort to distinguish them in tr., and given the general preterital cast of this verse and the previous one I am reluctant to interpret bhuvaḥ as subjunctive (“you will become the counterpart of earth”), though that interpretation is not beyond possibility.
