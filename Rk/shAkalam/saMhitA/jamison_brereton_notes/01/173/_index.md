Indra The beginning of the hymn is characterized by pāda-initial injunctives in -at (1a gā́yat, 2a árcat, 3a nákṣat, 3b bhárat, 3c krándat; note also non-initial ruvád 3c and carat 3d). It is not surprising that this assemblage attracted the attention of Hoffmann, who tr. the first three vss. (Injunc., 143-44). The function of these forms is of course underdefined; I render them as simple general presents, more or less with Hoffmann (“die generalle Beschreibung eines Opfers”), sim. Ge. By contrast, Re takes them all as modal (“qu’il chante …,” etc.).

Another verbal pattern is the repetition of forms of the root √bhṛ: 2c bhárate, 3b bhárat, 4b bharante, 6d bhárti. In this case the poet seems to want to display how many different idiomatic meanings he can find in this root.
