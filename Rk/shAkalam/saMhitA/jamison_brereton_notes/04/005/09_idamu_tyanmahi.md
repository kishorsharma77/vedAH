These variously colored horses of Agni’s are, of course, his flames. The verb in d, ah(u)vanta ‘called’, can refer to the crackling of the flames: actual horses don’t ordinarily ‘call’ anyone. However, I think we’re also dealing with a pun, with ā́…  ah(u)vanta a phonological scrambling of *ā́… avahanta ‘conveyed’. Cf. III.19.4 sá ā́ vaha devátātim …, VII.1.18 .... vakṣi devátātim ácha, with the same obj.
