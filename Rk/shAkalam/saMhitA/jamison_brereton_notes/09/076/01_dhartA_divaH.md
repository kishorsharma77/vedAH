On pā́jas- see comm. ad I.58.3. For a god making or assuming his pā́jas-, see, with medial forms of √kṛ, IV.4.1 kṛṇuṣvá pā́jaḥ (of Agni) as well as IX.88.5 vṛ́thā pā́jāṃsi kṛṇute nadī́ṣu, identical to our passage except with a Triṣṭubh cadence, and, with ā́√dā, IX.68.3 pā́ja ā́dade. Presumably in our passage and 88.5 it depicts the swelling of the soma stalks in the waters.
