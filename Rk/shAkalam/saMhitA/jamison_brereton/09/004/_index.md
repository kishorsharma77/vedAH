Soma Pavamāna
Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa
10 verses: gāyatrī
Once again, the poet of this fourth hymn in the Soma Maṇḍala is also the author  of the fourth collection of hymns in Maṇḍala I (I.31–35), as well as another Soma  hymn, IX.69.
The thematic constriction of the soma hymns is even narrower than usual in this  hymn. A third of each verse is occupied by the self-contained refrain (pāda c: áthā no vásyasas kr̥dhi “then make us better off”), and many of the verses consist of  short imperative clauses. There are local repetitions as well: the initial “win!” (sánā)  of verses 1–3, the repeated pāda about resolve and help in verses 5b–6a, and the  initial “rush” (abhy àrṣa) of verses 7–8. Only two verses (6, 9) lack an imperative,  and the former contains an optative in similar usage.
These conscious formal limits of the hymn are obviously its point: content is  secondary. One might note, however, that the sun’s light is especially desired (vss.  2, 5, 6).
