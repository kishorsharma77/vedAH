As in the last verse the usual ritual roles of god and mortal are reversed, with Indra producing a praśasti of a mortal. I do not understand why, but, unlike 18c, there is no way to wriggle out of the undeniable purport of this verb phrase - thus supporting the “gods convey the oblation” interpretation of 18c.

tvám aṅgá reprises the tag of vss. 7-9, índro aṅgá, with of course the same referent.

I follow Ge (/WG) in taking vs. 20 as the quoted vácaḥ of pāda d, though it would be equally possible to interpret vácaḥ as referring to what precedes, indeed even to the whole of the hymn.
