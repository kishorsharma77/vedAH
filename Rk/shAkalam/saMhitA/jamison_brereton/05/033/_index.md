Indra  
Saṃvaraṇa Prājāpatya  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
The structure of this hymn is relatively straightforward. It begins (vs. 1) with  the poet’s praise of Indra, presented as an inducement to the god to come to his  sacrifice, followed (vss. 2–3) by the usual tropes of a “journey” hymn, includ ing the yoking of Indra’s horses. The poet recognizes that there are competing  sacrifices (vs. 4a), but continues to urge Indra to choose to come to his (vs. 5).  There follow two verses (6–7) asking for gifts from Indra. The hymn ends with  a three-verse dānastuti (8–10), praising the gift of horses from a number of dif ferent patrons.
