This vs. is a fairly straightforward account of the Indra-Vṛtra battle, though Indra’s name doesn’t appear until the last word.

I don’t quite understand the function of hí in pāda a. If it is causal (a value I always try to impose on hí), it may take up 2b: we know (at least in one interpr. of vs. 2) that Indra already knew (2b vidúṣe) about the trickery before the mother’s announcement, because he had already taken his position in the midspace. But this may be over-thinking hí. The hí in c is even harder to account for, and I wonder if it isn’t there to provide a mirror-image figure: míham … hī́m á(dudrot) and to serve as hiatus breaker between úpa and īm. IH offers an alternative explanation for the two hí’s. In IH’s account of RVic verbal function, aorists in subordinate clauses express anteriority. Here the hí would be a fine expression of post hoc, ergo propter hoc, with sequential events acquiring a causal cast: “because he had taken his stand, he bore down his weapon” and “because he had run up to him, he conquered …” In b vṛtrā́ya ACC prá √bhṛ echoes 2a vṛtrā́ya ACC √bhṛ. In my interpr. these expressions are contrastive and have different subjects and different intents (though see IH’s interpr. above): in 2a the dat. vṛtrā́ya is a dative of benefit, in 3b a dative of, as it were, malefit. The same vajrā́ya WEAPON prá √bhṛ as 3b is found in I.61.12.

The prá √bhṛ expression may be slyly alluded to even in our vs. 2, where prá opens pāda b and is therefore adjacent to ábhariṣyat pāda-final in a, even though it is construed with uvāca at the end of b.

In c Vṛtra must be the subj., even though it breaks the pattern: Indra is the unexpressed subj. of a and b and postposed subj. of d. However, Vṛtra has a penchant for mist (e.g., I.32.13, V.32.4), and in this context it would uniquely identify him.
