Agni  
Viśvasāman Ātreya  
4 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 4  
In verse 1 the poet Viśvasāman likely addresses himself. In doing so, he may be play ing on the significance of his name, which means “he to whom belongs every tune,”  for he calls on himself to chant to Agni. The fire is installed as the Hotar of the rite,  and like a Hotar he should be attentive. Therefore Viśvasāman asks that Agni be  attentive to his praise and to his words. The references to Agni as the “Hotar within  the clan” (vs. 1) and to the Atris (vs. 4) suggest that this short hymn was an address  to the clan fire of the Atris, and of course the fire of a clan of poets ought to be  especially attentive to the speech of poets and especially adorned by songs.
