Waters
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
4 verses: triṣṭubh
The waters are celebrated here primarily in their ritual employment, in the prepara tion of soma—though soma itself is not explicitly mentioned. These waters come to  be replaced by the rivers in the last two verses (3–4), but their physical characteris tics are not mentioned either. However, the final pāda before the refrain (4c) alludes  to the rivers’ making “wide space” for us, quite possibly an allusion to the enlarging  of the Ārya territory by crossing and conquering rivers.
