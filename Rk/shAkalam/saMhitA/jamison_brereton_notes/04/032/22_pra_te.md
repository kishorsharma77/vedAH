This very obscure dānastuti begins by presenting itself as an explicit formal praśasti (eulogistic praise), an important genre in later times and, in my opinion, the missing link between Rigvedic praise poetry and Classical kāvya (see Chap. IV in my Rigveda between Two Worlds), with the annunciatory verb prá … śaṃsāmi. I think this high-style opening is meant as a deliberate contrast with the bawdy nature of the gift praised.

As noted in the publ. intro. I consider “the two brown ones” (babhrū́) found in all three vss. of the dānastuti (22-24) to be the breasts of a woman given to the poet as a gift from his patron (a not-uncommon gift).

In c the poet playfully warns the patron not to stint on cows on the grounds that he’s already given him something else. The expression is quite condensed.
