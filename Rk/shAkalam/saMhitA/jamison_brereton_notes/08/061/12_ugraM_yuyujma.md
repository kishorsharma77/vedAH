The second member of the hapax compound ṛṇá-kāti- belongs with kā́makāti- ‘desiring desires’, and I therefore produce a more volition tr. than the usual ‘Schuld fordernd’.

The interpretation of the second hemistich depends on the interpretation of bhṛmám. Gr takes it as ‘error’, Ge as ‘impatience’ (Ungeduld), and see EWA s.v. for other suggestions. I consider it a derivative of √bhram ‘whirl’, and see it here as qualifying the vā́jin-, the prize-winning horse. The point is that a good charioteer recognizes a good horse even when it’s going so fast it becomes a whirling blur. And this fast horse is the one that the knowledgeable charioteer wants and will obtain.

Ge’s interpretation is very different: “Der Gewinner … versteht die Ungeduld, die den Sieggewohnten erfasst.” He takes bhṛmám as a noun, the object of védā, and the referent of the relative pronoun in d. Since he considers that rel. pronoun the subject of náśat, he must account for acc. yám by assuming attraction to vājínam from expected nom. *yáḥ. My interpretation avoids this unappealing change and also accounts better for the position of the particles íd ū, since vājínam belongs to the main clause not the relative clause, by my reading. Moreover, náśat should be a subjunctive, but his tr. fails to register that.
