The standard tr., also Old and Tichy (1995: 42), take sáṃgṛbhītā as the nom. sg. of an agentive -tar- stem, parallel to sánitā in pāda c, a form that should have fullgrade in the root syllable, *sáṃgrabhītā. I see no reason to reject the past participle it appears to be, in order to assume a wrongly formed alternative. Although RVic poets often make use of morphological parallelism, it is not a compositional requirement; in fact, they often take pleasure in expressing semantically parallel notions in morphologically dissimilar garb (see a nice example in 6a above, not to mention instr.

savyéna, loc. dakṣiṇé in this same hemistich). The verb yamati of pāda a can easily be read with b as well, and sáṃgṛbhītā also modifies the neut. pl. kṛtā́ni with no grammatical difficulty.
