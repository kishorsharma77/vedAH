The emphasis on the day here is striking. Two different ‘day’ words get used: #trír ā́divaḥ …, divé-dive … trír no áhnaḥ#, with the two parallel expressions polarized at the beg. and end of the hemistich. For another poss. passage with both words, cf. IX.86.19 and comm. thereon, where the possible semantic difference between the two words is explored.
