This vs. has a number of connections with phraseology elsewhere in this Agni cycle: ā́… bhānumádbhiḥ … tatántha (VI.4.6): ā́bhānúnā … tatantha (6a); dhṛṣatā́(3d, 6b); spṛ́dho bādhasva (VI.5.6): bādhasva … spṛ́dhaḥ (6cd, though with the two forms belonging to separate clauses, not a VP as in 5.6); vanuṣyā́t (VI.5.4): vanuṣyán vanúṣaḥ (6d).

The referent of the gen. phrase mahás todásya ‘great goad’ is not entirely clear -- some take it as some feature of Agni (e.g., Ge), others as the sun (e.g., Mau).

Most construe it with bhānúnā (as I do), though Re takes it with pā́rthivāni jráyāṃsi.

If, as is likely, it goes with bhānúnā, this provides a good clue to its identity. The bahuvrīhi svàr-bhānu-‘having the radiance of the sun’ is obviously based on a genitival tatpuruṣa *svar-bhānú- ‘radiance of the sun’, and GEN. bhānú- would simply be the analytic version of this cmpd., with the phrase mahás todásya substituted for putative gen. *sū́raḥ or *sū́ryasya. VI.4.6 ā́ sū́ ryo ná bhānumádbhir arkaíḥ “like the sun with its radiant rays” provides further support for this interpr.

Although it is true that in nearby VI.12.1, 3 the ‘goad’ (todá-) appears to be Agni, the qualifier ‘great’ in “great goad” here might point to the cosmic body, the sun, of which the earthly fire is a less powerful earthly counterpart.
