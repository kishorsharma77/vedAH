I take yajñíyānām as gen. for dat., as in 2a.

In b I assume that Agni obtains from the gods, and then gives to mortals, what the latter wish. Cf. a fuller expression in VI.5.7 aśyā́ma táṃ kā́mam agne távotī́“May we attain this desire, Agni, through your help.” On the basis of that passage, as well as X.96.7 só asya kā́maṃ … ānaśe, both with kā́mam √(n)aś, I also take nákṣat as an s-aor. subjunctive to √(n)aś, rather than as an injunc. to √nakṣ, pace Narten (s-aor.

160) and Gotō (1st Kl. 192), who assert that no such subj. exists to √(n)aś.

In d I take the position of nú within the instr. phrase yújyebhir nú devaíḥ seriously, indicating that the gods are now to be our yokemates, now that we have made successful sacrifice to them.
