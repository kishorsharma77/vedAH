Most tr. take a and b as separate clauses, to avoid direct comparison of the mace (vájraḥ) with the bellowing (raváthaḥ), but I consider this another example of the condensed and deliberately off-balance syntax of this hymn: the mace that roars is compared directly to the similar sound emanating from heaven; in other words, the verb krandati in the frame is transformed into the noun raváthaḥ in the simile.
