abhí sáṃ navante reprises abhí sáṃ navanta of 2b and perhaps confirms the preterital interpr. of that injunctive, since the verb in this vs. is marked as pres., though the gods are also subject here. However, how to interpret the tense values in the 2nd hemistich is unclear. Pāda c has an unambiguous impf. āyan, which, with its goal of immortality (amṛtatvám), would seem to refer to the remote mythological past (though see below). The verb is the last pāda, ádīdeḥ, can be either a plupf. (to the older stative pf. dīdā́ya) or an impf. to the new redupl. pres. remodeled from the pf. stem (Kü opts for the impf.; see 228). But whatever its morphological identity, it seems to refer to an event in the immediate past or the immediate neighborhood -- assuming that pitróḥ refers to the two kindling sticks -- namely, the regularly repeated kindling of the fire. This interpr. would be supported by 5c with pres. part.: jā́yamānaḥ pitrór upásthe “being born in the lap of your two parents.” In the publ. tr.

I assumed that the first hemistich refers to the regular kindling of the fire and the gods’ response, while the 2nd one refers to the Ur-kindling in mythological time.

However, I now wonder if we should interpret the abstract amṛtatvám in c in light of the voc. amṛta in pāda a. In the first hemistich Agni is addressed as “immortal one” when he is being born and the gods cry out to him; indeed the voc. “o immortal one” might be the content of their cry, expressed in the verb abhí sáṃ navante. In the second hemistich the gods went to immortality (amṛtatvám), that is, to the abstract quality possessed by the one addressed as amṛta, and they did so “according to your [=Agni’s] intentions” (táva krátubhiḥ), again when he was born. The gods’ journey to amṛtatvám may therefore not be one of the distant mythic past (or not only of the distant past), but one they undertake whenever he is kindled. The abstract principle of immortality may also be found in the gen. amṛ́tasya in the last pāda of the hymn (7d), where Agni is identified as its protector.

Note that the phrase víśve … devā́ḥ, parcelled out over two pādas, may teasingly invite us to connect the first term, víśve, with the dominant epithet in this hymn, vaiśvānará-.
