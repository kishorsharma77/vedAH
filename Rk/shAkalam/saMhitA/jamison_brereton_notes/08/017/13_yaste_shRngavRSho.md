kuṇḍapā́yya- is a technical term in later śrauta ritual; see Old. I have given a literal tr. of the word and disclaim any knowledge of what this verse really refers to.

The verb dadhre is taken by Old as most likely a 1st sg.; Ge allows that possibility but tr. with a 3rd sg. I supply Indra as subject, both because he is the deity of the hymn and because he is the default consumer of soma. Kü (264) takes the verb as intransitive and presential with mánaḥ as subject: “darin bleibt das Denken fast.” He also notes the possibility that this is a 3rd plural to √dhā, rather than belonging to √dhṛ.
