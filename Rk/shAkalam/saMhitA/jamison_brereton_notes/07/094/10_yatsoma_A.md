This vs. is a fragment, a yád clause without a main cl. It also contains an augmented intensive ájohavuḥ; this preterital form seems out of place in a hymn that lives almost entirely in the ritual present (our actions for Indra and Agni) and immediate future (via the imperatives we address to those same gods). (Only ajani in vs. 1 is preterital, but this aorist refers to the immediate ritual past.) The verse is also one of the few in this hymn that lacks parallel pādas or near repetitions elsewhere.

(See Ge’s nn and Bloomfield, RReps for some of the details, though Bloomfield does not list partial repetitions.)
