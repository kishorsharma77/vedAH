Although the sense of this verse is fairly clear, the second half-verse displays some syntactic intricacies, namely, what I consider two conjoined NPs that interact with each other in various ways and for which there is only one overt conjunction, ca in somewhat anomalous position. I take the two pāda-initial instrumentals évaiḥ and ūtī́as forming one NP, with both indicating qualities of Indra’s (differently Ge, who takes évaiḥ with the verb: “rufe ich … mit Eifer”), and the two pāda-final genitives carṣaṇīnā́m and ráthānām as a second NP, dependent on either ūtī́alone or évaiḥ … ūtī́jointly. The single ca connects the two instrumentals in an X ca Y construction. This seems to me superior to Klein’s interpretation (DGRV I.172, 192-93) as a ca XY construction, with the ca conjoining the two genitives. For évaiḥ as the quality of a god, not an adverb, see, e.g., X.67.11.
