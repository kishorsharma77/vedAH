On kukṣí- as ‘cheek’, not ‘belly’, see Jamison 1987 (Ged. Cowgill).

As Ge also comments, the chronological sequence of pāda d seems reversed, assuming (as I generally do) that the perfect participle regularly expresses anteriority: Indra drank the soma before smashing Vṛtra. The primary VP here, avṛṇīta sómam is found in the great Indra hymn I.32.3, but with a different opening (vṛṣāyámāṇaḥ).
