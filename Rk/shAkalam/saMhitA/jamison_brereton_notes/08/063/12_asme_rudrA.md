I have no idea what the mountains have to do with anything and why they and the Maruts should be in agreement. (Ge takes sajóṣāḥ only with the mountains, but this doesn’t help.) Since there is in fact no overt ‘and’, it is possible that the Maruts are being referred to as mountains (“… the Rudras, ‘mountains’ in their profusion, are of one accord…”).

The relativization in cd is somewhat shifty: the yáḥ should refer to Indra, who is the first member of the compound in the main clause índrajyeṣṭhāḥ ‘having Indra as chief’.
