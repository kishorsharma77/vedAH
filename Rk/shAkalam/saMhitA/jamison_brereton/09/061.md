Soma Pavamāna
Amahīyu Āṅgirasa
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
The first sixty hymns of the Soma Maṇḍala, all in gāyatrī meter, are arranged in the  normal order of descending number of verses, starting with hymns of ten verses  and ending with those of four. (The only exception is the Āprī hymn, IX.5, which  has eleven.) But the gāyatrī sequence ends with six thirty-verse hymns (IX.61–66),  followed by one with thirty-two verses (IX.67)—all arranged in tr̥cas (the final two  verses in IX.67 are supplements) and each attributed to a different poet or group  of poets—before the jagatī group begins. It is probably not an accident that these  groupings of tr̥cas come at the end of the gāyatrī sequence, since, as agglomerations  of three-verse sequences, they logically follow the four-verse hymns.
In this particular hymn there is little evidence of unity either within tr̥cas or between  them: the standard topics of soma hymns—the details of preparation (e.g., vss. 4–5)  and the gods for whom he’s prepared (e.g., vss. 8–9), the cosmic connections of Soma  (e.g., vss. 10, 16, 18), and the largesse and aid we ask him for (e.g., vss. 3, 23–24)—
are strung together in no apparent order. There is a discernible tendency, however, to  emphasize Soma’s role in combating hostile forces, either directly or by strengthening  someone else to do so, especially Indra. The hymn begins with two verses mention ing some of Indra’s exploits performed under the influence of Soma, though without

naming Indra, and the theme of Soma the smiter and aggressive warrior returns  toward the end of the hymn and dominates the last two tr̥cas (vss. 19–20, 22, 24–30).
## 1
Flow around in pursuit (of him) who amid your raptures, o drop, smashed down the nine and ninety—
## 2
(Smashed down) the strongholds in one day for the one whose thought  is to the point, (smashed down) Śambara for Divodāsa,
and as for that Turvaśa and Yadu... .

Stream around to us horseflesh, as horse-finder, and (wealth) in cattle  and gold, o drop,

Your waves that flow into the filter in a stream—

Your exhilarating drink that is worthy to be chosen, with that stalk  purify yourself,
pursuing the gods, smashing those who utter evil.

Smashing Vr̥tra the hostile, winning the prize every day,

Smashing away the scorners, away the ungenerous, Soma purifies himself, going to the rendezvous with Indra.
## 26
Bring great wealth here to us, self-purifying one; smash the scorners. Give glory in heroes, o drop.
## 27
A hundred crooks [/wool tufts] will never confound you when you are  eager to give largesse,
when you, becoming purified, do battle [/act bounteously].
## 28
Purify yourself, o drop, when you, the bull, are pressed. Make us  glorious among the people.
Smash away all hatreds.
## 29
In the companionship of you here, in your highest brilliance, o drop, might we overcome those who do battle.
## 30
Your fearful sharp weapons, which exist to injure,
(with them) guard us from the insult of anyone at all.
