Maruts
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 14
One of the most intensely descriptive of the Marut hymns, with shifting images  of the violent thunderstorms and welcome rain that they provoke. There is no  particular progress or development in the hymn, just the succession of exuberant  descriptions. The last three verses (13–15) shift to prayers for the Maruts’ gifts  and help.
