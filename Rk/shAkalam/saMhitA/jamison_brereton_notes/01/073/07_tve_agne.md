The voc. agne was inadvertently omitted from the publ. tr., so “o Agni” should be inserted after “in you.” The second pāda could also mean “they acquired fame in heaven.” The phrase should be read with 5d bhāgáṃ devéṣu śrávase dádhānāḥ and 10c ádhi śrávo devábhaktaṃ dádhānāḥ. The latter passage, especially, suggests that ‘acquire’ is the better rendering.

The accented cakrúḥ in c can be explained, following Klein (DGRV I.176-77), as triggered by the “rhetorically complementary nature of pādas c and d.” There is no need to take the ca in c as a subordinator, particularly because subordinating ca introduces conditional clauses. Note the contrast between ví(rūpe) and sáṃ (dhuḥ), a common rhetorical pairing.
