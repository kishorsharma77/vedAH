Ādityas  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
3 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn is a general exhortation to the Ādityas to protect the sacrifice, keeping  its performance in “offenselessness” (adititvá), in accordance with their character as  sons of Aditi, the goddess who represents offenselessness or innocence. In the later  rite the offering of soma to Mitra and Varuṇa (as well as to the other dual divini  
ties) takes place in the morning and that to the Ādityas (as well as to other divine  collectives) in the evening. The gods in the last verse are worshiped at various times  in the sacrificial day, but there appears to be an emphasis on gods associated with  the evening rite: the Ādityas, All Gods, R̥bhus, and even the Aśvins, who are con  
nected with both the morning and the evening rituals.
