On the somewhat anomalous use of nṛcákṣas- here see comm. ad III.53.9.

The first pāda of this vs. seems to imply that, though the higher seats of the gods are not generally visible (5d), a kaví-, despite having only a man’s sight, has been able to see (abhí … acaṣṭa) Heaven and Earth whole, and that he is cognizant of the crucial paradox about them --- that they are joined but still distinct -- a paradox treated in the rest of the vs. and the following one (7).

The interpr. of b is hampered by the hapax víghṛte. On the surface it appears to belong to the root √ghṛ ‘sprinkle’, but it is difficult to make this yield immediate sense. It appears to serve the same function as víyute ‘separated’ in the next vs. (7a), and it has therefore been suggested that -ghṛta- actually belong to the root √hṛ ‘take’ or is a byform thereof (see, e.g., KEWA III.578). My publ. tr. reflects a tacit acceptance of such a view (or at least a willingness not to probe it too deeply), but I now wonder (without full conviction) whether in the context of mádantī ‘becoming exhilarated’ a sense that connects víghṛte to √ghṛ ‘sprinkle’ might be possible: “sprinkled separately but becoming exhilarated (together).” In any event I take it as a dual fem. acc. (with Ge [/WG]), not, with Re, a loc. sg. with yónā.

My tr. also depends on assuming that the exhilarating is happening jointly, in contrast to whatever type of separation is indicated by the ví-prefixed ppl. -- the same contrast between unity and separation found in cd. The place where this is happening in b, “the womb of truth” (ṛtásya yónā), may refer to two different places, the ritual ground (as so often) and, perhaps, the distant invisible seats referred to in 5d.
