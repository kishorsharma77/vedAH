The first pāda, agníś ca yán maruto viśvavedasaḥ, is a particularly complex ex. of a reverse vā́yav índraś ca construction, with the subordinator yád placed, in modified Wackernagel’s Position, after the first term and a voc. adj. attached to the second. This sequence of three vss. (6-8) contains three different versions of the awkward pairing of singular and plural entities in a voc. phrase: vs. 6 with its independent non-adjacent vocc. rudrāḥ … ágne, this vā́yav índraś ca construction, and 8a ágne marúdbhiḥ with an instr. of accompaniment. Note that the adj.

viśvavedasaḥ, which, since it’s voc., should technically only modify the Maruts, is more commonly applied to Agni in the RV, and so he should probably be included in its domain.

The problematic epithet ríśādas- has already been discussed; see comm. ad I.2.7. As indicated there, the publ. tr. weakly favors Th’s ‘caring for the stranger’ over Hoffmann’s ‘fastidious’. The original meaning is difficult to get to, because by either etymology (or any other one) the word would by this time be entirely opaque and, with no synchronic lexical anchoring, it would have been free to float semantically and get attached to other words secondarily. It is often used of the Ādityas, both collectively and individually, for whom ‘caring for the stranger’ is a quite congenial reading. But it is also, as here, often used of the Maruts, where it is not so good a fit. But generally when it is applied to the Maruts, it is either with reference to their benevolent and generous aspect (as here, where they are viśvavedasaḥ ‘affording all possessions’ and are urged vāmáṃ dhatta “establish a thing of value”) or is found nearby occurrences with the Ādityas (so here and V.61.16, with Mitra and/or Varuṇa V.64.1, 66.1, 67.2; cf. also I.186.8 riśā́daso mitrayújaḥ) or both (cf. Agni, the Ādityas, and the Maruts all as both viśvávedasaḥ and riśādasaḥ in VIII.27.4).
