A grammatical figure in the pāda-initial reduplicated i-stems, b cákriḥ, c jágmiḥ, both functioning as verbs (cákriḥ takes acc. direct object ápaḥ; jágmiḥ an acc. goal nṛṣádanam). For this type see Grestenberger 2013 (JAOS 133).

ápo náryaḥ is reminiscent of ápāṃsi … náryāṇi in the next hymn (VII.21.4), though there the words form a phrase and here they are in two different cases and numbers.
