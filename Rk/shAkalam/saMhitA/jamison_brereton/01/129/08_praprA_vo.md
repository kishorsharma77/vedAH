(Let) Indra (be) more and more preeminent among us with his
self-glorious help in the shunning of bad thoughts—in the shattering  of bad thoughts.
She herself [=Bad Thought] is to be harmed who has sought us out
with her devourers.
She will be smashed, she will not wax strong—like a firebrand flung
aside she will not wax strong.
