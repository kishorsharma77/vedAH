The 2nd hemistich has intensely alliterative (partially) etymological figures: gúhā hitáṃ gúhyaṃ gūḷhám apsú, háste dadhe dákṣiṇe dákṣiṇāvān. The first half is more restrained but note the morphological pair padvát … śaphávat and the repetition of viveda from 5d.

The phrase náme goḥ is puzzling; Ge refuses to tr. náme. Old suggests ‘Sichneigen’, which is essentially literal and not very helpful; Re ‘domaine’, which makes sense but is not clearly related to its supposed etymon; WG “beim Zuteilen der Kuh,” also without accounting for the semantic development (or assuming a derivation from the separate PIE root *nem, as in Greek νέμω ‘distribute’?). Like Old I also take it literally, as the loc. sg. of a thematic noun to √nam ‘bend, bow’, but suggest that “the bend of the cow” is some sort of homely spatial metaphor drawn from knowledge of cow anatomy indicating a hidden or protected place. English ‘oxbow’ for a U-shaped configuration of a river is a similar application of pasturage terminology to physical space. Cf. also ukṣṇó rándhram (VIII.7.26) “the loins of the ox,” which I also think is a way of referring to the Vala cave. See comm. ad loc.
