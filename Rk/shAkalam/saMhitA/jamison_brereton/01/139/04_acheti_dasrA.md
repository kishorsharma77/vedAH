It has appeared, wondrous ones: you two unclose the firmament;  your chariot-horses are yoked at the rituals of daybreak—the  
unbesmirched ones at the rituals of daybreak.  
Your station is on your chariot box, on your golden chariot,  
wondrous ones—  
(you two) going as if on a path, directing (the chariot) through the  dusky realm—directing (it) straightway through the dusky realm.
