The son of Mamatā is, of course, Dīrghatamas, our poet.

In my view, the verse is describing the feeding of the fire with streams of ghee, the milk-cows (dhenávaḥ) of pāda a; the “same udder” (sásmin ū́dhan) is the fire place. Ge (/WG) see the cows instead as the rains and give a more cosmic spin to the whole verse. But pāda c esp. supports a ritual interpr., as does the instr. ‘by mouth’ (āsā́) in d, so characteristic of the ritual Agni.

For my transitive interpr. of brahma-prī́- ‘pleasing x with the formulation’ (contra ‘loving the formulation’ or ‘friend of the formulation’ of all others, including Scar [338]), see comm. on I.83.2. In that passage the transitive value is strongly favored by context; here, given Agni’s usual middle-man role as both sacrificer and sacrificed to, it is less clear. I could accept ‘loving the formulation, pleased by the formulation’ here.

In d the literal sense of á-diti- ‘boundless(ness)’ works well with the main verb uruṣyet ‘he should make broad space’. What, if anything, the goddess Aditi is doing here is unclear to me. Ge suggests that the sense vacillates between the goddess and the abstract noun, with the goddess the obj. of avívāsan ‘seeking to win’ and the abstraction of uruṣyet. This seems reasonable: because Agni’s mouth is the conduit of the oblations to the gods, “seeking to win” the goddess “with his mouth” would mean attracting her to the sacrifice to consume the oblation by means of his mouth (/flames), while the abstract sense of the word expresses our own wish for boundlessness or freedom. I would now emend the publ. tr. accordingly to “Seeking to attract Aditi with his mouth, he should make broad space for boundlessness.” Note that Aditi is identified with a milk-cow in I.153.3 below, a hymn with many verbal and ritual ties to I.151-52. There Aditi the cow herself swells (pīpā́ya dhenúr áditiḥ), while the cows in this passage cause Agni to swell (pīpayan).

For a quite different interpr. of the vs., see JPB’s Ṛgvedic Ādityas, pp. 200-1.
