Note that all pādas begin with 3rd sg. preterite verbs: a ágachat, b ásūdayat, c sasā́na, d (modified initial pos.) áthābhavat (which most likely represents átha abhavat, though áthā bhavat is possible). All but the perfect in c are augmented imperfects; this contrasts markedly with vs. 6, which, as was just noted, contains four 3rd sg. injunctives, three of them aorists. Three of the four pādas of vs. 7 also end with nom. sg. masc. pres. participles: a sakhīyán, c makhasyán, d árcan.

Pāda b configures the release of the cows from the Vala cave as a birth, but a birth overlaid with metaphor (“brought to sweetness”).

In c the standard tr. (save for Re and Klein, DGRV II.67) take makhasyá- as ‘being generous’ vel sim. But in all three occurrences of this verb stem (here and IX.61.27, 101.5) the ‘do battle’ sense is primary. Since it co-occurs with sasā́na ‘won’ in this pāda, the ‘battle’ sense seems esp. appropriate. So Re “comportant-encombattant.” For further on makhá- see comm. ad I.18.9.

My tr. of d, áthābhavad áṅgirasāḥ sadyó árcan, differs in an important way from the standard. In my opinion it states that Indra became an Aṅgiras as soon as he sang; the others that the Aṅgiras [=Indra] right away became a singer (e.g., Ge “Da ward sogleich der Aṅgiras zum Lobsänger”). On the one hand, I’m not certain that √bhū + pres. part. can yield this sort of predication, esp. with the pres. part. standing in, in effect, for an agent noun. So -- a syntactic argument, though I have not examined the evidence in detail. Another syntactic/lexical argument: sadyáḥ + participle is frequently used to indicate the circumstances under which the action of the main verb takes place. This is esp. common with sadyó jātáḥ “just born” / sadyó jajñānáḥ “having just been born” -- e.g., the next hymn, III.32.9 sadyó yáj jātó ápibo ha sómam (≅10) “Just born, you drank the soma” (and cf. III.29.3). But the prevailing interpr. here requires the sadyáḥ to go with the main verb, despite its position directly before the participle -- e.g., Klein “And then did the Aṅgiras straightway become a singer.” And finally a semantic objection: the proposed tr.

seems to me thematically backwards. Indra joins the category of the Aṅgirases because he joins them in song, which is their principal function in this myth; he is not an Aṅgiras by nature who happens to start singing. (This point is made, more or less, by Schmidt [173], despite his contrary tr.)
