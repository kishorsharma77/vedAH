In the publ. tr. I supply with gúhā a form like hitám (cf. I.23.14, II.11.5, IV.5.8, etc.), cárantam (III.1.9) or cátantam (I.65.1, X.46.2) referring to Agni when he was hiding in the waters, a myth I also think is referred to obliquely in vs. 2 of this hymn (see above). Our vs. 2 is especially close to X.46.2, which relates this story, and X.46.2c begins gúhā cátantam (and continues with a ref. to the uśíj-; see our 5b).

I therefore think my suggestion is justified, though I am usually reluctant to supply extraneous material. The point is -- if the Gṛtsamadas (re)gain the hidden Agni, just as their ancestors the Bhṛgus did, they will get the upper hand against their enemies.

The standard tr. must construe gúhā with vanvántaḥ ‘gaining in secret’ (e.g., Ge “heimlich überbieten und uüberwinden”). Although this is the obvious way to construe the text as given, the notion that our side would win by stealth and secret means seems antithetic to the Rigvedic ideal of combat, whether on the battlefield or the ritual ground. The adverb gúhā is extremely common in the flight-of-Agni myth and in an Agni hymn would likely call to mind the whole story. I would now be inclined to emend the publ. tr. to “(the one hiding) in secret,” not “(… deposited) in secret,” because of its apparent dependence on X.46.2 or a passage like it.
