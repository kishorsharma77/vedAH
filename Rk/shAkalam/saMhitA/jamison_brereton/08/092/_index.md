Indra
Śrutakakṣa Āṅgirasa or Sukakṣa Āṅgirasa
33 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 1, arranged in trcas ̥
This long, loosely structured hymn is essentially a constantly repeated invitation to  Indra to come to the soma sacrifice. Although the poet does ask for aid from time  to time, the focus is on the sacrifice, the verbal accompaniments, and the soma itself.  The poet names himself (or nicknames himself: the name is Śrutakakṣa “having a famous armpit” [or a famous crotch]) in verse 25. This nickname appears in the  midst of a striking sequence using the adverb áram “fitting(ly)” (vss. 24–27) in a  clever shift implicitly equating Indra’s body parts (e.g., “fit for your cheek” vs. 24a)  with the gifts the poet hopes to receive (e.g., “fit for a horse” vs. 25a), at least once  punningly: verse 35c, where the word dhā́mane can refer both to a body part, the  “fundament,” that is, the buttocks, and to Indra’s conferring of gifts.
