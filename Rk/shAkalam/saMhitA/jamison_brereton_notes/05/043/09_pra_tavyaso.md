The function of utá in the pāda-final phrase utá tmán is unclear. Klein (I.347, 349) treats it as an example of an X Y utá construction (suggesting several diff.

possibilities), but does not consider the positional tendency of tmán(ā) or the dossier of rhetorically similar phrases. Both tmán and tmánā have a distinct preference for pāda-final position, with a word consisting of two light syllables preceding as here -- frequently iva, also úpa, etc. As a parallel to our passage, cf. esp. IX.88.3 … draviṇodā́iva tmán. I'm inclined to think that utá is in fact empty here (though perhaps orig. adapted from places where it made sense) and Klein's piecemeal attempts to make sense of the various passages misplaced. Here the utá was perhaps slotted in because iva was inappropriate. One can also keep in mind that -a tmánrecalls (and replicates metrically) ātmán-. Re’s characterization of utá tmán as “type de clausule inert” seems close to my “empty.”
