As Ge points out, the mention of the All Gods (viśvádevya-) marks the ritual reference as the Third Pressing, which is dedicated to the All Gods and in which the Ṛbhus have their share. This suggests that the repeated stretching in pāda a need not refer only to the periodic nature of Vedic sacrifice over the ritual year, but also perhaps to the repeated rites of the Soma pressing day. Since the theme of the “leftover” is prominent in the Third Pressing (see Jamison 1996: 129-32), “being stretched out again” fits this context.
