On the “fourth formulation,” see Hyenas 251-60.

The “circling magic spells” (māyā́ḥ … vártamānāḥ) of Svarbhānu are the plumes of Agni’s smoke rising to heaven and obscuring the Sun’s light (Hyenas 271- 73).

ápavratena ‘against commandment’ is generally taken to refer to the darkness deployed by Svarbhānu, but I argue (Hyenas 297-300) that it actually refers to the Sun’s original action, incest with his daughter, that led to his punishment by Agni Svarbhānu.
