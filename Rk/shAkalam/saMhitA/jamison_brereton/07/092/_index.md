Vāyu (1, 3–5), Indra and Vāyu (2)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The “teams” of Vāyu are the primary topic of this hymn. They are identified as  thousandfold in the first and last verses of the hymn, forming a conceptual ring,  and in the middle verse (3) the productive ambiguity of the word is exposed: the  teams are not merely the wind-horses that bring Vāyu here, but also the many forms  of wealth he brings to us in return for the sacrifice. The even verses (2 and 4) first  make the invitation to the sacrifice clear and then express wishes for success both  for the priests and poets and for the patrons.
