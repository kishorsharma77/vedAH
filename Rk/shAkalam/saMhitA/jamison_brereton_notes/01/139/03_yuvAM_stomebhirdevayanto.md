The part. āśrāváyanta(ḥ) is best taken as predicated, substituting for a main verb. The standard tr. supply a finite verb (“invite” vel sim.), but this seems unnecessary.

This form also participates in a fine example of case disharmony in a simile (in the sense of Jamison 1982): śrāváya-/śraváya- can mean both “cause to be heard” and “cause to hear.” In the simile (pāda b) it takes ślókam as obj. and means “cause to be heard”; in the frame (pāda a) it takes yuvā́m and means “cause to hear,” while in the tag-pāda (c) it likewise takes yuvā́m but also a 2nd acc. havyā́, with the meaning “cause X to hear (about) Y.” With Ge I supply “of the pressing stone” with ślókam on the basis of 10e ślókam ádreḥ.

Unlike the standard tr. I supply “chariot” as the obj. of anuśā́satā and take rájaḥ as an acc. of extent.
