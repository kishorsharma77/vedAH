Indra
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
10 verses: atyaṣṭi, except triṣṭubh 10
The first two verses of the hymn provide a conventional opening, with an invitation  to Indra to journey here to drink our soma. But this journey motif gives way to a  rapid sampling of Indra’s great deeds: Vala (vs. 3), Vr̥tra (vss. 4–5), battles against  various human and legendary enemies (vss. 7–8), ending with a truly impenetrable  verse (9) about the theft of the wheel of the Sun’s chariot and the involvement of  Uśanā, a myth that also elsewhere evokes all the obscurantism the Vedic bard has in  his control (see, e.g., V.29 and 31). The final verse of this hymn, in a different meter,  sums up the poets’ efforts to praise Indra. The emphasis on mythology in this hymn contrasts sharply with the immediately  preceding Indra hymn, by the same poet in the same meter, which lacks any mytho logical content.
