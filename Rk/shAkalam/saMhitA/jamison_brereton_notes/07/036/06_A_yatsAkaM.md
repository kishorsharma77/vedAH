According to Old and Ge, this vs. consists only of dependent clauses, and this is certainly true descriptively: there are two subordinate clauses marked by the subordinating conj. yád ‘when’ (a) and the rel. prn. yā́ḥ (c), one accented verb (suṣváyanta) in the rel. cl. of c, and no main verbs. In the publ. tr. I take d as a covert main clause, signalled only by the preverb abhí, with which I supply a verb of motion. However, it is perfectly possible that d is simply a continuation of the rel. cl.

of c, though I do not then know what to do with the abhí init. in d. Under the interpr.

with cd as rel. clause the 2nd hemistich would simply be “who are richly fertile, rich in milk, rich in streams, swelling with their own milk.” In any case, if it lacks a main clause, the vs. cannot be attached either to preceding vs. 5 or following vs. 7; it would have to be an independent if incomplete structure.

The first hemistich lacks a finite verb, and in my view the participle vāvaśānā́ḥ (whether pf. or intens.; Kü 488 [and Schaeffer by omission] favor the former) serves as predicate. However, both Ge and Re supply a verb of motion, presumably on the basis of initial ā́: “her(kommen)” and “ar(rivent).” This is of course possible. Both Ge and Re also take the part. vāvaśānā́ḥ as belonging to the pf.

of √vaś ‘desire’, whose participle is homonymous with that of √vāś: “zusammenverlangend” and “riches en désirs” respectively. Although this cannot be faulted formally, the well-known noise-making quality of rivers (embodied in the very word nadī́-) provides a more vivid image and, on the other hand, it is not clear what the rivers would be eager for. 55 On the near-hapax suṣváyanta see my -áya-Formations (52-53), where I argue that the other occurrence of the stem, act. part. suṣváyantī (X.110.6=AV V.27.8) is founded upon this passage and that the form here has been generated in the playful and alliterative context of this vs. (see esp. the following su- adjectives sudúghāḥ sudhārā́ḥ) loosely to suṣū́- ‘well-bearing’, a connection already suggested by Weber (see Old). Such a derivation matches the theme of the rivers’ burgeoning fertility that dominates the vs. ### 07
HvN’s restoration of the pausal form at the end of c as caránti is incorrect; it must be carántī, as the Pp. has it.

Ge suggests that the ‘imperishable’ (ákṣarā), an esoteric designation for ‘cow’, is the Dakṣiṇā, while Sāy. thinks rather of Vāc. In this Marut vs. I wonder if it doesn’t refer to their mother Pṛśni.

For the phrase yújyam … rayím see VIII.46.19.

The nom. pl. té is very oddly positioned, in the middle of both clause and pāda, breaking up the NP yújyam … rayím, and not even adjoining the caesura. I have no explanation.
