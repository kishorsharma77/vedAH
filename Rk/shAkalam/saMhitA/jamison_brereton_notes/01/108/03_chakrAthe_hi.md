The signature word of this vs. is sadhryàñc- / sadhrīcīná- ‘joint(ly), conjoined’, which occurs prominently in the first three pādas. The final pāda is dense with phonological and etymological play: vṛ́ṣṇaḥ … vṛṣaṇā́vṛṣethām.

Ge (explicitly) and Re / Klein (DGRV I.373) / WG (all implicitly) take vṛtrahaṇā in b as a predicate vocative (so, “you two, conjoined, are Vṛtra-smashers”).

I would prefer this interpretation, but think that the lack of accent should be taken seriously. Moreover, given the repetition of sadhryàñc- / sadhrīcīná- just noted, it may be that the conjunction of Indra and Agni is what is being highlighted, not their Vṛtra-smashing.
