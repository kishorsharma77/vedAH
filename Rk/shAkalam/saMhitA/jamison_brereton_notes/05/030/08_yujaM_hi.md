Though this vs. follows thematically on vs. 7, it seems disjointed and has given rise to much discussion (see esp. Old and his skepticism about Ge’s interpr.; Bl RR) and incompatible interpretations, which I will not treat in detail further here.

The first question that arises is who is the 1st

-ps. speaker in pāda a. Ge
suggests that it is Namuci himself, a suggestion rejected by both Old and Bl. I think the root aor. ákṛthāḥ is the clue. It is rare that the aorist, esp. the root aorist, is used as a narrative tense, esp. to a root well outfitted with other preterital possibilities. I take pāda a as a parenthetical interruption of the Namuci story, prompted by the last pāda of vs. 7, esp. the mention of Manu. With Old I take “me” as referring to the present-day priest, and in my view he is asserting his ancestral and vocational connection with the primal priest and representative Ārya, Manu. The speaker suggests that Indra’s current partnership with him (“for you have made me your yokemate” with the aorist of the recent past) is evidence of Indra’s active concern for his ancestor Manu in the mythological past. After this interruption ā́d íd functions as a resumptive expression, returning us to and carrying on the story of the myth narrated in 7cd.

In 8c the referent of the “whizzing stone” (áśmānam … svaryàm) is disputed.

I very much doubt that it is a mountain, despite the occurrence of the same expression in V.56.4, where it definitely is a mountain, and despite Old’s championing of this identification. I think it more likely that the phrase resonates with I.32.2 vájraṃ svaryàm, where svaryà- refers to Indra’s mace. Namuci’s whirling head is being compared to a weapon whirling through the air and making a whizzing sound.

The “rolling, whirling” image is carried further in the next pāda, with the simile “(rolling forth) like two wheels.” The simile makes fine sense with vártamāna-, but what are the two world-halves (ródasī) doing there? As it turns out, though it may seem counter-intuitive in real-world terms, the two worlds (under various designations) are regularly associated with the root √vṛt (cf., e.g., V.43.2, VI.8.3, VII.80.1, VIII.6.5). In some of these passages the rolling out of the two worlds is part of a cosmogonic exercise; in some it refers to the visual (re- )appearance of differentiated earth and sky at dawn.

I have no idea what the Maruts are doing here.
