The first half-vs. treats the kinship we share with the Aśvins, a theme occasionally touched on elsewhere (e.g., VIII.73.12 adduced by Ge). The grammatical problem in the hemistich is the (pseudo-)root noun cmpd. bandhupṛ́ch-, which has been interpr. both actively (“asking about [their] kinship”: Gr, Ge [/WG], Lü 526, Scar 328-29) and passively (“asked about [their] kinship”: Re). I have followed the Re path, on the assumption that it is more likely that humans are asking the Aśvins about it than that the Aśvins are wondering about it themselves. But in general I prefer root noun compounds to have active meaning, and it is possible that the majority position is the correct one. It does not seem to have too much effect on the interpr. of the rest.
