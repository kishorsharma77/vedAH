mártān is almost surely an irregular gen. pl., rather than the acc. pl. it appears to be. (Though “knowing the races of the gods and (knowing) the mortals” is possible, the tight formulaic connection between gods and men/mortals throughout the RV strongly favors the gen. pl.) Whether it is an archaism or is simply following the morphologically sketchy lead of sthātā́m … caráthām in vs. 3 cannot be determined.
