On nā́yám see VIII.2.28. After my reexamination of the evidence (Hock Fs., 2013) I would now rephrase the translation of the first three pādas as “Drive here, most powerful Indra, to the somian honey to drink it, as bounteous one, all on your own,” eliminating “to the landing site” and construing áchā with mádhu … somyám in the preceding pāda.

A new clause begins with śṛṇávat in the middle of c. Ge takes all of cd together, but the accentuation of śṛṇávat is unexplained in this interpretation.

Moreover áchā is not otherwise found with √śru but is common with √yā.
