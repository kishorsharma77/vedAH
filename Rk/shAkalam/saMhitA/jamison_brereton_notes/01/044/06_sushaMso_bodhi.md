All standard tr. take suśáṃsa- in an active sense (e.g., Ge “der …Schönes sagt”) with the singer the recipient of Agni’s good speech. Certainly when applied to mortals, this has to be the sense, but when applied to gods I take the adj. in passive sense ‘good to proclaim/laud’, with here the singer in the dat. (gṛṇaté) as the agent of the praising.
