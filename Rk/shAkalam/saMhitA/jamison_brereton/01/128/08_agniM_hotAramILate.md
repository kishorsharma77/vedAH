Agni, the Hotar, the depository of goods do they reverently invoke; the  dear, most conspicuous one they have installed as the spoked wheel  
(of the sacrifice)—they have installed as the conveyor of oblations— the one who provides all lifetimes and all possessions, the Hotar  
deserving the sacrifice, the sage poet.  
The gods, seeking goods, (have installed) the lusty one, for help—seeking  goods (they have installed) the lusty one with hymns.
