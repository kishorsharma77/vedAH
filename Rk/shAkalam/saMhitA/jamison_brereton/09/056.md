Soma Pavamāna
Avatsāra Kāśyapa
4 verses: gāyatrī
The first three verses of this simple hymn describe Soma’s journey in the filter (vs.  1), as the liquid separates into multiple streams in the channels of the fleece (vs. 2),  and his preparation by the fingers (vs. 3). The fourth verse then requests protection  for ourselves and our men, while urging the soma to flow for its divine recipients.
## 1
Swift Soma, as lofty truth, rushes about in the filter,
smashing apart the demons, seeking the gods,
## 2
When Soma rushes toward the prize, as a hundred hardworking streams, entering fellowship with Indra.
## 3
The ten young women have cried out to you, like a maiden to her lover. You are groomed, o Soma, for winning.
## 4
You, o drop, the sweet one—flow around for Indra, for Viṣṇu.
Protect the superior men, the praisers from difficult straits.
