The idiom áva √yā ‘placate, appease’ found in 4b finds a close variant in 5c áva yakṣva ‘placate through sacrifice’ to áva √yaj. Though belonging to different roots, they are phonologically and semantically similar. Another such variant is found in d vīhí mṛḷīkám “pursue his grace,” which echoes 3d mṛḷīkám … vidaḥ “you (will) find grace” -- again two different roots (vī and vid) but phonologically and semantically similar.
