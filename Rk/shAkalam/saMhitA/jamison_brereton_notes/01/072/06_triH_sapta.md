The Pp. reads unaccented avidan, but accented ávidan should be extracted from the ambiguous sequence padā́vidan.

As often with RVic numerology, the identity of the three times seven secret padā́is not clear. Ge tr. padā́as Wörte (sim. Re), which is certainly possible and has parallels (see Ge’s disc. in n. to 6ab), but the padé paramé that figured significantly earlier in the hymn (2d, 4d) should be kept in mind. Moreover, in the next vs. Agni is said to be “inwardly knowing the roads (ádhvanaḥ) leading to the gods” (7c), and since the padā́were found in Agni here, it may be that these padā́are tracks and identical to the ádhvanaḥ that he inwardly knows. As I argued in the publ. intro., I think the padā́are the “tracks” of the ritual.

What amṛ́tam refers to is also unclear; it could be, as Sāy suggests, Agni, or simply “immortality, the immortal principle” (so Re). It unfortunately cannot be the body, which is fem. Note the “way towards immortality” (amṛtatvā́ya gātúm) in 9b below. The phrase sthātṝ́n caráthaṃ ca with its number mismatch shows Parāśara’s fondness for this merism (I.66.9, 68.1, 70.3, 7) and the grammatical anomaly found in most of the occurrences in his oeuvre; see disc. ad locc.
