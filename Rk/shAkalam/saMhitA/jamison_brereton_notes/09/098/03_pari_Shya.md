The transmitted akṣā at the end of pāda a before i- should have appeared as akṣār in sandhi; the Pp. reads akṣār íti. Wackernagel (AiG I.1.334-35) considers it a misunderstanding of original akṣāḥ by the redactors.

The simile in d has the same structure as the one in 2b: gapped nominative target whose identity is signalled by an adjunct, in this case bhrājā́‘with flame (/flash/light)’ - most likely pointing to Agni (Ge, Re [tr.], Ober [II.56]), though possibly Sūrya, who is also associated with forms of the root √bhrāj (alt. given by Re in his n.).
