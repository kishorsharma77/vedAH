Although the adverb avár ‘downward’ occurs only here, beside more common avás, it is probably not the result of secondary alteration of avás-, since it has an Old Aves. correspondent auuarə̄(Y. 29.11).

The accent on dādṛhí must be owing to its juxtaposition with immediately following śrudhí.

ápūruṣaghna- is universally taken as ‘not smashing men’, and this is certainly possible. However, since the focus of this composite hymn is on Indra’s destruction of various demonic beings, I think an interpr. ‘smashing non-men’ fits better. The context remains violent, so remarking on Indra’s forebearance towards men would break the martial mood.
