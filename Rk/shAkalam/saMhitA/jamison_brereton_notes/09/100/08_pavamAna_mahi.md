This vs. has nothing in common with its match, vs. 2, until the end, where the two d pādas are identical: víśvāni dāśúṣo gṛhé “all (things) in the house of the pious man.” The two pādas are adapted to two very different themes: in 2 ‘all’ modifies vásūni ‘goods’ (c), which Soma will make flourish in the house of the pious, whereas in 7 the context is darker: ‘all’ modifies támāṃsi ‘dark shades’, which Soma smashes away in the same location.
