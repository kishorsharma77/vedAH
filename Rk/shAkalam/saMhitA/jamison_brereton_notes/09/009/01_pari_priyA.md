víśvā yád rūpā́pariyā́ti “when he makes the circuit of all his forms …,” as Ge points out (n. 1b). The journey around the filter must be meant.

The two ‘granddaughters [/nieces]’ (loc. du. naptyòḥ) are, in the ritual context, most likely either the two pressing boards (Sāy, Ge) or the two hands of the priest (Re). Because of the similarity between this vs. and 10.2, I favor the latter because of the gábhastyoḥ ‘in the two hands’ of 10.2b. In a cosmic context, the dual could refer to Heaven and Earth, who are identified as Soma’s two mothers (by most interpr.) in 3. The kinship flip -- Soma and his two granddaughters [/nieces] here, Soma and his two mothers in 3 -- would not doom this identification, given the RVic poets’ love of paradox, esp. the paradox of generations.

The ppl. hitáḥ with which naptyòḥ is construed is ambiguous, between √hi ‘impel’ and √dhā ‘place’. Though both Ge and Re favor the latter, I opt for the former on the basis of hitáḥ in 4a and hinvānā́saḥ in the parallel vs. 10.2a, both clearly belonging to ‘impel’.

Either is possible, however; ‘placed’ would weakly favor the ‘pressing boards’ interpr. of naptyòḥ.
