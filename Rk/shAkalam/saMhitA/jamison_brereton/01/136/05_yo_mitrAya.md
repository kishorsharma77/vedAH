The person who has done honor to Mitra and Varuṇa, that unassailable  one do you two protect all around from difficult straits—the pious  
mortal from difficult straits.  
Him Aryaman guards, him who aims straight following his commandment, him who with hymns tends to the commandment of these two—with  praises tends to their commandment.
