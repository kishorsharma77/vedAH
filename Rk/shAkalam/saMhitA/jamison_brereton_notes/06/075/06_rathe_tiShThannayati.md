Both hemistichs of this vs. express the same paradox, that an entity behind can lead something in front of it. In ab the good charioteer (suṣārathíḥ) “leads forward” (nayati … puráḥ) the horses that are physically in front of him; in cd the reins, which stretch in front of the charioteer from his hands, follow his mind, which is physically behind them (mánaḥ paścā́d ánu).
