I take tásmāt as referring to the unnamed weapon, coreferential with yáḥ in the rel. cl., and ascribe its ablative form to case attraction to infinitival sámṛteḥ.

The weapon is probably the śáru- ‘arrow’ associated with the Ādityas in VIII.18.11, 67.15, 20, as Ge notes. It might therefore have been better to tr. yáḥ in pāda a as ‘which one’ not the animatized ‘who’.
