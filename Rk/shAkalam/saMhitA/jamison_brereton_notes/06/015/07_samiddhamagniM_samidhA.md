This vs. begins a new tṛca, but seems like a mish-mash of the vss. that precede it. The 1st pāda, sámiddham agníṃ samídhā girā́gṛṇe, telescopes vs. 6: agním-agnim … samídhā (a), gṛṇīṣáṇi (b), gī́rbhiḥ (c). It also contains two etymological figures (sámiddham … samídhā and girā́gṛṇe). The next pāda, śúcim pāvakám puró adhvaré dhruvám, is more eclectic in its sources: śúciḥ (1c), pāvakáyā (5a), svadhvarám (4b); pāda-final dhruvám has no direct correspondent, but resonates with both dúvaḥ (pāda-final in 6e) and adrúham, which ends the next pāda (7c). The first two words of pāda c, vípraṃ hótāram have correspondents in 4c and b respectively. Only pāda d breaks significantly new ground.
