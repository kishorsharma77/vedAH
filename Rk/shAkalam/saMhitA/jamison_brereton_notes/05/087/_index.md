Maruts Re nicely characterizes this hymn (in his comm. on vs. 5) “l'hymne est fait de débris empruntés au cycle ancien des M.” Certainly there is a sense that the vss. are constructed of loosely connected phrases, which may well be connected with the unusual meter.

As disc. in the publ. intro., the final word of the 2nd pāda of each vs., evayā́marut, appears to be an exclamatory internal refrain without syntactic connection to the rest of the vs. Ge by contrast takes it in each case as forming a nominal sentence with unexpressed Viṣṇu (usually, but see below): “(Viṣṇu is der) mit dem die Marut gern kommen.” But though Viṣṇu is surprisingly prominent in this hymn, I don’t think he outranks the Maruts, and the formation of evayā́marut is too peculiar to be folded into a conventional (if invisible) nominal clause. Though sg., I think it must refer to the Maruts, who, after all, appear in the collective sg. in the rest of the vs. (pādas cde) as a troop (śárdha-). For the phrase on which this is built, see V.41.16 evayā́marutaḥ.
