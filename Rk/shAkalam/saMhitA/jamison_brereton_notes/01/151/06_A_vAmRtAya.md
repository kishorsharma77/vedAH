Pāda-final gātúm árcathaḥ seems to echo likewise pāda-final gātúm árcata in 2c, but in fact, at least according to me and the other standard tr., the similarity is misleading. In our passage gātúm is surely the object of du. pres. árcathaḥ, but in 2c gā́túm is better taken as the object of the preceding verb vidatam, and árcata in sandhi before utá, which opens the next pāda, is better taken as having the underlying form árcate (so Pp.), the dat. sg. act. participle, rather than du. injunc. árcataḥ, which is technically possible. This teasing but false superimposibility seems the opposite of “poetic repair” -- “poetic breakage” perhaps?
