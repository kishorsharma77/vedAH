The identity of these sons as the gods is clear from deváputre in 1c: ‘the two [=Heaven and Earth] having the gods as sons’.

The referent of the son in d is disputed. Sāy (followed by WG) takes it as the sun, on the basis of I.160.1; Ge as “jedes lebende Geschöpf”; Re as the human son. I suggest rather that it is Agni. In 2 of the other 3 occurrences of ádvayāvin- it modifies hótar- (III.2.15, VII.56.18), and in at least one (III.2.15) it's clearly Agni.

It's also the case that Agni is frequently associated with padá-. The hemistich may convey that Heaven and Earth protect the general world of reality (c) and the specific world of the ritual (d). I think it esp. unlikely that it is the Sun here, because of the complementary relationship between I.159 and I.160, with the latter being the realm of the Sun. See publ. intro. to I.160.
