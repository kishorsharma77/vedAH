Since the yé of the rel. clause in ab has no obvious referent in the main clause of cd, it is tempting to connect ab with the preceding verse (12), and start a new sentence with 13cd -- esp. because 13a yé pāyávaḥ matches 12c té pāyavaḥ so exactly. But vs. 13 is a repeated vs. (= I.147.3), and so must be interpreted as selfcontained. It is also likely, because of the reference to Māmateya, i.e., Dīrghatamas, that I.147, a Dīrghatamas hymn, is its source, and the vs. has been inserted here secondarily because of the match between the two pāyávaḥ phrases (so Bloomfield, RR ad I.147.3). On the relationship between the relative and main clauses in this vs. see comm. ad I.147.3.
