Indra  
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
Another hymn bursting with Agastya’s tricks, here especially in the realm of daring  syntax and deliberate omission of key words. The hymn celebrates Indra’s great deeds,  especially his victories over multiple named and unnamed opponents. Allusions to374 I.174  
the Vr̥tra myth and the release of the waters recur throughout the hymn (vss. 2, 3,  9), though the name Vr̥tra is mentioned only once (vs. 2). The first verse urges Indra  to “guard the gods,” and he appears in that role as protector of Agni and his ritual  activities (vs. 3) and enforcer of the norms of Ārya society, as embodied in the three  principal Ādityas (vs. 6). Others who break the Ārya social contrast—the impious, the  godless, the speakers of scorn, and the breakers of alliances (vss. 2, 6, 7, 8)—also fall  victim to Indra as enforcer. Thus, though the tone is martial, the message is moral.  
Two separate devices structure the hymn. On the one hand, the vocative indra (always to be read trisyllabically) appears in the first pāda of every verse immedi ately after the caesura. On the other hand, there is ring composition: the first and  last (10) verses name Indra as “giver of victorious power” and “protector of men,”  while verse 2 has numerous echoes in verses 7–9.
