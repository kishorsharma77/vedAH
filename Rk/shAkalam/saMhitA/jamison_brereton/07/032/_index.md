Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi (1–25), Śakti Vāsiṣṭha (26ab), Vasiṣṭha or Śakti Vāsiṣtha  (26cd–27)
27 verses:  br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, except dvipadā virāj 3, arranged in  pragāthas
This final hymn in the VIIth Maṇḍala Indra cycle is a loose collection of pragāthas,  the first of which has a two-pāda extension (vs. 3). Even within the verse pairs there  is little cohesion. But there is a unifying theme that runs throughout: Indra’s gener ous giving and our grateful receiving, to an extent unusual even in an Indra hymn.  Moreover, it is not only Indra’s giving that we seek: it is repeatedly emphasized that  Indra helps and gives to mortals who themselves give, that is, the patrons of the  sacrifice (see, e.g., vss. 7, 8, 10, 15).
The hymn opens (vs. 1) with the preoccupation that has been visible in many  Indra hymns in VII, the fear that rival sacrificers may attract Indra to their own  rituals, and Indra’s epithet “invoked by many” appears several times (vss. 17, 20,  26). Much of the hymn is concerned with defining the type of ritual behavior that  will cause Indra to choose one sacrifice over another.
Indra is supreme in this hymn. In its twenty-seven verses there is only one men tion of another divinity, the Maruts in verse 10.
