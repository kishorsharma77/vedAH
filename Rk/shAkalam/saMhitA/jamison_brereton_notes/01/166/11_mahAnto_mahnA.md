I have not rendered the y√© in b because in this verb-less string of nominal qualifiers it is difficult to decide where the relative clause ends and the main clause begins. (Both Re and WG take d as the main cl.; Ge seems to take it as cd, insofar as I can interpret his punctuation.) Alternatively, the whole vs. could be a relative clause hanging off vs. 10, or more specifically 10d. This structure would support the change of person in 10d seen by most tr., as opposed to my interpr., for which see immed. above.
