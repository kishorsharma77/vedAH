Ge, Re, Ober (II.54) take ándhaḥ as nom., parallel to dhā́rā in the simile.

But insofar as it is possible to narrow the referent of this word, it is used of the stalk of the soma (see comm. ad IV.1.19). I take it here as acc., construed with áti. This pāda, like the following one, depicts the soma juice leaving behind the solid parts of the plant, and áti ‘beyond’ is used in both pādas to express the material beyond which the soma juice has gone.

The simile in d, átyo ná krīḷan, is also found in 26d.
