This vs. has elicited an extraordinary amount of discussion and disagreement, which cannot be fully rehearsed here. I will only sketch my own interpr., which is closest to Old’s. I take the ā́vaḥ that opens the verse as the verb of the main clause and the only surface word of that clause. The obj. ‘him’ (*tám), referent of the following rel. prn., has been gapped, exactly as in 3c. The cmpd. sānuṣák in b I analyze as sā́nu-ṣác- (rather than sa-ānuṣák- with Gr and others); it is a reference to soma, which famously grows in the mountains. For detailed disc. of the cmpd and the passage see Scar (594), though I cannot follow his suggestion that the 2nd member belongs to √sañj ‘hang’ and refers to a quiver ‘hanging on the back’.

In d the publ. tr. “helped him to prizes” goes a little too fluently into English.

The loc. vā́jeṣu might better be taken as the usual truncated loc. absol. “when prizes (were at stake).” Most other tr. take c with ab, with d separate, whereas I attach c to d. There is no way to tell, but I think the contrast set up here is between the ritual (signalled by the loc. arkéṣu “at the chants”), where Indra will receive what he wants (soma), and the contest (ājaú), where Indra’s client will do so.
