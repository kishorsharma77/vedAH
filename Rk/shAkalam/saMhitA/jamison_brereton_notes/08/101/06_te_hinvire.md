The identity of the three mothers of Agni, the likely referent of the acc. phrases in ab, isn’t clear. Ge suggests the three Opfergöttinen (Iḍā, Sarasvatī, Bharatī) of the Āprī hymns. Agni is called trimātár- in III.56.5, but the three are not identified there either. Since our vs. is the 2nd vs. in a pragātha whose 1st vs. concerns the Ādityas, esp. Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman, I am inclined to think that these three male deities have been slotted into the “three mothers” role just here because of the coincidence of the numbers.

The Pp reads masc. nom. pl. amṛ́tāḥ in c, and Ge so tr. (“Die unbetörten Unsterblichen beobachten das Tun der Sterblichen”). Against the Pp I take it as neut.

pl. amṛ́tā; the sandhi situation allows either, of course. Ge’s tr. assumes that the dhā́māni belong to mortals, but wherever it's possible to tell, dhā́man- is something belonging to gods. Cf. also III.55.10 dhā́māni amṛ́tā.
