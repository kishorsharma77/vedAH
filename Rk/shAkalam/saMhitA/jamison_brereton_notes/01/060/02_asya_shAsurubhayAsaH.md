diváś cit pū́rvaḥ is standardly taken as temporal “before day(break),” but this case form of div/dyu is more often spatial than temporal (note diváś cid … bṛhatáḥ in the immediately preceding hymn, 59.5), and pū́rva- + ABL. has a spatial sense elsewhere in just this ritual context: e.g., X.53.1 ní hí ṣátsad ántaraḥ pū́rvo asmát “for he [=Agni] will sit down (as Hotar) close by, in front of us.” Cf. also II.3.3 mā́nuṣāt pūrvaḥ.
