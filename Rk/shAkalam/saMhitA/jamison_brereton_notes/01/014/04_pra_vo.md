Acdg. to Gr, mádhvaḥ is a nom. pl. masc. adj., modifying drapsā́ḥ. But it is surely a gen. sg. of the neut. noun: “drops of honey” (so also, e.g., Ge). Note the identical form in 7c, which has to be a gen. sg., varying with mádhoḥ, also gen. sg., in the flg. vs. (8c) in the same metrical position. In fact, no exx. of mádhvaḥ identified as m. or f. nom. or acc. pl. are secure; they can all be interpr. as the gen. sg.

of the noun. See further disc. ad IX.89.3.
