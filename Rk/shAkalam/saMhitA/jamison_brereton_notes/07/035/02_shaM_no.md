In a and c the provider of luck is śáṃsaḥ ‘Laud’, a clear play on the ubiquitous śám. In c śáṃsaḥ is the head of a NP with dependent gen.: satyásya suyámasya.

In d Ge renders purujātáḥ as “der viele Nachkommen hat,” but given the form of this cmpd., this can hardly be correct. Cmpds. of the shape puru-PAST PPL (+ACCENT), like frequent puru-ṣṭutá-, puru-hutá-, mean ‘much Xed’ or ‘Xed by many’, and in cmpds. with jāta- as 2nd member, -jāta- means ‘born, generated’ not ‘offspring’. Re, who tr. “aux nombreuses naissances,” suggests that Aryaman is so qualified because of his association with marriage.
