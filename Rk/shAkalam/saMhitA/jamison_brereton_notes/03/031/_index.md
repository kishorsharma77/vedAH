Indra As indicated in the publ. intro., the hymn presents multiple difficulties, esp.

in its first three vss. I will not attempt to represent the many conflicting interpr. of these vss., but simply lay out some parts of my own and point to some of the many puzzles that remain. As also noted in the publ. intro., I think the cosmic incest theme imposed on these vss. by others is faint at best, and also think that the ritual occasion depicted is not the original generation of the ritual fire but the removal of the Āhavanīya fire from the Gārhapatya.

In the publ. intro. I say that Indra is not named in the narrative of the Vala myth until vs. 11, but this is false: the last word of the 1st verse of the Vala treatment, 4d, is índraḥ. He is also named in the last vs. of the Vala section, 11b -- thus producing a satisfying ring.

Vss. 3 to the end are tr. and discussed by H.-P. Schmidt in Bṛhaspati und Indra (pp. 166-75).
