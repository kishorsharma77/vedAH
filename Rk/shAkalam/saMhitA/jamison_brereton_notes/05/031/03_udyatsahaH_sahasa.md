Ge and WG take sáhaḥ as the only subj. of ájaniṣṭa, while I take sáhaḥ as an appositive qualifying the unexpressed subj. índraḥ. Again the difference is minor, but I favor my interpr. because the birth of Indra and the prodigous feats he performs immediately thereafter are frequent topics in the RV.
