The gen./abl. form of diváḥ and pṛthivyā́ḥ is somewhat surprising, but, with Old, it is best to assume they depend on kvà. Although the ná separating them is also somewhat surprising, it is possible to take it as a real simile particle rather than a bleached connective (Re’s “aussi bien que…”). Since the point of this tṛca is the anxiety occasioned by the Maruts’ absence from our sacrifice, the poet worries that the Maruts have disappeared to some other sacrificer on earth as definitively as if they had gone off to heaven.

In the simile in c, “in a pasture” is supplied on the basis of the formula √RAN gā́vo ná yávase (V.53.16, etc.). Note that the expected yávase shows up below in 5a, in a slightly off-kilter simile. This might be taken as “poetic repair” (see Jamison 2006: Paris poetics), but simultaneously “de-repair,” in that it introduces an element from one verbal complex into another, where it is unexpected.
