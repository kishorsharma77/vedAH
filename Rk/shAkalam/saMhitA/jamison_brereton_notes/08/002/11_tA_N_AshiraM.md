It is a little odd to command Indra to undertake the sacrificial preparations that are really our job. Presumably once again (see VIII.1.19) Indra is conceived of as the indirect agent: by coming to our sacrifice he sets our preparations in motion, and our impetus for this preparation is the knowledge that he has riches to distribute.
