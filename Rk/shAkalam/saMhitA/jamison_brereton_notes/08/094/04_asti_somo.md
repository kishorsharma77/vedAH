The opening of this vs. seems unnecessarily over-annunciatory, with both ásti and ayám, each equivalent to “here is.” One would have been enough.

There is some dissension about the referent of svarā́jaḥ, which cannot, of course, modify the (dual) Aśvins. Gr, flg. Ludwig, takes it as a gen. sg. referring to soma. The stem modifies the Maruts in V.58.1, and as a nom. pl. could match marútaḥ in b, except that the utá is then wrongly placed. Ge and Old are surely right that it refers to the Ādityas (as in VII.66.6), who appear individually in the next vs. and who are esp. associated with vratá’s, mentioned already in vs. 2. Klein (DGRV I.439), however, essentially rejects this solution for reasons that aren’t clear to me and calls the issue “unresolved.”
