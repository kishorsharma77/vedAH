The poet seems to get a certain pleasure out of using semi-exotic verb forms that masquerade as something else: in pāda a yā́n, the nom. sg. pres. part. of √yā ‘drive’, not the acc. pl. m. of the rel. prn.; in c rhyming ayām̐(< ayān < *ayāṃst), 3rd sg. s-aor. to √yam. There is also the abl. inf. étoḥ in b.

The creatures that the hapax ahyárṣu- (‘snakes-stickers’, Ge (/WG), Falk ‘Schlangenspiesser’, Re ‘qui picquent les serpents’) refers to cannot be determined for certain. The consensus is that it is some kind of bird of prey; Ge suggests (n. 3c) the Schlangenadler. Indeed, the short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus) is widespread in India and feeds mainly on snakes (so Wikipedia). The internet (including You Tube) has some remarkable photos and videos of this bird fighting with, swallowing, and feeding its young with snakes, including cobras. The photos with sizable lengths of snake dribbling out of their mouths and esp. the video of one wolfing down a still wriggling spectacled cobra certainly testify to the greed or avidity of these birds. Whether they stop hunting at evening I have no idea.
