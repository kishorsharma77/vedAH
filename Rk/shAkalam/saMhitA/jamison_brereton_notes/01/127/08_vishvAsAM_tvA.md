This verse begins straightforwardly enough but its syntax deteriorates (or gets more convoluted) towards the end.

The three-member cmpd. satyágirvāhas- in c is implicitly analyzed by Ge as satyágir-vāhas- (“ihn den wahrhafte Reden anziehen”; sim. WG), but, on the one hand, gírvāhas- is an established bahuvrīhi (8x; “whose vehicle is songs” -- that is, the god [Indra] who is conveyed to the sacrifice by the songs dedicated to him) and, on the other, satyá- never modifies gír- as far as I can tell. Old (SBE) tr. “who truly art carried by prayers as by a vehicle,” with the correct internal structure, in my opinion. My “trusty” for satyá- may be pushing the term a bit, but the idea is that the song-vehicle is real and so a trustworthy conveyance.

The ca in f is generally rendered ‘also’, and it is one of only three examples (out of approx. 1100) of ca to which Klein (DGRV I.212-13) attributes that value.

None of the examples is strong, and all can be interpreted with functional values more commonly found with ca. In this case I think amī́ca víśve amṛ́tāsaḥ is conjoined with a gapped vayám ‘we’, as in exx. like VII.88.3 ā́yád ruhā́va váruṇaś ca nā́vam “When [I] and Varuṇa boarded the boat …,” though with pl. rather than sg.

1st ps. gapping. The 1st ps. pl. is found in the opening verb of the verse havāmahe, and although some pādas intervene, that main verb still has domain over the whole verse (save for the last pāda), with ef a rel. cl. attached to that main clause. True, the verb in this rel. clause must also be supplied. I suggest a medial form of √dhā, meaning ‘acquire’; see in fact dhīmahi in this meaning in 5a -- all that is needed is an accent.

For the identical VP váyas- + med. √dhā in this same hymn cycle, cf. I.136.2 áthā dadhāte … váyaḥ “then they two [=Mitra and Varuṇa] acquire vigor,” and for a 1st pl.

in this collocation (including the instr.) see II.23.10 tváyā vayám uttamáṃ dhīmahe váyaḥ “Through you might we acquire the utmost vigor.” In nearby I.141.13 (though not a Paruchepa hymn) amī́ca is overtly conjoined with vayám, as I suggest is covertly the case here: amī́ca yé maghávāno vayáṃ ca “those who are our patrons and we (ourselves) …” As for pāda g, which also lacks a verb, my publ. tr. assumes an active imperatival form of the same root √dhā, addressed to Agni. Agni quite regularly participates in such collocations; in this case the verb might well be the imperativally used root aor. injunctive dhāḥ or else the redupl. pres. impv. dhehi. This short pāda blends two constructions: “set oblations among LOC” and “establish vigor for DAT,” both with √dhā. For the first, with Agni as subject, see, e.g., V.14.1 havyā́devéṣu no dadhat; for the second, likewise with Agni as subject, see, e.g., II.4.9 smát sūríbhyo gṛṇaté tád váyo dhāḥ “establish this vigor for the singer along with his patrons.” Since in our passage the recipients of the váyas- have already been identified in the previous pāda ([us] and all the immortals), the dative recipient with the second construction need not be specified. A more literal tr. of my understanding of this pāda might then be “(place) the oblations among the gods and (establish) vigor,” but this seemed too clotted for the publ. tr.

The trick of this tag-pāda then is that the final ā́váyaḥ is twice the object of an unexpressed form of the root √dhā, but with two different valences. Unusually for tag-pādas, g is not syntactically parallel to f.
