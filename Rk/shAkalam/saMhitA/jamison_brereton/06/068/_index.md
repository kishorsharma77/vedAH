Indra and Varuṇa
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 9–10
The theme of ritual reciprocity dominates here, with praise of the two dedi cands fairly spare, whether individual or joint. The message is simple: the piously performed sacrifice that we offer to the two gods should be generously rewarded  with wealth.
The sacrifice is announced in the first verse, as an enticement to bring the two  gods here. The praise, such as it is, comes in the next three verses, a series of super latives characterizing them both in verse 2, a contrastive glance at their respective  functions in the second half of verse 3, and an assertion that the two are preeminent  even among the other gods in verse 4. (Verse 4 is also noteworthy for the gendered  description of the gods; female deities are not usually given recognition when the  gods in general are mentioned.)
Wealth is the target of the middle verses (5–8), wealth for priests and patrons  alike. The word rayí “wealth” is prominent in all four verses.
The final verses (9–11) depict the here-and-now of the sacrifice, happening  in real time, as it were, signaled by an occurrence of a form of the annunciatory  near-deictic pronoun (“here is/this here”) in each verse (ayám 9c, imám 10a, idám 11c). The gods are present at our sacrifice and urged to drink the soma formally  announced to them.
