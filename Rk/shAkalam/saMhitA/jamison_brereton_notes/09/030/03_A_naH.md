The idiom ā́√pū ‘attract (X) through purification’ is found here in tmesis (see also 29.6). Here the ā́opening the first two pādas is immediately followed by the accusatives that it, as it were, licenses, while the impv. pavasva appears in the 3rd pāda with dhā́rayā, which is also appropriate in the intrans./reflex. usage of pávate without preverb (see 4ab).

Re points to the contrast (or at least juxtaposition) of nṛ́- (nṛ-sā́hyya-) and vīrá- (vīrá-vant-) here, though I would not follow him in seeing them as expressions of two of the Three Functions.
