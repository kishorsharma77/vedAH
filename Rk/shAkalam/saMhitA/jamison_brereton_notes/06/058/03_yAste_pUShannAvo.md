Pūṣan’s ships (nā́vaḥ) are, to my knowledge, not encountered elsewhere.

But, as noted above vs. 1, I would tentatively connect them and the mission of the Sun (dūtyā́m sūryasya) with his role as psychopomp of the dead. One question is whether there are two sets of ships -- those in the sea and those in the midspace -- or one, with the midspace being configured here as the sea (Ge’s Luftmeer). I subscribe to the latter view.
