The final word in a, enā, is taken as enāḥ by the Pp., a reading followed by Gr, Ge, Old, and Lub; in this interpretation it modifies or doubles (since ena- is a pronominal, not an adjectival demonstrative stem) fem. acc. pl. púraḥ earlier in the pāda. I do not rule this out, but wonder whether it can be the enclitic instr. sg. enā to ayám in the meaning ‘in that way, i.e., how’. See enā ‘thereby’ in V.2.11, in addition to personal uses (‘with him’) in IX.96.2, X.108.3.

Pāda b collects several words that have been prominent in the characterization of Indra earlier in the hymn: ójasā (ójiṣṭham 10d), śaviṣṭha (śavasas pate 6b, śávasā 9c), and śakra (śakra 4a). It is esp. clever that the grammatical identities of the first two terms have been switched: s-stem instr. to superlative and vice versa.

Note that though cd forms a single clause with two different subjects (“all the worlds” and “heaven and earth”), the dual verb rejete agrees with the nearer one, the decomposed dual dvandva dyā́vā … pṛthivī́ca.
