Agni
The Gaupāyanas or Laupāyanas: Bandhu (1), Subandhu (2) Śrutabandhu (3), and  Viprabandhu (4)
4 verses: dvipadā virāj
The Anukramaṇī attributes this hymn’s four verses to four poets, all belonging to  the family of the Gaupāyanas or Laupāyanas. These four poets are brothers in the  Gaupāyana family according to an itihāsa (legend) that is supposed to underlie  X.57–60, although it is unlikely that these R̥gvedic hymns actually refer to this story.  According to the story the second brother, Subandhu, was killed and brought back  to life by the other three. In this hymn, the first and third verses are for protection,  while the second verse, the one attributed to Subandhu, is a more generic call for  wealth. The last verse simply asks for Agni’s favor without being clear what end his  favor should serve. In a general way the hymn thus fits the story of the rescue of  Subandhu, since the verses surrounding his verse concern the idea of rescue. But  such echoes may explain the attribution of the hymn rather than the hymn itself.
