A very cleverly constructed vs., nicely fitted to Dvipadā Virāj meter. Each 5-syl. pāda consists of two words, phonologically and etymologically (or pseudoetymologically) related. There are both repetition of morphological figures and variation on them. All four pādas end with a nom. pl. masc. adj.; the first two pādas end with superlative -iṣṭhāḥ, the third with the phonologically similar, but morphologically distinct -iślā(ḥ), the last with something phonologically distinct (ugrā́ḥ).

Three (a, b, d) of the four pādas contain etymological pairs; in the first two the etymological relation is reinforced by phonological repetition (yā́maṃ yā́(y)iṣṭhāḥ, śubhā́śóbhiṣṭhāḥ. (As for the first, the Saṃh. has yéṣṭhā́ḥ, but the first vowel must be distracted. HvN restore yáyiṣṭhāḥ with short root vowel, but I think yā is more likely.

In neither of the other two occurrences of this stem [V.41.3, 74.8] does the meter establish the quantity of the root syllable.) In the third ex. (pāda d) the etymological relationship is not transparent, but would be available to the audience steeped in derivational morphology: ójobhir ugrā́ḥ. Although c, śriyā́sámmiślā́(ḥ), lacks the etymological connection, it mimics it through alliteration, though it is notable that we have miśLa, not the also attested miśRa, which would match śriyā́better. Another set of three versus one: in three pādas (b, c, d) the first noun is in the instr., but in pāda a it is not. The 2nd pāda is the only one that doesn’t deviate from the various patterns in any regard: it’s an etymological figure, ends with a superlative, begins with an instrumental.

One can also note the reversal of vowels in the root syllables of the word pairs of b and d: u … o versus o … u.
