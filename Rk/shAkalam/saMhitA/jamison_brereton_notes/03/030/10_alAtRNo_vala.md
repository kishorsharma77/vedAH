On alātṛṇá- see comm. ad I.166.7. In this passage though ‘unquiet’ does not seem a normal feature of Vala, it can be applied proleptically, characterizing its opening up in fear of Indra’s blow.

Note the phonetic figure in ab: alā.. vala … vrajo ... vy āra, with -tṛṇ- … - ndr- nestled in the 1st pāda; the d pāda also has phonetic rep.: prāvan vāniḥ.

The standard tr. all supply the Maruts with vā́ṇīḥ ‘choir’. But as Schmidt (B+I 141) points out, the Maruts do not ordinarily participate in the Vala myth; it is the Aṅgirases who are Indra’s back-up band. See III.31.4ff.
