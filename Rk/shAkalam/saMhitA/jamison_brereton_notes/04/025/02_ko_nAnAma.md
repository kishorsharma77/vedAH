The last part of d, kaváye ká ūtī́, is somewhat unclear. Ge, flg. Sāy., identifies the kaví- as Indra, but this seems unlikely. If káḥ refers to the mortal worshiper (as seems likely, given the referents of the preceding káḥ’s), he would not ordinarily be supplying help to Indra, and though Indra is sometimes called a kaví-, that is comparatively rare (though see the next hymn, IV.26.1) and not found in such a context. Other passages with ūtī́and an overt or covert form of the copula (vel sim.) generally have the god as subject. Cf. nearby IV.23.2 … kád ūtī́, vr̥dhé bhuvac chaśamānasya ... “Will he be here with help for the strengthening of the one who has labored” (sim. IV.29.1, 4; 31.1), but as was just noted, changing the referent of káḥ in the middle of this insistent sequence (9 occurrences of káḥ in 3 vss.) is undesirable.

My ‘joins together’ is an awkward attempt to avoid that.
