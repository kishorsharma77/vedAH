The referent and construction of āsu require discussion. Ge (/WG) construe it with prathamáḥ (“first among these”) and supply “cows.” But this doesn’t make sense if the meaning is “desiring to run first among these,” because that conjures up a picture of the horse leading a stampede of cattle in a race -- surely not an ancient Indian sporting event or battle array! If the āsu is to be construed with the rest of its pāda, it should refer to the ranks of chariots in b (śréṇibhī ráthānām): śréṇi- is fem.

and the image appears to be of Dadhikrā leading a charge of chariots, a far more likely scenario. However, I think unaccented āsu is simply taking (modified) Wackernagel’s position in the clause and should be construed with ní veveti in b: the horse is bearing down on the females. (Note that ní veveti … āsu is found also in III.55.9.) Even so, I would not supply ‘cows’: although we are (too) accustomed to having (notional) cows as the goal of a hypermasculine animal in the ever-repeated formulae in Maṇḍala IX, where Soma the bull seeks cows in the form of milk, in fact Dadhikrā should be seeking mares, not cows, if this is about his desire to mate.

However, if he is not seeking mates, but merely prizes, cows will do. (And note cárati góṣu gáchan in 4b, where the cows are explicit.) The sexual reading I suggest for ab may be supported by pāda c, where I follow Gr, Re, and WG (in n.) in taking jánya- as a member of a wedding party, not merely a man ‘belonging to (one’s own) people, Landsmann’. For jánya- in a wedding context, see AV XI.8.1-2. Here the comparison is presumably between the garland of the winner of the race and that of a suitor or groomsman at a wedding.

Ge and Re (EVP 15.163) render kiráṇam as ‘rein’ (Ge Zügel, Re rêne), flg.

Sāy. (āsyagataṃ khalīnam), though Re appears to recant in his n. Neither etymology nor the other occurrences of the word (not so tr. by Ge, e.g.) support this interpr., and context also favors a version of ‘dust’ (so WG ‘Stäubchen’). Note kirate reṇúm “scatters dust” in 7d, where the verb kirate echoes kiráṇa-.
