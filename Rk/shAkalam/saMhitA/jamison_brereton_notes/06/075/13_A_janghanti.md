The first hemistich is strongly alliterative: jaṅghanti … jaghánān … jighnate and plays on two different redupl. verb forms to √han: the intensive and the regular redupl. pres. Although I generally agree with Schaefer that “intensives” are really frequentatives most of the time, in this particular passage the presence of the med. redupl. pres. jighnate, which almost always has pl. objects (as here) and therefore fills the frequentative slot, pushes the intens. stem jaṅghan- towards a true intensive value.

prácetas- ‘discerning’ may seem an odd descriptor for horses, but the point is well captured by Doniger’s “who sense what is ahead” (perhaps an expansion on Re’s [Hymnes spéc.] ‘prévoyant’). The horses are presumably too smart to go into battle unless they’re forced by the whip.
