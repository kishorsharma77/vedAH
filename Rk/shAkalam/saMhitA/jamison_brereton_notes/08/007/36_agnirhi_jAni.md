Pāda b contains two ambiguous forms, whose variant interpretations have produced very different tr.: chándaḥ may be nom. sg. masc. to chánda- ‘pleasing’ (if that stem exists; the only other possible ex. in the RV is at I.92.6, q.v.) or nom./acc. sg. neut. to chándas- ‘meter’; sū́raḥ can be nom. sg. masc. sū́ra- 'sun' or gen. sg.

svàr- 'id.' The standard tr. opt for the former choice in both cases, e.g., Re “tel un charmeur est le soleil, de par (son) éclat.” I have chosen the latter in both cases. The verse is a reference to the ritual here-and-now, the kindling of the fire at dawn: the phrase sū́ro arcíṣā “with the ray of the sun” is an indicator of that time. I take chándaḥ as a metrical verse because the hymn opened with a similar metrical expression: triṣṭúbham íṣam (see comm. ad vs. 1). The Maruts are characterized as chandastúbh- ‘chanting in rhythm’ in V.52.12, a cmpd that unites the chandas- of our vs. 36 with the 2nd part of triṣṭúbh- in vs. 1. To be born “like a metrical verse” makes sense in a RVic context: the fire is kindled (born) as the verbal portion of the ritual begins to be spoken (born).
