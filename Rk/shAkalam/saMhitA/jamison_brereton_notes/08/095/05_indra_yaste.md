The verse consists entirely of a relative clause with no main clause, but the referent of the relative must be Tiraścī of 4a, despite the intervening matter in 4c, as the similar structures of 4b and 5a indicate: # índra yás tvā and # índra yás te respectively.

Note the interplay of návīyasam ‘newer’ and pratnā́m ‘age-old’, expressing the standard RVic poetic trope of making an old song new again. So also Ge (n. to 5cd).
