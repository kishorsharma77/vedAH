In b I read trī́with both dhánva and yójanā (taking both as neut. pl.). The position of the numeral favors taking it with dhánva, which could, however, be singular; in favor of reading the numeral (also) with yójanā is X.86.20 dhánva ca yát krntátram ca, káti svit t ̥ ā́ví yójanā “Wasteland and chasm -- how many yojanas (of distance) are they away (from here).” (Note that dhánva is singular in that passage.)
