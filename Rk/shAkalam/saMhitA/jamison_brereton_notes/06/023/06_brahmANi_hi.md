The first hemistich can be interpr. as a rough repair of the problematic 5a: what Indra holds dear (5a) are the formulations that he makes strengthening for himself (6a), and this is what we have toiled for (6b), with viviṣmaḥ in a syntactically more orthodox position than in 5a. (6a also of course is responsive to 5d.) The phrase opening the 2nd hemistich, suté sóme sutapā́ḥ, echoes 5c, with sut(apā́ḥ) an anagram of stu(masi).

The referent of the acc. pl. neut. adjs. in cd is unspecified; either the pressings or the formulations -- or, better, both -- would work. Both are elsewhere qualified as śáṃtama-: cf. VIII.33.15 sávanā santu śáṃtamā and V.73.10 imā́bráhmāṇi várdhanā … santu śáṃtamā.

A rare ex. of variant readings, the hapax rā́ṇdya-/rā́ndrya- is unclear. Ge refuses to tr. it. The publ. tr. ‘enjoyable’ (which should be marked with ?) rests on Hoffmann’s suggestion (reported in EWA s.v. rā́ṇḍya-), deriving it from √raṇ (or √ram). Certainty of course is impossible, but some such meaning fits the context.

vákṣana- in d serves as a synonymous substitute for várdhana- (5d, 6a).
