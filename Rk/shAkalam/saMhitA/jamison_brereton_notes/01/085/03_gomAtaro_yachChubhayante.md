The pf. dadhire of b is not in harmony with the three pres. forms, śubháyante a, bā́dhante b, rīyate c; in particular, the tenses of the subordinate-main clause dyad in ab clash: “when they beautify themselves …, they have put on …” (The tr. avoids the clash by using simply ‘put’, ambiguous between present and past in English, but the Sanskrit is not so amenable.) It is difficult to wring a stative/resulative meaning (“they have put on and now have on …”) out of dadhire, esp. given the identical form in preterital use in 2d. It may be best to assume that dadhire here just echoes the form in 2d, though it might be worth noting that the 3rd pl. mid. present indicative to the redupl. pres., dádhate, which we might expect here, is quite rare. However, there is another possible solution to this clash. The pres. śubháyante in the yád clause in pāda a appears before vowel-initial añjíbhiḥ in the cadence, with, as is usual, the final

-e scanning short in hiatus (that is, probably as *-ay
). It is possible that the underlying form of the verb was actually the injunctive *śubháyanta and that the primary ending

-ante was substituted editorially to prevent the redactional contraction that might have resulted (*śubháyantāñjíbhiḥ). This would allow a past-time reading of the first
hemistich, “When they beautified themselves …, they put on …”
