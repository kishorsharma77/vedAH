and identical (by most lights) VI.14.1 (I consider that form a nom. sg. part.

bhásan). In response to these problems, Ge (inter alia, going back to Aufrecht [see Old] and cautiously endorsed in EWA s.v. BHAS) interpr. it as a noun bhasátha- ‘the noise of the mouth when eating’ (Ge, das Geräusch des Mundes bes. beim Essen).

But although this solves the accent problems, it creates greater difficulty elsewhere: not only would that stem be a hapax, but Ge’s attempt to fit it into the rest of the clause produces something close to nonsense, whereas a du. verb works well in the clausal syntax. Old and Re wisely opt for the verb (maybe also Gotō 82), the latter without remarking on the accentual problem and the former without suggesting a solution. I also accept it as a verb ‘snap at’ and also lack a solution to the accent. It cannot be attributed to caná, which doesn’t induce verbal accent. Its complement is vádataḥ, which I take as gen. sg., the correlative of yáḥ in the rel. cl. of ab -- with gen. as an alternative to acc. in verbs of consumption (biting counts). As Old points out, it could also be acc. pl., but that would lose the connection with the rel. cl. (Re supplies an acc. obj. on which the gen. depends: “vous ne mordez nullement (les richesses de cet homme) qui dit …,” which seems unnec. and unmotivated.)
