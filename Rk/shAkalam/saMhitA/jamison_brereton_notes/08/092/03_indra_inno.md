What posture abhijñú designates is not clear. Ge thinks it involves bending the knees and sinking down, Scar (345) that Indra crouches down because he is so large. I think rather that, as in I.37.10, it indicates a slightly crouching position, with knees bent, for driving a chariot (note I.37.10 abhijñú yā́tave “abhijñu to drive”), in this case to bring the prizes to us. The word nṛtúḥ ‘dancer’ at the end of b is suggestive, so that abhijñu might instead, or also, be a dancing posture.
