As Bl (RVReps) and Ge point out, this vs. appears to have been constructed from textual blocks found in I.14.12 and I.134.3. Our pāda a yuṅgdhváṃ hy áruṣī ráthe is identical to I.14.12a except for the sg. impv. yukṣvā́hí rather than our pl.

yuṅgdhvám hí. If our pāda is modeled on I.14.12 (or a similar source) it could explain both the hí with no obvious function and the sg. chariot ráthe for the plural Maruts; this mismatch in number is repaired in the next pāda yuṅgdhvám rátheṣu rohítaḥ.

This latter pāda has no close parallels in the RV, though I.14.12b ends with rohítaḥ, which is a further obj. to yukṣvā́in pāda a (I.14.12b haríto deva rohítaḥ) and so may be a distant source. Our 2nd hemistich yuṅgdhváṃ hárī ajirā́dhurí vóḷhave, váhiṣṭhā dhurí vóḷhave closely follows I.134.3bc vāyū́ráthe ajirā́dhurí vóḷhave, váhiṣṭhā dhurí vóḷhave (whose pāda a contains the ‘yoke’ verb: vāyúr yuṅkte …). What I don’t understand is why Śyāvāśva has made these clumsy adaptations just to produce a vs. that in context is just treading water -- there’s no need for a yoking vs. here.

Note that váhiṣṭhā vóḷhave “the two best pullers to pull” is an etymological figure, with both words built to √vah, though it is not at all transparent. Perhaps this is what attracted Śyāvāśva.
