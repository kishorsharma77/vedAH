Both Ge and Re take the hapax avódevam, modifying vácaḥ, as meaning ‘below / inferior to (that of) the gods’. This makes a nice contrast to upárimartyam ‘above (that of) mortals’. However, it otherwise seems an odd sentiment: it is surely a given that anything we mortals produce will be inferior to whatever comes from the gods, but this is a given that we don’t necessarily want to emphasize. In this ritual context the point of our speech is that it should be good enough (better than that of other mortals) to bring the gods to us. Hence something like Gr’s “die Götter herunterholend, sie herablockend” seems preferable (see also Kü 492). The compound itself is a version of, or manipulation of, the reasonably common expression avó divā́/ diváḥ (I.163.6, V.40.6, VIII.40.8, IX.74.6).
