Old (ZDMG 55.301), fld. by Ge and Re, interprets vṛñjé as a t-less 3rd sg.

passive, rather than as the 1st sg. it appears to be. I do not see the necessity for this.

The same VP is found in I.116.1 (… bárhir iva prá vṛñje), where the 1st ps. interpr. is reinforced by the flg. pāda containing the 1st sg. act. iyarmi. Further, in the almost identical pāda VII.2.4 prá vrñjate námas ̥ ā barhír agnaú, the med. 3rd pl. vṛñjate must be transitive with sg. bárhiḥ as obj. The best support (see Old) for a pass. interpr. is that then all 4 pādas in this vs. would begin with a passive (b: áyāmi, c ámyakṣi, d áśrāyi), but in that case we might expect a form more parallel to the other three.

Although √vṛj has no passive aorist attested, there are no morphological or phonological barriers to building *ávarji (cf. the very common ásarji to √sṛj ‘discharge’). I confess I do not understand the sequence of tense, with pres. vṛñjé in the yád clause, followed by 3 main clause augmented aorists, but taking vṛñjé as a passive does not solve this problem.

I do not understand the semantic difference between sádman- and sádana-, if there is one.
