dhīmahi in d is probably has a slight double meaning: we want to acquire Agni like good fortune, but in the technical ritual sense we want to install / establish him. For the technical sense see dádhānaḥ in 13b.

There is also a pun on bhága-, both ‘good fortune’ and the name of the god, a pun continued in the next vs. ### 11
Ge (also Kü 306) takes pāda a separately from b and supplies ‘give’, but this seems entirely unnecessary.

For bhágam √pṛc, see comments ad 6b. bhága- also participates in a nexus with the previous verse: in 10d it appears in a simile, but here it has been promoted to the “real” object to which other entities are compared. In the first hemistich the common noun usage of the stem is dominant, but in the 2nd it is the god Bhaga.

Contrary to Ge (/WG/Kü) but with Old (SBE) and Re, I take dámūnasam as an adj. with rayím rather than as an independent nominal referring to the master of the house (Ge ‘Hausgebieter’).

Note devā́nāṃ śáṃsam here matching mártaṃ śáṃsam in 6d. As there, the object of the verb yámati here involves a zeugma, of animates (the races of gods and men) and the inanimate laud of the gods.

The last clausal tag in d, ṛtá ā́ca sukrátuḥ could simply be taken as a nominal sentence with copula to be supplied (“and he is of good resolve in truth” vel sim.).

However, I supply a passive form of √yam (presumably ppl. yatáḥ) corresponding to the act. subj. yámati of c. Cf., for ṛtá ā́, VI.7.1 r̥tá ā́jātám “born in truth” and, for yatá- + LOC, VIII.92.7 víśvāsu gīrṣv ā́yatam “held in place amidst all your hymns” (also V.44.9). I recognize that this extra material may be unnecessary, however. On the other hand, see comm. on I.144.3 for possible support.
