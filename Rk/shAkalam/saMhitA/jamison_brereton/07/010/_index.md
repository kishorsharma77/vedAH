Agni
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The poet is particularly fond of alliteration and assonance, which he uses exten sively in the hymn. The first words of the first verse uṣó ná jāráḥ echo its last  uśatī́r ajīgaḥ, and throughout the verse the poet pairs initial sounds: pr̥thú pā́jaḥ,  dávidyutad dī́dyat, and bhāti bhāṣā́, in what may be a sonic representation of the  flickering fire repeatedly flaming. In verses 2 and 3 he strings sets of three repeti tions: dravád dūtó devayā́vā (2d) and susaṃdŕ̥śaṃ suprátīkaṃ sváñcam (3c). He then  returns to pairs in verse 4: rudráṃ rudrébhiḥ, ādityébhir áditim. These repetitions  abruptly stop at the last verse, which states matter-of-factly the principal theme of  the hymn first enunciated at verse 2: Agni brings offerings to the gods in heaven and  wealth to mortals on earth. There is a variation on this theme in verse 4, in which  Agni not only conveys oblations to the gods (as in vs. 3), but also conveys the gods  to earth at the sacrificial place.
