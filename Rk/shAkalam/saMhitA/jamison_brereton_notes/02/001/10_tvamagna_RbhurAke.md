On the cadence in pāda a, see comm. ad 3b.

As Old (SBE) already pointed out, the first three pādas refer to the three Ṛbhus and pun on their names: ṛbhú- ‘craftsman / Ṛbhu’ in a, vā́ja- ‘prize / Vāja’ in b, and ví bhāsi ‘you radiate / Vibhvan’ in c.

In c dakṣi is surely a -si impv. to √dah ‘burn’ and should be separated from the identical form in I.141.8, for which see the comm. ad loc. Ge, however, takes dakṣi here to √dakṣ.

The form viśíkṣu- in d is taken by Gr as belonging to the desid. of √śak and meaning ‘gerne Gut austheilend’, which seems unacceptably distant from both the root meaning of √śak and the function of the desiderative. Moreover, √śak is not otherwise attested with ví except, supposedly, in the similar form ví śikṣa IV.35.3 (for which see below). Ge tr. “du bist der Prüfer,” Re “tu es celui que si met à l'oeuvre diversement”; neither discusses the form or its root affiliation, and one can only assume they follow the assignment to √śak, though exactly how is unclear. Old (SBE) suggested an appealing alternative, interpreting it as built to the desid. of √śas ‘cut’, which is primarily found with ví -- an idea I find eminently worthy of revival.

This may also be the view of WG, who tr. “Du bist williger Verteiler,” again without disc., so they may in fact simply reproduce Gr’s understanding of the semantics. Old does not sketch out the morphology, but it presumably rests on *śi-śs-su-, with zerograde root and simplification of the medial sibilant cluster śss arising from the two radical sibilants and the desiderative suffix. The finite verb ví śikṣa in IV.35.3 (also a Ṛbhus context) belongs here as well. Heenen (Desid., 232-33) mentions this possibility though without great enthusiasm (“La possiblité … n’est pas exclue”).

The publ. tr. “seek to carve up and to stretch out the sacrifice” implies that ātániḥ is desiderative. This was not meant, and the tr. should perhaps be emended to “seek to carve up the sacrifice, as the one who stretches it out” or “… as you stretch it out.”
