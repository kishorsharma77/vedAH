Soma Pavamāna  
Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa  
7 verses: gāyatrī  
Like the immediately preceding hymn, this one is less concerned with the details of  the ritual (though they are not absent: the fleece filter, vss. 1, 7; the water and the  cups, vs. 6) than with the ritual economy, where, for example, our thought helps  purify Soma (vs. 3) and he in return finds wealth for the poets, singers, and patrons.  Although most of the phraseology is standard for soma hymns, the image in verse  5 of Soma entering the songs seems to be a deliberate reversal of passages in which  the songs themselves enter a god, and seems also to imitate and vary the numerous  passages in which Soma enters Indra.
