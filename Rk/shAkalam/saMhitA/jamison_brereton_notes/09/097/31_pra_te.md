The skeleton of pāda a, (prá te) dhā́rā (mádhumatīr) asṛgran, is identical to 29a (śatáṃ) dhā́rā (devájātā) asṛgran.

The publ. tr. renders pávase as if it were an imperative; correct to “you purify yourself.” I take “domain of cows” (dhā́ma gónām) in c to indicate that Soma is the substance into which the milk is mixed. Since the milk is sometimes identified as the sun, his swelling of the sun in d may refer to Soma’s providing more body and amplitude to the milk.

As often, arká- can be read as a pun.
