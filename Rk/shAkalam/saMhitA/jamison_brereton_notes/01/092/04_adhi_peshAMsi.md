bárjaha- in b is a hapax, but related to dual barjahyè in AV XI.8.14 in a list of body parts, found between the ribs and the sides. Whitney/Lanman tr. ‘nipples’ there.

The consensus tr. ‘udder’ seems reasonable, esp. on the assumption that usrā́‘ruddy’ designates a cow. However, the purport of the simile is a little unclear. Since cows don’t wear clothes, their udders are not covered to begin with and uncovering is unnecessary. Ge suggests that the simile is proleptic: Dawn’s breast becomes as visible as a cow’s full udder, but this interpretation requires that the verb (‘uncovers’) that should mediate between frame and simile has been semantically elided.

The simile in d is similarly “off,” since cows don’t have the capacity to open their own pens. Macdonell (Hymns from the Rigveda, 1922) tr. “as when cows break from their stalls,” which makes more sense, but again misrepresents the pivotal verb.

The apparently wrong sandhi āvar támaḥ is, as has long been known, an ex. of degemination in context: āvar represents the older 3rd sg. root aor. *āvart. See Old, Prol. 424 n. 1, AiG I.304-5, 336.
