This vs. seems a response, if an indirect one, to the question posed in vs. 1.

The hí, as often, has a higher discourse function: it gives the reason for asking the question in the first place. We could tr. “(I ask) because …” I also consider this vs. a further expression of the “individual/collective” theme I identified in vs. 1, here 80 conveyed by the pl. janū́ṃṣi ‘births’ in the first clause, contrasted with the sg.

janítram ‘means of begetting’ in the 2nd. If 1ab asks “who are they individually?” 2ab states that the question needs to be asked because no one knows their individual births, even though (cd) they [=Maruts] know “mutually” (mitháḥ) their own (individual) means of begetting. In other words, they share the knowledge of their separate births -- something we don’t know. Note the middle vidre: they know facts about themselves, contrasting with the 3rd-party lack of knowledge in ab nákiḥ … véda.
