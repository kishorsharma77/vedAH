Soma and Rudra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
4 verses: triṣṭubh
Although there is another R̥gvedic hymn dedicated to Rudra and Soma (I.43), in  that hymn they are invoked and described in separate verses; this hymn is the only  place in which the two gods are invoked jointly, in a dual dvandva compound that  appears in every verse and is found only in this hymn. Indeed, the gods have little in  common, and the elements in this hymn that are not generic to divinity in general  are applicable only to Rudra—in particular, the plea to destroy disease (vs. 2) and  give healing remedies (vs. 3). The adjective “very kindly” (suśévau) in verse 4 is  etymologically related to and anticipates the epithet śíva “kindly,” which later char acterizes Rudra (already R̥V X.92.9) and ultimately replaces his name.
