As discussed in the publ. intro., this vs. effects a transition from the undefined 3rd ps. sg. “every mortal” (víśvaḥ … mártaḥ) of vs. 1 to a 1st ps. pl.

referring to us. This has been definitively accomplished by pāda d, which opens with the finite 1st pl. sácemahi ‘may we be accompanied’, but earlier in the vs. this plural is carried by the insistent masc. nom. pl. pronominal forms té … yé … té … té. These forms invite a 3rd plural reading (“they … who … they … they”): although the sá/tám pronoun is capable of having both 1st and 2nd ps. reference, 3rd ps. is the default. The first 3 pādas of the vs. cleverly avoid forcing the reference by using predicated dative infinitives (anuśáse … āpṛ́ce), which leave the person unfixed, rather than finite verbs, which would force such a reading of the person. The poet draws attention to his syntactic modulation through the singsong effect of té te de(va) …, yé ca … / té (rāyā́) té (hí āpṛ́)ce, sáce(mahi) saca(thíyaiḥ).

The syntax is further complicated by the parenthetical expression embedded in pāda c, té hy ā̀pṛ́ce.

The thematic continuity with vs. 1, despite the fancy referential footwork, is emphasized by d sácemahi sacathyaìḥ, which echoes sakhyám in 1b.
