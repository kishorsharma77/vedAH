On the meaning of vayúna-, see comm. ad II.34.4.

As has long been known, the RVic desid. stem íyakṣa- belongs to √naś ‘attain’, not (pace Gr) √yaj ‘sacrifice’. See, inter alia, EWA s.v. NAŚ 1 ; Heenen (Desid. 79-82).

The question in the 2nd hemistich seems like a non sequitur, which makes me somewhat sympathetic to Sāy’s reading as a (negative) indefinite: kadā cid “they do not ever violate …” But this reinterpr. is arbitrary, of course, and further, the kadā́ question inaugurates a series of questions in vs. 4, each with a ka- form: a kúha, b kám … kā́su, c káḥ, d káḥ … katamáḥ. It may be that we have to ask about the whereabouts of Indra in vs. 4 because he has ceased to appear to us because we have (or may have) violated his ordinances.
