It is difficult to know what, if anything, is the referent of asya. I have tentatively supplied ‘hymn’, but the poet may simply be calling upon the gods to witness the general situation (so Ge). The same expression √VID me asya is found in the refrain of I.105, except with accented asyá, for which reason I more confidently supply ‘speech’ there.
