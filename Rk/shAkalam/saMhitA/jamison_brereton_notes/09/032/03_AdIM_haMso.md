This vs. contains two similes (ab and c respectively), each a bit trickily constructed.

In the first, the caus. redupl. aor. avīvaśat has two slightly different senses in simile and frame: ‘makes bellow’ in the simile: it is the flock (gaṇám) that is making the noise, stimulated by its lead goose (haṃsáḥ); ‘makes bellow(ed)’ in the frame: it is the thought/prayer (matím) of someone else (víśvasya) that Soma causes to be heard. This double sense is the counterpart to that of the caus. to √śru, both ‘make hear’ and ‘makes heard’. My interpr. here is different from that of Re, who takes both acc. as goal of the sound (“… vers (sa) troupe, … vers la prière …”); Ge’s is close to mine, though he doesn’t seem to recognize the slight difference in the function of the object. On this aor. stem, see my -áya-Formations, 111, 166. Another ex. with the same sense is found in nearby IX.34.6; see comm. ad loc. In the second simile, in c, it is not syntactic variation but a pun on the root of the passive ajyate that is at issue: this form can belong either to √añj ‘anoint’ or to √aj ‘drive’, and both are appropriate to the context. Soma can be “anointed” by cows’ milk or driven together with the cows (that is, the milk). The ‘steed’ to which Soma is compared could likewise be both anointed (/groomed) and driven.
