On the insistent ubhā́see publ. intro.

I have taken āhuvádhyai (and mādayádhyai) as predicated infinitives with the subj. ubhā́, as does Re. However, vām in pāda a makes some difficulties for this interpr., and Ge takes that pāda (but not b) as having an implicit 1st ps. subj.: “euch beide … will ich herrufen” (a) versus “beiden sollen sich … erfreuen” for mādayádhyai (b). I think the two clauses should be parallel and therefore take vām as a dependent gen. on ubhā́(“both of you two”), although it must be admitted that ubhá- generally agrees with its referent in case.
