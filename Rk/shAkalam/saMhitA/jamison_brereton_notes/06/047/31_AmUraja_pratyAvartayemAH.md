Ge explains pāda a persuasively as “Raub und Wiederraub der Kühe,” with the ‘yonder ones’ (amū́ḥ) those belonging to the enemy and the ones here (imā́ḥ) our own.

I do not understand why cáranti is accented. Ge takes it as implicitly subordinated (“Wenn … sich sammeln”), which would account for the accent, but there’s no other evidence for subordination. It could be ascribed to the vague principle that the verb is accented in a clause that provides the basis for the next clause, as Old suggests only to question (ZDMG 60: 725 n. 1 = KlSch. p. 200).
