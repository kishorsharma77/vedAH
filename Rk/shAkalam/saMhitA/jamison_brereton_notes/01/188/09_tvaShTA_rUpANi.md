The double acc. rūpā́ṇi … paśū́n víśvān poses some difficulties. Ge construes rūpā́ṇi with prabhúḥ (“der die Formen bemeistert”). But I know of no other passages in which prabhú- governs an acc., and prabhvī́ḥ in 5a would discourage such an interpr. in any case. X.110, the Āprī hymn most like this one, has in the corresponding vs. rūpaír ápiṃśad bhúvanāni víśvā, with an instr. of rūpá-. In both cases I think the rūpá- further specifies the primary object, in this case “all the beasts”: it is their forms he is anointing.

The logical sequence in this vs. is broken in Ge’s tr. because of his use of abstract vocab. for concrete notions: “hat … fertiggemacht” for samānajé ‘anointed’ and “Gedeihen” for sphātím ‘fat’. Surely the point is that the addressee of c (probably Agni or the Hotar, with Ge) is urged to win the fat that Tvaṣṭar used to anoint the beasts -- however conceptually transformed such fat may be.
