An enigmatic hymn, mystically representing inspired poetic thought and vision ary knowledge as a bird, clothed in light, seen inwardly by enlightened poets and1654 X.178
priests. The images, though not always clear, echo many found in similarly mystical  treatments of poetic inspiration, such as the famous Vena hymn (X.123), and make  a powerful impression.
## 1
The bird, anointed with the magic power of the lord, do those attentive  to poetic inspiration see with heart and mind.
The sage poets espy it within the sea; the ritual experts seek the footprint  of the light beams.
## 2
The bird carries speech by mind. The Gandharva spoke it within
the womb.
The sage poets protect the flashing, reverberating inspired thought in the  footprint of truth.
## 3
I saw the cowherd who never settles down, roaming back and forth along  the paths.
Clothing himself in those that (alternately) converge and diverge [=light  beams?], he keeps rolling along within the living worlds.
