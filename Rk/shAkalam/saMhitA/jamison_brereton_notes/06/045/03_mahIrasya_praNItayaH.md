I have silently suppressed the plurals in práṇītayaḥ and ūtáyaḥ (guidance and help, rather than guidances and helps). Given that práṇītayaḥ reprises ā́nayat … súnītī in the 1st vs. of the tṛca, it might be better to translate it as “Great is his leading.” The three -ti-stem abstracts práṇīti-, práśasti-, and ūtí- recall súnīti- in 1b.
