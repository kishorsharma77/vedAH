The first pāda of this vs. (pávasva vṛṣṭím ā́sú naḥ) seems syntactically backward, in that we might expect ā́sú naḥ to open the clause. A cursory glance through the sú passages in Lub does not turn up a similarly egregious deviation from left periphery behavior. The solution arises from reading the expression in light of 3c, asmábhyaṃ vṛṣṭím ā́ pava, which is an exact paraphrase with flipped word order. The full dative pronoun asmábhyam takes initial position there, while its enclitic equivalent naḥ is final in our pāda; the verbs occupy the opposite positions: initial in 1a, final in 3c. The obj. vṛṣṭím is identically positioned in the center of the two verses. In 3c the preverb ā̇́is more normally positioned than here, right before the verb (… ā́pava), but, on the other hand, the verb there is morphologically quite anomalous. Thus both pādas have something wrong with them, but their aberrancies can be understood with reference to each other.
