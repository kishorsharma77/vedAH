Indra  
Prabhūvasu Āṅgirasa  
8 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 8  
A simple hymn calling on Indra for help, the word that provides the outer skeleton  of the hymn: forms of the root “help” (√av) as noun or verb are found in the first  three verses and the last two (7–8). The interior verses (4–6) simply provide conven tional praise of Indra’s powers.
