In vs. 1 the Maruts were themselves called sáptayaḥ ‘spans’, but here that image is “repaired” by separating the Maruts from the spans of draught animals that bring them here.

The two raghu- cmpds. pick up raṃháyantaḥ in 5b.

The phrase urú vaḥ sádas kṛtám could technically be in apposition to barhíḥ and hence accusative -- “Sit on the barhis, the broad seat made for you” -- but none of the standard tr. so render it. The position of the vaḥ favors, but does not impose, this nominal sentence interpretation. For another reason supporting a separation into two clauses see comm. ad I.85.7.

The seat made for the Maruts on the ritual ground is here contrasted with the one they made for themselves in heaven in 2b (diví … ádhi cakrire sádaḥ), which event is then repeated in the next verse, 7b urú cakrire sádaḥ, though there the seat is in/on/above the “vault” (nā́kam).
