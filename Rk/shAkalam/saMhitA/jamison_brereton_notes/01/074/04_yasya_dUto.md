The second pāda contains two forms of √vī ‘pursue’, which by most tr. get reduced to one, with the finite veḥ seemingly playing merely a modal or auxiliary role: Ge “du … die Opferspenden entgegenzunehmen wünschest”; Re “tu vas pour agréer ses oblations”; Old (SBE) “to whose sacrificial food thou eagerly comest for feasting.” The doubling is, however, captured by WG: “der du (die Götter) aufspürst, damit sie die Opfergaben aufspüren,” resting on observations of Scar (498-99). I am in independent agreement with WG on this construction. The root √vī regularly takes both gods and oblation(s) as object; here the oblations are overt, but the gods are the missing first object - the initial goal of Agni’s pursuit, to cause them in turn to pursue the mortal worshiper’s oblations as underlying subject of the infinitive vītáye.

Cf. I.77.2 (also a Gotama hymn) agnír yád vér mártāya devā́n “When Agni, for the sake of the mortal, pursues the gods,” where the gods are surface object of véḥ and the benefit for the mortal worshiper is emphasized. In our own hymn vs. 6 has a full surface realization of the structure presumed here, with the gods as subj. of the infinitive and the oblations its object, though with a different main verb: ā́ca váhāsi tā́m̐ihá, devā́n … / havyā́… vītáye “You will convey the gods here to pursue the oblations.”
