Agni Raksohan ̣
Urukṣaya Āmahīyava
9 verses: gāyatrī
Although the Anukramaṇī assigns the hymn to Agni Rakṣohan “Demon-Smiter,”  this aspect of the god is very muted in the hymn—found only in verses 1, 7–8 and  rather tamely even there. The exuberantly and ingeniously violent punishments  envisaged in the other Rakṣohan hymn in X (X.87) are entirely absent. Instead the  dominant picture is of a peaceful sacrificial hearth in which the fire responds happily  to the attentions, and especially the butter oblations, of his worshipers. Stylistically  the hymn is characterized by chaining: the repetition of a word or phrase from one  verse in the next, with a different word or phrase from that verse repeated in the  following one.
