Ge takes vídānaḥ as belonging to √vid ‘know’ and construes it with the preceding PNs: “Das ist wahr, bei Turvaśa und Yadu bekannt.” It is true that the participle vídāna- ordinarily belongs to √vid ‘know’, but it is usually passive and appears with a predicate, “known as X.” The idiom envisioned here, “known to,” I’m not at all sure is a Sanskrit expression, though it works well in German and English. I therefore take the participle as belonging to √vid ‘find’, whose middle generally means ‘acquire’, with the soma “not to be spurned” (ahnavāyyám) as object. Turvaśa and Yadu offer soma to the gods elsewhere; cf. VIII.9.14 imé sómāso ádhi turváśe yádau. Ge takes ahnavāyyám with vy ā̀naṭ (“hat er nicht Abzustreitendes erreicht”), which prevents him from construing that verb with turváṇe as it is in the parallel he himself cites (VIII.12.19 ádhā yajñā́ya turváṇe vyā̀naśuḥ). His rendering of the last two words of the pāda as purpose infinitival clause (“dass der fromme Dienst triumphiere”) involves what seems to me a dubious construal of śámi.
