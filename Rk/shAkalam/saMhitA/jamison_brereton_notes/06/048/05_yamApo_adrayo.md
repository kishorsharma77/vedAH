On píprati as ‘carry to term’, a specialization of ‘carry to the far shore’, see comm. ad I.156.3, also in a birth context. Most take it as belonging to ‘fill’ (Gr, Re), while Ge tr. ‘nähren’ and considers it a blend of the two roots √pṝ (n. 5ab). Rather than assigning it to ‘fill’, I prefer to think that it participates in a word play with papraú ‘has filled’ in the next vs. (6a).
