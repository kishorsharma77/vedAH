On the disputed interpr. of vidhartári, see comm. ad VIII.70.2. As I disc. there, I interpr. the form not as an infinitive (with many), but as the loc. of the agent noun that it is morphologically. Here I envisage Soma in the role of a facilitator: he wants the vípra (presumably the human poet) to get a dakṣiṇā from the patron (/apportioner: vidhartár-), and sets about making that happen.

In c yádī is much better read yád ī, with the enclitic acc. prn. ī doubling the obj.

dhíyaḥ. It is difficult to construct an “if” reading.

The subj. of marmrjyáte is unspecified and unclear; it could either be Soma as kaví or the human vípra - or both.
