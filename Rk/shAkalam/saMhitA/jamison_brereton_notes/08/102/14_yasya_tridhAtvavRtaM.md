I don’t really understand this verse, but it seems to conjoin technical ritual references with an allusion to the myth of Agni’s flight and his concealment in the waters -- and these two interpretive strains are somewhat at cross purposes.

According to the śrauta sūtras, the darbha grass, that is, the barhis, is gathered into three or more bundles (cf., e.g., MŚS I.1.1.42, ĀpŚS I.4.10, BŚS I.2) in preparation for the sacrifice; hence pādas ab seem to depict a situation in which the preliminaries for the sacrifice have not been performed. This may well be because Agni has fled and so the regular ritual procedures have not been carried out. In c the waters in which Agni hides are said to have set down/deposited his footprint; in other words they have established him within themselves to hide him. Agni is regularly the obj. of ní √dhā; for his pádam being set down, see VIII.72.19, III.7.7, I.72.6, etc., and for ní √dhā in the context of Agni’s concealment X.32.6a nidhīyámānam ápagūḷham apsú.

But in ritual context the water’s setting down Agni’s footprint may refer to the sprinkling of the fire with water after it has been surrounded by barhis (see Ge’s n.

14c and Hillebrandt, Rit. Lit. 110), and therefore from a ritual point of view the preparations are proceeding smoothly. The next verse gives support to this alternative.
