In the publ. tr. this verse is couched in the English future because I took two of the three verbs in the verse (nákṣat and tastámbhat) as subjunctives and the third (tákṣat) as an injunctive but a rhyme form to nákṣat, each of them beginning a hemistich. I considered the verse a continuation of the prospective questions in vs. 1.

about Indra’s coming to the sacrifice. I have now accepted the view of Narten (Sig.Aor. 160; see also Hoffmann Injunk. 144) that nákṣat is instead an injunctive to the thematic stem of the enlarged root √nakṣ. This then seems to strand tastámbhat as a lone subjunctive in this sequence; Kü (575) labels it a subjunctive in preterital context. However, the passage may originally have had the indic. pf. *tastámbha, and tasthámbhat may have picked up a final dental from the initial of the following word: tastámbhad dyā́m# to match preceding nákṣat and tákṣat. Since dyā́m begins with a cluster, the meter is unaffected by a reading *tastámbha dyā́m. The cadence is terrible (four heavy syllables), but the only thing that would improve it is reading

*tastabha(d), with a zero-grade root syllable appropriate neither to the indicative nor
to the subjunctive.

Revising my understanding of the morphology requires revising the translation as well. I would now take the whole verse in the past: “The surpassing king came through the days to the age-old call of the clans of the Aṅgirases for the ruddy (cows). He fashioned the mace, his team-mate; he propped up heaven for the sake of the two-footed and four-footed belonging to men.” The verse then provides a reassuring model in the past for Indra’s hoped-for activity in the present. Note that nákṣat picks up the aor. ā́naṭ (approximately) from 1c and tastámbha(t) the aor.

Ge takes aruṇī́ḥ as nom. sg. fem., appositive to rā́ṭ, which must then be fem.

and mean ‘queen’ (“die Morgenröte, die Königin”). Both of these are grammatically possible: rā́ṭ must be fem. in V.46.8; aruṇī́ḥ must be nom. sg. in IV.1.16, 14.3. But this leaves the apparent masc. nom. sg. adj. turáḥ without a head. I therefore take aruṇī́ḥ as acc. pl., loosely construed with hávam. See Old. The ruddy ones are presumably the cows imprisoned in the Vala cave, who reappear (with a different color term, usríya-) in vs. 4.
