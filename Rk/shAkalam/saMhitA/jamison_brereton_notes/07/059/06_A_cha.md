The sequence sádatāvitā́is analyzed by the Pp. as sádata avitá, with the latter form generally taken as a 2nd pl. impv. to √av ‘help’. But this interpr. is problematic on grounds of both form and meaning. There is no stem avi- to √av; the best that can be done is to classify it with the -iṣ-aor. ávīt, etc., but, in addition to -irather than -iṣ-, the accent is wrong, since the -iṣ-aorist has root accent. Moreover, a form of ‘help’ fits badly in the passage, where the main verb should provide syntactic support for the infinitive phrase spārhā́ṇi dā́tave vásu “to give coveted goods.” These difficulties are treated in detail by Narten (Sig. aor. 87-88), who suggests an appealing and convincing solution, to read sádatā vitā́, with the latter the 2nd pl. impv.

to the root pres. of √vī ‘pursue’, a solution that does not require emending the Saṃhitā text. As Narten points out, this pres. appears elsewhere with an infinitive.

Although we ideally would expect a long root vowel (*vītā́), she adduces the 2nd sg.

impv. vihí (3x), beside more common vīhí, as a model. This solution is accepted by Lub, though it is rejected by Baum (Impv. in RV 93, although he hesitates p. 167); Klein (DGRV I.166, 167; II.39) implicitly accepts the Pp. reading, but he does not cite the following pāda containing the infinitive phrase.

The accent on the 2nd pl. impv. sádatā presumably results from its juxtaposition and contrast with adjacent vitā́.

ásredhantaḥ at the beg. of c can be either a voc. or a nom. pl.; nothing hangs on the exact identification.
