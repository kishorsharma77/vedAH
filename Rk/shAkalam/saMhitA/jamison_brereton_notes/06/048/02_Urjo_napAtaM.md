The first hemistich of this vs. is problematic. First, the acc. phrase ūrjó nápātam referring to Agni should be (and indeed must be) the obj. of dā́śema ‘we would ritually serve’, but this DIR.OBJ + VERB sequence is interrupted by a parenthetical nominal clause apparently referring to Agni in the nominative (sá … ayám). Further, the make-up of the complex hinā́yám is much discussed. As it happens, I devoted a brief article to just this expression (“RV sá hinā́yám (VI.48.2) with a Return Visit to nā́yám and nā́nā,” Fs. H. H. Hock, 2013). There I suggest that the proper segmentation is *hí nā́ayám, with the particle hí, which has lost its accent in the confusion, the nom. sg. nā́to nár- ‘man’, a form otherwise not found independently until the Amarakośa, extracted from the old āmreḍita nā́-nā ‘man after man’, used adverbially to mean ‘every man for himself, on his own’, plus the near deictic ayám. Alternative views are discussed in the art. cit.
