Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
6 verses: triṣṭubh
This short hymn begins with a verse full of phonetic and morphological play. The  middle two verses (3–4) contain seven repetitions of tvád “from you,” all but one  stationed at the beginning of the pāda. Verse 5 begins with tvā́m, “you” in a differ ent case, to bring that sequence to a close. Verse 5 also deploys playful oppositions
of gods and mortals, and the final verse is marked by alliterative sequences. The hymn identifies Agni as the source of both material goods (vss. 3–4) and  of poetic inspiration (vss. 2–3), and the highly wrought surface of this superficially  simple hymn shows that the poet has put the latter gift to good use.574 IV.12
