sahasrín- (sg. or pl.) regularly modifies rayí- and vā́ja-; bṛhánt- has a wider range of referents, but both rayí- and vā́ja- are found. Since (sg.) rayím occurs in the immediately preceding vs. (6b) and (sg.) vā́ja- in the immediately following pāda (7b), either is available to supply as the referent for the pl. adjectives in pāda a. I opt for vā́ja-, because of the nearer proximity.

If śrútyā in the Saṃhitā text represents dat. śrútyai (so Pp.) and belongs to a - ti-stem, it shows the younger ending (borrowed from the -ī-stems) -yai, confined to 7 stems mostly limited to Maṇḍala X (Macdonell VG p. 282), rather than the extraordinarily common -aye. This younger ending may correlate with the younger accent in this -ti-stem: as Lundquist has shown (“On the Accentuation of Vedic -tiAbstracts,” Indo-European Linguistics 3 [2015]), -ti-stems undergo accent retraction in the course of Vedic, and root-accented forms are innovations in the late RV. Vs. 4 contains another fem. short -i-stem with a younger ending borrowed from long -īstems, namely gen. pṛ́śnyāḥ. However, I wonder how secure śrútyai is. The use of this dative (quasi-)infinitive here is somewhat unusual, and I take its supposed double (also śrútyā in sandhi) in X.111.3 as an ablative. Old (Not.) points out that the gerundive śrútya- appears several times modifying vā́ja- (VII.5.9 vā́jaṃ śrútyam, I.36.12 vā́jasya śrútyasya). I am tempted to take our śrútyā here as somehow reflecting the gerundive, in a situation where the expected masc. acc. sg. *śrútyam would produce a bad cadence. But I cannot construct a plausible scenario; Old says that an acc. pl. is not entirely excluded, but that would have to be an acc. pl. neuter or fem., and vā́ja- is masc.

Kü (251) takes ví didyutaḥ as intrans., not trans.-caus. (in his terms, “inattingent” not “faktitiv”), interpreting uṣásaḥ as temporal. I am doubtful.

The simile in d svàr ṇá “like the sun” is perfectly ambiguous. It can be nominative, compared to Agni, the subject of ví didyutaḥ, as an entity that makes the dawns shine. (Given the temporal proximity of dawn and sunrise, this causal connection is perfectly in order.) Or Agni can make the dawns shine forth like the sun, with the simile in the acc. In 8b and 10d the same simile is in the nominative, but I do not think this is a sufficient reason to impose the same analysis here.
