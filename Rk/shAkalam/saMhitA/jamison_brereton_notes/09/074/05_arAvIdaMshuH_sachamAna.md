A variety of identifications have been suggested for the various elements in this vs. See the various tr.

In pāda a sácamāna ūrmíṇā “keeping company with the wave” echoes 1c divó rétasā sacate “keeps company with the semen of heaven,” though here the presence of the subj. aṃśúḥ ‘plant’ seems to anchor the expression to the ritual, without cosmic dimensions. In the ritual realm it probably refers to a slightly different part of the ritual from the one depicted in 1c, despite the presence of water in both cases.

There it most likely referred to the mixing of the soma juice with water, after the pressing. Here because of aṃśúḥ I think it refers to the initial soaking of the plant before pressing. This is supported by b, where it, namely the soaking water, swells the skin (pinvati tvácam) - the skin being, in my view, the outer surface of the plant.

The adj. devāvī́- modifying ‘skin’ usually modifies soma itself (see Scar 498), referring to the juice’s journey after pressing to the place where it will be offered to the gods. Here the various moments in the ritual are collapsed: it is not the skin, but the juice pressed from the skin, that seeks the gods.

However, in b the skin may also be the waterskin=cloud from which rain is produced (see, e.g., V.83.7) and in that case the plant of a could also be a cloud, roaring with thunder.

The 2nd hemistich is bookended by verb forms of √dhā: #dádhāti …dhā́mahe#. This etymological connection cannot easily be captured in English because each verb has an idiomatic sense: the first for the setting of an embryo, i.e., impregnation; the 2nd in the middle in the sense of ‘acquire’. Both ritual and cosmic readings are available here.

It is not clear to me whether Aditi here has any meaningful connection with the Aditi in 3b or is simply a reference to the ritual ground.
