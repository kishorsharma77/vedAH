With Ge, Re, KH (133), in the publ. tr. I supply a verb in ab. I now think this may be unnec. The impetus was the apparent change of person between the first hemistich and the second: with voc. soma in pāda a but a 3rd ps. verb (viśat) with Soma as subj. in c. However, as in vs. 12 the 3rd-ps. verb may result from attraction to the simile (jáno ná purí … viśat “as a man enters a fortress”), and the underlying person could be 2nd throughout; see dadhiṣe in d. It is hard to convey the change in Engl. but something like “O Soma, while you are being pressed by the stones here across the sheep's fleeces, as a man enters a fortress, as tawny one (you enter) into the two cups. You have established …” KH (133) argues that the changes of ps. mark pāda c as parenthetic, allowing it to be interpr. in his “general” sense. This sense should be possible even without branding the pāda as a parenthesis.
