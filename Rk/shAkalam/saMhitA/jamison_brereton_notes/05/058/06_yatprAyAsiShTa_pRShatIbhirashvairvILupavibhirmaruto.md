Although the adjacency of pṛ́ṣatībhir áśvaiḥ might seem to lend credence to the supposed shifting gender of áśva- ‘horse’ due to the clear fem. form of the preceding adj., it is better to follow the standard tr. in taking the two words as separate, with the fem. refering to dappled antelopes or simply dappled mares that serve as the horses for the Maruts’ chariot.

Pāda c is cleverly constructed: ā́paḥ ‘waters’ would be a perfectly acceptable subject of the following verb riṇaté ‘flow, dissolve’, but it is “bound” to kṣódante with the accent on riṇaté making the syntactic break clear. But the real subject of riṇaté, vánāni ‘trees’, is a much less appropriate subj. than what preceded.

VIII.7.26, adduced by Ge, makes it clear that Heaven is roaring with fear, but the roaring must also represent thunder.
