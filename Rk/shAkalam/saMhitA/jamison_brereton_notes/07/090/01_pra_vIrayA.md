As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn plays on the two senses of niyút- in Vāyu context: his teams of wind-horses and our teams of poetic thoughts. This ambiguity is fully on display in pāda c váha vāyo niyúto yāhy áchā, where acc. pl.

niyútaḥ is stationed between the two imperatives. váha and yāhy. The latter is interpr.

by the Pp. as accentless yāhi, but in this sandhi situation, followed by initially accented áchā, it could also represent yāhí. If this impv. is unaccented, niyútaḥ should be construed with it, with a clause boundary after preceding voc. vāyo. If it is accented, it should begin a new clause and niyútaḥ should be construed with váha.

The situation is complicated by the semi-parallel passage I.135.2 váha vāyo niyúto yāhy asmayúḥ, where unaccented yāhi is the only choice because the following word does not begin with an accented vowel. If niyútaḥ is to be contrued with yāhy, it is an acc. of goal and refers to our teams (poetic thoughts); if with váha, it should refer to Vāyu’s teams. Curiously, both Ge and Re in both passages choose to construe niyútaḥ with váha (e.g., “Fahre, Vāyu, die Niyut-Rosse, komm here!”), even though in I.135.2 this interpr. should be excluded. Old (ad I.135.2) opts for the other construction and tr. “fahre, Vāyu; zu (unsern) n.[iyút-] komm.” This interpr., the only one strictly possible in I.135.2, is further supported by III.35.1=VII.23.4 yāhí vāyúr ná niyúto no áchā “Travel like Vāyu to our teams” where niyútaḥ is clearly construed with yāhí. However, just because niyútaḥ needs to be construed with yāhy in our passage and in I.135.2, construing it also with váha isn’t excluded -- so an alt.

tr. of this passage and of I.135.2 could be “Drive (your teams), Vāyu; travel to our teams.” See also 3c.
