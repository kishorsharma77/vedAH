As Old points out, bṛhaté is a masc./neut. form apparently modifying two (or at least one) fem. nouns, svastáye sarvátātaye. Re takes it as a third term: “pour … le haut (rang),” but in his n. he acknowledges the Old/Ge acceptance of gender mismatch here, noting also that that interpr. produces two pairs of paired datives, the negated violence words in pāda a and the positive -ti-abstracts in b. In my view pattern may trump gender here. It’s also worth noting that the cadence produced by bṛhaté is bad, and it would be fixed by a fem. *bṛhatyai, so it is possible that bṛhaté was introduced redactionally - but why?
