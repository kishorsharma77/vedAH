práṣṭi- ‘side-horse’ is a rare word in the RV, occurring two other times in addition to a single instance of the deriv. práṣṭimant-. As often, the occurrence of a rare word can be attributed to phonological triggers; here prṣ̥́ atī ráthe / práṣṭir ...

róhitaḥ (with a nice scrambling of th à h...t in ráthe … róhitaḥ). Our pāda b is also found at I.39.6b, with rátheṣu pṛ́ṣatīr in the preceding pāda. (The other two occurrences are less phonologically driven.) The exact arrangement of the horses isn’t clear, and the sandhi form pṛ́ṣatī has accordingly received different grammatical analyses. I take it as representing underlying pṛ́ṣatīḥ, an acc. pl. fem., obj. of váhati (so also Gr, Bl). Ge (/Re) seems to take it rather as a nom. pl. implicitly conjoined with róhitaḥ, presumably with the verb agreeing with the latter. Hoffmann (Inj. 126) take the form as a dual nom., a parallel subj. to róhitaḥ.

Old suggests that riṇán(n) is a nom. sg. participle, modifying the subjects of yā́nti with incongruence of number. This seems unnecessary, since it can easily be a 3rd pl. injunctive, requiring no such grammatical adjustment.
