vaṅkú- is variously interpreted and etymologized; see EWA s.v. In this passage Ge takes it as ‘den fliegenden’ with ?, Re sim. (‘volant’ without ?); WG refuse to tr., but mention the common gloss ‘krumm’ in their n. Assuming (with most) that it belongs to √vañc ‘go crookedly, meander’, I take it here as ‘meandering’ à ‘wandering’, characterizing an itinerant poet. See ā́cara in the previous vs. (3c), which suggests such wandering. For a different specialization of the root meaning, see I.51.11.
