The phrase divyásya praśā́sane can be read in (at least) two different ways: either the Aśvins are “in command” of the divine (that is, they command the divine) or “at the command” of the divine (that is, the divine gives them the command). I follow Ge in taking it as the latter; he cleverly suggests that this shows the Aśvins in their proper position between gods and men -- in other words, they are middle management.
