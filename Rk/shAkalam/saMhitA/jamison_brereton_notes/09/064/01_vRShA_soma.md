Old’s interpr. of vṛ́ṣā in c as a neut. pl. adj. with dhármāṇi seems both unnecessary and unlikely. I know of no other neut. forms of vṛ́ṣan- (the few cited by Old are not convincing), which suggests to me that, despite its widely accepted classification as an adj., the stem is synchronically a masc. noun, which, however, can be used as an adjunct strengthener of another noun, hence “bull X” as the equivalent of “bullish X” - a usage similar to English ‘horse’ as an augmentative, meaning ‘strong, large, coarse’ (as in, for ex., horseradish). See https://www.etymonline.com/word/horseradish Moreover, since nom. sg.

vṛ́ṣā opens the two previous pādas of this vs., it seems unlikely that a morphologically different, and at the least very rare, phonologically identical form would open the third - esp. since, when a neut. adj. is required in the next vs. (2a), the deriv. vṛ́ṣṇya- is employed.
