The syntactic affiliation of the final pāda of this vs., consisting of a dat. dyumnā́ya and an acc. phrase sutárā apáḥ, is unclear. Old suggests taking the acc. as a second obj. of āvívāsati, or rather suggests supplying the same verb as main clause verb “(he also wins) waters …” But since the structure of ab, in which the mortal seeks Indra’s favor, invites a demonstration of that favor in the main cl., I therefore borrow kṛṇoti (deaccented) from 10c, with Indra as subj. This is also Re’s solution and apparently Ge’s. For √kṛ in similar expressions, see VII.97.8 kárad bráhmaṇe sutárā sugādhā́ “He [=Bṛhaspati/Indra] will make good fords, easy to cross, for the sacred formulation” and IV.19.6 sutaraṇā́m akṛṇor indra síndhūn “You made the rivers easy to cross, Indra.”
