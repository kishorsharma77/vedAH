It is striking -- and perhaps a little insulting -- to refer to the gods Indra and Viṣṇu as soma-holding tubs, though of course once they have drunk the soma, that is what, in effect, they are. This image recurs in 6d.

The two heavy pres. passive participles śasyámānāḥ and gīyámānāsaḥ seem meant to convey that the sacrifice is currently ongoing, hence my “as they are being …” In d arkaíḥ is taken by Ge and Re as referring to the chants of the sacrifice, and in the context of recitation and singing this sense is clearly the principal one. Both Ge and Re interpr. the instr. as meaning “in the form of,” and I have followed them in the publ. tr. -- though an instr. of accompaniment “along with chants” would also be possible. I further think the word is a pun, with the secondary sense “along with the rays (of the sun)” as often (e.g., VI.4.6). This would be a temporal designation of dawn, when the sacrifice is taking place. That the next vs. contains a similar pun (in my view) supports such an interpr. here.
