Pāda b is most likely an embedded relative -- a very rare syntactic phenomenon in the RV -- because the most likely reading of c is that the singers sing (a) “at the pressings” (sutéṣu c), not that Indra performed his deeds sutéṣu. However, it is just possible that sutéṣu could mean “in (the exhilaration of) the pressed soma drinks” and therefore continue the rel. cl. in b. In any case in this casually assembled Gāyatrī hymn, a syntactic violation does not seem too critical.
