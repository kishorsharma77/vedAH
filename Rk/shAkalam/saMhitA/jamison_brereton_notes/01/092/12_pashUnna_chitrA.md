This last verse of the trimeter portion of the hymn plays more tricks with simile structure. In pāda a prathānā́functions like niṣkṛṇvānā́in 1c; that is, it has both reflexive and transitive values. In the frame it is reflexive (“spreading herself”), in my view, though Ge, Re, Macd., Maurer all supply “rays” as the object, on no contextual grounds. (However, Ge does allow for the reflexive possibility in his notes 12a, 1c.) In the simile paśū́n is the object; the assumed subject might be “cowherd” or the like (so tentatively Re). But the simile is quite appropriate to Dawn for two reasons: first, it is often said that livestock go out to pasture at dawn and return to the fold at night; second, the rays of Dawn are often referred to as cows (see in fact vs. 2 above), and though I don’t think the stem paśú- is so used, it inhabits the same semantic space as the more usual terms that participate in this metaphor.

The second simile, síndhur ná kṣódaḥ in b, is taken by Ge, Re, Macd., Maurer with the verb of b, vy àśvait. Because this verb ‘whitened’ is intransitive, this requires either taking kṣódaḥ adverbially (Re “comme le fleuve (en son) remous”) or construing síndhuḥ … kṣódaḥ as a loose compound (Ge “wie die Stromflot”).

Although either is possible, the syntactic difficulties disappear if the simile falls within the verbal domain of prathānā́, “like a river spreading its surge.” Given this poet’s particular delight in manipulating similes, it is entirely in character to end this section of the hymn with a triple play.

WG interpret the similes more or less as I do.

Pāda c is structurally parallel with 11c, using the same verb mī ‘diminish, belittle’, though here in the negative (11c praminatī́, 12c áminatī), both playing off āminānā́in 10c. The relationship between 11c and 12c is particularly close, with the human and the divine playing off each other: 11c praminatī́manuṣyā́yugā́ni, 12c áminatī daívyāni vratā́ni.
