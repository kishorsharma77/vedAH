For obvious real-world reasons Agni [=fire] would not sit on the ritual grass, because it would go up in flames (cf. comm. ad IV.6.4). But Agni regularly brings the other gods to sit on this grass, and so the mention of his coming here and of the “god-seeking” (devayú-) people may have made the action seem appropriate.
