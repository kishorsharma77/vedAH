The íd in pāda a seems displaced: we would expect yám íd …, though that order would produce a choppy meter. The íd in c is better positioned, though we actually might expect it to be limiting asya, not the tám anticipating śúṣmam. The publ. tr. does not render either íd; if I were to do so, the result would be “(It’s) just (him) whom the songs make strong … just his tempestuous force that the worldhalves respect.”
