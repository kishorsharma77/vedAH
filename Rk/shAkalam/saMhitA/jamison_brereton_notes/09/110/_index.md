On the rare meters and their deployment in the hymn see publ. intro. Likewise for its thematic structure and its connections to the previous hymn, IX.109. It is probably not an accident that the six middle verses, in a meter otherwise not found in the RV (see Old, Proleg. 130), are the conceptually challenging ones, flanked by three vss. at the beginning and three at the end that are fairly straightforward. An omphalos structure signalled by meter.
