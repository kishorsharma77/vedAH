Aśvins
Sadhvaṃsa Kāṇva
23 verses: anuṣṭubh
Despite the Anukramaṇī ascription, the poet of this hymn repeatedly identifies him self as Vatsa (vss. 7, 8, 11, 15, 19), the Kaṇva. His composition is monotonously  one-note: “Come/drive here to us” is found, with few variations, in the first seven  verses and in a number of later ones (10, 11, 14, 17, 19); the Aśvins are urged to leave  wherever in the cosmos they find themselves (e.g., vss. 3–4, 7, 14), in order to come  to our sacrifice, and the usual anxieties about competing sacrificers who might tempt  the gods to pass us by are on view (vs. 8). The poet’s uncertainty about the location  of the Aśvins and his desire to lure the gods to his sacrifice and away from his com petitors are summed up in the final verse (23), with its paradoxical presentation of  the “three footsteps” of the Aśvins, which are both visible and hidden. The evocation
of Viṣṇu’s three strides is probably deliberate, but the reasons for it unclear. There is little other content in the hymn beyond the urged journey, the offered  sacrifice, and the expressed hopes for bounties in exchange. Verse 10 briefly and  obliquely alludes to the maiden Sūryā’s mounting of the Aśvins’ chariot, from the  well-known myth about Sūryā’s marriage, and the names of some successful clients  of the Aśvins are listed in verses 20–21.
