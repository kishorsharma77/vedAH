In this vs. Indra identifies himself with the three most resonant RVic words for poet: ṛ́ṣi-, vípra-, kaví-. I am not sure why. The named beings in the 2nd hemistich, Kutsa and Uśanā, belong in the same mythic complex, along with Indra; see in this Indra cycle IV.16.10-12. Kakṣīvant is one of the most accomplished RVic poets (I.116-26), and his collection immediately follows that attributed to Kutsa (I.101-15).

But again I don't know why he claims identity with Kakṣīvant, esp. because only one hymn of Kakṣīvant’s is even possibly dedicated to Indra (the maddening I.121).

However, note the borrowing of phraseology from Kakṣīvant in IV.27.4 (see comm. ad loc.). His desire to claim both Manu (first man) and the sun (most prominent heavenly body) is more understandable.

In c I take ny ṛ̀ñje not as a 1st sg. present but as the homophonous 1st sg.

injunctive to the 6th cl. pres. ṛñjá- and therefore as preterital.
