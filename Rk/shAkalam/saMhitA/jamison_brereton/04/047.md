Vāyu (1), Vāyu and Indra (2–4)
Vāmadeva Gautama
4 verses: anuṣṭubh
Like the immediately preceding hymn, this one fulfills its ritual purpose with a mini mum of fuss: Vāyu, and then Indra and Vāyu, are invited to partake of the first  soma offerings at the Morning Pressing.
## 1
Vāyu, the clear (soma) has been held out to you, the foremost of the  honey, at the rituals of daybreak.
(Since you are) craved, drive here to drink the soma, o god, (on a
chariot) with a team.
## 2
O Indra and Vāyu, you two have the right to the drinking of these soma  drinks,
for the drops go to you like waters, converging, to the deep.
## 3
O Vāyu and Indra, tempestuous ones, lords of power, on the same  chariot,
provided with teams, drive here to help us, to drink the soma.
## 4
Your teams, craved by many, which are for the pious, o men,
stop them by us, o Indra and Vāyu, you whose vehicle is the sacrifice.
