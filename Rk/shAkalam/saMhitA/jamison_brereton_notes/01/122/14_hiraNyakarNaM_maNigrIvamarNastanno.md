As is recognized by all, the flood (árṇaḥ) is the herd of gift cows, whose constant turbulent motion must have suggested the metaphor. Accentless maṇigrīvam Old considers a “monstrosity” due to faulty transmission. It must be a bahuvrīhi like immediately preceding híraṇyakarṇam, and I now wonder if the phrase híraṇyakarṇam maṇigrīvam actually represents a dvandva consisting of two bahuvrīhis (‘possessing golden ears and ornamented necks’), which could account for the single accent. The geminate m across the compound boundary (-karṇam maṇi-) might have been redactionally introduced from *-karṇa-maṇi-). The first members of the two compounds híraṇya- and maṇi- are the constituents of the phrase híraṇyena maṇínā in I.33.8, on which see my extensive discussion in “A Golden Amulet in Vedic and Avestan” (Ged. H. P. Schmidt).

Pāda b is repeated verbatim from 3d, but because it has an object (the flood) it has a slightly different sense from there.

The reason for the doubled ā́in c is not clear to me.

cākantu is taken, plausibly, as haplologized from *cākanantu. See, most recently, Kü (131).
