Ge, flg. Sāy, supplies rayím in ab, quite persuasively because the same phrase apatyasā́cam śrútyam explicitly modifying rayím is found in I.117.23, II.30.11. Re suggests rather śúṣmam on the basis of c, but this does not enter into the same formulaic nexus and seems a less likely gift in any case.
