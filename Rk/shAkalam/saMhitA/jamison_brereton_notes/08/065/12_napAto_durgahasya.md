Ge and Old make heavier weather of ab than seems necessary, motivated in part by tvé rather than tvā in a and the positioning of the verb in b rather than a, near to ūtáyaḥ. Ge supplies a form of √dhā in a, “Zwar werden viele Hoffnungen auf dich (gesetzt),” and takes hávante as passive, “und werden deine Hilfen … angerufen.” But the stem háva- is overwhelmingly transitive. Old suggests taking ūtáyaḥ as accusative pl., which would do even more violence to the grammar. I take the subject of hávante to be āśásaḥ ‘hopes’. As for tvé: although √hū ordinarily takes the accusative, I can imagine a locatival tvé in a more distanced usage: they call towards you, but they do not actually succeed. (Alternatively the tvé could have been influenced by tvé in 13a, in the same metrical position, though metrically distracted.) I then take ūtáyaḥ as a separate existential clause.
