As just noted, this vs. leaves the rough-and-tumble and provides a solemn and conventional end to the hymn. For a similar sequence of X-sā́- cmpds in a hymnfinal vs., see, e.g., IX.2.10, whose pāda b is identical to pāda b here, save for the case (nom. vs. acc.). It also, as noted before, ring-compositionally echoes vs. 1 dhiyé with dhíyam. The dhī́- that we launched in vs. 1 will now (we pray) be crowned with goods.

The first hemistich nicely begins and ends with utá, though the two have different functions—the first as interstanzaic conjunction (Klein DGRV I.401) and the other conjoining the acc. obj. nouns in series (ibid. 351-52).
