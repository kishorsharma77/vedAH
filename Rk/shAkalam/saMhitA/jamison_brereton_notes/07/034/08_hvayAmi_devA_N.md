Old asserts that áyātu- is a determin. cmpd., not a bahuvrīhi, thus ‘nonsorcerer’ rather than ‘not having sorcery/sorcerer’. The publ. tr. reflects -- and indeed reflects somewhat loosely -- a bahuvrīhi interpr., though I think the difference is minor. Re also takes it as a b.v.: “sans (user de) sorcellerie” (tr. EVP V), “sans user de procédés magiques” (comm., EVP IV); see also Wh n. ad AV tr. VIII.4.16.

Nonetheless, a determin. interpr. is a reasonable alternative: “I -- no sorcerer -- invoke the gods.” A 2nd RVic occurrence of this stem, acc. áyātum in VII.104.16, with AVŚ+P repetitions, is not registered in Gr., which omission is probably responsible for Re’s erroneously calling our occurrence a hapax in his comm. Unfortunately this other occurrence does not resolve the question of cmpd type. The cmpd. is not disc. in AiG.

Presumably the implied opposition in this vs. is between sorcery in the 1st half-vs. and truth (ṛtá-) of the 2nd half. So also Re (comm.).
