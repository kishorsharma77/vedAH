After the extravagances of the last few vss., this vs. brings us back to earth and opens the last section of the hymn, addressing Agni and praising his benefits.

The morphological and phraseological parallelism of vibhúḥ (c) and paribhū́ḥ (d) are difficult to convey in tr. On the basis of the viśváthā ‘everywhere’ with the former and the passages containing víśvā (…) paribhū́- (I.91.19, II.24.11, III.3.10), I have supplied ‘everything’ with the latter (so also Ge, WG; sim. Old [SBE]).

As in I.37.9 I construe ánu with preceding sīm “following them.”
