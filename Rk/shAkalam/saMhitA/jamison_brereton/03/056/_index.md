All Gods  
Prajāpati Vaiśvāmitra or Prajāpati Vācya  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
Another enigmatic and mystical All God hymn, with its mysteries, as so often,  couched in numerological terms, primarily as threes or multiples of three. In the  earlier parts of the hymn these numbers seem to refer to cosmic entities—perhaps,  for example, the three heavens and three earths making up the six in verse 2—and  to cosmic creation, though the details are far from clear. But the number three takes  a strongly ritual turn beginning with verse 5, referring to three daily rites, that is, to  the three pressings of the soma sacrifice. Thus the poet implicitly identifies ritual  structure with cosmic structure.
