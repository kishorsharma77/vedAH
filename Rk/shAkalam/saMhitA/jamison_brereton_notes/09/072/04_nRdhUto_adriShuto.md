Although both Ge and Re tr. -dhūta- as ‘shaken’, I prefer the more technical soma-ritual sense ‘rinse’. On √dhāv (∾ √dhavi ∾ √dhū) ‘rinse’ as a semantic specialization of the same root meaning ‘shake’, see EWA s.v. DHAVI , Gotō [1st Cl.

186-89]). This root complex is distinct from √dhāv ‘run’. See further ad vs. 8 below.

Both Ge and Re take pradívaḥ with what precedes; this is entirely possible and impossible to determine. Not much rests on it.
