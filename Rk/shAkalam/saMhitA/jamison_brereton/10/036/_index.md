All Gods  
Luśa Dhānāka  
14 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 13–14  
This hymn is a clear companion piece to the preceding one, X.35. Both hymns con sist of fourteen verses, all jagatī except the last two in triṣṭubh. Both have a refrain,  and the refrain of X.36 (vss. 2–12) is a minor variant of the last pāda of the first verse  of X.35. And there is some shared vocabulary. However, X.36 is not tied closely to  the morning sacrifice, as X.35 is. The range of gods invoked in X.36 is wider than  those in X.35, although there is a distinct Ādityan cast here as well (see vss. 1, 3–4,  12–13). The hymn seems somewhat loosely and inattentively constructed.
