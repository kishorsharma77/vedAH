Ge takes gómataḥ with te, not sumnásya as I do. This is possible but not necessary, especially since the adjective isn’t exclusively, or even generally, used of beings, and since neuter gómat is found in the following verse (probably modifying an unexpressed word for spoils or the like, though I suppose neut. sumnám might be possible).
