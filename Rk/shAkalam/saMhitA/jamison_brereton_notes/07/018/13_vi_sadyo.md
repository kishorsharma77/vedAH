With nom. índraḥ this vs. seems to return to 3rd ps. reference—though it’s worth noting that both verbs of which índraḥ is subject are ambig. between 2nd and 3rd ps. (dardaḥ b, bhāk c), and so an appositive 2nd ps. reading “(you,) Indra, …” is barely possible.

The adv. sadyáḥ ‘in an instant, all at once’ seems to clash semantically with its verb dardaḥ, given the usual function of the “intensive” as a frequentative. It would probably be better here to render sadyáḥ with Ge as ‘in a single day’, indicating that Indra could destroy multiple fortifications in a limited time span.

The 1st pl. jeṣma is generally interpr. these days as a precative: see esp.

Hoffmann (Injunk. 254), Narten (Sig.Aor. 119-20), and Ge’s tr. “Möchten wir … besiegen.” Certainly the other two occurrences of this form in the RV (VI.45.12, X.156.1) have clear modal value. But in this context, in a long narrative set in the past, though carried in part by injunctive forms like dardaḥ and bhāg in this vs., a modal would be jarring and would interrupt the narrative by suddenly expressing a hope for the future. I therefore follow, for this form here, the older interpr. of jeṣma (see reff, in Hoffmann and Narten) as an irregular injunc. (for expected *jaiṣma; cf. ajaiṣma VIII.47.18=X.164.5).
