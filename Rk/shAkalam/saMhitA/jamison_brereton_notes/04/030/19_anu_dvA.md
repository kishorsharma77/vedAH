The blind man and the lame one also figure in IV.19.9, along with the son of the unmarried woman; see vs. 16 above. The blind and the lame form a pair elsewhere in the RV, e.g., I.112.8; II.13.12, 15.7; VIII.79.3.

The infinitival phrase ná … áṣṭave is rendered in the publ. tr. “not to be equalled,” though it lit. means “not to be reached/attained.” The lit. tr. implies that no one can actually receive Indra’s favor, but I think the point is rather that favor such as Indra’s cannot be deployed by anyone else (that is, any other deity) -- hence the adjustment in the English. On this interpr, see Hoffmann (185). Ge supplies “with words” (i.e., “not to be obtained [with words]”), presumably meaning that no poet can describe the extent of Indra’s favor.
