Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
4 verses: uṣṇih
A simple hymn, in which the refrain (pāda c of each verse) offers Indra soma to  drink, and the first half of each verse consists of a definitional relative clause refer ring to Indra’s deeds in his soma-exhilaration. As often, the pattern set in the rest  of the hymn is modified but not entirely broken in the final verse: verses 1–3 contain  the syntagm yásya...máda- “(in) whose exhilaration,” while the final verse substi tutes the participle mandāná “finding exhilaration” for the etymologically related  noun máda, and also inserts a part of the soma plant, its stalk, on which the relative  pronoun is dependent.
## 1
In whose exhilaration you subdued Śambara for Divodāsa—
here is that soma, Indra, pressed for you. Drink!
## 2
Whose sharp-pressed exhilaration, whose middle and end, you guard— here is that soma, Indra, pressed for you. Drink!
## 3
In whose exhilaration you set loose from the rock the cows fixed firm  within—
here is that soma, Indra, pressed for you. Drink!
## 4
Finding exhilaration in whose stalk, you acquire the capacity for  generosity—
here is that soma, Indra, pressed for you. Drink!
