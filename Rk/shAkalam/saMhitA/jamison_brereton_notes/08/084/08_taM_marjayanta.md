The small interpretive issue in this verse is who is the referent of svéṣu.

Ge/Re take it as Agni, while I think it’s the unidentified pl. subjects of marjayanta, presumably the priests (so also Scar 417). An argument for my position might be the fact that we might expect the reflexive adjective to be controlled by the syntactic subject, but it is my sense that this is not a hard and fast rulem in Rigvedic syntax.

More to the point, in my opinion, is that 6ab … káro, víśvā asmábhyaṃ sukṣitī́ḥ “… you will make all dwellings lovely for us” and 9a kṣéti kṣémebhiḥ “he [=the favored mortal] dwells peacefully in peaceful ways …” associate dwellings with the mortal worshipers.
