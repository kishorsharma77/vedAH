The question in this vs. is what to do with gūrtā́(ḥ). The standard tr. take it as modifying the temporal expression pūrvī́r uṣásaḥ śarádaś ca -- hence, e.g., Ge’s “[v]iele gelobte Morgen und Herbste.” This is grammatically fine and perhaps also supported by the fact that the adj. is in the same pāda as the temporal expression.

Still, I am somewhat unsatisfied by this interpr. On the one hand, as Klein points out (DGRV I.74), this small group of Vāmadeva Indra hymns contains three similar temporal expressions (IV.16.19, 18.4, and here), and the only adjectives are quantitative ones, so ‘welcomed, besung, praised’ would be an intrusion in the formulaic language. Moreover, svágūrta- ‘self-greeted, i.e., gurgling’ is used twice of rivers (I.140.13 síndhavaḥ, X.95.7 nadyàḥ), and something like that would fit semantically here. The problem of course is that síndhu- is masc., and so gūrtā́ḥ cannot modify acc. pl. síndhūn as the publ. tr. implies. It is possible that the expression síndhavaś ca svágūrtāḥ in I.140.13 was transposed to our passage without adjusting the gender. More likely is that the acc. pl. of another, feminne word for rivers, streams, or waters should be supplied: nadyàḥ- as in X.95.7, sīrā́ḥ as in pāda c of this vs., or apáḥ, the default watery referent in the Vṛtra myth. The tr. should be emended to better reflect this: “… he set loose the welcomed [/gurgling]

*(waters/streams and) the rivers.” Strikingly svágūrta-, which occurs only 4x total in the RV, appears two vss. later (10c) in the same metrical position with the same
sandhi form. It there modifies ápāṃsi ‘labors’. Is it too fanciful to suggest that that phrase, svágūrtā, ápāṃsi, is meant to invoke *(svá)gūrtā, *apáḥ here? For further disc. see also Old ad loc.
