Daksiṇ ̣ā (Priestly Gift) or Its Givers
Divya Āṅgirasa or Dakṣiṇā Prājāpatyā
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 4
These extravagant praises of the dakṣiṇā (“priestly gift”), which is given by the  sacrificer to the various priests who officiate at his sacrifice, are clearly in the poet’s  interests, as he stands to receive a portion of the sacrificer’s largesse. The hymn sel dom strays from its point—that a dakṣiṇā, once given, brings untold benefits to the  giver, both material and spiritual, far exceeding the value of the original gift. It is a  persuasive, if somewhat monotone, piece of work.
