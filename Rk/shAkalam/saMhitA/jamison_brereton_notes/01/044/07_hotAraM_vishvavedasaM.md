The very common epithet viśvávedas-, used especially of Agni, has a potential double sense in all its occurrences: ‘possesing all possessions’ and ‘possessing all knowledge’. In fact, although the latter is generally favored in standard RV translations, the former may be the more stable sense, in that its 2nd member védas- is widespread in the meaning ‘possession, property’, but not found as a simplex in the meaning ‘knowledge’. The parallel formation jātávedas- (see above, vs. 4) has a similar problem. Though generally rendered as ‘who has knowledge of the beings’ it could as well mean ‘who has possession of the beings’. Since jātávedas- seems to have become more opaque to its users than viśvávedas-, which does often (?) participate in its context, in the publ. tr. we do not translate jātávedas-.
