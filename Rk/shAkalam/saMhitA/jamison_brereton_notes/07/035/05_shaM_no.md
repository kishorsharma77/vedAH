Ge takes b as another break in the pattern: “Das Luftreich soll uns Glück sehen lassen,” with śám the object of the inf. dṛśáye. But this seems unlikely: the clause is easy to interpret within the template, and furthermore the periphrastic causative assumed by his tr. would be awkwardly or impossibly expressed (lit. “let the Midspace be for us to see luck”); to express such a meaning we would expect rather a form of √kṛ (“let the Midspace make us to see luck”).
