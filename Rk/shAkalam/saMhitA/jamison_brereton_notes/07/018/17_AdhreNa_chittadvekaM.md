If my interpr. of 14c is correct in taking the small number (66) as the allies of Indra facing off a much larger force, this vs. continues the same theme, first as a straightforward statement (a), then with two different metaphors (b, c): Indra easily prevailed despite the relative insufficiency of his tools.

In b, if the standard interpr. of pétva- as ‘castrated ram, wether’ is correct (see, e.g., EWA s.v.), the pairing of target and instrument is esp. striking: a fierce but female wild animal, the lioness, and a castrated but (originally) male domestic one, a wether, with opposition of both animal-type (wild/domestic) and gender, with the latter complicated by the emasculation of the male representative.

The same thematic and syntactic template prevails in c, but neither the target nor the tool is clearly identified. veśī́- (in the instr. veśyā̀) is a hapax; the standard tr. 11 ‘needle’ derives from Sāy., but in fact this doesn’t make much sense. sraktí- has better representation: it’s found in the cmpd. náva-srakti- ‘9-srakti-ed’ (also VS cátuaḥ-srakti) and has an Aves. cognate sraxti-, �raxti- ‘edge, side’. EWA connects it with sṛká- ‘fang’. To figure out what must be going on, we need to turn to the verb, áva … (a)vṛścat. The lexeme áva √vraśc ‘hew down’ is found only once elsewhere, in I.51.7, where it is used figuratively. But ní √vraśc, with the semantically similar preverb ní, twice appears with a concrete image: hewing down trees with an axe. See esp. I.130.4fg táṣṭeva vrk̥ ṣám vaníno ní vrś̥ casi, paraśvéva ní vrś̥ casi “like a carpenter a tree from the wooden one [=forest], you cut down (the serpent) -- as if with an ax you cut (him) down” (sim. VI.8.5). The acc. pl. sraktī́ḥ in our passage matches the role of the trees in the passages just cited. I suggest that as ‘edge’ it refers to the edges of a tree trunk or to something that is, as it were, pure ‘edge’ -- a pole. As the instr., veśyā̀should correspond to the axe. A needle doesn’t work, but perhaps a pin -

- a small, sharp-pointed object that would ordinarily not have much success in felling
tall poles. I agree with Old that the expression is probably proverbial.

The ending of d, bhójanā sudā́se, is identical to the end of the last vs., 15d, preceded by víśvāni (15d) and víśvā (16d) respectively. The bhójanā that the enemies abandoned in 15 are here given to Sudās by Indra.
