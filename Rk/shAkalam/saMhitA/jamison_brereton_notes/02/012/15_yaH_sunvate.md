As often, a pattern well established through most of a hymn gets broken, or shaken up, at the end. Here the 3rd sg. reference to Indra in the first 14 vss. changes to 2nd sg. address, but this change isn’t immediately signaled: the vs. begins with a rel.

pronoun yáḥ that apparently matches the monotonously regular occurrence of the rel.

with 3rd ps. ref. in the rest of the hymn. Only the verb dárdarṣi in b, the last word in its clause, shows that the pattern has been broken.

The sandhi form dudhrá is ambiguous: it can reflect either a nom. sg. dudhráḥ with the Pp. or a loc. sg. dudhré. The publ. tr. (JPB’s) opts for the latter, a possibility floated by both Ge (n. 15a) and Old, who does not decide. The loc. interpr. has the advantage of allowing the oddly placed ā́cid, which would represent ā́as “Praep. mit vorhergehendem Loc.” (Gr. 169) plus ‘even’ emphasizing that loc. Ge’s tr. follows the nom. of the Pp, and there are arguments in favor of this interpr. -- dudhráelsewhere modifies Indra (I.56.3, VI.22.4 [2 out of 5 total occurrences]), and introducing a new personage in this vs. seems unnecessary. Like Old I can’t decide.

The main clause sá kílāsi satyáḥ “you are certainly real” is an implicit answer to the doubt expressed in 5b utém āhur naíṣó astī́ti enam “And they say about him, ‘he does not exist.’” The 2nd ps. reference of sá in the just quoted expression is contrary to my rules of such reference with this pronoun -- that 2nd ps. sá (etc.) is only found with imperatives and verbs so used. But the whole structure of this hymn, with the refrain sá janāsa índraḥ in the same metrical slot as this declaration, imposes the need for a sá here as well.

The final pāda, suvī́rāso vidátham ā́vadema, is a variant of the standard Gṛtsamāda Triṣṭubh refrain bṛhad vadema vidáthe suvī́rāḥ. The refrain pāda here is found twice elsewhere (I.117.25, VIII.48.14), neither of them in Maṇḍala II or in a Gṛtsamāda hymn. The reason for this variation isn’t clear, since the standard refrain would fit here unproblematically. Perhaps to mark the specialness of this particular hymn?
