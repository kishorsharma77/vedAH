All Gods
Pratibha Ātreya
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5
This hymn picks up where the previous hymn ended, with the gods Savitar  (“Impeller”) and Bhaga (“Fortune”) and their bounty to mortals. These two gods  are the topic of verses 1 and 2 here, and the first four (of five) verses concern the dis tribution of treasures to men, with a widening circle of gods responsible for these  gifts. The context (as vs. 3 makes especially clear) is the distribution of dakṣiṇās  (priestly gifts) at the early-morning ritual. Verse 5 asks for more general blessings  than just wealth, but in its references to the “formless void” and to “wide space,”  it also seems to depict dawn, which creates visible and articulated space from  formlessness.
