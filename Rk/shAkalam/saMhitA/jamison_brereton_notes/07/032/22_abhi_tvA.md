Despite Ge’s easy “dessen Auge die Sonne ist,” I cannot accept this for svardṛ́śam. First, dṛ́ś- is never an ‘eye’, but rather ‘seeing’ or ‘having the appearance of’, and furthermore, it’s Varuṇa who has the sun as his eye (that is, his spy). Here I think the point is rather that Indra, like the sun, sees everything in the world, here expressed by the merism “the moving and the still.”
