something else is enclosing Agni, configured as a calf (vátsaṃ), using pári √as.

(I wonder if the somewhat pleonastic presence of bhúvat in our passage is meant to resonate with those pári √bhū passages.) Thus, though in our passage Agni is clearly the object of enclosure in the myth of his hiding in the waters, he himself can take the role of encloser in this tight-knit collection - allowing for the possibility that he might here be supplied as subjective genitive with páriṣṭiḥ, save for the mythological context.

All in all, I.65.3cd packs a lot into its ten syllables and five words, as witnessed by the many more words (more than ten times as many) in this entry required to describe its syntactic and semantic tricks.
