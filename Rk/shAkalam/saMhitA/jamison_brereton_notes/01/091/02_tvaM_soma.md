This verse is structured by a series of etymological figures involving a nom. sg. modifying soma and an instr. pl. specifying his qualities -- a: krátubhiḥ sukrátuḥ, b: dákṣaiḥ sudákṣaḥ, c: vṛ́ṣā vṛṣatvébhiḥ, d: dyumnébhir dyumnī́. It is a not a subtle device, but effective. On the first hemistich see further ad vs. 14.
