There is much disagreement on what to supply with híraṇyasaṃdṛśaḥ and indeed on whether it modifies rā́jñaḥ, interpreted as an acc. pl. (see Ge n. 38ab).

Since it seems unlikely that Kaśu gave the poet ten golden kings, even as figurines (pace Old), it seems best to take rā́jñaḥ as gen. sg. and supply another desirable golden item. Ge suggests garments, probably in part because of the hide-tanners? Hoffmann (Inj. 229 n. 227) points out that gold(-bedecked) horses are mentioned elsewhere in dānastutis, and I follow him in the publ. tr. However, given how prominently gold figures in the description of chariots in this hymn (vss. 28-29, 35; cf. also 11), ‘chariots’ might be a better choice.

The apparently contemptuous ‘hide-tanning’ (carmamnā́ḥ) must be a way of indicating that, in comparison with Kaśu, all men hereabouts are no better than tanners: ignoble, low, and engaged in dirty and polluting activity. But perhaps there’s just a whiff of a suggestion that Kaśu has enough cows to furnish work for many tanners -- and therefore he should be more generous with these cows to his poet.
