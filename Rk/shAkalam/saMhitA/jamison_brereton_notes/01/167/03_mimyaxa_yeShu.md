For the punning and diametrically opposed, negative and positive readings of this vs. mediated by sabhā́vatī, see the publ. intro. Rodasī is depiced both as fit for the sabhā (gaming hall) like a young woman who goes there in secret [=whore], but also fit for the sabhā (assembly) like speech to be publicly uttered there (cf. the sabhéyo vípraḥ “the inspired poet appropriate to the sabhā in II.24.13). For the association between the sabhā and licentious sexual activity, see Falk (Bruderschaft, 90-92).

Ge (/Hoffmann, WG) take úparā … ṛṣṭíḥ as the lower part of the spear and consider the shared characteristic between simile and frame to be híraṇyanirṇik ‘garbed in gold’, presumably referring to the decorated hilt or handle of the spear.

But I take úparā as meaning ‘nearer, very close’ (so approx. Re) and the point of comparison is how close Rodasī is to the Maruts (“to whom she has been joined, positioned well”: mimyákṣa yéṣu súdhitā) -- as close as their spear, which is attached to their shoulders: cf. I.64.4 áṃseṣv eṣāṃ ní mimṛkṣur ṛṣṭáyaḥ “On their shoulders spears have rubbed.” (The verbs mimyákṣa and mimṛkṣuḥ belong to different roots, but echo each other phonetically.) The standard tr. take mánuṣaḥ as gen. sg., dependent on yóṣā, whereas I see it as acc. pl. Either is of course grammatically possible.

Hoffmann (194-95, fld. by WG) sees sáṃ vā́k as a new, separate clause (“Dabei ist die Vāc.”). Although I don’t entirely understand the position and function of sám, I do not think making these last two words into an abrupt appendage works well.
