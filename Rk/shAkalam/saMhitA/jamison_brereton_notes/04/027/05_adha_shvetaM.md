The first occurrence of mádāya- was omitted in the publ. tr., which should read “… Indra will aim it for drinking to exhilaration.” As noted in the publ. intro., práti √dhā is an idiom meaning ‘aim (an arrow)’, and the word play is surely meant here, given the immediately preceding vss. about Kṛśānu and his arrowshot.
