The Pp. reads pl. káśāḥ ‘whips’ here, and standard tr. follow this, making it the subj. of vádān. But káśā- is otherwise only sg. in the RV, even when plural entities wield it. I therefore take it as sg. káśā and as the subj. of śṛṇve, with the Maruts as unexpressed subj. of vádān. This also makes better sense of the positions of both eṣām and yád: most tr. construe eṣām with hásteṣu, which means the unaccented pronoun would begin a clause. And yád would be too far to the right in its clause: we expect yá-forms to follow at most one constituent. (Of course, it might be possible to interpret eṣām káśā hásteṣu “the whip in their hands” as a single constituent, but this would be pushing it.)
