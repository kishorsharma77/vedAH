The middle of kṛṇvate is nicely appropriate.

The publ. tr. follows Re in taking vājáyantaḥ as belonging to the denom. stem ‘seek the prize’, despite the accent (expect *vājayántaḥ), since we would otherwise expect the part. to have an object. See also Old, ZDMG 55.294 (=KlSch 753).

In its other RVic occurrence (X.163.4) prápada- means ‘front of the foot’, but here I find it hard to assume that the horses are daintily trampling the soldiers with their tippy-toes and so tr. “with their forefeet.” However, since technically it seems that horses do walk/run on their toes, perhaps that’s what the poet intended.

Moreover, IH points out that it would be the front of the horses’ hooves that would first make impact on the soldiers’ fallen bodies.

The sense of ánapavyayantaḥ is disputed, or rather most tr. water down what I think its sense must be. It’s a negated part. to ápa √vyā ‘strip off, divest’ of garments, to √vyā ‘envelop, wrap’. See VII.81.1 ápo máhi vyayati … támaḥ “She [Dawn] unwraps the great darkness.” But most tr. attenuate this in some way that loses the sense of the root entirely, e.g., Ge “ohne sich zu entziehen” (withdraw oneself), Griffith “never flinching,” Keith “unflinchingly,” Doniger “without veering away,” Maurer “unrelenting”; Re (EVP) assigns it to a different root: ápa-veti ‘cesser’ (whose participle should be *-vyant-; he doesn’t deal with the morphology), though in Hymnes spéc. he tr. “sans même s'écarter (de leur voie).” I think we should take the form seriously and I suggest that it means that the horses’ trampling is so powerful that it can kill a man even while he is still in armor (hence my “without divesting”). That the form is underlyingly transitive (as I have just claimed) is disputed on principle by Lowe (Participles in Rigvedic Sanskrit, 277), where he argues that negated participles are (“almost always”) intransitive and tr. this ex. as “without withdrawing.” I would dispute the principle and therefore his interpr. of this passage.
