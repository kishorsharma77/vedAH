The help for which the wives of the gods are insistently entreated (avantu naḥ, prā́vantu naḥ) reminds us of the adj. qualifying the chariot pole / Sacrificer’s Wife in 1b, avasyúvam ‘seeking help’ and provides a type of ring.

With Ge and WG, I take tujáye as referring specifically to the propagation of children, a function appropriate to the wives of the gods, against Re’s insistence that it refers to the production of inspiration (though in his long n. he admits that there is “une certaine association entre túj et la notion de procréer”).
