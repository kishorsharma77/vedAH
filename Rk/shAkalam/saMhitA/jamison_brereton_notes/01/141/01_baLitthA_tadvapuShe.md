Most tr. take the subj. of úpa hvarate to be the same as that of sā́dhate, namely the thought (matíḥ), and therefore must take the subord. cl. as concessive (more or less “even if / although it moves crookedly, it goes straight …”). However, I take Agni as the subj. of úpa hvarate, which expresses the usual crooked motion of fire, and the īm in this clause as standing for matíḥ, the subj. of the main clause and the goal of úpa hvarate. (īm and sīm almost always have real accusative reference; see Jamison 2002, Fs. Cardona, and īm in 3a and 3c below.) The verbs do of course contrast -- the zigzaging motion of the fire as opposed to the straight path of the poetic thought -- but this is the result of the different natures of their two subjects, which are acting in tandem for the success of the sacrifice. That hvārá- is used of Agni in 7b supports taking him as subj. of hvárate here. However, see comment in
