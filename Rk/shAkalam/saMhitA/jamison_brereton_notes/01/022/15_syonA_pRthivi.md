On anṛkṣará- as ‘not sweeping men away’, rather than ‘thornless’, see Jamison 1993 (Fs. Rix). The standard ‘thornless’ interpretation has no real support; I derive the word instead from a-nṛ-kṣara-, to the root √kṣar ‘flow, stream’, cognate with Greek φϑείρω ‘I destroy’. Formulaic and textual support for this analysis is given in the art. cit.

“A place to settle down” (nivéśanī) might have been better tr. adjectivally “bring to rest, causing to settle down,” but this causes awkwardness in the English.

I.22.16-18: This tṛca is marked by minor ring composition: the átaḥ [sandhi áto] ‘from there’ that begins 16a also begins the last pāda of 18, in the same sandhi form.
