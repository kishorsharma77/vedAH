tanūrúc- is, of course, a root noun cmpd., ‘shining with/in their bodies’, but the bahuvrīhi-like tr. works better in context.

kṛṇvaíte is clearly meant as a 3rd du. mid. subjunctive to the 5th cl. pres. of √kṛ, but it has the wrong grade of the suffix: we expect *kṛnávaite (cf. 2nd du. mid.

aśnávaithe [VII.70.4]). It clearly simply anticipates the root pres. 3rd du. mid.

brávaite, which ends the next hemistich (4d). This imitation comes at a metrical cost: the heavy root syllable kṛṇv produces a bad Triṣṭubh cadence. (The grammatically correct form would also, of course, be metrically problematic.) A root aor. subj.

*karaite would fit the meter better, but there’s no warrant for emendation. For a
passage in which the poet simply avoids the middle dual subjunctive of √kṛ altogether by substituting a plural, see comm. ad I.178.2.

The locative string in cd is the usual expression of the stakes -- a type of loc. absol. lacking an overt participle. The full expression is dháne hité “when the stake is set” (VI.45.11, 13, etc.). The string here contains a formulaic pair, toké … tánaye “progeny and prosperity” with three other locc., one inserted inside the formula. On the basis of VI.31.1 (q.v.), where a ca after tánaye better delineates the pairing, I would slightly change the tr. to “when progeny and prosperity [or, offspring and lineage], cattle, water, and fields are at stake.” The two vā-s (4a, 4c), in conjunction with the subjunctives, seem to set out a deliberative choice: “it may be that X … or it may be that Y.” The two possibilities floated as to how one champion might defeat another set the stage for the next vs. (5), which forecloses any possibility that one of the champions, even a successful one, could take on Indra. The two vā-s are slightly off-balance, however, since the first one is located in the main clause (a) to which the first yád clause is immediately appended (b), while the second is found in the second yád clause, whose main clause seems to be, by default, the original pāda a. This seems to me a minor problem: the point is that the two champions (śū́ra-) in pāda a may defeat each other in single combat (b) or in a full-on battle (cd). The first vā would be better positioned in pāda b, but it has been shifted to the front of the whole main-cl./dep.-cl. construction -- a sort of super-Wackernagel’s Law position. Klein (DGRV II.194, 201-2) treats the two vā occurrences separately, taking the 2nd as conjoining (or disjoining) the parallel yád clauses b and c, but the 1st as the equivalent of “the asseverative particle vaí.” This seems somewhat perverse to me: two occurrences of the same particle in a single verse, esp. a particle that regularly appears in pairs, invite a unified explanation; moreover, I am very dubious that vā is ever used for vaí, a particle that is rare in the RV anyway. Even Klein can only identify 6 passages where he thinks vā = vaí (DGRV II.201), of which he finds syntactic support for only 3. That 6c contains a pair of vā-s whose syntactic connection is clearer provides evidence that these two vā-s also form a pair.
