On the difficult word krívi-, see comm. ad I.30.1. Though krívi- is found in a discouraging variety of contexts, our passage is similar to I.30.1, in that the root √sic ‘pour’ is associated with it.

This verse modulates rather cleverly from praise for the Aśvins (stómaḥ, pāda a) to pressed soma for them (mádhvaḥ sutásya, pāda c), pivoting on séke ‘at its outpouring’, which is literally applicable to the soma but, as is well known, metaphorically applicable to the praise.
