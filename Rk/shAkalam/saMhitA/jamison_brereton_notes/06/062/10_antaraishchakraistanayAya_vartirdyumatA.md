I supply ‘to prosper’ with tánayāya on the basis of nearby VI.49.5 (=I.183.3) … iṣayádhyai, vartír yāthás tánayāya tmáne ca, with very similar phraseology.

I take pāda c with ab, rather than with d, as is the norm (Ge, Kü [509]), in order to capture the opposition between ántara- ‘nearer’ and sánutya- ‘distant’. Cf., e.g., VI.5.4, which has both ántara- and sánutya- as well as vanuṣyá-. By my interpr. the Aśvins are urged to come near to us, “because of the distant dereliction of a(nother) mortal” -- that is, because some other mortal, far away, hasn't done his ritual duty, they should come to us, who will. I suppose I could construct a way to take c with d: some mortal’s dereliction of duty would cause the Aśvins to chop off some heads.

But I find it easier to account for c as presented. The last, independent pāda just takes part in the general bloodthirstiness of the last few vss.

Against Ge, who takes it to √vṛj, I assign vavṛktam to √vraśc ‘hew’, along with Whit (Rts), Gr, Re, and Kü, inter alia. Cf. the clinching parallel in X.87.16 téṣāṃ śīrṣā́ṇi … ápi vṛśca.
