Savitar  
Śyāvāśva Ātreya  
9 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 1, arranged in trcas ̥  
Structuring this hymn is an insistent pun on the name of Savitar (“the Impeller”)  derived from the root sū “impel”: there are eight separate verbal and nominal forms  of this root in the hymn. Savitar is also identified as the Apportioner (Bhaga), who  often elsewhere appears as a separate divinity though regularly associated with  Savitar, and what he is urged to impel is, for the most part, a good portion for us.
