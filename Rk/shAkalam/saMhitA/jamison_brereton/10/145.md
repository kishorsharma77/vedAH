Against Cowives
Indrāṇī
6 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 6
Attributed to Indra’s wife, Indrāṇī, this hymn is spoken in the 1st person by a  woman conjuring against her cowife for the affections of their joint husband. In  Atharvan style (and with an Atharvaveda correspondent, AVŚ III.18), it combines  ritual/magic action with a verbal spell. The speaker digs the efficacious plant (vss. 1–2) and applies the plant to her husband (vs. 6), while confidently proclaiming  her victory over her rival (esp. vss. 3–5). A similar hymn against cowives is found  at X.159.
## 1
This plant do I dig, most powerful shoot,
with which (a woman) repels her cowife, with which (she) acquires her  own husband completely.
## 2
You with outstretched leaves, luck-bringing, god-sped, possessing  victorious might—
blow away my cowife, make my husband my own.
## 3
Higher am I, o higher one, higher even than the higher ones.
But she who is my cowife, she is lower than the lower ones.
## 4
I do not take [=mention] her name, nor does she rest by this person  [=husband].
To the farthest farness we (all) make my cowife go.
## 5
I am gaining victory, and you [=plant] are victorious.
Both having become victoriously mighty, we two shall be victorious over  my cowife.
## 6
On you [=husband] have I laid the (plant) that wins victory; I have  harnessed you with an even more victorious one.
Let your mind run forth after me, like a cow after a calf, like water along  its path.
