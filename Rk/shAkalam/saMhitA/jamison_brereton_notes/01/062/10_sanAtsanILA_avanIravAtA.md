A nicely balanced alliterative pāda sanā́t sánīḷā avánīr avātā́, with the first phrase picking up 7a sanájā sánīḷe. Note also that the first word of b, vratā́, echoes avātā́. On avātá- see comm. ad I.38.7 and VIII.79.7.

Again the reference of this verse is somewhat obscure. Are the streams here the same as the four rivers in 6cd? or are they the streams released from Vṛtra’s confinement? (Ge suggests sensibly that Indra gave them the command to wander in I.61.12, though it is their own commandments, not Indra’s, that they safeguard here.) The identity of the sisters of cd, compared to wives, is even less clear. Are they the same streams as ab? or possibly praise-songs (gíraḥ appear with the same simile, jánayo ná pátnīḥ in I.186.7, and in our next vs., 11cd, “inspired thoughts” [manīṣā́ḥ] are compared to eager wives). Again, I think the reference is supposed to be shifting, with the literal streams of mythological time replaced by the thoughts and praises of the ritual here-and-now, mediated by the feminine gender of the words used of both streams and praises. The temporal shift in this part of the hymn, or rather the double temporal vision, is signalled by the repeated initial sanā́t ‘from of old’ and related terms (8a, 10a, 11a, 12a, 13a) and its contrast with the present tense verbs that prevail in this section.
