Most tr. render ab in the 3rd ps., but there is no 3rd ps. verb here, and the phrase is surrounded by 2nd ps. constructions (táva 6e, 2nd ps. impv. gṛbhāya 7c).

Nothing forbids an underlying tvám in ab.

Ge supplies “us” with śiśīhi, but, although this collocation does occur, I don’t feel it’s necessary in this context.
