      <description>One reason for the intricacy of R̥gvedic poetry and the careful thought that the R̥gvedic poets put into it is the importance that Vedic culture attached to the spo ken word and to the truth that it embodied. The elegantly formulated truth, spoken in a ritual context, was powerful. The word for “truth” is r̥tá, a crucially resonant word that, with some reason, some other translators have rendered “order” or “cosmic order.</description>

      <description>The Vedic mental universe is structured, in great part, by a web of identifications or equivalences among elements in the ritual realm, in the cosmic realm, and in the realm of the everyday. These homologies play an enormous role in the thought of the Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, where knowing the hidden connections between apparently disparate elements, particularly the equivalences between cosmic and ritual elements, gives the knower some power to control the cosmic by manipulation of the ritual.</description>

      <description>A number of different words are used to identify the workers in words, for which we use the cover term “poet.” These different terms often in fact have the same referent, sometimes in the very same passage, but emphasize different aspects of verbal craftsmanship. The most important terms are brahmán, kaví, ŕ̥ṣi, and vípra. Although it is not always possible to draw fine distinctions among these words, and there remains considerable disagreement about their application (we two translators, for example, are not entirely agreed on the function of the kaví), the words do point to different types of relationships between the poet and his product and its source.</description>
