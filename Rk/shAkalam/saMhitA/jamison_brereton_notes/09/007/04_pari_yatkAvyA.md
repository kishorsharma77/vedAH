In principle, kā́vyā (and/or indeed nṛmṇā́) could be instr. sg. “… by his poetic skill …”), though the standard renderings (incl. Lü 265) take it as acc. pl. . There is no real way to tell, but in the similarly structured IX.94.3 pári yát kavíḥ kā́vyā bhárate (cf. our pári yát kā́vyā kavíḥ) kā́vyā should be acc. pl. because it is the frame that matches a clear acc. pl.

simile in the next pāda. This is suggestive but hardly decisive.

On pāda c svàr vājī́siṣāsati “The race horse strives to win the sun,” see comm. ad IX.74.1, 76.2. In these passages I think that the sun, with its gleaming light, represents the milk towards which the soma is aiming.
