The apparent 3rd pl. med. verb apsanta is difficult. Ge simply refuses to translate. Old suggests a connection with √sap but without conviction. Re and WG (though both without disc.) must take it as a desiderative to √āp ‘reach, obtain’ (“… cherchent à gagner,” “… wollen … erreichen”). But, though the standard desid. to this root, ī́psati, is not attested until the AV, the lack of reduplication and the short root vowel make the stem apsa- an unlikely desid. (This analysis is also rejected by Ge in n. 8a.) I tentatively suggest that it belongs to the putative root √bhas ‘breathe’, which Thieme (Gramm. Kat. 539) suggests underlies the various compounds in -psu-, as well as Grk. ψυχή (see EWA s.vv. psu- and bhas2 ) and that it means ‘inspire’. It would then be the imperfect of a root pres. (or possibly a root aor.). Though we might expect a weak form of the middle ending, *apsata, this may well be an -anta replacement for act. -an of the type identified and described in Jamison 1979 (IIJ 21).

Old rejects a derivation from √bhas, but presumably referring to the other √bhas ‘bite’.
