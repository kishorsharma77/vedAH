The first pāda of this vs. takes up the idiom ví √sthā ‘disperse’ found in 5b and applies it somewhat differently. Here it refers to all those who were dispersed in various directions pursuing their livelihoods -- who all want to come home in the evening. On jigīṣú- see Narten (Yasna H., 122); as she makes clear, the desid. of √ji in both Vedic and Avestan lacks martial or battle context and is simply about gaining food and so on. See also Heenen (Desid. 120-25).

The verb samā́vavarti is taken by Kü (465-66) as a (pseudo-)passive aor. to √vṛt, with ref. to Hoffmann (Aufs. II.589-92), a form that is attested also after the RV (see Kü n. 884). The lexeme sám-ā́√vṛt is used in the causative of Dawn’s cows rolling up the darkness (VII.79.2), so here I think the nuance is the gathering or rolling up together of everything that was dispersed during the day, playing on the common opposition between ví and sám that is prominent in this hymn.

Although we might expect víkṛtam to mean ‘badly/wrongly done’, I think the dominant sám / ví play in this hymn trumps that, and if sáṃskr̥ta- is ‘perfected, brought to completion’, víkrtḁ - can mean ‘incomplete, not done’.
