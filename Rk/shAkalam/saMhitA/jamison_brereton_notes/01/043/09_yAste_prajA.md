The construction of the various parts of this rhetorically ambitious verse is not entirely clear, and various tr. make various choices. (In addition to the standard ones, see Lüders [231-32] and Hoffmann [Injunk. 260].) I take amṛ́tasya as modifying te, rather than construing it with prajā́ḥ (as, e.g., Ge does). I consider the two locatives, párasmin dhā́man ṛtásya and nā́bhā, to be parallel and to express the two geographically opposed places where Soma will be searching: highest heaven and the navel of the earth (supplying pṛthivyā́ḥ with nā́bhā as often). The larger meaning of this verse is addressed in the publ. intro.
