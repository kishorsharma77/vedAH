A syntactically problematic verse, which has produced multiple interpretations, not all of which can be treated here. It is further complicated by the fact that three different related stems to the highly charged arí- word are found in it: ā́rya- (a), arí- (b), and aryá- (c).

I take ab as an independent nominal possessive clause, with Indra the referent of yásya. The clause follows nicely on 8d: since Indra’s cosmogonic deeds led directly to the birth of the earth-dwelling people, it is said in 9ab that all of them, Ārya and Dāsa alike, belong to him. The expression tiráś cid aryé in c resembles a number of passages containing tiráś cid aryá-, including several in VIII: 33.14 tiráś cid aryám sávanāni ... and 66.12 tiráś cid aryáḥ sávanā. In such passages Indra is urged to pass over the pressings (and so forth) associated with the stranger and come to our sacrifice. I believe that the same thing is being urged here. This requires supplying a verb of motion and also assuming a word haplology of some sort, such as *(aryám/aryáḥ) aryé (so also Ge, though we differ on much of the rest of the interpretation).

Unlike all other interpretations known to me (including Thieme Fremdling 70-71 and two alternatives given by Scar, p. 308), I take d as a separate clause because tubhyét só seems very much a clause-initial sequence. Note that verse-final rayíḥ echoes the last word of b, aríḥ.
