  <p>Commentary VI</p>
<h2 id="vi1-agni">VI.1 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="vi11">VI.1.1</h3>
<p>As noted ad loc., the first hymn of Maṇḍala IV begins identically (IV.1.1.a):
tváṃ hí agne, with the same puzzling use of ordinarily causal hí in the first pāda of a
hymn. It might be possible here to tr. the first hemistich as a causal clause
subordinate to cd: “Because … you became the first minder of this insightful thought
and the Hotar, you made …”
On the stem manótar- see comm. ad II.9.4 and IV.1.16, 5.10. Note also that
the HvN pausal resolution of the word as manóta is faulty; it should end in a long -ā.
Ge construes the gen. asyā́dhiyáḥ with both manótā and hótā, but the latter
doesn’t usually govern a genitive.
The sīm in c presumably refers to the dhī́- of b. The publ. tr. could be slightly
altered to “made it into power …”; so Ge “… machtest es zu … Macht.” On the
infinitival construction in cd, see also Keydana (253). Note the attraction of the
object of sáhadhyai into the dative case (víśvasmai sáhase). Pāda d is also
noteworthy in having three forms of √sah, though two belong to the same s-stem.</p>
<h3 id="vi12">VI.1.2</h3>
<p>Pāda b ends with one of the rare examples of non-concessive sán, nom. sg. m.
pres. part. to √as. Its presence here may be due to an effort at metrical adjustment.
The stem īḍi
ya- is almost invariably read distracted as here, and it is extremely
common in pāda-final position. This is fine for dimeter meter and for Jagatī, but the
distracted stem obviously doesn’t fit a Triṣṭubh cadence. The addition of
monosyllabic sán allows such a cadence here. Note also that sán rhymes with gman,
which closes the next two hemistichs (2d, 3b). The only ex. of a non-distracted form
of ī́ḍya- (save for a lone Xth Maṇḍala gen. sg.) is found likewise in a Triṣṭubh
cadence in IV.24.2 sá vṛtrahátye hávyaḥ sá ī́ḍyaḥ, where a non-distracted ī́ḍyaḥ sits
uncomfortably after a distracted hávi
yaḥ. So, two different solutions to the problem
of fitting ī́ḍya- into a Triṣṭubh cadence.
Ge suggests that the second hemistich “spielt auf Agni’s Flucht ins Wasser an.”
I don’t myself see this, and I do not know what his evidence is, beyond ánu gman
‘have followed’. In this ritual context, the “god-seeking men” “have followed Agni
first,” because he is the conduit of their offerings to the gods and the divinity who is
installed in their own houses. They must go through him, as it were, to reach the gods.
The first hemistich emphasizes this ritual connection: Agni “sits down” (that is, is
installed) as Hotar and superior sacrificer, and the place where he is installed is
specified as “the footprint of refreshment” (iḷás padé), a kenning for the ritual ground
(see, for a similar installation scenario, I.128.1 and II.10.1).
On mahó rāyé see comm. ad IV.31.11. The interp. of the rest of pāda d is
uncertain, primarily because of the multiply ambiguous citáya- stem. The pāda most
resembles V.15.5 mahó rāyé citáyann átrim aspah, rendered by Ge as “du hast jetzt
zu grossem Reichtum dich offenbarend dem Atri (aus der Not) herausgeholfen”
(though in our passage here he takes citáyantaḥ as “aufmerksam,” a completely
2
different sense of citáya-) and in the publ. tr. (JPB) as “…then appearing greatly for
wealth, you have rescued Atri.” My publ. tr. here (“distinguishing themselves”) is
closest to Ge’s tr. of V.15.5, though I think it adds a crucial element. The point must
(or at least may) be that the men seek to make especially conspicuous offerings to the
gods, via Agni, for the sake of acquiring the wealth that accrues to the successful
sacrificer. The apparent reflexive tr. ‘distinguish oneself’ is really just an extension
of the common value of citáya- ‘appear’/ ‘appear (good), be conspicuous’. Re’s
“fixant leur pensée sur la richesse (pour l&rsquo;atteindre) grandement” is an extension of
Ge’s “attentive” sense, but I think he has extended too far.</p>
<h3 id="vi13">VI.1.3</h3>
<p>The first hemistich of this vs. presents some difficulties. One of the problems
is that the acc. yántam in the first pāda most naturally invites Agni as referent, since
the main verb of the clause, ánu gman, is the same as in 2cd, where Agni was
definitely the acc. complement. But in pāda b Agni is represented by a loc. tvé and
there is a different acc. rayím. One solution has been to construe rayím loosely (or
not so loosely) with the pf. part. jāgṛvā́ṃsaḥ, leaving yántam in pāda a as the only
acc. with ánu gman. This is the solution Old favors (ZDMG 55.271–72 = KlSch 730–
31: “bei dir Reichtum erwachend”), but √gṛ ‘be awake’ does not otherwise take an
acc. Both Ge and Re supply a parenthetical non-finite verb more or less dependent on
jāgṛvā́ṃsaḥ to govern ‘wealth’: “das sie bei dir Reichtum (erwartend) gewacht haben”
and “… vigilants, (pour atteindre) en toi la richesse.” Since I prefer not to supply
anything I don’t have to, I’ve tried another tack &ndash; making yántam (with Agni as
referent) and rayím conjoined goals of ánu gman. In other words, the wakeful men
(presumably the priests alert at the sacrifice) pursue both Agni as he comes with
goods and the goods themselves that are nearby him after he has deposited them on
the ritual ground. I don’t, however, find this very satisfactory &ndash; though I don’t find
the other possibilities satisfying either (and I simply don’t understand Ludwig’s
interpr., as reported by Old, 271–72 = 730–31). Somewhat in favor of my interpr. is
Re’s comment that tvé rayím … ánu gman is a “variation inorganique” (whatever he
means by that adj.) of tvā .. rāyé … ánu gman. I would rephrase it slightly to say that
my “they follow you and wealth”(3ab) is a variant (inorganic or not) of “they follow
you for wealth” (2cd).
In any case, the string of accusatives in cd all clearly refer to Agni, and we are
back on firm ground.</p>
<h3 id="vi14">VI.1.4</h3>
<p>Again Ge claims that this verse is about the myth of the flight of Agni,
presumably on the basis of padám devásya … vyántaḥ, but the track of the god
doesn&rsquo;t have to be his flight, but simply the ritual cursus.
How one interprets the larger sense of the vs. depends on how one interprets
the verb forms: āpan, dadhire, and raṇayanta, esp. the first. Both Ge and Re take
āpan as preterital (“… haben sie … erlangt,” “ont obtenu”), presumably taking it as a
pluperfect or a thematic aorist (both either augmented or not) to √āp, and Ge clearly
thinks the subj. is the Aṅgirases. (Gr takes it as an aor.) But nothing prevents it from
being a pf. subjunctive. In that case, the priests pursuing the ritual cursus in a, who
3
are seeking fame (śravasyávaḥ), will obtain fame through their priestly activities. The
pf. dadhire in c can then have, as often, immediate past reference (“they have
assumed names” – presumably their priestly titles), and the injunctive raṇayanta in d
is easily compatible with that scenario as a general timeless presential. Because of
the otherwise exclusive focus on the ritual function of Agni in this hymn, my interpr.
seems preferable to one that goes haring off into the mythological past.
Note śrávaḥ … ámṛktam “indestructible fame” as a variation on the formula
śrávaḥ … ákṣitam.</p>
<h3 id="vi15">VI.1.5</h3>
<p>The referent of the phrase “both riches of the people” (rā́ya ubháyāso
jánānām) is not entirely clear. The standard assumption is that it refers to material
goods of some sort, but which are the two kinds? Ge (n. 5b) cites Sāy on the TB for
heavenly and earthly riches &ndash; though Sāy on our passage suggests rather (domestic)
animals and non-animals (paśvapaśurūpāṇi). Ge’s own suggestion is our own goods
and those of our enemies, based on VII.83.5 yuváṃ hí vásva ubháyasya rā́jathaḥ,
where the publ. tr. (jpb) tentatively suggests rather those of war and peace. Acdg. to
Re, they are material and spiritual goods, which he thinks are rayí- and vásurespectively &ndash; a completely arbitrary and ad hoc differentiation of these two
extremely common stems, not supported in other passages as far as I can see. Ge’s
interpr. is more plausible, but it seems strange to announce that goods of whatever
sort “strengthen” Agni &ndash; esp. as in vss. 2–3 Agni is depicted as the bringer and
provider of goods for us. I have a completely different view of the phrase &ndash; that it
refers metaphorically to manpower. In VI.14.3 the “riches of the stranger” (rā́yo
aryáḥ) contend with each other (spárdhante), where the verb invites an animate
referent for the subject. Moreover, ubháya- regularly refers to two different groups
of beings: e.g., I.60.2 ubháyāsaḥ … uśíjo yé ca mártāḥ “both … his (ancient) priests
and mortals (now)”; II.2.12 ubháyāsaḥ … stotā́raḥ … sūráyaś ca “both praisers and
patrons.” In II.6.7 jánmobháyā “both breeds” refers to the human and divine races,
similarly jātā́m̐ubháyān in IV.2.2. Here either human/divine or patrons/singers (or
some other division of mortals) would be possible, but I favor the latter, given the
concentration on humans and their ritual activities here.</p>
<h3 id="vi16">VI.1.6</h3>
<p>Pāda b hótā … ní ṣasāda yájīyān closely echoes 2a ádhā hótā ny àsīdo
yájīyān. The opening of pāda c (as well as 7a), táṃ tvā, also matches 2c, and
dīdivā́ṃsam of c matches the same adj. in 3d.
Whatever the exact posture described by jñubā́dhaḥ (for detailed disc. see
Scar 343–45), the Engl. idiom “on bended knee” conveys the same sense of physical
reverence.
VI.1.6–7: I do not understand why 6c has the act. pf. part. dīdivā́ṃsam while, in the
same metrical position, qualifying the same entity, and apparently meaning the same
thing, 7c has the middle part. dī́diyānaḥ (whose tense-aspect stem affiliation is not
entirely clear: its accent weakly suggests that it already belongs to the new redupl.
pres. [reinterpreted from the pf.], but the redupl. forms to this root are in flux; see my
4
“perfect impv” paper in the Lubotsky Fs.). Of course a nom. form of the act. part
would not fit this slot in 7c, but an acc. form of the middle part. would be fine in 6c. I
doubt that the poet is contrasting old perfect and new pres., or trying to draw a
semantic difference between the voices. The participle dī́diyāna- is the only medial
form to this root; all the finite forms are active, with intrans. value, as are the two act.
participles, old-style pf. dīdivā́ṃs- and new-style redupl. pres. dī́dyant-.
VI.1.7-8: Both Ge and Re take návyam in 7a as an adv. (e.g., “aufs neue”), but since
the adj. návya- in the nom. (hence not a possible adverb) regularly qualifies Agni
(V.12.3, VII.4.8, VIII.11.10, X.4.5), I see no reason not to take it as an adj. here. The
reference of course is to the newly kindled ritual fire.
Ge, flg. Ludwig, thinks that 7c concerns battle, which again I find difficult to
see. I am more persuaded by Proferes’s reading (pp. 29–30), that the hymn in general
presents Agni as the fire held in common by the larger community and that in vss. 7–
8 “this common fire is a symbol of centralized sovereignty,” therefore a leader of the
clans and, in 8a the clan-lord of each and every clan.
Vs. 8 is couched entirely in the acc., referring to Agni. It can’t be directly
attached to either what immediately precedes or what immediately follows, since
both 7cd and 9ab have Agni in the nom. However, it follows nicely after the
accusatives in 7ab, with 7cd an intrusion. To indicate that the description of Agni is
in the acc., I have resupplied “we implore” from 7b.
On the semantics of the root √tuś in nitóśana-, see comm. ad VIII.38.2.
The hapax cmpd. prétīṣaṇi- is curiously formed and its sense not entirely
clear, esp. because the root affiliation of -iṣaṇi- is uncertain and because the cmpd
type is muddled, at least by its interpreters. Ge takes the 2nd member with √iṣ ‘seek,
desire’: “der das Auftreten (des Opferpriesters) wünscht”; while Re opts for √iṣ
‘impel’: “qui pousse en avant l&rsquo;incitation,” with alternatives in the notes “qui aspire à
aller de l’avant” (√iṣ ‘seek, desire’) or “qui fait avancer l&rsquo;incitation (des humains)”
(√iṣ ‘impel’). The ‘seek, desire’ root is also represented by Debrunner’s “zum
Vormarsch strebend” (AiG II.2.208). In my interpr. I take Old’s point (Noten ad loc.;
he doesn’t discuss in ZDMG 55) that the accent suggests a bahuvrīhi, and I favor a
connection of the 2nd member with √iṣ ‘impel’ and esp. the 2ndary verbal stems
iṣanaya- and iṣaṇya-, both ‘impel’. A literal rendering would then be something like
“having the impulsion of the forward progress (of the sacrifice),” but in English the
bahuvrīhi gloss is too awkward, hence my “impelling …” The point here is that Agni
controls the pace and movement of the sacrifice, which progress is often expressed
by the idiom prá √i (cf. the common loc. absol. prayaty àdhvaré “while the
ceremony is advancing”) found in the 1st member préti-. The 2nd member iṣaṇi- is
immediately followed by the part. iṣáyantam, but I think this is a playful
juxtaposition: the two words have nothing to do with each other, and the sense
‘prospering’ for the latter was established in the fuller expression in 2b.</p>
<h3 id="vi19">VI.1.9</h3>
<p>There are a few small questions in this vs. In b both Ge and Re take instr.
samídhā as referring to the concrete material kindling stick, as often &ndash; while I think
5
it refers to abstractly to the moment of kindling (as also, in my view, in VI.2.5 and
quite possibly VI.5.5). The abstract sense is allowed by Scar (52–53), and the fact
that the dat. to the same stem, samídhe, can be used as an infinitive (see, inter alia,
Keydana 186 n. 160) supports this interpr. It has to be admitted, though, that the
same instr. in the following vs. (10b) does refer to the physical object.
In c my “knows his way around” is a literal calque of pári védā into an
English idiom (cf. almost identical passage I.31.5). (A more chaste rendering would
have been “thoroughly knows.”) In both passages we might have expected
univerbation of the preverb and verb with loss of accent on pári in the rel. cl.; I have
no explanation for why this did not happen, save for the possibility that pári does not
function as a conventional preverb but as an adverb or postposition and also given
the fact that such univerbation is not generally obligatory.
Ge and Re take c with d rather than ab; this is certainly possible and there are
no implications either way.</p>
<h3 id="vi110">VI.1.10</h3>
<p>The doubling of the 2nd sg. enclitic te by init. asmaí, the here-and-now
demonstrative, is somewhat unusual, though in the same general vein as táṃ tvā (2c,
6c, 7a).
Ge and Re (see also Klein I.329, Oberlies II.133) take védī as a loc., but in this
passage, embedded in a long series of instrumentals, there seems no reason not to
interpr. it as the instr. it appears to be. See AiG III.155, where Wack identifies it as
an instr. here. The very similar passage VI.13.4 yás te sūno sahaso gīrbhír ukthaíḥ …
vedyā́naṭ (that is, probably to be emended to *védyā́naṭ and analyzed *védyā …),
supports the instr. interpr. &ndash; which is argued for for both passages by Bloomfield
(RR ad VI.1.10) and Old (Noten ad VI.13.4).
Re (see also Klein I.52, 71) take bhāsā́, śrávobhiś ca as a conjoined NP, with
Re putting immediately following śravasyàḥ into a separate syntagm (Klein doesn’t
treat anything but the two nouns). Although ca does generally conjoin nominals, both
the pāda break between the instrumentals and the etymological figure śrávobhiḥ …
śravasyàḥ suggest that the two instr. belong with different parts of the clause.
VI.1.12–13: These two vss. play on the two words purú- ‘many’ and vásu- ‘good’ in
this final explosion of begging for a suitable return from the god.</p>
<h3 id="vi112">VI.1.12</h3>
<p>I take nṛvát as an adverb, since this neut. is almost always so used. Ge and
Re instead take it as a full adj. ‘consisting of men, accompanied by men’ modifying a
gapped noun (Besitz, la richesse) and implicitly parallel to bhū́ri … paśváḥ
“abundance of livestock.” I am not convinced, and curiously the passage Ge cites in
his n. 10a as support for the interpr. contains a nṛvát that must be adverbial. Still, I do
have to admit that a few such expressions do exist outside of the neut. sg.: I.92.7
nrváta ̥ ḥ … vā́jān, IX.93.5 rayím &hellip; nrvántam ̥ .</p>
<h2 id="vi2-agni">VI.2 Agni</h2>
<p>6
VI.2.1–2: The opening of the first hymn in this maṇḍala, tváṃ hí (see above), is
replicated in the first two vss. of this hymn. The hí is similarly hard to account for in
both these vss.</p>
<h3 id="vi21">VI.2.1</h3>
<p>The etymology and therefore the sense of the vṛddhi form kṣaíta- (IX.97.3),
kṣaítavant- (here) are disputed; see EWA s.v. The question is whether it belongs with
kṣití- ‘settlement’ (Aves. šiti-), etc., to √kṣi ‘dwell’, or is the counterpart of YAves
xšaēta- ‘lordly’ vel sim., to √kṣā ‘rule over’. As the Avestan forms show, the two
interpr. are not etymologically compatible. With Ge (hesitantly) and Re (sim. AiG
II.2.127 [though see 933]), I have opted for the former. For one thing the various
‘people, settlement’ words are prominent in this run of hymns: kṣití- VI.1.5, carṣaṇíin this vs. and twice in the next (VI.2.2), as well as VI.1.8, víś- VI.1.8, and it also
makes sense for Agni, as the ritual fire in the household and the focus of the
extended family and clan unit, to be associated here with the glory of those people.
Another reason emerges from consideration of the whole vs.: the verb stem púṣya-
(see puṣyasi pāda d) is formulaically associated with kṣéti ‘dwells in peace’,
belonging to the same root √kṣi ‘dwell’ (cf. kṣéti púṣyati I.64.13, 83.3, VII.32.9 and
similar expressions); see esp. in this very same hymn VI.2.5cd … sá puṣyati, kṣáyam
… “he prospers his dwelling place.” However, the other interpr., ‘lordly’, is certainly
not excluded, esp. since both occurrences of kṣaíta- are associated with yáśas- ‘glory’
(kṣaítavad yáśaḥ here; yaśástaro yaśásāṃ kṣaítaḥ IX.97.3 of Soma).
The simile puṣṭíṃ ná puṣyasi “you prosper X like prosperity” seems a bit
lame. I suppose the idea was to capture the cognate accusative. Or it can be a
placeholder for puṣyati kṣáyam in vs. 5 and the very awkwardness of the first
expression focuses attention on the “repaired” (or perhaps “enhanced”) phrase in vs.
5.</p>
<h3 id="vi22">VI.2.2</h3>
<p>I doubt that the vājín- of the 2nd hemistich is just any horse. It could be a
mythical horse: Dadhikrā is called vājín- viśvákṛṣṭi- “a prize-winner belonging to all
communities” in IV.38.2. Or a god, perhaps Soma, Indra, or the Sun.</p>
<h3 id="vi23">VI.2.3</h3>
<p>The standard tr. take juhvé to √hu ‘pour, offer’, but this causes a problem
with the main cl. verb, the pres. indhate ‘kindle’, if we assume that the pf. of √hu has
some kind of preterital sense. It does not make ritual sense to offer the melted butter
in the fire before kindling it. Ge avoids the problem by translating with a present, but
this is ad hoc. With Sāy. I take the verb to √hvā ‘call’ instead, since invocations can
be and regularly are made after the fire is kindled. Although Kü follows the √hu
interpr. (605), he admits that the alternative should be seriously considered (n. 1316).
It might be objected that a pf. to the seṭ root √hvā should be read trisyllabically
(juhu
ve), as it indeed is in X.149.5, but as Kü points out (n. 1317), an undoubted 3rd
sg. pf. to √hvā, juhve in I.32.6, is disyllabic. (The sequencing of actions problem
with √idh &ndash; √hu could be avoided if the former means something like ‘fan the
flames’, an action that could indeed follow the pouring of the butter into a banked
fire. But I don’t know that we have any evidence for this sense &ndash; beyond the fact that
7
indhate belongs to a pres. stem and could have durative value.) For further support
for my interpr. of this vs. see immed. below.
VI.2.4–5: These two vss. are in some ways an expansion of VI.1.9: 4ab are the
equivalent of VI.1.9a (for disc. see below); 5ab corresponds to VI.1.9bc. Note esp.
VI.1.9b yás ta ā́naṭ samídhā havyádātim “who after kindling you [lit. with the
kindling of you] has achieved your oblation-giving” and VI.2.5ab samídhā yás ta
ā́hutiṃ, níśitim mártyo náśat “The mortal who after kindling (you) [lit. with the
kindling (of you)] will achieve the offering to you and the whetting of you.” (A side
note: havyádātim in VI.1.9b is the counterpart of ā́hutim in VI.2.5a, but note that</p>
<h3 id="vi19-1">VI.1.9</h3>
<p>also has ā́hutim in the immediately following pāda (c).) In both VI.1.9b and
VI.2.5a the root noun instr. samídhā seems to express priority of action: “with X
(then) Y” à “after X (then) Y.” If this interpr. is correct, it provides support for my
assertion ad VI.2.3 that kindling must precede oblation and therefore the pf. juhvé
cannot belong to √hu ‘pour’. For further evidence for the priority of kindling to
oblation, see II.37.6 jóṣi agne samídhaṃ jóṣi ā́
hutiṃ, VIII.19.5 yáḥ samídhā yá ā́
hutī /
yó védena dadā́
śa márto agnáye, X.52.2 brahmā́
samíd bhavati sā́
hutir vām.
It might be observed in passing that the temporal priority I’m assigning to the
instr. samídhā also accounts for a much more widespread syntacto-semantic
development &ndash; that of the standard preterital use of the gerund. Since by most lights
the gerund in -tvā́(and most likely the one in -ya) is a frozen instr., we can envision a
development of the type “with going” à “having gone,” etc. See my review of
Tikkanen, The Sanskrit Gerund (1987), in JAOS 109 (1989): 459-61.</p>
<h3 id="vi24">VI.2.4</h3>
<p>The problematic form in this vs. is the first word ṛ́dhat. It clearly belongs
with the root aor. attested primarily in the opt. (ṛdhyā́ma, etc.) but also found once in
the participle ṛdhánt-, with expected suffixal accent. It is the root accent that
distinguishes the form here. Old (ZDMG 55.279 = KlSch 738; also Noten) suggests
that it is a neut. part. used adverbially, with accent shift (*ṛdhát à ṛ́dhat) &ndash; claiming
that adverbial accent shift can go either way, simply marking an oppositional
formation. But the standard exx. (dravát to drávati) involve a rightward shift, and in
any case the whole notion of adverbial accent shift has recently been called into
question (see Emily Barth’s Cornell diss.). Re considers both possibilities and opts
finally for the adverb, while Ge takes it as a finite form. I prefer to take it as an aor.
subjunctive (see also Lub, Concordance, where it is so identified) parallel to
śaśámate. Although I cannot entirely explain the zero-grade root syllable for
expected full-grade *árdhat (though see below), I can suggest a local explanation for
the (supposedly) unexpected root accent. The next hymn contains the hapax verbalgoverning cmpd. ṛdhád-vāra- ‘bringing wishes to success’. Whatever the original
grammatical identity of the 1st members of this fairly common cmpd. type,
synchronically they appear to be neut. sg. participles in -át with accent consistently
on the suffix (type bharád-vāja- [in fact, the name of the poet of this hymn and of the
VIth Maṇḍala in general], dhārayát-kavi-, etc.; see AiG II.1.317–20), and the verbal
stems from which they are derived regularly are accented one syllable to the left. So,
8
for the examples just given, 1st class pres. bhárati, -áya-formation dhāráyati, etc. I
would therefore suggest that our poet, who had ṛdhát-vāra- in his repertoire, backformed the root-accented finite form ṛ́dhat on this model. A possibly simpler
alternative is to begin with a hypothetical root aorist paradigm, whose injunctive act.
sg. *árdham, *árd/t, *árd/t should have full grade and root accent and whose
subjunctive should likewise have both: *árdhā(ni), *árdhas(i), *árdhat(i) (cf. injunc.
kár and subj. kárati, e.g.). As it happens, the root aor. of √ṛdh is attested only in
forms where we expect zero-grade root and suffixal accent, but the starred forms just
given are the paradigmatically expected act. sg. forms. Under this explanation, the
root accent of subjunctive *ṛ́dhat is not the problem; its zero grade is. And we can
explain that either by the influence (at time of composition or of redaction) of ṛdhádvāra- in VI.3.2 or by the absence of other attested full-grade verbal forms to this root
(though cf. gerundive árdhya-) and consequent generalization of the zero-grade. Of
the two explanations just given, I mildly favor the first – in part because the poet
Bharadvāja would have been acutely aware of the accentual properties of his name.
A minor support for the interpr. of ṛ́dhat as finite subjunctive, not adverbially
used participle is provided by formulaics. As Re sketches, √ṛdh can take yajñám as
object; cf. X.110.2 mánmāni dhībhír utá yajñám r̥ndhán “bringing the thoughts and
the sacrifice to fulfillment through his visionary thoughts.” The VP yajñám √ṛdh
“bring sacrifice to fulfillment” can be seen as a variant of simplex √yaj ‘sacrifice’,
and √yaj and √śam form a conjoined pair for our poet in nearby hymns: VI.1.9 só
agne īje śaśame ca márto “O Agni, that mortal has sacrificed and ritually labored”
and VI.3.2 (the same vs. that contains ṛdhádvāra-) ījé yajñébhiḥ śaśamé śámībhiḥ “he
has sacrificed with sacrifices, he has labored with ritual labors.”
X.110.2 quoted above also suggests that, despite the pāda break, dhiyā́in our
passage is better construed with ṛ́dhat as in the publ. tr. than with śaśamate with, e.g.,
Ge “… (und) mit Andacht den Dienst versieht.”
Note the sandhi ūtī́ṣá, with retroflexion despite the lack of a close syntactic
connection, as well as the unusual position of ordinarily pāda-init. sá. An incomplete
collection of relevant passages shows that this retroflexion of non-initial sá in ruki
contexts is standard but not invariable: IV.26.4 prá sú ṣá &hellip;, VI.2.4 ūtī́ṣá &hellip;, VI.14.1
bhásan nú ṣá &hellip;, VI.20.5 urú ṣá …, VII.104.10 ní ṣá &hellip;, VIII.20.16 abhí ṣá &hellip;, IX.73.8
trī́ṣá &hellip;, IX.79.3 &hellip; arír hí ṣá. But I.64.13 prá nū́sá &hellip;, without ruki.</p>
<h3 id="vi25">VI.2.5</h3>
<p>The two adjectives vayā́vantam and śatā́yuṣam are best taken as proleptic,
with Ge and Re.
For extensive disc. of this vss., see comm. ad VI.2.4–5 above.</p>
<h3 id="vi26">VI.2.6</h3>
<p>Just as in VI.1.2 there is a nom. sg. masc. pres. part. sán without any obvious
concessive value; unlike VI.1.2 there is no metrical explanation available. The close
sandhi in the phrase diví ṣán might seem to give us a clue &ndash; that the two words
should be read as a constituent and are the equivalent of a circumstantial clause:
constituency could account for the ruki. This is responsible for my tr. “when it is in
heaven” (sim. Ge), instead of construing diví with ā́tataḥ like Re (“s’étendant au
9
ciel”). However, assembling the retroflexion data both for sán/sát in a ruki
environment and for diví with following s- weakens this hypothesis. In the former
case sán/sád generally doesn’t exhibit retroflexion; see III.9.2 dūré sán, IV.15.1 vājī́
sán, IV.27.1 nú sán, VIII.43.9 gárbhe sán (though the first and third phrases are
constituents); V.44.3 sacate sád, VI.27.2 máde sád + niṣádi sát + vividre sád,
X.129.1 nó sád. However, there is retroflexion in II.41.10 abhī́ṣád; ánti ṣád IV.5.10,
VIII.73.1 (though the two forms don&rsquo;t form a syntactic constituent in any of these
passages) and in IX.61.10 diví ṣád (almost exactly our phrase). In other words, the
data are equivocal. On the other hand, the loc. diví regularly retroflexes the initial sof forms of √as, as here: I.108.11 diví ṣṭhó [dual verb], V.2.10 diví ṣantu, V.60.6 diví
ṣṭhá, VI.33.5 diví ṣyāma, and the just cited IX.61.10 (cf. also VI.52.13 dyávi ṣṭha),
though it does not retroflex other initial s-s; cf. I.125.6 diví sū́ryasya, V.27.6 =
V.85.2 diví sū́ryam, V.35.8 diví stómam, VIII.56.5 diví sū́ryo, X.75.3 diví svanó,
X.85.1 diví sómo. It thus appears that the retroflexion of ṣán here is an automatic
product of a rule that induces ruki in s-initial forms of the verb ‘to be’ after diví and
does not give information &ndash; or at least high-quality information &ndash; about constituency.
I have no idea why √as should exhibit this behavior; it cannot be due to (lack of)
accent, since several of the ruki-ed forms are accented (including the one here).
MLW comments: “But maybe it was despite its accent somehow a clitic just as there
are accented 2nd pos. clit. This reminds me of the loss of s in Old Latin comedy
which is especially well attested before the verb ‘to be’.”</p>
<h3 id="vi27">VI.2.7</h3>
<p>The 2nd hemistich presents some interpretational problems, generated by the
standard assumption that jū́rya- belongs to √jṛ ‘be/get old’. Not only is the
expression “delightful like an aged one in his stronghold” odd, but such interpr.
require bleaching out the gerundive value of jū́rya- (esp. unlikely given that it’s
parallel to trayayā́yyaḥ in d and ī́ḍyaḥ in a). Cf., e.g., Ge’s “behaglich [cozy, snug]
wie ein Greis in seiner Burg,” which also pushes raṇvá- into a meaning otherwise
unknown to it. Re’s “joyeux, tel un vieil (homme) dans la forteresse” maintains the
meaning of raṇvá-, but the connection between it and the simile seems strained. Old
(ZDMG 55: 279 = KlSch 738) cleverly suggests that there’s a crisscross word order,
with the son of the simile in d appropriate to the adj. in c and vice versa: so
something like (he doesn’t actually translate) “delightful like a son, to be protected
like an old man in his stronghold.” But this is an ad hoc response to dissatisfaction
with the apparent pragmatics of the passage.
These problems can be solved in twofold fashion. 1) I take raṇváḥ as a pun, a
word common to both similes. In both cases it applies to Agni, but in two different
senses. 2) This reinterpretation is enabled by a different analysis of jū́rya-. I take it to
the root √jvar ‘burn, flame’, showing the same zero-grade as in jūrṇí- ‘firebrand’
(&lt;*jvṛH-C, with loss of -v- before ū/u, as in urú- &lt; <em>vṛH-u). I can see no possible
formal objection to this analysis, despite the apparently universal insistence that
jū́rya- must belong to √jṛ.
Starting with these assumptions, we can take the two gerundives, jū́ryaḥ in c
and trayayā́yyah in d, as the predicates of their respective pādas (as ī́ḍyaḥ is of pāda

a). One of the drawbacks to the standard interpr. is that this syntactic parallelism is
broken. In c the picture is of an battle-eager (warrior) (for a similar usage of raṇvásee X.115.4 and remember that ráṇa- means both ‘joy’ and ‘battle’) who is to be
enflamed / set blazing; in the simile jū́rya- is metaphorical, but of course the word is
literally applicable to Agni the fire, who is the upameya, the target of the simile. One
minor problem with this interpr. is that the simile marker iva is in the wrong
position: we would expect to find it after raṇvá-. But there are enough displaced
simile markers in the RV that this positioning is not a major obstacle.
When applied to the simile in d, raṇvá- has its more usual meaning
‘delightful, bringing delight’, which is appropriate to the son and helps explain the
desire to protect him. Here the publ. tr. adds “to the home” to “a son who brings
delight.” I made this addition because I think there’s a buried pun. On the one hand,
in c raṇváḥ purí (“battle-lusty warrior in a fortress”) construes a locative with the
subject (acdg. to my view of the constituency) and we might expect a similar loc. in
the corresponding expression; on the other, raṇvá- in its meaning ‘delightful’ is often
a descriptor of a home or construed with a loc. of ‘home’. Cf. I.69.4–5 raṇvó duroṇé
“bringing joy to the house,” precisely of Agni. It may be that pūrí can be directly
applied to the simile in d and in that context means ‘home’ &ndash; though I doubt it: RVic
púr- does not have domestic associations. Instead I think that raṇvá- in the
“protected son” context evokes duroṇé, and this subsurface evocation is realized in
the next verse by the phonologically similar loc. dróṇe ‘wood(en) cup’. The
unexpected and unusual use of dróṇa- in that vs. (for which see comm. ad loc.)
suggests that it may have been deployed there in order to play on the unexpressed
(</em>)duroṇé here. This may seem overclever; in that case the tr. could stop short at “to
be protected like a son who brings delight.” In any case, it would probably better to
put “to the home” in parens.
A last comment on the hemistich: I have tr. cd in the opposite order, so that
the domestic half (d) immediately adjoins the “dear guest” of b. This is not necessary,
but given that my interpr. of c involves a radical rethinking of the standard view, it
seemed best to make the new reading easier to assimilate.
The gerundive of d, trayayā́yi
ya-, is a hapax and a striking formation &ndash; in the
first instance, just because of the rhythmic rollout of -VyV- sequences. With regard
to its derivation, as Debrunner points out (AiG II.2.285–86), it seems to pattern with
-ā́yya- gerundives built to -áya-stems: panayā́yya-, mahayā́yya-, spṛhayā́yya-.
However, there is no such verb stem *trayáya-. Debrunner adds the parenthetical
remark “von v. Präs. trāya-,” but of course in that case we should expect *trāyā́yya-.
Both the short root vowel and the extra -ya- remain unexplained by that derivation. I
have only the wispiest gestures towards an explanation. For √trā we would probably
expect an -áya-formation *trāpaya-; however, it might have followed the model of
√pā and √pyā with a -y-hiatus filler instead (pāyáyati and pyāyáyati [AV+]
respectively), hence *trāyáyati. We might then invoke the tendency of roots with the
shape CRā to shorten their root vowel in the p-causative, type jñapayati and,
specifically with Crā root, śrapáyati (both AV+). For disc. see my 1983 monograph
on the -áya-formations, pp. 208–11. So one might posit such a shortening to the
11
differently formed causative to a CRā root *trayáyati, which could serve as base for
our trayayā́yya- here (encouraged by the short root vowels of the -áya-stem -ā́yyagerundives quoted above). But the chain of assumptions and unattested forms seems
too long, and we might instead just attribute trayayā́yi
ya- to a poet’s whimsical
multiplication of -ya-s &ndash; his version of tra-la-la. MLW suggests: “From i-extended
form of *terh1- &lsquo;rub&rsquo; (Lat. trivi, etc.), with double sense ‘to be rubbed’, i.e., caressed,
and also referring to the fire drill?” This is an appealing suggestion, but the lack of
other representatives of this root in IIr. might disfavor it.</p>
<h3 id="vi28">VI.2.8</h3>
<p>The voc. ágne was omitted in the publ. tr. I would insert “o Agni” after
“purpose.”
Note that the first hemistich begins with krátvā and ends with kṛ́tvi
yaḥ.
This vs. displays the same verbal intricacy as the immediately preceding vs. 7.
As also in vs. 7 the first hemistich is less complex than the second, but that doesn’t
mean it lacks puzzles. The principal question is the root affiliation of ajyáse. With Ge,
I take it as a pun, as passive to both √añj ‘anoint’ and √aj ‘drive’ (Old opts for √aj,
Re for √añj)—a pun that we also find frequently in Maṇḍala IX. The primary
connection is presumably to √añj: the ritual fire is “anointed” with the offering
butter; cf. the nearby occurrences of the ppl. aktá- ‘anointed’ (VI.4.6, 5.6). But the
loc. dróṇe casts a shadow on the clarity of this association. Though the stem dróṇais doubtless a deriv. of dā́ru-/drú- ‘wood’ (see EWA s.v.), it doesn’t refer to wood as
a general material, much less to firewood. It is specialized as the (wooden) cup for
soma; the stem is mostly limited to the Soma Maṇḍala, but even in its two other
occurrences in VI (37.2, 44.20) it refers to the soma cup. Therefore, if we want to
take dróṇe ajyáse here to mean something like “(the fire located) on the (fire-)wood
is anointed,” we must take dróṇe as a specialized stand-in for váne or the like (see the
passages assembled by Ge in n. 8a; cf. also druṣádvā ‘sitting on the wood’ in the next
hymn, VI.3.5), whose meaning has been twisted. This unusual substitution pushes us
in two directions. On the one hand, if dróṇe here is meant to evoke duroṇé ‘at home’
in the previous vs. (7cd), we can explain its unusual employment here and the
twisting of its referent from wooden cup to wood &ndash; and even take it as gesturing to
‘home’ here as well, ‘home’ being Agni’s fireplace as well as the home of the
sacrificer. On the other hand, since the soma after its purification is regularly driven
into its containers, we can take ajyáse also to √aj ‘drive’ and see the common
identification of the two ritual substances, fire and soma, that pervades much of the
RV. One of the characteristic ritual actions performed on Soma would here be
attributed to Agni. The simile in b, vājī́ná ‘like a prize-seeker’ works with either
verb, since horses are both anointed and driven. Moreover, both vājín- and kṛ́tvyaare regularly used of soma &ndash; further strengthening the Agni/Soma connection
sketched in pāda a.
The similes in the next two pādas cause further problems. In c the first
question is the case of svadhā́. Ge and Old favor nom., Re and I instr. If svadhā́is
nom., the series of similes with Agni as implicit subject and upameya is disrupted.
The next issue is what is meant by a párijmā … gáyaḥ. Both Ge and Re take it as
12
some sort of mobile home (e.g., Ge “ein fahrender Hausstand”). Although in a
pastoral society like that of the RV such a notion is not as comic as it might at first
seem — and although fire is frequently depicted as burning across the land — I do
not think that that is the image meant there. Note first that gáya- is several times
associated with the preverb pári (esp. pári √pā VI.71.3, X.66.3, though as an object
not a subject, I have to admit). And from its literal sense ‘earth-encircling’,
párijman- can develop the sense ‘encircling, encompassing’. That is the sense I see
here, with the domestic deity Agni compared to the extended family that embraces
everything belonging to it &ndash; a likely reference to the ritual fire as the joint possession
and symbol of the Ārya clans.
The second simile depends on the meaning of hvāryá-. This stem must belong
to the root √hvṛ ‘go crookedly’. Ge thinks it refers to a bird, which has little to
recommend it since there’s already a horse in the passage; others (Re, Th [KlSch
78]) to the meandering or zig-zag movement of the fire (e.g., Re “(il va) zigzaguant
…”). I prefer to take it as a gerundive (despite the accent, which is unusual for such a
formation) and indeed one to an underlying causative. My further assumption is that
the “young steed” of the simile is being trained, by being run in circles (around
someone in the middle holding a rope attached to the horse &ndash; a standard part of horse
training today it seems from images and videos conjured up by Google &ndash; and recall
the Mitanni horse-training tablets with their numbers of ‘turns’ [vartana]). Although
√hvṛ often refers to more random motion, it implicitly contrasts with motion in a
straight line, which a circle is not. The advantages to this interpr. are 1) it would refer
to something that the ritual fire actually does or is made to do: the Paryagnikaraṇa or
the circling of the sacrificial animal (and associated paraphernalia) with a firebrand;
2) it would implicitly pick up párijmā from the beginning of the hemistich, with a
more literal sense of ‘encircle, encompass’ than in pāda c. If this latter suggestion is
correct, as in 7cd the first word of pāda c, párijmā, would be applicable to the similes
in both c and d with slightly different senses, just like raṇváḥ in 7c.</p>
<h3 id="vi29">VI.2.9</h3>
<p>With Ge, I supply the verb ‘eat’ in pāda a. Although Ge does not give his
reasons, the existence of a parallel passage in this Agni cycle gives a clear warrant:</p>
<h3 id="vi151">VI.15.1</h3>
<p>jyók cid atti gárbho yád ácyutam “For a long time the embryo eats just what
is immovable.” Re supplies a different verb in a from the one he supplies in b: “(tu
ébranles) … comme le bétail (dévore) …” But this violates the structure of the RVic
simile.
The problem in the 2nd hemistich is the form dhā́mā. Gr, fld. by Lub,
interprets it as a 1st pl. root aor. injunctive, but though a 1st person would work in
some hymns, there seems to be no personal intrusion in this one &ndash; nor can I figure
out how a 1st pl. “we establish(ed)” would fit here. Both Ge and Re take it as a neut.
pl. to dhā́man- and therefore the subject of vṛścánti. However, this requires an interpr.
of dhā́man- &ndash; Ge “Kräfte,” Re “pouvoirs-d’état” (whatever that means) &ndash; that I do
not think is possible for this word, and, in any case, can “powers” hew? On the basis
of VI.6.1 (also in this cycle) vṛścádvana- ‘wood-hewing’ (the compounded version
of our vánā vṛścánti), which modifies Agni, I think that the subject of vṛścánti must
13
be Agni, or rather some parts of Agni, since a plural is required. I therefore take
śíkvasaḥ as a nom. pl., not gen. sg. (with Ge, Re), referring to Agni’s flames or his
various embodiments. This leaves dhā́mā stranded; I take it as an annunciatory main
clause with yád as the definitional relative clause: “(this is your) principle, that …”
My tr. assumes a neut. singular dhā́mā, allowed by Wackernagel (AiG III.272), Old
(ZDMG 55: 280 = KlSch 739), etc. It would also be possible to tr. as a plural: “(these
are your) principles, that …” A different possibility is enabled by Ge’s suggested
alternative tr. of dhā́mā (n. 9c) as “Erscheinungsformen,” which is more palatable
than his “Kräfte.” If we allow the meaning of dhā́man- to stretch to this extent, we
could tr. cd “when the forms of you, the dexterous one, hew the woods,” with
śíkvasaḥ a genitive with te. Nonetheless, I still prefer the publ. tr.</p>
<h3 id="vi210">VI.2.10</h3>
<p>I interpr pāda a (which is identical to IV.9.5a) as a variation on passages like
X.2.2 véṣi hotrám utá potráṃ jánānām “pursue the office of Hotar and of Potar of the
peoples,” but with gapping of the terms for the priestly offices.
The standard tr. take samṛdháḥ as an abstract ‘success’ (e.g., Ge “Schaff …
Gelingen”; cf. also Re, Scar [67]), but the only other occurrences of this root noun, in
the frog hymn VII.103.5, clearly means something like ‘unison’, referring to the frog
chorus. One of the two finite forms of this lexeme, sám ānṛdhe in X.79.7, also seems
to have this sense: Agni “comes together” with his parts or limbs (párvabhiḥ). The
other, in X.85.27, has a sense closer to simplex √ṛdh ‘be (completely) realized, come
to success’. In our passage here, the ‘unison’ interpr. makes sense, esp. in the larger
context of this hymns (and also VI.1), with the focus on Agni as clanlord of the
separate Ārya clans, which are nonetheless working towards a common goal. On the
other hand, the appearance of simplex ṛ́dhat in this hymn (4a, on which see comm.
ad loc.) and in the cmpd. ṛdhádvāra- in the next (VI.3.2) might suggest a rendering
closer to the simplex here as well.</p>
<h3 id="vi211">VI.2.11</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. forms a slight ring with vs. 1, with voc.
mitramahaḥ echoing mitró ná of 1b.
Both Ge and Re take vīhí as having a double acc., with svastíṃ sukṣitím the
secondary object expressing benefits we seek from the gods whom we pursue (e.g.,
Ge “Ersuche die Männer des Himmels um Glück, um gutes Wohnen.” But this seems
unnecessary (and is not the usual syntax of √vī); the root √vī takes a variety of
objects, including concrete inanimates, as in VI.12.6 (in this cycle) véṣi rāyáḥ “you
pursue riches,” and here I see it as having both inanimate and animate objects.
Pāda d dviṣó áṃhāṃsi duritā́tarema is a reprise of 4d dviṣó áṃho ná tarati.</p>
<h2 id="vi3-agni">VI.3 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="vi31">VI.3.1</h3>
<p>The standard tr. take ṭe with jyótiḥ, i.e., “your light.” Because of its somewhat
unusual pāda-final position, however, I construe it rather with immediately preceding
devayúṣ “seeking you as god.” The retroflexion in devayúṣ ṭe might have been interpr.
as an indication of constituency and therefore as support for my interpr., but this
14
argument does not hold. For retroflexion of te after a rukified or -fiable -s, cf. I.11.6,
7 (I.131.4, IV.42.7) vidúṣ ṭe, I.48.6 (I.69.7, VIII.24.17) nákiṣ ṭe, I.104.1 (VII.24.1)
yóniṣ ṭe, IV.4.3 (VIII.71.8) mā́kiṣ ṭe, IV.10.4 ābhíṣ ṭe, V.38.1 uróṣ ṭe, VI.44.11
(VIII.40.9) pūrvī́ṣ ṭe, VII.3.4 prásitiṣ ṭe, VII. 18.18 rāradhúṣ ṭe, VIII.14.3 dhenúṣ ṭe,
VIII.17.6 svādúṣ ṭe, VIII.44.23 syúṣ ṭe, IX.104.4 góbhiṣ ṭe, X.33.7 pitúṣ ṭe, X.38.3

Counterexamples: I.80.8 bāhvós te, I.147.2 vandā́rus te, I.163.3 āhús te, III.55.22
niṣṣídhvarīs te, IV.12.1 trís te, IX.79.5 āvis te, IX.86.5 prabhós te [VII.99.7 váṣaṭ te].
In other words, retroflexion is the most common outcome of te after a word ending
with a ruki-fiable s, though it is not without exception. Constituency does not seem to
play a role, nor (though this is not clear from the examples just assembled) does
metrical position: all of the non-rukified examples occur first in their pādas, but
rukified examples occur in every sort of metrical position, including, regularly,
initial in pāda. See also the data on retroflexion discussed just above ad VI.2.6.
In the 2nd hemistich áṃhaḥ is the most problematic form. In the syntagm pā́si
… mártam áṃhaḥ we should like an ablatival reading: “you protect the mortal from
narrow straits.” There are several ways to achieve this reading or to configure the
form in a syntactically different way. For general disc. of this problem see Old,
ZDMG 55: 280–81, and Schindler, Root noun, pp. 10–11. Gr (fld. by Kuiper IIJ 1:
49 [1957]) invents a root noun áṃh- for just this passage, beside the very wellattested s-stem áṃhas-, to which our form could be the abl. Although this solves the
immediate problem, inventing a stem for a single occasion otherwise has little to
recommend it, and we should in any case expect accent on the ending, *aṃháḥ.
Others take it as an abl. to the s-stem, truncated in some way and at some period. M.
Hale (Fs. Melchert) sees it as an archaic zero-grade abl. to the s-stem, preserved
from a pre-proto stage of IE &ndash; though he otherwise sets forth quite cogently the
arguments against positing the preservation of such archaisms. Wackernagel (AiG
III.80) interprets it as a haplology from *áṃhasaḥ, an ad hoc solution that again
solves the problem, but rather crudely. Schindler, flg. an oral suggestion of
Hoffmann’s (in turn fld by Scar 135, 300), takes it as the acc. it appears to be,
governed by a participle to be supplied (he suggests ā́√ṛ, on the basis of V.31.13):
“den Sterblichen, den du, O Gott, beschützt, wenn er durch Verlassenheit in
Bedrängnis (gerät).” This again takes care of the form, but requires supplying
material from nowhere.
I also am inclined to take it as an acc., but not via the same mechanism as
Schindler (/Hoffmann), but by way of syntactic ambiguity plus metrical convenience.
I start with the fact that 1) abl. áṃhasaḥ is common with √pā, often final in a Jagatī
cadence; in this cycle cf. VI.16.30, 31 (though these two are actually in dimeter
cadences) … pāhy áṃhasaḥ#. 2) Another, semantically similar, expression involves
áṃhas- and (ví) √muc ‘release’, but this expression can have two different syntactic
realizations: personal ACC. + ABL. of the danger, or ACC of danger + personal ABL.
Cf., e.g., I.118.6 ámuñcatam vártikām áṃhaso níḥ “you two released the quail from
áṃhas-” versus II.28.6 (etc.) vatsā́d ví mumugdhy áṃhaḥ “release áṃhas- from the
calf.” The same duality of construction is found with √pṛ ‘carry across, rescue’. Cf.
15
in the next hymn VI.4.8 párṣy áṃhaḥ “carry (us) across narrow straits” versus
VII.16.10 tā́n áṃhasaḥ piprhi ̥ “rescue them from narrow straits.” I suggest that here
we have a blend of these constructions extended to semantically similar √pā. The
person remains in the ACC., but the danger is put into the ACC. as well. The similarity
of the expression here … pā́si … áṃhaḥ# and, in the next hymn, VI.4.8 párṣi
áṃhaḥ# may have contributed. And I don’t think we should discount metrical
convenience: the expected abl. áṃhasaḥ is fine for a Jagatī cadence but doesn’t fit a
Triṣṭubh cadence like this one, whereas áṃhaḥ is quite common in Triṣṭubh cadences.
So if the poet can find a syntactically principled way to use acc. áṃhaḥ here, he will
— and, in my opinion, he did. Note also áṃho mártam in the next vs. (2d), the same
words in opposite order to our mártam áṃhaḥ, as well as áṃhaḥ in the previous
hymn, VI.2.4.
A less pressing problem is how to construe the instr. tyájasā. In the
Hoffmann/Schindler interpr., it is simply construed with the invented participle:
“wenn er durch Verlassenheit in Bedrängnis (gerät).” Both Ge and Re take it as the
cause leading to áṃhaḥ, e.g., Ge “… vor Not infolge einer Unterlassungssünde,” but
Ge suggests in a n. (1) that it could be an instr. of accompaniment with áṃhaḥ (“vor
Not und Sünde”). That is the tack I adopt here, but I consider tyájas- as something
that might befall the hapless mortal rather than something he might commit (like
Sünde) and bring about his bad fortune. On the semantics of tyájas- here and
elsewhere in the RV, see Old, ZDMG 55.280–82.</p>
<h3 id="vi32">VI.3.2</h3>
<p>As Ge points out, pāda a recalls VI.1.9a with īje śaśamé as here; the addition
of ṛdhát- in pāda b also recalls VI.2.4a ṛ́dhat … śaśámate. In fact, the diction of the
first hymns in this Agni cycle is very similar; cf. e.g., the repetition of áṃhas-
(VI.2.3, 11; 3.1.2, 4.8), the use of the verb √naś (ā́naṭ VI.1.9, aśyām VI.1.13, naśat
2.5, naśate 3.1, 2, aśyā́ma 4x 5.7), etc. Other echoes have been treated elsewhere in
the comm. The two forms of naśate in these first two vss. express mirror images: the
first (1b) has the virtuous mortal as subject, suitably rewarded by attaining the light;
the 2nd (2d) has the same mortal as object, with the verb negated, to express the evils
that will not reach the mortal.</p>
<h3 id="vi33">VI.3.3</h3>
<p>This vs., esp. its 2nd half, bristles with difficulties and has been interpr. in an
exhausting variety of ways (not only the usual tr., but also, e.g., Old at length in
ZDMG 55.283–84=KlSch 742–43; Thieme Unters.; Lüders, AcOr 13 [=Phil.Ind.];
Scar 146–47; Gonda, Ved.Lit. 219). I will not treat these other interpr. in detail, but
merely lay out my own, which is in closest agreement with Lüders (“Ved. heṣant-&hellip;,”
Philol. Ind.: 781ff.) through the first half of c. The general point of the vs. seems to
be, as often, to contrast the fearsome and militant aspects of Agni with his benign
ones.
It might also be pointed out that pāda a, which is the most straightforward part
of the vs., has a bad cadence that is not easily fixable; in fact it presents an unusual
sequence of 5 light syllables: (sū́ro ná yá)sya dṛśatír a(repā́). I do not see any way to
make -tír heavy.
16
The first question, in the relatively transparent 1st hemistich, is what bhīmā́
modifies. Though Ge and Re take it with dṛśatíḥ &ndash; that is, Agni’s appearance is both
spotless (arepā́) and fearsome &ndash; the pāda boundary weakly suggests that bhīmā́
should be construed with the other fem., namely dhī́ḥ. On the assumption that this
dhī́- is Agni’s, bhīmā́identifies the dhī́- with the violent side of Agni.
In c, with Ge and Lü inter alia, I assume that a new clause begins with nā́yám
and, also with Lü, that héṣasvant- means ‘possessing arms, armed’. The opening of
this pāda héṣasvataḥ śurúdhaḥ then is a nominal clause, with the gen. héṣasvataḥ
expressing possession. Cf. III.38.5 imā́asya śurúdhaḥ santi pūrvī́ḥ “here are his
many proliferating riches”; sim. IV.23.8 ṛtásya hí śurúdhaḥ sánti pūrvī́ḥ “Of truth
there exist many riches.” The rich spoils that fall to Agni are presumbly the various
materials he burns.
The published tr. importantly omits aktóḥ. It should be corrected to “(But) on
his own, by night, this one here …” This temporal adverb implicit contrasts with
sū́ro ná of pāda a. That is, the appearance of the militant Agni is compared to the sun,
the light of day, whereas the benign Agni described in the second half of c + d is a
phenomenon of night.
On the famous crux nā́yám see comm. ad VIII.2.28 and my 2013 Fs. Hock
article. Pace Thieme (1949: 51–52) and Lub, who classifies this passage separately, I
believe that nā́yám here belongs with the other occurrences of this syntagm.
The adj. raṇvá- recurs here from VI.2.7. On its indirect association with
‘home, dwelling’ in that passage and its direct associations elsewhere, see comm. ad
loc. Here it might be better to render the phrase raṇvó vasatíḥ as “delightful dwelling”
rather than “cozy nest” to bring out the echoes with the passage in the previous hymn.
I take kútrā cid as temporal rather than spatial.</p>
<h3 id="vi34">VI.3.4</h3>
<p>This vs. continues with the description of violent Agni.
Pāda d has caesura after 3; there are two other exx. of this metrical
irregularity in the hymn, 6b and 8b, both of which have bad cadences as well. Here
the early caesura might be calling attention to the extreme alliteration of the pāda:
dravír ná drāvayati dā́ru dhákṣat. The same is not true of the others.
The 3rd sg. bhásat is most likely a subj. to a root aor.; see Gotō 82.
The hapax yamasāná-, an apparent participle to a supposed “Doppelstamm”
to √yam, does not fit the pattern of most of the other -asāná- stems, on which see
comm. ad IV.3.6 &ndash; in that it neither falls into the semantic sphere of violent activity
nor has an associated s-stem. Note here, however, that rabhasāná-, which meets both
criteria, is found in the last vs. of this hymn (8d) and could have provided a model
for this formation. I also wonder if yamasāná- is not a pseudo-cmpd. of yáma- ‘bridle’
(e.g., V.61.2) and √sā ‘bind’, as if with a middle part. of the root aor. asāt, etc.
(viṣā́ṇa- in V.44.1, identified as a part. by Gr., is better taken as an -ana- nom. to the
same root [&lt;sā́-ana-]; cf. AiG II.2.193). Hence, ‘being bound to the bridle’. Needless
to say, this would not be well formed by standard Vedic compounding rules, but is
not completely out of the question as a nonce inspired by rabhasāná-, itself a nonce.
Note also the phonological figure (yam)asāná āsā́.
17
The simile in c, vijéhamānaḥ paraśúr ná jihvā́m, has been variously interpr. I
take the frame to be (agníḥ) … jihvā́m &ndash; that is, the tongue is Agni’s, as usual, and
refers to his flame(s). As for the comparandum, the ax &ndash; I assume that its tongue is
its blade, extending from the handle as a tongue does from a mouth. The blade might
be found in the next vs. in dhā́rā (5b). See VI.2.7–8, where I argue that a word
missing from vs. 7 is found or gestured toward in the following vs.
The hapax dravíḥ in the next pāda is universally taken as a nom. sg. masc. to
an i-stem draví- meaning ‘smelter’ (so Gr, etc., and cf. AiG II.2.297) or ‘cutter’ (so
Hoffmann, Aufs. 420, to √drū ‘cut’, rather than √dru ‘run’). But agent nouns in
simple -í-, though they do exist (see AiG II.2.296–97), are not exactly thick upon the
ground. I suggest instead that it is a neut. -ís-stem like havís- ‘oblation’, sarpís-
‘melted butter’ (on this type, including those built to aniṭ roots, see AiG II.2.364–67).
It would then be a cognate object to drāvayati in the simile and, on the one hand, be a
more likely substance to be caused to run than wood (dā́ru) and, on the other, refer to
the parts of wood that really do ‘run’, like sap. It might be worth noting that the
much later cvi formation dravī-bhū (etc.) means ‘become liquid, liquefy’. (This of
course has nothing to do with the -í- in dravíḥ, but does show that ‘run’ is used of
liquids, a reasonably widespread semantic extension &ndash; e.g., in English.)
The standard tr. take dā́ru as the obj. of dhákṣat ‘burning’, rather than of
drāvayati. This is, of course, the safer course. But cf. V.41.10 ní riṇāti vánā “he
liquefies the trees” (also of Agni), V.58.6 riṇaté vánāni “the trees dissolve,” both
with the root √ri ‘flow’.</p>
<h3 id="vi35">VI.3.5</h3>
<p>This vs. is comparatively straightforward, esp. the first hemistich.
I take téjaḥ in its literal etymological value: ‘sharpness’ à ‘point’, given
tigmá- ‘sharp’ in 4a.
In c note the phonetic play of (citrádh)rajatir aratír.
Despite the pāda boundary, I take vér ná as the simile with both c and d,
unlike most, who limit it to d. The root √dhraj ‘swoop, soar’ (found in the b.v. citrádhrajati-) is generally limited to birds (cf. I.165.2, IV.40.3) and the wind, and so
comparison to a bird here would be apt. Note also that a form of √dhraj and an
uncompounded form of pátman- are found together in 7c.
Though most interpr. take aktóḥ as a gen. either with aratíḥ, imposing a
forced reading on the latter (Ge “der Lenker der Nacht,” Lü [Philol.Ind. 783] “als
Herr der Nacht”), or with a gapped “Agni” (Th [Unters.] “der (Agni) des Nachts”), I
think it likely that it is adverbial, as it is two vss. earlier (3c) in the same metrical
position. So also Re.
Our druṣádvan-, a hapax, exists beside 2 occurrences of the simple root noun
cmpd. druṣád- &ndash; one of which is in an exactly parallel context: IX.72.5 #vér ná
druṣád (like our #vér ná druṣádvā). I assume that the extension by the derivational
suffix -van- simply serves metrical convenience, since the forms seem identical
semantically. Several other -sád- cmpds have the same extension: nṛṣádvan- (1x),
pariṣádvan- (1x), and admasádvan-, found once in the very next hymn (VI.4.4), and -
18
van- extensions are not rare in root noun cmpds, esp. to roots ending in -ā, such as
vājadā́van- ‘giving prizes’, sahasradā́van- ‘giving thousands’, etc.
The final word of the vs., the b.v. raghu-pátma-jaṃhāḥ, is unusual for the RV
in having three full members, as Re notes. He discusses the cmpd at some length and
considers it a “conglomérat” of a tatpuruṣa *raghu-pátman- (entirely parallel to
raghu-pátvan-) and the attested bahuvrīhi kṛṣṇá-jaṃhas-, tr. “(dieu) au vol rapide, au
plumage (noir)” (I.141.7). I see no reason to involve the latter cmpd., detach the
(compounded) first member raghu-pátman- from the second, jáṃhas-, and insert a
‘black’ not found in the text to qualify the second member. The English designation
“flight feathers” would have the same structure (save for the bahuvrīhi) as
raghupátma-jaṃhas-, that is, “feathers suitable/specialized for flight.” Note that in
this bahuvrīhi with a cmpd first member, “first member accent” actually falls on the
second member of the first cmpd., matching that of the original tatpuruṣa (cf. just
cited raghu-pátvan-) &ndash; in other words, when the bahuvrīhi is formed, the internal
structure of its first member is no longer visible to the process.</p>
<h3 id="vi36">VI.3.6</h3>
<p>The noun rebhá- is generally tr. ‘singer’ and the root √ribh from which it is
derived, ‘sing’. However, as I discussed in “On Translating the Rig Veda” (2000,
Proceedings of UCLA IE conf.) and again in the Intro. to the publ. tr. (p. 78), the
limited number of attestations of the verbal root and the variety of contexts in which
it is found suggest that its meaning is more specific than ‘sing’. That the sound of
√ribh can be compared to that made by birds of prey (IX.97.57) or by ungreased
wood on a wagon (TS VII.1.1.3) suggests something on the lines of ‘squawk, squeak,
rasp’ &ndash; a hoarse or husky voice quality that would perhaps not be surprising in a
middle-aged man in antiquity, esp. one who spent a lot of time huddled over fires.
The verb with which rebháḥ is construed in this passage, rārapīti, is likewise usually
rendered in very general fashion, as ‘speak, praise’ or the like. But again it seems to
have a more specific sense: ‘mutter, murmur’ vel sim. (see EWA and, e.g., Schaefter,
Intens., both s.v. rap). So the anodyne tr. of Ge “Wie ein Bard ruft er … laut” and Re
“comme un barde … il parle-puissamment” (both ascribing real intensive sense to
rārapiti rather than the more likely frequentative) can be replaced with something
both more pointed and more appropriate to Agni, who is the referent here: “like a
hoarse-voiced (singer) he keeps muttering (=crackling) with his flame.”
The phrase práti vasta usrā́ḥ should be read with accented vásta, an old
correction, endorsed by Oldenberg inter alia. Cf. pāda-final vásta usrā́ḥ at IV.25.2,
VII.69.5, VIII.46.26. The erasure of accent here may be redactional, based on the
verb vaste in the next hymn, VI.4.3b. It should be noted, however, that Re interpr.
vasta as a finite verb form to √vas ‘wear’ (“Comme un barde, il se revêt des
aurores”), and he is followed by Lub. That the exact phrase, but with accent, occurs
3x elsewhere makes this interpr. unlikely. There remains, however, the question of
what the underlying form is. The Pp analyzes it as vaste, but Old prefers -o (both
here and for the other occurrences of the phrase), a loc. to vástu-. On -o (from -au) as
u-stem loc., see AiG III.153–54.
19
As for usrā́ḥ, in this phrase it appears to be an anomalous gen. sg. to the
notional stem usr-, whose gen. sg. also appears as usráḥ (III.58.4, possibly also
VI.12.4, but see comm. there). See AiG III.213. The long-vowel -ā́ḥ ending seems to
be the result of “feminizing” the form; cf. loc. sg. usrā́m in X.6.5 (on the pattern of
devy-ā́s, devy-ā́m). Alternatively, since in all four instances of vásta usrā́ḥ, usrā́ḥ is
at the end of the pāda, the length may be redactional for *usráḥ, since the forms
would be metrically equivalent. We should also bring into the mix II.39.3 … práti
vásta usrā, with an unaccented dual voc. usrā referring to the Aśvins, and perhaps
IV.45.5 usrā́jarante práti vástor aśvínā, where the usrā́may be again be a dual
modifying the Aśvins (so Ge, implicitly Pp.) or a masc. nom. pl. (usrā́ḥ out of
sandhi) modifying the fires that ended the preceding pāda – or another gen. sg. usrā́ḥ
to be construed with práti vástoḥ.
Although práti is not found in the other 3 exx. of the phrase, práti vástor is
attested in II.39.3, IV.45.5, X.189.3, so it is likely to form part of the phrase here.
Given its position, it would be difficult to take it as a preverb with rārapīti, esp. since
√rap isn’t otherwise construed with práti; see comm. ad V.61.9.
As noted previously, pāda b is metrically bad, with caesura after 3 and a bad
cadence mitrámahaḥ, where we should have a heavy penult.
The īm in Wackernagel’s position in pāda a is, in my opinion, a long-distance
anticipation of the īm in c, and both are placeholders for nṝ́n at the end of c and d.
This might be clearer if the publ. tr. read “he keeps muttering to them.”
The second hemistich consists of a pair of parallel relative clauses with no
overt verb. It also, quite unusually, shows verbatim repetition after the caesura: x x x
x / aruṣó yó divā́nṝ́n. Such tag repetitions are far more characteristic of short echo
pādas in meters like Atyaṣṭi, and even in those meters there tends to be some
patterned variation. I don’t know what function this repetition serves here. I would
attribute it to the poet’s flagging imagination, except the rest of the hymn bursts with
imagination.
There have been various solutions to the lack of verb in these relative clauses.
Old, fld. by Re, supplies ‘protects’ (√pā). There’s nothing wrong with this &ndash; it
provides a verb to govern acc. pl. nṝ́n, and “protect men” is a relatively common
predicate, as Old points out. But there’s nothing in the context that imposes this
addition; the closest we can come is pā́si in 1d. Ge takes these as nominal clauses &ndash;
“der bei Nacht, der am Tage das rötliche (Ross) der Männer ist” &ndash; which saves him
from supplying an unmotivated verb, but requires nṛ́̄n to be a gen. pl., which I think
we should avoid if at all possible. The simplest solution, at least as far as I can see, is
simply to continue the verb of the first hemistich, rārapīti. The īm of 6a, echoed by
īm in c, may suggest that the clauses follow the same template, and as noted above,
īm in 6a is easiest to explain if it anticipates nṛ́̄n in the relative clauses. Needless to
say, when a verb needs to be supplied in the RV, a silent iteration of a verb in a
previous nearby pāda or verse is often the best choice. And in this case the intensive
(=frequentative) form of rārapīti in b may be reflected iconically in the implied
repetition of Agni’s muttering in the rest of the verb. The next two vss. provide some
further support for this suggestion. In 7ab an intensive in the relative clause of pāda
20
is matched by an intensive to the same root in pāda b, and in 8a supplying an
intensive in the rel. cl. to match the one in the main clause of b also makes sense.
Although I still think the 2nd half of this vs. is clumsy, it may be clumsy apurpose.</p>
<h3 id="vi37">VI.3.7</h3>
<p>More or less with Ge (fld. also by Re), I supply a word for sound or noise as
the subj. of pāda a; see Ge’s parallels cited in his n. 7a. They opt for ‘voice’, while I
favor something generated from the two verbs in this hemistich, both derived from
√nu ‘roar’, e.g., nāvá- ‘roar(ing)’.
The two verbs themselves require comment, návīnot and nūnot, both pādafinal. First, note that the accent on the first but not the second requires that pāda b
must be the main clause to pāda a. The stems of the two verbs are similar but not
identical; both have heavy or intensive redupl. and appear to mean pretty much the
same thing. návīnot is clearly an intensive to √nu (or √nū? see EWA s.v.); the stem
is attested once elsewhere in the RV (VII.87.2), though the better-attested intens.
stem is ánono/u-. The other verb nūnot, which is also attested once elsewhere
(V.45.7), is less clear morphologically. Wh classifies it as a redupl. aor., and
Schaeffer (Intens. p. 147) also attempts to argue for this identification. There are two
problems with taking it as a redupl. aor. First, there is no causative attested to this
root — nāvayati is only found in the Skt. lexica, not independently in text, at least
acdg. to Whitney (Rts) — but a redupl. aor. of this shape should be secondarily
generated to a causative. Second, a redupl. aor. should have transitive/causative value,
but neither occurrence of nūnot has this sense, and in our passage it is difficult to see
how to construct such a contrastive value for nūnot in opposition to návīnot. They
seem to be used in identical fashion. Schaeffer in fact does try to claim that nūnot has
factitive-transitive value, translating návīnot as “brüllt” and nūnot as “Gebrüll erregt.”
But “Gebrüll erregt” is a translational sleight of hand &ndash; simply a phrasal paraphrase
of “brüllt,” enabled by German (similarly in English “shouted” / “raised a shout”).
There is no acc. obj. in the Skt.; the noun “Gebrüll” is a dummy noun. I therefore
think we should take them both as intensives with the same meaning. I do not
understand the reduplication vowel of nūnot; metrically *nonot would have been
equivalent and could belong to the better attested intensive stem cited above &ndash;
though it should be noted that the attested 3rd sg. to that stem is a (pseudo?) seṭ
nónavīti, so the secondary form might be expected to be *nonavīt. All of this is made
more complicated by the metrical irregulariy of pāda b, which has only 10 syllables.
However, (oṣa)dhīṣu nūnot provides a fine cadence to this line, while repeating
navīnot from pāda a would yield enough syllables but a bad cadence, (oṣadhī)ṣu
navīnot, and the hypothetical *nonavīt would also produce a bad cadence.
rukṣá- is a hapax. It is generally taken as a nom. sg. -as out of sandhi with a
meaning ‘shining’, derived from √ruc. So Gr, Ge, EWA s.v., etc. This is perfectly
possible, harmless, and not very interesting. I favor the more daring hypothesis: that
it is a loc. in -e out of sandhi and belongs to a *rukṣá- ‘tree’, found also in the
widespread MIA rukkha- ‘tree’ (Pāli, Pkts.), which is probably a metathesis of vṛkṣá-
‘id.’ (see EWA s.v. vṛkṣá-). So also Re. In this context it could be indirectly alluding
to its source by its position after vṛ́ṣā, which is phonologically close to vṛkṣá-.
21
The second hemistich presents its own difficulties. A crucial problem is the
apparent lack of a verb. Ge and Re supply ‘fill’ (e.g., “Himmel und Erde mit Gut
(erfüllt)”). I follow Old’s suggestion (ZDMG 55.290=KlSch 749; not very
enthusiastically alluded to in the Noten) that we should emend dáṃ in d to tán (root
aor. injunctive to ā́√tan ‘stretch’). As he points out, this lexeme with ródasī (vel
sim.) as object/goal, often Agni as subject, and an instr. is quite common, esp. in this
set of hymns (VI.1.11, 4.6, 6.6 [recall how tight the phraseology is in this Agni
cycle]); cf., e.g., ā́yás tatántha ródasī ví bhāsā́. Although I strenuously resist
emendation ordinarily, the echo of IV.19.7 dáṃsupatnīḥ might have led to the change
here. (On that form see comm. ad loc.) In any case, pace the Pp. (see also Lubotsky
s.v. dám-), I think it unlikely that the sequence contains the accented monosyllable
dáṃ followed by an accented supátnīḥ. Inter alia, the root noun dám- outside of the
cmpd dámpati- and esp. the archaic gen. dán in the phrase pátir dan are confined to
Maṇḍalas I and X. If the emendation of dáṃ to *tán seems too radical (and I’m
inclined now to think it is), I would read *dáṃsupatnīḥ with one accent, supply a
verb, and tr. “… (fills) with goods the two worlds, who (thus) have (in him) a
wondrous husband.”
In c I take the participle yán with both the simile and the frame.
Note the return of √dhraj (dhrájasā) and pátman (pátmanā) from 5cd.</p>
<h3 id="vi38">VI.3.8</h3>
<p>The vs. is structured as two vā alternatives; the reason for this is unclear. See
Klein II.203–4.
The rel. cl. of pāda a has no verb, and the verb of b, davidyot, must belong to
a main clause because of its lack of accent. Ge, Re, and Klein (II.203–4) supply
“become strengthened’; this certainly makes sense, but there is nothing in context or
parallel passages that encourages this invention. Kü (206) goes for a more restrained
“versehen ist,” a nominal clause with predicative instrumentals, I suppose. But given
the twin rel. cl./main cl. intensives in 7ab (návīnot … nūnot) and the intens. davidyot
in 8b, I wonder if the same pattern holds here, and we should supply an intens. form
of √dyut in a.
The arká- of pāda a are most likely both chants and rays.
Pāda b is once again metrically irregular: it has a caesura after 3 and its
cadence consists of 4 heavy syllables (s
u
)vebhiḥ śúśmaiḥ.</p>
<h2 id="vi4-agni">VI.4 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="vi41">VI.4.1</h3>
<p>As Re also points out, the yáthā … evá framework of this vs. and the adyá
and the -si-impv. yakṣi in the evá clause lead us to expect a preterite in the yáthā
clause: “as you *have sacrificed (in the past) …, so sacrifice today.” Encountering
the pres. subj. yájāsi instead is surprising. Re operates with his usual parentheses to
introduce the preterite: “S’il est vrai que (tu as sacrifié et) sacrifieras …” I have
inserted the totalizing qualifier “always” (“regularly” vel sim. would also work) to
enable the future sense that I generally see in the subjunctive. Taking the subjunctive
in a more modal fashion (“should sacrifice”) or, à la Tichy, as expectative (“Just as [I
22
expect] you to sacrifice …”) would be less troublesome in this passage, but I am
reluctant to allow context to dictate function to that extent. I should note that Tichy
does not treat this passage in her subjunctive monograph. IH suggests that the
subjunctive here may show generalizing value, as in Greek, spread from indefinite
contexts (“whoever [will] do X …,” as in VI.5.4-5 … yáḥ … dádāsat / sá …
“whoever will ritually serve, he …”).</p>
<h3 id="vi42">VI.4.2</h3>
<p>Ge takes both vibhā́vā and cakṣáṇiḥ as transitive: “Er ist unser Erleuchter wie
der Erheller am Morgen.” But well-attested vibhā́van- does not elsewhere take an
object or an objective gen. (on X.8.4 see comm. ad loc. [once it exists]). By contrast,
cakṣáṇi- is a hapax and so its value is more up-in-the-air. AiG II.2.207 takes it as an
agent noun ‘Erheller’ and explains it (p. 208) as a nominalization of an infinitive in -
áni; in our passage cakṣáṇir ná “als Anzeiger” is said to rest on *cakṣáṇi ná “wie um
anzuzeigen.” But this is not how RVic similes work, and further a class of -áni
infinitives is marginal at best (see most recently Keydana, Infinitive im Ṛgveda pp.
190–96). I take it as an intrans. ‘sighting, vision’ &ndash; AiG II.2.207 lists action nouns as
one of the two standard values for -ani-nominals &ndash; to harmonize in sense with
vibhā́vā, though other interpr. are not excluded. Old suggests ‘Beschauer’, sim. Re.
The tr. of védya- is in accord with my usual interpr. of this stem as ‘to be
acquired’ (see comm. ad II.2.3) and my understanding of the original meaning of the
epithet jātávedas- (in d here) as ‘having (all) beings as possessions’. However, ‘to be
known’, found in the standard tr., would certainly be possible here.
Note that the phrasal verb cáno √dhā ‘take delight’ takes an acc. obj. vandā́ru,
as is standard.
In the 2nd hemistich it is uncertain (but not terribly important) which of the
nominatives is the predicate with bhū́t. It is more difficult to attribute the usual
change of state sense ‘become/became’ to bhū́t; Hoffmann’s interpretation (p. 136)
as a general statement about Agni seems reasonable. Indeed, I might be tempted to
emend my ‘has been’ to ‘is’, to match the presential injunctive cáno dhāt in the
preceding hemistich. The presence of this unnecessary bhū́t may well be accounted
for by the figure in which it participates: uṣarbhúd bhū́d, which pleasingly has near
rhyme forms from two different roots.
The collocation uṣarbhúd- átithi- recurs in VI.15.1.</p>
<h3 id="vi43">VI.4.3</h3>
<p>The first hemistich treats the billowing smoke and bright flames of physical
fire. The kernel of the first pāda, … yásya panáyanti ábhvam, is almost identical to
II.4.5 ā́
yán me ábhvaṃ vanádaḥ pánanta “The formless mass [=smoke] of the
woodeater which they (first) marvelled at.” Cf. comm. ad loc. In that verse also the
next step for Agni is to become bright. In our vs. I supply ‘mortals’ from 2c as subj.
of panáyanta, but undefined ‘they’ is also possible.
The problem in pāda a is dyā́vo ná. We might like this to be genitive sg.,
allowing it to be parallel to yásya and depend on ábhvam: “whose formless mass they
marvel at like that *of heaven.” But there is no way that dyā́vaḥ can be a genitive,
and in any case it is also not at all clear that heaven is shaped like a formless mass.
23
Old (ZDMG 55.291 = KlSch 750) attempts to rescue this interpr. by assuming
anacoluthon and mixture between the two constructions “Agni has ábhvam like the
heavens” and “they admire A&rsquo;s ábhvam,” but besides being overtricky, in both
instances ‘heaven’ should be genitive, since Skt. lacks a ‘have’ verb and uses GEN X
for such values. (He does not push this interpr. in the Noten.) Taking dyā́vaḥ as the
nom. pl. it must be, Ge and Re assume that dyā́vaḥ ná belongs with the second pāda,
as a simile with the verb vaste &ndash; so Ge “Er … kleidet sich wie die Himmel in Glanz.”
Although this makes sense, it is syntactically impossible, at least as far as I can see: it
requires fronting the simile around the entire relative clause, a major violation of
standard RVic syntax. My own interpr. takes both the morphology and the syntax
seriously: given the structure of the pāda, nom. pl. dyā́vaḥ should be being compared
to the subject of panáyanti. In fact, this is possible semantically as well: the heavens
can marvel at Agni’s smoke that is billowing all the way up there. As often,
assuming what the meaning of a RVic passage should be has led interpreters to
distort the grammar to get to that meaning and has prevented them from reflecting on
what the poet meant in producing a non-hackneyed image.
The 2nd hemistich presents its own problems, primarily because of missing or
unspecified arguments to the verb. In c ví … inóti lacks an overt object. Ge supplies
“Schätze” and interprets the phrase in positive fashion. He reasonably cites as
parallels, both from the immediately following hymn, VI.5.3 … inoṣi … vásūni and</p>
<h3 id="vi51">VI.5.1</h3>
<p>… ínvati dráviṇāni with ‘goods’ and ‘chattels, treasures’ as obj. respectively.
But these passages lack the preverb: although Gr lists VI.5.3 with ví as preverb, and
Ge apparently follows him, ví in that passage should be construed otherwise, not as a
preverb with inoṣi; see comm. ad loc. In my opinion a more telling parallel is found
in VI.10.7, also in this Agni cycle, with the ví: ví dvéṣāṃsīnuhí “dispel hatreds.” Re
also considers the expression to be negative, on the basis of the same parallel, and tr.
“lui qui chasse au loin (les ennemis).” The preverb ví is not found elsewhere with this
verb. IH now makes the attractive sugg. that the obj. is actually the ‘smoke’ implied
in the first hemistich. I consider this an alternative possibility.
In d the verb śiśnathat is construed with an acc. pūrvyā́ṇi, but the referent of
this generic adj. ‘primordial’ is not clear. Other occurrences of both of these words
(√śnath and pūrvyá-) don&rsquo;t give clear formulaic guidance for what to supply as the
real obj. This pāda is identical to II.20.5, an Indra hymn, and it does seem imported
from an Indraic context here. (Bloomfield does not comment in RVReps.) Ge
supplies Burgen (with ?) here, but Werke in II.20.5. Although the former works fine
semantically, púr- ‘fortress’ is fem. and so is excluded. Re supplies “performances”;
he does not indicate what Sanskrit word he had in mind or why he thought it was
apposite. Though it is the case that both kṛtā́ni and kármāṇi appear with pū́rvyā(ṇi), I
do not see how one can ‘pierce’ them. I supply ‘domains’ (dhā́māni), on the basis of
IV.55.2 dhā́māni pūrvyā́ṇi, VIII.41.10 dhā́ma pūrvyám, although not with a great
deal of confidence.
Ge and Re take áśna- as a PN, but I see no reason not to take it, with Gr, as a
straightforward derivative of √aś ‘eat’. Mayr splits the difference in his PN book,
listing it as a PN but noting its likely original identity with the adj. áśna- ‘hungry’.
24</p>
<h3 id="vi44">VI.4.4</h3>
<p>The rare word vadmán- is found only here and in VI.13.6, also belonging to
this cycle. It presumably presupposes a neut. *vádman- ‘speech’, from which
vadmán- was derived by accent shift, like neut. bráhman- à adj. brahmán-. vadmā́
here participates in a phonetic figure with pāda-final admasádvā, where both the 1st
cmpd member adma and the 2nd sádvā match the basic phonological structure of
vadmā́.
The immediate context in VI.13.6 is similar, vadmā́
sūno sahaso no víhāyā,
but it contains the full voc. phrase sūno sahasaḥ “o son of strength,” rather than the
truncated sūno here (the only place in which the bare voc. sūno is found in the RV).
The phrase “son of strength” is hypercharacteristic of this Agni cycle: besides</p>
<h3 id="vi136">VI.13.6</h3>
<p>the full voc. is found in the 1st vs. of this hymn (1b), as well as nearby
VI.1.10, 5.5, 11.6, 13.4–6, and 15.3, and the acc. sūnúṃ sáhasaḥ in VI.5.1, 6.1, the
nom. in VI.12.1. This density of occurrence alone would strongly suggest that gen.
sahasaḥ has been gapped here, but I wonder if a factor contributing to the omission
of sahasaḥ is the two occurrences of ū́rj- ‘strengthening nourishment’ in pāda c,
given the similar, common voc. phrase ū́rjo napāt “o descendent of nourishment”
(e.g., in this cycle VI.16.25). The ū́rj- forms would, as it were, substitute for sáhasin this stereotyped “son/descendent of X” expression.
It is difficult to contrive a causal sense for hí here, and the particle is therefore
not rendered in the publ. tr.
The meter of pāda c is problematic. HvN make the obvious distraction tuvám,
which produces an orthodox opening of 4, but a bad cadence. Old (both ZDMG
55.291 and Noten) suggests not distracting tvám, which produces an opening sá tváṃ
na ūrja-, with caesura in the middle of the cmpd ūrja-sane, and reading ūrjam
trisyllabic (with a medial rest: ū́rj˙am). Although I usually pay heed to Old’s metrical
observations, this requires two highly unusual features: the caesura splitting the type
of cmpd that is seldom split and a reading of ū́rjam that is unprecedented in the
occurrences of this stem, while failing to distract tvám, which is more often
disyllabic than not. In this instance Old’s usual good sense seems to have deserted
him, and the HvN reading seems preferable. Part of the bad cadence may be
attributable to following a phrasal template: pāda-final ū́rjaṃ dhā(ḥ) has the same
structure as pāda-final cáno dhāt in 2b. However, the light final preceding it
(ūrjasana ū́rjaṃ dhā(ḥ)) is harder to explain; of course the -a represents voc. -e in
sandhi and perhaps we can unusually restore it.</p>
<h3 id="vi45">VI.4.5</h3>
<p>The first half of this vs. is fairly straightforward; the second bristles with
nearly insoluble difficulties.
The adverbial nítikti ‘sharply’ presumably refers to haste &ndash; as in Engl. “look
sharp!” meaning “hurry!” Alternatively it could refer to the shape of flames, with
their apparent sharp edges.
In b rā́ṣṭrī is somewhat surprising, whether it is applied to vāyúḥ ‘wind’ (so
Ge) or to Agni (publ. tr.), since it is fem. and both of those are masc. (pace
Debrunner, who suggests, implausibly, in AiG II.2.407 that vāyú- might in this
25
passage be “ausnahmsweise Fem.”). Gr simply lists this occurrence as a separate
stem rā́ṣṭrī masc., next to the same stem identified as fem. It unfortunately cannot be
the nom. sg. of an -in-stem ‘possessing a kingdom (rāṣṭrá-)’ because it should then
be accented *rāṣṭrī́. This -ī-stem occurs twice elsewhere referring to Vāc and
therefore is clearly fem., as we would expect. In our passage I think it has been
employed as an imperfect pun with (unexpressed) rā́trī- ‘night’ to evoke that stem in
this passage concerning Agni’s dominance of the nights (aktū́n), here expressed by a
distinct stem aktú-.
The image is that of a triumphant king marching across territory. Cf. the
similar sentiment in VI.9.1, again part of this Agni cycle, … ná rā́
jā / ávātiraj
jyótiṣāgnís támāṃsi “(Agni) like a king suppressed the dark shades with his light”
and IV.4.1 (also of Agni) yāhí rā́
jeva ámavām̐íbhena “Drive like an aggressive king
with his entourage.” The relevance of the wind is unclear to me, except perhaps to
indicate the speed of Agni’s progress.
As noted above, the 2nd hemistich is a mess. So Old (ZDMG 55.291–92) “Der
dritte Pāda ist schwierig und ein s i c h e r e s Resultat wohl unerreichbar.” Interpr.
therefore differ significantly, and I cannot treat the details of all. As already noted by
Old, some help is given by semi-parallel passages containing √tṝ + árātīḥ: IX.96.15
átyo ná vājī́táratī́d árātīḥ “(he,) like a prize-winning steed, outstrips hostilities” (also
with a horse in the simile, as here); III.24.1 duṣṭáras tárann árātīḥ “hard to overcome,
but overcoming hostilities”; and, in this Agni cycle, VI.16.27 táranto aryó árātīḥ
“overcoming the hostilities of the stranger.” Similar to this last passage is VIII.60.12
táranto aryá ādíśaḥ “overcoming the aims of the stranger.” These parallels suggest
that the frame of the passage is árātīḥ √tṝ. The superimposability of the last two
passages further suggests that árātīḥ and ādíśām in our passage should be equated,
since acc. plurals of both serve as obj. of tárantaḥ in the same formula, and that ā́díshere has negative connotations, unlike some other occurrences of this stem. Of
course, the difference in case between them here (acc. pl. árātīḥ versus gen. pl.
ādíśāṃ) makes the equation tricky, but I think that, in juxtaposing these two
negatively viewed objects, the poet has demoted one (ādíś-) to a dependent genitive.
(That is, rather than having “may we outstrip hostilities (and) (ill-)intentions,” we
have “may we outstrip the hosilities of (ill-)intentions.”)
The remaining problem in pāda c — and it is a major one — is what to do
with the truncated relative clause introduced by yás te. Old (ZDMG 55.292, reprised
in Noten) considers numerous possibilities, none of which he seems particularly
enamoured of, and Ge, Re, Gonda (VedLit. 236), Hoffmann (Fs. Thieme [1980]
=Aufs. III.753–54), Scar (708), etc., add more. A number of interpr. take the rel.
construction as embedded between the verb tūryā́ma and its object árātīḥ, sometimes
by introducing an otherwise unidentified new actor, sometimes by emending yás to
*yā́s to allow it to refer to one of the fem. pl. ā́díśām or árātīḥ. I would of course
prefer to avoid such embedding on principle, and in fact each attempt to produce
such an interpr. runs into further difficulties, which require emendation (of the rel.
pronoun or of gen. ādíśām), highly unusual case usage, or supplying significant
amounts of material — or a combination of the three. So embedding does not
26
produce an otherwise clean syntactic or semantic result. I will not rehearse the details
of all these ultimately unsatisfactory proposals, but simply present my own (also
ultimately unsatisfactory, I’m afraid). I take tūryā́ma yáḥ to be an improper relative
construction “… we who …”, with disharmony in number between the 1st pl. verb
and the sg. rel. prn.; the sg. yáḥ would have been imported from/enforced by the
numerous rel. cl. in this Agni cycle beginning yás te and referring to the pious mortal
and his ritual service to Agni. Similar 2nd position rel. are VI.2.4 ṛ́dhād yás te …, 2.5
samídhā yás te …, and there are also a number of pāda-initial exx. of yás te: VI.1.9,
5.5, 13.4, 15.11. Thus, although the overall structure of the sentence in cd is couched
as (1st) plural, the template of the “pious mortal” defining relative clause would
impose a singular in that construction. (Note that the person is unspecified, since the
rel. cl. lacks a verb.) In the publ. tr. I supply a verb “serve,” but I would now omit the
verb, with the rel. cl. only nominal yás te “who is/are yours” or “who is/are for you.”
The main-clause verb tūryā́ma would have been fronted around this minimal clause.
We come finally to the simile of pāda d, which again has inspired numerous
interpr., which again I will leave undiscussed. The particular issues are 1) the precise
sense and reference of (pari)hrút-, 2) the grammatical identity of hrútaḥ and pátataḥ,
which could both be either gen.-abl. sg. or acc. pl., 3) whether those last two should
be construed separately or together, 4) whether √pat can mean ‘fall’ at this period. I
answer 4) with a negative, though Ge’s and Scar’s interpr. depend on that sense. I
also follow Hoffmann in seeing the simile as depicting a race and racecourse, though
I think -hrút- refers to the curves of the racetrack and the curving course of the
racehorse. I take both hrútaḥ and pátataḥ as acc. pl., but in separate syntagms:
pátataḥ is the obj. of tūryā́ma in the simile and refers to the competing horses “flying”
around the course &ndash; thus corresponding to árātīḥ in the frame &ndash; while hrútaḥ is
construed with parihrút as an etymological figure and has no direct correspondent in
the frame. For the other occurrence of the root noun hrút-, where it likewise refers to
real life curves, see comm. ad IX.61.27.</p>
<h3 id="vi46">VI.4.6</h3>
<p>ā́… bhānumádbhir arkaíḥ … tatántha is an elaboration of VI.6.6 (next
hymn) ā́bhānúnā … tatantha. In our passage tatántha is accented because it follow
pāda-initial, extra-sentential voc. ágne.
In c nayat ‘leads’ would seem to need an obj.; with Re I supply “us.” Ge
leaves it object-less.
There is no agreement about where to construe the instr. śocíṣā. Re takes it
with aktáḥ (“oint de flamme(s)”), while Ge’s interpr. isn’t clear (at least to me). I
assume it goes with the VP: Agni’s bright flame illuminates the passage around the
darkness(es).
I am rather baffled by the simile in d. The vṛddhi form auśijá- is usually used
as the patronymic of Kakṣīvant, one of the great poets of maṇḍala I (e.g., I.119.9,
122.4, 5), but morphologically it could also simply be a derivative of uśíj- ‘(type of)
priest’. It also occurs once (I.112.11) with the rare word vaṇíj- ‘merchant’; that
passage also contains Kakṣīvant (though not in the same syntagm). Ge claims that
our passage is part of “die Sage vom fliegenden Kaufmann,” but the two other
27
passages he cites (one of them I.112.11) certainly do not add up to a saga, and dī́yan
‘flying, soaring’ does not have to belong to the simile as he (and Re) take it. I am
inclined to think that the referent of auśijáḥ is, as usual, Kakṣīvant. His (other)
patronymic, according to the Anukramaṇī, is dairghatamasa ‘descendent of
Dīrghatamas’, another celebrated poet of Maṇḍala I, whose name means ‘having
long darkness’ (=blindness, quite possibly). I suggest that we have here a reference to
Kakṣīvant via the vṛddhi deriv. auśíja-, and this reference to Kakṣīvant then
obliquely evokes his relationship to Dīrghatamas. So, somewhat ironically, a poet
connected to “long darkness” leads us around (/helps us avoid) darkness. I would
further suggest that pátman … dī́yan “soaring in flight” might refer to soma
exhilaration (as in X.119 the Labasūkta). Cf. I.119.9 máde sómasyauśijó huvanyati
“in the exhilaration of soma, (Kakṣīvant), the son of Uśij, cries out (to you),” where
Kakṣīvant, identified as auśíjaḥ, cries out “in the exhilaration of soma.”
If this nomenclatural intertextuality seems too far-fetched, we can take auśíjasimply as descended from / connected to (fire-)priests and assume that Agni is being
compared to his priest (for, to me, unspecified reasons).</p>
<h3 id="vi47">VI.4.7</h3>
<p>This vs. has a number of metrical problems or peculiarities. In pāda a the
caesura unusually splits the splv. suffix from its base: mandrá-tamam; pāda b has an
unusual opening (on which see below). Pāda c is, at least by the Pp. analysis, not only
a syllable short (hence HvN’s rest at 5), but has a bad cadence for a Triṣṭubh; for
possible solutions, see disc. below. Pāda d also has a bad cadence, but a different one
and not easy to fix.
Instr. arkaśokaíḥ unites the instrumentals arkaíḥ of 6a and the śocísā of 6d. I
take it as a pun, with arka- representing both ‘ray’ and ‘chant’, both of which
meanings are found for this stem in nearby passages: in the immediately preceding vs.
6a it means ‘ray’ and refers to the similarity of Agni’s rays to those of the sun; in the
next hymn VI.5.5 it appears in a sequence of ritual items, adjacent to uktaíḥ, and
must refer to priestly chants. In our passage “ray-flames” are attributed to Agni,
“chant-flames” to “us.”
In b, as noted above, the first word vavṛmáhe is metrically bad: a heavy 2nd
syllable would be preferable, as it would in the other 4 occurrences of this 1st pl. pf.,
as well as in 2nd sg. vavṛṣé. Kü (459) plausibly suggests that the original reading of
this form was *vuvūrmáhe, as we would expect for this seṭ root, which was
redactionally changed, as aniṭ forms crept into this root. Note the echo -máhe máhi.
The accent on śróṣi is somewhat troubling, as it is very unlikely to begin a
clause. One could construct such a meaning: “Since we have chosen you … as a
great thing for us, listen, o Agni!” But the most natural way to construe the sequence
is … naḥ śróṣi “listen to us” (cf., e.g., I.133.6, VI.26.1 (…) śrudhī́naḥ, etc.), as Old
(ZDMG 55.292) also points out &ndash; which in turn requires that immediately preceding
máhi be part of that clause to host the enclitic naḥ. Old (ZDMG 55.292–93 and
Noten) suggests rather that śróṣi is still under the domain of hí, but this seems
unlikely, since it would involve an asyndetic conjoining of a preterital perfect and a
si-impv. (/subjunctive). I suggest that the accent was supplied redactionally on the
28
basis of párṣi in the next vs. (8b) and, especially, ghóṣi in the next hymn (VI.5.6d),
both in the same metrical position and receiving their accents honestly.
śróṣi is also the only attestation of this si-imperative, an isolated formation
beside the very well-attested root aorist. In particular, there are no s-aor. subjunctive
forms of the type that regularly support the si-impv. I do not entirely understand how
or why it was formed, but, given the tight formulaic relationships between the hymns
in this Agni cycle, I suggest it may have been based on semantically identical and
rhyming ghóṣi in VI.5.6; as was discussed above, it is possible that the accent of śróṣi
is owing to the same source. However, MLW reminds me that “s-forms of k&rsquo;leu are
very wide spread in Indo-European (Lith. klausyti, TB. klyaus· and there might even
be an exact match for śróṣi in Messapic klaohi. Cf. also srauṣat. Nonetheless, I still
favor an internal Skt. explanation.
As already noted, pāda c is both metrically deficient and afflicted with a bad
cadence. Old (both ZDMG 55.293 and Noten) suggests restoring devátātā, as in 1a,
also pāda final. Though this would fix both metrical problems and would also make
contextual sense, I do not understand how such a corruption could have arisen. I
prefer, and have adopted, Ge’s suggestion (n. 7cd) to read vāyúm beginning pāda d as
vā āyúm, with vā going with the previous pāda. devátā appears several times in a
Triṣṭubh cadence followed by a monosyllable (IV.44.2, 58.10, VII.85.3) &ndash; so …
devátā vā# would be a fine pāda-end &ndash; and the vā can easily conjoin the two instr.
śávasā devátā. The reanalysis of vā āyúm to vāyúm can have been based on pādainitial vāyúr in 5b. Agni is called Āyu on a number of occasions (see, e.g., I.31.11,
X.20.7, and Gr s.v. āyú- def. 2). Although Ge’s idea seems eminently sensible to me,
it is passed over in silence by Re. An asterisk should be inserted before “Āyu” in the
publ. tr.
I do not see any way to improve the cadence in d. The splv. nṛ́tama- is not
suitable for the cadence of any Rigvedic meter, though it also appears there in
VI.33.3.</p>
<h2 id="vi5-agni">VI.5 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="vi51-1">VI.5.1</h3>
<p>I supply ‘our’ with ‘thoughts’ (matíbhiḥ) in pāda b, though the subject of the
overt verb huvé is only 1st singular. I assume that the vaḥ ‘for you’ is addressed to the
poet’s fellow celebrants and therefore there is an implicit 1st pl. It would, however,
also be possible to tr. “with my thoughts.”
ínvati is obviously a thematized Vth Class pres. (see Gotō, 1st class, p. 76).
What is rather surprising is that the athematic stem is found two vss. later, as inoṣi in
3c, as well as in the previous hymn (inóti VI.4.3; cf. also the impv. inuhí in nearby
VI.10.7). It is true that ínvati provides a more favorable heavy syllable in 2nd position,
but I do not otherwise see the motive for using both stems in this hymn.
Note the etymological connections yúvānam … yáviṣṭḥam, ádrogha(-vācam)
… adhrúk, and (viśvá-)vārāṇi (puru)vā́raḥ.
29</p>
<h3 id="vi52">VI.5.2</h3>
<p>In almost all occurrences in which it is possible to determine, animate forms
of yajñíya- refer to gods. They may be the referents here as well: the gods may send
goods to Agni to be redistributed to his mortal worshipers.
The syntax of cd is somewhat problematic, since there is incongruity between
the simile and the frame. Ge evades this by taking the simile that begins c (kṣā́meva
víśvā bhúvanāni) with ab: “In dir … bringen die opferwürdigen (Götter) … Schätze
zum Vorschein wie die Erde alle Geschöpfe,” and beginning a new clause with
yásmin. This is not impossible, but it is unnecessary and, given the hemistich break,
undesirable if another interpr. can work. Various ones have been tried (see Old,
ZDMG 455.293 and Noten), but, flg. Old, I think it is yet another example of case
disharmony in similes, utilizing two possible alternative interpr. of the verb (sám …)
dadhiré. In the frame this medial verb has a passive sense ‘be held, encompassed’,
with saúbhagāni as subj. For this construction cf. VI.38.3 bráhmā ca gíro dadhiré
sám asmin “the sacred formulations and the songs together have been placed (/are
encompassed) in him.” But the same verb form can also be transitive, with the object
expressing what is encompassed or placed. This is the construction of the simile,
with nom. kṣā́ma (or kṣā́mā? see Old) and acc. víśvā bhúvanāni. For such a transitive
construction, cf. III.19.4 bhū́
rīṇi hí tvé dadhiré ánīkā … yájyavo jánāsaḥ “the peoples
eager to sacrifice have established in you [=the fire] your many faces.” In our
passage the object of the simile thus corresponds to the subject of the frame; that both
are neut. pl. makes their correspondence easier to process, despite their different
grammatical functions.</p>
<h3 id="vi53">VI.5.3</h3>
<p>As noted above ad vs. 1, we have both thematized ínva- and athem. inó- in
this hymn, with very similar objects: drávināni ‘movable goods’ (1c), vásūni ‘goods’
(3d). As was also noted above, ad VI.4.3, Ge (and others: cf. Gr and Re) construes
the ví opening pāda d with inoṣi in c and uses this supposed lexeme to argue that ví
… inóti in VI.4.3 has positive value. As I argued there, ví … inóti is more likely to
mean ‘dispel’ and to take a negatively viewed object. In our passage here I do not
think that ví belongs with inoṣi. Instead I think ví forms a phrase with immediately
following ānuṣák; cf. the same pāda-initial expression I.58.3, 72.7, IV.12.3, as well
as #ví … ānuṣák# V.16.2. I assume that the expression arose from passages like
I.72.7 vy ā̀nuṣak … dhāḥ “distribute in due order” with ví √dhā (reinforced here by
vidhaté), and then ví and ānuṣák became phrasally fused.
VI.5.4–5: These two vss. are contrastively paired: each has a generalizing rel. clause
describing the activities of a mortal &ndash; harmful in 4ab, beneficial in 5ab &ndash; while the
2nd hemistichs of each set out the results of such actions. The pairing is further
emphasized by the phonological similarities of the oppositional verbs abhidā́sat ‘will
assail’ (4a) and dádāśat (5b) ‘will ritually serve’.</p>
<h3 id="vi54">VI.5.4</h3>
<p>Note the extreme etymological figure that occupies the whole of pāda d: tápā
tapiṣṭha tápasā tápasvān. For the last two words, see the parallel structure in 6b.
30</p>
<h3 id="vi55">VI.5.5</h3>
<p>I now would be inclined to take samídhā as an abstract “with kindling,”
rather than as the concrete material “with kindling wood” as in the publ. tr. See disc.
ad VI.1.9, 2.5.</p>
<h3 id="vi56">VI.5.6</h3>
<p>The pāda-final sáhasā sáhasvān is morphologically entirely parallel to 4d
tápasā tápasvān.
In d tád may not be a temporal adverb as in the publ. tr., but a neut. acc. obj.
of juṣasva, with which ‘speech’ vel sim. should be supplied. So Ge and Re &ndash; e.g., Ge
“so freue dich an diesem (Gedicht) des Sängers.” However, since √juṣ can take a gen.
complement (though more rarely than the acc.), jaritúḥ may be construed directly
with the verb, as in the publ. tr.
On ghóṣi, which I take as an anomalous -si imperative, see comm. ad IV.4.8,
which contains the other occurrence of this form. On the possible relationship
between ghóṣi and śróṣi in VI.4.7, see comm. ad loc.</p>
<h3 id="vi57">VI.5.7</h3>
<p>This vs. is characterized by etymological figures: b rayíṃ rayivaḥ, c vā́jam …
vājáyantaḥ, d ajarājáram &ndash; a stylistic tick found also in vss. 1, 4, and 6 &ndash; see comm.
ad locc.</p>
<h2 id="vi6-agni">VI.6 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="vi61">VI.6.1</h3>
<p>The subject of this vs. is not overtly expressed, but it cannot be Agni, who is
the acc. goal. Re cleverly suggests that the subject is indicated by the participle
gṛṇánt- ‘singing, singer’ in the last pāda of this hymn. If so, this is an oblique form of
ring composition.
Contrary to my usual principles, rather than construing návyasā with yajñéna
in the next pāda (so Ge, Re), I supply a form of ‘speech’. I do so on the grounds that
návyas-, particularly in the instr., is specialized to the realm of speech. Cf. návyasā
vácasā (VI.62.5) as well as the famous pāda-final disharmonious formula návyasā
vácaḥ (II.31.5, VI.48.11, VIII.39.2), along with fem. forms of the comparative with
different ‘speech, thought’ words (e.g., nearby VI.8.1 matír návyasī).
The hapax vṛścád-vana- ‘hewing wood’ shows the poet’s penchant for the
type of cmpd. that provides his name, Bharád-vāja. Cf. also ṛdhád-vāra- in VI.3.2.</p>
<h3 id="vi62">VI.6.2</h3>
<p>The first hemistich mixes the visual and the audible in a species of
synaesthesia, esp. clear in the description of Agni as “brightening thunder,” but note
also his “ever-roaring” flames.
The standard tr. construe purū́ṇi pṛthū́ni with bhárvan; e.g., Ge “die vielen,
breiten (Flächen) fressend.” But nearby VI.12.5 anuyā́ti pṛthvī́m favors taking the acc.
as an acc. of extent with the verb anuyā́ti, as in the publ. tr.
Note the phonetic figure in pāvakáḥ purutámaḥ purū́ṇi, pṛthū́ni, esp. the last
three words, of which the first two also etymologically related.
31</p>
<h3 id="vi63">VI.6.3</h3>
<p>Alliteration continues, with ví … víṣvak (a), śuce śúcayaḥ (b), návagvā vánā
vananti (cd). The first two are etymological figures; in the third, intricately
structured one, vánā vananti is not, but mimics one.
Flg. Ge (fld. by Re), I assume that the Navagvas are in an unmarked simile:
the flames break and overcome the woods as the Navagvas broke Vala. The gapping
of the simile marker ná would not be surprising in the -na-rich environment of the
figure noted above: návagvā vánā vananti: we might have expected divyā́*ná
návagvā, and haplology would not be surprising.
The identity of the root found in tuvi-mrakṣá- is disputed; see EWA s.v.
MARC, with √mṛc ‘harm’, √mṛj ‘wipe’, and √mṛś ‘touch’ all possibly in play. √mṛc
‘harm’ seems the most likely to me. The Schwebeablaut outcome -mrakṣ- is standard
when -kṣ- ending the root syllable would yield a super-heavy cluster *-rkṣ. Cf.
drakṣyati (not *darkṣyati) to √dṛś (see AiG I.212–13). Any of the roots just listed
would follow this pattern.</p>
<h3 id="vi64">VI.6.4</h3>
<p>In my view (flg. Re), the rel. cl. of the first hemistich hangs off the previous
vs. 3 and supplies the subject (śúcayaḥ ‘flames’) of vananti in 3d. However, Ge takes
the rel. prn. yé as a stand-in for ‘wenn’, providing a subordinate clause to cd, with its
resumptive ádha. The conspicuous alliteration of vs. 3, continued here (4a) —
śukrā́saḥ śúcayaḥ śuciṣṃah, also a triple etymological figure — might be a weak arg.
in favor of a connection with vs. 3, esp. 3b śuce śúcayaḥ.
In b kṣā́m must be read disyllabically.
In the publ. tr. “like” should be enclosed in parens, as there is no overt simile
marker in b. The question is why the flames are likened to “unharnessed horses”
(víṣitāso áśvāḥ). Ge and Re think they are grazing, and this interpr. might fit well
with vápanti ‘shear, shave’ &ndash; a slightly different image of what happens to
vegetation when fire moves across the earth: grazing “shears” the grasses like
shaving does. However, I tend to think that víṣita- adds a different semantic
dimension: horses out of harness racing about wildly without control.
In d the standard view (e.g., Ge, Re, Macd [Hymns, p. 74], Klein [DGRV
II.106], Mau [p. 24]), fld. also in the publ. tr., is that the gen. pṛ́śneḥ, lit. ‘speckled,
dappled’, refers to the earth. And this seems perfectly reasonable. However, it should
be noted that pṛ́śni- is nowhere else unambiguously used of the earth in the RV.
Though Re (comm. ad loc.) suggests that there is such a ref. in IV.5.7, 10, those are
desperately obscure passages and nothing can be built upon them. Generally pṛ́śninames the mother of the Maruts, who seems to have been a dappled cow, and
“dappled (cow)” à “earth” is not a difficult step in RVic discourse. Still it should be
kept in mind that it’s a step that hasn’t been taken elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="vi65">VI.6.5</h3>
<p>The rendering of goṣu-yúdh- as ‘cattle-raider’ loses the specificity of the loc.
pl. 1st member, but ‘of the one battling for cattle’ seemed excessively heavy.
The hapax kṣātí- is built to √kṣā ‘burn’. I have borrowed the felicitous
bilingual pun ‘ardor’ from Maurer.
32
On Gotō’s posited √di ‘destroy’ supposedly found in dayate here, see comm.
ad III.34.1. There is no need for a separate root, as ‘divides’ à ‘fragments’ is a
plausible semantic pathway.</p>
<h3 id="vi66">VI.6.6</h3>
<p>This vs. has a number of connections with phraseology elsewhere in this
Agni cycle: ā́… bhānumádbhiḥ … tatántha (VI.4.6): ā́bhānúnā … tatantha (6a);
dhṛṣatā́(3d, 6b); spṛ́dho bādhasva (VI.5.6): bādhasva … spṛ́dhaḥ (6cd, though with
the two forms belonging to separate clauses, not a VP as in 5.6); vanuṣyā́t (VI.5.4):
vanuṣyán vanúṣaḥ (6d).
The referent of the gen. phrase mahás todásya ‘great goad’ is not entirely
clear &ndash; some take it as some feature of Agni (e.g., Ge), others as the sun (e.g., Mau).
Most construe it with bhānúnā (as I do), though Re takes it with pā́rthivāni jráyāṃsi.
If, as is likely, it goes with bhānúnā, this provides a good clue to its identity. The
bahuvrīhi svàr-bhānu-‘having the radiance of the sun’ is obviously based on a
genitival tatpuruṣa *svar-bhānú- ‘radiance of the sun’, and GEN. bhānú- would
simply be the analytic version of this cmpd., with the phrase mahás todásya
substituted for putative gen. *sū́raḥ or *sū́ryasya. VI.4.6 ā́
sū́
ryo ná bhānumádbhir
arkaíḥ “like the sun with its radiant rays” provides further support for this interpr.
Although it is true that in nearby VI.12.1, 3 the ‘goad’ (todá-) appears to be Agni, the
qualifier ‘great’ in “great goad” here might point to the cosmic body, the sun, of
which the earthly fire is a less powerful earthly counterpart.</p>
<h3 id="vi67">VI.6.7</h3>
<p>The insistent etymological alliteration in this vs. seems to me inartful overkill,
though it certainly provides an explosive climax. The forms of √cit in the first
hemistich — citra citráṃ citáyantam …, cítrakṣatra citrátamam — give way to
√cand in a slightly more restrained array, candrám … cándra candrā́bhiḥ. Since
both roots belong to the same semantic sphere and begin with c, the difference in
effect between the hemistichs is minimal.
It is not clear what should be supplied with the fem. instr. pl. candrā́bhiḥ. The
standard tr. use ‘flames’, and I’ve followed suit, but śúci-, which figured in vss. 3-4,
is unfortunately masc. when used as a noun. Re suggests alternatively stutíbhiḥ
‘praises’ (fld. by Mau), pointing to the adjacent gṛṇaté ‘singer’, but it is more natural
to take the instr. candrā́bhiḥ with Agni syntactically, rather than construing it with
the dat. participle, and further, candrá- seems never to be used with verbal products.
VI.7 Agni Vaiśvānara
As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn is heavily seeded with forms of √jan
‘beget, be born’. The epithet vaiśvānará- is also found in every vs. (1b, 2c, 3c, 4d, 5a,
6a, 7a), in all cases initial in its pāda.
VI.7.1–2: These two vss. are paired, both ending with janayanta devā́ḥ and sharing
an opening pāda with the structure ACC SG + GEN ACC SG + GEN; this NP structure is
also found at the end of 1c and 2c (one iteration each), but is upended by GEN + ACC
SG yajñásya ketúm in 2d. It is perhaps a measure of the sensitivity of the RV to subtle
33
patterns that this syntactic metathesis feels strikingly disruptive. It may well be that
the poet generated this disruptive order in order to call attention to this very phrase;
see the importance of the word ketú- in vss. 5 and 6, with the comm. there. There is
an important difference, however: here the “beacon of the sacrifice” must be Agni,
whereas in vss. 5–6 it is the sun.
There are only three finite verbs in this two-vs. sequence, all injunctives: 1d
janayanta, 2b abhí sáṃ navanta, 2d janayanta. The temporal reference is therefore
unspecified. I tr. them as preterites (as do Ge and Re) on the assumption that Agni’s
begetting by the gods happened only once in the mythological past. It would be
different if priests were the subject.</p>
<h3 id="vi71">VI.7.1</h3>
<p>Since Agni is often called the mouth of the gods, Ge (and others) assume that
the loc. āsán in d refers to Agni, and the gods have produced a drinking cup (pā́tram)
to put in his mouth. But this requires Ge to treat the three-pāda accusative phrase that
opens the hymn and refers to Agni as grammatically untethered, as an anacoluthon
with the referent picked up in the loc. in pāda d (see his n. 1d). But, with Re, I see no
reason why Agni cannot be conceptualized here as the cup that the gods drink from.
Re considers āsán simply an attribute limiting the pā́tra-, a “récipient pour la bouche,
récipient à boire,” while I take it as referring to the gods’ (collective) mouth.
Note the phonologically matching words aratím and átithim stationed in the
same metrical position in pādas a and c.</p>
<h3 id="vi72">VI.7.2</h3>
<p>On mahā́m as acc. sg. masc. see AiG III.251, EWA s.v. mahā́nt, p. 338.
The paradox of calling fire “a great watering trough” (āhāvá-) simply
sharpens the slightly discordant image in 1c of Agni as ‘cup’. Although āhāvá- is
clearly derived from ā́√hu, a standard lexeme for the oblations that Agni would be
receiving, this particular noun is associated with a well in X.101.5 and is therefore
associated with more mundane acts of pouring water (which of course should
extinguish fire). Agni is a trough because the gods get their “water” there.
VI.7.3–5: The middle of the hymn is characterized by initial (or modified initial)
forms of the 2nd sg. prn.: 3a tvát, 3b tvát, 3c VOC tvám, 4a tvā́m, 4c táva, 5a VOC táva.</p>
<h3 id="vi74">VI.7.4</h3>
<p>abhí sáṃ navante reprises abhí sáṃ navanta of 2b and perhaps confirms the
preterital interpr. of that injunctive, since the verb in this vs. is marked as pres.,
though the gods are also subject here. However, how to interpret the tense values in
the 2nd hemistich is unclear. Pāda c has an unambiguous impf. āyan, which, with its
goal of immortality (amṛtatvám), would seem to refer to the remote mythological
past (though see below). The verb is the last pāda, ádīdeḥ, can be either a plupf. (to
the older stative pf. dīdā́ya) or an impf. to the new redupl. pres. remodeled from the
pf. stem (Kü opts for the impf.; see 228). But whatever its morphological identity, it
seems to refer to an event in the immediate past or the immediate neighborhood &ndash;
assuming that pitróḥ refers to the two kindling sticks &ndash; namely, the regularly
repeated kindling of the fire. This interpr. would be supported by 5c with pres. part.:
34
jā́yamānaḥ pitrór upásthe “being born in the lap of your two parents.” In the publ. tr.
I assumed that the first hemistich refers to the regular kindling of the fire and the
gods’ response, while the 2nd one refers to the Ur-kindling in mythological time.
However, I now wonder if we should interpret the abstract amṛtatvám in c in light of
the voc. amṛta in pāda a. In the first hemistich Agni is addressed as “immortal one”
when he is being born and the gods cry out to him; indeed the voc. “o immortal one”
might be the content of their cry, expressed in the verb abhí sáṃ navante. In the
second hemistich the gods went to immortality (amṛtatvám), that is, to the abstract
quality possessed by the one addressed as amṛta, and they did so “according to your
[=Agni’s] intentions” (táva krátubhiḥ), again when he was born. The gods’ journey
to amṛtatvám may therefore not be one of the distant mythic past (or not only of the
distant past), but one they undertake whenever he is kindled. The abstract principle
of immortality may also be found in the gen. amṛ́tasya in the last pāda of the hymn
(7d), where Agni is identified as its protector.
Note that the phrase víśve … devā́ḥ, parcelled out over two pādas, may
teasingly invite us to connect the first term, víśve, with the dominant epithet in this
hymn, vaiśvānará-.</p>
<h3 id="vi75">VI.7.5</h3>
<p>The disjunction between pf. dadharṣa in the main clause of b and impf.
ávindaḥ in the subord. cl. of d is likewise a bit disturbing. Flg. Kü (266), the publ. tr.
renders the perfect presentially as “ventures against,” but I might be tempted to
change that now to “has ventured against” (cf. Ge’s “… hat noch keiner angetastet”).
The question is what is the relationship between the two clauses. I think that Agni’s
vratás are those that he established after he discovered (ávindaḥ) the phenomenon in
d.
This in turn raises the question of what that phenomenon is and, more
precisely, to which noun (ketúm or vayúneṣu) the gen. áhnām belongs. Most (Ge, Re,
Old) take it with vayúneṣu; cf., e.g., Re “quand … tu eus découvert le signallumineux pour les jalonnements des jours.” Old, who should know better, even cites
word order as support of this interpr. And certainly áhnām does (once) occur with
vayúna-: II.19.3 aktúnā́hnāṇ vayúnāni sādhat “He perfected the patterns of the days
through the night.” But far more often áhnām limits ketú-, several times in a
Vaiśvānara context: VII.5.5 vaiśvānarám uṣásāṃ ketúm áhnām “V., the beacon of the
dawns and of the days”; X.88.12 vaiśvānaráṃ ketúm áhnām akṛnvan “they made V.
the beacon of the days.” Cf. also III.34.4 ketúm áhnām, X.85.19 áhnāṃ ketúr uṣásām,
and VI.39.3 imáṃ ketúm adadhur nū́
cid áhnāṃ, this last with separation between the
noun and its gen. as in our passage. In my interpr. of this pāda the vayúna- are the
ritual patterns, the regularly repeated sequence of events in the ritual, including the
kindling of the fire. The “beacon of the days” is the sun, which rises at that kindling.
(clarified in the next vs.), in contrast to the “beacon of the sacrifice” in 2d, which is
Agni. Note that Agni, addressed as Vaiśvānara, is here distinct from the sun, which
he finds. (See further ad vs. 6.). Finding the beacon of the days in the (ritual) patterns
means recognizing and replicating the regular rising of the sun that coincides with
35
the kindling of the ritual fire. As usual in Rigvedic discourse the correct performance
of ritual governs the rhythms of the natural world.
To return to the question of the relationship between the two hemistichs, I
suggest that the “great vratás” of Agni that no one has/does venture against are the
ritual patterns, esp. the dawn kindling, which in turn control the repeated return of
the “beacon of the days.”</p>
<h3 id="vi76">VI.7.6</h3>
<p>This vs. continues, and clarifies, the theme of the 2nd hemistich of vs. 5.
Although Agni as Vaiśvānara is often identified with the sun and although several of
the passages cited immediately above, ad 5d, identify Vaiśvānara with the “beacon of
the days,” here Agni Vaiśvānara is separate from the sun (as indeed he was in 5cd),
which is his eye (vaiśvānarásya … cákṣasā) and which is further characterized as
“the beacon of the immortal one” (amṛ́tasya ketúnā), taking up the ketú- of 5d, which
Agni found. The sun “measures out the backs of heaven” by crossing the sky on his
daily passage.
In c the referent of tásya in the phrase tásya … mūrdháni “on his head / on the
head of this one” is not specified and could either be the sun, as expressed by the
instr. of ab, or Agni Vaiśvānara. It is surely the latter, however: mūrdháni echoes the
first word of the hymn, mūrdhā́nam, which refers to Agni himself as the “head of
heaven.” And the víśvā bhúvanāni “all creatures” who take their place on this head
are a twist on Agni’s epithet vaiśvānará- ‘belonging to all men’, which dominates
this hymn.
On the formation of visrúh-, which occurs only here and in V.44.3, see comm.
ad V.44.3, where I connect it (as a number of others do) to √ru(d)h ‘grow’. In our
passage this etymological connection is actualized in the figure ruruhuḥ … visrúhaḥ,
and the vegetative image is further anchored by the simile vayā́iva “like twigs.”
With Re (and Kellens, Noms. rac., 82–83), I think the ‘outgrowths’ are Agni’s flames,
but unlike those two I would not translate visrúhaḥ as ‘flames’: it’s a metaphor.</p>
<h3 id="vi77">VI.7.7</h3>
<p>In this vs. the subject of the cosmogonic ví √mā ‘measure out’ is Agni
Vaiśvānara, not the sun, as in the immediately preceding vs., and the more usual
identification of Agni Vaiśvānara with the sun seems to have reasserted itself. See
VI.8.2.
In a sukrátuḥ reprises krátubhiḥ in 4c, and it might have been better to render
the krátu- in the same way &ndash; either as “by your resolutions” … “the very resolute
one” or “by your intentions” … “he of good intention.”
VI.8 Agni Vaiśvānara
This hymn, like the last, is dedicated to Agni Vaiśvānara and has a form of
this epithet in every vs. but 5, always pāda-initial as in VI.7. However, the hymn is
somewhat different from VI.7. In that hymn Agni Vaiśvānara was distinct from and
dominated the sun (see esp. VI.7.5–6) until the last vs., while in this hymn the usual
identification of Agni Vaiśvānara and the sun is in evidence. See esp. vs. 2.
36
As noted in the publ. intro., the hymn is also heavy with initial v’s, esp. in the
earlier parts of the hymn, which index the epithet. Note esp. the three hemistichs that
begin with the preverb ví (2c, 3a, 3c), as well as 1ab … vṛ́ṣnaḥ … vocaṃ vidáthā …,
2ab … vyòmani, vratā́ni … vratapā́…, 3cd … avartayad, vaiśvānaró víśvam …
vṛ́ṣṇyam.</p>
<h3 id="vi81">VI.8.1</h3>
<p>On pṛ̥kṣá- see comm. ad II.34.3.</p>
<h3 id="vi82">VI.8.2</h3>
<p>Here Agni Vaiśvānara is “being born in highest distant heaven” (jā́yamanaḥ
paramé vyòmani), presumably in the form of the sun, in contrast to VI.7.5 with the
same participle but a different location: jā́yamānaḥ pitrór upásthe “being born in the
lap of your parents,” usually a kenning for the ritual kindling sticks, so that VI.7.5
refers to the kindling of the ritual fire. In that vs. Agni found the sun (“beacon of the
days”), which was therefore distinct from him, and in the next vs. (VI.7.6) the backs
of heaven were measured out by the sun as an organ &ndash; the eye &ndash; of Agni Vaiśvānara
(vaiśvānarásya vímitāni cákṣasā, sā́nūni diváḥ). Only in the last vs. of that hymn,
VI.7.7, did Agni Vaiśvānara himself measure out the cosmos and take on his usual
solar aspect. The two pādas VI.7.7a (ví yó rájāṃsy ámimīta sukrátuḥ) and our VI.8.2c
(vy àntarikṣam amimīta sukrátuḥ) are almost identical, but the former represents the
resolution of the disjunction between Agni Vaiśvānara and the sun, while no such
disjunction is found in our hymn.</p>
<h3 id="vi83">VI.8.3</h3>
<p>The cosmogonic activities of Agni Vaiśvānara continue here, but I would
argue that they are instances of the daily creation of the cosmos by the light of the
sun. The propping apart of the two world halves refers to the visual separation of
earth and sky at the horizon at first light, and the rolling out of the two skins is a
similar image, of the full extent of earth and sky revealed to sight at that time.
It is not entirely clear why Agni Vaiśvānara is called an “unerring ally” (mitró
ábhutaḥ; see the identical phrase in I.94.13 and similar I.77.3 mitró ná bhūd
ádbhutasya rathī
́
ḥ). Agni is of course regularly identified as an ally (mitrá-) and is
compared to Mitra because of his role as go-between between gods and men; in this
particular case the sun’s role as the most visible of the gods and the heavenly being
most clearly engaged with human life may have elicited this description. The covert
presence of Mitra here may also play off the covert presence of Varuṇa in 2b, in the
phrase vratā́ni … vratapā́arakṣata “as protector of vratas, he guarded the vratas:
vratás are Varuṇa’s special province, although curiously Varuṇa is never called
vratapā́- in the RV.
The interpr. of pāda b is disputed because of disagreement about the sense and
formation of antarvā́vat (also found in I.40.7). Ge tr. the pāda as “er zerteilte die
dazwischenliegende Finsternis durch das Licht” (almost identically also Oberlies
Relig. I.191), presumably with the ‘between’ sense of antár nominalized with the
complex suffix -vā́-vant-. Re denies that the formation has a complex (or duplicate)
suffix but rather considers it an imitation of arvāvát ‘nearby’, despite the difference
in accent, and renders the word (in his note) as “un domaine intérieur (= invisible).”
37
His tr. of the pāda is “il a fait que les ténèbres (devinssent) par la lumière un
domaine-cachée.” So, he takes antár in the meaning ‘within’, but the further
morphological analysis is unclear. Old (ad I.40.7) also sees the ‘within’ sense of
antár here, but with a more plausible interpr. of the suffixal material — with the
whole meaning ‘inhaltsvoll’ (that is, ‘having [something] within’). He also considers
it is entirely or roughly synonymous with antárvant-. (Both of these views are also
found in AIG II.2.893, and the whole is laid out with admirable clarity by Schmidt
[B+I 102]. Both AiG and Schmidt explain -vā́-vant- as pleonastic.) The second
observation seems to me the most important clue: antárvant- is in fact only attested
in the fem. antárvatī- (III.55.5, X.91.6) in the meaning ‘pregnant’. In both I.40.7 and
our passage here the ‘pregnant’ sense is used metaphorically of non-females (kṣáya-
‘dwelling place’ in the former, támas- ‘darkness’ in the latter). (So also Schmidt;
AiG doesn’t go quite this far.) One could speculate that the pleonastic suffix is used
because a non-fem. antárvant- would seem distinctly odd, and the addition of a
second suffix attenuated this oddness. In our case, the antarvā́vat can directly modify
neut. támaḥ; in I.40.7, since kṣáya- is masc., the connection is less direct. See comm.
ad loc. In our passage this interpr. produces a striking image, of the darkness of night
swelling with light as day breaks.</p>
<h3 id="vi84">VI.8.4</h3>
<p>I have no idea what the buffaloes (mahiṣā́ḥ) are doing here or why they do
what they do in the lap of the waters. Ge (n. 4a) suggests that the buffaloes are the
gods or the old singers, but this does not actually explain anything (including why
they would be called buffaloes). Ge notes the very similar passage X.45.3 tṛtī́ye tvā
rájasi tasthivā́ṃsam, apā́
m upásthe mahiṣā́
avardhan “The buffalos strengthened you,
who were standing in the third realm, in the lap of the waters.” That passage occurs
in a hymn concerned with Agni’s triple birth, one of which is in the waters, but the
identity of the buffaloes remains unclear. In X.8.1 it is Agni himself who as buffalo
grows strong in the same place: apā́
m upásthe mahiṣó vavardha “the buffalo has
grown strong in the lap of the waters.”
The second pāda shows the connection between Agni Vaiśvānara and royal
power and the second hemistich the connection between that thematic complex and
Vivasvant, as Proferes convincingly argues (Sovereignty, pp. 28–29 and passim).
Note the phonological intertwining of #víśo … / … vivásvato # vaiśvānaró …</p>
<h3 id="vi85">VI.8.5</h3>
<p>In the first hemistich the distribution of the accusatives is at issue: vidathyàm
… rayíṃ yaśásam … návyasīm. The first, vidathyàm, must be either masc. or neut.;
yaśásam is ambiguous between masc. and fem. (though far more often masc. than
fem.); návyasīm is clearly fem. The sole noun, rayím, is generally held to be normally
masc., but occasionally fem. Although I think this statement is true, I also think that
the number of supposedly fem. occurrences can be considerably reduced, to the point
that apparently fem. examples should be viewed as aberrancies, not as normal if rare
usages. In this particular case Old (ZDMG 55.296 [=KlSch 755], not restated in
Noten) and Ge decide that rayím must be fem. here, as evidenced by návyasīm, so
that another noun must be supplied for vidathyàm to modify. Old supplies agním and
38
takes that phrase as an obj. to the part. gṛṇádbhyaḥ (without tr.), while Ge supplies
vīrám (which does indeed occur with vidathyàm in I.91.20 and VII.36.8) as an obj.
parallel to rayím: “… einen in Weisheit tüchtigen (Mann) … und Ansehen
bringenden neuen Reichtum.” Re allows everything to modify rayím: “une richesse
(émanant) des participations-rituelles, (richesse) honorable, plus nouvelle,” with his
n. on the gender mixture seemingly meant to cast obscurity rather than illumination.
In my opinion, rayím is masc. here, modified by vidathyàm and yaśásam (so also
Thieme, Unters. 48, who simply elides návyasīm), and návyasīm belong to a separate
NP, for which I supply matí- ‘thought’, which appears in the phrase matír návyasī in
the first vs. of the hymn, 1c. Note that vs. 1 also contains a form of vidátha-
‘ceremony, rite of distribution’, to which our vidathyà- must belong (pace Ge, who
seems to derive it from √vid ‘know’). In vs. 1 the poet proclaims the vidáthā of Agni
and announces that a “newer thought” is being prepared for him. In this vs. he asks
Agni to keep providing both wealth for the vidátha- and a “newer (thought).”
Although Agni does not himself compose the poem, it is a commonplace of RVic
discourse that the gods provide the inspiration for the poets’ compositions.
In the 2nd hemistich Ge and Re take téjasā with the simile (“mit dem Schärfe
(der Axt)” and “avec l’aigu (de la hache)” respectively), while I attribute the
sharpness only to Agni in the frame. Certainly their interpr. fits the word order well
(vanínaṃ ná téjasā), though it doesn’t necessarily require téjasā to be part of the
simile. On the other hand, it does require pavyéva at the beginning of the hemistich to
be dissociated from the later simile or at least considerably sidelined. In the end, I
would go for a compromise position, that téjasā should be read with both simile and
frame: “as if with a metal wheel rim, hew down the curser with your sharpness like a
tree with the sharpness (of an axe vel sim.).”
I have not separately rendered nīcā́in the phrase nīcā́ní vṛśca, which seems
simply to reinforce the ní.</p>
<h3 id="vi86">VI.8.6</h3>
<p>Both Ge and Re take ajáram with suvī́ryam (e.g., “die unbeugsame
Herrschaft, das nicht verwelkende Heldentum”), while I take it with kṣátram. The
Ge/Re interpr. is perfectly possible, and there are no grammatical or syntactic
features to allow a clear decision. My interpr. is based on the rhetorical arg. that the
two privative adjectives (ánāmi and ajáram) belong together, but I can also see that
rhetoric might also favor parallel phrases: PRIV-ADJ. X, PRIV-ADJ. Y. My other, quite
faint, consideration was that the adj. ajára- was used of the king (=Agni) in the
previous vs. (rājan … ajara) and would transfer easily from the king to his dominion
(kṣatrá-).</p>
<h3 id="vi87">VI.8.7</h3>
<p>On Ge’s proposed emendation of iṣṭe to iṣṭébhiḥ see comm. ad I.143.8, which
has the same form in a lexically and rhetorically similar passage (containing, inter
alia, pāhi and ádabdhebhiḥ). Old (ZDMG 55.296 = KlSch. 755) is adamantly
opposed to Ge’s suggestion, and there seems no good reason to emend the passage
and no obvious trigger for such a corruption.
39
It is difficult not to interpr. the -iṣ-aor. injunc. prá … tārīḥ as an impv., given
its overt coordination with rákṣā in pāda c.
VI.9 Agni Vaiśvānara
On the structure of this complex hymn and for a verse-by-verse synopsis, see
publ. intro. It has been much translated and discussed &ndash; in addition to the usual
treatments, see, e.g., Thieme, Gedichte; Renou, Hymnes spéculatifs; Wendy Doniger,
Rig Veda. Oldenberg (ZDMG 55.296–97) gives a detailed (for him) account of the
contents and pronounces it an ākhyāna, an opinion repeated in the Noten, though he
doesn’t spell out who the speakers might be verse by verse. Gonda (Vedic Literature,
99) calls it “a profound glorification of Agni as the great immortal conceived as the
inner light and placed among the mortals to guide them in the mysteries and
intricacies of the ritual.” As discussed in the publ. intro., the hymn concerns the
development of the poet’s craft and resembles IV.5, in which the poet also receives
his poetic inspiration from Agni Vaiśvānara. I do not see the poetic contest
(brahmodya) that others (starting with Geldner [Ved. Stud. II.181–82], fld by Re,
Doniger, George Thompson [“Brahmodya”]) take as the mise en scène of the hymn.
See Old’s explicit rejection of the brahmodya interpr. (ZDMG 55.297), with which I
concur. The brahmodya interpr. primarily rests on a brief phrase in vs. 2, on which
see below.</p>
<h3 id="vi91">VI.9.1</h3>
<p>The first hemistich has two nom./acc. dual expressions (áhaś ca kṛṣṇáṃ áhar
árjunaṃ ca and rájasī) and a dual verb ví vartete. The question is which of the two
dual expressions is the subject of this verb, or is the subject both or neither? The
standard interpr. (Old, Ge, Re, Doniger) is that both expressions serve as subject and
that rájasī, usually an expression referring to space, here qualifies the two day(-
halves), light and dark. However, flg. Thieme, I instead take rájasī as an accusative
expressing extent of space, preferring to keep the temporal and spatial concepts
separate. I do have to admit that an image of rolling out the dual spaces finds support
in the preceding hymn, VI.8.3c ví cármaṇīva dhiṣáṇe avartayat “He rolled out the
two Holy Places [=world-halves] like skins,” and even more so in VII.80.1
vivartáyantīm rájasī sámante “(Dawn,) unrolling the two adjoining realms.” The
object of the transitive ví vartáya- in those passages should be the subject of the
intrans. simplex verb. Nonetheless, see nearby VI.7.7 ví yó rájāṃsi ámimīta “who
measured out the dusky realms,” with rájas- as object, and the frequent use of ví to
refer to movement through space. As I see it, the image here is of the day and night
proceeding through the cosmos, spreading first light and then darkness. Since ví can
also be used for alternating movement, that notion is also probably present: “The
black day and the silvery day roll out alternately through the two dusky realms,”
referring to the regular alternation of night and day.
Re points out two minor anomalies in word placement: ca in pāda a, ná in
pāda c. The first is not immediately second in its constituent (expect *áhaś cā́rjunam,
like the first constituent áhāś ca kṛṣṇám, not áhar árjunaṃ ca). Klein (DGRV I.133)
suggests that the construction is a conflation of the expected sequence (given as
40
starred just above) and one with only an adjective in the second constituent (kṛṣṇáṃ
cā́har árjunaṃ ca, as he constructs it). This is possible but seems somewhat overcomplex. It’s worth noting that a properly placed ca would be damaging to the meter,
whether it was read undistracted (cā́rjunam), the more common option for ca + V, or
distracted (ca árjunam). I had thought that another argument for the unusual
placement might be that ca + V is generally avoided, but a quick glance at Lubotsky
turns up about 70 instances of ca + V (out of 1094 total instances of ca). I doubt that
this represents a statistically significant underrepresentation, although I ran no tests.
As for ná, it ordinarily is also positioned after the first element in the simile,
but it is highly unlikely (that is, quite impossible) that Agni is being compared to a
king being born, with the simile comprising jā́yamāno ná rā́jā, but rather Agni, even
as he is being kindled, is compared to the victorious (adult) king, with the simile just
ná rā́jā. Such “wrong” positioning is not unprecedented — other examples have been
noted in the comm. — and, as Re points out, it is “masked to the eyes” by jā́yamānaḥ,
which matches rā́jā in number, gender, and case.
VI.9.1–2: Note the echo of the last word of vs. 1, támāṃsi, in the last word of the 1st
hemistich of b, ’tamānāḥ. The latter form is the pres. part. to the 1st class pres. of √at
‘wander’, with apharesis of the initial vowel after samaré. This abhinihita sandhi,
relatively rare in the RV, is metrically guaranteed, and it may have been applied in
order to bring the participle more into phonological line with támāṃsi.</p>
<h3 id="vi92">VI.9.2</h3>
<p>The 1st person speaker, the poet in training, takes over here, with a statement
of his ignorance about his own metier. He expresses this ignorance in the metaphor
of weaving, a well-known trope for poetic composition that reaches back into IndoEuropean antiquity.
The main support for the brahmodya interpr. is the loc. samaré, which is
almost universally construed with (á)tamānāḥ in the sense “entering the contest” (vel
sim.: Ge: “wenn sie in den Wettstreit eintreten,” Re: “quand ils marchent dans
l’arène”). But this bends the sense of both words. The other occurrence of the medial
participle átamāna- (II.38.3) does not signal the type of purposeful motion implied
by those translations; there are no other middle forms in the RV, only a single active
(I.30.4), whose goal-oriented motion can be accounted for by both the voice and the
presence of a preverb. Assuming that √at is continued by younger √aṭ (see EWA, s.v.
AT), the usual gloss of the root, ‘wander’, is probably accurate. As for samará-, it is
obviously formed of the same elements (sám √ṛ lit. ‘come/move together’) as
samáraṇa-, which does usually mean ‘collision, conflict’ (cf. also the hapax denom.
samaryáti), and it has a derivative samaryá- that generally refers to the same. But
samará- itself is found only twice elsewhere, both times in the meaning ‘gathering,
confluence’ with a genitive expressing goods or spoils (VI.47.6 samaré vásūnām,
X.139.3 samaré dhánānām), a benign assemblage rather than a hostile clashing
together. Thus, “entering the contest” is at best a weakly supported interpr. of
samaré ’tamānāḥ; we are free to interpret that phrase differently and, with the
supposed rival poet-competitors removed from the passage, to concentrate on the real
41
competition &ndash; that between the poet and his father, as set out in the second hemistich
of this vs.
However, let us first consider the rest of the first half-verse. The poet
expresses his ignorance of three things: tántum … ótum … yáṃ váyanti. Most tr. try
to make tántum and ótum grammatically parallel, either by making them both nouns
(e.g., Re “Je ne connais point la lisse ni la trame …”) or both infinitives (e.g., Thieme
“Nicht verstehe ich [die Fäden des Aufzugs] zu spannen, nicht [die Fäden des
Einschlags] zu weben.”). This is understandable, since the two terms are identically
formed, with full-grade accented root and -tu- suffix. However, this morphological
identity conceals a difference in usage. tántu- behaves like a straight noun: it has
nominative forms; it occurs in the plural; it has adjectives modifying it (e.g., IX.83.2
śócantaḥ … tántavaḥ, as well as tatá- ‘stretched’ several times) and genitives
dependent on it (e.g., IX.73.9 ṛtásya tántuḥ). By contrast, outside of this hymn ótu- is
found only in the clear dative infinitives ótave (X.130.2) and ótavaí (I.164.5, where
in fact acc. pl. tántūn is construed with it). I therefore think that tántum and ótum in
this passage are non-parallel, just as the third source of ignorance, expressed in a rel.
cl., is not parallel to either of the others. In my view, having three non-parallel
objects to the verb ví jānāmi makes the bewilderment stronger: it’s not just three
different things the poet doesn’t understand, but three categories of things &ndash; which
categories of things are expressed by different grammatical categories: a noun, an
infinitive, a relative clause (without antecedent). “I do not understand the thread
(noun), nor (how) “to weave” (infinitive), nor “what they weave” (rel. cl.). Although
-tum infinitives are quite rare in the RV (5 stems, acdg. to Macdonell VG §586b, Re
GLV §371), I suggest that ótum was formed and used here, rather than the already
existing dat. inf., to provide this grammatical contrast with apparently identical
tántum.
Since, contra the standard tr., I do not believe that the subject of the verb
váyanti refers to rival poets, I must propose a different subject. Here the alternative
possibilities for átamāna- and samará-, as discussed above, provide the clues, along
with a rudimentary understanding (which is all I have) of the weaving process. With
the warp threads (tántu-) stretched lengthwise on the loom, “wandering” is a
pleasingly apt description of the way the weft threads go alternately under and over
the warp threads proceeding horizontally, and this mingling of warp and weft could
easily be characterized as “a meeting/gathering.” My only uncertainty is the precise
identity of the subjects who do the weaving (váyanti). Are they the weft threads
themselves as they wander over and under? Are they the human weavers, or their
fingers, manipulating the weft threads? Or some technological substitute like shuttles.
As MLW reminds me, that Vedic India knew such technology is clear from X.130, a
cosmogonic hymn whose operative metaphor is weaving and that contains a word
plausibly taken to be ‘shuttle’ (tásara- in vs. 2).
Of course, since the weaving in this verse is metaphorical for poetic
composition, ultimately the subjects of váyanti must underlyingly be poets — those
who do know how and what to “weave.” But my point here is that the imagery of
weaving is carried further than the standard brahmodya interpretation allows: the
42
wandering and the coming together refer to the weaving process, not to a putative
poetic competition. Moreover, with the contest interpr. banished, the underlying
poets need not be guys physically present in the next room, as it were, polishing their
verses; they can be any poets in the tradition. Which brings us to the father.
The second hemistich contains two sets of polarized terms: putrá- / pitár- ‘son’
/ ‘father’ and pará- / ávara- ‘above’ / ‘below’. (That pará- and ávara- make up a
polarized pair is clear from numerous passages in which they are contrasted [e.g.,
I.164.17, X.88.17].) The case assignment in the text, nominative for the first of each
pair, instrumental for the second, makes it clear that it is the son who is above, the
father below, although this is the counterintuitive pairing. As noted in the publ. intro.,
despite his professed ignorance of poetic craft, the young poet feels that he must not
only equal but surpass his father, to further the poetic lineage. That pará- can mean
not only ‘higher’ but also ‘further’, while ávara- means both ‘below’ and ‘nearer’,
allows the sense of “furthering” the line also to be read in the passage. The father is
close by, both to the poet and the present moment, but the poet himself must go
farther, in the future, beyond the model of his father, to speak “what is to be said”
(váktvāni); it is perhaps ironic that the only other occurrence of váktva- in the RV
outside this hymn is as a genitive pl. dependent on ‘father’: III.26.9 pitáraṃ
váktvānām “the father of what is to be said,” referring to Agni. It is a nice touch in
our vs. that because ‘father’ is in the instr., it better fits the phonological template of
‘son’ than the direct cases would: putrá … pitrā́.</p>
<h3 id="vi93">VI.9.3</h3>
<p>This vs. is responsive to vs. 2, repeating pāda a almost verbatim, while
transposing it into the 3rd ps. from the 1st and into the positive from the negative. The
2nd pāda abbreviates the 2nd hemistich of vs. 2, pulling out the all-important object
and verb (váktvāni … vadāti) that had been scattered across two pādas in vs. 2. The
2nd hemistich introduces new material — identifying the person who does know what
the poet says he doesn’t yet — while replacing the pará- / ávara- pair with the
almost identical pára- / aváḥ ‘below’ [adv.].
The first half-verse with its near identical repetition is straightforward, but,
with its repetition of “just he … he … he” (sá íd … sá … sá) as the subj. of ‘knows’
and ‘will speak’, it promises both a resolution to the poet’s anxiety of ignorance in
2ab and an answer to the question “whose son?” (kásya putráḥ) in 2cd.
But though the identity of the “he” of 3ab is surely revealed by the relative cl.
in the 2nd hemistich, beginning “who …” (yáḥ, 3c), the referent is far from clear.
There are both an apparent and apparently obvious answer and, in my opinion
anyway, a covert but enlightening answer that depends on tricky manipulation of the
words as given &ndash; which is, after all, the point of the hymn, to learn the ins and outs
of verbal weaving. The standard tr. take Agni as the subject of the whole vs.; he is
the one who know the thread and the weaving and can say the things to be said.
There is a good, obvious piece of evidence that this interpr. is correct: the subject of
the relative clause in c appears to be identified as amṛ́tasya gopā́ḥ “the herdsman of
the immortal.” This epithet was used of Agni only two hymns previously (VI.7.7); it
seems to clinch the identification. But note what precedes it: yá īṃ cíketat “who will
43
perceive him/it.” Ge (fld. by Doniger) takes īm as referring to the thread, while Re
simply ignores it. But Thieme takes amṛ́tasya gopā́ḥ as the content of the act of
perception, as a quotation: “der ihn (Gott Feuer) erkannt: ‘[Er ist] der Hüter des
Lebens,’” with īm the obj. of cíketat anticipating the revelation of Agni’s role and
power in the quote. I find Thieme’s interpr. very persuasive. The one who knows all
this is not Agni, but the poet who rightly perceives Agni, who possesses the esoteric
knowledge acquired by contemplating the ritual fire and receiving its vision.
Thieme then takes pāda d as referring to the poet-subject of c, but I think we
can go one better: d is both a description of the poet, as Thieme takes it, and a
continuation of the right perception of Agni that the poet received, the second part of
the quoted revelation “he is the herdman of the immortal.” In this latter interpr., Agni
“moves about below” (aváś cáran) as the ritual fire of mortals, but “sees above the
other one” (paró anyéna páśyan), because he (in the form of smoke) goes to heaven
bringing the oblations to the gods. By my rules of placement for anyá- (1997, Fs.
Beekes), it should be definite here (“the other,” not “another,” as in most interpr.).
Here “the other” is quite possibly the sun, which is Agni’s allo-form but also
presumably somewhat lower in heaven than the smoke carrying the oblations. In the
alternative application of this pāda, to the poet, I differ in some crucial ways from
Thieme (whose interpr. I will not present further here). The poet also “moves about
below” not only as a mortal on the earth, but also as a son, who in one sense is
“below” his father in the lineage. But he “sees above the other,” who is the father
whose skills he is trying to best. Though in this pāda both aváḥ and pára- refer to the
son, whereas in 2cd pára- referred to the son and ávara- to the father, here the
ultimate superiority of the son is triumphantly announced, whereas in 2cd this
outcome was in question. The cleverness and intricacy of this 2nd hemistich, esp.
immediately following the near verbatim repetition found in the first, is a clear
demonstration that the young poet has come into his skills and his poetic heritage.</p>
<h3 id="vi94">VI.9.4</h3>
<p>As argued in the publ. intro., this vs. is the omphalos of a well-structured
omphalos hymn, and it contains the “message” of the hymn: the revelatory vision of
Agni immediately before the eyes of the poet. This immediacy is conveyed by the
near-deictic pronoun that begins the first three pādas — ayám (a), idám (b), ayám (c)
— and also ends the first pāda (imám). The immediacy is also conveyed by the
abrupt command “look at him” (páśyatemám) at the end of the 1st pāda; since the
impv. is in the 2nd plural, it cannot be addressed to the poet alone. Instead I suggest
that it is the poet speaking, urging his priestly colleagues to behold the revelation that
has just come to him. As noted also in the publ. intro., the name Agni does not occur
in this verse. In fact, in the whole hymn agní- is found only in the first and last vss.
(1d and 7b), another reinforcement of the omphalos structure. But every phrase in
this vs. is an unmistakable description of Agni, and each could be matched by many
similar phrases in Agni hymns. Unlike many omphalos vss., this one is not enigmatic
and riddling (save for the omission of the name), but straightforward and obvious,
one might say blazingly transparent. In this way it captures the poet’s sudden burst of
enlightenment, in which he truly sees for the first time what is (and has always been)
44
in front of him. As such it can be characterized as an epiphany in the technical sense:
although the ritual fire has been there all along, it is only now that the poet sees that
the fire is really the god. This divine revelation is underscored by the two
occurrences of “immortal” (jyótir amṛ́tam b, ámartyaḥ d), taking up the poet’s initial
true perception in 3c, where he saw that Agni was “the herdsman of the immortal”
(amṛ́tasya gopā́ḥ).
dhruvá in dhruvá ā́is ambiguous. The Pp. takes it as nom. dhruváḥ, but
modern interpr. differ: Old (ZDMG 55.297 and Noten, with Gr [transl.], Hillebrandt,
Pischel) and Thieme opt rather for the loc. dhruvé, while Gr (Wö), Ge, and Re follow
the Pp. — as do I: dhruvám modifying Agni as light (jyótiḥ) in the next vs. (5a)
seems decisive. The constructions are quite parallel: the “steadfast light” of 5a was
also “set down” (níhitam), just as “steadfast (Agni)” was “set down” (níṣattaḥ) in 4c.
A loc. interpr. is not out of the question, however.
VI.9.5–7: The last three vss. of this hymn are dominated by play on the syllable ví,
which is also evident, though recessive, in the first part of the hymn. Starting with 5c
every hemistich begins with ví: 5c víśve, 6a ví, 6c ví, 7a víśve; note also ví in the
middle of 5d and 6a and beginning 6b. This sequence culminates in 7c vaiśvānaraḥ,
whose first syllable is phonologically a vṛddhi form of vi and whose first member
vaiśva- is morphologically a vṛddhi derivative of víśva-. That the two forms of víśve
in 5c and 7a are in the syntagm víśve devā́ḥ “all the gods” and the 2nd member of
vaiśvānará- is contrastively -nara- ‘man’ makes the pattern all the more pleasing.
And of course it is Agni Vaiśvānara who is the source of the poet’s revelation and
therefore the focus of the hymn. The stationing of vaiśvānaráḥ at the beginning of
the last hemistich of the hymn also forms a ring with the same form at the beginning
of the second hemistich of the 1st vs. and reinforces the omphalos structure.
VI.9.5–6: The transference of the properties and powers of Agni to our poet is
explicit in these two vss. In 5a Agni is light set down or deposited (jyótir níhitam); in
5b he is “swiftest mind” (máno jáviṣṭham). In 6b the poet comments on “this light
that has been deposited in (my) heart” (idáṃ jyótir hṛ́daya ā́hitaṃ yát; note the neardeictic idám again), and in 6c “my mind goes widely” (ví me mánaś carati).
The two vss. are also contrastive. In 5 all the gods sharing the same mind and
the same perception (sámanasaḥ sáketāḥ) converge on Agni as the single focus of
their intention or resolve (ékaṃ krátum abhí ví yanti sādhú), whereas in 6 the poet
vividly describes the dis-integration of his senses, emphasized by the repetition of ví
‘widely, apart). But rather than expressing a worrisome loss of physical and mental
control, the vs. seems rather to dramatize the exciting expansion of his sensory
horizons, the limitless potentials for thought and speech that he now experiences. His
ears flying apart (ví me kárṇā patayataḥ), his mind moving widely (ví me mánaḥ
carati) are anticipated by Agni’s mind “swiftest among those flying” (jáviṣṭham
patáyatsu), and the insistent ví in this vs. is given a positive spin by the pattern of vi-s
leading to vaiśvānará-, as discussed above.
45
In the omphalos structure this vs. is twinned with vs. 2, where the poet
worried about his lack of knowledge and skill; here his mind and body can literally
not contain the possibilities. One index to the change in his mental attitude may be
shown by the difference in mood between the tentative subjunctive vadāti in 2d and
the purposeful future vakṣyāmi in 6d. Both are in questions, but the first wonders
“whose son will (be able) to speak …?” while the latter seems only to question which
of the many possibilities he should begin with: “what shall I say?” There are only
two finite forms of the future to √vac in the RV (plus one participial form), so the
choice of this form must be marked here. The other is pravakṣyā́maḥ in I.162.1,
announcing the recital of the heroic deeds (vīryā̀ṇi) of the horse to be sacrificed and
therefore functioning exactly like the more common, likewise annunciatory prá
vocam (e.g., in the famous opening of the Indra-Vṛtra hymn I.32.1 índrasya nú
vīryā̀ṇi prá vocam). The correspondent of this future is found rather often in Old
Avestan, where 1st sg. (fra) vaxšiiā regularly performs the same function of
proclamation, as in Y 30.1, 45.1 — perhaps indicating a common IIr. employment of
this future as an introducer of formal praise. The use of this form here suggests that
our speaker is foreseeing his role as official encomiast and poet of record, not simply
casting about for something to say. It is possible that svid (kíṃ svid vakṣyāmi)
contributes to this sense, but I don’t have a good sense of the function of this particle
in the RV.</p>
<h3 id="vi97">VI.9.7</h3>
<p>The final vs. of the hymn forms the outer frame of the omphalos structure
with vs. 1. We have already noted the responsion of hemistich-initial vaiśvānaráḥ in
1c and 7c and the only two occurrences of the stem agní- in 1d and 7b. Another
important verbal repetition is támas-, the last word of vs. 1, found in 7b in the phrase
támasi tasthivā́ṃsam “(Agni,) standing in darkness.” The sentence in which this is
found seems an odd way to end a hymn: “all the gods, in fear (bhiyānā́ḥ), offered
homage (anamasyan) to you, while you were standing in darkness.” Why are the
gods afraid and what time period does the augmented imperfect refer to? And why is
this somewhat downbeat statement the real end of the hymn (the last hemistich being
a generic request for aid)? I don’t have certain answers to these questions, but I think
the omphalos structure gives us some guidance. This final vs. seems not simply to
circle round to the 1st vs., but in fact to take us to a time (right) before the events
depicted in the first vs. In vs. 1 Agni overcame the darkness with his light (1d); here
he is still in darkness, before he has become equipped with light, before he has been
kindled, in fact. The gods are afraid because they fear he won’t light up &ndash; and,
reading between the lines, he will only light up if the human ritualists kindle him.
Even the gods are dependent on our dawn sacrifice, and, reading further between
those lines, our newly minted poet will have a crucial role in making that sacrifice
succeed.
The last hemistich has a curious etymological figure, repeated for emphasis:
avatūtáye (i.e., avatu ūtáye) “let him help for help.”</p>
<h2 id="vi10-agni">VI.10 Agni</h2>
<p>46</p>
<h3 id="vi101">VI.10.1</h3>
<p>In the lexeme puró √dhā, puráḥ serves as a pseudo-preverb; the phrase
shows extreme distraction (pseudo-tmesis) here, with puráḥ initial in the 1st
hemistich and dadhidhvam final in that hemistich. The phrase is then revitalized with
puráḥ opening pāda c, thus directly adjacent to its verb though across a hemistich
boundary. That the opening words of pāda c, purá ukthébhiḥ belong to the clause in
the first hemistich is further shown by the abrupt clause boundary and change of
subject in the middle of c, clearly signalled by a typical clause-initial sequence of
PRN + Wackernagel-position particles, sá hí naḥ.
Pāda b has two extra syllables. The meter could be easily fixed by deleting
agním with no ill effects to sense or metrical structure. This is an old idea (see Old’s
reff., ZDMG 55.298), but though harmless, it may be better to accept the text as
given (see Old, Noten ad loc.).
On suvṛktí- as a secondary bahuvrīhi, meaning ‘possessing/receiving (hymns)
that possess a good twist’, see comm. ad II.4.1. This interpr. as a masc. adj. is
imposed by the otherwise unbroken string of acc. sg. masculines: mandráṃ divyáṃ
suvṛktím … agním. In the comm. ad II.4.1 I suggest that it can also have the primary
bahuvrīhi meaning ‘having a good twist’, referring to Agni’s curls of smoke and
flame. This would also be possible as an alternative or secondary reading here.
I take adhvaré as part of the loc. absol. prayatí yajñé, contra Ge. (Re seems to
ignore the second loc.) Nothing much rides on either choice.</p>
<h3 id="vi102">VI.10.2</h3>
<p>As was discussed in the publ. intro., this hymn traffics in disappointed
expectations and truncated syntax, and this vs. displays both in extreme form. The vs.
begins tám u “him/it [acc. sg.] PARTICLE.” Given that the dedicand of the hymn is
Agni and vs. 1 contained a long acc. phrase referring to Agni (though that vs. ended
with Agni as nom. subj.), we might expect that tám = Agni, and our expectations
would be supported by a little formula found in various places in the RV (see Klein,
Particle u, 67–68):
VIII.95.6 tám u ṣṭavāma yáḥ “let us praise him who …”
VIII.96.6 tám u ṣṭuhi yáḥ “praise him who …”
V.42.1 tám u ṣṭuhi yáḥ (ditto)
I.173.5 tám u ṣṭuhi &hellip; yáḥ (ditto)
as well as variations on it. In our vs., immediately following u there is a long
interruption, consisting mostly of vocatives addressed to Agni (dyumaḥ purvaṇīka
hotar, ágne), leaving the tám in syntactic suspension. But when we finally reach the
end of the hemistich, we encounter a nominative participle idhānáḥ ‘being kindled’,
which can only refer to Agni. This leaves the initial tám doubly unmoored: it can’t
refer to Agni, as we’d thought, and it can’t be construed with idhānáḥ, which is
intransitive and doesn’t take accusatives.
The resolution of one of these problems comes at the beginning of the second
hemistich, which opens with the acc. stómam, which must be the referent of tám.
This is a pleasing twist on the formula just noted: the root √stu is preserved, but as a
coreferential nominal, not as the verb governing the tám. There is also an element of
47
“vertical mantra,” since the elements of the NP táṃ stómam are positioned
“vertically” in identical metrical slots.
There is no resolution of the other problem, however: what governs this acc.
phrase. stómam is immediately followed by the rel. prn. yám introducing a dependent
clause (and reminding us of the yáḥ in the quoted formula). There is no overt
governing verb in the main clause; all we know is that it should have Agni as subject,
given the nom. part. idhānáḥ. Ge, flg. Sāy. and fld. by Re (in his tr., which reflects
neither of his suggestions in the n.), supplies the impv. “hear.” This is of course
nothing wrong with the sense of this (“[hear] this praise which …”), but there is also
nothing in context to support it. I have supplied “take to yourself,” assuming a medial
form of √dhā. There are two pieces of supporting evidence for this. It could be
generated (somewhat trickily) from dadhidhvam, the impv. in the previous verse.
And — rather stronger evidence — a similar expression is found overtly in vs. 6:
“you [=Agni] have taken to yourself the well-twisted (hymn)” (dadhiṣe suvṛktím),
with a medial form of √dhā with Agni as subject and a praise as object. Old’s “nimm
… an” (both ZDMG 55.299 and Noten) coincides with my interpr., but he does not,
as far as I can see, provide a motivation for it.
What to do with the rest of the first hemistich, namely agníbhir mánuṣaḥ, is
another problem. With Ge I take mánuṣaḥ as dependent on hotar, despite the distance
between them and the fact that mánuṣaḥ is accented in a voc. phrase (easily
accounted for by the distance). The phrase mánuṣo hótar- is common in the RV (e.g.,
I.180.9, II.18.2, IV.6.11, V.5.7). The instr. agníbhiḥ must be construed with the part.
idhānáḥ, as witnessed by the identical expression in the next two hymns (VI.11.6b,
12.6b), but whether it is an instr. of accompaniment as I take it (“along with the
[other] fires”), as apparently also Ge, or a true instrument (e.g., Re “allumé par les
feux…”) isn’t certain — though I’m not sure what Re’s “being kindled by the fires”
would mean.
The relative cl. of pāda c is in no better shape than the main clause of ab. It
too lacks a verb. Though there is a finite verb in pāda d, pavante, it not only lacks an
accent and therefore can’t be part of the rel. cl., but it is also intrans. and cannot take
yám as object. Moreover, both asmai and mamáteva present difficulties of their own.
Let us begin with asmai. It surely refers to the recipient of the praise, which just as
surely must be Agni. But Agni is addressed in the extensive vocative phrase in ab,
and so he must be present both as 2nd ps. addressee and 3rd ps. recipient in the same
sentence. Switch of person even within a syntactic construction is of course not
unusual. I have no particular answer to this example of it beyond suggesting that 1)
the poet may have lost a bit of track of his referents in this syntactically truncated
construction, and 2) asmai may also be serving as a near deictic, pointing to “this
(Agni) here.” It is barely possible, but I think highly unlikely, that asmai refers to
another ritual participant, despite Ludwig’s interpr. (see Ge n. 2c) “für diesen
Opferer.”
mamáteva is presumably to be analyzed, with the Pp., as mamátā iva; the
resulting mamátā is a hapax. It is generally taken as a PN (“like Mamatā”), an interpr.
whose strongest support is the vṛddhi deriv. māmateyá-, usually a metronymic of
48
Dīrghatamas (I.147.3, 152.6, 158.6, particularly clear in the last passage), which
presupposes an underlying PN of this shape. Both the -eyá- suffix of māmateyá- and
the name Mamatā itself suggest that the person may be female. However, there is
some direct evidence that a masc. *mamáta- is found in the Bharadvāja lineage. Cf.</p>
<h3 id="vi5015">VI.50.15</h3>
<p>evā́
nápāto máma tásya dhībhír / bharádvājā abhí arcanti arkaíḥ “In just
this way the Bharadvājas, the descendants of me, this Mamata, chant with their
insightful thoughts, with their chants,” where máma tásya is probably a play on the
PN. For disc. see Old, ZDMG 42.211–12 = KlSch 580–81, though I do not think the
text needs emending. However, our mamátā is also most probably a pun, on a -tāabstract built to the gen. sg. of the 1st ps. pronoun; such a stem is attested Epic+ in the
sense ‘Selbstsucht, Eigennutz’. In this reading it could be an instr. sg. of the -tā- stem,
‘with/in my me-ness,’ in addition to being a nom. ‘like Mamatā’. On these questions
see now Mayr, PN 2.1.393. Old (ZDMG 55.298–99) explored the possibility of
taking mamátā (or -ta) as the missing verb of the rel. cl., as did I, but both of us came
up short.
It is therefore likely that another verb has to be supplied. Contextually, ‘sing,
speak, chant’ vel sim., is likely, and both Ge and Re go in that direction, as do I.
Specifically I supply a form of √ṛc ‘chant’, which takes śūṣám as obj. on a number of
occasions (I.9.10, X.96.2, 133.1); see also VI.50.15 cited just above with the locution
abhí arcanti arkaíḥ. All three of us assume that the verb is 1st sg, although there is
less support for that assumption, since there are no other 1st persons, sg. or pl., in the
hymn. The pun “in my me-ness” that I see in mamáteva would provide some support
for my “I,” but neither Ge nor Re so interprets mamáteva.</p>
<h3 id="vi103">VI.10.3</h3>
<p>This vs. also appears to be deliberately misleading, though less so than vs. 2.
It begins pīpā́ya sá “he becomes swollen.” Although √pī ‘swell’ is not a particularly
Agnaic verb, it still could be applicable to the ritual fire, and the audience might
expect an unidentified subject to be the deity of the hymn. But the second pāda, with
dat. agnáye and nom. vípraḥ, contravenes our expectations: it is the poet who
becomes swollen, as a result of his successful service to Agni.
I would emend the tr. of pāda a: śrávasā should be rendered ‘with fame’, not
‘with praise’.</p>
<h3 id="vi105">VI.10.5</h3>
<p>The usual truncation of instr. pl. ūtíbhiḥ (appropriate to final position in
Jagatī and in dimeter meters) to sg. ūtī́in final position of a Triṣṭubh pāda. Cf., e.g.,
nṛ́tamābhir ūtī́# in VI.19.10 versus, e.g., V.40.3 (etc.) citrā́bhir ūtíbhiḥ#. Our own
hymn contains an ex. of the full instr. pl. phrase in 3c #citrā́bhiḥ … ūtíbhiḥ …#. I
consider such truncations to be synchronically generated, providing no evidence for
any deep historical practice.
The bahuvrīhi puruvā́ja- is a hapax and may be a play on the poetic lineage
bharádvāja-, which name appears in 6c.</p>
<h3 id="vi106">VI.10.6</h3>
<p>Another slightly off expression: with monotonous regularity throughout the
RV Agni is described as ‘sitting’ or ‘sitting down” or “made to sit (down)’. Although
49
‘sit’ in these locutions is always expressed by the root √sad, it still seems odd to
characterize the human ritualist as ‘sitting’ (āsānáḥ, using the regularized participle
to √ās, not āsīná-), in a context where we might expect the referent to be Agni.
The expression dadhiṣe suvṛktím “repairs” both vs. 1 and vs. 2. In 1a we had
the adj. suvṛktím, which had to be a masc. referring to Agni and therefore a
secondary bahuvrīhi. Here suvṛktí- has its usual meaning of ‘well-twisted (hymn)’
and is presumably fem. As for dadhiṣe, recall that I suggest supplying a medial form
of √dhā to govern stómam in 2. Here we have the full VP.</p>
<h3 id="vi107">VI.10.7</h3>
<p>The accent on inuhí can easily be explained as contrastive to the
immediately following verb vardháya.</p>
<h2 id="vi11-agni">VI.11 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="vi111">VI.11.1</h3>
<p>Although the vs. seems superficially straightforward, it presents a number
of small difficulties. We might start with the meter of pāda c: in order to reach 11
syllables, something has to be distracted. HvN suggest nā́satiyā, but this produces a
bad cadence: – ⏑ ⏑ ×. Oldenberg (ZDMG 55.300 and Noten) instead suggests
distracting the initial preverb ā́, which produces an even worse cadence (-ṇā nā́satyā
– – – ×). And the third possibility, náasatyā, produces a third type of bad cadence
(⏑⏑ – ×). Only if we could read the first vowel of nā́satyā as distracted – ⏑ can we
fix the cadence, but there is no real license for this.
The first morphological problem is bā́dhaḥ in pāda b. Gr takes it as the acc. pl.
of a root noun ‘Treiber, Förderer’, but it is hard to fit this into the passage
semantically. Schindler (Rt. nouns) finds the passage unclear and does not commit to
a root noun interpr., much less a case form. Scar (346–47) takes it as a root noun, but
in the abl. sg. (“aus dem Drängen heraus”), in which he calls a “hoffnungslos obskur”
passage &ndash; a characterization that, given the super-abundance of hopelessly obscure
parts of the RV, seems rather overdramatic for this minor conundrum. With Old
(ZDMG 55.300), Ge, and Re &ndash; and pace Scar (346–47) &ndash; I take bā́dhaḥ as an
adverbially used neut. s-stem, like (and perhaps truncated from) sabā́dhaḥ, also an
adverbially nom.-acc. s-stem, which, however, Scar also thinks is an old abl. sg. of
the root noun. However, even if Scar should be right, the interpr. of bā́dhaḥ as abl. sg.
of a root noun could be adapted to the adverbial interpr. with one further step (as he
recognizes): ‘out of urgency’ à ‘urgently’.
The next question is the application of the simile marútāṃ ná práyukti and the
morphological identity of the last word. To start with the latter, with most interpr. I
take it as an instr. *-tī shortened in pause (or, with a more modern descrip., with loss
of its final laryngeal in pause [and here before a vowel beginning the next
hemistich]). But what does the hitching up of the Maruts have to do with Agni’s
sacrificial performance? My assumption is that the simile is limited to qualifying the
adverbial bā́dhaḥ ‘pressingly, urgently’. Since everything the Maruts do is
precipitous, no doubt the yoking up of their horses is performed with the same
urgency, to get on the road as soon as possible. Both Ge and Re push prá √yuj
50
further than I think it should go &ndash; to ‘impulsion, instigation’ (“wie auf Betreiben der
Marut” and “à l’instigation des Marut” respectively), a sense that seems distant from
the ‘yoke, hitch up’ sense of √yuj. I also don’t see that the Maruts would be the ones
to set Agni’s sacrificing in motion; they are not even associated with the dawn
sacrifice and don’t have much to do with Agni. My “at the hitching up” reads as if it
were a locative. Though that tr. was made for English parsing reasons, I might
slightly alter it to “with the hitching up.”
In pāda d both Ge and Re (flg. Gr’s interpr.) take hotrā́ya as simply referring
to the sacrifice (e.g., “zu unserem Opfer”), but hotrá- is elsewhere not the sacrifice,
but the office of Hotar or the performance of the Hotar’s duties. My tr. (“turn
[various gods] to the Hotar-work”) makes it seem that those gods will perform that
office, but, since Agni is the Hotar par excellence (see, e.g., pāda a, also 2a, 6a), it
must rather be that Agni is urged to cause the gods to turn towards his own
performance of his duties. It might be clearer if the tr. read “toward my Hotar-work.”</p>
<h3 id="vi112-1">VI.11.2</h3>
<p>The disposition of the elements in pāda b is not entirely clear. In the publ. tr.
I construe antár with mártyeṣu “(god) among men/mortals” and consider vidáthā an
acc. of extent of time/occasion “through the rites.” Ge agrees with the first, but
supplies a verb to govern vidáthā: sā́dhan “der … die Opfer (zustande bringt),” on
the basis of two passages containing this phrase (III.1.18, IV.16.3 vidáthāni sā́dhan).
I did not believe then that these two passages constituted sufficient formulaic support
for supplying a form of √sādh, but now I’m more sympathetic to Ge’s view. But
there are also other possibilities. In Agni passages antár is often in a lexeme with √i
or √car: ‘go between’ &ndash; usually between heaven and earth or men and gods. Flg. Old
and Re, such a lexeme, with the verb of motion supplied, could be construed with
vidáthā: e.g., Re “(te mouvant) entre les participations-cultuelles.” And, if we take
vidátha- in its occasional meaning of ‘(cosmic) divisions’, we can follow Thieme
(Unters. 43) in his interpr. “zwischen den Verteilungen (Himmel, Luftraum, Erde) ist
er, der Himmlische unter den Sterblichen.” Any of these is, in my opinion, possible,
but I will stick with the publ. tr., as involving the least amount of extra manipulation.
Since váhnir āsā́is a fairly common locution (see passages assembled by Ge
ad I.76.4), instr. āsā́‘with the mouth’ is not parallel to instr. juhvā̀‘with the tongue’,
despite grammatical and semantic similarity.</p>
<h3 id="vi113">VI.11.3</h3>
<p>There are several metrical problems in this vs. Pāda c has the caesura after
3; there seems no way to remedy this, and the rest of the meter is fine. Pāda a is
rather more interesting: the Saṃhitā text as given yields 10 syllables; there are two
possible distractions: dhán(i)yā (HvN’s choice) and t(u)vé, but both produce the same
bad cadence (⏑ – – ×). As Old points out (ZDMG 55.300 and Noten), if we distract
neither of these choices, the vs. reads fine until the last word, with an opening of five
and dhiṣáṇā taking post-caesura position. (It is worth noting that dhiṣáṇā- is almost
always immediately post-caesura, whether after an opening of 4 or of 5.) All that’s
wanting to make a fine Triṣṭubh line is a single light syllable preceding váṣṭi.
Although I would not presume to supply such a syllable (nor does Old), it does seem
51
preferable to allow for a rest here with syncopation, rather than to choose one of the
two possible distractions that yield a bad cadence.
The syntax and exact sense of the first hemistich are somewhat unclear. Ge
and Re take the pādas together, with dhiṣáṇā as subj. both of váṣṭi and of the infin.
yájadhyai (approx. “the Holy Place wishes to sacrifice in you …”). I have two
objections to this interpr.: 1) as Old (ZDMG 55.300) points out (sim. Re; see below),
it is Agni who should be doing the sacrificing (though I.109.4, where dhiṣánā presses
soma willingly [uśatī́], renders this objection less forceful); 2) the prá beginning pāda
b suggests that there’s an intermediate verb form between váṣṭi and the infinitive or
at least that there’s a subclausal break at the pāda boundary. Re also notices the 2nd
problem indirectly, suggesting in his n. an alternative tr. “elle veut (ceci): qu’(Agni)
sacrifie en avant” (with the prá presumably represented by “en avant”). My publ. tr.
reflects such an intermediate verb form, from a supplied form of √dhā, with a form
of ‘you’ also to be supplied — with the sense “to (put) (you) forward to sacrifice …”
For √dhā + yájadhyai see nearby VI.15.15 ní tvā dadhīta ródasī yájadhyai “One
should set you [=Agni] down, to sacrifice to the two world-halves.” The locution
dhiṣáṇā √dhā is also quite common, aided by real or pseudo-etymological
association; cf. III.31.13 &hellip; dhiṣánā &hellip; dhā́t; III.56.6 dhiṣaṇe &hellip; dhāḥ, IV.34.1 &hellip;
dhiṣáṇā &hellip; ádhāt; VI.19.2 &hellip; dhiṣáṇā &hellip; dhāt; VII.90.3 &hellip; dhiṣáṇā dhāti. However, I
am now no longer sure that my objections to the standard tr. are strong enough to
merit the additional complexity of my publ. interpr., and I am also disturbed by
having to interpr. loc. tvé as “in regard to you.” The next hymn contains a passage
that strongly encourages construing tvé here with yájadhyai “to sacrifice in you”:</p>
<h3 id="vi122">VI.12.2</h3>
<p>ā́yásmin tvé … yákṣat. I would now alter the tr. here to “For even the
wealthy Holy Place longs to sacrifice in you to the gods, to their races, for the singer”
&ndash; though I am still bothered by the prá.
Another problem in this syntagm is devā́ñ jánma. Old (explicitly, ZDMG
55.300) and Ge (in tr.) take devā́n as a gen. pl., a form that could either represent the
survival of a very archaic PIE gen. in *-ōm or the truncation of the standard form
devā́nām. I do not think this nec., subscribing to Re’s assertion (in n.) “devā́ñ jánma
ne comporte pas de désinence abrégée our archaïque, mais signifie «la génération (, à
savoir) les dieux»,” with devā́n and jánma as parallel acc.
In the second hemistich the referent of the subj., vépiṣṭho áṅgirasām … vípraḥ
is in question. Ge, flg. Sāy., suggests the current poet, and the presence of the singer
in b (gṛṇaté) might support this view. However, his superlative status among the
Aṅgirases makes it more likely that it is Agni. Cf. the similar expression in I.127.1
jyéṣṭham ángirasāṃ vipra “(We call upon you), o inspired poet, as the oldest/most
important of the Aṅgirases,” as well as the fairly frequent use of áṅgirastama-
‘first/best of the Aṅgirases’ for Agni (I.31.2, 75.2; VIII.23.10, 43.18, 44.8). If Agni is
the referent, there has been a switch from 2nd ps. reference (tvé in pāda a) to 3rd ps.
reference here, but this is hardly novel. See the next vs. (5).
As disc. ad VI.3.6, I interpr. rebhá- not as ‘singer’, but as ‘hoarse/huskyvoiced (singer)’, sometimes used of Agni, whose crackling is likened to singing. He
52
is so identified nearby in VI.3.6, and the use of this adj. here is another piece of
evidence that Agni is the referent of the subject in this hemistich.
In d chandáḥ is taken by Gr as the sole example of suffix-accented thematic
chandá- (not only in the RV but, acdg. to Whit, Rts., anywhere), beside chánda-. Gr
glosses our form ‘singend, preisend’ and chánda- as ‘glänzend, strahlend’; Ge, by
contrast, takes it as an s-stem and dismisses the accent: “chandáḥ doch wohl für
chándaḥ.” Pointing to the suggestive juxtaposition mádhu chandáḥ here, a near exact
match for the PN madhuchandaḥ, to whom the first ten hymns in the RV are ascribed
(though the name doesn’t appear in the RV text), he tr. “seine süsse Weise.” Re
follows suit (“le doux chant”), with the somewhat cryptic note “chandáḥ «qui
charme», comme chándaḥ.” (Curiously, Old doesn’t comment.) Although I would
like to be able to follow their interpr., with chandáḥ an anomalously accented neut. sstem, rather than an -á-stem with Gr, I do not see any way to get the suffix accent
redactionally or grammatically. My interpr. again introduces complications, but in
this case I think they are necessary to avoid positing arbitrary accent shifts. I would
suggest that the form is an s-stem, derivationally related to neut. chándas- ‘rhythm,
meter,’ showing the usual rightward accent shift of adjectival possessive derivatives
to neut. s-stems &ndash; hence ‘having rhythm’. I wish that the form in the text were
chandā́s (chandā́in sandhi), describing Agni the poet, but it is not. I therefore think it
is either a neut. used adverbially (“rhythmically” as in the publ. tr.) or that it qualifies
mádhu “rhythmic honey,” of the song.</p>
<h3 id="vi114">VI.11.4</h3>
<p>On svápāka- see comm. ad IV.3.2.
Note the switch from 3rd ps. reference (pāda a) to 2nd ps. (b). The 2nd ps.
reference continues by default through the rest of the vs., though the publ. tr. appears
to switch back to 3rd ps.: (“(anoint) him …”) for Engl. convenience.</p>
<h3 id="vi115">VI.11.5</h3>
<p>Old (ZDMG 55.301), fld. by Ge and Re, interprets vṛñjé as a t-less 3rd sg.
passive, rather than as the 1st sg. it appears to be. I do not see the necessity for this.
The same VP is found in I.116.1 (… bárhir iva prá vṛñje), where the 1st ps. interpr. is
reinforced by the flg. pāda containing the 1st sg. act. iyarmi. Further, in the almost
identical pāda VII.2.4 prá vrñjate námas ̥ ā barhír agnaú, the med. 3rd pl. vṛñjate must
be transitive with sg. bárhiḥ as obj. The best support (see Old) for a pass. interpr. is
that then all 4 pādas in this vs. would begin with a passive (b: áyāmi, c ámyakṣi, d
áśrāyi), but in that case we might expect a form more parallel to the other three.
Although √vṛj has no passive aorist attested, there are no morphological or
phonological barriers to building *ávarji (cf. the very common ásarji to √sṛj
‘discharge’). I confess I do not understand the sequence of tense, with pres. vṛñjé in
the yád clause, followed by 3 main clause augmented aorists, but taking vṛñjé as a
passive does not solve this problem.
I do not understand the semantic difference between sádman- and sádana-, if
there is one.
53</p>
<h3 id="vi116">VI.11.6</h3>
<p>As noted above, ad VI.10.2, the phrase agníbhir idhānáḥ is found both there
and in the next hymn, VI.12.6. It therefore seems unlikely that devébhiḥ should be
construed in this collocation, despite its apparent parallelism, and, with Ge and Re, I
take it as an instr. of accomp. with daśasyā́.
My interpr. of the simile in the 2nd hemistich differs from the standard. Ge
and Re assume that the comparandum for vṛjánaṃ ná is áṃhaḥ. Given the adjacency
of the two expressions, this is reasonable. Ge’s version, however, relies on a
somewhat unlikely interpr. (insofar as we understand this root) of áti √sras as
‘abstreifen’ (strip off): “… möchten wir die Not wie einen Gürtel abstreifen,” and the
notion of “stripping off” áṃhas- seems odd. Re’s “puissions nous … glisser hors du
défile-étroit comme (hors de) l’encerclement (ennemi)” does better with the verb, but
requires vṛjána- to have a particular negative sense not elsewhere met with (pace his
citation of X.27.5). In the publ. tr. I take the simile with rāyáḥ .. vāvasānā́ḥ “clothing
ourselves in riches,” comparing the wealth we wear with a girthband. For a very
similar expression, cf. I.173.6 sáṃ vivya índro vrjána ̥ ṃ ná bhū́
mā “Indra has
enwrapped himself in earth, like a circlet,” with the same simile. Although the
distance between rāyáḥ and the simile might speak against this interpr., it does work
better semantically, and the parallel passage provides strong support. It does give me
pause, however, that MLW is not convinced and thinks vṛjánaṃ ná must be
construed with áṃhaḥ.</p>
<h2 id="vi12-agni">VI.12 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="vi121">VI.12.1</h3>
<p>The ‘goad’ (todá-) found in VI.6.6 reappears here, as well as in vs. 3. Thus,
3 of the 5 occurrences of this word in the RV are found in this Agni cycle. In VI.6.6 I
argue that the referent of the “great goad” is the sun (see comm. ad loc., sim. I.150.1).
Old (ZDMG 55.301, also Noten) thinks the sun is the referent in our passage as well,
and, further, he construes the gen. tódasya in pāda b with śocíṣā tatāna in pāda d, on
the basis of VI.6.6 bhānúnā … todásya … tatantha. Although the parallel is
suggestive, the distance between the genitive and its supposed governing instr. in our
passage seems too far, esp. since the 2nd hemistich begins ayám sá “here is he” or
“this one here,” a sequence that seems to open a new (though co-referential) clause.
Moreover, in vs. 3 todá- seems to refer to or be compared to Agni himself, and so the
internal evidence of the hymn favors a connection of the goad with Agni, not directly
with the sun. I therefore follow Ge in taking todásya as dependent on rā́ṭ, which also
governs barhíṣaḥ. It may be that rā́ṭ … todásya “ruler of the goad” is a phrase like
sūnúḥ sáhasaḥ “son of strength” (see 1c), where “son of X” is tantamount to X. In
the same way “ruler of the goad” may be the equivalent of “the goad” itself. Both the
sun (“the great goad”) and Agni are goads because with their appearance at dawn
they set the world in motion. Since Agni is often taken as an earthly form of the sun,
sharing the same third party identity would not be surprising, with Agni being the
lesser of the two by nature.
For Agni as “ruler of the ritual grass,” see VIII.13.4=15.5 &hellip; asyá barhíṣo ví
rājasi, though the subject there is Indra.
54
I take yájadhyai as a predicated infinitive (sim. Ge, Re, Keydana [Inf., 171]).
The VP ródasī √yaj is found elsewhere in this cycle: 11.4 yájasva ródasī, VI.15.15 ní
tvā dadhīta ródasī yájadhyai, with the same infinitive.</p>
<h3 id="vi122-1">VI.12.2</h3>
<p>On svápāka- ‘very clever’, also VI.11.4, see comm. ad IV.3.2. As noted
there the Pp. analyses this sequence as sú ápāka-, though Ge and Re take it as a cmpd
‘having a lovely backside’. Kü (214), however, follows the Pp. analysis (also fld. by
Gr), and tr. “von Ferne kommend” (as Gr does). I do not see how a derivation from
ápā(ñ)c- ‘facing/turned backward’ could yield such a sense, esp. in a non-ablatival
formation, and, furthermore, Agni, the most present of gods, should not be “coming
from afar.” Keydana’s “der du entfernt bist” lacks the ablatival element but still runs
afoul of the other problems just noted.
‘Heaven’ (dyaúḥ) is the performer of the sacrifice in Agni; the qualification
sarvátātā-iva “as if in its entirety, in its entirety as it were” is explained, reasonably,
by Ge as meaning the gods collectively, with dyaúḥ ‘heaven’ equivalent to “die
Götterwelt.” Re follows this interpr., suggesting that sarvátātā is a variant of
devátātā. For all the gods performing such sacrifice, see, e.g., X.88.7 adduced by Ge.
In tr. yajatra as ‘the means of sacrifice’ I am taking the -tra- instrument suffix
seriously: Agni as the receptacle and recipient of the oblations is indeed the means to
sacrifice.
In the publ. tr. the phrase introduced by the em-dash “— you the very clever
…” contains only vocatives, though for ease of English they do not read as vocc.
jáṃhas- is found independently only here, but also appears in the bahuvrīhis
kṛṣṇá-jaṃhas- (I.141.7) and raghupátma-jaṃhas- (in nearby VI.3.5). Though
jáṃhas- has no direct cognates and at best a root connection to IE *ǵhengh ‘go’
(EWA s.v.), the cmpds occur in contexts that limit the semantic realm to birds (to
which Agni is compared in both cases, as also here) and that point to a bird body part,
pace Gr’s ‘Weg, Gang, Bahn’ &ndash; wings, wing-feathers, or plumage. The question is
what the point of comparison between the bird’s jáṃhas- and three-seated
(triṣadhástha-) Agni is, if in fact the simile is meant to further characterize that
descriptor. Ge suggests that a bird alighting from flight appears to settle on his two
wings and his tail-feathers (though MLW points out to me that, observationally, a
bird appears to settle not on its two wings, but its two legs). MLW then suggests that
“maybe jáṃhas- means originally ‘stride’ and then the ‘striding parts/ locomoting
parts’ and finally ‘the bottom parts'” which in a bird may be three. Re, by contrast,
takes the simile separate from triṣadhástha- and also interprets jáṃhas- as ‘enjambée’
(stride), though, as he explicitly admits, this involves “renouncing” the meaning
‘plumage’ that he ascribes to the same word in nearby VI.3.5, because “on obtient un
sens plus facile” (a very dangerous principle to apply to RVic lexicography!).
With most, I take yájadhyai again as a predicated inf. “(you are) to sacrifice,”
as in vs. 1. Kü (214) curiously interprets it as passive (“… sind die Opfergaben … zu
opfern”), though, as Keydana (174 n. 171) points out, the nom. triṣadhásthaḥ is then
left hanging.
55</p>
<h3 id="vi123">VI.12.3</h3>
<p>The rel. cl. that begins this vs. cannot span the hemistich, since the verb that
ends b, adyaut, is unaccented. There is the further problem, long noted (see Old
ZDMG 55.302), that the apparently easy application of the initial adj. téjiṣṭhā to the
next noun aratíḥ is problematic, because aratí- is masc. (though both Thieme [Unters.
29] and Re are willing to allow a fem. here, and Old toys with this notion). In my
view the rel. cl. consists only of the first two words, téjiṣṭhā yásya, with yásya of
course referring to Agni. The rest of the hemistich is couched in the nominative, with
descriptors most naturally applicable to Agni (like aratí-, which generally has Agni
as its referent), and so a syntactic shift must happen between the yásya and the
following nominatives.
Therefore, a noun must be supplied with téjiṣṭhā in the rel. cl., as Old already
suggested (ZDMG 55.302 n. 1). His candidates are ‘Glut’ or (in pl.) ‘Flammen’; Ge
follows the former suggestion, supplying tapanī́as in II.23.14. In contrast I suggest
‘course’. As we’ve seen, the Agni cycle of VI is tightly knit, and in VI.3.4 (a hymn
with another connection to this one, disc. ad vs. 2) we find tigmáṃ cid éma … yásya
“whose course is sharp …” Of course, éman- is a neut. and cannot be supplied with
fem. téjiṣṭhā, but cf. I.53.8 téjiṣṭhayā … vartanī́; vartaní- generally means ‘course,
track’, though in that particular passage I take it as ‘(wheel)edge’. In any case that
fem. would fit here nicely and match the “sharp course” of VI.3.4.
Note that both (-)rā́ṭ and todá- return from vs. 1. As discussed ad vs. 1, todánow seems to apply directly to Agni. I take this word as part of the simile (so also Ge,
Re), despite the right displacement of the simile particle, todó ádhvan ná, for which I
have no explanation.
Hemistich-final adyaut echoes dyaúḥ at the end of 2b.
In c the first question is the meaning and root affiliation of the hapax dravitā́.
Older interpr. ascribe it to √dru ‘run’: Gr ‘Renner’, apparently (with some
attenuation) Ge ‘Ausreisser’, while Re renders it as ‘fondeur’ (smelter), with,
presumably, a developed sense of √dru. However, the seṭ character of the agent noun
makes this problematic, and Hoffmann (MSS 10 [1957] 70 = Aufs. 420)
convincingly connects it with his seṭ root √drū ‘cut, reap’ &ndash; an ascription that has
been followed essentially by everyone since (e.g., EWA s.v. DRAVI
, Gotō 1st Kl., 138–
39, Tichy Nom.Ag., 35, 285, Keydana Inf., 194 n. 18). The adj. characterizing this
agent noun, adroghá-, is unexpected. It ordinarily means ‘undeceptive’ and qualifies
speech (as in the bahuvrīhi ádrogha-vāc-), but “undeceptive reaper” is puzzling. I
pushed the adjective further than it should probably go, to ‘undisguised’, which, in
conjunction with tmán ‘in person’, may express that Agni’s role in cutting down
plants is plainly evident to all. But the locution still seems awkward. Tichy’s
‘zuverlässig’ (trustworthy, reliable) mitigates some of this awkwardness and does not
stray too far from the sense of the adj.; I would be inclined to emend my tr. to
‘trustworthy’.
In d avartrá- is likewise a hapax. It appears to be a bahuvrīhi built to vártra-
(AV+) ‘dam, dike’; see Debr’s Nachtr. to AiG II.1 (p. 58).
56</p>
<h3 id="vi124">VI.12.4</h3>
<p>The first hemistich is partly assembled from material also found elsewhere:
the quite straightforward 2nd pāda is identical to VII.12.2b. The post-caesura portion
of the first pāda, etárī ná śūṣaíḥ, is also found at V.41.10, where the pre-caesura
portion, gṛṇīté agníḥ “Agni is sung”, is functionally identical to our 2nd pāda (esp.
agní ṣṭave “Agni is praised”). On etárī as a loc., see comm. ad V.41.10; note that this
word is a partial anagram of 3a vanerāṭ.
In c note the insistent phonetic figure: dr(ú)vanno vanván krát(u)vā ná árvā.
The interpr. of pāda d is difficult because of the highly unusual form jārayā́yi,
which has been much discussed (see esp. Old ZDMG 55.302–3). Since the hemistich
otherwise lacks a verb form, it is tempting to see a verb here. But the accent makes
trouble because this is a main clause with no syntactic break evident before the word.
Nonetheless, it is generally taken as a nonce aor. passive and quite possibly a
punning one: as a denom. to jārá- ‘wooer, lover’ (hence ‘become a wooer’) and as a
pass. built to the caus. jāráyati (/ jaráyati) ‘awaken’. The pun is most clearly
expressed in Ge’s tr. “wie der Vater des Uṣas zum Buhlen ward, so wurde er durch
die Opfer erweckt”; he takes it as referring to the myth of incest of Heaven, also
signalled by the phrase usráḥ pitéva “like the father of Dawn.” Although I am always
game (perhaps too game) to see puns everywhere in the RV, I am dubious about the
one suggested here. For one thing the somewhat anomalous stem uṣár-/usr- is never
used for personified Dawn, but only for the temporal dawn. (For supposed voc. uṣar
in I.49.4 see comm. ad loc. and Lundquist 2014.) It seems unlikely that the stem
typed for the goddess, uṣás-, would not be used in this myth where her identity is so
very crucial. Moreover, I rather doubt that usráḥ here is a gen. sg. with pitéva. Not
only is the simile particle wrongly placed (though this is not rare), but usrás is almost
always an acc. pl., which can express extent of time (e.g., VII.15.8). The solution I
favor for jārayā́yi is one also mentioned by Old, stemming from Ludwig, and
endorsed by Debrunner in the Nachtr. to AiG I [p. 163] &ndash; that it belong to a
gerundive stem jārayā́y(i)ya- ‘to be awakened’ and the expected nom. sg. *
jārayā́y(i)yaḥ lost its final syllable by haplology before yajñaíḥ, not surprisingly in
this y(a)-rich environment. This gerundive is predicated and serve in lieu of a finite
verb. For a similarly formed predicated gerundive, see nearby trayayā́y(i)yaḥ at
VI.2.7.</p>
<h3 id="vi125">VI.12.5</h3>
<p>With tákṣat we can supply vánā on the basis of I.127.4, as noticed by the
standard comm.
ṛṇá- is otherwise neut., meaning ‘debt’ (Gr’s supposed fem. ṛṇā́in X.127.7 is
actually a neut. pl.) I am inclined to assume that this masc. nom. sg. is a nonce
application. But see the cmpd. ṛṇa-cyút- ‘shaking the debtor’ in VI.61.1, in which I
also interpr. ṛṇa- as masc. and animate.
The last word of the vs., rāṭ, seems to reprise the similarly pāda-final rā́ṭ in 1a
and vanerā́ṭ in 3a, but because it is unaccented, it must be a verb form belonging to
√rāj ‘go straight’.

<h3 id="vi126">VI.12.6</h3>
<p>In the first pāda as transmitted (metrically faulty), there is a hapax nídāyā(ḥ)
supposed built to a fem. nídā- ‘scorn’. There is no verb to govern this word, so
“protect” vel sim. must be supplied. Ge adduces nearby VI.14.5 nidáḥ … uruṣyáti,
while Gr suggests II.34.15 nidó muñcátha. I am now somewhat more sympathetic to
these makeshifts than I was when I produced the publ. tr., but the fact remains that
protection from scorn would be rather intrusive in the passage, in a hymn that
focuses almost exclusively on Agni’s travel and speed. In the publ. tr. I suggest a
different analysis of the sequence, which I still favor: arvann íd *ā́yāḥ, resegmenting
the Pp. analysis and taking āyā(ḥ) to ā́√yā ‘drive here’. This requires an alteration of
the Saṃhitā text by accenting ā́yāḥ. The posited verb form could be an impf., injunc.,
or subj. to the root pres. to this root, or an indic. or injunc. to the s-aorist. Since no
other such forms occur unambiguously in the RV, it could have been reanalyzed and
lost accent. For a possibly similar form see yā́(ḥ) in V.33.2 and comm. ad loc.
Although the particle íd would be slightly oddly positioned after a voc., it is fairly
regular in pre-verbal position when the verb is final in its pāda (e.g., in this maṇḍala</p>
<h3 id="vi1913">VI.19.13</h3>
<p>śátroḥ-śatror úttara ít syāma, 42.3 dhr̥ṣát tám-tam íd éṣate, 45.7 yó

idhānáḥ#, which would be stronger if the first was ídāyā(ḥ).</p>
<h2 id="vi13-agni">VI.13 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="vi131">VI.13.1</h3>
<p>The voc. ágne was omitted from the publ. tr.
Although śruṣṭī́can represent nom. sg. śruṣṭiḥ and is so taken by Ge, Re (and
seriously entertained by Old), I accept the traditional analysis as instr. sg. (allowed
by Ge in n. 1c); elsewhere the instr. sg. form is almost always pāda-initial as here,
whereas the rare nom. sg. never is. The point seems to be that Agni listens to us
attentively and subsequently metes out rewards.</p>
<h3 id="vi132">VI.13.2</h3>
<p>As usual, the form iṣé is subject to multiple possible analyses, but most
interpr. opt for a dat. of íṣ- ‘refreshment’, as do I. With most (but not Old), I split
pāda a into two nominal clauses, based on the apparently clause-initial sequence ā́hí
after the caesura. The enclitic naḥ must of course belong properly to the 1st clause,
though it can be understood with the 2nd as well.
In pāda b, the referent in the simile qualified as párijmā ‘encompassing’ has
been variously identified: Ge (sim. Lü) Vāyu, Re the sun or Agni solaire, Gr Agni
himself. By contrast, I supply ‘household’ (gáya-), on the basis of nearby VI.2.8,
where Agni is said to be párijmeva … gáyaḥ “encompassing like a household” (on
which see comm. ad loc.). This simile would play on Agni’s well-known connection
to the domestic sphere. The point of comparison is that the household is the unit that
controls the wealth of its members. I supply “over treasure” on the basis of rátnam in
pāda a; kṣayasi in b needs a gen. complement to parallel the simile in c: mitró ná
bṛhatá ṛtásya.
58</p>
<h3 id="vi134">VI.13.4</h3>
<p>The sequence vedyā́naṭ is emended by Old (ZDMG 55.304 and Noten) to
védyā́naṭ with two accents (that is, underlying védyā or védī ‘with the altar’ + ā́naṭ).
He convincingly adduces nearby VI.1.10 védī sūno sahaso gīrbhir ukthaíḥ, identical
to our pāda a save for the first word. See comm. ad loc. The standard interpr. read
vedyā́(Ge, Re, Lub, etc.) with the Pp and render as ‘with wisdom’ vel sim. It’s worth
noting that vedyā́- is otherwise only plural, an argument about ascribing our sg. form
to that stem.
With Ge I think práti vā́ram should be construed together, even though the
standard expression is práti váram (II.11.21, etc.). Re suggests a haplology from
*práti váram vā́ram, but this seems unnecessarily complex. I consider vā́ram from
*váram a minor metrical adjustment to fit a Triṣṭubh cadence. And see immed. below
for another possible lengthening.
Ge takes dhānyà- as ‘grain’, a deriv. of dhānā́- ‘id.’. Certainly the other
occurrence of dhānyà- does have this meaning (V.53.13; cf. also dhānyākṛ́t- X.94.13),
but here a deriv. of dhána- ‘wealth’ makes more sense (see Re’s ‘richesse’). Old
suggests emending to dhányam, which exists in this meaning, but I don’t see the need
for this. Why not simply take it as a (nonce) -ya-suffixed vṛddhi deriv. of dhána- (on
such formations see AiG II.2.834ff.), since vṛddhi derivatives are fairly prominent in
this hymn (saúbhagāni 1a, sauśravasā́5a)?</p>
<h3 id="vi135">VI.13.5</h3>
<p>Despite their distance from each other, the two datives nṛ́bhyaḥ … puṣyáse
seem to form a de facto infinitive phrase: “for men to thrive” &ndash; although it is
certainly possible to construe them as separate datives with dhāḥ “establish (goods)
for men, (goods) for thriving.”
I supply ‘goods’ with the neut. pl. adjectives sauśravasā́suvī́rā, on the basis
of vasavyaìḥ, the last word of the preceding vs. (sim., Re “[choses]”). It would also
be possible, with Ge, to take sauśravasā́as a substantive: “Diese
Ruhmesherrlichkeiten.” Cf. also Thieme (Fremdl., 47).
On first encounter the sentiment of cd is unsettling. What the text seems to
say &ndash; and what I think it does say &ndash; is that Agni provides good things for the
archetypal pair of inimical creatures, the wolf (vṛ́ka-) and the stranger (arí-). (For the
pairing, see, e.g., nearby VI.15.3, where Agni is asked to keep us free of them.) It
seems even worse that what Agni provides in our vs. is “an abundance of livestock”
(bhū́ri paśváḥ; cf. nearby VI.1.12) that becomes váyas- (‘vigor, vital energy’) for
those creatures: in other words he deprives human communities of their domestic
livestock in order to feed hungry wild beasts and outlaws. There have been two basic
responses to this apparent breach of the divine/human compact. Acdg. to Old
(ZDMG 55.305), since Agni provides even for the wolf and so on, he should most
definitely provide at least as much for us. Ge more or less follows this interpr. (see n.
5d), as do I. It is supported by a similar passage in an Aśvin hymn, VII.68.8 (also
adduced by Ge) vṛ́kāya cid jásamānāya śaktam “Do as you are able, even on behalf
of a wolf that is worn out.” Note the cid, which is unfortunately missing in our
passage. (Cf. also VI.45.2 avipré cid váyo dádhat “placing vitality even in the
uninspired,” with the VP váyaḥ √dhā as here and a cid.) By contrast, Thieme
59
(Fremdl., 47), fld. by Re, interprets the dat. phrase vṛ́kāyāráye jásuraye not as a
dative of benefit, but of malefit, as it were: “…wenn du gross machst die Lebenskraft
des Viehs durch deine Stärk für den (i.e. zur Verteidigung gegen den) Wolf, den
Fremdling, der verschmachtet.” The slipperiness of glossing “for” as “for defense
against” seems unacceptable to me, a clear instance of allowing our contextual
expectations to trample the grammar. Th also severs the little formula bhū́ri paśváḥ
(found in nearby VI.1.12, as already noted, as well as III.54.15), taking the gen.
paśváḥ with váyaḥ (“die Lebenskraft des Viehs”) and bhū́ri as part of a phrasal verb
with kṛṇóṣi (“wenn du gross machst”). Re’s interpr. basically follows Th’s, with
some curlicues of its own.
Although Th/Re produce a more acceptable sense, they do so at the expense
of the clarity of the grammar, which is supported by a number of parallel passages. I
think we must accept that Agni is providing for these undesirables. It might be
worthwhile to speculate about what the real world analogue might be. Here I suggest
(with no certainty at all) that this might be a forest fire. MBh I.217–19 depicts the
horrific burning of the Khāṇḍava Forest, in which most of the animal denizens of the
forest were killed in the conflagration and those that tried to escape were cut down
by men stationed at the perimeter. Although in the MBh account there is no
difference between prey animals and their prey &ndash; they all perish &ndash; it does suggest an
analogue, that wolves and outlaw men might capitalize on the panic roused by a
forest fire to capture easy pickings. An internet search turns up a passage in J. F.
Bendell, “Effect of Fire on Birds and Mammals” (in Fire and Ecosystems, ed. T. T.
Kozlowski, 1974), 75: “many birds and mammals are attracted by fires, probably to
feed upon prey driven from their homes. Komarek (1969) mentioned species of birds
in Australia, Africa, and North America that come to and hunt in front of fires.”
On the meter of d see Old ZDMG 55.305 and Noten.</p>
<h3 id="vi136-1">VI.13.6</h3>
<p>Both Ge and Re separate pādas a and b, and Ge’s tr. seems at least
potentially to take the subj. of a, vadmā́, as non-coreferntial with Agni (“Ein Redner
… (werde) uns &hellip; zuteil”), but since vadmán- occurs only here and in nearby VI.4.4,
where it definitely refers to Agni, I do not see the point.
A factor influencing the Ge/Re separation of the pādas may be the apparent
presence of enclitic naḥ in both pādas: … no víhāyā(ḥ)# / … no dāḥ#. However, the
second naḥ should almost certainly be read as the final syllable of the preceding vājí,
thus *vājínaḥ, acc. pl. of vājín-, a possibility floated by Ge in n. 6b. Note only does
this reading eliminate the pleonastic enclitic, but it also eliminates the only supposed
neut. nom./acc. sg. to vājín-, which would be required to modify neut. tókam (e.g.,
Ge “siegestekrönten leiblichen Samen”). A change is only required in the Pp.; the
Saṃhitā text is undisturbed. An asterisk should be inserted in the publ. tr. before
“prize-winning.”
The seemingly late position of naḥ in pāda a, before the final word víhāyāḥ, is
actually not so late after all: it can count as (modified) Wackernagel’s position, after
an accented initial word (vadmā́) followed by the phrasal vocative sūno sahasaḥ.
60</p>
<h2 id="vi14-agni">VI.14 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="vi141">VI.14.1</h3>
<p>This vs. is beset with small difficulties, which add up. To begin with, what
should be done with dúvaḥ in the first pāda? Since the first hemistich has only a
single expressed verb, jujóṣa, the question is whether both dúvaḥ ‘friendship’ and
dhíyam ‘insight’ are objects of this verb. Re (flg. Gonda) takes the two nouns as
appositional and both objects of jujóṣa: “Le mortel qui a-toujours gouté en Agni le
privilège (de) la vision-poétique,” but this depends on his particular interpr. of dúvasand, even with that, doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. Ge in his n. 1ab calls jujóṣa a
Zeugma, which I think ought to mean that both nouns are its object, with slightly
different senses of the verb &ndash; but in fact he supplies a separate verb with dúvaḥ:
“Welcher Sterblicher Agni die schuldige Achtung (erweist) und mit seinen Gedanken
gern (seiner) gedenkt.” Since he seems to take dhíyaṃ jujóṣa as a phrasal verb “gern
(seiner) gedenkt” [think well of him, vel sim.], he may be using Zeugma in a
different sense (unless he’s taking “erweist” as a different sense of jujóṣa). But I do
not see submerging the distinct sense of √juṣ ‘taste, enjoy’ into an anodyne idiom
with dhī́-, ‘think well of’, and I don’t see how he could get that out of the two words
that go into it. In the publ. tr. my solution to the dúvaḥ problem was to supply a form
of √dhā as in IV.8.6 (also adduced by Ge), I.4.5, VII.20.6, all with acc. dúvas- + LOC,
as here. It would also be possible to supply a form of √kṛ, as in III.16.4, IV.2.9,
VIII.31.9 with the same complements. However, the two hymns following this one
each contain a form of √van ‘win’ with dúvas- as obj.: VI.15.6, 16.18, and I would
therefore change my tr. to “(has won/wins) friendship in/by Agni.”
In the second pāda we encounter two closely related stems: the root noun dhī́-
as object of jujóṣa and the instr. dhītíbhiḥ to the -tí-stem to the same root, and some
distinction must be meant. In my opinion, dhītí-, esp. in the plural, are generally the
insightful thoughts of the human poet, whereas dhī́- can be the insight that gods
bestow on that very poet and that gives rise to his dhītí-, and those two values are
found in our passage: the poet savors the dhī́- that Agni provides him, which is
manifested in the poet’s dhītí-.
The second hemistich presents more problems, beginning with the first word:
bhásan is analyzed by the Pp. as bhásat, hence as a finite verb form &ndash; either an
injunc. to a thematic stem bhása- (so Gr, Macd VGS, tentatively Whitney Rts) or the
subjunctive to a root aor. (so Gotō, 1st Kl, 82; also EWA s.v. BHAS1
). This is not
impossible, but I take the underlying form to be the same as the sandhi form, bhásan,
and, with Old (ZDMG 55.305–6, Noten), identify it as a act. part. nom. sg. masc. The
question is to what stem. Although as just noted, the older authorities posit a them.
pres. bhása-, in fact the other two forms to this putative stem, bhásat VI.3.4 and
bhasáthas VI.59.4, are more likely root aor. subjunctives (see Gotō ref. above and
my comm. ad locc.) Of course, a root aor. participle should technically be *psán, but
one wonders how long that would last. In any case, taking it as a finite form would
not appreciably change the meaning of the hemistich; in that case I would alter the tr.
to “he will chew it now; he should …”
61
The pāda-medial sequence X nú ṣá prá is somewhat puzzling, since both ṣá
and prá seem out of place. Gr takes prá with bhásan, but I think it goes more
naturally with vurīta, though in either case the position of the preverb is odd. I’m
also not sure what, if anything, the retroflection of ṣá after nú is telling us. I have
found no other examples of this sequence, though cf. VIII.27.18 with … páro nú sā́#,
without retroflection.
The next question is what √bhas ‘bite, chew’ is doing in this context. Ge tr.
“der soll zuerst den Mund auftun,” remarking in his n. 1c that it means something
like ‘yawn, gape’ &ndash; but he doesn’t explain what this means in context. Both Old and
Re supply “enemies” as obj. (e.g., Old “… möge (seine Feinde) zermalmend”); this
makes somewhat more sense, esp. given the hostile sentiments later in the hymn. But
I think it can be better integrated into the context of the vs. in which it’s found. The
vs. has a sequence of verbs √juṣ ‘taste, savor, enjoy’ &ndash; √bhas ‘bite, chew’ &ndash; íṣam
√vṛ ‘choose (as) refreshment / nourishment’, all centering on eating. In my view they
all take the same object, dhíyam, and all metaphorically refer to the mortal poet’s
eating the insight that Agni has conferred on him &ndash; that is, consuming it and turning
it into his own substance. It is a striking image.</p>
<h3 id="vi143">VI.14.3</h3>
<p>As discussed ad IV.48.1 and VI.1.5, I take the phrase rā́yo aryáḥ “the riches
of the stranger” here and in IV.48.1 (cf. also VI.47.9; also aryáḥ … rayíḥ in VI.20.1)
and the phrase rā́ya ubháyāso jánānām “both the riches of the peoples” in VI.1.5 as
referring metaphorically to people, as the most valuable resource of a society. In our
passage there are three different parallel designations for these same people: “the
clans of Manu” (mánuṣo víśaḥ) understood from the last pāda of the previous vs. (2d),
“the riches of the Ārya” (pāda b), and “the Āyus” (āyávaḥ in c). To make matters
more complex, these people are not only contending among themselves &ndash; that is,
divided and engaging in internal conflict &ndash; but are also fighting united against
common enemies, namely the Dasyu (dásyum) and one without commandment
(avratám), as was already seen by Ge (n. 3). This is the usual “fission and fusion”
model of Rigvedic society, as discussed at length by Proferes (2007, esp. Chap. 2).
The internal conflict is expressed in the first hemistich by the reciprocal verb
spárdhante ‘they contend with each other’, while the second hemistich concerns their
joint enterprises, expressed by the participles tū́rvantaḥ ‘overcoming’ and sī́kṣantaḥ
‘seeking to vanquish’.</p>
<h3 id="vi144">VI.14.4</h3>
<p>The hero whom Agni bestows here is the concrete realization of the help
(ávas-) sought in vss. 1 and 3.
The standard interpr. (though not Gr) construe śávasaḥ with bhiyā́“with fear
of his vast power.” This is certainly possible, but a construction with saṃcákṣi seems
equally possible and the adjacency of the two words (though across a pāda boundary)
very weakly supports my interpr.</p>
<h3 id="vi145">VI.14.5</h3>
<p>By my interpr. rayíḥ here has the same metaphorical sense as rā́yaḥ in 3,
namely manpower, or perhaps more narrowly the hero given by Agni in 4. Both Ge
62
and Re take sahā́vā ‘victorious’ as an epithet of Agni, despite the hemistich boundary.
This is presumably because the adj. is felt to be more appropriate for an animate
being than for wealth &ndash; but this problem disappears if we take wealth figuratively for
manpower. (They may also unconsciously take the 2nd position of yásya in c as an
indication that the rel. cl. begins there, though of course they regularly interpret 2nd
position relatives correctly.) The repeated adj. ávṛtaḥ is also better applied to an
animate being (4x of Indra, once [oddly] of barhis), and it must belong to the rel. cl.</p>
<h2 id="vi15-agni">VI.15 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="vi151-1">VI.15.1</h3>
<p>On ṛñjase see comm. ad IV.8.1. A tr. “aim at/towards” would be more
transparent here.
The problematic pāda here is c: diváḥ, kác cid, and ā́are difficult to construe
and interpret. Ge takes the first as referring to ‘day’ rather than ‘heaven’ and makes
it dependent on kác cid: “zu jeglicher Zeit des Tages,” but diváḥ is far more often
‘heaven’ than ‘day’ (the latter sense usually confined to use with trír ā́and a few
temporal adverbs). Re takes diváḥ as an abl. of ‘heaven’ (“Il s’avance du ciel”), and
he takes the kác cid adverbially with jánuṣā … śúciḥ (“pur de toute manière quant à
la naissance,” where the indefinite sense of kác cid has been replaced by a totalizing
one). In the publ. tr. I agree with Re in taking diváḥ as ablative of ‘heaven’,
construing it with distant ā́, and supply ‘food’ with kác cid. But I now don’t think this
makes much sense. I will suggest an alternative that makes more sense, but that
doesn’t solve all the difficulties and requires some special pleading.
First I’d observe that the word order in this pāda seems particularly contorted.
I ascribe this to the position of janúṣā: this instr. occurs 20 times in the RV and it
always occurs immediately after the caesura, whatever its function in the clause. In
this particular case, it is generally agreed that janúṣā should be construed with śúciḥ
(see Ge’s n. 1c), despite the intervening material. I’d argue that the need to plunk
down janúṣā smack in the middle of the pāda has disrupted the constituencies of the
rest of the pāda as well. Therefore, we cannot use word order and adjacency as
reliable guides here (even less so than in the rest of the RV).
Now, let’s start with the verb véti, which opens the pāda, and with the
observation that the poet of this hymn is supposed to be Vītahavya, who is in fact
mentioned in both the other vss. of the tṛca (2c, 3d). If we decompose this cmpd.
name we can make a putative havyám ‘oblation’ the object of véti (cf. I.74.4 véṣi
havyā́ni; sim. III.53.1, VI.60.15, etc.; for similar gapping in this hymn, see 14b),
which can be qualified by kác cid: “he pursues any (oblation) whatever.” I further
suggest that diváḥ should be construed with ā́, as in my publ. interpr., but that here ā́
means ‘all the way to X’, rather than ‘from X here’. Although in the ‘all the way to’
sense, ā́normally precedes the ablative (see Gr, s.v. ā́), as already noted, the word
order in this pāda seems particularly scrambled, and, in any case, ā́often follows an
acc. in the ‘to’ sense. I would therefore now substitute the tr. “Just he, blazing from
birth, pursues any oblation whatever all the way to heaven.” This would be a
63
description of the flames rising up towards heaven as they carry the oblation up to
the gods.
The next pāda is implicitly contrastive: although the flames of the ritual fire
actively reach for heaven in pāda c, the fire itself, just kindled, starts by burning the
kindling sticks, which are immovable as opposed to the oblation later poured into the
fire.
The cadence of d is bad.</p>
<h3 id="vi152">VI.15.2</h3>
<p>The first hemistich treats Agni in the accusative, so that no grammatical
person needs to be expressed. It therefore appears to continue the 3rd ps. of vs. 1, but
modulates to the 2nd ps. reference of cd.</p>
<h3 id="vi154">VI.15.4</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., this initial vs. of the 2nd tṛca is a variant on the
1st hemistich of the 1st tṛca: in their first pādas an opening of 5 ending in vo is
followed by átithim; the end of the 2nd pāda of vs. 1, ṛñjase girā́, is reprised by 4cd …
suvṛktíbhiḥ, … ṛñjase.</p>
<h3 id="vi155">VI.15.5</h3>
<p>In b both Ge and Re take uṣásaḥ as a nom. pl. rather than a gen. sg. as I do
(e.g., “commes les aurores avec leur rayon”). Either would work contextually.
However, in IV.1.17 in the phrase uṣáso bhānúḥ (like our uṣáso ná bhānúnā), uṣásaḥ
has to be gen. sg. and Ge so interprets it there.
In c and d I take the crucial terms with double reference, in both simile and
frame. In c this term is the pres. part. tū́rvan: in the frame it refers to Agni and is
construed with loc. yā́man “going in triumph on his course”; in the simile it is
construed with loc. ráṇe “like the victor in the battle.” The battle with (lit. of) Etaśa
is a reference to the conflict between Indra and the Sun involving the Sun’s horse
Etaśa in some unfortunately puzzling way. To make this clear, “battle over Etaśa
would be a better rendering, as MLW points out to me. A further resonance of this
phrase tū́rvan ná yā́man is the PN Tūrvayāṇa found several times in the RV, incl.
nearby VI.18.13.
nū́in c seems to have no function and is curiously positioned, though it might
be noted that there&rsquo;s a minority position of nú/nū́, penultimate in the pāda, and this is
fairly common in VI.
As for d, the standard interpr. (Old ZDMG 313 + Noten, Ge, Re) take the part.
tatṛṣānáḥ only with the simile; this requires supplying an elaborate verbal predicate
(“goes to water”) that is not found in the Sanskrit; cf., e.g., Old “er der herbei (eilt)
wie im Sonnenbrand der Durstende (zum Wasser eilt).” I again think that the
participle applies in both simile and frame: in the simile it refers to someone
becoming thirsty in the (sun’s) heat, whereas in the frame it refers to Agni “thirsting”
for oblations. This participle is used unambiguously of Agni elsewhere (I.31.7,
II.4.6) in describing his voracious appetite for fuel.
In a clever poetic trick the sun is referred to indirectly in both c (his horse
Etaśa) and d (his heat: ghṛṇá-).
64</p>
<h3 id="vi156">VI.15.6</h3>
<p>The locatival inf. gṛṇīṣáṇi occurs only here and in VIII.12.19. Curiously, in
both passages it is construed with āmreḍitas: here priyám-priyam … átithim
(matching agním-agnim in pāda a), in VIII.12.19 deváṃ-devam … índram-indram. I
don’t quite know what to do with this fact. Keydana (p. 178) takes it as a
“Matrixinfinitiv” functionally equivalent to an imperative, pointing to impv.
duvasyata in pāda a. However, it would also be possible to interpret it as I do, with
duvasyata the main verb of both pādas and the infinitive an adverbial adjunct to both
pādas. I would change the tr. of the āmreḍitas, however, to one more in harmony
with that in VIII.12.19: “Time after time do friendly service to the fire with a
kindling stick, time after time to your dear guest, in hymning (him).”
The morphology of gṛṇīṣáṇi is of course unusual, though it belong with the
small group of RV -san-i locatival infinitives, some of which (cf. esp. upastṛṇīṣáṇi,
which, however, I now consider to be based on gṛṇīṣáṇi; see comm. ad VI.44.6) are
built to already derived verbal stems (see AiG II.2.924–25). In this passage it
phonologically echoes ghṛṇé and tatṛṣāṇáḥ in the preceding vs. (5d), and in the next
vs. (which also belongs to the next tṛca) pāda-final gṛṇe, which is also of course
etymologically related.</p>
<h3 id="vi157">VI.15.7</h3>
<p>This vs. begins a new tṛca, but seems like a mish-mash of the vss. that
precede it. The 1st pāda, sámiddham agníṃ samídhā girā́gṛṇe, telescopes vs. 6:
agním-agnim … samídhā (a), gṛṇīṣáṇi (b), gī́rbhiḥ (c). It also contains two
etymological figures (sámiddham … samídhā and girā́gṛṇe). The next pāda, śúcim
pāvakám puró adhvaré dhruvám, is more eclectic in its sources: śúciḥ (1c), pāvakáyā
(5a), svadhvarám (4b); pāda-final dhruvám has no direct correspondent, but resonates
with both dúvaḥ (pāda-final in 6e) and adrúham, which ends the next pāda (7c). The
first two words of pāda c, vípraṃ hótāram have correspondents in 4c and b
respectively. Only pāda d breaks significantly new ground.</p>
<h3 id="vi159">VI.15.9</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. fails to tr. dūtó devā́nām. The tr. should be emended to “… as
messenger of the gods, you speed …”
The lexeme ví √bhūṣ occurs only here and I.112.4 until Epic, and it is not
entirely clear what it means here. “Seeking manifestation” of the publ. tr. depends on
the usage of rare ví √bhū, which can mean ‘become manifest’; an example is found
(at least by my lights) in vs. 14. But it might have the less marked meaning
‘becoming conspicuous, distinguished’ or ‘becoming extended/extensive’. In any
case it picks up vibhúm, which opens the last pāda of the preceding vs. Note also the
polarized preverbs ví and sám at opposite ends of the hemistich.
The Pp. takes ubháyām̐as acc. pl. masc. ubháyān (so also Gr), but as Old
suggests (ZDMG 55.313, Noten), it could be neut. pl. ubháyā with nasalization in
hiatus, and a neut. pl. construed with vratā́is an attractive choice here. The phrase
ubháyā(m) ̐ ánu vratā́“following both (kinds of) commandments” would of course
refer to those of gods and men, who were mentioned in 8c.

<h3 id="vi1510">VI.15.10</h3>
<p>This vs. is rhetorically pleasing, though unremarkable in content. It opens
with three cmpds with su- as first member, all in the realm of appearance (at least as
I interpret the sequence) suprátīkaṃ suḍṛ́śaṃ s(u)váñcam. The next pāda juxtaposes a
negated form of the pf. part. of √vid with a comparative built to the same stem
(though different allomorph), ávidvāṃso vidúṣṭaram, picked up by a third form to
this participle, vidvā́n, at the end of the next pāda &ndash; which itself participates in an
alliterative sequence víśvā vayúnāni vidvā́n.
svàñc- of course patterns and inflects with the -añc- stems, generally built to
preverbs/adverbs in the meaning of ‘directed’ (e.g., údañc- ‘directed upward’), and
in 2 of its 6 occurrences (IV.6.9, VII.56.16) the context favors the sense ‘welldirected’ (VI.58.4 is unclear). But here, as well as in similar adjectival sequences in
VII.10.3 and in IX.73.7, it appears with words referring to seeing or appearance, and
I suggest that this usage preserves a semantic relic of the ‘eye’ word (*h3eku̯
) that,
according to most, is one contributor to the blend that produces the hybrid suffix -
añc- (see, e.g., AiG III.230). I therefore render it in these contexts as ‘of lovely
outlook’ (contra Ge’s ‘schön von … Bewegung’). Re’s ‘de belle allure’ avoids the
directional sense and may reflect an analysis similar to mine, but he does not
comment. A zero-grade of the ‘eye’ word is also buried in prátīka-, also found in our
sequence (suprátīka-), and in ánīka, which contributes svanīka- in 16a (for both see
EWA s.vv.).
Although pāda-final vidvā́n is generally used absolutely, here it must take an
object, vayúnāni.
The clear s-aor. subj. yakṣat in c invites a subjunctive reading of vocat in the
next pāda, though it is of course injunctive. Nonetheless, modal readings are quite
common for this stem.</p>
<h3 id="vi1511">VI.15.11</h3>
<p>This vs. is unusually conjunction-heavy, with utá in pāda a (conjoining
clauses) and in d (conjoining nouns), and vā 3x in c. In fact there at first appear to be
more vā’s than there are constituents to conjoin: yajñásya vā níśitiṃ vā-úditiṃ vā.
However, Klein (DGRV II.195) plausibly explains the first vā as sentential (I would
prefer the term ‘clausal’ in this case), connecting pāda b with its relative clause yáḥ &hellip;
ā́naṭ … with its continuation in pāda c. The other two vā’s are subclausal, conjoining
the two -ti-stem action noun phrases, níśitiṃ vā-úditiṃ vā, both of which govern the
gen. yajñásya, the constituency being interrupted by the clausal vā in Wackernagel’s
position.
In c I assume that the verb is a gapped repetition of ā́naṭ. Klein tr. the skeleton
of bc as “who has attained … or (has brought about) …,” so I assume he thinks c has
a different underlying verb from b. But the full VP níśitim … ā́naṭ in nearby VI.13.4,
as well as VI.2.5 níśitim … naśat also in this Agni cycle, establish this as a ritual
idiom.
Note the complementary preverbs ní ‘down’ and úd ‘up’ in the conjoined
níśitim … úditim. The latter word is not otherwise used as a ritual term; in all its
other occurrences it is a loc. and refers to the rising of the sun. Here it seems to refer
to the outcome or the progress of the sacrifice, though it could be more narrowly
66
used for the “rising up” of the fire when it is kindled. This is probably the better
interpr. because in 2 of the 4 occurrences of níśiti-, VI.2.5 and VIII.19.14, it is
implicitly use of the fire.</p>
<h3 id="vi1512">VI.15.12</h3>
<p>The problematic pāda here is c. The initial sám in both c and d and the fact
that d otherwise contains only a phrase in the nominative invite us to assume that c
and d have the same structure and that we should supply the verb abhy ètu from c for
d, as well as, quite possibly, tvā. But though the NP in d, “thousandfold desirable
wealth,” is something we would quite naturally invite to “come to you entirely,” the
general assumption is that dhvasmanvát, whether it modifies pā́thaḥ ‘fold’ (Gr, Re)
or not (Old, Ge), refers to something undesirable &ndash; e.g., Old’s (ZDMG 55.313)
tentative “was voll von Zerfall [decay] ist.” It is therefore uncomfortable to invite it
to come anywhere near Agni or us. Certainly both occurrences of its base dhvasmán-
(IV.6.6, VIII.66.15) are in fact in negative contexts. But the substance itself, smoke,
is semantically neutral, and in this ritual context something ‘possessing smoke’ can
be positive: the oblation as it is poured into the fire will be surrounded by smoke, and,
by one model of the sacrifice, it will go to the gods in Agni’s smoke as that smoke
rises to heaven. I therefore supply havyám here (found in this tṛca in 10d), and take
tvā and pā́thaḥ as two sequential accusatives of goal. Agni is the first destination of
the smoke-wrapped oblation, which must be poured into the fire, but it then goes to
“the fold (of the gods)” for their consumption &ndash; devā́nām is a standard dependent
gen. with pā́thaḥ (esp. in Āprī hymns, II.3.9, III.8.9, etc.).</p>
<h3 id="vi1513">VI.15.13</h3>
<p>Pāda b is nicely configured: víśvā veda jánimā jātávedāḥ. The first two and
the last two words alliterate. The final word, the epithet jātávedas-, is immediately
preceded by two independent words etymologically related to its two members (in
reverse order): veda to -vedāḥ, jánimā to jātá-. (Of course, -vedas- may ultimately
derive from √vid ‘find, possess’, but at least folk-etymologically it belongs with √vid
‘know’.) And víśvā veda evokes the cmpd viśvá-vedas-, a parallel formation to jātávedas-. Nothing profound here, but a pleasing way to deploy four words.</p>
<h3 id="vi1514">VI.15.14</h3>
<p>The first pāda is a 13-syllable Triṣṭubh; as Old notes (ZDMG 55.313 and
Noten), it would be possible to delete init. ágne without affecting sense, but on the
other hand it is difficult to see why it would have been secondarily appended.
In pāda a it is unclear how to construe viśáḥ. Note first that by accent it must
be abl./gen. sg., not acc. pl. (víśaḥ). Ge (see n. 14ab) takes it as a second gen. with
following voc. hotaḥ, but in that case we would expect viśáḥ to lose its accent in the
voc. phrase (as adhvaryasya has), and, further, viśó hótar- is not a standard title, as
far as I can find. It might be possible to supply <em>páti- “(lord) of the clan,” matching
gṛhápatiḥ in the previous vs. (13a), next to hótā; cf. viśpátiḥ in 8d. However, I think
the most likely solution is similar to the one also proposed for 1c &ndash; to supply havyám
as the object of véḥ in b (see havyā́in d), with viśáḥ dependent on havyám. Recall
that the poet’s name is Vītahavya, and he seems to like concealed puns on his name.
As a support for their connection, note that the two phonologically similar words
67
viśáḥ and véṣ take the same position in their respective pādas. Re’s solution is
somewhat similar to mine, with viśáḥ dependent on an object supplied for véḥ, but
his proposed object is “la fonction du messager” and he makes adhvarasya a parallel
gen. to viśáḥ ignoring its lack of accent. His supplied obj. dūtyā̀ni is certainly
conceivable: he adduces IV.7.8 vér adhvarásya dūtyā̀ni … But to my mind the pun
on the name of the poet weighs more heavily.
In pāda b there is close sandhi in the sequence véṣ ṭ(u)vám; the reason for this
is unclear, esp. since by all standard interpr. (incl. mine) t(u)vám belongs to a new
clause &ndash; the parenthetical one marked by hí &ndash; and so there is a particularly sharp
syntactic boundary between them.
In c mahinā́fits semantically much better in the subordinate yád clause than in
the main clause (and is so taken by the standard interpr.), but it seems to be
positioned too far to the left, with another element interposed before the
subordinator: … mahinā́ví yád bhū́ḥ. I attribute this word order disturbance to the
same factor that caused trouble in 1c: like janúṣā, mahinā́only occurs immediately
after the caesura in trimeter vs. Given this constraint, the only possible adjustment to
produce the expected sequence would be an ordering mahinā́</em>yád ví, which would
put the subordinator in the correct 2nd position of its clause but produce a bad
Triṣṭubh cadence (– – ⏑ ×). A somewhat similar situation is found in II.1.15c pṛkṣó
yád átra mahinā́ví te bhúvat, where mahinā́causes some distortion in word order,
though the placement of the subordinator is not affected.
With Lüders (438) I take ṛtā́as neut. acc. pl. and supply ‘hymns’ (Lieder),
rather than taking it as an instr. sg.; this interpr. is supported by VII.39.1 ṛtám …
yajāti, with the neut. sg. acc.
Note the phonetic interplay of v, h, and y in d havyā́vaha yaviṣṭha yā́…</p>
<h3 id="vi1515">VI.15.15</h3>
<p>As Old points out (see publ. intro.), this is no doubt the last vs. of this
collection of tṛcas, with vss. 16–19 later additions. There is some faint sign of ring
composition with the first tṛca: súdhitāni in pāda a reprises súdhitam in 2a, as dadhīta
with Agni as object does dadhúḥ also in 2a. The last three pādas of this vs., esp. de,
appear to be a refrain: pāda e is identical to VI.2.11e = 14.6e in this Agni cycle, and
pāda d ágne víśvāni duritā́tarema is a variant of VI.2.11d = 14.6d dviṣó áṃhāṃsi
duritā́tarema, hence my supplied “narrow straits” here. These refrain pādas also
signal that the hymn (or the tṛcas loosely collected into a hymn) once ended here.
On the anomalous position of hí here, see comm. ad III.31.12, where the
idiosyncratic behavior of √khyā is discussed. Here the immediate preverbal position
of hí is esp. anomalous because the preverb abhí has been fronted (as opposed to
III.31.12 … ví hí kyán #, where the preverb stays in the verb complex).</p>
<h3 id="vi1516">VI.15.16</h3>
<p>The phrase “wooly womb” (ū́rṇāvantam yónim) is striking as a designation
of Agni’s seat. Ge (n. 16b) thinks it refers to the barhis, but in fact the fire is not
placed on that dry grass, which might produce a conflagration disruptive to the ritual.
I think it must rather refer to twigs and foliage still present on the firewood.
68
In agreement with Ge (who is hesitant &ndash; see n. 16c) and Re, I see a verseinternal enjambment: the two accusatives directly after the hemistich boundary,
kulāyínaṃ ghṛtávantam, qualify yónim, which ends pāda b; then there is a syntactic
break in the middle of the pāda, with dat. savitré construed with d, not c. This is
unusual, but it is difficult to find a function for savitré in the preceding clause.</p>
<h3 id="vi1517">VI.15.17</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take aṅkūyánt- as a positive quality parallel to ámūra-; e.g., Re:
“(dieu) faiseur de méandres, (dieu) exempt d’egarement.” I think rather that they are
opposites and that the vs. concerns the flight of Agni and his recovery by the gods:
note the imperfect ā́nayan (Pp. ā́ánayan, though technically it could be ā́nayan with
an injunctive). Though Agni sought to elude the gods by taking a circuitous course,
they found him and brought him straight back from the dark depths of the water. The
“dark places” can of course also refer to the night, after which the ritual fire is
kindled, but I think the primary reference is mythological.</p>
<h3 id="vi1518">VI.15.18</h3>

<p>The slangy asthūrí ‘not one-horse’ is appropriate to this later addition to

<p>The tr. “for the human race” reads like a dative, but mā́nuṣe jáne is of
course a locative. Unfortunately English lacks the “bei” / “chez” locution that would
idiomatically tr. this loc.
VI.16.2–3: The first pādas of these vss. end respectively in adhvaré# and ádhvanaḥ#,
which seems to signal an awareness of the deeper etym. relationship between the two
stems.</p>
<h3 id="vi163">VI.16.3</h3>
<p>Klein (DGRV II.122) tr. b patháś ca devā́
ñjasā as “and the paths going straight
unto the heavenly ones,” apparently reading devā́
ñjasā as a cmpd., contrary to the Pp.
and all standard tr. (incl. mine), which separate deva as a voc. Although I think the voc.
interpretation is correct, cf. X.73.7 pathó devatrā́ñjaseva yā́nān “… the paths as if going
straight to the gods,” with the adv. devatrā́immed. preceding and construed with
áñjasā. On the basis of X.73.7 and similar phraseology, Insler (KZ 82 [1968] “Vedic
áñjasā, ṛñjasāná-, and the Type sahasāná-,” p. 6) takes devā́
ñjasā as a shortening of
devatrā́
ñjasā or “a type of haplological abbreviation of devayā́
nān áñjasā” or possibly
even directly as an “adverbial-type compound” devāñjásā, and Klein must be flg. the
Insler interpr. one way or the other. Although X.73.7 is suggestive, I do not think it is
sufficient to allow the rather extreme type of haplology posited by Insler.
VI.16.4–6: As noted in the publ. intro., each vs. in this tṛca begins with a form of the 2nd
69
sg. prn., although all three are slightly different: the acc. sg. t(u)vā́
m in 4a shows
distraction; both 5a and 6a contain the nom. sg., but the 1st is undistracted, the 2nd
distracted.</p>
<h3 id="vi164">VI.16.4</h3>
<p>Klein (DGRV II.122) ascribes “logical conjunctive value ‘therefore’” to ádha here,
connecting vss. 3 and 4. But since vs. 4 begins a new tṛca, it seems unlikely that vs. 4 is
being conjoined to the tṛca-final vs. 3. Moreover, ádha here is displaced from its usual
pāda-initial position to immediately precede dvitā́, as it does several times elsewhere
(I.132.3, VIII.1.28, 84.2, all pāda-final as here; also pāda-initial VIII.13.24 = IX.102.1,
VIII.83.8). On the preceding page (DGRV II.121) Klein calls ádha dvitā́a collocation and
gives it “quasi-formulaic status.” The occurrence here must belong to this group.
In b bharató vājíbhiḥ “Bharata with his prize-winner” is an untranslatable pun on
the poet’s name Bharad-vāja, whose name appears in the next vs. (5c).
The ritualistic verbs īḷe ‘reverently invoke’ (a) and ījé ‘sacrifice’ (c) are exact
rhymes (save for accent). I take them here as 3rd sg. , as do Ge and Re. Although the 3rd
sg. to the former stem is usually īṭṭ́ e with īḷ
́
e the 1st sg., in this context a 3rd sg. reading is
favored, and the lack of accent on īḷe allows it to be drawn into the morphological orbit
of the pf. ījé (cf. 3rd sg. perfect-accented īḍé in IV.3.3). Kü (389), flg. Tichy, takes both
verbs as 1st sg., which is equally possible, as long as Bharata is referring to himself by
name: “You do I, Bharata, reverently invoke …”</p>
<h3 id="vi165">VI.16.5</h3>
<p>A verb must be supplied in this vs., with ‘give’ being the obvious choice.</p>
<h3 id="vi166">VI.16.6</h3>
<p>The “divine race” (daívyaṃ jánam) here may resonate with the “human race,
race stemming from Manu” (mā́nuṣe jáne) in 1c, though they belong to different
tṛcas.
VI.16.7–9: This tṛca likewise has a form of the 2nd sg. prn. beginning each vs. (7
t(u)vā́m, 8 táva, 9 t(u)vám), again all different.</p>
<h3 id="vi168">VI.16.8</h3>
<p>(prá) yakṣi is morphologically ambiguous &ndash; 2nd sg. act. -si impv. or 1st sg.
middle s-aor. &ndash; and opinion is divided: Old (ZDMG 55.314, Noten) dithers and
doesn’t ultimately decide; Ge, Narten (Sig.Aor. 200–201), and Klein (DGRV I.385)
opt for the 1st sg., Re for the 2nd but to the root √yakṣ. A strong factor in favor of a 2nd
sg. to √yaj is the presence of an undoubted form of this same -si impv. in the
following vs. (9c; cf. also 2c); in favor of a non-2nd-sg. interpr. is the difficulty of
construing pāda-initial táva with such an impv. I consider the form the 2nd sg. act. to
√yaj, on the basis not only of 9c but also vs. 13 in the previous hymn (VI.15), where
Agni is the subj. of a (pres.) impv. to prá √yaj: VI.15.13d yájiṣṭḥaḥ sá prá yajatām
ṛtā́vā “let him, the best sacrificer, the truthful one, set the sacrifice in motion.” What
then to do with the rest of the first two pādas? I accept Ludwig’s suggestion
(registered by Old) that prá yakṣi is a parenthesis &ndash; or rather, I think that, because of
the rigid parallel patterning in this tṛca, táva, which belongs with the clause
beginning saṃdṛ́śam, has been fronted around the peremptory impv. prá yakṣi, and
70
that it is dependent on the NP saṃdṛ́śam utá krátum: “your manifestation and resolve
do they take pleasure in.” This is, strictly speaking, ungrammatical, but rhetoric
occasionally trumps syntax.</p>
<h3 id="vi1610">VI.16.10</h3>
<p>Both Ge and Re supply ‘gods’ as the underlying object of vītáye, and this is
supported by devávītaye in vs. 7 (and 41). But as in the previous hymn (VI.15.1, 14),
I think the default object of √vī here is havyá-, suggested by the name Vīta-havya,
the poet to whom VI.15 is ascribed. Here the havyá- can easily be extracted from the
parallel purpose dative havyá-dātaye in b and its absence explained as gapping.
However, the Ge/Re solution is certainly possible, and there are no major
implications either way.
VI.16.13–15: Another tṛca with fronted ‘you’ beginning all three vss., though here
the 2nd two occurrences actually involve the enclitic with preposed pronominal prop:
14–15 tám u tvā, as opposed to 13 tvā́m. This tṛca is also characterized by snippets of
mythology, contrasting with the otherwise monotonous focus on the standard ritual
tropes. Unfortunately the snippets are just that &ndash; they remain undeveloped.
This tṛca is recited in śrauta ritual during the churning of the fire; see Krick
(Feuergründung, 297)</p>
<h3 id="vi1613">VI.16.13</h3>
<p>On the ritual use of the lotus and the relevance of this vs., see Krick
(Feuergründung, 155–59), where (155) she calls this vs. “die Primärquelle für die
Verwendung eines Lotusblattes im Feuerritual.”
In c vāghátaḥ can be gen. sg. or nom. pl. (as I take it, with Ge and Re). Since I
don’t know what’s going on here, I would certainly not exclude the gen. sg.: “…
(churned) from the head of every vāghát” (so Krick 297) It is perhaps relevant that
víśvasya vāghátaḥ phonologically echoes víśvasya jágataḥ “of the whole world”
(I.101.5, IV.13.3, VI.50.7, VII.60.2, 101.2, X.73.8).</p>
<h3 id="vi1616">VI.16.16</h3>
<p>The stem ítara- is very rare in the RV and has a late distribution: besides
this passage it is found only in the funeral hymns X.16.9–10 and X.18.1. This
comparative isolation makes it difficult to determine its nuance here. Both Ge and Re
(cf. also Klein DGRV I.266, Oberlies RdR I.242) think the phrase “other hymns”
(ítarā gíraḥ) refers to the hymns of a rival sacrificer (or sacrificers), and certainly the
-tara- suffix implies a choice of two, which has the further potential implication that
one of them is bad. But, though the publ. tr. rather vaguely reflects this interpr., I
now think it is likely wrong. Instead, I think that the implicit contrast is between itthā́
‘in just this way’ and ítara-, and I further think that ítarā gíraḥ is the acc. obj. of
brávāṇi, not the nom. subj. of a nominal clause in embedded direct speech. By this
interpr. the speaker is telling Agni that in addition to the hymn or hymns he [=Agni]
has already heard, the speaker will tell him other hymns in the same manner as the
previous ones. In other words, he is promising a continuation of the recitation that
has already pleased Agni, as well as promising to strengthen him with a physical
offering — the usual pairing of verbal and physical in the sacrifice. This interpr.
71
follows that of Hertha Krick (Feuergründung, p. 571): “Komm herbei, Agni, schön
will ich dir auf solche Weise noch andere Lobpreisungen sagen! Durch diese Tropfen
sollst du wachsen.” I would now emend the tr. to “Come here. I will speak other
hymns to you, Agni, in this same way, and with these drops here you will become
strong.”
Oberlies claims that this is one of the only places in the RV that soma is
pressed for Agni, but I do not see why the drops (índu-) can’t be drops of ghee. To be
sure, índu- overwhelmingly refers to soma drops, but I don’t think that soma has to
be the referent.</p>
<h3 id="vi1617">VI.16.17</h3>
<p>Note the phonological resonance between 16b ítarāḥ and 17b úttaram.
The temptation is very strong to take dadhase, despite its lack of accent, as the
verb of the subord. cl. introduced by yátra kvà ca in pāda a, whose correlate tátra
begins the last pāda (c). And indeed almost all interpr. (Old, Ge, Re, Klein DGRV
I.266) have succumbed to this temptation. Old (ZDMG 55. 314–15) constructs an
elaborate justification for the interpr., which he maintains in the Noten (though
without the extensive special pleading). But despite Old’s claim (Noten) that
“dadhase kann nicht ohne Gezwungenheit als Hautptsatzverb aufgefasste werden,” I
see no problem. I agree that a form of √dhā should be supplied in the yátra clause &ndash;
perhaps hitám, as in I.187.6 tvé … máno hitám. The main clause of b, with its shortvowel subjunctive dadhase, expresses the next step in the process: after he has set his
mind on something, he then will apply his skill to it &ndash; the progression from mental
conception to physical realization that we frequently encounter in the RV. I take
úttara- here not as a qualification of value, ‘higher’ (e.g., Klein’s “higher skill”), but
as a temporal or logical ‘next, later’ expressing the progress from a to b. The tátra
clause of c gives us a third step, but the fact that this adverb correlates with yátra
does not mean that the intermediate clause has to be under the domain of yátra.
VII.16.18: It is not clear whether te pūrtám refers to a gift given to Agni or by him.
The publ. tr. takes it in the former sense, assuming that our gift to Agni will trigger
his own actions for us in pāda c, in the standard reciprocal model of Vedic sacrifice.
Scar (293), in keeping with his interpr. of nemānām (see below), also thinks it’s a gift
to Agni, but from others (“was [dir von anderen] geschenkt wird”). Re (see esp. his n.
expanding his tr.) takes it as Agni’s gift to us, and I interpr. Ge’s “deine Schenkung”
in the same fashion. In fact, either interpr. is possible, and the choice will be
influenced by one’s interpr. of pāda c.
The stem néma-, cognate to Aves. naēma- ‘half’, is implicitly oppositional,
picking out one moiety or side, or simply “some” out of a larger group. Here the
unaccented gen. pl. nemānām, part of the voc. phrase headed by vaso, refers, in my
view, to our side. This is clearly Ge’s view because he footnotes his slightly awk.
“du Gott der einen Partei” with “Der Fromme oder Arier.” Other renderings are so
awkward as to be almost unintelligible: Re “o Vasu, (dieu) de quelques-uns,” Klein
(DGRV II.71) “o Vasu of some (races).” And Scar (293) takes it as referring to the
opposition (“o du Vasu der andere”), which then requires Agni to do some amends-
72
making in pāda c. I consider it extremely unlikely that the poet would address Agni,
the focus of his praise, as a god of just some people, diluting his power and denying
his omnipresence &ndash; much less as a god of others. I might, however, slightly modify
the publ. tr. from “on (our) side” to “of (our) side.”
At first glance pāda c, átho dúvo vanavase, with its middle voice seems to
involve Agni’s winning dúvas- for himself. This would be compatible with the Ge/Re
interpr. of pāda a: if Agni gives us a not insignificant gift in pāda a, he has a good
chance of winning our dúvas- in c. However, the almost identical expression in the
immediately preceding hymn, VI.15.6d devó devéṣu vánate hí no dúvaḥ “for the god
will win friendship for us among the gods,” with the crucial loc. devéṣu and dat. of
benefit naḥ, suggests that Agni is winning something on our behalf. Cf. also, in this
hymn, VI.16.28 agnír no vanate rayím “Agni will win us wealth.”
The root √van ‘win’ is strongly represented in this hymn, esp. in the middle
section. Here we have vanavase; elsewhere vanvánn ávātaḥ 20, vanván 26,
vanvántaḥ 27, vanate 28, as well as vivāsasi 12. This repetition cuts across tṛca
boundaries.</p>
<h3 id="vi1619">VI.16.19</h3>
<p>The “passive” aorist agāmi is a hapax and, in this context, a scrambling of
adjacent ā́gní(r).</p>
<h3 id="vi1620">VI.16.20</h3>
<p>The root √dāś ‘piously serve’ almost never takes an acc. object of the
service or offering (but see vs. 31 below); moreover, it almost exclusively has a
mortal subject and a god as recipient of the piety. Here, however, we have the
opposite situation: it is impossible to avoid taking Agni as subject and a very
concrete rayím as acc. object, with the implied recipients being us mortals. The clue
here may be the preverb, as áti √dāś in its other occurrence seems to mean
something like ‘out-pious the pious’: maghaír maghóno áti śūra dāśasi “With your
bounties you outdo the bounteous ones in piety, o champion [=Indra].” Although the
case frame is not exactly the same, the nuance is similar: human patrons are
bounteous, but Indra is super-bounteous. In our passage Agni provides wealth
“beyond all earthly (goods).” I previously thought that “earthly goods” were simply
those material things that have their origins on/in the earth rather than heaven, but it
may well be more pointed than that here: “goods that are given by those who stem
from/dwell on earth, that is, humans.” So Agni outdoes human givers by providing
wealth in excess of all the goods they can supply. On ‘goods’ as the appropriate noun
to supply with víśvā … pā́rthivā, cf. VI.45.20ab sá hí víśvāni pā́
rthivām̐, éko vásūni
pátyate as well as VI.59.9, IX.100.3, X.111.10.</p>
<h3 id="vi1622">VI.16.22</h3>
<p>Pāda a contains a 2nd plural enclitic prn. and a plural voc. (vaḥ sakhāyaḥ
“to/of you, o comrades”), while c has two 2nd singular imperatives (árca gā́ya). The
discrepancy in number must reflect the common situation of a poet’s mixing address
limited to himself with address to his colleagues and fellow ritual participants. So Ge
(n. 22), and see my 2009 “Poetic Self-Reference in the Rig Veda and the Persona of
Zarathustra,” BAI 19 (Fs. Skjaervø). Ge suggests without much enthusiasm that árca
73
gā́ya could be shortened 1st sg. subjunctives (*árcā *gā́yā), evidently responding to
Caland/Henry’s reading the verbs thus in their 1906 L’Agniṣṭoma, p. 428 (see Old,
who likewise rejects it). It’s worth noting that VI.45.4 has the same configuration but
with 2nd plural imperatives: sákhāyaḥ …, árcata prá ca gāyata “o comrades, chant
and sing forth …” This parallel is adduced by Bl (RR) ad V.52.4, where he calls our
verse “a scrappy stanza …modelled after existing patterns” (that is, VI.45.4). The
parallel is certain apposite, but I doubt that our number discrepancy is simply the
result of our poet jumbling together scraps drawn from different sources.</p>
<h3 id="vi1623">VI.16.23</h3>
<p>The injunc. sī́dat, in conjunction with the acc. of extent of time mā́nuṣā
yugā́“through the human lifetimes,” seems almost to have shed the literal sense of
the root √sad ‘sit’ in favor of expressing pure durativity (“who, through the human
lifetimes, has (always) been …”) &ndash; though the immediately following hótā evokes
the standard phrase for the installation of Agni as Hotar, with the full ‘sit’ clearly
present if metaphorically meant. as in VI.1.2 ádhā hótā ny àsīdaḥ … (“then you sat
down as Hotar”) in this Agni cycle. I rather imagine both senses are meant.</p>
<h3 id="vi1625">VI.16.25</h3>
<p>Given the proximity of ū́rj- ‘(solid) nourishment’ beginning c, iṣayaté in b
might better be rendered in a manner closer to íṣ- ‘refreshment’ in the same semantic
domain. So Ge “für die speisewünschenden Sterblichen,” Re “pour le mortel
cherchant la jouissance.” I might suggest an alternative “… for the mortal seeking
refreshment, / o child of nourishment.” What gives me pause, however, is iṣáyantaḥ
in vs. 27 in the same tṛca, where the ‘prosper’ sense is favored. Although our dat.
part. has accent on the ending, whereas iṣáyantaḥ has (secondary) “causative” accent,
in fact oblique forms of -áya-participles seem regularly to have desinential accent: cf.
mahayaté (VII.32.9) to maháyati, kṛpayatáḥ (VIII.46.16) to kṛpáyati. See disc. in my
1983 -áya-book, p. 49 with n. 3. Therefore these two nearby forms are likely to
belong to the same stem and invite the same tr.</p>
<h3 id="vi1626">VI.16.26</h3>
<p>The krátu- is presumably Agni’s; cf. vs. 23 kavíkratuḥ used of him. Ge tr.
krátvā as “Mit dem Gedanken,” and takes the interior pādas bc as the directly quoted
content of that thought. In addition to the aberrant tr. of krátu- (though one could tr.
“with the intention”), this seems unnecessary. Although, as Ge notes, krátvā in IV.1.1
does introduce such direct speech, it is marked there by íti, and the circumstances
there are different as well.</p>
<h3 id="vi1629">VI.16.29</h3>
<p>This vs. ushers in a set of forms of √bhṛ (also vss. 36, 40, 41, 47, 48).</p>
<h3 id="vi1630">VI.16.30</h3>
<p>Note the close sandhi effect in the voc. phrase brahmaṇas kave. As Ge
points out, this pāda is a variant of I.18.3 rákṣā ṇo brahmaṇas pate, with the more
usual head noun páti-. Because it is part of a voc. phrase and such phrases show
close sandhi effects elsewhere, this does not necessarily belong with the other
instances of irregular sandhi of -s before kaví-, on which see comm. ad VII.18.2,
though that may be a factor.
74</p>
<h3 id="vi1631">VI.16.31</h3>
<p>I do not know what the ā́ending the first pāda is doing. Sāy. takes it as
preverb with dā́śati, but this root doesn’t otherwise appear with ā́, and pāda-final
position is a strange place to put a preverb. There’s a pāda-final ā́also in 35a, but it
is easier to justify, as governing a locational acc.
I am disturbed by the usage of dā́śati here; for another problematic form to
this root, see disc. ad vs. 20 above. The example here describes not pious service but
a hostile act exactly contrary to the standard usages of the root. It also deviates from
the usual case frame (offer service to a god [DAT] with an offering vel sim. [INSTR]),
though a few passages match ours by expressing the offering in the ACC, e.g. I.93.3
… yá ā́hutiṃ, yó vāṃ dā́śād dhavíṣkṛtim “whoever will piously perform a poured
offering or the preparation of an oblation for you.” Assuming the reading is correct, I
think we must see this as a monstrous reversal: instead of piously offering an
oblation (ACC) to a god (DAT), the evil mortal is impiously offering us (ACC), as a sort
of oblation, to a weapon of death (DAT). The standard tr. (including mine) elide the
shock of the use of this verb of ritual service in such a context, by tr. √dāś differently
from usual. But I’m not sure how to remedy this in tr. without a lot of explanatory
baggage. Perhaps “who will ‘piously’ offer us …”?
Ge and Re take tásmāt … áṃhasaḥ as a single NP “from that áṃhas-,” but
this requires taking yáḥ in pāda a as an improper rel. for “when” (so Ge) or seeing
the relation between ab and c as an anacoluthon (so Re), because their interpr. of c
provides no referent for yáḥ … mártaḥ in the dependent cl. This can all be fixed by
separating the two abl. in the main clause, with tásmāt the correlative to yáḥ. Since
the immediately preceding vs. (30) has exactly the structure envisioned for our c
pāda &ndash; two parallel ablatives, one áṃhasaḥ and the other referring to a person &ndash;
there is very local precedent.</p>
<h3 id="vi1635">VI.16.35</h3>
<p>This vs. is syntactically incomplete (unless we take sī́dan in c as a
predicated pres. part., which seems unlikely, since this is a repeated pāda [=IX.32.4,
IX.64.11]), but it works well as adjunct to the previous vs., 34.
Pāda a shows the preoccupation with kinship that is characteristic of Agni
material. The paradox “father of his father” (pitúṣ pitā́[note close sandhi effect])
probably reflects two themes &ndash; 1) that the priest who kindles the fire is in some sense
his/its father, but Agni the god has a fatherly relationship to his mortal worshipers, 2)
that the offering fire (later called the Āhavanīya) is “taken out” of what is later called
the Gārhapatya and is therefore in some sense its son, but the offering fire is more
important than the other fires on the ritual ground and can therefore be considered
their father.
The meaning ‘syllable’ for akṣára- is quite stable in later Skt., but in the RV it
sometimes has its literal sense ‘imperishable’. Nonetheless in our passage I think
‘syllable’ is meant: the ritual fire is kindled when the hymn (here represented by the
syllable) is recited. So, more or less, Ge “bei der (heiligen) Rede (?) aufleuchtend”
(sim. Kü 250), though cf. Re “dans (l&rsquo;espace) inépuissable.”
75
The pāda-final ā́in c was mentioned above ad vs. 31, where it was pointed out
that the occurrence here in 35c can easily be accounted for. ā́frequently governs a
preceding acc. (see collection in Gr., col. 169), and in fact yónim ā́is found not only
in this pāda and its repetitions (see above), but also in similar pādas in IX.61.21,
65.19).</p>
<h3 id="vi1639">VI.16.39</h3>
<p>Unlike most -hán- cmpds, whose 1st member is the target of the smiting, in
śarya-hán- the 1st member śarya- ‘arrow’ must be in an instr. relationship with the
2nd (see Scar 693), like muṣṭi-hán ‘smiting with the fist(s)’. Because “like a powerful
shooter with arrows / one who shoots arrows” is exceptionally awk in English, I’ve
substituted ‘sharpshooter’, though it interferes with the tigmá- in tigmá-śṛṅga-
‘sharp-horned’ in the next pāda.</p>
<h3 id="vi3940">VI.39.40</h3>
<p>The simile marker ná is wrongly placed in pāda b, for no obvious reason.
The two comparanda to Agni &ndash; a bangle in the hand, a newborn babe, both
carried &ndash; suggest that this is the newly kindled fire, probably the offering fire, being
taken out of the householder’s fire and carried to the east.</p>
<h3 id="vi1641">VI.16.41</h3>
<p>This impression about vs. 40 is supported by vs. 41.</p>
<h3 id="vi1642">VI.16.42</h3>
<p>However, the waters are somewhat muddied by vs. 42. The loc. jātávedasi
(the only such form in the RV) is puzzling, since jātávedas- is one of the standard
epithets of Agni and the accusatives in the vs. clearly refer to Agni as well. Thus we
must be dealing with two fires. This idea would be perfectly compatible with the
scenario I suggested for vs. 40 &ndash; except that acc. gṛhapátim in pāda c suggests that
the newly born fire being “whetted” is not the offering fire (later to be called the
Āhavanīya) taken out of the old fire and moved to its new location, but rather what
will come to be called the Gārhapatya. The (later) ritual complex that our passage
most resembles is the creation of the Mahāvedi (see my Hyenas, p. 89, inter alia), in
which the old Āhavanīya of the standard ritual ground is moved further to the east
during the creation of the Mahāvedi, and the old Āhavanīya becomes the Gārhapatya.
Thus it seems that vss. 40–41 concern the further displacement of the Āhavanīya fire
and 42 depicts the resettlement of the original householder’s fire onto the place the
Āhavanīya occupied in the more restricted ritual ground. This may be Ge’s view; see
his n. 41ab, where he refers to the agnipraṇayana, which is the technical term for
carrying the Āhavanīya to the Uttaravedi in the animal sacrifice (see Sen, Dict. of
Vedic Rituals, s.v.; Caland-Henry, Agniṣṭoma pp. 78–79). However, his n. 42 goes in
a different direction. If this really does concern the creation of the Mahāvedi from
the ordinary ritual ground, we would have evidence for this degree of elaboration
already in (late) Rigvedic ritual.</p>
<h3 id="vi1643">VI.16.43</h3>
<p>The hí in the impv. clause is somewhat disturbing, since there is no
following impv. in this vs. to which the hí impv. clause could serve as basis.
However, 44a contains two impvs. that logically follow the yukṣvā́‘yoke!’ &ndash; namely
76
yāhi ā́vaha “drive and convey here!” and so the usual use of hí in impv. clauses can
be seen here, across two vss.</p>
<h3 id="vi1644">VI.16.44</h3>
<p>The very compressed pāda b could be elucidated with “… for (them=gods)
to pursue (them=offerings).” There are numerous parallels that establish this as the
intention.</p>
<h3 id="vi1647">VI.16.47</h3>
<p>Bloomfield (ad V.6.5) proposes tr. our passage “We bring &hellip; oblation with
song fashioned in the mind,” suggesting that “the cases of ṛcā́and havíḥ are inverted.”
This is certainly true at the level of deep-structure formula: hṛdā́taṣṭá- “fashioned by
the heart” normally modifies a verbal product, e.g. I.171.2 stómo hṛdā́taṣṭáḥ. But, as
so often, the poet is playing with our expections by producing a twist on the standard
phraseology.
VI.16.47–48: This long hymn (or the short final tṛca) seems to end with a buried
poetic signature: 47b ends with bharāmasi, 48c with vājínā, the last word of the
hymn. Together they are the elements that make up the poet’s name Bharadvāja.</p>
<h2 id="vi17-indra">VI.17 Indra</h2>
<p>This hymn is marked by clusters of localized repetitions and echoes; see disc.
below.
VI.17.1–3: These first three vss. form something of a unity. Each begins with a
“drink!” imperative (1a píbā sómam, 2a sá īm pāhi, 3a evā́pāhi), and each contains
the lexeme abhí √tṛd ‘drill through to’. As outlined below, it is a pleasingly designed
rhetorical structure, whose balance and contrast only become evident after conscious
analysis.</p>
<h3 id="vi171">VI.17.1</h3>
<p>Ge (flg Gr, fld. by Schmidt, B+I, 144) takes yám as obj. of abhí and
referring to sómam in the opening impv. phrase (“Drink the soma, towards which
…”). As Old points out (both ZDMG 55.319–20 and Noten), this entails either that
the soma is within the cow enclosure or at least that breaking into the cow enclosure
is a necessary auxiliary action for getting or preparing the soma &ndash; which is, of course,
not a standard part of the Vala myth. Old therefore emends the text, from yám to
*yáḥ, producing parallel rel. clauses concerning the Vala myth and the Vṛtra myth
respectively, with Indra the subject of both, represented by *yáḥ. But how would this
corruption arise? Old suggests that *yáḥ (*yá in this sandhi context) was changed to
yám because it immediately follows abhí, but it is hard to conceive of a Rigvedic
poet who could be misled by a separable preverb, esp. since the 2nd hemistich has a
supposedly parallel rel. cl. containing yáḥ, likewise following a preverb (ví). I agree
with Old that Ge’s interpr. is unlikely, but I do not think this requires changing the
text. Instead I think píbā sómam is an abrupt hortatory opening, essentially detached
from the rest of the vs., and I take the yám as referring to the ūrváṃ gávyam. This
whole clause anticipates the imperatival main clauses that end the next vss., 2d sá
77
indra citrā́m̐abhí tṛndhi vā́jān and 3d … abhí gā́indra tṛndhi, both with abhí √tṛd
and an obj. that refers to the contents of the cattle enclosure. My interpr. requires the
rel. cl. of 1ab to float in syntactic suspension till it is resolved in 2d, with a number of
other things going on in between &ndash; mostly rel. clauses with Indra as subject, but I do
not think this is much to ask of a Rigvedic audience. In fact, I think that the rel. cl. in
1ab is the initial marker of the ring structure that prevails in these three vss.
In d Ge suggests that vṛtrám is a “collective singular” and should be construed
with neut. pl. víśvā amitríyā, tr. “alle feindseligen Vṛtra’s.” I see no advantage to
ignoring the number, and the passages he adduces as parallel do not impose the
notion of “collective singular.”</p>
<h3 id="vi172">VI.17.2</h3>
<p>Again I think the “drink!” imperative is semi-detached from the rest of the
vs., a mere interruption of the sequence of rel. clauses with Indra as subj., which
begins with a fully realized clause in 1cd and continues in 2abc with a set of five
compressed definitional nominal clauses with an izafe-like feel.</p>
<h3 id="vi173">VI.17.3</h3>
<p>The “drink!” sequence is brought to an end with a summary evā́in 3a. The
verse continues with a series of 7 choppy imperatival clauses, all but the first
(mándatu tvā) with Indra as subj., which balance the choppy nominal relative clauses
of vs. 2. The last of these clauses is the third iteration of abhí √tṛd, with which we
began.
VI.17.3–5ab: mándatu tvā in 3a inaugurates a 3-vs. sequence chained together by the
root √ma(n)d ‘exhilarate’, a sequence whose 1st vs. (3) overlaps with the last vs. of
the initial triad. The other representatives also occur in the 1st pāda: mádāḥ in 4a and
mandasānáḥ in 5a. Cf. also matsarā́saḥ in 4d. The conceptual unity of the sequence
is underlined by the fact that 5ab is a rel. clause that must hang off the previous vs.
The 2nd hemistich of 5 marks a sharp break.</p>
<h3 id="vi176">VI.17.6</h3>
<p>This last vs. of the Vala section reprises ūrváṃ gávyam from 1b with ūrvā́d
gā́ḥ in 6b, both immediately pre-caesura, producing a ring. Thus, the supposedly
problematic rel. cl. of 1ab participates in two rings in this brief 6-vs. section, with
different parts of the clause in play in the two rings. See disc. ad vs. 1.
VI.17.7-10: An initial phonological sequence unifies this set of vss.: from the 2nd half
of 7 through the 1st half of 10 every hemistich begins with ádh (or the variants ád
and áh): 7c ádhā(rayo), 8a ádha, 8c ád(eva), 9a ádha, 9c áh(im), 10a ádha.</p>
<h3 id="vi177">VI.17.7</h3>
<p>Both Old (ZDMG 55.320 and Noten) and Ge (fld. by Klein DGRV II.92–
93) strongly argue that paprā́tha belongs to √prath ‘spread’, not √prā ‘fill’, to which
Gr assigns it. I find their insistence puzzling. On their side, ví √prath is a fairly
common lexeme, used often of the earth, whereas ví is rare to non-existent with √prā.
But the actual verb form is wrong for all sorts of reasons. First, the indic. pf. of
√prath is otherwise only middle, but this would be act. Second, the root √prath
78
never otherwise has vṛddhi forms, but the root syllable here is prāth. Then, if it is a
3rd sg. (so Ge “Er breitete …”), it opens a cosmogonic sequence of 2nd sg. expressions,
and such formulaic cosmogonies tend to be consistent in ps. and no. (though see 9cd
below). Recognizing this last problem, Old suggests it’s a 2nd sg., standing for
*paprath-tha &gt; *paprattha, with the heavy syllable *atth redistributing metrical
weight [not his terminology] to āth. This type of change would not be unusual in
Middle Indic, but it would have been useful to provide parallel examples in Rig Veda.
Moreover, since √prath is a seṭ root, we should in any case expect a 2nd sg.
*paprathitha. The only factor on their side of the ledger is the preverb, and since our
poet no doubt playfully recognized that the form would evoke √prath, it is not
surprising that he would import the preverb. Unambiguous perfect forms to √prā ‘fill’
frequently take the earth as obj. as here (e.g., III.30.11 índra ā́paprau pṛthivīm utá
dyā́m), which makes the Old/Ge intransigence all the more surprising.
In pāda a máhi dáṃsaḥ interrupts the obj. phrase kṣā́m … urvī́m. Ge’s
nominal phrase “— ein grosses Meisterstück—” is less disruptive than my nominal
clause “great is your wondrous skill,” and might be preferable on those grounds.</p>
<h3 id="vi178">VI.17.8</h3>
<p>As Ge points out, the non-god (ádeva-) is presumably Vṛtra. This
identification is clinched by the fact that the verb here, aúhiṣṭa ‘vaunted himself’
(√uh/oh), reappears in the (pseudo-)participle óhasāna- modifying áhi- ‘serpent’ in
the next vs. (9c).
In d the pres. vṛṇate is a bit surprising in this mythological narrative.</p>
<h3 id="vi179">VI.17.9</h3>
<p>The word and particle order of the 1st hemistich seems designed to produce
despair in those of us who seek (and believe in) principles and rules for such
ordering: ádha dyaúś cit te ápa sā́nú vájrād, dvitā́namat … seems randomly to
scatter nouns, pronouns, and particles through the first pāda. However, I think that
my interpr. of the first pāda imposes more rationality on the sequence than Ge’s does
and also eliminates at least one further problem. Note first the preverb ápa in the
middle of the 1st pāda, though preverbs in tmesis (as this is, from anamat in b)
usually move to metrical boundaries. [It is true that it appears directly after the
caesura, but generally a preverb in tmesis takes this position only when the verb is in
the same pāda, or such is my impression.] Note, moreover, the apparent doubling of
the subject dyaúḥ with the pronoun sā́likewise in the middle of the same pāda,
directly after the preverb. Note finally that after a beginning that seems to conform
fairly well to Rigvedic word-order norms (extraclausal introductory ádha,
noun+emphatic ptcl dyaúś cid, enclitic prn. in modified 2nd position te), the clause
seems to begin over again: preverb ápa, prn. sā́(curiously, fem. sā́seems more
inclined to 2nd position than masc. sá), modified 2nd pos. ptcl. nú. Ge’s tr. simply
ignores this stuttering start (“Da wich selbst der Himmel von deiner Keule ..”), and
he also doesn’t comment on the fact that his interpr. implicitly requires dyaúḥ to be
picked up by a fem. prn.: Gr lists this passage as one where that noun has fem.
gender. Although ‘heaven’ sometimes does seem to be fem., such passages are rarer
79
than Gr makes out, and this example would be esp. striking because there’s no reason
for dyaúḥ to be doubled by a pronoun in the first place, whatever its gender.
I think both problems can be solved by assuming that sā́actually adds a
second referent to the clause; in context with ‘heaven’ this would obviously be the
fem. ‘earth’ (generally pṛthivī́-, but perhaps here, because of their joint presence in
7ab, kṣā́-). No Rigvedic audience would need further specification, once the feminine
gender of the referent was established. By this interpr. the post-caesura sequence ápa
sā́nú … is not an awkward redo of the 1st half of the pāda, but introduces a parallel
subject to dyaúḥ, more clearly distinguished from ‘heaven’ than in the usual dual
dvandva formulation. The separation of the two subjects is, in my opinion, signalled
by dvitā́‘yet again’ beginning the next pāda; I render it here as “likewise also.” The
parallels adduced by Ge (IV.17.2, I.80.11, II.12.13, V.32.9) actually support my
interpr. because all four of them depict both heaven and earth (or in the case of the
last, the two world-halves) trembling in fear of Indra.
Alternatively, MLW suggests (p.c.) that dyaúḥ could have fem. gender here
because of its unmanly behavior in flinchig away from Indra’s weapon. Restarting
with sā́would emphatically draw attention to this gender switch: “Then even Heaven,
really a she …” This is clever, but I still prefer my own solution.
Flg. Ge (“… dass er für alle Zeit erlag”), I take śayáthe here as a quasiinfinitive expressing purpose with jaghā́na; in this function it seems directly parallel
to śayáthāya in the next hymn (VI.18.8), to the same stem. Unfortunately they must
then be in different cases, the dative, understandably, in VI.18.8, the loc., less
understandably, here. However much I would like to, I cannot find a way to make
our śayáthe a dative, there being no athematic stem *śayáth-. We could, of course,
interpr. the locative as a real expression of location: “struck down the serpent in his
lair,” but not only am I reluctant to lose the semantic connection with VI.18.8, but
the acc. extent of time viśvā́yuḥ ‘for a full lifespan’ only makes sense with the verbal
interpr. of śayáthe ‘to lie’.
Despite Gr and Lub, a number of viśvā́yuḥ forms, which they assign to the
stem viśvā́yu- and therefore interpr. as nom. sg. masc., must have the 2nd member
ā́yus- and therefore be nom./acc. sg. neut., often used as an adverbial indication of
extent of time as here (so Ge’s tr. as well; see above). See AiG II.2.479. I concede
that it would be possible to take the form as a nom. here — “when Indra, having a
full lifespan, struck down the serpent …” — with Indra’s full lifespan implicitly
contrasting with Vṛtra’s death, but I find the extent-of-time adverbial more
compelling. And in a passage like I.68.5 viśvā́yur víśve ápāṃsi cakruḥ “all have
performed their tasks lifelong,” the plural subject rules out a nom. sg. interpr. for
viśvā́yuḥ. Although the stem viśvā́yu- certainly exists, it has a doublet with final -s-,
exactly like the simplex pair ā́yu-/ ā́yus-.
Assuming the correctness of the above disc. of viśvā́yuḥ, Vṛtra’s fate, “to lie
there for a full lifespan,” is somewhat ironic, since he’s dead: he will spend his full
lifespan dead.

<h3 id="vi1710">VI.17.10</h3>
<p>With Old I assume an underlying mahé, contra Pp. maháḥ, despite Ge’s
doubts (n. 10b).
The morphological identity of vavṛtat isn’t at all clear. Gr calls it a “Conj.”
aor.; Whitney seems to suggest a subj. to a redupl. pres. Lub identifies it as a
“[RED.AOR.inj.(them.)].” A pf. subj. makes the most formal sense, save for the zerograde root syllable, but a subjunctive would be out of place in this mythological
passage. Kü (460) treats our form as a “Sonderfall” and calls it a thematic injunctive,
expressing an action prior to that of the verb sáṃ piṇak in d. Since, in his view, this
same anterior value is expressed by the impf. of the caus. (ávartayat in I.85.9), he
calls our form an “Oppositionsbildung zum Kausativ,” whatever that means, but
ultimately gives up on determining its morphological identity. I agree that the form
cannot functionally be a subjunctive and am willing to accept that it is a nonce
injunctive &ndash; but this is a description, not an explanation. Note the pf. opt. vavṛtyāt in
13d, whose redupl. profile vavṛt- matches that of this form.
As for what the clause expresses, I assume that Tvaṣṭar is manufacturing the
vájra- by turning it on a lathe or lathe-like device. (The internet tells me that the lathe
dates back to antiquity, with good evidence from ancient Egypt, but it is difficult to
know how much to trust this.) Alternatively, but less likely in my view, Tvaṣṭar is
displaying it to Indra by turning it here and there to allow its spikes and edges to glint
in the light.
The other verb form in this vs., sám piṇak in d, also presents difficulties,
because, despite being in a relative cl., it is unaccented. I have no explanation for the
failure to accent (nor does Old, I’d point out). Of course, one can note the unusual
position of the rel. prn. yéna, at the end of pāda c as the first word of the subord.
clause that otherwise occupies d, with the rel. prn. intervening between the acc. sg.
masc. phrase níkāmam arámanasam that modifies the vájram of the main cl. and the
acc. sg. masc. phrase návantam áhim that provides the object of the rel. cl. But
Rigvedic poets are unlikely to be thrown by this positioning. It is also noteworthy
that pāda c as it stands has only 10 syllables; Old suggests that we might read iéna to
round out the Triṣṭubh, which would be unprecedented in the rel. prn., as far as I
know. Pāda c is also unusual in having 5 light syllables in a row: (níkā)mam
arámana(saṃ yéna), and indeed, were we to read i
y
éna, this would rise to 7. Since
arámanasa- is a hapax and it participates in a metrically disturbed sequence, it may
be that the pāda is somehow corrupt. But no way of fixing any of this comes to mind.

In the 2nd hemistich we have only two expressed subjects, Pūṣan and Viṣṇu,
but a plural verb dhāvan. The obvious solution, as seen by all, is to assume that other
gods participated in this action.
The question is &ndash; what action? The verb is generally assigned to √dhāv ‘run’.
Gr gives a transitive-causative value to this stem in this passage and this passage
alone (Gr “jemandem [D.] etwas [A.] zuströmen”); Ge follows this trans. interpr.:
81
“… liessen für ihn den … (Soma)stengel … strömen,” and indeed interprets another
passage as having this value (IX.54.2). However, since all other acc. with √dhāv are
goals to an intrans. verb of motion, this contextual adjustment is unacceptable. Gotō
(1st Klasse, 183 and n. 325) disputes both of Ge’s trans. interpretations and fixes this
passage by dividing the two pādas into two clauses. The first has an acc. goal sárāṃsi
(“…eilen zu den drei [Soma]seen”), which seems reasonable (indeed cf. IX.54.2
ayáṃ sárāṃsi dhāvati), but he must supply a verb (‘gave’) out of thin air to make
pāda d to work: “[sie geben] ihm den Vrtrat ̥ ötenden, berauschenden Somastengel.”
The problem can be solved by assigning the verb to the other root √dhāv ‘rinse’, part
of the standard vocabulary of soma preparation. VIII.2.25 (ā́dhāvata … sómaṃ
vīrā́ya) presents an exactly parallel construction with soma as acc. obj. and the
recipient, Indra, in the dat. Moreover, ‘rinse’ would add a complementary foodpreparation term to √pac ‘cook’ in pāda b, with both solid and liquid nourishment
thus covered, whereas ‘run’ is a bit of a non sequitur. The only thing that gives me
pause is X.113.2 tám asya víṣṇur mahimā́nam ójasā, aṃśúṃ dadhanvā́n …, where we
have Viṣṇu, the aṃśú, and an undoubted &lsquo;run’ (to the separate root √dhan[v]). But
this late passage does not seem to me sufficient to outweigh the fact that a ‘rinse’
interpr. here allows the hemistich to be a single syntactic unit and forestalls the need
to supply a verb for d out of nowhere.</p>
<h3 id="vi1712">VI.17.12</h3>
<p>In d apásaḥ ‘busy, industrious’ (Ge’s fleissig) is, of course, a pun on the
‘water’ word, whose acc. pl. is apás.</p>
<h3 id="vi1714">VI.17.14</h3>
<p>I take the construction √dhā ACC [anim.] ACC.ADJ -mant-/vant- to mean
“provide someone (X) with something (Y),” lit. “establish X as possessing (-mant-
/vant-) Y.” The datives of ab are then further objects to aspire to: once the poets have
brilliance, they can use that brilliance, which transforms into poems, in pursuit of
more worldly goals, the prize, etc. This interpr. essentially follows Ge’s.</p>
<h2 id="vi18-indra">VI.18 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="vi181">VI.18.1</h3>
<p>This vs. contains two pairs of positive/negative etymological figures, both
consisting of a pres. participle with “active” value (though one of them is
morphologically middle) and a negated past part.: vanvánn ávātaḥ “vanquishing but
unvanquished” and áṣāḷham … sáhamānam “conquering but unconquered.” It may
not be an accident that the root syllables in each pair, though related by standard
derivational processes, are quite distinct because of morphophonemic changes: van /
vā and sah / ṣāḷh.</p>
<h3 id="vi182">VI.18.2</h3>
<p>On unclear khaja- see comm. ad VII.20.3.</p>
<h3 id="vi183">VI.18.3</h3>
<p>The sequence 2ND SG. PRN ha tyád (here ha nú tyád) is fairly common and
appears to be strongly emphatic, hence my tr. “it was just you” (etc.). In several
hymns (I.63.4–7, VIII.96.16–18) this construction is found in series.
82
I take the fronted ásti followed by svid to be a strong existential “does it exist?”
rather than simply the possessive constr. that Ge sees: “Hast du … diese
Manneskrafte …?”</p>
<h3 id="vi184">VI.18.4</h3>
<p>The fronted ásti in the previous vs. is matched by equally emphatic, fronted
sád íd. Although Ge takes sát as the modifier of the sáhaḥ that begins the next pāda, I
think instead that it answers the question posed in 3cd and therefore implicitly
modifies vīryàm in 3c. This is then further specified as sáhaḥ beginning in b, which
then is qualified by the adjectives ugrám and távīyaḥ in c.
The last three pādas of the vs. are a veritable riot of etymological figures, with
two each in b and c and one in d: b sáhaḥ sahiṣṭha turatás turásya, c ugrám ugrásya
tavásas távīyaḥ, d áradhrasya radhratúraḥ … The 2nd member of this last cmpd, -tur-,
belongs etymologically with the 2nd figure of b, turatás turásya, though unfortunately
since it’s used in a somewhat different sense, this connection cannot easily be
conveyed in translation. Similarly, the 2nd figure of c, tavásas távīyaḥ, picks up the
tuvi- of the cmpd in a, tuvi-jātá-. So, in addition to the juxtaposed linear figures,
there is some interweaving across pāda boundaries.</p>
<h3 id="vi185">VI.18.5</h3>
<p>As the opening words of pāda b, itthā́vádadbhiḥ, indicate, the previous pāda
is the direct speech of the Aṅgirases. In keeping with the two immediately preceding
vss., I take astu as an existential: “let that partnership (still) exist.” The wording is
otherwise very like IV.10.8 śivā́naḥ sakhyā́sántu &hellip; devéṣu yuṣmé. The clear loc.
devéṣu in that passage anchors the loc. identity of yuṣmé both in that passage and this
one. The loc. is somewhat odd: generally sakhyá- is construed with gen. or instr., as
already set forth by Gr s.v. However, cf. VII.22.9 (=X.23.7), which also contains a pl.
ps. prn. in -e: asmé te santu sakhyā́śivā́ni. In the publ. tr. I take the asmé there as a
dat.: “Let there be friendly fellowship of you for us.” But in light of the two parallel
structures with yuṣmé, I think it must be a loc., and these three passages, each of
which is rendered differently in the publ. tr., should be harmonized. I now think that
all three are existential (although the two with śivá- could be equational, with a pred.
adj.) and that the loc. specifies the locus of the partnership, either in or “bei” the
pronominal referent. Though this is functionally equivalent to “with,” as in the publ.
tr., I would slightly modify the tr. to better reflect the loc.: “Let there (still) be ageold partnership for us among you,” though “… with you” would in fact be clearer.
The placement of valám in the middle of the instr. phrase in b, with its
governing verb (hán) not found till c, is somewhat odd, but see comm. ad vs. 8 below.
Presumably the Vala cave is “prospering” because it is full of cows. On the
accent of iṣáyantam here, see my -áya-Formations, p. 49 and n. 3.
The positive active / negative passive figure found twice in vs. 1 is here
embodied in the single word, the root-noun cmpd voc. acyuta-cyut- ‘shaker of the
unshakable’.</p>
<h3 id="vi186">VI.18.6</h3>
<p>The vs. contains 3 coreferential sá, at the beg. of a and of c and in the
middle of c. I have interpr. the first half of c as belonging with ab, with the loc.
83
tokásātā tánaye parallel to loc. mahatí vṛtratū́rye in b and the mid-pāda sá in c
introducing a new cl. Others (Ge, Schaef., Intens. 126) take all of c with d. There is
no way to determine and very little riding on it. However, see the comm. on the next
vs.
The hí in pāda a seems to have little or no causal value; similarly the one in 4a.
Although the overt ásti reminds us of the other overt forms of √as in previous
vss. (3, 4, 5), which were (at least by my lights) existential, ásti here seems to be a
straight copula and therefore pleonastic.
In tokásātā tánaye we can assume that tánaye shows a kind of gapping of the
2nd cmpd member found in toká-sāti-, hence a putative *tánaya-sāti-. Ge’s cited
parallels, e.g., II.30.5 tokásya sātaú tánayasya …, confirm this.</p>
<h3 id="vi187">VI.18.7</h3>
<p>This vs. continues the overabundance of sá from the last vs., esp. in the 2nd
hemistich, with initial sá and post-caesura sá in c and initial sá in d, in addition to the
one opening the vs. Each of these sá is associated with a different instr. phrase or
phrases. The one in the first hemistich has the capacious bipartite majmánā …
ámartyena nā́mnā embedded in a full clause with the verb prá sarsre; the two in pāda
c occur only with instrumentals (dyumnéna in the opening and the conjoined
śávasotá rāyā́after the caesura); the one in d has only a single instr. (vīryèṇa) but is
part of a clause again, though with a pred. adj. sámokaḥ, not a finite verb. Since the
structure of this vs. is like that of vs. 6, the question again arises as to where to attach
c (or the two parts of c). Flg. Ge I take all of c with d, construing all the
instrumentals with sámokaḥ ‘at home (with)’. But I now see that, because the
structures in c are minimal, it could as well go with ab (or the first half with ab, the
second with d). This would produce alternative translations “Through his greatness
and his immortal name he extended himself, (and also) through his brilliance and his
power and wealth. He is at home with heroism.” or even “Through his greatness and
his immortal name he extended himself, (and also) through his brilliance; he is at
home with power and wealth and with heroism.” (This last, with the first part of c
leaning backward and the 2nd leaning forward, would mimic my interpr. of vs. 6.)
Again I do not see a way to decide the question, but I think it’s worth noting how the
poet has cleverly constructed pāda c so that it is ambig.</p>
<h3 id="vi188">VI.18.8</h3>
<p>As Ge points out (n. 8b), the role of Cumuri and Dhuni in the RV is to be
put to sleep by Indra, so that Dabhīti can deliver the coup de grâce to them. See the
various passages adduced by Ge and esp. nearby VI.26.6. In our vs. they are
marooned at the end of the first hemistich, and after an initial verb in c another set of
Indra’s victims is introduced: Pipru, Śambara, and Śuṣṇa. Ge asks whether we should
assume an ellipsis with Cumuri/Dhuni phrase (in other words, supply a form of “put
to sleep”) or a zeugma (in other words, to take them as objects of vṛṇák with the
Pipru group, though their fates were met in different ways). I have chosen the 2nd
option. The audience would certainly know the particular destiny of Cumuri and
Dhuni but would also be able to lump them in with other targets of Indra, all as
objects of a generically violent verb. (It may be worth noting that vṛnák here is one
84
of the very few forms of √vṛj that lacks a preverb, though cf. nearby VI.26.3.) The
segregation of Cumuri and Dhuni in pāda b, away from the verb and the other
victims, might give us pause, but cf. vs. 5, where the obj. valám is found in the
interior of pāda b, with the verb beginning c.
In d the datives cyautnā́ya and śayáthāya have parallel infinitival function.
For the latter cf. also śayáthe in the preceding hymn (VI.17.9, with disc. ad loc.) with
the same apparent meaning but in a different case.</p>
<h3 id="vi189">VI.18.9</h3>
<p>udā́vatā is read udávatā by the Pp. and is generally considered the instr. of
the pres. act. part. of úd √av ‘help’, with metrical lengthening (so explicitly Lub), a
lengthening that is unmotivated. It is also the case that úd is not especially common
with √av, though I concede that the six passages I’m aware of make this an
established usage. I also find it surprising that there is no preverb with tiṣṭha in the
expression in b, rátham … tiṣṭha “mount the chariot,” since this expression is almost
always found with preverb, generally ā́, also ádhi. I therefore wonder if the initial
string in pāda a is actually concealing the preverb(s), in tmesis: ud-ā́, followed by the
uncompounded pres. part. ávatā. This analysis is responsible for my tr. “up and
mount …” I realize, however, that a number of objections can be raised. The
combination ud-ā́doesn’t otherwise occur with √sthā, but I would point out that both
occur with that root individually. Two further potential problems: 1) two preverbs
next to each other in tmesis, rather than the usual single one. I confess I do not know
of other examples. 2) the accentuation: the accented vowels of ā́and ávatā would
coalesce, resulting in a single udātta &ndash; this is unproblematic &ndash; but the lack of accent
on ud looms larger. Here I rely on Macdonell’s observation (VGS, p. 469) that when
ā́is immediately preceded by another preverb, ā́alone has the accent. In Macdonell’s
formulation this applies (only) to these sequences when compounded with verbs; I
would here extend that to the same sequence in tmesis. This may be too much
machinery to deploy simply in order to account for the surprising, supposed metrical
lengthening of udā́vatā and the surprising lack of preverb with tiṣṭha, but it seems
worth considering. Alternatively, it could be that udā́vatā is a cmpded pres. part., but
cmpded not only with úd, but also ā́. This is the solution of Rivelex (I.541), and it
may be the best compromise, though ā́is not otherwise found with √av, as far as I
know. (I have not been able to find the ā́+√av claimed by Rivelex in the head note
on p. 538, and in the claimed prá ā́passage (VIII.23.2), ā́is a postposition, as is more
or less admitted p. 543 n. 1.)
The ca in the instr. phrase in pāda a seems pleonastic, and if it is implicitly
connecting the two adj. modifying tvákṣasā, viz. ávatā (or udā́vatā) and pányasā
(Klein DGRV I.71 “aiding and wondrous”), they seem ill-assorted semantically. I
wonder if it is meant to connect the first ADJ.-NOUN pair with a 2nd, with gapping of
the noun modified by pányasā (“with your helpful energy and ever more admirable
X”). But there is no standard pányas- NOUN formula, so I will not pursue this.
In d Old (Noten) and Ge assume that the māyā́ḥ are negative magical wiles
that belong to Indra’s opponents. A negative valuation of māyā́- is of course common,
and is clear in the nearby passage VI.22.9, where a pāda almost identical to our c,
85
urging Indra to take his mace in hand, precedes one in which he is urged to destroy
māyā́ḥ (VI.22.9cd dhiṣvá vájraṃ dákṣiṇa indra háste, víśvā ajurya dayase ví māyā́ḥ) -</p>
<ul>
<li>though see comm. ad loc: a secondary positive reading is also possible. This
parallel is an important piece of evidence for both Old’s and Ge’s assessment of
māyā́ḥ here. However, this reasonable interpr. ignores one major factor in our
passage: the verb abhí prá manda. This lexeme occurs a number of times elsewhere
(V.4.1, VII.33.1, VIII.12.13, 93.19), and it is always otherwise positive: act.
‘exhilarate’, mid. ‘become exhilarated’. A negative interpr. of māyā́ḥ requires a
serious distortion of the meaning of the verb (e.g., Old’s ‘verwirren’, adopted from
BR), whereas assuming the māyā́ḥ belong to Indra allows it to have a small extension
of its usual sense: ‘exhilarate’ à ‘stimulate’. Just as soma exhilarates and stimulates
Indra for the Vṛtra-smashing, so does Indra exhilarate and stimulate his own powers.
Old in fact previously (ZDMG 55.323) made a good case that the māyā́ḥ are Indra’s,
third in a list of his Kampfmittel that includes the chariot of b and the mace of c, and
he suggested a tr. “Setze deine Wunderkräfte in freudige Erregung” very much like
mine. He attributes his change of heart in the Noten to VI.22.9 just cited and to his
consideration of “Der Gesamteindruck des Auftretens von māyā́ḥ in den
Indraliedern.” But, in fact, he overlooked one very crucial occurrence, in this very
hymn: in vs. 12 Indra himself is called purumāyá- ‘having many magical powers’ (cf.
also nearby VI.21.2 and 22.1 in this same Indra cycle, also III.51.4). This seems to
me clinching evidence against the Ge/Old interpr. of our d: Indra has many māyā́-
and he deploys them to achieve his ends. (Gotō [1st Kl., 236 n. 521] finds the passage
puzzling, but does try to reconcile it with the usage of the verb, not entirely
successfully.)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vi1810">VI.18.10</h3>
<p>The imagery is somewhat mixed here: it is hard to see how either a missile
(nom. aśániḥ) or a lance (instr. hetī́[contra Pp. hetíḥ, as seen already by Gr etc.]) can
burn down anything. I assume it’s a transferred visual image from the fire simile,
since flames can have a lance-like shape and shoot out dramatically.
The fem. instr. adj. phrase gambhīráya ṛṣváyā lacks an overt referent. Ge
supplies Stimme without disc. In the absence of any obvious choices, I follow Gr in
assuming hetī́from pāda b. Neither ṛṣvá- nor gambhīrá- has a standard fem. referent.
The obj. of rurója is likewise unexpressed. Ge supplies Burgen (púraḥ, a
common obj. of this verb), but (n. 10cd) suggests that rákṣaḥ from b is also possible.
Since the yó rurója rel. clause of c is picked up by the main cl. of d, I instead supply
duritā́, which is the obj. of the conjoined verbs of d. Elsewhere duritā́is the obj. of
√han (IX.62.2, 90.6, 97.16), a verb semantically similar to √ruj.</p>
<h3 id="vi1811">VI.18.11</h3>
<p>Gr takes the referent of yásya as ‘wealth’ (see col. 1114, s.v. yótu-). But it
is far more likely that it is Indra, whom we are urging to come here &ndash; and whose
arrival might be threatened by the actions of the ungodly man. (It is not possible to
determine from Ge’s tr. (“den”) what he thinks the referent is.) The relationship
between yāhí and yótoḥ might be clearer if the rel. clause were tr. “… never has the
power to keep away.”
86
On yótoḥ see now also Keydana (Inf., 77–78), who does not consider it a true
infinitive. He takes yásya simply as the determiner of a gen. action noun yótu-. I am
more inclined to see yótuḥ as an infinitive, and therefore consider yásya as an
example of “attraction” to the case of the infinitive from an underlying obj. *yám.
The dative to the same stem does function as an infinitive and takes acc. rection:
VIII.71.15 agním dvéṣo yótavai no gṛṇīmasi (cf. VIII.18.5 dvéṣāṃsi yótave).</p>
<h3 id="vi1813">VI.18.13</h3>
<p>This vs. is structurally reminiscent of vs. 8. Like there, we have a clause
occupying the first pāda (both ending in bhū́t/bhūt, as it happens), with (most of) b
belonging to a different but radically incomplete clause, containing a marooned set of
accusative PNs whose fate at the hands of Indra is well known. Pāda c continues with
other accusative victims of Indra, but also provides a verb to govern them. In both
vss. the names in the b clause have a well-known and quite specific outcome at
Indra’s hands: Cumuri and Dhuni in 8b were put to sleep by Indra, to weaken them
for a death blow administered by someone else; as for our vs., acdg. to I.53.10 Indra
made Kutsa, Āyu, and Atithigva subject (arandhanāyaḥ) to Tūrvayāṇa, who also
appears by name in our pāda d. In both 8b and 13b the publ. tr. follows the same
strategy: co-opting the verb in c (vṛṇák in 8, ní śiśāḥ in 13) to govern not only the
accusatives in its own pāda but also those in pāda b. This is syntactically a bit more
complex in our vs. because b is a relative clause (with yád) so the unaccented verb of
c cannot be applied to it directly. I still think this is the correct strategy in 8 and
probably also here as well, but the presence of dat. asmai in b along with its likely
referent tū́rvayāṇam in d makes me wonder if Ge (n. 13b) may be right in simply
supplying the verb found in the very phrase in I.53.10 tvám asmai kútsam atithigvám
āyúm, … arandhanāyaḥ, despite the isolation of that passage and its distance from
ours. (Alternatively we could use árdayaḥ, which governs the same three names in
VIII.53.2, but there is no dat. there; and it is likewise isolated and distant.) Old (both
ZDMG 55.323 and Noten) is also in favor of supplying such a verb. Note in passing
that unaccented asyai in our b presupposes a referent already in the discourse, so it
must be anticipating tū́rvayāṇam in d. For Tūrvayāṇa cf. the simile tū́rvan ná yā́man
in nearby VI.15.5 with disc. ad loc.</p>
<h3 id="vi1814">VI.18.14</h3>
<p>The aor. subjunctive káraḥ is generally taken as preterital, an interpr.
licensed by Gr, who identifies it as “Impf.” But this is morphologically irresponsible,
and further, given the injunc. mádan in the main cl. (b), a proper subj. value is quite
possible. I think this is an example of the standard rhetorical move to take Indra’s
signal mythological deeds and make them a model for his behavior in the future, to
our benefit. The next and final vs. continues this point of view. See Hoff (Injunk. 55
and n. 37) for a similar assessment, though he also envisions the possibility of
“Konjunktiv im präteritalen Sachverhalt.”</p>
<h2 id="vi19-indra">VI.19 Indra</h2>
<p>This hymn is something of a bricolage, with numerous phrases, pādas, and
whole verses borrowed from elsewhere. (I say “borrowed” rather than the more
87
neutral “parallel to,” because the sheer number of the matches strongly suggests that
there is a magpie quality to the construction of this hymn. For details of the matches,

Gr derives aminá- from √am (‘mächtig andringend, gewaltig’), but it must
belong to √mī as thematic parallel to áminant-. See Old (ZDMG 55.323).
The phrase in d, súkṛtaḥ kartṛ́bhir bhūt “he was well made by his makers,” is
somewhat startling as a description of the great god Indra. Who are his makers? Is
this a depiction of his original creation, or does it have a more narrow and current
application? Because of the previous pāda, … vāvṛdhe vīryā̀ya “he has been
strengthened for his heroic deed,” I am inclined towards the latter: the soma drinks
and ritual activities and praise have made him the consummate heroic actor. The pl.
agent noun kartár- may refer to the soma drinks or to the priests who prepared and
offered them to Indra. Because I think the reference is to the immediate past, I would
slightly alter the tr. from “was well made” to “has been well made.”
VI.19.1–2: These two vss. show a penchant for synonymous pairs: 1d urúḥ pṛthúḥ
“wide (and) broad,” 2b bṛhántam ṛṣvám “lofty (and) towering,” ajáraṃ yúvānam
“unaging (and) youthful.”</p>
<h3 id="vi192">VI.19.2</h3>
<p>śávasā śūśuvā́ṃsam “swollen with strength” is an etymological figure,
though śávas- has lost its tight connection to √śū ‘swell’. Both words are reused in

<h3 id="vi194">VI.19.4</h3>
<p>Since śāká-, so accented, is the adj. ‘able’, not a noun śā́ka- ability’, I

With pāda d I supply opt. syāma. Cf. II.27.7 úpa syāma puruvī́rā áriṣṭāḥ, sim.

<p>The gen. phrase vāmásya vásunaḥ in b is difficult to construe. Ge supplies
“(Spender)” as its head noun; my tr. assumes that it is a loose genitive specification
of the paśú- that is lurking in the -kṣú- in the bahuvrīhi puru-kṣú- ‘possessing much
livestock’. This interpr. is suggested by the other occurrence of this gen. phrase in
VIII.1.31 utá vāmásya vásunaś ciketati, yó ásti yā́dvaḥ paśúḥ “of the valuable goods
what will stand out is the livestock coming from Yadu,” where the vāmá- vásu- is
identified as a particular paśú-. But the syntax proposed for our passage is sketchy.
By accent rā́yaḥ should be nom. pl., not, as I have tr. it, gen. sg. As Ge
suggests in his n. 5c, it reads literally “the paths, the riches …” Nonetheless, Old
(ZDMG 55.324 and Noten) considers the nom. pl. reading “forced” (gezwungen) and
interprets it as a gen. sg. (on the basis in part of VII.18.3 pathyā̀rāyáḥ with a clear
88
gen. sg.). In the ZDMG treatment he explicitly says that emending the accent isn’t
necessary, though he doesn’t indicate why.
In d Ge suggests a haplology of *samudréṇa ná, with an instr. rather than a
loc., as in III.36.7 samudréṇa síndhavo yā́damānāḥ, where he proposes a similar
haplology. This is possible, but not nec.: I see no reason why rivers can’t unite in the
sea as well as with it. As for III.36.7 see comm. ad loc.; I do not think that a simile
particle is necessary there.
VI.19.6–8: As noted in the publ. intro., all three of these vss. contain the phrase
“bring here to us”: in 6a and 7b na ā́bhara straddles the early caesura; in 8a ā́no
bhara opens the vs. Since vss. 6–8 are the middle vss. of this hymn, this repeated
phrase might identify an omphalos, but if so it is quite a weak one. The vss. are not
particular noteworthy for their content, and the enclosing vss. do not provide the
usual frame structure.</p>
<h3 id="vi196">VI.19.6</h3>
<p>The first hemistich is notable for the superlative etymological figures:
double śáviṣṭham … śávaḥ “strongest strength” (or, in fact, triple, since śūra ‘hero’ is
ultimately related to these words) and triple ójiṣṭham ójaḥ … ugrám “mightiest
mighty might.” The triple etym. connection of the first phrase is better conveyed by
Ge’s “Bring uns, du Starker, die stärkste Stärke” than by the publ. tr. Note also that
the adjacent words in b ójo abhibhūta “… might, o overpowering one,” though not
syntactically connected here, form a bahuvrīhi modifying Indra in the preceding
hymn, VI.18.1 abhíbhūti-ojas- ‘of overpowering strength’.
VI.19.7–8: I tr. śūśuvā́ṃsam in both vss. as ‘swollen with strength’, although the
śávasā found in 2c is absent, as a portmanteau tr. to capture the full sense of the root.
This participle picks up śáviṣṭham … śávaḥ in vs. 6.</p>
<h3 id="vi197">VI.19.7</h3>
<p>On the long root vowel in jigīvā́ṃsaḥ, see Old ZDMG 55.324, where on the
basis of the metrical evidence he surmises that, at least in this post-caesura position,
the form should be read with short root vowel (*jigi-vaṃs-), the form found in the
younger Vedic texts. See also Arnold (Ved. Met. 143), who considers the short-i
form required in 3 of the 5 occurrences of the strong stem, and Kü (189 n. 225), who
considers it proper except in III.15.4. Kü cites Anttila (1969, Schwebeabl. 61) as
explaining the lengthening in the Saṃhitā text as analogy to ninīvā́ṃs-. However, it is
much more likely that it is a morphologically conditioned lengthening, meant to
distinguish the -i-vowel proper to the root from the -i-liaison vowel that has become
associated with suffixes/endings. Thus jigī-vā́ṃs- with long vowel is kept separate
from the type tasth-ivā́ṃs-, as I already argued in my 1988 article on the vocalized
laryngeal (224–25), though without factoring in the metrical evidence pointing to this
lengthening as late and redactional. (Of course, in tasthivā́ṃs- the -i- would
originally have represented the zero-grade of this -ā root, but by synchronic RV it
has been reanalyzed as part of the suffix. See disc. in my 1988 art.)

<h3 id="vi198">VI.19.8</h3>
<p>In d the utá is oddly positioned, since it appears to be meant to conjoin
jāmī́m̐r ájāmīn “kin and non-kin,” there being no other likely candidates. Klein
(DGRV I.356–57) calls it a “peculiar passage” and classes it with two other examples
of what he schematizes as utá X Y (/ Z …). The pair jāmí- ájāmi- is several times
asyndectic (I.111.3, IV.4.5, VI.44.17) as here, so no conjunction is actually necessary,
but we can cite nearby VI.25.3 … jāmáya utá yé ‘jāmayaḥ, where the utá is correctly
placed. Perhaps our passage is a blend of the asyndectic figure and the “X and which
Y” construction in VI.25.3.</p>
<h3 id="vi1910">VI.19.10</h3>
<p>The medial 1st pl. s-aor. opt. vaṃsīmáhi contrasts with the active 1st pl. saor. subjunctive váṃsāma in 8c, but the medial optative must have been modeled on
the rhyme form maṃsīmáhi in the same metrical position in 7d. The “rest” following
vaṃsīmáhi may call attention to the verb by isolating it metrically.
Besides this echo, note also nṛvát, which replicates nṛvát in 1a, and vāmám
recalling vāmásya in 5b, while the gen. vásvaḥ is in slight discord with the differently
formed gen. vásunaḥ in 5b.
I tr. śrómatebhiḥ as ‘attentions’, that is, the attentive hearing(s) that Indra
gives to men’s words. For similar use of śrómata- in a somewhat clearer context see
VII.40.5.
The referent of the “both kinds of good[s]” in c is not clear, at least from
immediate context. In the very similar passage VII.82.4 īśānā́vásva ubháyasya, it
seems to refer to goods belonging to war and peace; similarly in the next hymn,
VII.83.5 yuváṃ hí vásva ubháyasya rā́jathaḥ, where a reference to war and peace &ndash;
or perhaps to the goods of enemies and of allies &ndash; is likely. In II.9.5 the referent of
ubháyam … vasavyàm is also open-ended, but Re’s suggestion there that it’s
livestock and offspring is perhaps the most satisfactory. In our passage the nearest
contrastive pair is jāmī́m̐r ájāmīn “kin and non-kin” in 8c, so perhaps “both kinds of
good[s]” refers to the goods belonging to these two groups whom we hope vanquish
in battle. Note vṛtrā́ṇy ubháyāni “both kinds of obstacles” in 13c, which Ge,
persuasively, takes as referring to the “kin and non-kin” of 8d. MLW suggests
another possibility: “movable and immovable,” which has a fine Indo-European
pedigree.
The acc. obj. phrase in d, rátnam máhi sthūrám bṛhántam, contains an
apparent gender clash: rátna- is neut., as is máhi; sthūrám can be either neut. or
masc., while bṛhántam must be masc. It is tempting to correlate the two genders with
the two kinds of goods in pāda c: a “great treasure” (neut.) and “substantial lofty X”
(masc.). This might be possible: sthūrá- bṛhánt- qualifies masc. rayí- in IV.21.4
sthūrásya rāyó bṛható yá ī́śe (and cf. X.156.3 ā́gne sthūráṃ rayím bhara), and
bṛhánt- not infrequently modifies rayí- (cf., e.g., VI.6.7). Thus, we could assume an
underlying *rayím for the last two adjectives, yielding a tr. “grant a great treasure
(and) substantial lofty (wealth).” This might be supported by rāyā́… bṛhatā́in the
last pāda of the hymn (13d). Nonetheless, this seems unduly artificial, and I would
prefer to assume that at the end of this acc. phrase, encouraged by ambig. sthūrám,
bṛhántam has simply taken its accustomed pāda-final place in Triṣṭubh. As reported
90
by Old (ZDMG 55.325 and Noten), Ludwig suggested substituting (that is,
emending) rayím for máhi, a suggestion roundly rejected by Old, who simply says
(Noten) that masc. bṛhántam is construed with neut. rátnam.</p>
<h3 id="vi1912">VI.19.12</h3>
<p>Note a different kind of gender mismatch in pāda a. Though in the idiom
with √man “consider oneself X” / “be considered as X,” X is in the same case as the
underlying subject (see, e.g., 7c maṃsīmahi jigīvāṃsaḥ “we could be considered
victors”), here it is construed with an adverbial neut. máhi. That this is not
necessarily a property of “think oneself great” is shown by I.178.5, VII.98.4 maható
mányamānān “… those thinking themselves great,” with acc. pl. matching the subject
of the participle.</p>

<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the “ask” in this hymn comes at the beginning,
not the end as is more usual. It is also excessively convoluted in syntax and
phraseology. (My interpr. of the vs. is in great part guided by Th [Fremdl. 58] and to
a certain extent Ge., though as far as I can see Ge simply fails to tr. parts of it.) The
actual referent of the definitional rel. cl. that occupies the first hemistich is not
encountered until the second word of pāda b (rayíḥ), preceded by a discontinuous
simile dyaúr ná … bhū́ma “like heaven the earth,” whose first part has been fronted
around the rel. prn. yáḥ, and by a verb in tmesis, abhí … tasthaú “surmounts,” whose
preverb is stationed after the caesura in pāda a and whose verb form proper opens
pāda b. And this is only the beginning!
A first paraphrase of the first hemistich would be “as heaven (surmounts) the
earth, the wealth that surmounts …,” with “wealth” corresponding grammatically
and functionally to “heaven.” This first stab makes it immediately clear that we need
an acc. obj. in the frame to correspond to bhū́ma in the simile, something that wealth
can “surmount.” One acc. is obvious: jánān at the end of the hemistich. But what do
we do with aryáḥ at the end of the first pāda? Old (ZDMG 54.169–70) takes it as an
acc. pl., tr. “wie die Himmel über der Erde (sollen) die Schätze über den Geizigen
(erhaben sein).” However, there is a reasonably well-attested phrase rā́yo aryáḥ “the
riches of the stranger” (IV.48.1, VI.14.3, VI.47.9, and esp. VI.36.5; cf. also VI.1.5
and comm. on all those passages). In VI.36.5 it is found in exactly this context: dyaúr
ná bhū́mābhí rā́yo aryáḥ “Like heaven over the earth, sur(mount) the riches of the
stranger,” with rā́yo aryáḥ an object phrase exactly parallel to bhū́ma in the simile. It
therefore seems best here to assume a gapping of acc. pl. rā́yaḥ, whose presence is
suggested by the nom. rayíḥ, with aryáḥ a gen. as elsewhere. Hence “wealth that
surmounts (the wealth/riches) of the stranger …”
91
And what does this “wealth of the stranger” consist of? In all cases it seems to
refer to manpower, not to material wealth, and our passage makes this clear by
further specifying it as jánān ‘people(s)’.
As if the poet hadn’t misled us enough already with the intertwining of
constituents and gapping of a crucial word, he also plants a false cue. The word
bhū́ma is of course the acc. sg. to the neut. n-stem bhū́man-, as shown esp. by the
parallel VI.36.5. But in its position directly after the preverb abhí, it looks mighty
like a verb &ndash; and could almost (but only almost) be the 1st pl. root aor. bhūma,
though with wrong accent (expect *bhūmá, a form not found in the RV). The lexeme
abhí √bhū is close in meaning to the abhí √sthā we have here (whose verbal part has
been postponed till the 2nd pāda), and given its sandhi form the rel. prn. yá
(underlying yáḥ) could equally be underlying yé, which could match the number of
the putative 1st pl. verb form (“we who surmount …”). Of course, as just noted, the
accent on bhū́ma is wrong, and we would further expect abhí to lose its own accent
and univerbate with an immediately following verb in a rel. clause. But I nonetheless
think that the poet meant for his audience to follow this false trail, however briefly.
After this tangled beginning, the second hemistich is completely
straightforward: the acc. tám picks up the rel. cl. couched in the nom., with the
implicit referent “wealth,” modified by three acc. OBJ+VERBAL NOMINAL cmpds, all
objects of “give” (daddhí). This is the last time in the hymn that Indra is asked to
give us anything; the only other appeal to Indra is in 10a, where we pray to “win
anew.” Almost all of the rest of the hymn treats previous heroic deeds of Indra,
though it should be noted that many of these are presented in the injunctive, and the
notoriously slippery usage of the injunctive may leave the possibility of current
application open.</p>
<h3 id="vi202">VI.20.2</h3>
<p>This vs. begins like vs. 1, with a form of ‘heaven’ followed by the simile
marker ná (1a dyaúr ná, 2a divó ná). In this case there is nothing in the frame that
explicitly corresponds to the gen. diváḥ in the simile, though the dat. túbhyam is
roughly parallel: like the “lordship of heaven,” lordship was conceded to you (Indra)
and is therefore yours.
The standard idiom for ‘concede’ is ánu √dā, not, as here, ánu √dhā. Cf.,
with phraseology similar to here, VI.25.8 ánu te dāyi … satrā́te víśvam … (sim.
II.20.8). But √dhā is also found in this idiom elsewhere, e.g., VI.36.2 satrā́dadhire
ánu vīryā̀ya. Old (ZDMG 55.326, Noten) seems prepared to follow Gr (Tr.) and v.
Bradke in emending dhāyi to *dāyi, but this seems unnec. The two roots are formally
very parallel and in many contexts their meanings are barely distinguishable; I see no
reason why √dhā cannot have acquired this idiomatic meaning with ánu in imitation
of ánu √dā. In this particular case ánu √dhā may have been used in preference to
ánu √dā because of the technical use of anudéya- in vs. 11 below. See disc. there.
Note that the ‘lordship, lordly power’ (asuryà-) is in the control of the gods
and conceded to Indra, another indication that the later Asura/Deva divide is not
present in the core RV. See also VI.36.1 below.
92</p>
<h3 id="vi203">VI.20.3</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. takes Indra as the subj. of ā́vat in d, with dartnúm an action
noun “when he aided the splitting …” But, on the basis of other -(t)nú-stems (cf. AiG
II.2.696–97 and 741–42), dartnú- is more likely verbal/agentive (‘splitting, splitter’)
and the subject of ā́vat should then be soma (“the somian honey” mádhu- sómyá-).
So explicitly Old (ZDMG 55.326, with convincing parallels; Ge appears to follow,
though his tr. is more equivocal. I would therefore change the tr. to “when it [=soma]
aided the splitter of all the strongholds.”
VI.20.4–5: As Ge (n. 4–5) notes, these two vss. probably belong together as an
account of the ever-fragmented Śuṣṇa / Kutsa myth, though the connection of the
Paṇis (pāda a) to this myth is somewhat uncertain. Old (ZDMG 55.326–27) treats
these vss. in detail.</p>
<h3 id="vi204">VI.20.4</h3>
<p>I read the instr. plurals opening the two hemistichs (śataíḥ 4a, vadhaíḥ 4c)
“vertically” &ndash; that is, as a single NP distributed over two clauses. This seems to be
Ge’s solution too: “Durch hundert (Streiche) …; durch (deine) Streiche …”; so also
Old ZDMG 55.326. The fact that a form of √pad needs to be read in pāda c,
matching apadran in pāda a supports this interpr. It would, however, be possible to
interpr. śataíḥ as “by the hundreds,” referring to the felled Paṇis. So Kü (424).
In the publ. tr. I took the beneficiary of Indra’s actions in pāda b to be a single
person, “the ten-armed poet” (dáśoṇaye kaváye)(so Ge), and since dáśoṇi- recurs in
8a apparently qualifying vetasú-, I considered this to be a reference to this shadowy
Vetasu. But I now think this identification is incorrect or at least misleading. When
the word kaví- is found in an Indra / Kutsa / Śuṣṇa context it always (in my current
view) refers to Uśanā Kāvya, and I believe that to be the case here — strengthened
by the fact that the other two occurrences of arká-sāti- (I.174.7, VI.26.3) are found
with kaví- in the Kutsa / Śuṣṇa myth, where the word must surely refer to Uśanā
Kāvya. (Old makes the same point, ZDMG 55.326–27.) I therefore now think that
“for the poet” means “for Uśanā Kāvya,” and “for the ten-armed” is likely a
reference to a different person, identified as Vetasu in vs. 8. (Old considers the
additional possibility that dáśoṇi- is an epithet of UK, but seems to favor the
separation into two individuals.) On the basis of 8a and Ge’s disc. there (n. 8), it
further seems likely, or at least possible, that vetasú- in 8 refers to Kutsa, and
therefore in our 4b the two datives refer to Kutsa and UK. I would therefore now
alter the tr. to “for the sake of the ten-armed one [=Kutsa?] and of the poet [=Uśanā
Kāvya].”
My tr. of dáśoṇi- in this vs. and in 8a reflects the current consensus, endorsed
by Mayr (EWA s.v. oṇí- “offenbar ‘Arm’”), that oṇí- means ‘arm’ (as opposed to
Gr’s ‘Schutz’ and ‘Mutterbrust’), but I think that this interpr. might be ripe for
revisiting. The passages are not particularly diagnostic &ndash; the most important
evidence is the fact that the stem is generally dual &ndash; and it lacks a clear etymology
(though it’s sometimes connected with √av ‘help’). There is also the question of the
cmpd. sandhi: if dáśoṇi- consists of dáśa + oṇí-, it should of course come out as
*dáśauṇi-. The -o- has been accounted for (see EWA s.v. oṇí- [p.c from J. Schindler],
93
Mayr PN s.v. dáśoniya-) by invoking TS I.2.6.1, where the widely attested mantra
abhí tyáṃ deváṃ savitā́ram oṇyòḥ kavíkratum (AV VII.14.1, etc.) instead contains
ūṇyòḥ. The ū- initial would indeed yield the proper sandhi result, but given the
otherwise overwhelming attestation of oṇyòḥ in the mantra, the TS variant does not
have much support. Since at present I don’t have a better solution, I stick with ‘tenarmed’, but consider it quite dubious.
That arká-sāti means ‘winning of the (sun’s) rays’ is strongly suggested by
sū́ryasya sātaú in the next vs. (5d), though, as Old points out (ZDMG 55.327), it
could in addition mean ‘winning of the chants’.
I don’t understand pāda d, but I would point out that another “insatiable Śuṣṇa”
passage also has a mention of mealtime: IV.16.12 kútsāya śúṣṇam aśúṣaṃ ní barhīḥ,
prapitvé áhnaḥ kúyavaṃ sahásrā “For Kutsa you laid low insatiable Śuṣṇa, who
brings bad harvest, with his thousands, before the day&rsquo;s first meal.” Perhaps the point
is that despite his voraciousness, Śuṣṇa is deprived of his meal by Indra’s timely
blow. In that case the subj. of arirecīt … prá here is Indra, who leaves nothing for
Śuṣṇa.</p>
<h3 id="vi205">VI.20.5</h3>
<p>For the unusual position of sá and its rukied initial (urú ṣá) see disc. ad
VI.2.4.</p>
<h3 id="vi208">VI.20.8</h3>
<p>This vs. is made difficult both by our very sketchy knowledge of the
personnel and the myth and by the syntax. Both Old (ZDMG 55.328–29) and Ge (n.
8) devote considerable space to disc. of it. The vs. seems to pun on PNs in a way
discouragingly similar to VII.18, the very obscure account of the Ten Kings battle.
The nearby vs. VI.26.4 is of some help in the interpr. of this one, as is X.49.4.
My approach to the vs. partly follows Ge’s, but differs in several important
ways. Like Ge (who adopted it from Baunack; see his n. 8), I supply a verb of
speaking to introduce the second hemistich, which we both take as the direct speech
of Indra. (By contrast Old construes úpa sṛjā in d as the verb governing the acc. in ab,
but given the distribution of the rest of the elements in the vs., esp. the preverb ā́
opening pāda c, this seems unlikely.) But rather than taking the acc. PNs in ab as the
addressees of this speech as Ge does, I construe them (loosely) with the hapax
bahuvrīhi svabhiṣṭí-sumnaḥ ‘having/showing the favor of his dominance’, with
Vetasu [=Kutsa?] and Tuji as the recipient of this favor. The intens. adj. tū́tuji-
‘thrusting’, found elsewhere modifying a whirlwind (bhṛ́mi- IV.32.2) and a chariot
(X.35.6), punningly points to Tuji, who is found in nearby VI.26.4 in the company of
Vetasu and Tugra, as here. (In that vs. there is also redupl., but it is located on the
verb: tváṃ tújim … tūtoḥ “you strengthened Tuji.”)
In that vs. Indra strikes down Tugra for Vetasu (VI.26.4c tváṃ túgraṃ
vetasáve sácāhan). I think the same situation is depicted here in cd, though less
violently, with Vetasu(-Kutsa) referred to by the adj. dyótana- ‘brilliant, flashing’
expressing a dat. of benefit. In this connection Baunack’s adducing (see Ge’s n. 8c)
of I.63.3 kutsā́ya dyumaté “for heaven-bright Kutsa,” another dat. of benefit in the
Śuṣṇa myth, is apposite. Ge (also Gr, Mayr PN) takes dyótanāya as a PN, but no such
94
person Dyotana is found elsewhere, and in its other two occurrences (I.123.4,
VIII.29.2) the stem is an adj. with the expected etymological meaning.
The next question is íbham. This is pretty much universally interp. as a PN,
referring to another enemy of Indra. This is in part based on X.49.4, where Tugra
and one Smadibha are made subject to Kutsa (and the Vetasus [pl.] and Tuji are also
found). Old, for ex., considers Ibha here simply a shortening of Smadibha, and the
context of the word in our pāda certainly supports a pun on the latter name: (ā́
túgraṃ śá)śvad íbham …; cf. X.49.4 (túgraṃ kútsāya) smádibham, with the last
syllable of the adverb śáśvad a close match for the 1st syllable of the PN in X.49.4 (if
it is indeed a PN). But íbha- is elsewhere in the RV a common noun meaning
‘retinue’ or ‘vassal’ (the common denominator being the inferior position vis-à-vis
someone in power); cf. also the MIA evidence, such as Pāli ibbha. And ‘vassal’
would be an appropriate word for someone made subject to another &ndash; hence my tr. of
the phrase śáśvad íbham as “perpetual vassal,” referring to Tugra.
Finally, we must deal with the verbal expressions at the end of the vs., úpa
śṛjā iyádhyai. The first question is what form sṛjā represents out of sandhi. The Pp.
reads sṛja, that is, a 2nd sg. act. impv., with lengthening of the final vowel in the
Saṃhitā text. But of course in that case the normal outcome in sandhi should be
coalescence into *sṛjeyádhyai. After some agonizing, Old accepts the Pp interpr.
(though he also flirts with a 2nd sg. subj. sṛjāḥ), but Ge (n. 8) opts instead for
Baunack’s suggestion, that the underlying form is sṛjai, i.e., a 1st sg. middle
subjunctive (so also Lub, though with !). This is the interpr. I have also adopted.
Although the 6th cl. pres. sṛja- is predominately active, there are a few middle forms;
the pf. is about evenly divided between active and middle forms in transitive usage
(including several 1st pl. sasṛjmáhe with úpa), and there are two 1st sg. s-aor. forms
ásṛkṣi with úpa in trans. usage. Taking the form as a 1st sg. also entails the directspeech interpr. of Baunack/Ge. (It&rsquo;s worth noting as an aside that Sāy. simply glosses
upa sṛja with upāsṛjat, apparently untroubled by matters of sandhi and grammatical
identity; this was followed by Gr [Tr.], though unmentioned in the Wö.)
As Old points out (ZDMG 55.328), the lexeme úpa √sṛj is often used of
releasing / dispatching calves to their mother, and this must account for the simile
mātúr ná. Although this idiom is generally benevolent, it also emphasizes the
hierarchical dependency of the young on their mother, and this would be appropriate
for the vassal Tugra’s subordinate position with regard to Kutsa.
I take the inf. iyádhyai to √i ‘go’, or more particularly to the stem ī́yate
‘speeds’ (√i or √yā), rather than to √yā ‘implore, beg’ with Lub. It simply completes
the action of the main verb “release/depatch them to go …” The preverb ā́beginning
the 2nd hemistich is more likely to go with this inf. than with úpa srjai (pace Gr, also
Ge, who thinks [n. 8c] it could go with either one), simply because we’d otherwise
expect the order úpa+ā́(cf. VIII.27.11 úpa … ā́m̐, ásṛkṣi …).
After all this, the alterations of the publ. tr. would be minimal:
“Indra showed the favor of his dominance to Vetasu [=Kutsa?] of the ten
tricks and ten arms and to the thrusting (Tuji), (saying)
95
‘Tugra as perpetual vassal for brilliant (Vetasu=Kutsa?) shall I dispatch, like
(calves) to their mother, to speed (to him).’”</p>
<h3 id="vi209">VI.20.9</h3>
<p>The participial phrase bíbhrad vájram here and in VI.23.1 below may be
intended to invoke the name bharád-vāja-, the poet of this hymn and indeed of this
maṇḍala, by an expression that seems the syntactic equivalent of that type of
governing compound — with the prior member belonging to the same root and the
2nd member a phonological variant of the obj. Matching the first member exactly
would be problematic, since the nom. sg. of the participle would be bháran. The
punning on PNs noted with regard to the immediately preceding vs. may be in
evidence here as well.n</p>
<h3 id="vi2010">VI.20.10</h3>
<p>In b enā́can simply be adverbial, as Ge and KH (Injunk. 168) take it, but it
is also regularly used as demonstrative with forms like námasā ‘homage’ (I.171.1,
II.23.14, etc.), sūkténa ‘hymn’ (II.6.2), bráhmaṇā (IV.36.7), and in this context,
where the sacrifice is mentioned (yajñaíḥ), I think it likely that the verbal part of the
ritual evidenced by the verb prá … stavante “they start up the praise” is further
specified with the near deictic, referring to this current praise hymn.
The syntactic relationship between pādas c and d is ambiguous. With Ge, I
take d as the main cl., with c dependent on it. But KH (Injunk. 168) takes them as
parallel subordinate clauses dependent on b. Either is possible, because the verb of d,
(d)hán, is initial in the pāda and can owe its accent to that alone.
Note the allit. in (śā́ra)dīr dárd, dhán dā́s(īḥ), esp. noticeable because it
consists of four syllables in a row, belonging to four separate words.
Old (ZDMG 55.329–30 and Noten) calls dart in c into question, arguing that
it should be a 2nd ps. and the -t is faulty. But there seems no reason not to assume that
both dart and (d)han are 3rd ps. verbs; although Indra is referred to in the 2nd ps. in
pāda a, shift between the persons is a commonplace in RVic discourse. The sandhi
situation here favors the retention of the -t, though the matter is somewhat complex.
As is generally known, final clusters are simplified, retaining only the first. The
exception is that -t, -ṭ, and -k after -r- are retained if they belong to the root (Wh, Gr.
§150b Macd. VGS §28a, etc.) &ndash; which the -t in dar-t does not (√dṛ). However, dart
is pāda-final and the next pāda begins in the transmitted text with dhán (for hán),
whose dh is the automatic result of the (re-)introduction of occlusion of initial hafter a final stop (see, e.g., Wh, Gr. §163). The standard practice is that the h- is
replaced by the voiced aspirate corresponding to the place of articulartion of the final
stop &ndash; in this case, a dental. If we assume that this rule was operative before final
clusters were simplified, a sequence of 3rd sg. dard dhán with apparently pleonastic
gemination would favor the non-simplification of the cluster -rd dh-. (On cases of
gemination and degemination in the text, see my “False Segmentations and
Resegmentations in the Rigveda: Gemination and Degemination” [to appear in a
forthcoming Fs.].) Pāda c is identical to I.174.2b, and in that passage the case is more
difficult because there the context is entirely 2nd ps. As I argued in the comm. to that
vs. (q.v.), the final -t there may have been introduced from our passage.

<p>Pāda c contains one of the three instances of the gerundive anudéya- in the
RV and the only masc. form &ndash; a form called by Ge “ganz unsicher.” This gerundive
belongs to the lexeme ánu √dā ‘hand over, concede’ discussed above, ad vs. 2. I
have discussed one of the fem. forms anudéyī in the difficult hymn X.135 at length
(“The Earliest Evidence for the Inborn Debts of a Brahmin: A New Interpretation of
Ṛgveda X.135.” Journal asiatique 302.2 [2014]: 245–57). In that article I established
that the idiom ánu √dā can be further narrowed in certain contexts to mean
‘forgive/acquit a debt’; and the debt in question can be referred to with the gerund
anudéya-, -ī, as (the debt) ‘to be acquited’. In X.135.5-6 this debt is actually a
reference to the inborn debts of a Brahman, which he must pay off during his lifetime,
one of which is the need to provide his ancestors with (grand)sons. As argued in that
article (255–56), I think the same sense can be seen in our passage. To cite from the
article: “The second half of this verse seems to allude to a complex intergenerational
relationship in which Indra intervenes. The god hands over a grandson (nápāt-) to his
grandfather (mahé pitré), a transaction that sounds like a man&rsquo;s fulfillment of his debt
to his ancestors by fathering a son, thereby providing them with a grandson. This
grandson is said to be anudéya-. I would suggest that the grandson here serves as the
concrete manifestation of the debt that is to be acquitted, and the technical term
anudéya- is therefore applied to him. If I am correct, this is another, though more
muted, piece of evidence for the existence of the notion of a man&rsquo;s inborn debt in the
Rig Veda.”</p>

<p>This is identical to I.174.9; see comm. on that vs., esp. with regard to párṣi.</p>
<h3 id="vi2013">VI.20.13</h3>
<p>Dabhīti is the beneficiary of Indra’s putting Cumuri to sleep in VI.26.6.
Cumuri’s companion Dhuni is found with him in VI.18.8, and in our passage he
immediately follows vs. 12, which contains two adj. usages of dhúni- ‘tumultuous,
boisterous’.
The second hemistich portrays Dabhīti assembling or preparing four different
requisites of the sacrifice in four different morphosyntactic expressions: 1) a full
participial phrase sómebhiḥ sunván “pressing with the soma juices,” 2) a bahuvrīhi
idhmábhṛtiḥ lit. ‘having the bringing of the firewood’, 3) an -ín-stem possessive
pakthī́‘having cooked food’ (based on an unattested *pakthá- ‘cooked food’), and 4)
an instr. of accompaniment arkaíḥ “along with the chants.” The identity of the third
has been called into question by Old (ZDMG 55.330, Noten). Though the sandhi
form pakthy is analyzed by the Pp. as pakthī́with the long vowel appropriate to the
nom. sg. of an -ín-stem, in fact in the cadence it would better be read short (though
keep in mind the metrical disturbances throughout the hymn). Old toys with the idea
that it has been influenced by the PN pakthá- and that it is underlyingly an instr. to
the -ti-stem paktí- ‘cooked food’, hence *paktī́with shortening before the following
vowel. This seems unnecessarily complex, and the PN pakthá- is neither well attested
nor found nearby this passage. Since shortening of -ī́in hiatus was available for the
instr., I see no reason why it shouldn’t have been analogically extended to the nom.
97
of an -ín-stem in this case. Moreover, I think the morphosyntactic variety just
described was deliberate, and replacing 3) with an instr. like that of 4) would disturb
the sequence.</p>
<h2 id="vi21-indra">VI.21 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="vi211-1">VI.21.1</h3>
<p>As with hemistich initial #śataíḥ … #vadhaíḥ in VI.20.4 in the immediately
preceding hymn, I take #imā́ḥ … #dhíyaḥ as a “vertical” NP, “these insights.” Their
positioning allows them to get out of the way of the intense etym. figure in b: hávyam
… hávyā havante. This figure is complicated by the fact that hávya- is used in two
slightly different senses, controlled by slightly different constructions of the verb
√hū / hvā. Although the normal object of this verb is a god or other being called
upon, very occasionally it can take the call itself as object (see comm. ad IV.23.3),
and of course derivatives like háva(na)- express the call itself. In our passage
havante ‘they invoke’ takes the usual type of object, namely Indra here, who is
qualified by the gerundive hávya- ‘to be invoked’. But the insights (dhíyaḥ)
themselves are also so qualified; here hávyāḥ must mean not ‘to be invoked’, but ‘to
be called [=spoken]’. In order to keep the vocabulary constant, I have tr. ‘deserving
to invoke’, in contrast to ‘deserving to be invoked’ applied to Indra.
The vertical NP just discussed unbalances syntactic constituency, and,
unusually, the hemistich boundary cannot be respected.
In d most take īyate to √yā / ī ‘implore, beg’; so, e.g., Ge “… wird … erbeten”
(likewise Lub, Kulikov, -ya-presents 495). I assign it rather to ‘speeds’, though either
is possible.</p>
<h3 id="vi212">VI.21.2</h3>
<p>The nominal rel. cl. yó vídānaḥ, interrupting a string of accusatives, is
syntactically curious. It seems to represent a sort of izafe, rather than a real
embedded relative cl. I have tr. it as if acc. índram were the predicate of the
participle (“who is known as “Indra”), despite the difference in cases. Ge, in contrast:
“der bekannt ist.” My interpr. might be better represented as “I will praise him —
Indra, as he is known — whose …” This interpr. fits well with the doubts expressed
about Indra later in the hymn, esp. vs. 4. See also vídānaḥ in 12b.
The instr. gīrbhíḥ in b might be better construed with the verb stuṣe in a: “I
will praise him with songs”; it has been displaced to the right to be nearer to
gírvāhasam.
The second hemistich contains a strikingly mixed construction, with the usual
matched pair heaven and earth in two different cases, acc. dívam, abl.-gen. pṛthivyā́ḥ,
though construed with the same verb. The two different cases are controlled by two
different PREVERB + √ric combinations, one overt, one implied. Overt is áti √ric
‘extend beyond, surpass’, which is rather rare but takes the acc., as in VIII.92.14, 22
ná tvā́m indrā́ti ricyate “nothing surpasses you, Indra” (cf. also X.90.5); hence our …
dívam áti … riricé. The implied construction is the more common prá √ric ‘extend
beyond’ which takes the abl., as in I.61.9 asyéd evá prá ririce mahitváṃ, divás
pṛthivyā́ḥ pári antárikṣāt “his greatness projected beyond heaven and earth, beyond
98
the midspace” (note clear abl. antárikṣāt) (cf. also I.59.5, 109.6, etc.), hence our …
pṛthivyā́ḥ … ririce mahitvám. Examples of this latter constr. are found in this group
of Indra hymns (VI.24.3, 30.1), and despite the absence of prá here it is not
surprising that the abl. construction would creep in.</p>
<h3 id="vi213">VI.21.3</h3>
<p>On the meaning of vayúna-, see comm. ad II.34.4.
As has long been known, the RVic desid. stem íyakṣa- belongs to √naś
‘attain’, not (pace Gr) √yaj ‘sacrifice’. See, inter alia, EWA s.v. NAŚ 1
; Heenen
(Desid. 79–82).
The question in the 2nd hemistich seems like a non sequitur, which makes me
somewhat sympathetic to Sāy’s reading as a (negative) indefinite: kadā cid “they do
not ever violate …” But this reinterpr. is arbitrary, of course, and further, the kadā́
question inaugurates a series of questions in vs. 4, each with a ka- form: a kúha, b
kám … kā́su, c káḥ, d káḥ … katamáḥ. It may be that we have to ask about the
whereabouts of Indra in vs. 4 because he has ceased to appear to us because we have
(or may have) violated his ordinances.</p>
<h3 id="vi214">VI.21.4</h3>
<p>-tama-forms implicitly index a referent among three or more possibilities.
The interrog. katamá- here echoes purutáma- of 1a. I have chosen to render katamáwith the heavy tr. ‘which of many’ because in this series of questions the poet is
anxiously surveying all the possible sacrifices and sacrificers who may have attracted
Indra away from us.</p>
<h3 id="vi215">VI.21.5</h3>
<p>The utá in the middle of pāda c uncomplicatedly conjoins the temporally
contrastive madhyamā́saḥ “the middle ones, those in between” and nū́tanāsaḥ “the
current ones” (see Klein DGRV I.301, 311), but the one beginning pāda d, in Klein’s
words (DGRV I.382) “introduc[es] a new nonparallel clause.” It is not represented in
the publ. tr., which should perhaps read “And … take cognizance of the one who is
closest.” The reason for this apparently pleonastic conjunction may be that “the
closest one” (singular avamá-) is not only a subset of “the current ones” (plural
nū́tanāsaḥ), but the climax of the series of temporally sorted comrades.</p>
<h3 id="vi216">VI.21.6</h3>
<p>This ultimate insider, “the closest one” of 5d, is immediately picked up by
the slightly more distanced “closer ones” (ávarāsaḥ) in 6a. Here their comparative
closeness is not contrasted with previous generations of Indra’s comrades, as in vs. 5,
but with the older, distant deeds of Indra. These closer one are “asking” (pṛchántaḥ)
about Indra. Their asking may refer directly to the questions in vs. 4, but it also
implies that, however “close” they are, they do not have direct access to knowledge
about Indra.
The limits on our knowledge are explicitly acknowledged in the 2nd hemistich,
where we praise Indra only insofar as know him (yā́d evá vidmá). This subordinated
expression is embedded in the larger clause: árcāmasi …, yā́d evá vidmá tā́t tvā
mahā́ntam, where the obj. of árcāmasi is tvā, but the yā́d … tā́d diptych is clearly
99
formulaic and frozen. This expression reminds us slightly of the yó vídānaḥ of 2b,
likewise with √vid ‘know’ and likewise technically embedded.</p>
<h3 id="vi217">VI.21.7</h3>
<p>JPB suggests that the “face of the demon” spreading out against Indra is
hood of the cobra, namely Vṛtra.
The referent of the expression beginning b, máhi jajñānám “having been born
great,” is entirely ambiguous. It may be, as the publ. tr. takes it, an acc. with tvā,
referring to Indra. Or it may be, as Gr and Ge take it, a neut. nom. modifying the neut.
s-stem pā́jaḥ. Technically speaking, of course, máhi is neut. and might therefore give
weight to the latter possibility. But máhi can be adverbial here, evoking the
apparently fixed expression máhi jātám (I.163.1, III.31.3, cf. I.156.2); cf. also V.60.3
máhi vṛddháḥ ‘grown great’. I now think the ambigity is meant, and the phrase can
apply to either of the antagonists (or rather, in the case of the rakṣás-) its visage. The
ambiguity is hard to convey in tr.; perhaps “… (each) born great.”
The two verbs in the first hemistich, abhí … ví tasthe# and … abhí … tiṣṭha#,
belong to the same root (√sthā), are positioned identically, and differ fairly
minimally from each other: tense-aspect stem, voice, person, as well as an extra
preverb with the first. Unfortunately the etymological connection can’t be easily
capture in tr.: “has stood wide against you” is unidiomatic and opaque.
The 2nd hemistich seems implicitly to convey that our anxieties about our
intimacy with Indra were well-founded. In 5ab our forebears were identified as
Indra’s “ancient comrades” (pratnā́saḥ … sákhāyaḥ), with later generations
apparently grandfathered into this select group (5cd). But here we learn who Indra’s
“ancient comrade” really is — his mace: táva pratnéna yújyena sákhyā vájreṇa.</p>
<h3 id="vi219">VI.21.9</h3>
<p>The use of parallel and etymologically related purpose datives ūtáye and
ávase, stationed in the a and b pādas respectively, seems pleonastic. I have tr. one as
nominal and one as infinitival, but this distinction rests on nothing in the passage.</p>
<h3 id="vi2110">VI.21.10</h3>
<p>Like 1b, pāda c here contains an extravagant etymological figure based
again on √hvā ‘call’: hávam (ā́) huvató huvānáḥ.
The phrasing of d also seems awkwardly pleonastic &ndash; ná tvā́vām̐anyáḥ .. tvád
asti “no one like you exists, other than you” &ndash; in comparison with the usual
expression, found in nearby VI.30.4 ná tvā́vām̐anyó asti “there exists no one else
like you” (cf. VII.32.23).</p>
<h3 id="vi2111">VI.21.11</h3>
<p>In c Ge tr. āsúḥ as if it were a present: “die Agni zur Zunge haben und die
Wahrheit pflegen.” Although this is contextually tempting, the pf. of √as is never
presential. Cf. Kü (111): “Es ist stets (zumindest auch) vergangenheits bezogen
gebraucht.” At best we could render it “who have (always) had Agni as their tongue
…”; this might in fact be better.
In any case the pf. āsúḥ in c matches cakrúḥ in d, and this latter action appears
to be one in the distant past &ndash; even though it’s not entirely clear what action it refers
to. Interpr. is not helped by the fact that dása- is a hapax, though it is reasonable,
100
with Ge (n. 11d), to take it as “der mythische Stammvater der Dāsa’s oder Dasyu’s,”
or indeed referentially identical with the well-attested stem dā́sa- referring to some
variety of enemy to the Ārya (see Old, etc.). But what the relationship between Manu
and Dasa is in this passage and what the gods were attempting to bring about are both
unclear &ndash; an unclarity also facilitated by the ambiguity of úpara-, which can mean,
inter alia, ‘lower’, ‘closer’, or ‘later’. The publ. tr. “… put Manu very close to Dasa”
is opaque; in fact I do not now know what I meant by it. Ge takes úpara- as ‘later’
and assumes that the gods made Manu Dasa’s successor (Nachfolger). I am now
inclined towards Old’s solution, however: that the gods put Manu below (the ‘lower’
sense of úpara-) in the earthly region “for Dasa,” with the dative of malefit, not
benefit: they set Manu to do to Dasa whatever he deserved. MLW comments
“Wouldn&rsquo;t this most sense if it meant &lsquo;they made Manus superior to Dasa’? Could the
original meaning of *upara- as preserved in Avestan, be kept here? For the sentiment
cf. VI.19.13 śátroḥ-śatror úttara ít syāma.” this would be a neat solution, though I
wonder whether a reading that requires the opposite sense (‘above’) of one of the
senses of this stem (‘lower’) would be available.</p>

<p>To add to the similarities between VI.21 and VI.22 noted in the publ. intro.,

nearby VI.18.12).

<h3 id="vi222">VI.22.2</h3>
<p>The vs. lacks an overt finite verb. With Ge I supply a form of √arc, picking
up the main clause verb of vs. 1, abhy àrca of 1b. The instr. matíbhiḥ in our d is
parallel to gīrbhíḥ … ā́bhíḥ of 1b.
The “seven inspired poets” (saptá víprāsaḥ) evokes the Saptarṣi, the “seven
seers.” I am not certain whether the phrase here refers to the Saptarṣi and, further,
whether they are identical to the Navagvas; the numbers suggestnnot. It is worth
noting IV.42.8 asmā́kam átra pitáras tá āsan, saptá ṛ́ṣayaḥ “Our forefathers, the
Seven Seers, were here,” with pitáraḥ, as here, as well as IX.92.2 ṛ́ṣayaḥ saptá
víprāḥ, where the Seven Seers are identified as vípra-s.
The interpr. of the cmpd nakṣad-dābhá- given in the publ tr., ‘who catches up
to the cheat’, cannot be correct. That tr. assumed a structure of the verbal governing
cmpd type, like bharád-vāja-, but the accent is wrong. I therefore now see that a
conventional tatpuruṣa interpr., with the 2nd member an agent nominal governing the
first, should be the correct interpr.; so Gr ‘den Nahenden vernichtend’, Ge ‘der den
Einholenden (?) täuscht’. (Curiously AiG does not seem to comment on this cmpd,
despite its somewhat aberrant form) The cmpd thus conforms to the type hastagrābhá- ‘grasping the hand’, at least as to its 2nd member, but the first member
101
appears to be the weak form of the pres. part. to the pres. nákṣati (√nakṣ ‘approach,
reach’). I do not know, offhand, of any cmpds formally so constructed, and I am
further puzzled by the apparent sense ‘tricking / cheating / outwitting the one who
approaches’. Forms of the root √nakṣ generally have benevolent sense, as in the
medial nákṣate in this very hymn (5d), where the song ‘catches up’ to Indra, or act.
nákṣanti in this same Indra cycle, VI.34.3, where thoughts and voices approach Indra,
strengthening him, so there is no apparent reason for Indra to √dabh someone
innocently coming up to him. I would emend the tr. to “him who outwits the one(s)
approaching,” but still feel that the first member is concealing something I can’t
crack. Some light on the cmpd may be shed by the verb forms ānaśúḥ and nákṣate in
the following vss. (4b and 5d respectively; see below), and this set of vss. seem to
share preoccupations and themes. MLW suggests that nakṣat could represent the root
√naś ‘disappear, destroy’, with -s- suffix and desid. meaning (“who deceives the one
who seeks to destroy him”). This is semantically much more attractive than the
suggestions given above, but I am dubious about the morphology. The root √naś
does not have a desid. at any period of the language, and in any case we should
properly expect reduplicated *ninakṣa-. Moreover, non-caus. stems to this root have
the intrans. sense ‘disappear, perish’. The forms in the immediate vicinity cited
above that belong to naś / nakṣ ‘reach, attain’ would also cause interference.
Note the presence of both √dabh ‘trick, cheat’and √druh ‘deceive, lie’, with
Indra depicted as engaging in the former activity, but possessing speech that is
ádrogha- ‘undeceptive’. In 8a he attacks the “deceitful people” (jána- drúhvan-).</p>
<h3 id="vi223">VI.22.3</h3>
<p>The lack of accent on the demon. in the phrase asya rāyáḥ is notable. Ge tr.
“um solche Reichtum,” clearly taking asya as modifying rāyáḥ, and Old (ZDMG
61.828 [=KlSch 259]) defends a similar interpr., saying “der weitere Verlauf
schildert dann den Reichtum ausführlicher.” However, unaccented oblique stems of
ayám are ordinarily pronominal, and that interpr. is readily available here: the asya
can refer to Indra, who immediately precedes in a different case (índram).
On the yáḥ of pāda c as breaking the pattern established earlier in the hymn of
reference to Indra, see the publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="vi224">VI.22.4</h3>
<p>Although there is no overt mark, I take initial tán no ví vocaḥ as a question
(contra Ge), matching the overt questions in cd and introducing the indirect question
in the yádi clause; see also prchántī in the next vs. and the questions in the previous
hymn, VI.21 3–4, 6).
The poet seems to be harking back to vs. 2 in 4ab and vs. 3 in 4cd. In vs. 2 the
ancestral poets praised Indra, but the god is described as nakṣad-dābhá- ‘outwitting
the one(s) approaching’. Here the poet asks if previous singers obtained (ānaśúḥ)
Indra’s favor. Although this pf. belongs to the root √(n)aś ‘attain, reach’, which is
synchronically separate from √nakṣ ‘approach’, the latter root is a fairly transparent
enlargement or development of the former (see EWA s.v. NAŚ1
, p. 28; Narten,
SigAor. 160, Gotō, 1st Kl., 192), and, of course, some forms of √(n)aś have the root
syllable nakṣ (e.g., desid. ínakṣati, though see íyakṣati in the previous hymn, VI.21.3).
102
I therefore suggest that ānaśúḥ implicitly responds to nakṣat- in 2c. With my new
(and, I hope, more accurate) interpr. of nakṣad-dābhá- in 2c, I now think that vs. 2
implies that Indra may deviously rebuff the attentions of his praisers and have done
so even to the legendary poets of the past. Here the poet directly asks the question if
these previous poets (/singers) actually obtained (ānaśúḥ) the favor they sought in
approaching (nakṣat-) Indra, whose benevolence cannot be taken for granted.
In the 2nd hemistich the questions turn to Indra’s portion (bhāgá-) and his vital
energy (váyaḥ) in battle, but also refers to the wealth he may bring. The two cmpds
púruhūta purūvaso respond to puruvī́rasya .. purukṣóḥ in 3d.
The voc. khidvaḥ, presumably to a -vant-stem *khídvant- (AiG II.2.896, or,
less likely, *khídvan- or *khidvāṃs-), belongs to the synchronic root √khid, which,
despite its relative rarity, displays a variety of senses centered around aggressive
action. Since this stem is a hapax, it’s difficult to know which of the senses is
reflected here; Gr renders as ‘drängend (so also EWA s.v. KHED), bedrängend, Ge
‘Abzwacker’. The only RVic nominal form to this root is khédā (3x), which in its
clearest occurrence (VIII.76.3) means ‘hammer’ or the like. I have evoked this sense
here, in the English idiom ‘hammer-head’, thus forming an unjustified etym. figure
in tr. “headstrong hammer-head” &ndash; ‘headstrong’ representing dudhra. Although the
standard tr. are safer, the fact that the form is a hapax to a poorly attested root invites
a more noticeable tr. than ‘pressing’.
I follow W. E. Hale (Ásura-, 65) in taking asura- in asurahán- as referring to
human ‘lords’ who lead forces inimical to us.</p>
<h3 id="vi225">VI.22.5</h3>
<p>This vs. is beset with difficulties, starting with the syntax, on which see Old.
The major problems are that there is no finite verb until iṣe in d and that it is unclear
what the limits are of the rel. cl. marked by yásya in b. If we follow Old’s first option,
that the rel. cl. occupies pādas a-c, the rel. prn. (towards the end of b) is positioned
far too deeply in the clause. His 3rd option envisions a discontinuous rel. cl. partly
embedded in and partly following the main cl., with the rel cl. verb being nákṣate in
d &ndash; a syntactic configuration that is simply impossible. His 2nd option, basically
adopted by Ge as well, takes the rel. cl. as limited to vépī vákvarī yásya nū́gī́ḥ. This
is more acceptable, though the rel. cl. would be definitely embedded, not only in the
main clause but within a long acc. NP (tám … índram [REL CL] tuvigrābhám …). My
own solution is similar to this, but limits the rel. cl. to yásya nū́gī́ḥ; this not only
better accounts for the position of the particle nū́but also diminishes the effect of the
embedding, because brief nominal rel. clauses, roughly equivalent to izafe
constructions, seem to be at least marginally acceptable in RVic syntax. See esp. yó
vídānaḥ in the previous hymn, VI.21.2. Scar’s (208) tr. appears to follow the same
analysis, with the rel. cl. limited to “[das Lied,] das nun ihm gehört …”
The root noun cmpd rabhodā́- is glossed by Scar (208) in the first instance as
‘Ungestüm, Gewalt, Kraft gebend, aufnehmend’, leaving it undetermined whether
Indra bestows or assumes rábhas-, a question that Scar discusses in some detail
without coming to a definite conclusion. Since, as Scar notes, there are several good
exx. of rábhas- and related words as objects of medial ā́√dā ‘take, assume’ (e.g.,
103
I.145.3) and since the pāda in which the adj. is found seems to depict Indra on a
rampage (tuvigrābháṃ tuvikūrmím “powerfully grasping, powerfully ranging”), the
medial ‘assume’ value makes the most sense. Although ideally we might want the
preverb ā́represented, root noun cmpds with the structure NOUN–PREV-√ seem to be
rare to non-existent. (Cmpds of the type tveṣá–saṃ-dṛś- in 9b below aren’t
counterexamples, because, as the accent shows, the root noun cmpd saṃdŕ̥ś- has
been in turn incorporated into a bahuvrīhi), and in any case the outcome of rabhas–ādā́- would be hard to parse once sandhi rules had applied.
The verb of the main clause must be iṣe in d, but what it represents is
uncertain. Gr (Nachtr., 1755) assigns it to √iṣ ‘send’, identifying it as a 1st sg.; Old tr.
as 3rd sg. ‘er regt sich … an’, which I assume means that he assigns it to √iṣ ‘send’,
though he doesn’t comment on either root affiliation or morphology. Ge suggests a
3rd sg. either to √i (built like stuṣe, acdg. to him, though stuṣe is overwhelmingly first
sg.) or to √iṣ (which √iṣ he doesn&rsquo;t say, though his tr. ‘sucht’ suggests √iṣ ‘seek’).
Lub gives iṣe as an independent lemma (p. 321), with a question mark, no gloss, and
4 occurrences. As my tr. ‘seeks’ indicates, I think it belongs to √iṣ ‘seek’ and is a 3rd
sg. A number of other forms to this root take gātúm ‘way’ as obj. (pres. ichá- I.80.6,
IV.18.10, VI.6.1; pf. īṣ- I.112.16, III.1.2). But what is the form? Almost the only way
to get a 3rd sg. in -e (outside of archaic forms like duhé) is in the perfect, and as we
just saw, other forms of the pf. of this root take the same object. I suggest that we do,
or did, have a pf. here, whose expected form would be *īṣe. This putative form with
heavy root syllable would in fact work metrically here. See also IV.23.6 and X.20.7,
where I suggest the same underlying form for the transmitted form with light root
vowel; the suggested long vowel is a significant metrical improvement in both
passages. (Lub’s 4th ex. in VIII.46.17 is better taken as part of a cmpd. áramiṣe.)
There are several ways to explain the short vowel. On the one hand, it can be
wrongly extracted from combinations with preverbs like upeṣé in I.129.8, whose
correct analysis is upa īṣé, but could also in principle contain *iṣé. On the other hand,
the dat. iṣé to the root noun íṣ- ‘refreshment’, found in nearby VI.13.2, 17.14, might
have influenced it. MLW suggests that it’s simply an archaic 3rd sg. middle pres., like
duhé just cited – which would cut the Gordian knot.
Stepping back from the formal difficulties of the vs., we can try to fit its
contents into the context of the hymn. The vs. seems to express the same questioning
anxiety as vs. 4: do the singers &ndash; and their song &ndash; succeed in reaching Indra and
attaining his good opinion, or does he respond to their approach with disdainful
tricks? While asking this question, the song seeks her way and approaches what
sounds like an intimidatingly formidable Indra, hoping for acceptance and favor.
That we have moved from the plural male poets/singers of vss. 2 and 4 to the lone
female song (fem. gī́ḥ) makes the mismatch of power all the clearer. The verb
nákṣate in the final clause brings us back to nakṣad-dābhá- in vs. 2.</p>

<p>Indra’s overwhelming power, viewed with some apprehension in the
previous vss., is a positive force when it is exercised for our benefit against external
foes, and the hymn now turns to this happier theme.

The publ. tr. assigns the instr. phrase ayā́… māyáyā “with this magic power”
to Indra, whereas Ge and Old assume that the phrase goes with vāvṛdhānám and
refers to Vṛtra’s māyā́; Old is in fact quite scornful of the former interpr. However,
see comm. ad nearby VI.18.9, where I argue that Indra is regularly credited with
māyā́in this Indra cycle. See, e.g., 1d in this hymn and 2d in the previous one
(VI.21.2), both with purumāyá- qualifying Indra. It is also the case that this hymn
contains hostile māyā́; see 9d. I therefore now think that māyayā́in this vs. has
double application. Its tight embedding in the acc. phrase tyám māyáyā vāvṛdhānám
does suggest that it belongs to Vṛtra, but the initial near-deictic ayā́, outside that NP,
refers, in my opinion, to “this (māyā́) right here” &ndash; namely Indra’s. I would therefore
amend the tr. to “With this (magic power of yours) right here … (you shattered) him
who had grown strong with his magic power.”
The identification of the vajra with “the mountain that has the speed of
thought” goes back to Sāy.
Though the first hemistich lacks a verb, it is easy enough to supply ‘shattered’
from rujó ví in the 2nd half-vs.</p>
<h3 id="vi227">VI.22.7</h3>
<p>The predicated inf. paritaṃsayádhyai has no clear subject, but vaḥ must
serve in this capacity, referring to the poets, who will perform this action with “their
newer insight” (dhiyā́návasyā). The model for this action is the previous poets
referred to in 2ab who praised and stimulated Indra, here represented by the
adverbial pratnavát ‘in the ancient way, as the ancients did’. The force of pari- in the
infinitive must be to indicate that poets from all competing groups will try to pull
Indra to their side.
Ge renders animāná- as ‘ohne Vorbild’ (pattern, model), but there seems to
be no support for this tr. The only occurrence of ní √mā that I know of in the RV is
in the enigmatic creation hymn III.38.7d ní … mamire, where it is paired with ā́…
mamire (7a), with both verbs referring to the ‘measuring out’ of creation and created
things. There is another occurrence of the negated adj. animāná- in I.27.11, but
nothing in that passage pushes the word to mean anything beyond ‘without measure’.</p>

<p>The lexeme ví dayate is often used positively, of distributing good things to
deserving people; cf., e.g., III.2.11 vásu rátnā dáyamāno ví dāśúṣe “distributing
goods and treasures to the pious man.” However, a few passages are, or can be,
negative, esp. III.34.1 dáyamāno ví śátrūn “fragmenting his rivals” (probably also
IV.7.10). Here the dominant sense must be negative and the wiles must be Vṛtra’s
(and perhaps those of other enemies) — though a positive spin is just possible as a
second reading: “distributing your magic wiles,” that is, deploying his own māyā-s
widely. See comm. ad VI.18.9 on Indra’s use of his māyā́-s in combat.</p>

The contrastive pair dā́śa- ā́rya-, juxtaposed in c, is a species of merism that

<p>The rendering of nímiśla- as ‘intertwined’ may be a bit over the top, but

point is that Indra can’t be separated from the substances and words offered to him in
the ritual.
The standard NP suté sóme is polarized at the boundaries of pāda a, allowing

<p>The gen. phrase dákṣasya bibhyúṣaḥ is troublesome, as it is not clear who or
what it refers to or what its syntactic function is. Old interpr. it as a “dativischer
Gen.,” though he gives no tr. But Ge seems to take it as a gen. absolute: “während
der Entschlossene Furcht hatte.” In either case dákṣa- seems to be taken as an adj.
qualifying a human and this fearful human is taken to be one on our side, aided either
directly (datival gen.) or indirectly (gen. abs.) by fearless Indra. In this passage the
single ‘skillful’ (or ‘determined’: Ge’s ‘entschlossen’) person would presumably be
the soma-presser (súṣvi-) of ab, and this is not impossible. However, although there
are a few undoubted exx. of adjectival dákṣa- ‘skillful’ (e.g., I.51.2 dákṣāsa ṛbhávaḥ),
in most clear exx. the stem is a masc. abstract ‘skill, abillity’, and in doubtful cases I
prefer to seek such a meaning. Here I suggest that the “fearful skill” belongs to
Indra’s enemies, the dásyūn of d, and depicts their fading confidence in their skill or
ability to counter Indra. Under this interpr. it can either be a gen. abs. with Ge
(though this construction is rare at any stage and is supposed not to exist before
Vedic prose; see Delbrück, AIS 389–90) or is a gen. of quality (although this
construction is also marginal) with dásyūn “the Dasyus of frightened skill.” The publ.
tr. represents an absolute interpr.; the gen. of quality might be a better analysis, but is
difficult to render in Engl., as the tr. just given shows (better “of daunted/craven
skill,” but this would lose the etymological figure). (Kü’s [336] tr. avoids the
problem, but unfortunately only by an unusual grammatical lapse on his part: he
explicitly identifies bibhyúṣaḥ as acc. pl., which it could be, but tr. the phrase
dákṣasya bibhyúṣaḥ as a single NP [“für den Geschickten die sich fürchtenden”]
apparently failing to remember that dákṣasya requires the whole phrase to be gen. sg.
He takes this supposed acc. pl. as parallel to śárdhataḥ, which he separates from
dásyūn and takes as another qualifier of those aided by Indra. His full tr. is “Oder
106
wenn du für den Geschickten die sich fürchtenden furchtlos unterwarfst für den
Kühnen, Indra, die Dasyus.” The misparsing of dákṣasya excludes this tr.)
VI.23.3–4: The alternation of root-accented -tar- agent nouns and redupl. agentive -
i-stems, both with verbal rection, is a distinctive characteristic of these two vss.</p>
<h3 id="vi235">VI.23.5</h3>
<p>The first pāda contains an example of an embedded relative that is difficult
to sidestep: in ásmai vayáṃ yád vāvā́na tád viviṣma the first two words dat. ásmai
and nom. vayám rightly belong to the main cl. tád viviṣma “we toil at that,” which
follows the dependent cl. yád vāvā́na “what he holds dear.” The two preposed
pronouns set the participants and case roles for the vs. (see esp. índrāya opening b
and d, as well as the two 1st pl. verbs viviṣma and stumasi) &ndash; hence my tr. as a cleft
construction &ndash; but the construction still seems unusual.
The opening of c, suté sóme stumasi, takes the same elements found in the
figure in vs. 1ab and plays on different phonological similarities. Here sut(é) and
stu(masi) are scrambled versions of each other, while sóme stands somewhat apart.</p>
<h3 id="vi236">VI.23.6</h3>
<p>The first hemistich can be interpr. as a rough repair of the problematic 5a:
what Indra holds dear (5a) are the formulations that he makes strengthening for
himself (6a), and this is what we have toiled for (6b), with viviṣmaḥ in a syntactically
more orthodox position than in 5a. (6a also of course is responsive to 5d.)
The phrase opening the 2nd hemistich, suté sóme sutapā́ḥ, echoes 5c, with
sut(apā́ḥ) an anagram of stu(masi).
The referent of the acc. pl. neut. adjs. in cd is unspecified; either the pressings
or the formulations &ndash; or, better, both &ndash; would work. Both are elsewhere qualified as
śáṃtama-: cf. VIII.33.15 sávanā santu śáṃtamā and V.73.10 imā́bráhmāṇi várdhanā
… santu śáṃtamā.
A rare ex. of variant readings, the hapax rā́ṇdya-/rā́ndrya- is unclear. Ge
refuses to tr. it. The publ. tr. ‘enjoyable’ (which should be marked with ?) rests on
Hoffmann’s suggestion (reported in EWA s.v. rā́ṇḍya-), deriving it from √raṇ (or
√ram). Certainty of course is impossible, but some such meaning fits the context.
vákṣana- in d serves as a synonymous substitute for várdhana- (5d, 6a).</p>

<p>As in III.41.6 (=VI.45.27) mandasvā is not accented despite following hí;
see comm. ad III.41.6. I have no explanation (nor does Old, despite his ref. to
himself). It can be noted that in all three passages the hí occurs in 3rd position, after
the verb (all three identically sá mandasvā hí), but this position is not sufficient to
explain the lack of accent, since hí elsewhere occurs after its accented verb (e.g.,
I.2.4 índavo vām uśánti hí# ; cf., e.g., I.105.18, 131.6, III.14.5, 26.8, VII.3.3, 23.5,
59.5, VIII.21.18, IX.85.2, X.30.12, 34.11). Note esp. I.189.6, IX.49.4, X.68.7, where
hí is in 3rd position after the verb as here. Since hí often appears after initial accented
verbs &ndash; for 2nd sg. med. impvs. like mandasvā see the numerous exx. of #yukṣvā́hí
107
(I.10.3, etc.) &ndash; it might be possible to construct a scenario wherein when such an
impv. is displaced from initial position by the pronoun sá, it loses its accent by some
sort of syntactic analogy. But I find this unlikely: RVic poets are quite sensitive to
their accent rules.
Pāda c lacks a verb, but the close parallelism of b and c (prá […] imé) and the
semantic connection of the two nom. pl.s yajñā́saḥ and hávāsaḥ impose aśnuvantu
from b.
In c the 1st pl. prn. asmé, which could be either dat. or loc., doesn’t work very
well as either. Ge tr. “von uns,” which makes contextual sense but ill fits either
possible case form. The publ. tr. takes it as loc., though the tr. is awkward.
I don’t know why the modal temperature has been raised, as it were, by
precative yamyāḥ in d &ndash; though it is the case that there are no 3rd sg. root aor. impvs.
attested to √yam, perhaps because a putative *yaṃtu or *yantu would coincide with
the much more common 3rd pl. root pres. impv. to √i ‘go’.</p>
<h3 id="vi239">VI.23.9</h3>
<p>Once again a dependent clause seems to follow fronted portions of the main
clause, in this case táṃ vaḥ sakhāyaḥ. (Although vaḥ sakhāyaḥ could belong
semantically in the dependent clause, their lack of accent requires them to follow
along with tám, or so it seems to me.) As in 5a the fronted material seems to establish
the participants in the rest of hemistich: the god and the worshipers. The acc. tám is
then doubled by both īm and the real referent índram in the main clause of b.
The foregoing assumes that the ellipsis of the verb in pāda a is not to be filled
with a verb that could take tám as object or goal. I have in fact tried to find such a
verb that an audience would supply when confronted with sám … sutéṣu, but I have
not been able to come up with a plausible one. The most likely verb to supply is √as,
esp. given 5d yáthā́sat, 9c ásati, and 10c ásad yáthā. Ge supplies “sich ergötze,”
presumably a form of √mad or √mand, which would work contextually. But there is
no positive evidence for this conjecture (unlike the three subjunctive forms of √as
with yáthā just cited), and both roots are only marginally construed with sám.</p>
<h3 id="vi2310">VI.23.10</h3>
<p>I would slightly change the tr. of the loc. absol. to ‘has been pressed’ or
‘was pressed’ to accord better with the immediate past of the hymn-summary verb
astāvi.
Klein (DGRV I.442–43) interpr. maghónaḥ as acc. pl. (“the liberal ones”),
which it could be morphologically, but √kṣi ‘rule over’ always takes the gen. (Gr
gives one passage with supposed acc., V.37.4, but it belongs to the etymologically
separate root √kṣi ‘dwell’, and in any case in that passage I do not construe the acc.
with that verb.)
The utá in c is troubling: it does not seem to conjoin anything and it seems
randomly positioned in the pāda. Klein groups it with a small set of passages where
he thinks utá means ‘(and) also, as well’, and he suggests that it focuses on the
immediately preceding word jaritré ‘singer’, who will also receive patronage from
Indra, in addition to the soma-presser in 9d. I find this unpersuasive, though I don’t
have an altogether better solution. One possibility is that we should supply the nom.
108
sg. corresponding to gen. sg. maghónaḥ of b, namely *maghávā, and utá would
conjoin this supplied noun with sūríḥ. This would change the tr. to “so that he will be
(liberal [/a benefactor]) and a patron to the singer.” A slightly different solution, but
still with the supplied *maghávā, would be to take utá as starting a new clause, with
sūríḥ qualifying Indra, yielding a tr. “so that he [=the liberal mortal of b] will be
(liberal) to the singer, and Indra (will be) a patron and giver of wealth …” Indra is
called a sūrí- in this Indra cycle (VI.29.5=37.5) and elsewhere. This second
suggestion is probably less disruptive to the syntax than the first one, but I weakly
favor the first because sūrí- is more often used of human patrons than of gods.</p>

<h3 id="vi241">VI.24.1</h3>
<p>In the publ. tr. ślóka- is rendered as ‘noise’, but I would now alter that to the
sense I usually give that word, ‘signal call’ (see comm. ad I.51.12) &ndash; namely the
noise that emanates from the sacrifice, often made by the pressing stones, to alert the
gods that the sacrifice is underway. Of course, it is possible here that it refers to more
general noise (as in the Engl. expression “joyful noise”) associated with the sacrifice.
In the publ. tr. I give full lexical value to the expression sácā sómeṣu as “when
the soma juices are in his company.” This is certainly possible, but, as noted in the
comm. ad IV.31.5, sácā with loc. often lacks lexical value and simply signals an
absolute (or absolute-like) construction. Here I might substitute the tr. “when the
soma juices (are pressed).”
Ge seems to take nṛ́bhyaḥ as a beneficial dat. (“für die Männer”), but it is
more likely that it is an agent with the gerundive, since such formations do take dat.
agents. (See my “Case of Agent …”) It is possible, however, that I’ve misinterpreted
his tr. “… ist er … für die Männer zu preisen,” and it’s actually the equivalent of an
English “for … to” construction (“for the men to praise”), which would give it
agentive value.</p>
<h3 id="vi242">VI.24.2</h3>
<p>The bahuvrīhi urvyū̀tiḥ, matching 1d ákṣitotiḥ at pāda end, is
morphologically problematic. It must be read as a quadrisyllable, and, further, the 2nd
vowel must be short (urvĭ(y)-ūtiḥ) in the Triṣṭubh cadence. (The Pp. reads urví ’ūtiḥ.)
Old simply remarks of it that the expected form *urú-ūtiḥ “wäre phonetisch
unbequem,” which is perfectly true but doesn’t account for the form. There are
several different analyses of it in the lit. Wack (AiG II.1.52 [also 274], flg.
Johannson 1897) assumes that it represents *urvī́+ūti- with the fem. form of the adj.
urú- as 1st member compounded with a fem. 2nd member. He does not mention that
the form has to be metrically distracted, much less that the distracted vowel must be
read short. Of course, the prevocalic outcome of -ī (&lt;*iH) would likely be -ĭ(y) as
here. But the real problem is that there seem to be no other good Vedic examples of
the type of cmpd envisioned, with a derived fem. adj. stem as first member showing
gender agreement with the 2nd; the cmpds uru-kṣití- and urú-gavyūti- with the stem
form of the adj. as 1st member even when cmpded with a fem. -ti-stem, provide
counterexamples. (Wack could argue that the fem. was used in our case for metrical
109
convenience; but without a grammatical model for this kind of compounding, it
seems difficult to imagine a Vedic poet inventing this type even to rescue his
cadence.) By contrast Lanman (Noun Inflection, pp. 380–81, esp. 381 B.4c) suggests
that the first member represents the older fem. instr. in -ī, shortened to -i. (Actually
he thinks -ī is a “contracted” form of -iā, but that aspect of his view is not relevant
here.) Although there is more precedent for the instr. sg. than for a fem. stem-form as
first cmpd. member, at least with archaic personal pronominal stems (type yuṣmā́-
datta- ‘given by you’), the problem here is that there is no functional reason to have
an instr.: the cmpd. must mean ‘having broad/wide-ranging help’, not ‘having help
with a broad [fem.] X’. Lanman’s solution is found, in a slightly different package, in
BR and is reproduced by Gr (though dismissed by Wack). The BR lemma contains
the lapidary “urviyā + ūti,” expanded a bit by Gr to “urvī́= urviyā́, I. f. von urú.”
Although I think the purport of these formulations is the same as Lanman’s, the
invocation of urviyā́allows us to pursue a different path: to take urvi- as truncated
from the adverbial urviyā́, orig. of course the long instr. of fem. urvī́- but only used
as an adverb. Although the fem. instr. is still the ultimate source, it would be possible
for the poet to perceive urvi- in urviyā́as a base form to which the instr./adverbial
ending had been affixed and therefore available for compounding. I would also
tentatively put forth yet a different, though related, analysis: that urví- preserves in
altered form the old Caland compound-forming -i-. The derived u-adj. urú- should
substitute this -i- when compounded, yielding *ur-i- (of the type ṛji- ‘silvery’, Aves.
bǝrǝzi- ‘lofty’). This *ur-i- of course never appears, but I would suggest that urvímay indirectly contain it, grafted onto the adj. stem urú-, encouraged by the
independent adv. urviyā́.
The phrase śáṃso narā́m is a reordered variant of narā́ṃ (ná) śáṃsa-, on
which see comm. ad II.34.6. Here I interpr. it as I do the similar phrase śáṃsam āyóḥ
(IV.6.11, V.3.4) “Laud of Āyu,” as referring to the god as a sort of embodiment of
the praise he receives. As I point out in the comm. ad IV.6.11, it is rather like
referring to someone as “the toast of the town” or perhaps “the talk of the town” &ndash;
both of which English expressions are quite peculiar when considered literally.
On dāti as a root aor. subj., see comm. ad IV.8.3. Here it would be better
rendered ‘he will give’.</p>
<h3 id="vi243">VI.24.3</h3>
<p>The ‘help’ (ūtí-) found in the first two vss. (ákṣitotiḥ 1d, urvyū̀tiḥ 2b) recurs
here uncompounded. The forms of help “have grown outward” (vy ū̀táyo ruruhuḥ) in
d, an image that expands on urvyū̀tiḥ ‘having broad help’ in 2b.
Despite Old’s detailed disc. of the first hemistich, in which he takes bṛhán
with ákṣaḥ as “the lofty axle,” I am persuaded instead by Ge’s interpr. Citing the
nearby passage VI.21.2 … áti mahnā́… riricé mahitvám, where Indra’s greatness
(nom. mahitvám) projects beyond the two worlds in/with their greatness (instr.
mahnā́), he supplies synonymous nom. mahimā́here as well, referring to Indra’s
greatness, with instr. mahnā́belonging to the two worlds as in VI.21.2. Although te is
adjacent to mahnā́, it has been independently positioned by Wackernagel’s Law and
need not limit the following instr. Ge presumably chose to supply mahimā́rather than
110
the mahitvám in VI.21.2 because we need a masc. here, given masc. bṛhán, but it also
works better because mahnā́also belongs to this -mán-stem.</p>
<h3 id="vi244">VI.24.4</h3>
<p>The vs. begins and ends with pādas containing triple etymological figures:
a: śácīvatas te puruśāka śā́kāḥ and d: dā́manvanto adāmā́naḥ sudāman. The effect
seems clumsily heavy, but it is quite possible that I’m missing something. At least in
the 2nd case, sudāman is a pun uniting two roots √dā ‘bind’ and ‘give’. It is possible
that there is a buried pun also in pāda a. The previous vs. compared Indra’s aid to the
branches of a tree (vṛkṣásya … vayā́ḥ); another word for ‘branch’ is śākhā-, which is
phonologically close to the śāk- forms. Perhaps the poet is punning off this
unexpressed synonym.
Old is insistent that srutí- should be read *sṛtí- here and in most other
instances in the RV (see his comm. ad I.42.3). I don’t understand his reasons and
stick with the transmitted reading.
The imagery in pāda b is complex. In its other occurrence (I.56.2=IV.55.6)
saṃcáraṇa- is used of the converging of rivers into the sea. Here the word srutáyaḥ
‘streams’ maintains the flowing imagery (another reason to keep the reading, pace
Old [see immed. above]; see also 6a), but they are streams of cows, not of water, and
this phrase (“converging like streams of cattle”) is a simile, where the comparandum
is Indra’s abilities. But in what way do Indra’s abilities flow? On what are they
converging? Indra himself? or, more likely, the lucky mortal recipients of his aid?
The simile in the 2nd hemistich, “like cords for calves,” likewise applying to
Indra’s abilities, is also opaque. Ge cites the dharmasūtra cmpd vatsa-tantī- (ĀpDS
I.31.13, GDS IX.52), but though apposite, it is not helpful. The passages in question
simply state that a snātaka should not step over a vatsa-tantī. Without knowing more
about the details of Vedic animal husbandry, we cannot get too far, but I assume &ndash;
based on “binding without bonds” &ndash; that calves were kept under control with very
gentle ropes or perhaps by means other than tying. But why should these gentle
measures be compared to Indra’s abilities?</p>
<h3 id="vi245">VI.24.5</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. of this vs. differs in a number of respects from the standard
interpr. In particular, in the first hemistich, flg. an interpr. of JPB’s, the two pairs
anyád adyá kárvaraṃ anyád u sváḥ “one deed today and another tomorrow” and ásac
ca sát “non-existent and existent” are taken as a chiastic square, with anyád adyá
matching sát and anyád u sváḥ matching ásat. In other words the deed Indra does
today is existent, while the one he will do tomorrow is (as yet) non-existent. The
standard interpr. takes ásat ca sát as an expression of process: Indra makes each deed
(the one today, the one tomorrow) that was as yet non-existent into an existent one
(so Ge “&hellip; macht Indra das Unwirkliche alsbald wirklich”). This does seem a
possible interpr., and I would suggest an alternative tr. “One deed today and another
tomorrow &ndash; Indra makes the not (yet) existent (deed) existent.” Klein (DGRV I.170,
II.24) takes ásac ca sát as “the bad and the good,” which deviates from the usual
sense esp. of the former and breaks the thematic connection with the first pāda:
111
“(Performing) one deed today and another tomorrow, Indra turns hither immediately
the bad and the good.”
In the 2nd hemistich the standard interpr. takes Mitra, Varuṇa, and Pūṣan as
the individualized seriatim singular subjects of paryetā́sti (=paryetā́asti), as in Ge’s
“Mitra und Varuṇa und Pūṣan kommen uns dabei dem Wunsche des Nebenbuhlers
zuvor.” (Tichy [-tar-stems, 188] follows Ge’s syntactic template, but with an aberrant
interpr. of pári √i.) As Ge’s blithe disregard of the sg. verb shows, the triple subject
is somewhat awkward given sg. asti (though singular verbs with a series of singular
subjects are indeed found). But there are several other problematic aspects to this
strain of interpr. On the syntactic level, it is surprising to find asti in a main clause if
its function is simply copular (“M, V, and P is/are parietā́”); asti in main clauses is
almost always existential. On the thematic level, these other gods are intrusive in the
hymn &ndash; the focus so far has been entirely on Indra &ndash; and it seems odd suddenly to
credit these gods with the power to effect a desirable thing for us, when Indra has
been performing the heavy lifting all along. I therefore think that Thieme (Fremdling,
53) is correct in taking Indra as the unexpressed subject of parietā́asti, though he
doesn’t discuss the passage or, rather disingenuously, even quote the preceding pāda
with the other possible subjects. Given these factors, I think that asti is implicitly
contrastive and emphatic: the other gods are there for us in some sense, but it’s Indra
who … As for the sense of paryetā́and pári √i in general, the literal meaning is ‘go
around’, hence ‘encompass’ and hence to contain and control, a sense that works
very well here.</p>
<h3 id="vi246">VI.24.6</h3>
<p>The simile in pāda a makes explicit the flowing water implicit in 4b (see
disc. above). But it is not clear what the waters are being compared to. Old suggests
Schätze and Segnungen, with various rather vague parallels suggested. I find Ge’s
citation of nearby VI.34.1 more to the point. Pāda b of that vs. reads ví ca tvád yanti
vibhvò manīṣā́ḥ “Out from you go inspired thoughts far and wide.” Although Indra is
generally viewed as the goal and recipient of poetic thoughts and praises, he is also,
as Ge says in his n. 6ab to our passage, “der Aufgangspunkt der Dichtkunst und des
Kultus.” Here we can supply as subject and comparandum the ‘inspired thoughts’
(manīṣā́ḥ) of 34.1 or some similar reference to poetic production. The more
conventional view of Indra as poetic goal is expressed in the 2nd hemistich, which
roughly corresponds to VI.34.1a sáṃ ca tvé jagmúr gíra indra pūrvī́ḥ “Many songs
have converged on you, Indra.”
The verb (ví) … anayanta is a bit troubling because even the rare medial
forms of the overwhelmingly active pres. náya(ti) are otherwise transitive. Cf., e.g.,
V.45.10 udnā́ná nā́vam anayanta dhī́rāḥ “Like a boat through the water the wise
ones guided (him).” I see no choice but to assume that this form has acquired a nonce
intrans. sense because of its middle voice.</p>
<h3 id="vi247">VI.24.7</h3>
<p>The distribution of the three measures of time vis-à-vis the two verbs járanti
and avakarśáyanti cannot be determined for certain, nor does it really matter. The
pāda boundary favors keeping mā́śāḥ with śarádaḥ (“whom neither the autumns nor
112
the months age, nor the days make lean”), but the position of the various ná-s might
favor bracketing mā́sāḥ with dyā́vaḥ. This is how Ge tr., and I have followed suit,
though I don’t feel strongly one way or the other.</p>
<h3 id="vi248">VI.24.8</h3>
<p>stavā́n is an intractable form, found also in II.19.5, 20.5. In all three cases it
is found in this same, apparently nom. sg., form, referring to Indra, and with the
likely value ‘being praised, having/receiving praise’. In all three cases it also occurs
at the end of a Triṣṭubh pāda, which suggests that the root syllable should be heavy
(*stāvā́n) &ndash; though Old (ad II.19.5) does not regard this as a problem. Old discusses
the form in great detail ad II.19.5 without reaching a firm conclusion; see also
KEWA III.521, with listing of the lit. but again no conclusions. Assuming that the
form belongs to √stu ‘praise’ (other proposed root affiliations are properly dismissed
by Old), there are two main strains of explanation: as a truncation or as a haplology.
Several different underlying forms have been suggested for the truncation; the least
problematic is Pischel’s suggested pres. mid. part. stavānáḥ (1x; versus fairly
common stávāna-). But least problematic doesn’t mean unproblematic: lopping off
inflectional endings isn’t a practice we find elsewhere in the RV, esp. when it leaves
an unanalysable form, and we might expect the accent to follow that of the common
root-accented participle. The haplology explanation (owing ultimately to Johansson,
who was responsible for one of the explanations of urvyū̀tiḥ above, vs. 2) has found
more general acceptance (see AiG I.Nachtr. 161, though cf. Mayrhofer’s lack of
enthusiasm in KEWA, cited above) &ndash; that it is derived from a -vant-stem, nom. sg.
*stava-vā́n, with haplologic loss of the medial syllable. Old raises several objections
to this: first, that the accent is wrong. The accent of -vant-stems is overwhelmingly
that of the base noun; if the putative stem was formed to stáva- ‘praise’, it should
have yielded <em>stá(va)vān. Old’s 2nd objection has to do with this base form: that
stáva- is found only once in the RV. I tentatively advance a different explanation
from either of the prevailing ones, that it is formed with a Hoffmann suffix (</em>-Hon-/
-Hn-), to the just mentioned stáva- ‘praise’, hence ‘having praise’. This would
produce the attested long vowel; moreover, insofar as we can tell, the Hoffmann
suffix attracts the accent. See somā́n- ‘having soma’ (based on root-accented sóma-)
and discussion ad I.18.1. Of course, the rarity of the base form stáva- is a problem
here, as it was for the -vant-stem explanation just presented, but perhaps because the
Hoffmann suffix was not synchronically productive and therefore our stavā́n should
be an old form, this rarity is less problematic than for the productive -vant-stems. It
might also be possible to posit a long-vowel base *stāva- (cf. fem. stāvā́- VS
XVIII.42), with expected Brugmann’s Law outcome for a standard *o-grade thematic
noun, producing *stāvā́n. Though, once the formation of *stāvā́n was no longer
understood, this vṛddhi would have been eliminated in the transmitted text in favor of
the guṇa prevailing in the verbal forms, it would still be reflected in the heavy
syllable called for by the cadential pattern.</p>
<h3 id="vi249">VI.24.9</h3>

In b sutapāvan reprises sutapā́(ḥ) in 1b.
vyùṣṭau (/-iṣu) almost always occurs with dependent uṣásaḥ &ndash; “at the early
brightening of the dawn” &ndash; and of course is derived from the same root √vas ‘dawn’
as uṣás-. Here we find the apparent opposite: aktór vyùṣṭau “at the early brightening
of the night”; despite the anonymity of the genitives, I think the two expressions refer
to the same time period, the moment when the deep darkness of night begins to lift.
This can be considered as brightening either of the night or of the dawn. On the
almost identical expression in V.30.13 and its morphological twist, see comm. ad loc.</p>
<h2 id="vi25-indra">VI.25 Indra</h2>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the hymn has an omphalos shape, with vs. 5 the
omphalos, surrounded by matched vss. 4 and 6. Although vss. 3 and 7 do not show
similar matchings, there is some repeated phraseology between vss. 1/2 and 8/9:
vrtrahátye ̥ 1c, 8b; spṛ́dhaḥ (&hellip;) mithatī́ḥ 2a, 9ab.
VI.25.1–2: On avīḥ (1c) and áva tārīḥ (2d) as “hortativ,” see Hoffmann Injunk. 264.</p>
<h3 id="vi251">VI.25.1</h3>
<p>That avīḥ of c is also the verb of d is suggested by passages like I.110.9
vā́jebhir no vā́jasātau aviḍḍhi, VIII.46.11 dhíyo vā́jebhir āvitha with √av and an instr.
of vā́ja- ‘prize’.</p>
<h3 id="vi252">VI.25.2</h3>
<p>Ge supplies the verb ‘drive’ in c (“Mit diesen (treib) alle Angriffe
auseinander”), but I see no reason why it can’t be in the orbit of d. In vs. 1 the two
pādas cd share a single verb (avīḥ c), as do the first two pādas of this vs. (vyathayā).
With this pattern established, it seems reasonable to take áva tārīḥ in d as also
governing the accusatives of c. Under this interpr., I take víṣūcīḥ as proleptic, rather
like 3d kṛṇuhī́párācaḥ “put them far away.”</p>
<h3 id="vi253">VI.25.3</h3>
<p>Pāda c lacks a verb to govern the acc. vithurā́śávāṃsi. On the model of 1cd,
2ab, and 2cd, we might simply deploy the (first) verb of d, jahí, across the pāda
boundary: “smash their faltering powers” or, with proleptic adj., “smash their powers
(to be) faltering.” However, vithurā́is derived from the root √vyath ‘falter’, whose
causative supplied the verb in 2ab, vyathayā. I therefore think there’s a different kind
of trick here: the poet expects us to supply the CAUSATIVE feature of the verb in 2b
with the lexical feature of that verb contained in the adj. vithurā́&ndash; hence my tr.
“(render) their powers faltering.”</p>
<h3 id="vi254">VI.25.4</h3>
<p>tanūrúc- is, of course, a root noun cmpd., ‘shining with/in their bodies’, but
the bahuvrīhi-like tr. works better in context.
kṛṇvaíte is clearly meant as a 3rd du. mid. subjunctive to the 5th cl. pres. of √kṛ,
but it has the wrong grade of the suffix: we expect *kṛnávaite (cf. 2nd du. mid.
aśnávaithe [VII.70.4]). It clearly simply anticipates the root pres. 3rd du. mid.
brávaite, which ends the next hemistich (4d). This imitation comes at a metrical cost:
the heavy root syllable kṛṇv produces a bad Triṣṭubh cadence. (The grammatically
114
correct form would also, of course, be metrically problematic.) A root aor. subj.
*karaite would fit the meter better, but there’s no warrant for emendation. For a
passage in which the poet simply avoids the middle dual subjunctive of √kṛ
altogether by substituting a plural, see comm. ad I.178.2.
The locative string in cd is the usual expression of the stakes &ndash; a type of loc.
absol. lacking an overt participle. The full expression is dháne hité “when the stake is
set” (VI.45.11, 13, etc.). The string here contains a formulaic pair, toké … tánaye
“progeny and prosperity” with three other locc., one inserted inside the formula. On
the basis of VI.31.1 (q.v.), where a ca after tánaye better delineates the pairing, I
would slightly change the tr. to “when progeny and prosperity [or, offspring and
lineage], cattle, water, and fields are at stake.”
The two vā-s (4a, 4c), in conjunction with the subjunctives, seem to set out a
deliberative choice: “it may be that X … or it may be that Y.” The two possibilities
floated as to how one champion might defeat another set the stage for the next vs. (5),
which forecloses any possibility that one of the champions, even a successful one,
could take on Indra. The two vā-s are slightly off-balance, however, since the first
one is located in the main clause (a) to which the first yád clause is immediately
appended (b), while the second is found in the second yád clause, whose main clause
seems to be, by default, the original pāda a. This seems to me a minor problem: the
point is that the two champions (śū́ra-) in pāda a may defeat each other in single
combat (b) or in a full-on battle (cd). The first vā would be better positioned in pāda
b, but it has been shifted to the front of the whole main-cl./dep.-cl. construction &ndash; a
sort of super-Wackernagel’s Law position. Klein (DGRV II.194, 201–2) treats the
two vā occurrences separately, taking the 2nd as conjoining (or disjoining) the parallel
yád clauses b and c, but the 1st as the equivalent of “the asseverative particle vaí.”
This seems somewhat perverse to me: two occurrences of the same particle in a
single verse, esp. a particle that regularly appears in pairs, invite a unified
explanation; moreover, I am very dubious that vā is ever used for vaí, a particle that
is rare in the RV anyway. Even Klein can only identify 6 passages where he thinks
vā = vaí (DGRV II.201), of which he finds syntactic support for only 3. That 6c
contains a pair of vā-s whose syntactic connection is clearer provides evidence that
these two vā-s also form a pair.
VI.25.6–8: Each of these vss. contains at least one derivative of nṛ́- ‘(superior) man’:
6a nṛmṇám, 6c nṛváti, 7c nṛ́tamāsaḥ, 8d nṛṣáhye.</p>
<h3 id="vi256">VI.25.6</h3>
<p>By my analysis this vs. matches 4 in structure and in referents, forming with
4 a ring around the omphalos vs. 5. In the first pāda the unspecified pair (ubháyoḥ …
ayóḥ “of both of these”) refers, in my view (as also, apparently, Ge), to the two
krándasī (lit. ‘war-cries’, viz., opposing forces) of 4d; Indra has mastery over the
manly power of both of them, as vs. 5 has already implied. The verb of 6b, hávante,
doubles brávaite in 4d semantically; both refer to verbal appeals to Indra for help in
battle. The two forces referred to in an oblique case in pāda a return as subject in
pāda d, with yet another 3rd du. med. subjunctive, vitantasaíte.
115
Pace Ge, who gives them different roles, the locc. in c are parallel and match
those of 4c, expressing what is at stake in the battle. Although it might seem odd to
name a vṛtrá- as a stake, I think the point is that the battle may be about confronting
an obstacle or about acquiring a rich dwelling place. Klein’s tr. (DGRV II.159)
“when they battle each other in the (struggle with the) obstacle or in (the struggle
for) great dwelling space rich in heroes” reflects the same view. See Schaeffer
(Intens. 126–27) for detailed disc. A similar use of vṛtréṣu is found in the next hymn
(VI.26.2), where it is implicitly parallel to góṣu, an expression for the stakes.
I take the subordinator yádī in b as representing yád + ī (‘when’ + acc.
particle) (as described pp. 305–9 in my 2002 article “Rigvedic sīm and īm), rather
than conditional yádi ‘if’. All that needs to be done is to insert a notional word space
between yád and ī. The pāda could use an overt acc. (ī ‘him’, as obj. of hávante), and
‘if’ does not make sense.
The publ. tr. implicitly reflects a similar analysis of yádi in d, but I now think
that interpr. is probably incorrect. In favor of it is the parallelism with the matched vs.
4, which contains two parallel yád clauses. But several factors, both formal and
functional, weigh against it: the final i of yádi is short and does not occur before a
cons. cluster, which elsewhere facilitates the shortening of the particle ī. Moreover,
an acc. referent is not necessary to the clause, since the verb is a reciprocal middle
(though see I.131.3, also with med. ví √taṃs, ví tvā tatasre “They have tussled over
you,” a passage that also contains a loc. of the stakes). The publ. tr. also renders the
subjunctive vitantasaíte as an indicative. I now think that the conditional yádi and the
subjunctive contribute to the same semantic effect. For a full revised tr. see below.
On the assumption that cd forms a single dependent clause (as it does in the
publ. tr. and in Ge), the yádi is too deep in the clause, following not only the nom. du.
adj. vyácasvantā that opens pāda d but also the complex loc. phrase that occupies
pāda c. This problem could be easily remedied by connecting c with b, rather than
with d, leaving yádi in standard 2nd position in a clause now consisting only of d. The
only obstacle to that reassignment is my interpr. of maháḥ, which in the publ. tr. I
take as a sentential adverb and construe with vitantasaíte (“… keep tussling
mightily”). However, that interpr. is quite fragile, esp. because of the position of
maháḥ, and I am happy to abandon it, though I do not have a particularly good
alternative suggestion. Schaeffer (Intens. 128) first suggests that it is an adverb, with
adjectival aspirations (not her phrase), construed with the following phrase nṛváti
kṣáye, in the manner of Old’s (ZDMG 55 [1901]: 270–71) interpr. of mahó rāyé
“mächtiglich zu Reichtum” à “zu mächtigem Reichtum” &ndash; in this instance
“mächtiglich männerreiches Land” à “grosses männerreiches Land.” Alternatively
she suggests it could be an acc. pl. with gapped devā́n as a goal or obj. of vitantasaíte
(“sooft die zwei … (Völkerschaften) die Grossen (Götter) angehen …”). This second
suggestion seems quite implausible, but the first one is possible, in the absence of
anything better. In any event, it is essentially the interpr. given by Ge (“um einen
grossen männerreichen Wohnsitz”), however he arrived at it. (Judging from his n.
6cd it rests on Sāy.’s high-handed glossing of maho with loc. mahati.) Klein’s tr.
116
“great dwelling space rich in heroes” (see above) simply follows Ge and also shows a
quasi-adj. interpr. of maháḥ.
Putting all this together, I offer the revised translation:
“He is master of the manly power of both of these (armies) when the ritual
adepts call on him in the clash,
whether an obstacle or a dwelling place rich in men is at issue — if the two
(armies) in their expansion will keep tussling mightily back and forth with one
another.”</p>
<h3 id="vi257">VI.25.7</h3>
<p>As usual, aryáḥ has a number of possible interpr. Ge takes it as nom. pl.
identical to the sūráyaḥ in d. Old suggests either acc. pl. or abl. sg. without choosing
one. Thieme (Fremdling, 73–74) opts for the abl. sg., which he construes (as does
Old) with the splv. nṛ́tamāsaḥ: “… als unsere, im Vergleich zum Fremdling sehr
heldenhaften Schutzherren …” But of course an ablative with a superlative would be
highly unusual (though Old offers a single parallel and a ref. to Delbrück’s Vgl.
Syn.). I also take it as an abl., but suggest construing it with puráḥ. I now see that this
is also problematic, since it is not clear that puráḥ ever takes the abl. Gr gives two
exx.: but in IV.7.9 the supposed abl. is a gen. and construed elsewhere; in III.53.23
the form in question (áśvān) could be either an abl. sg. or an acc. pl. in sandhi.
Nonetheless I hold to this interpr. Although puráḥ + ABL is not a robust construction,
the related purā́is regularly found with the abl. Here I would suggest that we have a
sort of pun. The lexeme puráḥ + √dhā ‘set in front, install’ is of course very common,
and that phrase is found here, dadhiré puró naḥ. Although, as I just said, to express
“ahead of / in front of the stranger” we might expect aryáḥ [abl.] … purā́, there was
interference with the VP dadhiré puró naḥ “they have set us in front,” and puráḥ
prevailed.</p>
<h3 id="vi258">VI.25.8</h3>
<p>The HvN ed. resolves the contraction across pāda boundary of yajatréndra
as yajatrā́índra. This must be a careless error, since the Pp. has yajatra índra, and
the stem yájatra- has root accent.</p>
<h3 id="vi259">VI.25.9</h3>
<p>Pāda c = I.177.5c and X.89.17c. Ge (fld. by Klein, DGRV I.458) construes
vástoḥ with vidyā́ma (“Möchten wir Sänger … den neuen Tag erleben”), but wellattested vástoḥ is otherwise a temporal expression ‘at dawn, in the morning’. In both
the other passages, the pāda in question is adjoined by a pāda that likewise begins
vidyā́ma (following in I.177.5, preceding in X.89.17), and the obj. of that vidyā́ma
can be assumed with the one in the repeated pāda. The d pāda of X.89.17 is almost
identical to d here, with the substitution of a different poetic family: viśvā́mitrāḥ for
our bharádvājāḥ.
The function and position of utá in d are unclear. The publ. tr. implicitly
assumes that it loosely connects the 2nd hemistich with the 1st (“And with your help
…”), but locating this clausal conjunction in 2nd position of the 2nd pāda of what it’s
conjoining would be an irrational poetic strategy. I now think it likely that it conjoins
the temporal expressions vástoḥ and nūnám, and I would alter the tr. to “With your
117
help … might we Bharadvājas know (this), as we sing at dawn and also now” (or
“might we know (this) at dawn and also now, as we sing”). The curiosity then is the
position of te, which can only belong to something in the preceding pāda: either
“with your help” (as I take it in the publ. tr.) or “as we sing to you.” I suppose that
utá’s strong tendency to take 1st position makes it a natural host for enclitics even
when it is not so located, but it really seems odd that it would sweep te up and away
from the elements it should be limiting.</p>

<p>On the various stylistic tics of this hymn, see publ. intro.
VI.26.1–2: As noted in the publ. intro., the 1st two vss. play on the word vā́ja-,
presumably as a reference to the Bharadvāja bardic line: 1b, 2b mahó vā́jasya, 2a vājī́
… vājineyáḥ.</p>
<h3 id="vi261">VI.26.1</h3>
<p>On vāvṛṣāṇā́ḥ, see comm. ad VIII.61.7 on úd vāvṛṣasva.</p>
<h3 id="vi262">VI.26.2</h3>
<p>The hapax vājineyáḥ is somewhat surprising, because the -eyá-suffix
generally builds metronymics (AiG II.2.505–11), and so it should mean ‘son of a
female prize-winner / of a prize-winning mare’ &ndash; a feminine connection that would
be particularly surprising if it’s meant as a reference to the Bharadvāja family.
Although I don’t have a good explanation, I do think the intrusion of this marked
suffix, fairly rare in the RV, should be taken serious, and if vājineyá- is derived from
the vājínī- (found in vājínī-vant- and vājínī-vasu-) (cf. AiG II.2.507 for this
possibility), this provides another support for my contention that vājínī- has real fem.
reference, and its -ī- is not simply an Erweiterung (pace Debrunner, AiG II.2.409).
See disc. ad I.48.6.
Since pāda c lacks a main verb, it could belong either with ab or with d. Ge
takes it with ab, seeming to refer to VI.46.1 as a parallel, and the publ. tr. follows suit.
On the basis of VI.25.6c with contrastive locatives of the stake, one of which is vṛtré
(see comm. immed. above), I am now inclined to reassign it to d, with vṛtréṣu (c) and
góṣu (d) the stakes. The revised tr. would be “… secured; to you … when obstacles
(are at stake), to you when cows (are at stake) does the fistfighter look as he fights.”
VI.26.3–6: These vss. are tr. and discussed by Hoffman (Injunk., 183–84).</p>
<h3 id="vi263">VI.26.3</h3>
<p>As discussed ad VI.20.4, the three occurrences of arká-sāti- ‘the winning of
the sun’s rays’ (I.174.7, VI.20.4, and here) are all found in conjunction with a poet
(kaví-) and in connection with the Kutsa / Śuṣṇa myth. These associations point fairly
decisively to Uśanā Kāvya as the poet in question.
Pāda b contains one of the few occurrences of √vṛj ‘twist, wring’ without
preverb; another is found nearby at VI.18.8.
118
Hoffmann (183) reads injunc. párā han for Pp. párā ahan. Given the
preponderance of injunctives in these vss. and esp. han at the end of 5c, this seems
likely. (See also sácāhan in the next vs. and 6d.)</p>
<h3 id="vi264">VI.26.4</h3>
<p>As in 3c, Hoffmann (184) reads sácā han in c rather than Pp. sácā ahan,
which seems perfectly plausible. As for the unequivocal imperfect ā́vaḥ in b, he
suggests that this may not have been the original form, citing the almost identical
I.33.14b prā́vo yúdhyantaṃ vṛṣabháṃ dáśadyum. If the original reading was *prā́vaḥ,
it could contain the injunctive: prá avaḥ. However, it is unclear to me how the
corruption would have arisen, particularly because in the next vs. (5) the d pāda
begins prā́vaḥ. Moreover the pāda preceding I.33.14b begins with ā́vaḥ, a clear
imperfect matching the one here. Hoffmann’s other observation &ndash; that this pres. stem
has no clear injunctive forms (and only one possible one, ávaḥ in I.121.12, which
more likely belongs to the s-stem noun; see comm. ad loc.) &ndash; seems more apposite.
For whatever reason the injunctive to this stem was avoided &ndash; or, perhaps better
phrased, ā́va- was treated as the injunctive stem.
I do not entirely understand what sácā is doing here; it seems to add little and
have no obvious syntactic connection to the rest. As discussed ad IV.31.5, sácā with
loc. is regularly a pleonastic marker of the loc. abs., but there is no loc. here. Gr cites
our passage here as an ex. of sácā after a dat. meaning “zu seinen Gunsten,” but I
don’t understand how this meaning would have developed from ‘together with’. The
same sequence (sácā han) is found two vss. later (6d) in the same general context:
Indra’s smiting of an enemy on behalf of a mortal friend, and I.63.3 tváṃ śúṣṇam …
kútsāya dyumáte sácā han shows the same configuration. In all three passages I tr. it
‘in partnership’ as an adverbial. Perhaps sácā signals an esp. close relationship
between Indra and his mortal beneficiary. The voc. epithet of Indra in 7c, hapax
sadhavīra ‘you who have our heroes as companions’ in my tr., might support this
view, and see also 8ab. I am not entirely persuaded by my own interpr., however.
On tūtos, tūtot as belonging to a redup. aor., not the perfect (contra Wh Rts,
Macd. VGS), see detailed disc. by Kü (220–21); Hoffmann also identifies it as an aor.
(183); Gr already took it as a caus. aor., and see also Schaeffer (Intens. 129–30).</p>

Pāda b contains one of the few exx. of the “-si imperative” that betrays its
non-imperatival source, since dárṣi occurs in a subord. cl., from which imperatives
are barred. Here it shows its original subjunctive value in a purpose cl. (so also
Hoffmann, 183).
Initial áva in c breaks the long pattern of 2nd sg. pronouns beginning the
hemistich (vss. 2–5a, resumed vss. 6, 7c, with such forms also beginning even pādas
2d, 4d, 7b). Perhaps it is meant to resonate with 4b #ā́vo, 5d #prā́vo.</p>

<p>As I have discussed elsewhere (Sacrificed Wife, 176–84), śraddhā́- in Vedic
is not simply an abstract ‘trust, faith’, but refers specifically to trust in the efficacy of
ritual and hospitality, and indeed to the concrete manifestations of this trust through
119
ritual gift-giving. The plural śraddhā́bhiḥ here, paired with sómaiḥ, seems to refer to
the offerings themselves.

an instr. of accompaniment, esp. given the larger context of the hymn, in which Indra
works for and in conjunction with mortals (see esp. disc. ad vs. 4 with regard to sácā).
The hapax cmpd sadhavīra applied to Indra seems to reflect this situation, though
exactly what the word means is unclear (Gr ‘mit den Männern seiend’, Ge
‘Heldengenosse’), and its lack of accent makes it difficult to determine even what
type of cmpd it is. (AiG has no disc. of it.) I take it as an underlying bahuvrīhi
‘having heroes together (with oneself)’ vel sim., expressing the mutual relationship
between our men and Indra.
Ge takes the instr. phrase trivárūthena náhuṣā as referring to Indra: “da du ein
dreifacher Nahus bist.” He bases this interpr. on X.49.8 ahám … náhuṣo náhuṣṭaraḥ
“I [=Indra] am a greater Nahus than Nahus.” But this passage is in an ātmastuti, a
genre in which Indra claims to be the best example of everything, and the
construction with comparative in fact precludes an identification of Indra with
Nahus: he is asserting that he has more of what makes Nahus Nahus than Nahus
himself does. It is an expression like “more Catholic than the Pope.” (As for X.99.7,
which Ge also cites, I have now changed my interpr. from the publ. tr. and will
register the change in the comm. in due course.) I consider Nahus here another
recipient of the praise being doled out, though I do have to admit that the shadowy
Nahus otherwise does not figure in the VIth Maṇḍala.
I would also take issue with Ge’s bleaching of trivárūtha- from
‘having/providing threefold defense’ to simply ‘threefold’. This cmpd. otherwise has
its full lexical value, mostly modifying śárman- ‘shelter’, and the simplex várūtha-
‘defense’ is robustly attested, so the 2nd cmpd member had not become opaque.</p>
<h3 id="vi268">VI.26.8</h3>
<p>This final wish to become Indra’s dearest companions neatly sums up the
dominant theme of the hymn, esp. the last vss.</p>
<h2 id="vi27-indra">VI.27 Indra</h2>
<p>VI.27.1–2: These two vss. form a tight pair, whose responsions are detailed below.</p>
<h3 id="vi271">VI.27.1</h3>
<p>This vs. is structured by the extreme repetition of kím, found 5 times in
interlocking sets. In the 1st hemistich 3 occur in the phrase kím (u) asya LOC. The 1st 2
are initial in the 1st pāda and immediately after the caesura, while the third one, rather
than opening the 2nd pāda, gives the impression of syncopation by being placed after
pāda-initial índraḥ. The third pāda has the sequence in scrambled order: … LOC kím
120
(té) asya, with the tonic prn. té incongruously inserted. The last kím u, in pāda d,
lacks both asya and the LOC, but clearly is conjoined with kím in pāda c with the rest
of the phrase construction truncated.
There are many possible ways to interpr. this construction. The first question
is whether kím is a question particle or a neut. interrogative prn. (see, e.g., Etter,
Fragesätze, 75, 124–25), or indeed if some of the occurrences are one, some the
other. I am firmly of the opinion that, simply on rhetorical grounds, the number of
repetitions favors a referential prn. for all, rather than a particle. Moreover, vs. 2
offers a concrete answer to the question “what?” — namely sát ‘being, what exists’
— in the same number and in the same positions as kím in vs. 1. The responsion
could hardly be more complete. Another question is whether pāda a should be read
independently, as containing two parallel nominal clauses, with the hemistich-final
verb only having domain over pāda b, or whether the verb should be read with the
whole hemistich. Because of the parallelism of the kím (u) asya phrases I opt for the
latter solution, as does Ge.
Another curiosity is the fact that asya is unaccented in all its occurrences.
Unaccented forms of this pronoun should be anaphoric, with a referent preceding in
the discourse, but of course in the 1st vs. of the hymn there is no preceding discourse.
However, the first two locatives, in pāda a, establish without doubt the identity of the
referent &ndash; soma: “in the exhilaration (máde) of it” and “in the drinking (pītaú) of it”
could refer to nothing else in the universe of RVic discourse. See the numerous
examples of máde sómasya (generally in that order) in Lub, beginning with I.46.12;
the loc. of pītí- is almost confined to our passage, but the dat. phrase sómasya pītáye
is almost inescapable (see again Lub). The 2nd set of locatives, sakhyé ‘in the
fellowship’ and niṣádi ‘in the installation’ are less clearly typed for soma &ndash; and in
fact the latter might sidetrack us to Agni and his ritual installation &ndash; but by that time
the soma context has been unequivocally established. The unusual application of ní
√sad to soma simply shows the frequent secondary fusion of the two principal ritual
divinities/substances.
The first hemistich is otherwise unproblematic, but the second one raises
some further questions. The first word, ráṇā, is taken by the Pp as nom. pl. ráṇāḥ in
pausa, an interpr. followed by the standard treatments. By this interpr. these “joys”
are the subj. of vividre in the main cl. Both act. and mid. forms of this pf. are
normally transitive, and so the question should be “what did the previous joys find,
what the new ones?” See Ge’s “Oder was seine guten Launen bei der (Opfer)sitzung
sind, was haben die … erreicht?” But this does not make a lot of sense to me: in what
way are “joy” agents here? Old seems to get out of this semantic problem by taking
the verb as a sort of pass./intrans. with gen. asya as the experiencer (presumably
referring to Indra) and kím as a predicate nominative: “oder die Freuden, die bei
(seinem, des Soma) Sichniederlassen &hellip;, als was sind diese ihm eignen … erfahren?”
But besides forcing an unnatural sense on the verb, it assumes a different referent for
asya in c from the referents of the 3 occurrences in ab (as does Ge’s). My own
interpr. is based on a different analysis of ráṇā — as the instr. sg. of the root noun
rán-, attested as dat. sg. ráṇe, loc. sg. rán, and indeed (pace Gr) as this same instr. sg.
121
in IX.7.7 (see Old ZDMG 63 [1909]: 289 = KlSch 305). (Note that with the elim. of
the supposed nom. pl. in our passage, the stem ráṇa- is entirely singular, save for a
single late loc. pl. ráṇeṣu [X.120.5], quite possibly confected to produce a Triṣṭubh
cadence from sg. ráṇe.)
With ráṇā otherwise interpr., the subj. of vividre is open. I supply “priests”
(or a similar group of mortal devotees of Indra); cf. nū́tanāsaḥ in similar usage in
nearby VI.21.5 and the similarly contrastive expression pū́rvebhir ṛ́ṣibhiḥ …
nū́tanair utá in I.1.2. One problem remains, however. By my interpr. asya in c has
the same referent as the other 3 exx. in ab, and like them it is construed with a loc.,
here niṣádi: the insistent repetitive pattern of the vs. imposes this reading. But asya is
stationed in the main clause, as marked by the immediately preceding té, correlative
with yé in the nominal relative cl. (cf. the whole pāda ráṇā vā yé niṣádi kíṃ té asya),
though it should precede kíṃ té. (Ge’s rendering cited above also has this problem,
though he construes asya with ráṇā(ḥ), not niṣádi.) I can only explain this by
assuming that acdg. to the pattern established in ab, kím (x) asya LOC, kím here has
carried the pronoun asya along with it into the main cl., even though the constituency
is in all cases asya LOC.

reference to the change from augmented to injunctive verbs.</p>
<h3 id="vi275">VI.27.5</h3>
<p>Abhyāvartin Cāyamāna is the subj. of the dānastuti in vs. 8.
As in VI.20.10, this vs. contains a 3rd sg. root aor. dart with retained (or
restored) final cluster -rt, even though such retentions are supposedly only licit if the
-t belongs to the root. I argued ad VI.20.10 that the sandhi situation there favored the
retention of the cluster (before following dh- [&lt; *h-]). I suggest that our form here
has been adopted from that passage, since verse-final position would not favor the
retention. Another passage containing dart that seems dependent on VI.20.10 is
I.174.2b, identical to VI.20.10c, though in I.174.2 dart must be a 2nd sg., and so is
doubly illicit.</p>

<p>On the warriors’ slang in this vs. and the curiously literal attempts at
interpreting pā́trā bhindānā́ḥ, see publ. intro. and Old ad loc., Ge n. 6d. For śárave
páyamānāḥ see disc. ad X.27.6.</p>
<h3 id="vi277">VI.27.7</h3>
<p>The purport of this vs. and the referent of yásya in pāda are disputed. As Ge
points out (n. 7), Sāy. thinks ab refers to Indra and his two fallow bays, while Ge
thinks yásya refers to Śṛñjaya found in c and marks the beginning of the dānastuti. I
agree with Sāy. that Indra is the referent of yásya, but not that the two cows are
really his two horses. As noted in the publ. intro., I instead assume gā́vau refers to
the two rivers found in vss. 5 (Hariyūpīyā) and 6 (Yavyāvatī). A strikingly similar
expression refers unequivocally to two rivers in the famous hymn III.33 (Viśvāmitra
and the Rivers): III.33.1 gā́veva śubhré mātárā rihāṇé “licking each other like two
mother cows (their calves)” (cf. also III.33.3). The only problem is that though, in
122
this gender-variable stem, du. gā́vau can be either masc. or fem. (for the latter, see
gā́vā in III.33.1 just cited), one of the du. adjectives in our passage, aruṣā́, should be
masc., since the fem. of this stem is áruṣī, which in fact appears with pl. gó- in
I.92.1-2: gā́vó ’ruṣīḥ, áruṣīr gā́ḥ. I can only assume that since the rest of this dual NP
(gā́vau … sūyavasyū́… rérihāṇā) could be either masc. or fem., aruṣā́was just
slotted in, esp. because it looks like a possible fem. du. Alternatively, MLW suggests
that aruṣā́could in fact be feminine and an archaism, since the devī́- inflection of
thematic color adjectives is an innovation.
The verb antár … cárataḥ is somewhat difficult to interpr. This lexeme
generally refers to a journey between two locations &ndash; often of Agni’s journey as
messenger between heaven and earth. Here no locations are specified, and, assuming
the correctness of my identification of the dual subject as the rivers of vss. 5–6 (not a
certain assumption), it is two rivers that must be performing the action. Perhaps the
verb is reciprocal, expressing action between the two subjects: “(the two rivers) go
back and forth one to the other,” but this would leave yásya without an obvious role
in the clause. Instead I take yásya as the beneficiary of the action (that is, as if an
honorary dative) and assume the rivers are acting as go-between for Indra, either
between his forces and the enemy’s or between the two divisions of the Vṛcīvant
forces referred to in 5d. The genitive is assuming some of the functions of the dative
already in the RV, and of course in later Sanskrit datival genitives are extremely
common &ndash; probably indirectly reflecting the loss of the dative in MIA.
VI.28 Cows and Indra</p>
<h3 id="vi281">VI.28.1</h3>
<p>In pāda a ‘house’ is supplied as obj. of bhadrám akran on the basis of 6c
bhadráṃ gṛháṃ kṛṇutha. Ge simply “haben Glück gebracht,” Whitney (AV IV.21.1)
“have done what is excellent,” and this is certainly possible.</p>
<h3 id="vi282">VI.28.2</h3>
<p>What precise kind of land ábhinne khilyé refers to is unclear; see disc. by
Old and Ge n. 2d. The general opinion is that ábhinne (‘uncut, unsplit’) describes
land that hasn’t been broken into parcels, but I wonder if it instead means
‘unploughed’ &ndash; that is, unsplit by a plough.</p>
<h3 id="vi283">VI.28.3</h3>
<p>I do not understand what nuance the vṛddhi of ā́mitrá- adds to amítra-. Both
seem simply to mean ‘enemy, foe’. MLW suggests that it might be a collective, a
possible function for a vṛddhi deriv.
Ge takes vyáthiḥ as a “falsch Weg” upon which the enemy will lead the cows,
requiring him to supply a complex verb phrase to √dhṛṣ, “wagen … den falschen
Weg (zu führen)” (see also his n. 3b for an even more complex alternative). But
vyáthis- ‘wavering or meandering course’ fits the normal aimless wandering of cows
in pasture, and surely we wish to prevent cattle rustlers (or the like) from taking
advantage of the cows’ wandering. Cf. Whitney, AV IV.21.3 “shall dare attack their
track (?)”; Klein (DGRV I.219) “a hostile one shall not venture upon their way.” For
123
the wandering habits of cows, see 4cd urugāyám … ví caranti “They wander far
across wide-ranging (space).”
Given the acc., it seems best, with Ge et al., to take devā́n only with yájate,
not, as in the publ. tr., also with dádāti. I therefore would emend the tr. to “With
those (cows) that he sacrifices to the gods and (that) he gives …” The expression is
compressed: the instr. yā́bhiḥ should of course only be construed with yájate, and we
should have an acc. *yā́ḥ as obj. of dádāti. As a parallel to devā́n, Ge supplies a
datival “(den Sänger)” with dádāti (sim. Klein loc. cit.), but I see no reason to limit
the recipient in this way. Cf. the open-ended 2b úpéd dadāti, which specifies neither
gift nor recipient. The unstinting giver is rewarded.</p>
<h3 id="vi284">VI.28.4</h3>
<p>On reṇú-kakāṭa- see EWA s.v. kakā́ṭikā-, kṛ́kāṭa-. Some part of the back of
the head/neck is meant. What exact threat the dusty-necked steed poses to the cows
isn’t exactly clear. Sāy. explains árvā as yuddhārtham āgato ‘śvaḥ. I would limit the
“intent to fight” more narrowly to a cattle raid, but there is no further evidence to
bring to bear. See immed. below.
saṃskṛtatrám is also somewhat problematic. It is generally referred to the root
√kṛt ‘cut’ (see AiG II.2.170 and, most recently, EWA p. 316 s.v. KART1
), but this
affiliation is disputed by Whitney (Roots, p. 23) and, most vigorously, by Old, who
assigns it to √kṛ for both formal and semantic reasons. The standard rendering is
‘Schlachtbank’ (slaughter or, Whitney [AV, despite Rts], slaughterhouse). Against
this interpr., Old makes the reasonable point that in this pre-ahiṃsā era there’s no
reason why a cow-owner wouldn’t have his cows slaughtered when he wanted to.
But Old’s own solution is excessively convoluted and requires that the final -trabelong to √trā ‘protect’, which seems dubious. (On gotrá- and other possible forms
of the thematized root noun -trā́- in compounds, see Scarlatta [194–95].) To meet
Old’s objections, we can interpr. the clause in the context of the preceding clause and
of the whole vs. The 2nd half of the vs. expresses a wish for the safety of cows that
roam widely, presumably not always under the control and in the sight of a herdsman.
The first hemistich mentions several misadventures that could befall these roving
cattle. Pāda a refers, if I’m right, to a cattle raid conducted by horsemen &ndash; what in
the Old West (or at least the Old West of the imagination) would be called rustlers. It
may be that the “dusty neck” of the horse in question indirectly indicates that the
horse is not a well-cared-for beast of the Ārya elite, or else that the raid requires hard
riding in rough country. The second pāda may indicate that the cattle rustled were
taken for meat or, under a different scenario, that the cows wandered into territory
controled by tribals, non-Ārya, or even non-elite Ārya (all without access to horses)
who would ambush, kill, and eat them. Both pādas would imply that the cattle are far
from the safety of their home and enclosure.
My “place for dressing” reflects the possibility (see above) that saṃskṛtabelongs to √kṛ not √kṛt, and is a euphemistic expression for slaughter. However, if it
does belong to √kṛt “… for slaughter” would be just fine.
The word order in pāda b is somewhat aberrant. The fem. pl. subj. tā́(ḥ)
occurs right after the verb, followed by the preverb abhí, which ends the pāda: x x x
124
x x, úpa yanti tā́abhí. We would ordinarily expect the pronoun tā́(ḥ) to occur early in
the clause (cf. pāda a #ná tā́(ḥ) [=3a]) and the preverb to precede the rest of the
verbal complex. The word order disturbance may have been caused by the need to fit
the bulky 4-syllable sáṃskṛtatram into the pāda, since it won’t fit the Jagatī cadence.</p>
<h3 id="vi285">VI.28.5</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. follows the usual configuration of equational nominal
sentences, with the subject in 2nd position, the predicate nominal 1st
. This interpr. is
supported by the fact that the verb achān is singular, agreeing with bhágaḥ and
índraḥ, not with pl. gā́vaḥ ‘cows’. However, the standard tr. (Ge, Wh) follow the
opposite order, e.g., Ge “Diese Kühe sind mir wie Bhaga …” In which case, we
would have to assume that achān simply agrees with the nearer referent, even though
it is the predicate.
In c the phrase sá janāsa índraḥ must be a deliberate echo of the famous
refrain of II.12. It also demonstrates the standard Vedic prose syntactic rule that in an
expression of the type “what is X, that is Y,” the demonstrative in the 2nd cl. will
agree with Y, not X, in number and gender, even though its real referent is X, or in
this case cows. For further disc. see Brereton’s “Tat tvam asi in Context.”</p>
<h3 id="vi286">VI.28.6</h3>
<p>This vs., like 5c, has an echo from the 2nd Maṇḍala: the final pāda bṛhád vo
váya ucyate sabhā́su “Your vigor is declared loftily in the assemblies” strikingly
resembles the Gṛtsamāda Triṣṭubh refrain br̥hád vadema vidáthe suvī́rāḥ “May we
speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes.” Both begin with
adverbial bṛhát and contain a verb of speaking &ndash; a passive in our case &ndash; and a loc. of
the place where the speech is spoken: vidáthe ‘at the ceremony of distribution’,
sabhā́su ‘in assemblies’, with sabhā́- probably inhabiting a lower register, as might
be appropriate for cows.
Kulikov (-ya-pres., 214) denies a passive value for ucyate here and tr. “Your
energy sounds loudly in the assemblies” for reasons that don’t seem sufficient to me.</p>

<h3 id="vi288">VI.28.8</h3>
<p>The usual tr. of this vs. tend towards the euphemistic &ndash; e.g., Ge “Dieses
Befrüchtungsmittel soll … sich fruchtbar zeigen”; Kulikov (-ya-pres., 153 with nn.
373, 374) “Let this increase increase in these cows.” But √pṛc means ‘fill, engorge,
mingle’, and with úpa, the preverb of intimacy, it takes on a distinctly sexual sense. I
take it as ‘inseminate’ in this passage, especially because of the bull’s semen in c.
See disc. also ad I.40.9. Moreover, the -ana-suffix on upapárcana- is one that
ordinarily signals a transitive sense and often has a close connection to a transitive -
áya-formation (though not in this case). Unlike the standard tr. I take pāda a as a
nominal sentence and pṛcyatām in b as an impersonal. In my interpr. upapárcana- is
the ‘inseminator’ &ndash; either the bull or the bull’s penis or semen, whose match is found
in the hyper-virile Indra in d. My interpr. requires that that the two locc. in the 2nd
125
hemistich (rétasi, vīryè) have a different usage and appear in different clauses from
góṣu in b.</p>
<h2 id="vi29-indra">VI.29 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="vi291">VI.29.1</h3>
<p>Three of the four pādas begin with a form of máh-, incl. the curious acc. sg.
masc. mahā́m in d.
sepuḥ is the only perfect form attested to the root √sap in all of Sanskrit. Ge tr.
it with present value (“Den Indra ehren die Herren”) without comment, and the publ.
tr. follows suit. Kü (547) argues strenuously &ndash; and plausibly &ndash; against this interpr.
on historical grounds and takes it as “kontinuativ”: “Indra haben (seit jeher) die
Männer … geehrt (and ehren ihn jetzt noch).” This interpr. might fit well with the
curious double participle in pāda b: yántaḥ … cakānā́ḥ. Although both Ge (“voll
Verlangen nach der Gunst des Grossen kommen”) and Kü (“indem die [au ihm]
gehen, um die Gunst des Grossen [zu erlangen], begierig”) take the two participles as
independent and with their full lexical value, Ge suggests (n. 1b) that they could form
a periphrastic construction, which is in fact reflected in the publ. tr.’s “as they go on
finding pleasure in the great one,” with yánt- supplying a continuative sense. The
participial periphrasis might be an attempt to signal the continuative value of the
perfect in pāda a, which that form cannot do on its own. The nearest thing to such a
continuative in English would be “The men have (always) kept honoring Indra …” or
(less clumsily) just “have (always) honored,” and I would now substitute one of these
tr.
Ge construes sumatáye with cakānā́ḥ (see tr. cited above), but forms of the
root √kā/kan regularly take the acc. or loc., never the dative. Note that Kü supplies a
verb to govern sumatáye and takes cakānā́ḥ absolutely. I suggest rather that sumatáye
is parallel to sakhyā́ya in pāda a. Since √kā/kan can also occasionally take the gen.
(cf. VII.27.1 śávasaś cakānáḥ “taking pleasure in your strength”), I take maháḥ with
cakānā́ḥ, though a tr. like Kü’s would also be possible: “for the sake of the
partnership and benevolence of the great one, taking pleasure/desiring (it/him).”
I do not understand why ásti is found in pāda c, since there is no need for an
overt copula, and it is difficult to interpret the verb as an existential. It is true,
however, that overt copulas are more common in subordinate than in main clauses.
Or perhaps ásti is part of the effort to express present continuative.</p>
<h3 id="vi293">VI.29.3</h3>
<p>As in I.37.14 (see comm. ad loc.), dúvaḥ here must be a nom. pl., not the
usual sg. neut., nor the acc. pl. identified by Gr. On the somewhat aberrant syntax of
this construction, see disc. by Kü (386–87). The juxtaposition of du. pā́dā and
dúva(ḥ) suggests that the latter is also meant to evoke du
vé, the neut. du. ‘two’ with
‘feet’.
Ge couches b in the 3rd ps. (see tr. cited below), but since this nominal clause
is positioned between two clauses with undoubted 2nd ps. ref. to Indra (pāda a: te, d
babhūtha) and itself contains no overt indications of 3rd ps., there is no reason to
switch person and then switch back.
126
The instr. śávasā was omitted in the publ. tr. Although Ge tr. it with
dákṣiṇāvān (“ist durch seine Macht ein Lohnausteiler”), the close association
between dhṛṣṇú- and śávas- elsewhere in the RV (e.g., I.54.2, 56.4, I.167.9, IV.16.7,
VI.66.6; cf. I.54.2 (etc.) dhṛṣṇúnā śávasā) suggests a tr. “As the mace-bearer, bold
with (your) vast power &hellip;” As was just noted, in the publ. tr. śávasā was omitted
entirely; the just suggested tr. should be substituted.
Note that pāda b is a lexically variant version of 1c, which contains
vájrahastaḥ for our vajrī́and dātā́for our dákṣiṇāvān).</p>
<h3 id="vi294">VI.29.4</h3>
<p>Whatever the etymological facts &ndash; the root affiliation of the pf. mimikṣ-
(etc.) is disputed (see, e.g., Kü 385–89, who assigns it to √myakṣ, and EWA s.v.
MEKṢ, esp. 374) &ndash; the two forms of mimikṣúḥ in this passage (vss. 2, 3) are
synchronically associated with miśla-/miśrá- here. As noted in the publ. intro., the
three vss. form an omphalos with the theme of attachment, and the superlative
ā́miślatama- ‘most firmly attached / entwined / intermixed’ in pāda a provides the
climax &ndash; at least in my view. Not all interpr. see the contextual continuity and
therefore do not tr. accordingly. E.g., Ge renders ā́miślatama- as ‘der anziehendste’
(the most attractive), which captures neither its use in this context nor its probable
connection with *meiḱ ‘mix’ (EWA s.v. miśrá-)(though the base verb ‘anziehen’ has
a physical dimension closer to the sense I see). I am happy to say that Old’s interpr.
is very close to mine, including supplying Indra with the adj.: “Der gepresste Soma
soll der am besten (dem Indra) anhaftende [clinging] sein.”
The referent of the loc. yásmin in b is unclear. The structure of the half-vs.
suggests sá of a, namely soma, and this seems to be the standard interpr.: cf. Ge’s
“Der gepresste Soma ist der anziehendste, zu dem Kochspeise gekocht wird …”; also
Kulikov (p. 403, p.c. from W. Knobl) “That Soma is pressed as most easily mixing,
with which [, when being pressed,] cooked food is being cooked.” I don’t understand
either of these tr., esp. the latter, and they do not make ritual sense: food is not
cooked in/for/with soma (though grains can be mixed in it). Since, in my interpr.,
Indra is another, if unexpressed, participant in pāda a, I take yásmin as referring to
him. This identification is supported in the larger context by yásmin in 2a, the
beginning of the omphalos, where it refers to Indra’s hand (yásmin háste “in which
hand”), or as Ge suggests there (n. 2a), “yásmin ist Attraktion für yásya” (referring to
Indra directly). These two occurrences of yásmin (2a, 4b) would frame the omphalos
ring-compositionally. The suggested reference to Indra gets further support from
passages like IV.24.7 yá índrāya sunávat sómam adyá, pácāt paktī́r utá bhrjj̥ ā́ti
dhānā́ḥ “Whoever will press soma for Indra today, will cook the cooked foods, and
will roast the grains …”
The two pres. participles in cd, stuvántaḥ … śáṃsantaḥ, must be predicated,
substituting for a main verb.</p>
<h3 id="vi295">VI.29.5</h3>
<p>Kü (221) suggests that the pf. part. tū́tujāna- may already be a lexicalized
adj. meaning ‘sich bemühend, eilend, eifrig’ and tr. its occurrence in our passage
quasi-adverbially, “mit Eifer,” an interpr. fld by Lowe (Participles, 216). But it
127
seems to me to have its full lexical value, deriving from √tuj ‘thrust’, in this context,
where the preceding pāda describes Indra forcing apart (bābadhe) the two worldhalves and the following pāda compares him to a herdsman driving together
(samī́jamānaḥ) his herds &ndash; both actions requiring some amount of thrusting. In its
other occurrences this part. either clearly or arguably has lexical value; cf. e.g.
I.61.12 … prá bharā tū́tujānaḥ … vájram … “bear down the mace, thrusting …” In
general, I see no reason to rob forms of lexical value unless they regularly appear in
contexts in which such value would be semantically inappropriate. That a participle
does not appear with a full panoply of complements does not mean that it has been
sematically bleached beyond recognition &ndash; a view that is at odds with, e.g., Lowe’s
approach to the issue.
Ge sharply denies (n. 5d) that ī́ja- can belong to √aj ‘drive’, but he was of
course writing before the full flowering of laryngeal theory. For the derivation see
EWA s.v. AJ, p. 51.
I tr. hemistich-final ūtī́with pāda c, but the fact that that pāda has an exact
repetition in VI.37.5d throws that interpr. into doubt. Nonetheless, I still think ūtī́is
to be construed with the preceding pāda, skipping over the simile that begins pāda d.
It should really be Indra’s help that is in question, not that of the herdsman, an interpr.
reinforced by the initial sequence in the 2nd pāda of the next vs., 6b ūtī́ánūtī, also
referring to Indra.</p>

<p>The double evā́(a, c) strongly marks this as an extra-hymnic summary vs.</p>
<h2 id="vi30-indra">VI.30 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="vi301">VI.30.1</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the first pāda is an oblique ref. to the soma
sacrifice that strengthens Indra for the Vṛtra-smashing; cf. III.40.7 pītvī́sómasya
vāvṛdhe also with Indra as subj.</p>
<h3 id="vi302">VI.30.2</h3>
<p>The use of bhūt with the āmreḍita divé-dive seems to reinforce the regularly
recurring individual nature of the event: it is not that the sun is always lovely, but
that it becomes visible anew, every day. This is more or less Hoffmann’s view &ndash; he
cites and tr. the pāda 4x (pp. 135, 140, 267, 274) &ndash; though he slightly changes his
terms of analysis from citation to citation (e.g., 135 expressing the truth of natural
laws; 140 iterative).
It is striking that both c and d end with 3rd sg. root aor. injunctives, bhūt and
dhāt respectively. It is all the more striking because they don’t seem to have parallel
functions. As just noted, bhūt expresses a recurrent, hence not time-limited event, but
dhāt seems to express a particular (cosmogonic) action in the past. Hoffmann
characterizes this as “resultative Konstatierung” (214) and tr. (216) “Der Machtvolle
(Indra) hat weithin die Wohnsitze verteilt.” By not considering the two adjacent
pādas together, Hoffmann avoids confronting this functional discrepancy; I have no
explanation of it, though see comm. on the next vs.
128</p>
<h3 id="vi303">VI.30.3</h3>
<p>The relationship between natural activity in the present and the deeds Indra
performed in the past to set that activity in motion is made clear in the 1st hemistich.
The rivers continue to do the work (pāda a) &ndash; presumably flowing through their
assigned channels &ndash; that Indra started them on by digging those channels in the
mythic past (pāda b). The temporal immediacy of the rivers’ work is emphasized by
the opening phrase in pāda a adyā́cin nū́cid “even today, even now” with doubled
emphasizing cid, while pāda b portrays Indra’s original action with the augmented
impf. áradaḥ. This offers us a clue as to how to interpret 2cd, with its functional and
temporal discrepancy. As is well known and often expressed, Indra put the sun in
heaven in the first place; cf., e.g., I.52.8 ádhārayo divy ā́sū́ryaṃ dṛśé “You fixed the
sun fast in heaven to be seen.” Since the audience would be well aware of this, they
could connect the continued re-appearance of the sun every day in pāda c (divé-dive
somewhat matching 3a adyā́cin nū́cid functionally) with Indra’s original deed,
referred to in general terms in the preceding pāda (2b) yā́ni dādhā́ra. Indra’s creation
of the sun is also referred to in the final pāda of this hymn, 5d … sū́ryaṃ janáyan.
In pāda a we can possibly see a secondary pun in ápaḥ ‘work’ &ndash; namely apáḥ
‘waters’ (see 4c, 5a), despite the accent difference.</p>
<h3 id="vi305">VI.30.5</h3>
<p>Pāda a contains two fem. pl. nouns (one clearly, one likely accusative), apáḥ
‘waters’ and dúraḥ ‘doors’, and a fem. pl. adj. víṣūcīḥ ‘wide, wide asunder, in
all/opposite directions’ that could modify either or both. It also contains the preverb
ví, stationed between the two nouns and with a metrical rest right before it that draws
attention to this position. It does not, however, contain a verb. There are three
syntactic possibilities (at least as I see it): 1) we should supply two different verbs,
each forming a possible lexeme with ví and each governing one of the two nouns; we
should supply a single verb, 2) which takes a double acc. or 3) which governs both
nouns in parallel. (Old and Ge n. 5a lay out slightly different possiblities.) Ge opts
for the second: “Du (liessest) die Gewässer durch die Tore nach allen Seiten (laufen),”
supplying asṛjaḥ from 4d. It is not clear what the doors through which the waters
surge would be. I think it is rather the first. With Ge I would supply asṛjaḥ, but with
only apáḥ as obj. Although √sṛj is relatively rare with ví, ‘waters’ is of course
regularly the object of other forms of this root, particularly áva as in the immediately
preceding pāda. Moreover ví √sṛj is used of the release of liquid in VII.103.7 (“frog”
hymn), where heated milk-drinks “attain their own release” (aśnuvate visargám). As
for the 2nd object, ví √vṛ ‘unclose, open’ is standard with ‘doors’, and I supply a form
of √vṛ here. The point of this hemistich is that Indra opens up and disperses
everything closed and enclosed. What the “doors” are in this scenario is still
somewhat unclear: it could be, as in Dawn hymns, the doors of darkness and refer to
Indra’s flooding the world with light (note the sun and dawn in the last pāda of the
vs.), or it could simply refer to Indra’s general opening up of spaces, esp. the Vala
cave.
In b the ppl. dṛḷhá is reprised from 3d, but with a nice twist. In vs. 3 Indra
makes the spaces firmly fixed, but here he breaks open what had been firmly fixed.

<h2 id="vi31-indra">VI.31 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="vi311">VI.31.1</h3>
<p>On the semantic connection between the first and second hemistichs, see
publ. intro. Particularly note the simple etymological figure in cd #ví … #ávocanta
… vívācaḥ# in the half-vs. concerning the disunity of the various peoples; here the
etymological sense of carṣaṇí- as ‘bordered, separate (people)’ also gets fully used.
In contrast to the ví-s of cd, we might have expected the presence of sám in ab to
express the unity found there, since this is the standard contrastive pairing. But the
theme of unity is expressed in ab by ékaḥ and hástayoḥ: Indra alone takes them all
into his two hands.
The phrase rayipate rayīṇā́m is clearly of the familiar “X-lord of X-es” type,
though it has some twists. On the one hand, though rayipate is a voc. and lacks
accent, rayī́ṇā́m has its usual accent even though oblique case forms in voc. phrases
regularly lose their accents. On the other, the nom. ékaḥ should be construed with the
voc. rayipate, not independently (that is, the pāda doesn’t mean “You have become
the one, o wealth-lord of wealth”). Ge takes the phrase as a predicative voc. The publ.
tr. represents the construction as a haplology, because the predicative voc. is next to
impossible to render into English &ndash; or German: Hoffmann’s (Injunk. 218) “du
(Indra) bist es allein geworden, o Reichtumsherr der Reichtümer” is cautionary in
that regard. Ge’s cited parallel IV.17.6cd satā́bhavo vásupatir vásūnām, dátre víśvā
adhithā indra krṣṭ̥ ī́ḥ, which closely resembles the hemistich here, reinforces the
constituency of our rayipate rayīṇā́m.
In c the standard formula toká- tánaya- ‘progeny (and) posterity’ is
interspersed with other locatives of the stakes, in the sequence toké apsú tánaye ca
sūré; I take the ca here as connecting the formulaic pair and have tr. them together,
with the others postponed. Cf. VI.25.4, 66.8.</p>
<h3 id="vi312">VI.31.2</h3>
<p>cyāvayante is the only med. form to this stem, against 16 act. transitive ones.
Although in my 1983 monograph (p. 126 n. 43) I identify it as intransitive, I now
think it is a passive to the transitive act.: “are bought to shaking, caused to shake”
rather than a simple intr. semantically identical to cyávate (i.e., just ‘shake’). Fear of
Indra is the cause and Indra the unexpressed agent.</p>
<h3 id="vi313">VI.31.3</h3>
<p>The content of this vs. is somewhat illuminated by the similar account of the
Śuṣṇa battle and the theft of the sun’s wheel in IV.16.9–14, esp. vs. 12, as Old and
Ge point out.
The tenses and moods of this vs. are ill-assorted; for various views, see Old,
Hoffmann (Injunk. 190–91), Klein DGRV II.101–2. The first issue is the impv.
yudhya ordering Indra to fight a mythological enemy long since defeated. Old reports
with apparent, though not full-voiced, approval, Gr’s (Üb) suggestion to read injunc.
yudhyaḥ, but later points out that the gods are often urged to do a deed that actually
happened in the past &ndash; hence the transmitted impv. yudhya would be perfectly fine.
(And Gr Wö lists the form thus.)
130
At the beginning of c, dáśa is taken by Ge (fld. by Klein; see also Gr Wö) as
an impv. to √daṃś ‘bite’ (in the sense ‘stachle’ [spur on, goad]), with ‘horses’
supplied as obj. Given the discrepancy between the root meaning and the sense
suggested here, as well as the absence of an expressed object, it seems best to follow
Old (who cites Gr’s Üb. [though curiously Gr in the Wö interprets it as Ge does])
and Hoffmann and take dáśa as the numeral, referring to the companions of Śuṣṇa
(like the thousands [sahásrā] mentioned in IV.16.12 containing śúṣṇam aśúṣam …
kúyavam as here).
A new clause begins in the middle of pāda c, introduced by ádha and
containing the injunc. muṣāyaḥ, which is hard to harmonize with the impv. (yudhya)
that precedes it. Ge (fld. by Klein) interpr. the injunc. as a functional impv.,
coordinated with the impv. he sees in dáśa; cf. Klein “Goad (thy horses) … and steal
the wheel of the sun.” Whereas Hoffmann takes the injunc. as “generell”: “Da
stiehlst du die Scheibe der Sonne,” further specified in his discussion with “da …
stiehlst du (immer wieder), hast du die Fähigkeit (Eigenschaft) zu stehlen.” Neither
the impv. nor the general reading seems satisfactory: although some injunctives
function as imperatives, that usage is limited to a few stems, generally the root
aorists dāḥ, dhāḥ, and bhūḥ. As for the “general” interpr., although it might make
sense to say of someone (even Indra) “you have the capability/propensity to steal,” it
is stretching what “general” means to apply it to a single and quite specific event:
“you have the capability/propensity to steal the sun’s wheel.” The publ. tr. follows
the presential rendering of Hoffman: “you steal” (though without the “general”
nuance). I now think this is incorrect and that the injunctive simply expresses the past
here. The first part of the vs. vividly evokes the attack on Śuṣṇa by imagining it
before our eyes, with the speaker urging Indra to enter the fight. But the narrative
then reverts to a recital of the mythical past. I would therefore alter the tr. to “So then
you stole the wheel of the sun.”
The last VP in the vs. brings up a different issue. The transmitted Saṃh. text
is áviverápāṃsi, analyzed by the Pp. as áviveḥ rápāṃsi, from an assumed underlying
*áviver rápāṃsi with simplification of the double r across word boundary by the
well-known sandhi rule. This interpr. is followed by Ge and Klein; cf. Klein “Thou
has set aright the damages.” But as in I.69.8 (q.v.) I follow Old (accepted also by
Hoffmann) in reading áviver ápāṃsi, with ápas- ‘labor’. This does not require
alteration of the Saṃh. text.</p>
<h3 id="vi314">VI.31.4</h3>
<p>The preverb áva is positioned somewhat oddly for a preverb in tmesis,
though it does follows the caesura and is thus adjacent to a metrical boundary. We
might have expected it to migrate to the pāda-initial position. Its displacement may
be to allow the pattern of verse-initial forms of the 2nd sg. pronoun to continue: 2a
t
u
vád, 3a t
u
vám, 4a t
u
vám.
My all-purpose tr. of the (more or less lexicalized) desid. to √śak ‘be able’,
namely ‘do one’s best’, loses the etymological connection here with śácyā śacīvaḥ “o
able one, with your ability” &ndash; but something like ‘strive to be able’ implies the
possibility of Indra’s failure, which does not fit his divine profile.
131
The voc. sutakre is a hapax, analyzed by Gr as belonging to a su-takri ‘very
fast’, but by the Pp (fld. by the standard modern interp.) as suta-kre. As Old points
out sunvaté suta- would be the same type of etym. figure as śácyā śacīvaḥ. Sāy.
glosses abhiṣutena somena krīta, and this in fact remains the standard interpr. For
disc. of both sense and morphology (transfer of the root noun to long-vowel √krī to a
short i-final) see esp. Old and Scar (87–88). Both cite as support for the purchase of
Indra the very interesting passage IV.24.10 (q.v).
This is the only 5-pāda vs. (Śakvarī) in the whole run of Indra Triṣṭubh hymns
(VI.17–41) and seems designed to insert the poet of this maṇḍala into the hymn and
associate him with his sometime formulaic partner Divodāsa. See esp. VI.16.5bc
dívodāsāya sunvaté / bharádvājāya dāśúṣe also in this maṇḍala. Those two Gāyatrī
pādas are almost identical to ours, except for one ritual participle, gṛṇaté, substituting
for another, dāśúṣe, in the Bharadvāja pāda &ndash; and for the three additional syllables in
each pāda (d sutakre, 3 vásūni) to fill out the Triṣṭubh. The addition of this
extraneous material to adapt the shorter line to a different metrical form may account
for the fact that vásūni seems to have no syntactic or semantic connection to the rest
of the vs. Although Ge construes it with áśikṣaḥ (“wobei du … DAT … die Schätze zu
verschaffen suchtest”), śíkṣa- does not elsewhere take an acc. (the few su he&rsquo;s doing
something beneath his dignity or even shameful pposed passages in Gr are to be
interpr. differently) but generally only a dative. The publ. tr. takes vásūni as a loosely
attached acc. goal of Indra’s helpful actions: “for goods” or, to make the purpose
somewhat clearer, “for (them to obtain) goods.” The poet would have been better off
just throwing in another voc., as he did at the end of d. The addition of vásūni here
may have been facilitated by the appearance of … gṛṇaté vásūni# twice elsewhere
(IV.24.1, IX.69.10), in both of which vásūni is the object of a verb earlier in the pāda.</p>
<h3 id="vi315">VI.31.5</h3>
<p>Another tricky etymological figure is found in the hapax cmpd satya-satvan,
both members of which have developed their own lexical senses but both derived
from √as ‘be’.
For prapathin see comm. ad I.166.9.
The stem carṣaní- returns as the last word of the hymn, echoing 1d, for which
see publ. intro. The ring composition is rather perfunctory.</p>
<h2 id="vi32-indra">VI.32 Indra</h2>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the first vs. is a meta-verse in which the poet
refers to his own just-composed praise; the remaining vss. constitute that praise, and
all begin with the prn. sá, a stylistic repetition that unifies and defines the praisehymn proper. It is noteworthy that, although the vocabulary and rhetoric leave no
doubt of the identity of the recipient of the praise, the name “Indra” is not mentioned
until the last vs. (5b) and the word “god” not at all. In this connection note the
unaccented dat. asmai ‘for him’ in the first pāda of the hymn. Such unaccented
oblique pronominal forms assume a referent already in the discourse, so Indra is
present from the beginning despite not being named or even referred to at this point
132
in the hymn, and the dative descriptors that follow in this vs., particularly vajríṇe
‘possessing the mace’ in c, simply reinforce the audience’s recognition.</p>
<h3 id="vi322">VI.32.2</h3>
<p>The identity of the “two mothers/parents of the poets” (mātárā … kavīnā́m)
has been much discussed; see esp. Old, as well as Ge (n. 2ab) and Schmidt (B+I 151).
The two leading candidate pairs are Heaven + Earth (/the two World Halves) and
Heaven + Dawn, but only the former seems at all likely to me. Dawn and Heaven are
not a stable pairing and therefore would be unlikely to be referred to by the pregnant
dual mātárā, whereas this dual is regularly used of Heaven and Earth. Cf. esp.
IX.75.4 prarocáyan ródasī mātárā śúciḥ [/ IX.85.12 prā́rūrucad …], where ródasī
‘the two World Halves’ is explicitly present and where the verb is a lexical variant of
our ávāsayat ‘caused to shine’.
Why they are considered “the parents of poets” is not clear. If it isn’t simply
that Heaven and Earth provide everyone the conditions for existence and therefore
count as universal parents (which seems rather lame), perhaps they become parents
of poets when Indra makes them shine with the sun, calling forth the poetic effusions
at the dawn sacrifice. The tenuousness of the parental connection has led to
suggestions for other ways to construe kavīnā́m. Ge suggests that the clause is a
blend of two senses: Heaven and Earth are the referents of the dual, and they are
simply named as parents without indication of their offspring, but the poet also
wanted to refer to Dawn as the (single) mother of the Aṅgirases, and so the gen. pl.
kavīnā́m belongs only to this putative expression (mātáram kavīnā́m). This seems
overly complex, and in addition I know of no evidence that Uṣas was the mother of
the Aṅgirases. Old suggests that kavīnā́m could be construed as genitval agent with
gṛṇānáḥ, but since that participle is in a different clause, that solution is out. Perhaps
the best, if we don’t want to construe it with mātárā, is Sāy.’s, to take kavīnā́m as the
equivalent of a dative of benefit (aṅgirasām arthāya).
The part. vāvaśānáḥ in c has generally been ascribed to √vaś ‘want, be eager
(for)’: so Gr and Lub, as well as the tr. ‘begierig’ of Ge and Schmidt. However, Kü
has argued (478–80) that all forms of the perfect stem vāvaś- actually belong to √vāś
‘bellow’, not √vaś &ndash; though he sneaks some of the semantics of the latter into his
glosses ‘brüllen sehnsüchtig’ (etc.). Although I do not want to eliminate the pf. to
√vaś in so absolute a way as Kü, in this passage at least I think the participle
embodies a pun and, moreover, the primary sense is ‘bellowing’, not ‘being eager’.
The central narrative of the Vala myth has Indra vocalizing in concert with the
Aṅgirases (“the very attentive versifiers”) in order to break open the cave and release
the cows. No doubt he was “eager” to accomplish this, but it is the noise-making that
is the focus of the myth. In this vs. we get a double view of Indra: he is both hymned
(gṛṇānáḥ b) presumably by the Aṅgirases and also sings (/bellows) along with them,
with two complementary participles, both modifying Indra and stationed at the end of
adjacent pādas. The cooperation of Indra and the Aṅgirases is emphasized in the next
vs.
133</p>
<h3 id="vi323">VI.32.3</h3>
<p>On mitájñu- see Scar 344; it is used here in a context very similar to abhijñú
in III.39.5, which also concerns Indra and the Aṅgirases at the winning of cattle and
contains parallel phraseology: sákhā ha yátra sákhibhiḥ … abhijñú … gā́anugmán
“When the comrade with his comrades the Navagvas, the warriors, from their crouch
followed after the cows.” The ‘knee’ cmpds presumably describe the stance of the
warrior-poets in this conflict, at least in these two passages. However, in VII.95.4, a
hymn to Sarasvatī, it describes the position of “reverential ones” (namasyà-)
imploring the goddess in prayer, and though there is a martial portion of VII.82.4,
where another example of the stem occurs, the form in question is found in the part
of the vs. that describes invocations made in peace time. The final instance of the
word, in III.59.3, is too generic to pin down. Thus, it seems that a posture with “fixed
knees” may be adopted in various circumstances, including that of prayer.
The second hemistich contains a series of balanced etymological figures:
púraḥ purohā́sákhibhiḥ sakhīyán, … kavíbhiḥ kavíḥ sán. I am somewhat puzzled by
the nom. sg. pres. part. sán, which is usually concessive, but which should not have
that function here. The use of sán is esp. surprising because it breaks the parallelism
of the two rhyming post-caesura phrases in cd: … sákhibhiḥ sakhīyán, … kavíbhiḥ
kavíḥ sán. We should expect rather *kavīyán, matching sakhīyán, and in fact the stem
kavīyánt- does exist (IX.94.1 kavīyán, also in pāda-final position). Perhaps an exact
match would have been considered too sing-songy, and the near-match
phonologically of -íḥ sán with -īyán suggested the figure without insisting on it. Or
else the poet wanted to emphasize that Indra is indeed a poet, in addition to his usual
roles as victorious warrior and first comrade among comrades. In the latter case, the
phrase might be tr. “being himself a poet along with poets.”</p>
<h3 id="vi324">VI.32.4</h3>
<p>Pāda b is also found at IV.22.3b, where it is a part of an independent
nominal clause. However, here it fits well within the larger clause structure, whose
main verb is prá yāhi at the end of the vs. Cf., e.g., VIII.2.19 ó ṣú prá yāhi vā́jebhiḥ,
with the vā́jebhiḥ of our b. The fact that this pāda is a self-contained repetition aids in
the interpr. of the surrounding pādas a and c, both of which contain fem. instr. pls.,
nīvyā̀bhiḥ and puruvī́rābhiḥ respectively. Although two masc. instr. pls. intervene,
vā́jebhiḥ and śúṣmaiḥ, they can be sequestered in the ready-made pāda b, and the two
feminines of a, c can be construed together.
Although Gr interpr. the hapax nīvyā̀bhiḥ as belonging to a fem. noun nīvyā̀-,
most subsequent interpr. take it as an adj. If both nīvyā̀bhiḥ and puruvī́rābhiḥ are
adjectives, we need to determine the underlying referent that they modify. As just
noted, the first of these instr. is a hapax, but puruvī́ra- occurs 9x in the RV; in 6 of
these occurrences it modifies rayí- ‘wealth’ (IV.44.6, VI.6.7, 22.3, 49.15, VIII.71.6,
X.167.1), including 3x in VI. Given the marked predominance of this collocation, the
most likely referent for puruvī́ra- in our passage is also rayí-. Now rayí- is ordinarily
masc., but there are occasional fem. usages, and although I have tried to whittle down
their number (see comm. ad VI.8.5), it cannot be reduced to zero. One occurrence of
puruvī́ra- is a clear fem. modifying rayí-: X.167.1 rayím puruvī́rām. I therefore
supply a form of ‘wealth, riches’ here, with fem. gender, as referent for both fem.
134
adjectives. It may be that the feminine was chosen here to signal that these instr. pls.
do not modify the masc. instr. pl.s in b.
This now brings us to the meaning and affiliation of the hapax nīvyà-. This is
generally and fairly plausibly connected with nīví- ‘loincloth’ or undergarment of
some sort, first attested in the AV and found also in the VS and early Vedic prose.
The developed meaning of our adj. is supposed to be ‘(something) to be wrapped and
carried in a nīví-’. Cf. Ge’s “mit in den Schurz gebundenen (Geschenken?)”; Old
more expansively suggests that Indra could knot into his loin cloth a host of strong
sons. He compares nīvibhāryà- ‘to be carried/worn in the nīví- in AV(Ś) VIII.6.20
(=AVP XVI.81.1), which is certainly suggestive. However, this interpr. encounters a
practical difficulty: just how much can be carried in a loincloth? Even Indra, whose
garments are presumably more capacious than ours, would probably not be able to fit
into his underwear the extravagant amount of gifts we generally ask him for. The
images that come to mind — at least to my mind — are of a hobo’s bundle at the end
of his stick and of a stork delivering a baby in a cloth sling (presumably a diaper?)
hanging from its beak, both of which have limited carrying space. The AV passage
containing nīvibhāryà- simply confirms this. Found in a hymn “To guard a pregnant
woman from demons” (in Whitney’s title), the verse in question concerns possible
miscarriage (áva √pad lit. ‘fall down’, but a standard idiom for miscarriage) and
recommends that the pregnant woman carry/wear two remedies in her nīví-:
VIII.6.20bcd yád dhitáṃ mā́va pādi tát / gárbhaṃ ta ugraú rakṣatāṃ bheṣajaú
nīvibhāryā̀“What has been deposited [=embryo], let that not ‘fall down’; let the two
powerful remedies to be worn/carried in your nīvi protect your embryo.” This
obviously involves inserting into the garment some sort of prophylactic of modest
enough size that it could be reasonably worn on an everyday basis &ndash; not taking off
the garment and stuffing it full of goodies.
The publ. tr. maintains the connection with nīví-, or rather with √vyā
‘envelop’, which at least some take as the root at issue (see Gr, also [critical] disc. in
KEWA s.v. nīvíḥ; the morphology is admitted difficult, and EWA casually suggests a
connection to ní √yu ‘join’ [perhaps anticipated by Ge’s invocation, n. 4a, of niyút-],
which does not seem a better alternative, as it would require an unprecedented
alternate syllabification of the zero-grade of √yu to *iv). The publ. tr. ‘to clothe (him)’
rests on the metaphor of clothing as wealth. Cf. nearby VI.35.1 kadā́stómaṃ vāsayo
‘sya rāyā́“When will you clothe his praise-song with wealth?” However, I now see
that I brushed aside problems of both form and function: the root √vyā does not
distract its initial cluster, but both meter and accent require a reading nivíyā-; if the
form is meant to be a gerundive, it should be passive in function, a usage not
reflected in the translation; vowel-final preverbs do not lengthen before √vyā; ní is
not found with √vyā in the RV. I now suggest that the form belongs to a different
root entirely: √vī ‘pursue’. This root is found with ní in the RV, though only in the
intensive (see Schaeffer, 190–91), in a usage I tr. ‘bear down on’, though here it
could mean something more like ‘track down’ or simply ‘pursue’. Among the many
objects that forms of √vī take, riches and the like are found (e.g., in this maṇḍala</p>
<h3 id="vi126-1">VI.12.6</h3>
<p>véṣi rāyáḥ). Moreover, in root-noun cmpds with this root, vowel-final
135
preverbs are lengthened: pratī-vī́- (3x), prā-vī́- (1x), and cf. devā-vī́- (12x) beside
deva-vī́- (1x, though cf. common devá-vīti-). (On these lengthenings see Scar 499,
500, 501.) The derivation is not without problems. If the form is a gerundive (as I’d
like), the root accent is fine, but we would expect guṇa or vṛddhi, not zero-grade.
Despite this formal problem, I think this root affiliation and formal interpr. solve
many of the problems that other interpr. face, and so I would emend the tr. to “…
with (riches) to be tracked down/pursued …” in place of “… to clothe (him).”</p>

<p>sárgeṇa … taktáḥ is a decomposed variant of sárga-takta- (III.33.4, 11)(or,
vice versa, the cmpd is compounded from this phrase).
Ge terms this a “dunkler Sagenzug,” but I’m not sure why it can’t just be a
snippet of the Vṛtra myth, after the serpent has been killed and Indra has released the
pent-up waters, as I say in the publ. intro. Although vss. 2–3 concern the Vala myth,
Vala and Vṛtra themes often appear in the same hymns. Ge also considers it difficult
to supply the missing verb in b, but given sárgeṇa in a and the passively used aor.
part. sṛjānā́ḥ in c, implicitly modifying the waters, the missing verb is most likely a
transitive form of √sṛj, with acc. apáḥ as obj., rather than Ge’s “hat … (geleitet).”
Among the many such passages, see very nearby VI.30.4 ávāsṛjo apó áchā
samudrám, also with Indra as subj. Sim. Sāy.’s visṛjati.
The root-noun cmpd. turā-ṣā́ṭ picks up turā́ya in 1b in a nod towards ring
composition. I tr. ‘overcoming the precipitous’ rather than my ‘overcoming the
powerful’ in the other three passages (III.48.4, V.40.4, X.55.8) in order to capture
this echo.</p>

<p>The pāda-final dā́svān, to be read with distraction as dáasvān, presumably
reflecting a laryngeal hiatus, resonates with sauvaśv(i)yam and s(u)vaśvo in b, despite
the different sibilants. The stem dā́svant- (8x) must always be read distracted and
presumably reflects, as already indicated by Gr, an underlying s-stem built to √dā,
hence in IIr. terms *dáh-as-.</p>
<h3 id="vi332">VI.33.2</h3>
<p>In c I tr. ví paṇī́m̐r aśāyaḥ as “you dispersed the niggards.” I now think this
probably is wrong, in that I cannot find a semantic pathway there from ví √(n)aś
‘reach through’, etc. The closest passage to ours that contains this multivalent lexeme
is X.29.8 vy ā̀naḷ índraḥ pṛ̥́tanāḥ svójāḥ “The very powerful Indra has penetrated the
battling hosts.,” and I would alter the publ. tr. to “you penetrated through the
niggards …” The only thing that gives me pause is the very similar passage adduced
by Ge, VII.19.9 … ví paṇī́ṃr ádāsan#, which I tr. “They … have distanced the
niggards through ritual service” (for which see comm. ad loc.).
As the above disc. suggests, I take aśāya- as belonging to the root √(n)aś, but
the morphology is not straightforward. With Whitney’s tentative suggestion (Skt. Gr.
§1066b), I assume it belongs with the class of -āyá-presents to zero-grade roots that
are generally related to 9th class presents (e.g., gṛbhṇā́ti, gṛbhāyá-) and ultimately
reflect (in my opinion, flg. Saussure) -yá-deverbatives built to the weak stem of the
9th class pres. (-nH-yá-). Unfortunately, of course, √(n)aś had no final laryngeal and
no 9th class pres., though it does have a well-attested 5th class aśnóti. I must assume
secondary spread of the -āyá-suffix to this root (see also naśāya- X.40.6, also
apparently to √naś), perhaps facilitated by the nasal-suffixed present. MLW suggests
here a clever alternative, that aśāyaḥ actually represents a haplologized form of the
causative of √śi ‘lie’, śāyáyati, and with ví means ‘you caused the niggards to lie in
pieces / scattered about’. Although Wh (Rts) lists this causative as beginning only in
the sūtras, it may well appear once in the AV (Ś IV.18.4); see my -áya-formations,
pp. 134–35. Although MLW’s suggestion is appealing on its own &ndash; and the
haplology would not be problematic (see the -yaya- haplology posited above in
VI.12.4) &ndash; the other forms of the stem aśāya- (I.34.7, X.43.6, 92.1) are not easily
amenable to a ‘lie’ interpr. but fit ‘reach’ quite well; aśāyata in VIII.73.9, usually
grouped with these forms, I take to √śā ‘hone, sharpen’ (see comm. ad loc.).</p>

<p>The Ārya obstacles are presumably peoples akin to us, but fighting against
us.
As noted in the publ. intro., Indra’s apparent weapons of “well-placed cloaks”
(súdhitebhir átkaiḥ) are puzzling. I think this is a reference to Indra’s shape-shifting
ability, to wear “different hats” in different situations &ndash; and Ge’s parallels in n. 3c
suggest that he is of the same opinion. Old discusses at length and
uncharacteristically endorses the suggested emendation of Ludwig/Bergaigne of
átkaiḥ to arkaíḥ, though he does admit it&rsquo;s hard to explain how the corruption would
have arisen. I think this is a fairly insuperable problem, esp. since súdhita- is not a
2
particularly likely descriptor of ‘chants’, and is in fact not found with words of that
sort.
As also noted in the publ. intro., I suspect that súdhita- is a buried play on
words. It is stationed between váneva “like the woods, trees” and átkaiḥ. In
conjunction with the former, it evokes svádhiti- ‘hatchet, axe’; cf., for similar
context, X.89.7 jaghā́na vrtrá ̥ ṃ svádhitir váneva “He smote Vr̥tra, like an axe the
trees.” For another pun involving svádhiti-, see V.32.10 where the “Heavenly
Hatchet” (devī́svádhitiḥ) probably plays on svadhā́- ‘independent power’. See
comm. ad loc.
As already pointed out ad VI.4.7, nṛtama is not suitable for the cadence of any
Vedic meter, and save for this passage and VI.4.7 it avoids this position. It is found
several times with nṛṇā́m in the cadence but in the reverse order: IV.25.4 nṛ́tamāya
nṛṇā́m, V.30.12, X.29.2 nṛ́tamasya nṛṇā́m, where the oblique forms of nṛ́tamasupport a good Triṣṭubh cadence. The order may have been flipped here, but why?</p>

<p>The injunc. bhūḥ here has imperatival force, a function of the injunctive
generally limited to the root aorists dāḥ, dhāḥ, and bhūḥ.</p>
<h3 id="vi335">VI.33.5</h3>
<p>I do not see any difference in sense between the imperatival injunc. bhūḥ of
4b and the pres. impv. bhávā in 5b.
With Old, who argues this at length, I take the Saṃhitā mṛḷīká as loc. mṛḷīké,
rather than Pp. mṛḷīkáḥ. See also Klein, DGRV I.314. The conjunction utá, which
connects it with clear loc. abhíṣṭau, strongly supports this interpr. (Ge’s interpr. is
not clear.)
The opening of the 2nd hemistich, itthā́PARTICIPLE, matches that of the
opening of the last hemistich in the preceding hymn (VI.32.5), and the diví opening
pāda d resembles divé-dive in the same position in VI.32.5.
The final pāda has a bad cadence: goṣátamaḥ. As MLW points out, this form
should really be *goṣātamaḥ (splv. to goṣā́-). Such a reading doesn’t improve the
expected Triṣṭubh cadence, but it would provide a proper Jagatī cadence (and
metrical variety at the end of a hymn is not unexpected). The pāda can be read with
12 syllables without difficulty: diví ṣ
i
yāma pārye *goṣātamaḥ. As for the transmitted
short vowel form, it might have been changed to match nṛtama in 3d, although, as
noted there, the light initial syllable of that form is itself. metrically problematic.</p>

<p>The first hemistich of this vs. (and thus of the hymn) contains a compact
summary of Rigvedic poetic economy, with the god Indra both the focus of the poets’
praise songs and the source of inspiration for them. This is expressed in two
antithetical pādas, conjoined by double ca, with the oppositional preverbs sám and ví
opening the pādas and two 3rd pl. verbs of motion providing the verbal expression:
jagmúḥ and yanti. The first of these is accented, the 2nd not, even though the two
pādas are coordinate, as the double ca-s show. The accent of jagmúḥ can be
3
accounted for by the principle that accents the first of two explicitly contrastive verb
forms, though usually such verbs are adjacent or nearly adjacent. Klein’s (DGRV
I.167) of contrastive double ca constructions has several such passages, with the 1st
verb accented; e.g., I.123.12 párā ca yánti púnar ā́ca yanti. Our passage is unusual
only in having more matter between the verbs. Note how very parallel the pādas are:
PREV ca 2ND-SG-PRN VERB, with the pre-verbal loc. tvé and abl. tvát carrying their
own contrastive weight.
Another ex. of phrasal echoes among the Indra hymns in this cycle: purā́
nūnáṃ ca “previously and now” plays off against nūnám … aparā́ya ca “now and for
the future” in the immediately preceding hymn (VI.33.5). See also possibly VI.35.5.
The Saṃhitā prevocalic form stutáya is universally read/interpr. as underlying
nom. pl. -aḥ, beginning with the Pp. (also Gr, Ge, Lub, Kü 584), but HvN
unaccountably restore -e, which must simply be a lapse.
The dvandva ukthārkā́(to be distracted to uktha-arkā́) is most likely a neut.
pl., serving as another subject of the verb paspṛdhre, not a dual masc., which is
harder to fit into the syntax of the clause &ndash; though plural dvandvas are far rarer than
dual dvandvas in early Vedic. This is one of the earliest exx. See Whitney Gr.
§1255e; Macd VG §265; VGS p. 269; AiG II.1.38, 156. The 2nd member arká- is
itself masc. when independent. The cmpd. deviates from dvandva orthodoxy in other
ways: it has only one accent, and at least in this metrical context the first member
ends in short -a and is probably in stem form (or else show shortening in hiatus).</p>
<h3 id="vi342">VI.34.2</h3>
<p>The heavy presence of puru-PAST PART. cmpds in the first hemistich
(puruhūtáḥ … purugūrtáḥ … purupraśastáḥ) was prepared for by the fem. pl. pūrvī́ḥ
in 1a and the (unrelated) purā́in 1c.
It is difficult to render the gerundive + injunctive phrase anumā́dyo bhūt; “has
become one to be cheered on” is excessively fussy.
The instr. asmā́bhiḥ was unaccountably omitted in the publ. tr.: I correct to
“… to be cheered on by us.”</p>
<h3 id="vi343">VI.34.3</h3>
<p>To say that praises don’t harm Indra seems a little odd: who would think
that they would?
nákṣanti is one of the few examples where íd by itself seems to induce accent
on the verb; most of the putative examples (see Gr s.v. íd, §5, p. 206) involve pādainitial verbs that could owe their accent to their position. I am not entirely certain,
however, that this passage exemplifies this property of íd, since initial índram in b
could be enjambed over the pāda break, and nákṣanti start a new clause. V.32.5
presents an undoubted ex. of íd inducing verb accent.
I interpr. yádi in c as *yad ī, i.e., an example of the enclitic acc. ī univerbated
with a preceding yád (see my 2002 “RVic sīm and īm,” Fs. Cardona). This is a
particularly clear ex., because of the parallel yád later in the pāda (*yád ī stotā́ra
śatáṃ yát sahásram “when a hundred praisers, when a thousand”), where an
imbalance of subordinators (“if a hundred praisers, when a thousand …”) would not
4
make sense. Moreover the form is followed by a cons. cluster (yádi stotā́raḥ), so that
the meter would be unaffected by *ī shortened to -i.
VI.34.4–5: The identical openings of these two vss., ásmā etád, pick up the last
clause of vs. 3, śáṃ tád asmai, and invite the two phrases to be interpr. as separate
clauses, with śám to be supplied from 3d, as both Old and Ge point out.
My interpr. of the rest of ab is generally inspired by Ge.
The form mimikṣá is interpr. by the Pp. as mimikṣáḥ, though mimikṣé is also
possible and is a strong alternative. In the former case, it would be an adj. built to the
verbal stem mimikṣ-, parallel to adj. mimikṣú-; in the latter a 3rd sg. mid. pf. The pf.
interpr. is followed by Gr and Kü (386), though Kü (n. 690) does allow the
possibility of the thematic adj. as an alternative. AiG (II.2.86) and Lub take it as an
adj., and Old and Ge consider both possibilities, but favor the Pp. reading. I too take
it as an adj., in part on grounds of syntactic parallelism: 4ab and 5ab are quite
parallel. They both begin with the ásmā etád clause discussed above; then a ritual
feature (soma sómaḥ / praise hymn stotrám ) is announced as in/for Indra (índre /
índrāya), with the verbal notion connecting the offering and the god expressed by an
augmented passive aor. (ny àyāmi / avāci) in the latter part of b. If we have a finite
verb mimikṣé in the early part of b, it chops the pāda into two clauses and destroys
the parallel structure (a point made somewhat differently by Old). Moreover, the
simile in 4a divy àrcéva māsā́(with diví parallel to índre; see also Old) works better
if construed with ny àyāmi than with mimikṣé, but given the word order it would have
to belong to the mimikṣé clause if mimikṣá stands for that verb.
As for the just-mentioned simile, I am entirely persuaded by the gist of Ge’s
suggestion (n. 4ab) that māsā́should signal an elliptical dual sū́ryā-mā́sā ‘sun and
moon’, the two heavenly bodies set in heaven, as soma is set in Indra. However, he
deals rather wispily with the stumbling block to this interpr., namely the accentuation
of māsā́, proper to the instr. sg., instead of the expected dual mā́sā. Judging from his
lapidary treatment, he would by preference read (that is, emend to) du. *mā́sā
directly, with arcā́also du. Hence his tr. “wie (Sonne und) Mond, die beiden
Strahlenden.” But if māsā́must be maintained, he would interpr. (see n. 4ab) arcéva
as containing *arcáḥ, the nom. sg. to an otherwise unattested them. stem arcá- and
exhibiting irregular sandhi, and māsā́as an instr. of accompaniment, rather like the
expression in X.138.4 māséva sū́ryaḥ, in which māséva presumably conceals the
instr. māsā́construed with nom. sg. sū́ryaḥ: “like the sun with the moon,” that is, “the
sun and the moon.” I would very much like to rescue Ge’s interpr. based on an
elliptical dual, an interpr. reflected in the publ tr., because I think it has to be
fundamentally correct in context. But it is going to be challenging. I would prefer not
to emend māsā́, and I also do not think that excavating arcáḥ irregularly from arcéva
is the way to go. My flimsy alternative proposal (though followed by Old; see below)
is that arcéva contains the nom. sg. of a fem. -ā́stem arcā́- (found in the Br., in a
different sense) ‘shining/beaming one’ à ‘sun’. Old, flg. Ludwig, in fact also opts
for a nom. arcā́‘der Glanz’, though he connects this Glanz with the moon: “wie zum
Himmel der Glanz vom Monde (gelenkt wird).” For the connection of the sun with
5
forms belonging to √arc, see V.79.9, VIII.7.36 sū́ro arcíṣā, and of course it is
regularly said that the sun is set/placed diví ‘in heaven’ (e.g., XV.85.2 diví sū́ryam
adadhāt “when he placed the sun in heaven”; see disc. in my 2010 Fs. Melchert
article on the “Placer of the Sun”). I suggest that this stem arcā́- is found only here
because it was mobilized to contrast with -arkā́‘hymns’ at the end of 1d. I would
now alter the tr. to “the soma has been set firmly in Indra, like the shining one [=the
sun] along with the moon in heaven.” Note that an instr. of accompaniment is used
with a nom. in lieu of a coordinate expression in the 2nd hemistich: hávanāni yajñaíḥ
“our invocations along with our sacrifices” = “our invocations and sacrifices.”
Note that under this interpr., the supposed root noun árc- would no longer
exist, since this stem rests only on this form in all of Skt., supposedly the instr. arc-ā́.
In fact, the existence of this root noun was already denied by Schindler in his 1972
diss. (s.v.), because of its full grade, and he rehearses the various alternative
proposals, including Hoffmann’s (oral) suggestion that arcā́is the loc. to arcí-, a
stem that has the merit of existing, though it is hard to fit it semantically into this
passage. The actual root noun to √arc/ṛc ‘shine/sing’ is of course ṛ́c- ‘verse’, which
gives our text its name.
In c the phrase (abhí) sáṃ yád ā́paḥ “when the waters con(verge) (on him)”
reminds us of the opening of the hymn, where songs converge on Indra. I do not
pretend to understand the construction of cd. Indra is obviously the unexpressed
object of vāvṛdhuḥ (cf. 3b índram … vardháyantīḥ) and the comparandum for the
simile that opens the hemistich, jánaṃ ná dhánvan “like a man in the desert,” but the
verbless yád clause seems rather casually embedded and with the yád unusually
positioned after two preverbs (unless abhí should be taken only with somewhat
distant preceding jánam).</p>
<h3 id="vi345">VI.34.5</h3>
<p>The balance and reciprocity between god and worshipers evident earlier in
the hymn also characterizes its ending. The last thing said about Indra is that he is
our ‘strengthener’ (vṛdháḥ 5d), just as our offerings, both material and verbal, have
strengthened him (vardháyantīḥ 3b, vāvṛdhuḥ 4d).</p>

<p>Ge takes bráhma as an abstract “Hohepriesterschaften,” standing for the
personal pl. brahmā́ṇaḥ (n. 1a). I see no reason to take bráhma in any sense other
than its usual ‘sacred formulation(s)’ (pl. in this instance)(nor does Schmidt, who tr.
“Wann werden die Gedichte ihren Sitz auf dem Wagen haben?” [152]). The vs.
concerns the exchange of priestly praise for material goods bestowed by the god: the
clothing of our praise with Indra’s wealth (c) and the bejeweling of our insights with
his prizes (d) are vivid metaphors. The first pāda contains a likewise striking image:
the chariots in which our formulations take up their position are presumably the
chariot(s) Indra gives us, which will also be heaped with goods. It is our production
6
of the formulations that brings the chariots. The intent of this image is made clearer
by vs. 3b viśvápsu bráhma kṛṇávaḥ.
Both bhuvan and dāḥ are subjunctives, or at least have subjunctive function.
Contra Hoffmann (246), I am inclined to take dāḥ as a real subjunctive (&lt;*dā-a-s),
though without metrical distraction, not an injunctive, while both of us take bhuvan
as subj. here.</p>
<h3 id="vi352">VI.35.2</h3>
<p>Both Ge and Schmidt take the first hemistich as depicting a hostile
encounter between two sets of men and heroes expressed by the verb nīḷáyāse (Ge:
“… dass du Herren mit Herren, Mannen mit Mannen in Kampf verwickeln wirst?”;
HPS [153] “… dass du … handgemein (?) werden lässt?”); Old is less certain but
suggests that “kämpfen machen, überwinden” is expected. But the basis of this hapax
demon. nīḷáyāse, namely nīḷá- ‘nest’, invites an interpr. depicting a more intimate
and amicable relationship (like the adj. sánīḷa- ‘of the same nest’, referring to
brothers and comrades), and the middle voice reinforces that sense. In my 1983
monograph on -áya-formations, I follow an interpr. suggested by Insler, that the verb
means ‘accept as equals’ (pp. 84–85). Although I think that may be an implication, I
now think it can be taken more literally: ‘put in your own nest’. Indra is bringing our
fighting men into intimate contact with his own (the Maruts and/or Aṅgirases [the
latter being mentioned in vs. 5]) under his auspices; with these now conjoined forces
he can win the contests and the cattle at stake.
The accent of the denom. nīḷáyāse (expect *nīḷayā́se) has been retracted
because the form is transitive (acc. nṛ́̄n … vīrā́n) and has been attracted into the -áyatransitive / causative class (see my 1983 monograph).</p>
<h3 id="vi353">VI.35.3</h3>
<p>This vs. is a reprise of and variation on vs. 1. Like vs. 1, it treats the rewards
that accrue to verbal praise, and in fact repeats two of the three types of verbal
products found in vs. 1 (bráhma 1a/3b, dhíyaḥ 1d/3c), with stómam (1c) and
hávanāni (3d) being the novel terms. bráhma and hávanāni are modified by
bahuvrīhis that express the material reward they will obtain (‘all goods’ [viśvápsu]
and ‘cattle as bounty’ [gómaghā] respectively). In the c pāda the chariot motif of 1a
returns in slightly different form: we “team up” our insights, as Indra does his teams
(niyútaḥ) &ndash; the teams that, pulling his chariot (cf., e.g., I.135.4 rátho niyútvān), will
bring Indra and his bounty to the sacrifice, where the “teams” of insights will be
exchanged for the goods he brings.
On viśvápsu- see comm. ad I.148.1.</p>
<h3 id="vi354">VI.35.4</h3>
<p>Both jaritré and gómaghā are repeated from the previous vs. (where they
were not in the same clause), though the latter has changed gender: in 3c it is neut.
pl., while in 4a the same sandhi form is fem. pl. and represents underlying
gómaghā(ḥ). This bahuvrīhi has spawned two parallel descriptors: áśva-ścandrā(ḥ)
and vā́ja-śravasaḥ, all three modifying fem. pl. pṛ́kṣaḥ.
The tr. ‘lay on’ (that is, provide, often lavishly, often of meals or feasts) is an
English idiom that precisely calques ádhi dhehi.
7
I take íṣah … dhenúm as a double acc. with √pī ‘swell’ &ndash; lit., ‘swell the cow
the refreshments’, that is, ‘swell the cow with refreshments’. Ge hesitates (n. 4c), but
in the tr. opts for two acc. in parallel (‘swell the refreshments, (swell) the cow’), as
does Schmidt (p. 153).
The root-noun cmpd surúc- (9x) is generally a bahuvrīhi meaning ‘having
good light, very bright’, as in II.2.4 tám … candrám iva surúcam “him [=Agni] very
bright like gold.” For just this passage Gr posits a substantivization: f. ‘heller Glanz’.
This is unnecessary, as surúcaḥ here can be a fem. pl. acc. picking up and modifying
f. pl. íṣah in c (and indeed the glittering pṛ́kṣaḥ in b). It obviously forms an
etymological figure with the opt. rurucyāḥ.
As for this verb, it should have transitive/causative value (‘make shine /
illuminate’), and it therefore functionally overlaps with the redupl. aor. árūruca-.
This overlap is complicated by the fact that several apparent pf. forms rurucuḥ also
have this value, in some of which lengthening the redupl. to *rūrucuḥ would provide
a better cadence, though in our passage such a lengthening would produce a worse
cadence. For disc. of these ambiguous forms see comm. ad IV.7.1, 16.4. As I say
there, because the 3rd sg. pf. ruroca and the pf. part. are intransitive, I am inclined to
think that the transitive 3rd pl. forms originated in the redupl. aor. but were absorbed
by the pf., with shortening of the redupl. vowel.</p>
<h3 id="vi355">VI.35.5</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the first hemistich of this vs. is quite unclear; I
am not at all certain my interpr. is correct, but I don’t think it’s appreciably worse
than any others, which I will not treat at length. One observation about it, which
doesn’t really aid in its interpr., is that it seems to play off the Agastya Triṣṭubh
refrain (I.165.15d, etc.) vidyā́meṣáṃ vṛjánaṃ jīrádānum “May we find refreshment
and a community having lively waters.” A large proportion of the occurrences of
vṛjánam are found in that refrain. The jinva at the end of our vs. picks up the jīrá- of
the refrain, and its íṣam is matched by our íṣaḥ in 4c.
I’d also point out that the antithetical temporal expressions we noted in the
two previous hymns, nūnám … aparā́ya ca “now and for the future” (VI.33.5) and
purā́nūnáṃ ca “previously and now” (VI.34.1), may be echoed by nūnám …
anyáthā cid “now and also otherwise.”
But let us now turn to the serious problems of the vs.: 1) there is apparently
no verb (or anything else) to govern tám … vṛjánam; 2) there is no verb to govern
the presumed acc. dúraḥ ‘doors’ in the rel. clause; 3) esp. if gṛṇīṣé is taken to be the
verb of the rel. cl. and a 2nd sg. passive ‘you are praised’ (as it is by most tr.), since
the passive can’t govern an object, and ‘doors’ would be quite an outlandish object
anyway.
My interpr. starts with the two things I think we can hold onto:</p>
<ol>
<li>the collocation ví dúraḥ inevitably brings to mind the idiom ví dúraḥ √vṛ
‘open the doors’, used inter alia for the breaking of dawn, which is also often
homologized to the opening of the Vala cave (e.g., VII.79.4), an act ascribed to Indra.
This is mentioned several times in this Indra cycle (VI.17.6, 18.5, 30.5). Thus the
most likely way to interpr. the first part of 5b śū́ro yác chakra ví dúraḥ is as a rel. cl.
8
referring to this action, supplying the verb √vṛ (or sim.): “When, o able one, as
champion you (open[ed]) wide the doors.” If we thus interpr. the rel. cl., the
supposed passive gṛṇīṣé is displaced from its supposed role as verb in that clause
(though we could, of course, assume the ‘open’ idiom was participial and gṛṇīṣé
could then be the main verb).</li>
<li>gṛṇīṣe (generally unaccented) is otherwise almost entirely a 1st sg. -se form,
“I (shall) sing/praise,” so the passive interpr. just mentioned is not attractive in any
case. In the last vs. of a hymn such an assertion of a 1st ps. praiser is certainly
apposite and expected.
The gist of my interpr. rests on these two observations. I take gṛṇīṣé as a 1st
sg. and not part of the dependent clause, which expresses the formulaic ‘open the
doors’. gṛṇīṣé’s object is vṛjánam at the beginning of the hemistich. The verb gṛṇīṣé
is accented because it immediately follows a subord. clause. The major problem that
I see is that this requires that the yád clause be embedded, and I don’t see any way
out of that. I would also prefer if Indra were the object of the praise, not (merely) the
vṛjánam. He might indeed be represented by the init. tám, which would then not
modify vṛjánam. This would produce an alternative tr. “Him here and now do I sing,
as (I do/did) otherwise the community, when …”
I am not entirely satisfied with this interpr., but I do not have anything better
to offer (nor do other interpr.).
The rest of the vs. is much less problematic. The most important thing to note
is that the dhenú- ‘milk-cow’ must be masc. because of the adj. śukradúghasya
‘having bright/clear milk’. This gender not only goes against nature, but also against
the phrase in 4c sudúghām … dhenúm, with the fem. adj. sudúghām. The gender
switch is obviously deliberate, and the likely reason for it was already formulated by
Sāy.: that this is a reference to the soma-plant and the soma juice that is milked out of
it. (Both Ge and Schmidt take the two genitives separately, which rescues the gender
of dhenóḥ but ignores the shock value of the gender switch.)
That pāda b has to do with opening the Vala cave is supported by the mention
of the Aṅgirases in d.
Also in d, bráhmaṇā is ring-compositionally related to bráhma in 1a.</li>

<h3 id="vi361">VI.36.1</h3>
<p>Although the stem viśvá-janya- is of course a bahuvrīhi and has the basic
meaning ‘possessing all peoples’ vel sim., the point here must be that all peoples
prepare soma for Indra, hence my ‘stemming from all peoples’ referring to the soma
drinks. The reciprocity between the people’s offering of exhilarating drinks and
Indra’s apportioning of prizes (c) is clear.
The publ. tr. renders the injunc. dhāráyathāḥ as a present; it could also have
past value: “when/as you upheld …”
As it is elsewhere (cf. W. E. Hale, Ásura- in Early Vedic Religion, 59–62),
asuryà- ‘lordship’ is ascribed to Indra, and the fact that he maintains this lordship
‘among the gods’ (devéṣu) demonstrates once again that devá- / ásura- is not yet an
9
antithetical or hostile pairing in the RV. This same Indra cycle contains a similar
expression: VI.20.2 ánu … asuryàṃ devébhir dhāyi víśvam.</p>
<h3 id="vi362">VI.36.2</h3>
<p>Since verbal forms of √yaj are not otherwise found with ánu nor does the
lexeme ánu-prá √yaj occur anywhere else, I take ánu prá yeje as a technical
reference to the fore- and after-offerings (prayājá-, anuyājá-, already attested in late
RV). The ánu may have been included because of the idiom ánu √dā ‘concede’ in
the next pāda. On the weak pf. form yeje (versus īje) see comm. ad I.114.2 and Kü
391–92.
Contra Ge, Klein (DGRV I:224–25), and Scar (115–16), who take c with d, I
construe b and c together, with the two datives vīryā̀ya (b) and syūmagṛ́bhe
dúdhaye ’rvate (c) parallel to each other and serving as the indirect object to dadhire
ánu ‘have conceded’ in b. This allows ca at the end of c to take its usual role
conjoining NPs, rather than serving as a clausal conjunction (joining b and cd) as
Klein is forced to take it. In either case the ca is unusually positioned, but as a clausal
conjunction its position might be more jarring.
This interpr. also allows a better case frame in d: ápi √vṛj krátum + LOC is an
idiom of subordination; cf. X.48.3 máyi devā́so ’vṛjann ápi krátum “To me have the
gods bent their will” (sim. X.120.3). But for both Ge and Klein the dative of c must
take the place of the usual loc.; e.g., Klein “And to (him), the bucking courser
grabbing the reins, do they direct their determination in the battle against the
obstacle.” In my interpr. I supply a loc. ‘to him’ in d, likely gapped because of the
presence of the circumstantial loc. ‘at the smashing of Vṛtra/obstacles’ (vrtrahátye),
with the dat. of c more naturally construed with the verb in b, ánu √dhā, which
ordinarily takes a dative.
With Gr, Ge, and Klein, I take the root noun cmpd. syūma-gṛ́bh- in c as
having the transitive value “pulling at [/grabbing] the reins,” expressing the
impatience of the “headstrong charger” that is Indra. Curiously, Scar (115–16) gives
it the passive sense “der … beim Zügel gepackt wird,” indicating that the same
headstrong charger has to be reined in. Although this interpr. is in principle possible,
in practice it seems unlikely that the poets would dare to consider (much less desire)
curbing Indra’s impetuous rush.</p>
<h3 id="vi363">VI.36.3</h3>
<p>I take fem. pl. sadhrī́cīḥ as implicitly modifying all the NPs, though
attracted to the gender of the adjacent noun, fem. ūtáyaḥ. So, it seems, also Ge.</p>
<h3 id="vi365">VI.36.5</h3>
<p>In b Ge takes rā́yaḥ as subject and supplies the same stem as obj., on which
gen. sg. aryáḥ is dependent, while apparently supplying a form of the same root
√sthā (or √as) with abhí as I do: “Wie der Himmel über der Erde, so (sollen) die
Reichtümer sich über die (der) hohen Herren (erheben)” (sim. Thieme, Fremd. 59).
The publ. tr. is different, in taking rā́yaḥ as an acc. despite the accent (expect *rāyáḥ,
but the nom. form is sometimes found for the acc.) and supplying Indra as subject of
a supplied impv. to abhí √sthā (/as): “Like heaven over the earth, sur(mount) the
riches of the stranger.” However, I now see that Ge must be correct, because the
10
expression here has to be interpr. alongside similar phrasing elsewhere in this Indra
cycle: VI.20.1 dyaúr ná … abhí bhū́ma aryás, tasthaú ráyiḥ …, which I tr. “wealth
… surmounts (the wealth) of the stranger, … as heaven does the earth.” This passage
contains the same two-term simile dyaúr ná (…) bhū́ma, the same NP ráyi- aryáḥ,
and the same preverb abhí. However, it is more explicit, in having an overt finite
verb tastháu, and, most important, in having an undeniable nominative ráyiḥ, which
must correspond to dyaúḥ in the simile. The publ. tr. of our passage should therefore
be altered to “Like heaven over the earth, let (our) riches sur(mount) (those) of the
stranger.”
Ge takes cakānáḥ in c as passive: “auf dass du … bei uns beliebt seiest.” But
the pf. cake, including its fairly frequent participle cakāná-, is always “active” in
sense: ‘take pleasure, desire’; cf. Kü 142–43. In the publ. tr. I moved the instr. śávasā
immediately preceding the part. to be construed with the 2nd part. cékitānaḥ, as a
parallel to váyasā (“showing yourself with your strength and your vigor …”). I am
now uncertain about this because of two similar passages: V.3.10 … sáhasā cakānáḥ
with an s-stem instr. as here and VII.27.1 … śávasaś cakānáḥ with a gen. of the same
s-stem as here, both immediately preceding cakānáḥ as here. Although I still don’t
think śávasā should be construed directly with cakānáḥ as the source of enjoyment, I
now think it probably should remain in the larger participial phrase: “so that you
with your strength will keep finding enjoyment in us …”</p>
<h2 id="vi37-indra">VI.37 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="vi371">VI.37.1</h3>
<p>I take svàrvān as implicitly conjoined with kīríḥ, with the pair displaying the
range of mortals who call upon Indra. This is one of Old’s suggestions; alternatively
he suggests that it is proleptic, but this seems overly complex — though it seems to
underlie Ge’s interpr.: “denn auch die Arme ruft dich erleuchtet.”
VI.37.1–2: On the shift in referent between the hárayaḥ in 1b (Indra’s horses) and
the one in 2a (soma drops) see publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="vi372">VI.37.2</h3>
<p>Accented asyá in c presupposes the gen. phrase in d mádasya somyásya,
even though the two genitives are construed differently: the one in c as (partitive)
gen. with √pā ‘drink’, the one in d dependent on rā́jā.
VI.37.2–3: The implicit identification of Indra’s horses with the soma drops is
reinforced by the use of the part. ṛ́jyantaḥ for both (2b, 3c).</p>
<h3 id="vi373">VI.37.3</h3>
<p>It is not possible to respect the hemistich boundary in tr. without
awkwardness.</p>
<h3 id="vi374">VI.37.4</h3>
<p>Ge (fld. by Klein, DGRV I: 250) takes váriṣṭhaḥ as an ex. of hypallage.
standing for *váriṣṭhām and characterizing the dákṣiṇā. This must be because they
take the adj. as meaning ‘broadest’, splv. to urú- (though I don’t quite see why the
11
priestly gift could be broad if Indra cannot be). By contrast I follow Gr in consider
some forms of the stem váriṣṭha- as ‘choicest, most excellent’, a splv. to vára-
‘choice’, though of course that adj. should not, originally, produce a primary splv.
(Note, however, that *váratama- would be metrically unfavorable.) AiG II.2.452–53
allows such a splv. in late Vedic, though not for our period, but I see no reason why
it can’t be early, encouraged by semantically and phonologically parallel vásiṣṭḥa-
‘best’ (à Vasiṣṭha).
Ge and Klein also take the ca in 4d as subordinating d to c (cf. Klein “through
which … thou dost avoid straitened circumstances, when … though dost deal out the
gifts of the lord”). I do not understand the need for this. Since pāda c is a rel. cl. beg.
with yáyā, there is no reason that d cannot still be in the domain of that relative,
accounting for the accented verb dáyase, and the action of d does not seem logically
subordinate to that in c. I therefore take ca here as conjoining parallel subordinate
clauses.
In fact, d is a better candidate for rel. cl. with yáyā than c is: assuming that
yáyā refers to the dákṣiṇā of pāda a, it easily makes sense with d: “with which
(priestly gift) you distributed …,” but rather less sense with c. Why should the
dákṣiṇā enable Indra to avoid áṃhas-? In fact, I wonder if, at least in c, the passage
has been adapted from an expression with a different feminine referent. Perhaps a
passage like II.34.15a yáyā radhrám pāráyathā́ti áṃhaḥ “with which you carry the
feeble one across difficult straits” (with both yáyā and áṃhaḥ, polarized as here),
where the referent of yáyā is ūtíḥ ‘help’ (15c).
The last item on which I disagree with Ge (/Klein) is the function/identity of
sūrī́n. Flg. Ludwig, they take this as standing for the gen. pl. (hence, “the bounties of
our patrons”). But there is no need for this, as Old also points out, since the apparent
acc. pl. can be syntactically accommodated &ndash; either as a parallel to maghā́
(“apportion bounties [and] patrons”) or, as both Old and I prefer, in a double acc.
construction with dáyase ví: “apportion bounties (to) patrons.” The point of the latter
is that the patrons are the middlemen between the gods and the priest/poets: Indra
gives the sūrí- riches and they redistribute them to the ritual workers. It would seem
odd indeed to have Indra distributing riches that already belonged to the patrons, as
the genitive would imply.</p>
<h3 id="vi375">VI.37.5</h3>
<p>As the last pāda of this vs. shows, Indra is the ultimate super-patron.</p>
<h2 id="vi38-indra">VI.38 Indra</h2>
<p>The publ. intro. states that reference is unclear in the hymn “until the last pāda
of vs. 2”; this is somewhat misleading, in that a form of índra- is found in the second
pāda of vs. 2 &ndash; though the identity of the other referent there remains cloudy.</p>
<h3 id="vi381">VI.38.1</h3>
<p>The unclear reference just noted is found in the first word of the hymn, 3rd
sg. aor. ápāt ‘he has drunk’, whose subject is not expressed. On the one hand, this is
an Indra hymn and Indra is the prototypical drinker of soma (cf., e.g., the opening of
nearby VI.40.1 índra piba, as well as ápāḥ in the 1st vs. of the next hymn, nearly
12
identical to our verb and with Indra clearly meant as subj.), so we might expect Indra
as subject. On the other, the most likely referent of the almost immediately following
nominative citrátamaḥ, who bears the invocation upward, is Agni, and as the mouth
of the gods, he can also be considered to drink (though not usually soma). Parsimony
might suggest that the two unidentified subjects in the first hemistich are identical,
hence Agni. In the publ. tr. I supply Agni, with ?, but I am not at all certain that the
first subject isn’t Indra. Or, more likely, that the poet meant to leave it open.
The subject of cd is also left unspecified; again I assume Agni: if he is
embarking upward in ab, then the journey (yā́man) in c is most likely his, though Ge
supplies Indra. The only nominative attribute, sudā́nuḥ, is no help, as it is used of
Agni and Indra about equally. What I take from the uncertainties of reference in this
vs. is that the poet wants to keep us guessing.
The pāda-final splv. citrátamaḥ produces a bad Triṣṭubh cadence. There is no
obvious way to fix it, and the other 5 instances of this stem are found elsewhere in
the line, where they work metrically.
VI.38.1–2: As noted in the publ. intro., I think vs. 2 functions as complementary to 1:
in the first vs. the índra-hūti- is conveyed up to Indra (presumably in heaven); in 2 he
&ndash; and his ears &ndash; are brought down here to the devá-hūti- performed at the sacrifice.</p>
<h3 id="vi382">VI.38.2</h3>
<p>In b ghóṣāt is morphologically ambiguous: it can be a subjunctive to the
them. pres. ghóṣa- (accented because first in its pāda) or the abl. to the them. noun
ghóṣa- (so Gr). For possible interpr. involving this abl., see Old. By contrast I follow
Ge (and Lub) in taking it as a verb form, parallel to tanyati later in the pāda. The
major problem this interpr. poses is how to construe gen. índrasya. Under the abl.
interpr. of ghóṣāt, the gen. is dependent on that noun, but without that support it must
find another role in the following clause (to which it must belong, because tanyati is
unaccented and cannot start a new clause). With Ge (n. 2b) I take it as loosely
construed with bruvāṇáḥ, though in a different sense from Ge’s “der sich zu Indra
Bekennende” &ndash; rather as the topic of the speech.
As for the subject of ghóṣāt and tanyati, I think it anticipates the deváhūti- of
c. This of course creates a problem of its own, in that bruvāṇáḥ should be fem. if
deváhūti- is the referent. But given the poet’s general evasiveness about referents, I
think in b we’re dealing with an as-yet-unidentified verbal product, which is then
specified as deváhūti- (the same índra-hūti- of 1b) in c.
VI.38.2–4: After the absence of overt referents in vs. 1, starting with 2b we have a
form of índra- in every hemistich through vs. 4 (2b índrasya, 2d índram, 3b índram,
3d índre, 4a índram, 4d índram). His name is again absent in the final vs. of the
hymn, vs. 5, suggesting that this pattern is deliberate and a species of ring
composition, marked by absence not presence. The next hymn (VI.39) also shows
this structure, with the three middle verses (2–4) united by the shared initial deictic
ayám and the first and last (1, 5) standing out against this pattern.
13</p>
<h3 id="vi383">VI.38.3</h3>
<p>As usual, the enclitic vaḥ ‘for you’ refers to the priestly colleagues of the
poet on whose behalf he acts; as is also usual, the Engl. tr. has to be heavier and more
prominent than the recessive 2nd position accentless vaḥ.
The second hemistich contains, in my view, a double ca construction
conjoining two clauses, in which the first verb, dadhiré, is accented (and the 2nd,
vardhat, is not). Klein (DGRV I.176–77) notes that the whole could be interpr. “as a
sentential X ca Y ca construction” (as I do), but favors separating the functions of the
two ca-s, taking the first ca as conjoining the two nouns in the sequence bráhmā ca
gíraḥ, while he allows (DGRV I.226–27) that the 2nd ca is a clausal conjunction. This
seems like a desperate makeshift to avoid the (to me, at least) obvious connection
between the two ca-s— esp. as it requires that in bráhmā ca gíraḥ the usual X Y ca
construction be replaced by the much less usual inversion, Y ca X (or in Klein’s
parlance, X ca Y: DGRV I.169ff.). (According to Klein [DGRV I.51 and 169], there
are 464 occurrences of X Y ca and 45 of X ca Y &ndash; a factor of 10.) In my opinion, the
accented dadhiré is an example of the usual type of contrastive verb accent, and the
ca … ca construction is a hyped version of “both … and,” viz., “not only … but
also.”
In d ádhi vardhat is syntactically somewhat problematic. It lacks an overt acc.
obj., even though active forms of várdha- (and other stems to this root) are
overwhelmingly transitive &ndash; a value reinforced by no less than 4 pāda-initial
occurrences of transitive active várdha- in the very next vs. (4a + b várdhāt, 4c
várdha, 4d várdhān), all with Indra as explicit or implied object! It is inconceivable
to me that Indra is not meant as the object in 3d as well, despite locative índre in this
pāda, but I seem to be alone it that view. Note Ge’s intransitive “&rsquo;&hellip; möge an Indra
stark werden,” fld. by Klein (177) “will find strength in Indra.” Gotō (1st Klasse, 291)
sees the problem, but suggests that “we” are the gapped object: “&rsquo;&hellip;macht [uns?] bei
Indra stark.” In my opinion, the aberrant loc. is conditioned by ádhi, which when
independent often takes a loc. (see Gr, s.v. ádhi, p. 45, nos. 13–17). ádhi √vṛdh is
found only here, and once in the middle (IX.75.1), in all of Skt. acdg. to MonWms.
My “puts strength in Indra” reflects the transitive periphrasis I see in this lexeme.
The syntactically clearer forms of act. várdha- in the next vs. can be viewed as a type
of poetic repair.</p>
<h3 id="vi384">VI.38.4</h3>
<p>The singular number of both forms of várdhāt (a, b) is worthy of a small
note. The subject of the first is the conjoined NP yajñá utá sómaḥ, with 2 singular
nouns. As often, the verb agrees with one of them (presumably the nearer one),
rather than being in the dual, as would also be possible. In b the subject is the even
more complex NP bráhma gíra ukthā́ca mánma, of which the two middle terms are
clearly plural (fem. and neut. respectively), while the two neut. -n-stems that
bookend the phrase, bráhma and mánma, could be either sg. or pl. Flg. Ge (sim.
Klein DGRV I.198–99), I take the first as sg. and the last as pl., again assuming that
the verb agrees with the nearer term, namely bráhma. But it is possible that bráhma
is actually pl. and that this is an ex. of the famous but fairly rare construction of a sg.
verb with a neut. pl. subj. Although there is no way to tell, I’m tempted to alter the tr.
14
to pl.: “… the sacred formulations will strengthen,” given the undoubted pl. of the
two middle terms and the possible pl. of the last one.
yā́man reprises the same word in 1c, though they have somewhat different
meanings.
Although nom. pl. dyā́vaḥ ordinarily refers to ‘heavens’, in this case the
context clearly establishes the meaning ‘days’.</p>
<h3 id="vi385">VI.38.5</h3>
<p>The half-verse boundary has to be breeched in tr. to avoid awkwardness.
After the spate of act. transitive forms of √vṛdh in vs. 4 (and 3d), the middle
pf. part. vāvṛdhānám provides a contrastive intransitive/passive, agreeing with Indra,
the object of the transitive forms.
Contra Ge, I take ásāmi with vāvṛdhānám despite the pāda boundary, on the
basis of VI.19.2 yó vāvrdhé ás ̥ āmi in this same Indra cycle.
On the ca in b, see Klein, DGRV I.54–55.</p>
<h2 id="vi39-indra">VI.39 Indra</h2>
<p>The whole hymn is tr. and disc. by Schmidt (B+I 149–51).</p>
<h3 id="vi391">VI.39.1</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the NP in the gen. that occupies the first
hemistich (and part of pāda c) remains unresolved until the governing verb, ápāḥ
‘you have drunk’, which opens the second hemistich. The referent of this phrase &ndash;
namely soma &ndash; also remains unresolved until the very end of pāda b, with the tip-off
mádhvaḥ ‘of the honey’. (Though initial mandrásya ‘gladdening’ might appear to
point to soma, in fact it’s far more often used of Agni.)
VI.39.2–4: As noted in the publ. intro. (and see comm. ad VI.38.2–4 above), the
three middle verses are marked by repeated use of the near deictic in pāda-initial
position, beginning every hemistich but 2cd and coming to a crescendo in vs. 4 with
three iterations: ayám 2a, ayám 3a, imám 3c, ayám 4a, b, c. The unidentified referent
of all these deictic forms is soma — see Old’s disc. — but soma at least partially
identified with Indra, as the opener of the Vala cave. The repeated use of the deitic,
pointing to something in the immediate vicinity of the speaker, focuses on soma as
the ritual substance on the sacrificial ground.
The three vss. also share an etymological figure type, with transitive
(/causative) verb taking a negated object to the same root: 2c rujád árugṇam, 3a
dyotayad adyútaḥ, 4a rocayad arúcaḥ. And the presence of the preverb ví in pādainterior in each vs. (2c, 3a, 4b) is another shared feature.
On vss. 3–4 see Hoffmann, Injunk. 142–43.</p>
<h3 id="vi392">VI.39.2</h3>
<p>The first pāda is truncated, though the frequency of the Vala theme and the
stereotyped phraseology associated with it easily allow the missing parts to be
supplied. With páry ádrim usrā́ḥ we can add the part. sántam, as in IV.1.15 gā́ḥ …
pári ṣántam ádrim “… the rock surrounding the cows” (cf. VI.17.5). As for the verb,
√ruj is the (or a) standard root for this mythological action (cf. nearby VI.32.2 rujád
15
ádrim), and ruját opening pāda c can serve in the first hemistich as well. (Scar [425]
unaccountably supplies “ging” instead.)
The second pāda contains an elementary etymological figure, with the root
noun cmpd ṛtayúj- flanked by its component parts: ṛtá(-dhītibhir) ṛtayúg yujānáḥ.
The publ. tr. renders the first cmpd. as “by those of true insight,” implying that ṛtá- is
adjectival, and the second as “the one whose yoke is truth,” implying that it is a
bahuvrīhi. I would alter this tr. to “the one yoked with truth, having been yoked by
those whose insights are truth (that is, the priest/poets).”
The third pāda also contains a simple etymological figure: rujád árugṇam “he
breaks the unbreakable.”
In d Ge, Schmidt (149), and Scar (425) all take yodhat as a preterite (e.g., Ge
‘bekämpfte’), but I don’t see how it can be anything but a root aor. subjunctive (so
explicitly Macd. VGS, 410). If this analysis is correct, it makes it likely that the
injunc. ruját in c also falls in the present/future (or perhaps, in Hoffmann’s terms,
zeitlos) realm. Note that Hoffmann (Injunk. 142–43) so interprets the following two
vss. (3–4), which, as we’ve seen, pattern closely with vs. 2. Nonetheless the three
scholars just mentioned take all of vs. 2 as preterital, whereas I consider this to be an
instance of the reconfiguring of mythological deeds as actions we hope to be
repeated in the current time.
Old wants to emend índraḥ in d to voc. indra, to allow soma to be the subject
of yodhat as it is of the rest of the vs., and he points to this same voc. indra at the end
of the next hemistich (3b). However, it is hard to see why the first of two identical
forms would be redactionally altered to be different from the second, and the shifting
conceptual boundary between soma and Indra as agents in this sequence makes the
transmitted text unproblematic, as Old also admits.</p>
<h3 id="vi393">VI.39.3</h3>
<p>The identity of ayám as soma is fixed by índuḥ ‘drop’ towards the end of b,
but not until fairly late in this sequence. The play of índu- and índra- so prominent in
Maṇḍala IX is found here in their adjacency at the end of the hemistich.</p>
<h3 id="vi394">VI.39.4</h3>
<p>Whether the referent of the ‘unshining’ (arúcaḥ) is the same as that of the
‘unlit’ (adyútaḥ) of 3a, namely the nights (aktū́n 3a), is unclear. Hoffmann suggests
so, with ?, and I see nothing against it. Both adyút- and arúc- are hapaxes in the RV,
so we can’t bring to bear other usages of these words.
Ge (explicitly n. 2b) considers ṛtayúj- here as having a different sense from
the same cmpd. in vs. 2: “mit dem Recht im Bunde” (2b) versus “mit den rechtzeitig
geschirrten Rossen” (4c). Even if ṛtá- ever had the sense ‘timely, punctual’ (which it
does not), it is inconceivable to me that in a hymn of this length, the poet would use
the same cmpd. in two very different senses, within two vss. of each other and
marking the boundaries of an omphalos. Schmidt (149) also considers this unlikely,
though he attributes the contrary view to Lüders, who, as far as I can see, doesn’t
hold it or at least explicitly state it; Scar (425) temporizes in his disc., though he tr.
the other three instances of ṛtayúj- (incl. our vs. 4), all modifying ‘horses’, with the
anodyne ‘wohlgeschirrten’, as opposed to our vs. 2, which he renders ‘der
16
Verbündete des Ṛta’ &ndash; in other words, implicitly following Ge’s differentiation. I
would alter the publ. tr. from “whose yoke is truth” to “yoked with truth,” as in vs. 2.</p>
<h3 id="vi395">VI.39.5</h3>
<p>Note that there are some echoes of vs. 1 in this final vs. The singer in the
dative gṛṇaté is found in both vss., immediately after the caesura (1d, 5a); íṣaḥ
‘refreshments’ opens the pāda in 1d and 5b; and there is a teasing reflection of pādainitial ápā(ḥ) (1c ‘you have drunk’) in pāda-initial apá(ḥ) (5c ‘waters).</p>
<h2 id="vi40-indra">VI.40 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="vi401">VI.40.1</h3>
<p>I take gaṇé as referring to the troop of Maruts, as often, not an unidentified
set of mortals making up a “(Sänger)schar,” as Ge seems to take it. Assuming that it
refers to the Maruts, this provides conceptual ring composition with the final word of
the hymn, marúdbhiḥ, as noted in the publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="vi402">VI.40.2</h3>
<p>In the 2nd hemistich the series of subjects &ndash; the cows, the men, the waters,
and the stone &ndash; detail the various elements, both animate and not, that collaborate to
produce the soma: the cows as the milk to be mixed in, the men who perform the
pressing and the other ritual actions, the waters that both swell the soma stalk and are
mixed with the pressed juices, and the stone used to press the stalks.
As Ge notes (n. 2cd) the final asmai has two possible readings: it can double
te in c, “for you … for that one [=you] to drink,” or it can refer to soma, appearing
earlier in the clause in the acc. phrase tám … índum “this drop.” I favor the latter,
with dat. asmai attracted into the dat. as complement of the dat. infin. pītáye (as subj.,
as in the publ. tr. “for it to be fully drunk,” or as obj. with te as subj. “for you to drink
it fully”). Because the infinitive phrase pītáye sám asmai is separated from the rest of
the clause and repeats the preverb/adverb sám, I favor the former. The use of the
near-deictic asmai for soma, even unaccented, recalls the insistent ayám for soma in
the preceding hymn (vss. 2–4; see comm. ad loc.), and it also forms a little ring in
this vs., with init. ásya (2a) having the same referent as asmai at the end of 2d.</p>
<h3 id="vi403">VI.40.3</h3>
<p>In sandhi the phrase sutá indra sóma ā́is completely ambiguous between
nom. sutáḥ … sómaḥ and loc. suté … sóme. The publ. tr. interprets it as the former,
while the Pp. reads the latter. Although nothing rides on it, I would now be inclined
to follow the Pp., with two parallel loc. absolutes: “with the fire kindled (and) the
soma pressed, let your fallow bays …”</p>
<h3 id="vi404">VI.40.4</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., váyo dhāt here echoes almost the same phrase in
1d váyo dhāḥ (both also introduced by pāda-init. áthā), but with reciprocal switch of
subject and beneficiary: Indra creates vitality for the sacrifice in 1d; the sacrifice
does the same for Indra in 4d.</p>
<h3 id="vi405">VI.40.5</h3>
<p>The disjunctive construction marked by two occurrences of vā ‘or’
describing the possible places where Indra might be contains three non-parallel
17
terms: an adv. ṛ́dhak, a loc. NP své sádane, and a dep. clause with locatival
subordinator yátra &hellip; ási. It is also a nice instance of Behaghel’s Law.
A verb of motion has to be supplied in c, but this is amply anticipated by ā́
yāhi in 3d and 4a. Assuming this impv. should be supplied in c, it rhymes with pāhi
in d.</p>
<h2 id="vi41-indra">VI.41 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="vi412">VI.41.2</h3>
<p>I take váriṣṭhā as a likely pun, not only ‘widest’ (hence a throat that can
accommodate a lot of soma at one gulp), but also ‘best’; cf. disc. ad VI.37.4.
For prá √sthā with soma as expressed or implied obj., cf. I.15.9, VII.92.2,
and, with prásthitam, II.36.4, 37.2.
I do not know the exact semantic nuance of sám √vṛt, but I think it must mean
something more than Ge’s “mitkommen.” I take it here as purposive ‘turn oneself
to’, with gavyúḥ expressing the purpose, but this may be pushing the idiom.</p>
<h3 id="vi413">VI.41.3</h3>
<p>Note that the equational sentence ending d, yás te ánnam, does not show
gender attraction between subj. and pred., as in later Vedic prose, although this
phenomenon is found elsewhere in the RV. See, e.g., X.10.4, 11.8 and comm.
thereon.</p>
<h2 id="vi42-indra">VI.42 Indra</h2>
<p>An uninsistent play on preverbs structures this hymn. práti appears with 3
different verbs in the 1st 3 vss.: práti … bhara 1ab, pratyétana 2a, prati bhū́ṣatha 3b,
while in the last vs. the práti … bhara of vs. 1 is replaced by the more usual
presentation verb prá bhara (4b).</p>
<h3 id="vi422">VI.42.2</h3>
<p>As sometimes elsewhere (I.9.2, VIII.1.17, X.32.8), enam doubles īm in the
phrase ém (that is, ā́+ īm) enam, a pile-up of two acc. enclitics, whose referent is
postponed till the end of the hemistich, somapā́tamam. On this sequence see my
RVic sīm and īm (2002), 302–3 and n. 18.
There is no obvious reason for the accent on pratyétana (Pp. praty étana).
(Old’s [ZDMG 60: 732] ref. is barely a mention and provides no real explanation.)
The assumption about étana is that it is a 2nd pl. impv. of the root pres. of √i, with
unexpected full grade of the root, unexpected verb accent in a main clause, and
unexpected root rather than ending accent (versus itá, though of course the full grade
would account for the root accent). I think rather that it should be analyzed ā́-itana,
with accented preverb contracted with the unaccented expected zero-grade root
syllable of the verb. We would thus have an unaccented verb as expected in this
apparent main clause. But this suggestion raises two problems: 1) when two preverbs
precede an unaccented verb, they should both be accented (though most the exx. I
have identified have verbal material between the 1st and 2nd preverbs), e.g., IV.4.4
práty ā́tanuṣva, and we should therefore expect accented *práty here as well; 2) ā́is
already present pāda-initially in ém. Balanced against these problems is the fact that
18
ā́is usually the 2nd preverb in a complex (see práty-ā́√tan just cited), and the
assumed ā́(…) práti would be quite unusual (almost no such sequences registered in
MonWms). I think we must assume that, more or less simultaneously, ā́was doubled
to serve as clitic host to īm in the frozen sequence ém enam, besides immediately
preceding the verb, and that étana was reinterpr. as simply a full-grade accented
impv. (cf. unaccented etana in V.61.4, on which see comm. ad loc.), not as
containing a preverb — which reinterpretation then induced loss of accent on *práti.
The doubling of ā́is somewhat like the doubling of preverbs sometimes found in the
Gāthās, though there that seems to be a redactional change.</p>
<h3 id="vi423">VI.42.3</h3>
<p>I take yádī as representing yád ī with the enclitic acc. ī, parallel to īm in the
last vs. Note that ī here is pre-C, while īm in 2a is pre-V.
As Ge notes (n. 3cd) there is some uncertainty about the subj. and goal of the
verbs here &ndash; Indra or Soma. I take the subject in both cases to be Indra. In c védā
víśvasya “he knows of it all” echoes 1b víśvāni vidúṣe “to the one who knows all
things,” an unequivocal ref. to Indra. I think there is a contrast between c and d of a
familiar type: Indra could go to any soma ritual (“knows of it all”) but comes just to
our soma (táṃ-tam íd).</p>
<h3 id="vi424">VI.42.4</h3>
<p>The āmreḍita pronoun táṃ-tam íd referring to soma in 3d is then contrasted
with another pronominal āmreḍita, asmā-asmā íd, referring to Indra; the near deictic
announces him as having arrived at the ritual ground, to which he was hastening in
3d.
On the surprising last hemistich, see publ. intro.</p>
<h2 id="vi43-indra">VI.43 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="vi432">VI.43.2</h3>
<p>As Ge points out, this must be a ref. to the three soma-pressings: the
“middle and end” are respectively the Midday Pressing and the Third Pressing; the
“sharp-pressed” refers to the freshly pressed soma of the Morning Pressing, which
must be especially pungent.</p>
<h3 id="vi434">VI.43.4</h3>
<p>The HvN ed. unaccountably omits this vs.</p>
<h2 id="vi44-indra">VI.44 Indra</h2>
<p>VI.44.1–3: In the refrain of pādas cd, the position of sá and of the unaccented
elements indra te strongly suggests that the clause begins in the middle of c &ndash; or
rather that sómaḥ sutáḥ has been extraclausally topicalized. Although in vss. 1–2 this
nom. phrase could belong to the rel. clause of ab, that prospect is foreclosed in vs. 3,
because soma is represented in the rel. cl. of 3ab by the instr. yéna.
I do not understand why this refrain contains an overt form of the copula ásti.
Outside of dependent clauses, overt asti is generally an existential, but that function
is highly unlikely here.
19
In addition to the refrain that unifies all three vss. of this tṛca, the three vss.
are structured by rel. clauses in ab with soma as the referent of the rel. prn.</p>
<h3 id="vi443">VI.44.3</h3>
<p>This vs. subtly undermines the autonomous power of Indra. In the refrain of
all three vss. Indra is addressed as svadhāpate ‘lord of independent power’, but here
in the first hemistich Indra is said to be like (ná) “one grown strong by (his own)
power,” like “one overpowering by his own forms of help” (svā́bhir ūtíbhih). In other
words the power that appears to be Indra’s own (svá-) is really produced for him by
soma.
VI.44.4–6: Although this tṛca does not have glaring signs of unity, it particularly
concerns the songs that strengthen Indra and rouse his aid to us. It also has a subtle
morphological ring; see the disc. of the loc. inf. in 3d.</p>
<h3 id="vi444">VI.44.4</h3>
<p>On áprahan- (or, less likely, áprahaṇa-), see Old, Scar (689). Scar
construes vaḥ with this form (“der nicht auf euch einschlägt”) as well as with gṛṇīṣé
(“… will ich für euch preisen”). I take vaḥ only with gṛṇīṣé and supply ‘us’ with the
root noun cmpd.; Ge likewise takes vaḥ with the verb and supplies “keiner” as obj. of
the cmpd. There is no way to choose and no reason to do so, since all three are more
or less equivalent: Indra is all powerful but does not threaten the community to
which the poet belongs.</p>
<h3 id="vi445">VI.44.5</h3>
<p>The íd in pāda a seems displaced: we would expect yám íd …, though that
order would produce a choppy meter. The íd in c is better positioned, though we
actually might expect it to be limiting asya, not the tám anticipating śúṣmam. The
publ. tr. does not render either íd; if I were to do so, the result would be “(It’s) just
(him) whom the songs make strong … just his tempestuous force that the worldhalves respect.”</p>
<h3 id="vi446">VI.44.6</h3>
<p>This vs. is syntactically more complex and ritually more technical than the
other two vss. in this tṛca.
The most noteworthy form is the loc. inf. upastṛṇīṣáni, a hapax, not
surprisingly. In my opinion it is possible to account for the creation of this form from
context, albeit indirectly. The first vs. of this tṛca contains the well-attested 1st sg.
gṛṇīṣé (4b), belonging to the tight class of -sé 1st sgs. in the ‘praise/sing’ semantic
sphere. Beside gṛṇīṣé there exists a -ṣáni infinitive gṛṇīṣáṇi (2x, incl. once in this
maṇḍala, VI.15.6). I think our poet built upastṛṇīṣáṇi on the model of this gṛṇīṣáṇi,
as a partial echo of gṛṇīṣé in 4b, based on the existence of 9th class presents to both of
these roots. Because it echoes that 1st sg. I interpr. the predicated inf. with 1st ps. ref.
(“it [is mine] to lay …”). Once again, as in 4, the vaḥ refers to the poet’s fellow
officiants.
In the ritual the ‘underlayer’ is the layer of butter spread on the ladle
underneath the principal offering. Here it is used in a doubly metaphorical sense: the
underlayer for Indra could presumably be configured physically as the barhis on
20
which he would sit, but at another metaphorical remove it could refer to the
recitations that provide him with a figurative foundation.
The poet then, by a clever trick, mobilizes this underlayer of words to serve as
a metaphor for the multiplication of Indra’s forms of help for us. This is
accomplished by means of a simile: vípo ná … ūtáyaḥ “forms of help like inspired
words,” thus implicitly equating the two. These vípaḥ ‘inspired words’ (not, with Ge,
‘fingers’) are ours, in fact the very ukthá- found in pāda a, dependent on barháṇā.
The connection between the two is suggested by the phrase barháṇā vipáḥ “by the
power of inspired speech” in VIII.63.7 (vipáḥ there is gen. sg., as opposed to our
nom. pl. vípaḥ, as the accent shows). In cd the poet asserts that like our hymns, which
rise to Indra, spreading from their position as interconnected (sakṣítaḥ ‘dwelling
together’) underlayer, his forms of help will similarly grow up and out. On this vs.
see also Scar (97).
VI.44.7–9: On the meter of this tṛca see Old, Proleg. 91 and HvN metrical comm.
The fading in and out between Virāj and Triṣṭubh is further complicated by the
openings of 3 in 11-syllable lines in 7b, c.
The tṛca concerns soma and contains lexical and thematic responsions.</p>
<h3 id="vi447">VI.44.7</h3>
<p>The medial pf. part. papāná- is one of only 3 forms of the middle pf. in the
RV, 2 of which, incl. this one, are used passively. See Kü (309). Note that a deriv. of
the other root √pā ‘protect’, pāyúḥ, is found in the 2nd hemistich.
The vs. is notable for a number of hapaxes: acait, staulā́-, and dhautárī, the
latter two also marked by vṛddhi.
On acait as a nonce s-aor. to √cit ‘perceive’, see Narten (114).
staulā́- here is reminiscent of the likewise impenetrable stauná- in this same
maṇḍala VI.66.5. No remotely credible guesses have been proposed for these forms,
or for dhautárī-; Ge (n. 7c): “ganz dunkel” and he fails to tr. the NP; Old: “Über
staulā́bhir dhautárībhiḥ scheint kein Ergebnis erreichbar”; EWA (II.762 and I.783)
also throws up its hands. I am inclined to connect staulā́- and stauná- with similar
words but with aspirated initial sth-, namely sthūrá- ‘brawny, sturdy’ and sthū́ṇā-
‘post’ (see comm. ad VI.66.5) respectively, but I cannot explain the phonological
discrepancy.
As for dhautárī-, Old tentatively suggests that it might belong with one of the
roots √dhāv ‘run’ or ‘rinse’. For translational convenience I have assumed the
former, but without any conviction. In any case the striking double vṛddhi -au- of
these paired nominals must be meant to draw attention to the phrase.</p>
<h3 id="vi448">VI.44.8</h3>
<p>The passive interpr. of the pf. part. papāná- in 7b is affirmed by the pass.
aor. apāyi in 8a.
Similarly, the second pāda clarifies the sense of 7b, where it was said that
soma “has perceived what is better for the gods.” What is better seems to be the
gods’ intent, announced here in 8b, to achieve glory. The VP mánas √kṛ generally
21
means ‘set one’s mind on/to’; cf. V.61.7, I.54.9, II.26.2=VIII.19.20 (though V.30.4
and X.117.2 are outliers).
The forms grouped by Gr under a stem mahás-, an adj. meaning ‘gross’,
generally have other interpr., either adverbial or belonging to a diff. stem (e.g., gen.
sg. to máh-). Although a suffix-accented adj. mahás- built by accent shift to neut.
máhas- ‘greatness’ would fit the standard pattern (type yáśas- ‘glory’ à yaśás-
‘glorious’), the realization of the pattern in this lexical item seems to have been rare
to non-existent. In this passage most (Gr, Ge) do take maháḥ as a neut. adj. to this
stem, modifying nā́ma (“acquiring a great name”), but because of the general
avoidance of such an adj. I prefer to take maháḥ as the masc. nom. sg. to mahá-, a
quotation of the name he received.
In keeping with the interpr. of the root √ven as ‘track, trace, seek’, I interpr.
its grdv. venyá-, when not a PN, as ‘(worthy) to be tracked/sought’.</p>
<h3 id="vi449">VI.44.9</h3>
<p>This tṛca-final vs. reprises and repurposes some of the statements in the
opening vs. 7. The skill (dákṣa-) that Soma found in 7a we ask him to bestow on us
in 9a. Soma, “having won” (sasavā́n) in 7c, is asked to help us in winning (sātaú …
aviḍḍhi) in 9d. Unfortunately nothing in 9 sheds light on the problematic instr. phrase
in 7c.
VI.44.10-12: This tṛca foresees various disasters and tribulations and asks Indra for
his help in combatting them.</p>
<h3 id="vi4410">VI.44.10</h3>
<p>I am not sure of the exact nuance of √bhū + DAT. Gr takes it as meaning
‘angehören, eigen sein’, with a rare dat. here, instead of the gen. usual in this idiom
(his no. 13). Ge renders it thus (“dir … haben wir uns zu eigen gegeben”). Even with
the gen., Gr identifies very few passage with this value, and most of these should be
otherwise interpr., and I also wonder about an augmented aor. in such a sense. The
publ. tr. is by contrast “we have become ready for you,” and I think something like
this is the intention (perhaps “we are here for you”). We are awaiting his advent at
the ritual and the generosity he will display there, but there is some worry that he
will fail to show up, as the 2nd clause of the 1st hemistich shows.
Note that the fairly rare root √ven appears here soon after the appearance of
its deriv. venyá- in 8d. It is possible that this lexical association led to the grafting of
this tṛca onto the previous one in this loose collection of short hymns.</p>
<h3 id="vi4411">VI.44.11</h3>
<p>On niṣṣídh- see comm. ad III.51.5.</p>
<h3 id="vi4412">VI.44.12</h3>
<p>The morphological identity and syntactic function of maghónaḥ in d are
unclear. See esp. Old’s disc. It can be either acc. pl. or gen.-abl. sg. (or an irregular
nom. pl., a possibility that Old considers and dismisses). The problem is that in
neither case would it form part of a standard construction with the verb ā́√dabh. Ge
(n. 12d) thinks of a double acc.: “trick (our) benefactors out of you” &ndash; that is, the
non-giving ones might scare Indra off from our sacrifice or get their invitation to him
22
first, thereby depriving our maghavans of Indra’s presence. This certainly conforms
to a regular worry that sacrificers express, but the construction is unprecedented. Old
opts for the abl. sg. The purport of his interpr. is essentially the same as Ge’s: that the
non-givers not trick Indra away from (abl.) the maghavan, which he sees as our
human patron. The publ. tr. follows Old, though it might be clearer if it were “… not
trick you away from (our) benefactor.” Although this construction is also
unprecedented, adding an oblique complement to a transitive construction seems less
radical to me than investing it with a second acc. However, I now see another
problem with the Old solution: the tṛca opens with a voc. maghavan addressed to
Indra (10a), so it might be odd to have another sg. form of this stem referring to a
human. And I don’t see how to construe an abl. maghónaḥ referring to Indra in the
same construction that contains an acc. tvā with the same reference. Nevertheless, I
still favor Old’s interpr. and simply allow for this shift of reference; such a shift from
divine to human is also necessary if the form is taken as plural, with Ge. There is
another possibility, raised and dismissed by Old, that maghónaḥ is in fact acc. pl., but
the two acc. are conjoined: “mögen nicht die Nichtgeber dich betrügen (und) die
Spender.” This is not outside the realm of possibility.
VI.44.13–15: Another soma tṛca.</p>
<h3 id="vi4413">VI.44.13</h3>
<p>The first hemistich contains disharmony of number in a constructio ad
sensum: The priest is urged to offer of the pressed (soma-drink)s in the plural
(sutā́nām); the reason for this is immediately given in the 2nd part of pāda b, sá hy
àsya rā́jā “for he is its king.” Unaccented singular asya presupposes a referent
already in the discourse, with “it” referring to soma, represented in the previous
clause as a plural. The singular is then continued in the rest of the tṛca (asyá 14a, tám
… sómam 14cd, sutám … sómam 15a, with sg. sutám picking up pl. sutā́nām of 13a).</p>
<h3 id="vi4414">VI.44.14</h3>
<p>As Ge point out (n. 14a), the “many shapes” (purú várpāṃsi) that Indra
knows could either be his own (given his penchant for shape-shifting) or those of the
various demonic enemies he destroys. I assume that the poet meant to leave it
ambiguous, though it’s worth noting that the one instance of the bahuvrīhi puruvárpas- refers to Indra (though in the late hymn X.120.6).
The hapax -si impv. hoṣi has no structural support in the RV, the only aor.
attested being the pass. aor. áhāvi. However, an act. s-aor. is reasonably well attested
in Vedic prose, beginning with the BYV Saṃhitās (ahauṣīt, etc.); see Narten
(Sig.Aor. 288). It is difficult to know whether yoṣi is indirect evidence for a s-aor.
subjunctive to this aor., *hoṣat, etc., to which hoṣi would ultimately belong, or
whether it was created as a nonce beside the other -si impvs. in this ritual sphere such
as yákṣi, mátsi and has nothing to do with the aor. forms in prose. I weakly favor the
latter explanation.</p>
<h3 id="vi4415">VI.44.15</h3>
<p>The vs. is characterized by three root-accented agent nouns (pā́tā a, hántā
b, gántā c), all pāda-initial, all with acc. obj./goal. Then in d the pattern is switched: a
23
suffix-accented agent noun (avitā́), interior in its pāda (immed. after caesura) with
(objective) gen. complement. All of them are presumably predicates of astu in pāda
a. I consider this simply an instance of the RVic tendency to shake up established
patterns; I doubt that the poet is attempting to draw a distinction between Indra’s
habitual roles as drinker, smiter, and goer, in contrast to a situational role as helper,
as Tichy claims (Die Nomen agentis auf -tar- im Vedischen, 298–99; cf. 257 and
passim). Among other things, “help” is one of the most frequent things we ask Indra
to do for us; it is surely one of his standard, habitual roles. It happens that there is no
root-accented *ávitar-, though avitár- is extremely common, and so no such form
was available to match the first three -tar- stems in this vs. I do not know if the gap is
accidental or systemic.
Note that kārúdhāyas-, a rare bv., reappears here from 12 &ndash; again, a possible
reason for attaching this tṛca to the preceding one.
VI.44.16–18: Here the power of soma to rouse Indra to beneficial action is the
general subject of the tṛca. The three forms belonging to √pā ‘drink’ in the 1st
hemistich, pā́tram ‘drinking cup’, indrapā́nam ‘giving drink to Indra’, and apāyi ‘has
been drunk’, in echoing the first word of the preceding vs. (15a pā́tā ‘drinker’), may
have caused this tṛca to be grafted onto the last.</p>
<h3 id="vi4416">VI.44.16</h3>
<p>Ge takes índrasya as agent of apāyi (“Indra hat seinen lieben Göttertrank
getrunken”), but finite passives, even verbs of consumption, don’t take genitive
agents.
VI.44.17–18: These two vss. contain two exx. of unexpectedly accented 2nd sg.
impvs.: 17a jahí and 18d kṛṇuhí, both internal to the pāda and preceded by material
belonging to the same clause. Old cites both (in a list of other puzzling passages;
ZDMG 60: 736), but provides no real explanation. In both cases it is possible to
construct ad hoc justifications. For the jahí of 17a, note that 17d also contains an
accented form of this same impv. (though with metrically lengthened final) in the
sequence prá mṛṇā jahī́ca, where jahī́contrasts with the immediately preceding
impv. prá mṛṇā and has its accent honestly, as it were. It could be that jahí in pāda a
received the accent redactionally or as a poetic imitation of the jahī́later in the vs. As
for kṛṇuhí in 18d, it might be taken as contrastive with the (rather distant)
imperativally used injunctive kaḥ at the end of b to the same root; however, they are
not used in the same idiom. It’s also worth noting that kṛṇuhí is followed by particles
that ordinarily take 2nd position in a clause (smā no), and so kṛṇuhí by default appears
to be in 1st position. And both 17a jahí and 18d kṛṇuhí are right after the caesura. But
none of these explanations seems sufficient &ndash; e.g., post-caesura position does not
induce accent on verbs &ndash; and I think we must consider these two exx. as peculiarities
of the composer of this tṛca.</p>
<h3 id="vi4417">VI.44.17</h3>
<p>The object phrase in the 1st hemistich provides an ex. of number
disharmony (of a different type from that in vs. 13). The main objects of Indra’s
24
smiting are “rivals (and) foes,” the pl. phrase śátrūn … amítrān, but they are further
specified as “kin and non-kin,” jāmím ájāmim, in the singular. The same disharmony
is found in IV.4.5 jāmím ájāmim … śátrūn, where the śátrūn that closes our pāda a
substitutes for amítrān.</p>
<h3 id="vi4418">VI.44.18</h3>
<p>For the idiom in sūrī́n kṛṇuhí … ardhám, cf. II.30.5 asmā́n ardhám krṇ̥ utāt.
VI.44.19–21: This tṛca has a more obvious unifying feature than the last several: the
repeated ‘bull’ words, vṛ́ṣan- and vṛṣabhá-. I count 16 exx. of the two stems in the
three vss. The bull(ish) grammatical subjects of the three vss. are different: 19
Indra’s horses, 20 the soma drinks, 21 Indra himself. The vṛ́ṣan- stem predominates;
vṛṣabhá- only appears beginning in the last pāda of 20 (though prepared for by instr.
pl. vṛ́ṣabhiḥ in 20c). I do not see any appreciable difference in their usage; note the
coreferential dative vṛ́ṣṇe … vṛṣabhā́ya in 20d and, even more striking, the use of the
two stems in strictly parallel expressions in 21a and b: vṛ́ṣā … divó vṛṣabháḥ
pṛthivyā́ḥ “the bull of heaven, the bull of earth” and vṛ́ṣā síndhūnāṃ vṛṣabhá
stíyānām “the bull of the rivers and the bull of the standing waters.” Nonetheless, Ge
carefully distinguishes them, with Bull reserved for vṛṣabhá- and vṛ́ṣan- rendered as
Riese / riesig ‘giant’. But I very much doubt if the intent was “you are the giant of
heaven, the bull of the earth,” etc.
The concentration on the bull words leaves little room or energy for other
poetic flourishes.</p>
<h3 id="vi4420">VI.44.20</h3>
<p>Although they belong to different, and distant, tṛcas, the partitive gen.
construction here, … prá … sutā́nām, DAT bharanti …, matches that in vs. 13: … prá
… sutā́nām, DAT bhara … and occupies the same position in the vs., though in our
vs. √bhṛ also has a direct acc. object sómam.</p>
<h3 id="vi4421">VI.44.21</h3>
<p>Given the parallelism of the phrase vṛ́ṣā síndhūnāṃ vṛṣabhá stíyānām, it is
clear that the gen. pl. stíyānām must be in semantic complementarity with síndhūnām
‘of the rivers’. Almost the same pair is found in VII.5.2, with a substitution for the
first nom.: netā́síndhūnāṃ vṛṣabhá stíyānām. Gr glosses stíyā- ‘Schneefeld,
Gletscher’, but, given the relative lack of attention to snow and the like in the RV
once the Indo-Aryans had left the high mountains mostly behind, some other type of
water contrasting with rivers seems more likely &ndash; with Ge’s “der stehenden
Gewässer” a likely alternative (cf. also Lüders, Varuṇa I.144). Re’s “eauxstagnantes” (EVP XIII.56 and 141), though expressing a similar contrast, is less
appealing because of the negative implication of “stagnant waters”: would Indra
really want to be their bull? The question then is what the form is derived from;
EWA classifies it with the root √styā ‘be stiff’, of limited attestation in Skt. but
found also in MIA, which seems reasonable. However, I am tempted to see a primary
or secondary association with √sthā ‘stand’, since forms of this root (with the sense
‘stand still’) can be used of waters. Cf., e.g., the famous phrase describiing the
rushing of the waters freed by Indra in the Vṛtra battle in I.32.10 átiṣṭḥantīnām “of
25
those (waters) not standing still.” Re (EVP XIII.141) in a lapidary comment &ndash; “fait
comme díya-” &ndash; seems to hint at a direct derivation (díya- to √dā, then stíya- to
√sthā) without pursuing it, and Lub (System, 104) tentatively suggests that it belongs
to an <em>-i-enlarged form of √</em>steh2, viz. *steh2-i-, but doesn’t further spell out the
details. The trick of course is to keep the laryngeal from aspirating the t; if we start
with Lub’s root, the zero-grade *sth2-i- would presumably metathesize to *stih2 (as
with √pā(y) ‘drink’: pītá-), which would yield stiy- before a vowel. But I have no
commitment to such an analysis. In any case it is impossible to tell whether the form
belongs to a short or a long a/ā stem, since it only shows up in the gen. pl.
VI.44.22–24: As noted in the publ. intro., repetition also characterizes this tṛca: the
ayám that opens every hemistich, along with two other pādas (23b, 24b). In all
instances the referent is Soma, whose name, however, does not appear until the
opening of the last pāda, 24d (though the reliable synonym índu- ‘drop’ is found in
22d). The beginning of the first vs., 22a, identifies the subject as a god (ayáṃ deváḥ),
and the tṛca attributes powerful agency to him, including deeds generally associated
with Indra, such as the defeat of the Paṇi (22b), the placing of light in the sun (23b),
and the propping apart of the two worlds (24a). It is only the specification of Indra
(in an oblique case) as the “yokemate” of “this god” early in the tṛca (22b índreṇa
yujā́) that prevents the audience from assuming that ayáṃ deváḥ refers to Indra (who
is, after all, the dedicand of the hymn). Nonetheless, the virtual identification of
Soma with Indra is clear.</p>
<h3 id="vi4422">VI.44.22</h3>
<p>As just noted, índuḥ ‘drop’ opening pāda b firmly identifies the subject as
Soma, but the common word play between phonologically similar índu- and índra-,
found esp. in Maṇḍala IX, underlines the permeable boundary just noted between
Indra and Soma in this tṛca.
The brief narrative allusion in pāda c (“stole the weapons of his own father”)
sounds like a fractured version of the just-born Indra stealing the soma from Tvaṣṭar,
but it is hard to know how to square that tale with this formulation.</p>
<h3 id="vi4423">VI.44.23</h3>
<p>As Ge points out (n. 23cd), in the 2nd hemistich Soma the god is
differentiated from soma the drink, with the god finding the distant, hidden drink.
tritéṣu is the only pl. form to this stem in the RV, and it is not at all clear what
it is doing here. Ge takes it as the PN Trita, with the pl. referring to Trita and his
brothers, among whom Soma (the god) finds soma (the drink). But I know of no such
narrative, and Ge does not cite one. I take the form instead as representing the older
adj. ‘third’ (see EWA s.v.), the older correspondent of tṛtī́ya- ‘third’ (which, of
course, is also old, having Iranian cognates). As is well known, there are three
heavens, and I take the “third realms of light” to be the third or highest heaven, here
in the pl. because it is conceived of as further subdivided. For soma as resident in the
third heaven, see K. Klaus, Die altindische Kosmologie, 175 with n. 66. It is possible
(but only possible) that the vs. implicitly depicts the three heavens, with the dawns in
the nearer one, the sun in the middle, and the soma in the third.
26
The drink is threefold presumably because of the three pressings of the soma
sacrifice.</p>
<h3 id="vi4424">VI.44.24</h3>
<p>(ví) ṣkabhāyat echoes astabhāyat in the first vs. of the tṛca (22b).
I will not speculate on the numerology in saptáraśmi- ‘having seven reins’
and daśayantra- ‘having ten fastenings’, whose referents may be ritual or
cosmological, or (most likely) both.</p>
<h2 id="vi45-indra">VI.45 Indra</h2>
<p>This hymn contains 5 instances of the phrase “the stake (that is) set,” hitádhána-: 3 acc. sg. hitáṃ dhánam (2c, 12c, 15c), 2 loc. sg. (11b, 13b). All but one of
these has the order just given, but one of the loc. exx. (13b) is found in the opposite
order, as dháne hité as opposed to 11b hité dháne, which matches the order of the
accusatives. A survey of the other examples of the phrase in the RV turns up one
more ex. of the acc. hitáṃ dhánam (VIII.80.8), but a number of further loc. exx.,
almost all of which have the flipped order found in 13b dháne hité (I.40.2=VI.61.5,
I.116.15, I.132.5, VIII.3.9, IX.53.2) versus hité dháne (X.63.14). There is only one
ex. of the phrase outside of the acc. sg. and loc. sg., namely dháneṣu hitéṣu
(VIII.16.5). It thus appears that the acc. and loc. exx. have different underlying
orders. Since the word order in this phrase, in both acc. and loc., is, at least to the
naked eye, metrically indifferent (always ⏑ – ⏑ –), it is hard to see what is driving the
variable order, esp. since almost all instantiations of this phrase are pāda-final
(except for I.116.15 and 132.5). Within this very limited data set, it would be
possible to assume that the variant order signals different syntactic intentions: “the
set stake” (acc.) as opposed to the loc. absol. “when the stake (is/was) set,” with
secondary predication. Dieter Gunkel (pers. comm.) tells me that he produced a
similar (independent) hypothesis when investigating “swappable bigrams” with
Kevin Ryan (some of which results were presented in Vienna, June 24, 2015).
However, given the vagaries of RVic word order, it is difficult to know if such a
hypothesis would hold up across a large set of data. It would be useful to investigate
word order in clear loc. absolutes.</p>
<h3 id="vi453">VI.45.3</h3>
<p>I have silently suppressed the plurals in práṇītayaḥ and ūtáyaḥ (guidance
and help, rather than guidances and helps). Given that práṇītayaḥ reprises ā́nayat …
súnītī in the 1st vs. of the tṛca, it might be better to translate it as “Great is his
leading.”
The three -ti-stem abstracts práṇīti-, práśasti-, and ūtí- recall súnīti- in 1b.</p>
<h3 id="vi454">VI.45.4</h3>
<p>As was implied in the publ. tr., there is more cohesion across tṛcas than
within them. In this 1st vs. of the 2nd tṛca there are a number of connections to the
previous one: the 1st word sákhāyaḥ recalls sákhā in 1c; in b the impv. prá … gāyata
“sing forth” is a variant of the nominal form práśasti- (3b) to the lexeme prá √śaṃs
‘proclaim forth’; in c the nominal clause sá hí naḥ X resembles 1c … sá naḥ X; c
27
contains another -ti-stem abstract, prámati-, like those in 3 (two of which are cmpded
with prá-); and the final word of the vs., mahī́, echoes the 1st word of 3 mahī́ḥ.</p>
<h3 id="vi455">VI.45.5</h3>
<p>The sequence ékasya … dváyoḥ … / utédṛśe yáthā vayám “of one, of two
and for such as we are” is a nice example of Behagel’s Law. It also shows variant
syntax in a conjoined construction, since the third conjoined member is dative
(ī́dṛśe), while the first two are gen. (unless dváyoḥ is loc., which seems unlikely). The
result, at least in translation, is almost awkward, but the formal switch in case (and
number) has semantic consequences, in my opinon. The sequence first presents itself
as a purely numerical one (cf. Klein DGRV I.332–33), and we might expect “of one,
of two, and *of however many we are.” But the sg. ī́dṛśe changes the focus from the
quantity of the beneficiaries to their quality (“such as we,” in implicit contrast to
people outside our circle of lesser value), and the dative emphasizes the benefactive
nature of Indra’s actions. Ge’s “auch für einen solchen, wie wir sind” misses the
point, in my view.</p>
<h3 id="vi456">VI.45.6</h3>
<p>I supply ‘us’ as obj. in both a and b, adapted from 4c and esp. 5c; Ge
supplies “Männer” (in b), presumably on the basis of nr̥bhiḥ in c. Either will work,
but ‘us’ seems to provide more continuity.
náyasi in a connects across tṛcas with ā́nayat in 1a, and ukthaśaṃsínaḥ in b
with práśastayaḥ in 3b. In 3b Indra is said to have many práśasti-, and here the
producers of these (prá)śasti- are identified (as us or, with Ge, men).</p>
<h3 id="vi457">VI.45.7</h3>
<p>More cross-tṛca connections: bráhma-vāhas- 7a/4a, sákhi- 7b/1c/4a.</p>
<h3 id="vi458">VI.45.8</h3>
<p>Ge takes ūcuḥ to √vac and supplies hitāni with ní: “In dessen Händen …
alle Güter, wie man sagt, nieder(gelegt sind),” but Old’s view, that ūcuḥ belongs to
√uc, which regularly takes the preverb ní in the meaning ‘be accustomed to, be at
home in’, is preferable. (And in fact Ge admits as much in n. 8a.)</p>
<h3 id="vi459">VI.45.9</h3>
<p>This vs. contains two parallel direct objects (“strongholds” and “tricks”) in
two parallel clauses, which presuppose the same verb. The preverb (ví) is given at the
beginning of pāda a, the verb (vṛhá) itself at the beginning of the 2nd hemistich; they
must be assembled to produce the full lexeme.
VI.45.10–11: These vss. form a syntactic pair characterized by simple enjambment.
Both vss. begin tám u tvā, with the iteration of this phrase in 11a still part of the main
clause of vs. 10 (and the object of 10c áhūmahi). The rest of the first hemistich of 11
consists of two rel. clauses, whose predicate (the predicate for both clauses), hávyaḥ,
is found at the beginning of c. The rest of c is a separate impv. clause. Although the
content of these two vss. is banal in the extreme, the syncopated effect produced by
having the syntactic units not conform to metrical units gives it a bit of oomph. The
vs. pair is unified by the ‘call’ motif: 10c áhūmahi ‘we have called upon’, 11c hávyaḥ
‘to be called upon’ / hávam ‘call’. The root √śru also provides unity: 10c
28
śravasyávaḥ ‘seeking fame’, 11c śrudhī ‘hear’, also, in 12b śravā́yyān ‘worthy of
fame’.</p>
<h3 id="vi4510">VI.45.10</h3>
<p>After the opening tám u tvā, the rest of the hemistich consists only of vocc.
satya somapā, índra vājānām pate, with only a single accent among them: índra is
accented because it’s initial in its pāda, while the gen. pl. vājānām is unaccented
because it’s part of a voc. phrase. Note that in the HvN ed. vājānā́m bears an
impossible, final-syllable accent, a typo that should be deleted.</p>
<h3 id="vi4511">VI.45.11</h3>
<p>It is worth noting that in the temporally contrastive rel. clauses (a: purā́
‘previously’, b: nūnám ‘now’) whose joint predicate is the grdv. hávyaḥ (see above),
the one with past reference has an overt copula, pf. ā́sitha, while the one with current
reference has the copula gapped.</p>
<h3 id="vi4512">VI.45.12</h3>
<p>The phrase hitá- dhána- is repeated from 11b and also picks up the same
phrase in 2c. (See disc. above.) In fact 12c tváyā jeṣma hitáṃ dhánam is a telling
variant on 2c índro jétā hitáṃ dhánam. In vs. 2 Indra is described as a/the (habitual)
winner of the stake, while by vs. 12 it is we who hope to be the winners with his
help. The vocalism of the precative jeṣma matches that of the agent noun jétā in 2.
See further 15c. Note also that 2b contains an instr. árvatā “with a steed” (in that
case an unsatisfactory one) like árvadbhiḥ in 12a.
The opening of the vs. is called “stark elliptisch” by Ge, who sees two
different possible constructions (n. 12a): “with insights (might we overcome) (the
insights of other poets) and with steeds (might we overcome) steeds” or “with
insights (as) steeds …” His tr. seems to reflect the first (though without supplying
any further material), while I prefer the second.</p>
<h3 id="vi4513">VI.45.13</h3>
<p>The new tṛca opens with yet another example of the ‘stake’ phrase, this
time in opposite order (dháne hité). For further on the order in this phrase, see the
above intro. comm. to the hymn.</p>
<h3 id="vi4514">VI.45.14</h3>
<p>The subjunctive ásati was omitted in tr.: the first line should read “Your
help that will have …”</p>
<h3 id="vi4515">VI.45.15</h3>
<p>The VP √ji hitáṃ dhánam returns from 2c and 12c, with two instances of
√ji: jéṣi jiṣṇo hitáṃ dhánam. Here the subject is Indra as in 2c, not ‘we’ (12c), but he
is making use of our (asmā́kena) chariot.</p>
<h3 id="vi4516">VI.45.16</h3>
<p>As Old notes (though not in those terms), we seem to have an embedded
main clause here &ndash; in that tám u stuhi forming the second part of pāda a interrupts
the rel. cl. that begins the vs. (yá éka íd) and continues through the rest of b and c,
with the accented verb jajñé in c. Since yá éka íd is in fact only a single constituent, it
might be best to consider it fronted around the brief main cl.
29</p>
<h3 id="vi4518">VI.45.18</h3>
<p>The precative perfect sāsahīṣṭhāḥ is striking.
VI.45.19–20: These two vss. contain superlatives to bahuvrīhi s-stems that appear
earlier in the simplex: 19c bráhma-vāhastamam: 4a bráhma-vāhase; 20c gírvanastamaḥ: 13a girvanaḥ (also 28b).</p>
<h3 id="vi4521">VI.45.21</h3>
<p>Ge takes niyúdbhiḥ and vā́jebhiḥ as parallel, and therefore the ‘teams’ are
among the things with which Indra fulfills our desire. Given the position of
niyúdbhiḥ in the 1st pāda and its usual usage, I think it rather refers to Indra’s teams,
with which he travels ‘here’, and I take ā́both with pṛṇa and with a verb of motion to
be supplied. For a similar use, see VI.22.11 sá no niyúdbhiḥ … ā́gahi …, also
addressed to Indra in this cycle.
VI.45.22–24: This tṛca concerns itself with cows, picking up gómadbhir gopate from
the end of the preceding tṛca (21c). In particular 23b vā́jasya gómataḥ “prize of
cows” reprises 21bc vā́jebhiḥ … gómadbhiḥ and is then echoed by vrajáṃ gómantam
“enclosure of cows” in 24ab.</p>
<h3 id="vi4522">VI.45.22</h3>
<p>The first pāda contains the common locution in which a poet addresses
himself in the sg., but makes a nod to his ritual colleagues in the 2nd pl.: tád vo gāya.
Lit. this should be “Sing (o poet=me) this, (on behalf of) you all (=priests).” See my
“Poetic Self-Reference in the Rig Veda and the Persona of Zarathustra” (Fs.
Skjaervø, BAI 19 [2005]), where this passage is disc. p. 69. The effort to introduce
the 2nd pl. into the English would overbalance the tr., in a way that the slender
enclitic vaḥ does not.
The simile in c is somewhat unsettling: “Sing what is weal for the able one as
if for a cow.” Presumably it’s not the song that would be weal for a/the cow. Sāy.’s
explan., reported by Ge (n. 22c), may well be correct: “as (fodder is) for a cow.”
Recall also 7c gā́ṃ ná dóhase huve “I call upon (Indra) like a cow for milking,”
where the cow simile is filled out. In light of this passage it may be that here what is
weal for the cow is not fodder but rather the call to be milked, which would better
resemble the song that is weal for Indra: “Sing what is weal for the able one, as (a
milking call) is for a cow.”</p>
<h3 id="vi4524">VI.45.24</h3>
<p>There is some difference of opinion on the source of the apparent
indefinite kuvítsa-, a hapax. Ge (n. 24a) asserts that sasya is the gen. corresponding
to sásmin, enclitic after kuvíd (presumably presupposing a notional word space kuvít
sasya). But the standard opinion, already registered by Gr (&lt; BR; see also explicitly
AiG II.1.327, repeated AiG II.2.924), is that it is derived from the univerbation of a
syntactic sequence kuvít sá (roughly “is it indeed this one?”), which is then
secondarily inflected. This seems the more likely explanation, and in fact there is
such a sequence attested in IV.51.4 kuvít sá. This passage contains a deliberative
either/or question “should it be the old course or a new one …?” kuvít sá … sanáyo
návo vā yā́maḥ, a context that favors development into an indefinite of the type
30
“someone or other.” In fact, our passage might be more clearly rendered as “to the
cattle enclosure of someone or other.”
VI.45.25–27: There is no obvious unifying feature in this tṛca, though Indra is
compared to a cow in the first two vss.</p>
<h3 id="vi4525">VI.45.25</h3>
<p>On the intensive pf. nonuvuḥ see Schaeffer (45) and Kü (283).</p>
<h3 id="vi4527">VI.45.27</h3>
<p>This vs. is identical to III.41.6, q.v. The lack of accent on mandasvā
despite the following hí is puzzling.
VI.45.28–30: Again no unity in the tṛca.</p>
<h3 id="vi4528">VI.45.28</h3>
<p>Although, as just noted, there’s no unity in the tṛca, there is some
continuity between tṛcas. Like the first vs. of the previous tṛca (25), this one has
polarized nom. #imā́ḥ … gíraḥ# “these songs” framing the first hemistich, which
responds to the acc. gíraḥ in the middle of the tṛca before that (23c). Moreover, the
simile “like cows their calf” (28c) reprises “like mothers their calf” in 25c.</p>
<h3 id="vi4529">VI.45.29</h3>
<p>This vs. is syntactically dependent on 28, with the acc. purūtámam picking
up tvā in 28a.
The cognate expression vā́jebhir vājayatā́m “competing for the prize with
their prizes” is a bit puzzling. I interpr. it as being a slight play on words, with the
instr. vā́jebhiḥ referring to the singers’ songs, expressing the means by which they
compete, while the prizes they compete for are material goods and fame. This
interpr. is somewhat supported by the next vs., where we hope that our praise-song is
the most successful one.</p>
<h3 id="vi4530">VI.45.30</h3>
<p>Notice the very un-Ārya phonology of the name of the patron, Bṛbu with
two plain b’s. (On Bṛbu as patron see Kuiper, Aryans, p. 6.) It is probably not an
accident that this vs. contains only one of two reff. to the Gaṅgā in the RV (the other
a voc. gaṅge in X.75.5), since the Gaṅgā is at the limits of the RVic geographical
horizon.
The simile is more lit. “(he is) broad like the Gangetic girth.”</p>
<h3 id="vi4531">VI.45.31</h3>
<p>Pādas ab are identical to VIII.94.3. For my interpr. of the hemistich and
esp. of the phrase aryá ā́see comm. there. Given the un-Ārya phonology of Bṛbu’s
name, there may be a particular pleasure in hymning the un-Ārya patron Bṛbu away
from the aríVI.46 Indra
This hymn nicely demonstrates the distribution of impv. forms to √bhū that I
discussed in my 1997 “Syntactic constraints on morphological change: The Vedic
31
imperatives bodhi, dehi, and dhehi”: bháva/bhava is found initial (3d) or final (10d,
11a) in its pāda or clause, while bodhi is internal (4c).
VI.46.1–2: Although the presence of hí, with its generally causal value, is often a
puzzle when it appears in the first pāda of a hymn, this one helps signal the
conceptual unity of this opening tṛca, with vs. 1 providing the various circumstances
under which we call upon Indra and vs. 2 containing the contents of our latest
address to the god &ndash; a call for additional generosity from him.
The poet plays with the 2nd sg. pronoun. Historically &ndash; and usually
synchronically in the RV &ndash; the nom. sg. tvám is disyllabic (t
u
vám) and the acc. sg.
tvā́m is monosyllabic, with occasional distraction to two syllables in analogy to the
nom. But here the 1st vs. has three distracted acc. sg. t
u
vā́m, prominently pāda-initial
(a, c, d), while the nom. sg. at the beginning of the 2nd vs. is monosyllabic. To match
disyllabic t
u
vā́m, in 2a the two syllables are filled out by the addition of the pleonastic
sá (#sá tvám), which is syntactically at home as subject marker of the 2nd sg. impv.
kira (see my 1992 “Vedic ‘sá figé’: An inherited sentence connective?”). Since sá in
such contexts is unnecessary, its presence draws attention to the metrical interchange
between the nom. and acc. of the pronoun here.</p>
<h3 id="vi462">VI.46.2</h3>
<p>Ge takes rathyàm as an adj. modifying áśvam (Wagenross); Gr does as well,
assigning the form to the vṛkī-inflected stem rathī́- (so also Lub). Neither of these
interpr. is impossible; however, I prefer to take rathyàm as belonging to the marginal
them. stem rathyà- (beside better attested ráthya-) and also to take it as a third term
in the gifts we want from Indra. There is nothing riding on the choice of interpr.,
however.</p>
<h3 id="vi463">VI.46.3</h3>
<p>This vs. shows some continuities with the previous pragātha: the root noun
cmpd satrāhā́(3a) echoes satrā́in 2d, as satpate (3c) does sátpatim in 1c. There is
also the variant 1st pl. mid. root form to √hū/hvā, hūmahe (3b), which contrasts with
hávāmahe in 1a. I can see no difference in sense here, and I think there are several
other factors at work. On the one hand, extremely common hávāmahe (+/- accent) is
almost never pāda-internal, whereas the rare-ish hūmáhe (+/- accent) appears about
half the time in that position (but see pāda-final hūmahe in 6b) &ndash; so it partly
replicates the bháva/bodhi distribution discussed above. But perhaps more important
is that the poet seems to be playing with metrical variants in a way similar to sá tvám
discussed above. Pāda b reads índraṃ táṃ hūmahe vayám. There is no good reason
for tám because índram more than sufficiently provides the acc. obj.; moreover, all
things being equal, tám (and its paradigmatic fellows) generally opens its pāda/clause
and in particular does not follow a coreferential noun. The common 1st pl. havāmahe,
already found in 1a, would easily fit in a version of this pāda that lacked the tám:
*índraṃ havāmahe vayám. I suggest that the poet called attention to his manipulation
of the variant verb forms by inserting a pleonastic tám, like the pleonastic sá in 2a,
and inserting it in the “wrong” place, which would draw the attention of his audience
even more.
32</p>
<h3 id="vi464">VI.46.4</h3>
<p>vṛṣabhéva is somewhat problematic: the Pp. analyzes it as vṛṣabhā́iva,
which is phonologically impeccable, but what form would vṛṣabhā́represent? Old’s
solution (flg. Lanman, Noun Inflection 329) that it is an underlying nom. sg. is surely
the most likely, whether we subscribe to Lanman’s “crasis after elision [of the s],”
i.e., vṛṣabhás iva à vṛṣabha iva à -e-. The publ. tr., as well as Ge., implicitly
follows this route. A long-shot possibility is that the Pp. vṛṣabhā́is the underlying
form, and it’s an old instr. sg. modifying or doubling manyúnā: “with bullish battlefury” or “with battle-fury as a bull.” But vṛ́ṣan- is the ‘bull’ stem generally used
(quasi-)adjectivally, not vṛṣabhá-. It might also be possible to see it as a voc.
vṛṣabha: this would easily account for the sandhi, but we would have to assume it got
secondarily accented after it was no longer understood as a voc., and this would also
introduce the interpretational problem of a voc. in a simile (though unfortunately
there are a few such).
On the problematic ṛcīṣama see the despairing comm. ad I.61.1.
The three loc. in d specify the ‘stakes’ (dhaná-) referred to by mahādhané.</p>
<h3 id="vi465">VI.46.5</h3>
<p>The voc. phrase in c, citra vajrahasta, is repeated from 2a.
The verb prā́ḥ must be read disyllabically. It could therefore technically be a
subjunctive (so apparently Gr), and in fact the light first syllable required could
reflect the loss of root-final laryngeal before the subjunctive suffixal vowel.
Hoffmann insistently calls it an injunc. (215 n. 201, 221), fld. by Lub, and the publ.
tr. (“you … fill”) reflects an injunctive interpr. But since this is not a cosmogonic act
&ndash; Indra is filling the world halves with “fame” &ndash; a subjunctive interpr. is possible,
esp. following the impv.: “bring us fame with which you will fill both these worldhalves.” I consider this a possible, perhaps even desirable alternative.</p>
<h3 id="vi466">VI.46.6</h3>
<p>The distracted acc. t
u
vā́m from 1a, c, d returns here, again as object of “we
call,” but with hūmahe rather than the hávāmahe of vs. 1.
On pibdaná- see also comm. ad IX.15.6. The stem is obviously derived from a
redupl. form of √pad; cf. the hapax med. part. píbdamāna- (X.101.11). The orig.
sense is likely ‘keep stepping, go step-by-step,’ vel sim., as an iter. See EWA s.v.
PAD, with ref. to Strunk and Gotō. A literal gloss could then be ‘plod, trudge’. This
literal sense is seen, in my view, in the participle in X.101.11 váhnir āpíbdamānaḥ
‘plodding draught horse’, and in IX.15.6 I also take vásūni pibdanā́as a somewhat
comic reference to cows as “plodding goods.” Our passage here is more difficult, as
the word is contrasted with vithurá- ‘wavering’; this opposition accounts for the
standard glosses as (Gr) ‘feststehend, fest’, (AiG II.2.595 ‘fest’ (but .203
‘erstarkend’), (Ge) ‘dauerhaft’, (Re) ‘solides’ (both latter in IX.15.6), but my
‘gain(ing) a foothold’ seems to preserve the root etymology and sense, while fitting
the context.

though different syntax.
VI.46.9–10: The unity of this pragātha is required by the fact that the rel. cl. of 10ab
must depend on the imperatival cl. of 9d, with initial yé (10a) picking up the last
word of 9, ebhyaḥ ‘from those’.</p>

VI.46.11–12: This pragātha shows both internal and external connections. As in the
previous pragātha the 2nd vs. is syntactically dependent on the first, with the yátra
clause of 12ab parallel to the yád clause of 11cd and both subordinate to the
imperatival clause of 11b. In addition the first and last hemistichs (11ab, 12cd) open
identically, with ádha smā, which echoes ádha smā of the last hemistich of the
previous pragātha (10cd).
On the particular connection of vs. 12 with vs. 9 see immed. below.</p>
<h3 id="vi4611">VI.46.11</h3>
<p>The first pāda is a bare variant of 3d: both contain the complex verbal
construction vṛdhé √bhū ‘be for strengthening / be there to strengthen’, each with the
complement enclitic naḥ. The only difference is the placement of the impv.: initial
bhávā in 3d, final bhava in 11a, differing only in accent and, possibly, in the length of the
final vowel: the Pp. resolves the cross-pāda sandhi bhavéndra with short bhava, like 10d,
but a long vowel would be equally possible.</p>
<h3 id="vi4612">VI.46.12</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. contains a grammatical error. It takes priyā́as modifying fem.
pl. tanvàḥ, but the sandhi context of priyā́makes this impossible: it would have to be
*priyā́ḥ. It must modify śárma (as Ge takes it, also Gr), which must then be a neut.
plural to the -an-stem. This tr. should be corrected to “… stretch wide their own
bodies as dear shelters …”
Ge takes tanvàḥ and śárma as implicitly conjoined (“Wo die Tapferen ihre
Leiber breit machen (and) die lieben Schilde des Vaters”), but I think it more likely
that the champions are stretching their bodes to serve as shelters/shields. Under this
interpr. the plural of śárma makes sense: multiple bodies multiple shields.
Pādas abc strongly echo 9abc, with the c pādas esp. close, both containing the
VP chardír yacha (in opposite order and non-contiguous in 12c) + conjoined DAT.
beneficiary (9c maghávadbhyaś ca máhyaṃ ca; 12c tanvè táne ca). However, the first
hemistich of 12 varies tellingly from 9ab: in 9 it is Indra who holds out the shelter
34
(śaraṇám), which is equated with the chardíḥ of c, but in 12 it is the mortal
champions (śū́rāsaḥ) who offer their own bodies as shelter (śárma). (Although the
two words for ‘shelter’ are different, they are transparently related and share the
same descriptors elsewhere.) The bodies of the mortal warriors are theirs to deploy,
but also under the protection of Indra, as shown not only by tanvè in the next pāda as
recipient of Indra’s protection, but also by tanūpā́ḥ ‘protector of bodies’ in 10d,
applied to Indra.
The last pādas of vss. 9 and 12 provide the final thread of connection between
the two vss., since both contain the impv. yāváyā̆ ‘keep away’. In 12d the accent on
the verb is anomalous, but I have no trouble assuming that it was adapted from 9d,
where the initial position of the verb requires it.
VI.46.13–14: As was noted in the publ. intro., this last pragātha stands somewhat
apart from the rest of the hymn, though it does show connections with the beginning
of the hymn. The near repetition found between the last two pragāthas (9–10 / 11–12;
see disc. above) gave the sense that the hymn was coming to an end. As often, RVic
poets seem to enjoy shaking up our structural expectations. The lack of a main clause
in the whole of this two-vs. complex is especially striking and ends the hymn on an
unsettled and somewhat frenzied note.</p>
<h3 id="vi4613">VI.46.13</h3>
<p>The form árvataḥ ends the first pāda of this vs. and the last of vs. 1, but
with different grammatical identities: gen. sg. in 1d, acc. pl. here. This difference
may be one indication that this pragātha both responds to the rest of the hymn and
distances itself from it.
mahādhané is repeated from 4c.</p>
<h3 id="vi4614">VI.46.14</h3>
<p>While vs. 13 has a relatively perspicuous structure &ndash; a single transitive yád
clause whose final pāda is a simile matching the acc. direct object &ndash; vs. 14 is a
structural mess. Its first pāda is another simile in the acc. matching the direct object
of vs. 13; it is followed by a yádi (or *yád ī; see below) clause (b), which may or may
not contain a verb, followed by a rel. cl. (cd) introduced by yé, containing another
simile referring to the same direct object but now in the nom. By now the original
referent is quite distant, and it is not entirely clear which parts belong to the simile,
which to the frame.
Pāda b is esp. problematic, mostly because of the ambiguity of the phrase ánu
ṣváṇi, in which sváni has been identified variously as a noun or as a verb. The
preponderance of opinion favors the former: Whitney (§390b, though see Roots,
where he lists it, with ?, as an aor.), Gr (though he allows for the other poss.), Ge,
Lub. On the other hand, Old, flg. BR, considers it a verb form, a passive aorist.
Wackernagel (AiG III.23) is uncertain. The noun-faction is further divided by what
stem they assign it to: neut. -i-stem (Gr, Lub), root noun in -an- (Wh, and
presumably Ge, since he tr. it as a loc. “im Getöse”). If it is a noun (‘sound’, vel
sim.), a verb needs to be supplied with ánu, but this of course would pose no
problem. I am always reluctant to oppose Old, and in this particular case there is
35
strong objective evidence that he is correct, namely the close sandhi effect that
retroflexes ṣ after ánu. A collection of all s-forms after ánu produces remarkably
clear-cut results: ánu only retroflexes following verb forms, never nominal forms.
Although it may seem overkill to list all the examples, the collection may be useful
for other purposes:
ánu + VERB: I.167.10 [=182.8, III.39.8] ánu ṣyāt, I.185.4 ánu ṣyāma, V.73.4 ánu
ṣṭáve, VIII.3.8 ánu ṣṭuvanti. There is only one verbal form without retroflexion:
IV.4.2 ánu sprś̥ a.
ánu + NOMINAL (etc.): I.33.11 [=I.88.6, 176.2, III.51.11, IV.33.6, 52.6, VII.56.13,
VIII.88.5] ánu svadhā́m, I.80.1 (etc.) ánu svarā́jyam, I.121.3 ánu svajā́m, I.134.1 ánu
sūnṛ́tā, I.191.15 ánu saṃvátaḥ, III.7.6 [=V.59.1, IX.63.6] ánu svám, III.33.3 ánu
saṃcárantī, III.35.8 ánu svā́ḥ, IV.40.4 ánu saṃtávītvat, IV.45.6 ánu svadháyā,
V.32.10 ánu svadhā́vne, V.34.1 ánu svadhāmitā, VI.25.8 ánu sáho, VII.7.2 [X.14.2]
ánu svā́ḥ, VII.31.7 ánu svadhā́varī, VIII.4.8 ánu spighyàm, VIII.6.38 ánu suvānā́sa,
IX.103.5 ánu svadhā́ḥ, X.17.11 ánu saṃcárantam, X.17.11 ánu saptá, X.56.3 ánu
satyā́, X.103.6 ánu sám.
Among the nominals it is striking how many begin with sv- as in our case.
I can see only one possible conclusion, that Old must be right, this is a 3rd sg.
passive (or rather, intransitive) aor., and we need to supply a subject. Old suggests
chariot, which seems reasonable. As he points out, the RV has a bahuvrīhi svanádratha- lit. ‘having a sounding chariot’ (though prob. used as a PN), and a chariot
sounding “following the roar (of the horses)” makes sense. II.4.6 vā́r ṇá pathā́
ráthyeva svānīt “like water along a path, like chariot (wheels) he has sounded”
provides a parallel not only for the sounding chariot, but also for the rushing,
sounding rivers in the simile of pāda a.
A few other loose ends in pāda b: I interpr. yádi as *yád ī “when it,” with
shortening of ī before the cluster kl. A condition ‘if’ doesn’t make sense. As for that
cluster, klóśa- is the only -l-form to √kruś ‘cry out’. Is this racetrack slang?
Pāda c compares the steeds circling the race course to birds (of prey) circling
over the raw flesh of a dead animal (a striking image). Ge considers the loc. gávi to
be the correspondent of ā́miṣi in the simile: the cow is the prize over which the
horses circle (“die wie die Vögel um das Aas, so um die Kuh(herde) kreisen”). The
publ. tr. by contrast takes gávi as a piece of horse tack, the reins or something else
made of leather, and construes it with gṛbhītā́ḥ. I now favor Ge’s interpr., which is
more striking and which also conforms to the loc. of the stake found several times in
this hymn. I would amend the tr. to “who, like birds over raw flesh, keep circling (the
race course) over the bovine (prize), being held firm in your two arms …”</p>
<h2 id="vi47-indra">VI.47 Indra</h2>
<p>36
VI.47.1–5: As indicated in the publ. intro., the first 5 vss. of the hymn constitute a
praise of soma, shading, towards the end, into simultaneous praise of Indra. It is
formally unified: beginning with vs. 2, all but one (2cd) of the hemistichs begins with
ayám, and vs. 1 contains four exx. of ayám as well (2 each in the 1st 2 pādas), though
oddly positioned.</p>
<h3 id="vi471">VI.47.1</h3>
<p>Although this vs. is quite straightforward in general, it has some
peculiarities. To begin with, the four nominal clauses with ayám in the first hemistich
are all in the unusual order X ayám, which is reversed (/repaired) in the four
subsequent vss. See esp. the opening of 1a svādúṣ kílāyám corrected to the more
standard 2a ayáṃ svādúḥ. I have no idea what motivated the X ayám order.
It is not clear to me whether the four clauses name four different
types/preparations of soma or all four refer to a single soma (or, in some way, both:
all soma drinks, no matter how prepared, are in essence one).
Note also the particle kíla, which is rare in the RV, esp. outside of X: only 5
of the 12 occurrences are not in X, and 2 of them are in this vs.
I am also puzzled by the accent on asyá in c. Since the soma is amply referred
to earlier in the vs., we would expect unaccented asya (cf., e.g., papivām̐índro asya
V.29.3, 30.11). I have no explanation, and it seems not to have bothered any other
commentator.</p>
<h3 id="vi472">VI.47.2</h3>
<p>This vs. chains rel. clauses, with the gen. rel. yásya in b referring to the
soma in a, while nom. yáḥ in cd refers to Indra, who first appears in the rel. cl. of b.
It is difficult (though perhaps not impossible) to construe ví … hán ‘smash
apart’ with the acc. cyautnā́‘exploits’ in c as well as the more likely object dehyàḥ
‘walls’ in d. It is therefore best to follow Ge (also Hoffmann, Injunk. 168) and supply
a form of √kṛ or the like in c.
VI.47.3–5: As noted in the publ. intro. as well as above, the praise of soma modulates
towards praise of Indra in this sequence, starting in the 2nd half of vs. 3. The first half
of 3 clearly identifies soma as referent with the ppl. pītáḥ ‘when drunk’, but the
cosmogonic deeds of 3d and of at least the first half of 4 begin to sound Indraic. We
are brought abruptly back to soma in 4d (sómo dādhāra), but this almost seems like a
trick or a feint to keep us from drifting further. And vs. 5 again sounds Indraic, esp.
the final vṛṣabhó marútvān “the bull accompanied by the Maruts”: marútvant- is
overwhelmingly an epithet of Indra. For a similar nearby sequence of vss. that
oscillates between soma and Indra (and also uses ayám as an organizing word) see
VI.44.22–24 and comm. ad loc.</p>
<h3 id="vi473">VI.47.3</h3>
<p>It is not clear what noun to supply with fem. pl. urvī́ḥ, though something
like ‘worlds (so Ge), realms’ makes sense. The same ṣáḍ urvī́ḥ is found in X.14.16 in
unclear context, and as a voc. in X.128.5 dévīḥ ṣaḍ urvīḥ &lsquo;you six broad goddesses’,
again with uncertain referent. Elsewhere urvī́ḥ applies to waters or rivers, but liquid
doesn’t seem appropriate here. Perhaps in our vs. it’s evoking a pl. of pṛthivī́ ‘earth’,
37
with a pun on a different word for ‘broad’, urú-, urvī́-. Note that pṛthivī́- occurs in
the next vs., dependent on varimán- ‘expanse’, which is derivationally related to
urú-.</p>
<h3 id="vi474">VI.47.4</h3>
<p>The first hemistich has a repetitive structure inside a chiastic frame. The
opening ayáṃ sá yáḥ is balanced by ayáṃ sáḥ at the end of b; we might perhaps
expect *yó ayáṃ sáḥ in fact. The single verb ákṛṇot, inside this frame, does for both
objects, which are responsive: morphologically identical and near-rhyming acc.
varimā́ṇam … varṣmā́ṇam, each with a dependent gen. belonging to a matched
semantic pair, pṛthivyā́ḥ … diváḥ.
Pāda c is problematic. It lacks a verb, so it is impossible to know for sure
what relations are envisioned among the ill-assorted lexical items; the real-world
referents of pīyū́ṣam ‘beestings’ and tisṛ́ṣu pravátsu “on/in the three slopes” are
uncertain; it is not even clear whether it should be grouped with ab or with d. Ge
groups it loosely with d, renders pīyū́ṣam as “Seim” and tisṛ́ṣu pravátsu as “in die
drei Strömen,” and supplies “hat … geschaffen” as the verb. I am not sure what he’s
trying to convey, and pravát- does not straightforwardly mean ‘stream’, but ‘slope’
or ‘plunge’. The publ. tr. takes c with ab, supplying ákṛṇot from there, but I am now
doubtful about this, in part on the basis of IX.109.6 divó dhartā́si śukráḥ pīyū́ṣah
“You, the gleaming beestings, are the supporter of heaven,” where soma is identified
as pīyū́ṣa- and identified as an upholder (dhartár-), reminiscent of our d sómo
dādhāra. As for tisṛ́ṣu pravátsu, I wonder if this is shorthand for “pravát- plus two”
as expressed in VII.50.4 praváto niváta udvátaḥ “(from) the slope, the depth, and the
height”—possibly referring to the three worlds, which all appear in this verse:
heaven and earth in ab, the midspace in d. Perhaps the idea is that Soma placed or
supports the distillation of himself, his liquid essence, in all three worlds. If this is so,
a form of √dhṛ borrowed from d would work better than √kṛ from ab.
I also now realize that the preterital tr. of dādhāra in d, matching that of Ge
(“hat … befestigt”), is wrong, since, as Kü points out, the pf. of √dhṛ is always
presential.
Putting this all together, I would alter the tr. of cd to “this one (upholds) his
‘beestings’ in the three “slopes” (=worlds); Soma upholds the broad midspace,” with
absolutely no certainty about the rendering of c.</p>
<h3 id="vi475">VI.47.5</h3>
<p>HvN divide the 2nd hemistich as … skámbhanenód # di
yā́m, with úd the final
of pāda a and di
yā́m distracted and pāda-initial. But this is clearly wrong: úd is a
preverb in tmesis with astabhnāt and should open the pāda, and dyā́m is rarely if ever
distracted. Lub’s division is correct.
As noted above, the 2nd hemistich of this vs. sounds esp. Indraic.</p>
<h3 id="vi476">VI.47.6</h3>
<p>rayi-sthā́na- is a bahuvrīhi, lit. ‘having your place/standing in wealth’ vel
sim., though the publ. tr. is less awk.
38</p>
<h3 id="vi477">VI.47.7</h3>
<p>The vs. is built on variant repetition: ab prá ṇah …, prá naḥ … prataram / c
su-pāró ati-pārayó / d sú-nītiḥ … vāmá-nītiḥ.
I have no idea why in the identical sequence prá + naḥ, the first has
retroflexed ṇ and the latter does not. Both prá-s are preverbs in tmesis with 2nd sg.
impvs. (paśya and naya). The only differences are 1) the first prá sequence is not
initial (being preceded by voc. índra), 2) in the second sequence the impv.
immediately follows naḥ, while in the first some verbal material intervenes, and 3) in
the first naḥ functions as a dat. but in the second as an acc. None of these differences
should (as far as I can see) trigger different sandhi effects.</p>
<h3 id="vi479">VI.47.9</h3>
<p>The vs. contains three phonologically similar splvs., stationed at pāda edge:
#váriṣṭhe &hellip; #váhiṣṭhayoḥ &hellip; / &hellip; várṣiṣṭhām#. This is somewhat reminiscent of the
phonological/morphological figure in 4ab varimā́ṇam … varṣmā́ṇam, esp. since
váriṣṭhe and várṣiṣṭhām belong to the same roots as the two forms in 4.
In b the HvN text should read śatāvann. This voc. is variously interpr. (see
Old for some reff.), but I follow Ge, and implicitly the Pp., in taking it as (metrically)
lengthened *śata-van, to a -van-stem, contra Gr’s śata-ava(n)t-, with the pres. part.
of √av ‘help’. This śatā-van- would be a byform of better attested śatá-vant-. It
needs to belong to a -van- rather than a -vant- stem because otherwise the expected
voc. would be -vas. But we find -vant- and -van- stems side-by-side, notably in
maghávan(t)-. Debrunner (AiG II.2, most clearly p. 904, citing this passage) argues
that -vant-stems are “sachlich” while -van-stems are “persönlich,” which would work
for śatávant- versus our śatāvan-, but not, obviously, for maghávan(t)-.
The tr. of d is disputed. Ge takes rā́yaḥ as nom. pl. (as it generally is) and the
subj. of the sg. verb tārīt: “nicht sollen die Reichtümer eines hohen Herren die
unseren überbieten.” This requires that the sg. verb take a masc. pl. subj. While the
neut. pl. + sg. verb construction is fairly rare, but attested and inherited, I do not
know of masculine pl. equivalents. Old (ZDMG 54: 170) thinks the incongruity of
number is the result of the adjustment to the formulaic nature of rā́yo aryáḥ, tr.
“mögen uns nicht die Kargen den Reichtum überwinden,” with aryáḥ nom. pl. of arí-
&ndash; in other words a different masc. pl. subj. with sg. verb. Thieme (Fremdling, 56–57)
makes appropriately short work of both of these proposals, but I find his own
solution puzzling: “Möge nicht überholen unsere Reichtümer [der] des Fremdlings.”
Since he adamantly rejects the masc. pl. + sg. verb interpr., all I can figure is that
he’s generating a singular *rayíḥ to serve as subject (represented by his bracketed
[der]), but there is no support for this and it seems an artifice of convenience. No
doubt mine does, too: like Thieme I take rā́yaḥ as acc. pl., as it sometimes is (though
rāyáḥ would be expected), and for sg. subj. I supply íṣ- ‘refreshment’ from the
previous pāda. I also interpr. the verb tārīt not as hostile ‘overcome’ but as a plain
verb of motion ‘cross over to’; cf. usages like átāriṣma támasaḥ pā́ram asyá “we
have crossed over to the far shore of this darkness” (I.92.6 = I.183-84.6, VII.73.1).
The point is that the refreshment we’ve begged Indra for should not fall into enemy
hands.
39
As discussed esp. ad IV.48.1 and VI.14.3, 20.1, I take the phrase rā́yo aryáḥ
“riches of the stranger” as referring to manpower.</p>

VI.47.11–13: The first pāda of 12 recasts that of 11: with sutrā́mā matching trātā́ram
and s
u
vávām̐ávobhiḥ matching avitā́ram; 13a then repeats sutrā́mā su
vávān. The
connections between 12–13 and neighboring vss. in this hymn make it less likely (at
least to me) that they are direct evidence of the Sautrāmaṇī ritual here, instead of
being pressed into service of that ritual later. See publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="vi4712">VI.47.12</h3>
<p>In addition to the repetition just described, 12b sumṛḷīkó bhavatu is a
variant of 10a mṛḷá, and ábhayaṃ kṛṇotu reminds us of 8ab ánu neṣi … ábhayam.</p>
<h3 id="vi4714">VI.47.14</h3>
<p>The long vowel of urū́is puzzling. Since it appears in the simile urū́ná
rā́dhaḥ, it should be neut. sg. urú, and acdg. to Gr and AiG III.145 (with reff.) it is,
with metrical lengthening. By contrast, Lub identifies it as a nom. pl. Since the frame
corresponding to this simile is neut. pl. sávanāni purū́ni, I also prefer neut. pl.; it may
show attraction to the number of the frame: “the many pressings are broad like your
bounty.”
As Ge (n. 14d) cleverly points out, the waters, cows, and drops are the three
ingredients of soma.
VI.47.15–18: As noted in the publ. intro., this section, which concerns Indra’s fickle
attentions to various clients in turn, is marked grammatically by āmreḍitas and
intensives (i.e., iterative/frequentatives), expressing the constantly shifting nature of
the actions and their objects. See the publ. intro. for the continuity of content I see in
this section.</p>
<h3 id="vi4715">VI.47.15</h3>
<p>Ge renders d exactly opposite to the publ. tr.: “so macht er den Vorderen
zum Hintermann” (fld. by Klein, “āmreḍitas”: “he makes the one at the fore into one
who lags behind”). But the simile in c is about walking one step at a time (“putting
his two feet down one after the other”), and unless Indra is walking backwards my
interpr. must be correct. It’s true that pū́rvam ‘in front’ precedes áparam ‘behind’ in
the text, but word order is scarcely a reliable guide in the RV, esp. since in nominal
sentences we often get PREDICATE SUBJECT order. (Furthermore, there&rsquo;s a sort of
iconic ordering of the two adjectives, with pū́rva- first, which can be independent of
the larger sense.)</p>
<h3 id="vi4716">VI.47.16</h3>
<p>In d víśaḥ … manuṣyā̀n do not match in gender. Old suggests that the latter
might be gen. pl., and Ge’s tr. as such: “die Stämme der Menschen.” I see no reason
not to take it as the acc. pl. it appears to be, as a parallel obj. to víśaḥ, not a modifier.
40</p>
<h3 id="vi4717">VI.47.17</h3>
<p>The pū́rva-/ápara- binary returns from 15, but here I think it not only
refers to those ahead and behind positionally (as there), but also has a temporal sense
(not represented in the publ. tr.): his previous allies in pāda a he dumps in favor of
newer ones in b.
The hapax ánānubhūtīḥ is not entirely clear, but two things must be kept in
mind: 1) it’s a fem. pl., presumably acc.; 2) its sense must be derived from ánu
√bhū, which generally means ‘come close to, give way to’. Because of 1), it should
modify śarádaḥ ‘autumns’, a fem. cons. stem (so Ge). But Ge’s rendering “dass sie
an ihm nicht wahrgenommen werden” seems distant in sense from the verbal lexeme;
Old’s “(alles) Sichnichtanschliessen …” seems closer. I take the cmpd as a bahuvrīhi
meaning ‘having no intimacy’ and interpr. it as proleptic in an expression of purpose:
Indra shakes off the years so that they do not come close/attach themselves to him.
(Ge’s “dass sie … nicht …” has the same proleptic purpose interpr.) The point is that
one can’t get old if one keeps the years at a distance; my “close in” is meant to
capture the slangy tone of the passage (see also “double-cross” in b).</p>
<h3 id="vi4718">VI.47.18</h3>
<p>This vs. concerns Indra’s shape-shifting propensity, enabled by his māyā́-.
It is a slightly more complex formulation of III.53.8 rūpám-rūpam maghávā
bobhavīti, māyā́ḥ krṇ̥ vānás tanvàm pári svā́m “Form after form the bounteous one
assumes, wrapping his own body in tricks.” Although prátirūpo babhūva should lit.
mean “he has become one having a form corresponding …,” this seemed awkward.
Ge thinks the form in b is Indra’s true form, to be recognized behind the
various disguises in pāda a; by contrast, I think each form Indra assumes is meant for
display and none of them is the “real” one. práti √cakṣ is the lexeme used for the
display of the girl at the svayaṃvara; see its use with Dawn in I.113.11 and 124.8.
Each constituency is shown a different form—hence the āmreḍita rūpáṃ-rūpam in a
and the thousand horses in d, which presumably take each different form of Indra in
a different direction.</p>
<h3 id="vi4719">VI.47.19</h3>
<p>This vs. makes a small ring with vs. 15, both containing káḥ +
SUBJUNCTIVE. The fact that this vs. is in a different meter (Bṛhatī, not Triṣṭubh) from
the whole hymn that precedes it may also signal the end of a section. As indicated in
the publ. intro., I think this vs. is meant as reassurance: in contrast to the endlessly
multiplying Indra of vs. 18 (and the fickle Indra of the previous vss.), Tvaṣṭar has
now taken control, yoking only a single team (for Indra’s journey, in my opinion)
and exerting his dominion over forms, thus reining in Indra’s excess shape-shifting.
Although the word rūpá- does not appear in the vs., it can be easily supplied with
bhū́ri on the basis of Tvaṣṭar’s well-known role as shaper of forms (cf. Macd., Ved.
Myth. 116, and passages like I.188.9, VIII.10.28, X.100.9, 184.1).
The 2nd hemistich poses a rhetorical question about Indra (unnamed): why
would Indra stick by the enemy when our sacrifice is so appealing? We are
essentially urging him to switch sides again, and since he does so frequently, we have
hope of succeeding.

Assuming that pákṣa in sandhi represents pákṣaḥ (so Pp), it belongs to a neut.
s-stem found only here in the RV, but attested in AV and elsewhere. This requires us
to allow an acc. with √ās ‘sit’, rather than the usual loc. There is no warrant to
emend the accent to pakṣá and take it as a loc. to the -á-stem.
Pāda d constitutes a loc. abs., with the part. ā́sīna- used pregnantly for ‘sitting
(a sattra)’. The introductory utá is curious, since there is nothing it can
conventionally conjoin. Klein (DGRV 45–56) classifies it with the unclassifiable
residue of utá forms, tr. it ‘especially’. The publ. tr. follows this tack. However, I
think we can derive it from the standard uses of utá ‘and’. English has an idiom in
which ‘and’ is used to add as an afterthought what the speaker considers the
clinching, but somewhat off-topic, circumstantial argument &ndash; as in a sequence like
“why would he break up with her now&ndash; and with her just graduated?”</p>
<h3 id="vi4720">VI.47.20</h3>
<p>The pres. part. satī́in b is concessive, while saté in the same position in d
is not.</p>
<h3 id="vi4721">VI.47.21</h3>
<p>My tr. differs conceptually and syntactically from Ge’s, also, to a lesser
degree, from Schmidt’s (B+I 83). Ge thinks the obj. sadṛ́śīḥ … kṛṣṇā́ḥ … jā́ḥ refers
to the nights (“die … gleichen (Nächte), die schwarzen Kinder”) and that anyám
árdham “the other side” is the goal to which Indra drove the nights. Acdg. to him,
this is a different image of the singer’s Not &ndash; the first narrowness, the second
unbroken night. I find the supposed change of topic, from the tight place in which we
found ourselves in vs. 20, unlikely; instead I consider this vs. a continuation of vs.
20, in which Indra drives away the enemy, as often described as black or dark, that
implicitly hemmed us in, a view shared by Schmidt. However, the latter agrees with
Ge in taking anyám árdham as a goal, “Täglich vertrieb er die gleichen schwarzen
Kinder von ihrem Sitz an die andere (Welt-)Hälfte,” whereas I consider it a
characterization of the enemy and so in apposition to sadṛ́śīḥ … kṛṣṇā́ḥ … jā́ḥ, the
phrase into which it’s interleaved. The “other half” would be the alternately favored
and disfavored sides in vss. 15–18, as well as the “side of the hostile” (dviṣatáḥ
pákṣaḥ) of 19c.
HvN disassemble the sandhi across cd as vasnayánta, but this dual must have
a long final; so Pp.
The part. vasnayántā is a hapax, but related to vasná- ‘price’, vásnya- ‘to be
sold, up for sale’. It modifies the two enemies of Indra, Varcin and Śambara, of
whom we know little beyond Indra’s enmity towards them. The denom. vasna-yá- is
therefore interpretable in a number of ways. Gr takes it as ‘feilschen’ (haggle), while
Ge tr. ‘Lösegeld fordern’ (demand ransom), calling the two enemies Raubritter
(robber barons) in his intro. (p. 144). EWA posts both tr., though they do not seem at
all equivalent to me. Schmidt returns to Gr’s feilschen. I add yet another possibility -</p>
<ul>
<li>‘mercenaries’ &ndash; on the basis of a literal rendering of normal denom. semantics
‘seek X’, hence ‘seek a price’. But given the state of our ignorance about these two
foes, no interpr. is secure (though I very much doubt that the two were ‘haggling’
with Indra when he picked up his vajra). We should note that in the next vs. (22c),
42
we accept “the goods belonging to Śambara” (śāmbaráṃ vásu), which may refer to
Śambara’s vasná- in 21, though not in a way that disambiguates it.
Gr takes udávraje as a PN, Ge as a place name. My tr. follows Schmidt’s
interpr. (83–84) as a bahuvrīhi ‘dessen Hürde das Wasser ist’, as a description of a
mountain surrounded (or semi-surrounded) by a body of water.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vi4722">VI.47.22</h3>
<p>kóśayī- is a hapax; its difference, if any, from well-attested kóśa-, which
also appears in the following vs., in the same number of ‘ten’, can’t be determined.</p>
<h3 id="vi4725">VI.47.25</h3>
<p>The verb abhy àyaṣṭa is problematic, at least in my view. It is supposed to
be the 3rd sg. mid. root aor. to √yaj ‘sacrifice’. The form is morphologically
impeccable, but 1) abhí is not found with √yaj anywhere else in the RV, or indeed in
Vedic; 2) for √yaj ‘sacrifice to’ to take an acc. of humans, rather than the standard
gods, is skirting blasphemy. In this passage it is said to mean ‘honor’, but it is hard to
see how the ubiquitous root √yaj could be so bleached, nor why the addition of the
preverb abhí would effect this change. The publ. tr. “has reached towards” reflects a
different analysis. I suggest that it actually belongs to the root aor. of √(n)aś ‘reach,
attain’, which does appear fairly regularly with abhí. A putative injunc. in this
lexeme, *abh(í)y aṣṭa, could have produced a segmentation *abhí-yaṣṭa, and in turn
an augmented form abhí ayaṣṭa could have been generated to it. The sense of the
passage might be similar to the current (annoying) English idiom “reach out to,”
meaning “proactively contact in a positive way,” and refer to the Sārñjaya’s transfer
of goods to the Bharadvāja poets. However, I recognize that it is generally preferable
not to posit such a morphological misunderstanding and reformation, and also that
my semantic substitution isn’t altogether compelling. MLW suggests an alternative
etymology, connecting it to yáśas- ‘glory’, etc. and taking it as a med. root formation
meaning ‘made famous, ennobled, glorified’. Both the morphology and the root
semantics would work, though I am somewhat skeptical that a middle formation of
that sort would have transitive-factitive sense.
VI.47.26–31: These vss. are repeated in the Aśvamedha section of several early
Vedic ritual texts, directly after the 1st 14 vss. of the weapon hymn VI.75 (e.g., VS
XXIX.52-57, TS IV.6.6.</p>
<h3 id="vi4726">VI.47.26</h3>
<p>Because of the hí, I have made ab the causal foundation for the beginning
of c. If we are willing to allow hí to be some kind of unspecified emphatic, the
clauses can be disjoined, with the first hemistich simply “you should become …”
As in the matching sequence … pratáraṇaḥ suvī́raḥ in I.91.19, ‘lifetime’
could be supplied as the implicit obj. of pratáraṇah.</p>
<h3 id="vi4727">VI.47.27</h3>
<p>The awkward ‘strongness’ in English tr. is meant to represent the
difference between ójas- ‘strength’ in pāda a, the standard nominal abstract to this
root, and ojmán-, found only here in the RV, though attested in subsequent Vedic
texts.
43
Although the ref. to the chariot in vs. 26 is hardly transparent, in this vs. it has
become a barely solvable riddle. In particular, “the strongness of the waters enclosed
by cows” (apā́m ojmā́nam pári góbhir ā́vṛtam) could not be interpr. without 26a, c:
the “strongness of the waters” is presumably the tree (vánas-páti- in 26a, 27b), or
rather the wood of the tree &ndash; so called because plants grow only when watered.
“Enclosed by cows” recalls 26c “knotted together with cows’ (hide)” (góbhiḥ
sáṃnaddhaḥ), referring to the leather that binds the wooden parts.</p>
<h3 id="vi4728">VI.47.28</h3>
<p>Why the chariot is all the things it’s implicitly identified with in ab is not
entirely clear: it is the mace of Indra presumably because it performs similar assaults,
and the face of the Maruts presumably because its front is as glittery and fast-moving
as they are. But the Mitra and Varuṇa identifications elude me.</p>
<h3 id="vi4731">VI.47.31</h3>
<p>Ge explains pāda a persuasively as “Raub und Wiederraub der Kühe,” with
the ‘yonder ones’ (amū́ḥ) those belonging to the enemy and the ones here (imā́ḥ) our
own.
I do not understand why cáranti is accented. Ge takes it as implicitly
subordinated (“Wenn … sich sammeln”), which would account for the accent, but
there’s no other evidence for subordination. It could be ascribed to the vague
principle that the verb is accented in a clause that provides the basis for the next
clause, as Old suggests only to question (ZDMG 60: 725 n. 1 = KlSch. p. 200).
VI.48 Agni and Maruts
Renou treats this hymn in EVP XV (142–46).</p>
<h3 id="vi481">VI.48.1</h3>
<p>I take the two pādas of the first hemistich as entirely parallel, with an instr.
āmreḍita followed by a dat. of benefit/purpose. Others (Ge, Re, Klein [āmreḍitas])
instead interpr. dákṣase as a infinitive or quasi-infinitive.
The 2nd hemistich has disharmony of number between the expressed subject,
pl. vayám, and the 1st sg. verb śaṃsiṣam, a rare but not unheard-of phenomenon. Here
we can link it to the āmreḍitas that dominate the vs., esp. the doubled preverb prápra, in tmesis from the finite śaṃsiṣaṃ. Perhaps this serves as a sort of individuating
feature: “I after I …,” that is, “we.” This cannot be conveyed in Engl., though I admit
that the publ. tr. “we — that is, I —” is itself barely English.</p>
<h3 id="vi482">VI.48.2</h3>
<p>The first hemistich of this vs. is problematic. First, the acc. phrase ūrjó
nápātam referring to Agni should be (and indeed must be) the obj. of dā́śema ‘we
would ritually serve’, but this DIR.OBJ + VERB sequence is interrupted by a
parenthetical nominal clause apparently referring to Agni in the nominative (sá …
ayám). Further, the make-up of the complex hinā́yám is much discussed. As it
happens, I devoted a brief article to just this expression (“RV sá hinā́yám (VI.48.2)
with a Return Visit to nā́yám and nā́nā,” Fs. H. H. Hock, 2013). There I suggest that
the proper segmentation is *hí nā́ayám, with the particle hí, which has lost its accent
in the confusion, the nom. sg. nā́to nár- ‘man’, a form otherwise not found
44
independently until the Amarakośa, extracted from the old āmreḍita nā́-nā ‘man after
man’, used adverbially to mean ‘every man for himself, on his own’, plus the near
deictic ayám. Alternative views are discussed in the art. cit.</p>
<h3 id="vi483">VI.48.3</h3>
<p>The second hemistich has two alliterative etymological figures: c śocíṣā
śóśucac chuce and d sudītíbhiḥ sú dīdihi. The second is esp. nice, with su- ‘good’ as
the first cmpd. member echoed by sú the independent particle.</p>
<h3 id="vi484">VI.48.4</h3>
<p>Pāda a juxtaposes two 2nd sg. forms of √yaj, the indic. pres. yájasi and the -
si-impv. yákṣi, in separate clauses. This juxtaposition presumably accounts for the
accent on yájasi.
In d the obj. must be vā́jā, extracted from vā́jotá. Grammatically this should
be a dual, but a dual is semantically unlikely (Old “Dual vā́jā ist gewiss nicht
anzunehmen”). Best to take it as a pseudo-/nonce neut. pl. For the phrase cf. (as Ge
does) I.48.11 vā́jaṃ hí váṃsva; on this basis it is likely that vā́jā is obj. of both rā́sva
and váṃsva, although the position of utá associates it esp. with rā́sva.</p>
<h3 id="vi485">VI.48.5</h3>
<p>On píprati as ‘carry to term’, a specialization of ‘carry to the far shore’, see
comm. ad I.156.3, also in a birth context. Most take it as belonging to ‘fill’ (Gr, Re),
while Ge tr. ‘nähren’ and considers it a blend of the two roots √pṝ (n. 5ab). Rather
than assigning it to ‘fill’, I prefer to think that it participates in a word play with
papraú ‘has filled’ in the next vs. (6a).</p>
<h3 id="vi489">VI.48.9</h3>
<p>Although ūtyā́could be taken with the impv., the instr. of ūtí- has a robust
relationship with citrá- elsewhere (e.g. I.172.1, II.17.8, IV.23.2, VI.10.5, VI.26.5).
vidā́in the Saṃhitā text can represent either a lengthened form of the impv.
vida or a subj. vidā́ḥ (so Pp., also Gr, Lub). Both Ge and Re tr. as an impv. (as do I),
which fits the imperatival tone of the hymn better than a subjunctive.; see esp.
parallel codaya in b. Although neither Gr nor Lub gives other imperatives to this
stem, most of the forms analyzed as vidā́ḥ are better taken as imperatives like this
one (e.g., I.36.14, 71.7, VIII.61.7).
The particle tú, which ordinarily takes standard 2nd position, is out of place
here. The same sequence, tucé tú naḥ, is also found in VIII.27.14, where it is also out
of place. I have no explanation.</p>
<h3 id="vi4810">VI.48.10</h3>
<p>párṣi … partṛ́bhiḥ “deliver to the further shore with deliverers” both
continues the ‘ford’ motif of the last vs. and picks up the same verb in 5b, where it
has more restricted semantics.
Pādas b and c contain two different forms of √yu ‘keep away’: the negated
adj. áprayutvan- lit. ‘not distant / absent, not inattentive’ and the impv. yuyodhi.
Note the chiastic figure héḷāṁsi daívyā &hellip; [á]devāni hvárāṁsi ca. The inner
terms, daívyā … ádevāni, are of course etymologically related, but, though both neut.
pl. a-stems, have different endings; the outer terms, héḷāṁsi … hvárāṁsi are paired
only by their initial h- and their neut. pl. s-stem ending -āṃsi. The ca is of course
45
misplaced: we would expect *ádevāni ca hvárāṁsi. Klein (DGRV I.53) says that
ádevāni hvárāṁsi “is treated as an indivisible unit, and ca is therefore displaced to
third position,” but this is a description, not an explanation. I would suggest that the
poet didn’t want to interrupt his pretty chiasmus. (The placement of ca also enables
an iambic finish to the pāda, whereas the expected order would not, but I doubt if this
is the major reason.)

<h3 id="vi4812">VI.48.12</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. renders dhúkṣata as if it were a subjunctive (“will milk out”;
sim. Ge) to an s-aor., but the form must be an injunctive to a sa-aor., given the
augmented forms ádhukṣata, etc., and the sec. ending -ta. Of course, the injunc.
could be used modally, but a presential “who milks out” might be better.</p>
<h3 id="vi4813">VI.48.13</h3>
<p>With Ge I take dhukṣata, identical save for the accent to dhúkṣata in 12b,
as a 2nd pl. act. impv., not a 3rd sg. mid. injunc. In a n. (13a) Ge allows the possibility
of the latter analysis, which would produce the paradox that a cow is milking a cow.
Re opts for this latter analysis &ndash; the cow milking herself. Although I am always
quick to see paradox in the RV, in this case I think the poet is playing with
morphology instead, while bringing the final vs. of this 3-vs. sequence back to the 2nd
pl. impvs. of vs. 11.
Note the direct object in balanced coordination, NOUN ca ADJ / NOUN ca ADJ,
with both ca-s properly positioned (unlike 10cd above) and with each bahuvrīhi
epithet having the shape viśvá-CoCasam.
VI.48.14–19: On these Pūṣan vss., see publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="vi4814">VI.48.14</h3>
<p>Despite the change in topic, sṛprá-bhojasam (a) responds to viśvábhojasam, which ends the previous vs. (13c).
The enclitic vaḥ in Wackernagel’s position in pāda a must wait for the verb
stuṣe towards the end of d to find its syntactic niche. It refers, as usual, to the fellow
priests on whose behalf the poet will praise the god. Ge’s “Diesen euren (Gott)” (sim.
Re), attempting to find a function for it within the first pāda, is unnecessary.
This vs. contains four gods to whom Pūṣan is compared and four adjectives. It
is therefore not surprising that both Ge and Re distribute one adjective per god. My
tr. differs: it honors the pāda boundary between c and d, which sequesters the twoadjective sequence mandráṃ sṛprábhojasam in the pāda with Aryaman, leaving
Viṣṇu shorn of any epithet. This decision wasn’t made only on the basis of the pāda
boundary (which would be weak evidence), but also because sṛprá-bhojas-
‘providing lush nourishment’ is an adjective more appropriate to the hospitable
Aryaman than to Viṣṇu. See Thieme, Fremdling 105, 143; M+A 83. By contrast,
Viṣṇu and Pūṣan are often mentioned next to each other, almost as if interchangeable
46
(e.g. VI.17.11, VIII.54.5, with the pāda-opening pūṣā́víṣṇuḥ) and without
descriptors.
The final infinitival ādíśe can be taken in a number of ways: Ge (fld. by Scar
221–22) rather whimsically as “um (ihm) einen Wink zu geben,” while Re instead
gives “pour attirer-son-attention.” I do not think it can be separated from the two
forms of ā́√diś (including vs.-final ādíśe as here) in the nearby Pūṣan hymn VI.56.1.
In that vs. I take the lexeme as meaning ‘designate (X as Y=epithet)’, and I think
something similar is meant here: by giving Pūṣan attributes and identifying him with
various gods I&rsquo;ve uniquely identified him.</p>
<h3 id="vi4815">VI.48.15</h3>
<p>This vs. not only continues the identification of Pūṣan with other gods &ndash;
here the Maruts, characterized by three different descriptors &ndash; but is syntactically
dependent on the previous vs. and its verb stuṣe. It also contains the first mention of
Pūṣan himself (pāda b), at the end of the series of identifications.
The three adjectives, tveṣám, tuviṣváṇi, and anarvā́nam, must qualify both the
śárdhaḥ ‘troop’ of the Maruts, a neut. acc. s-stem, in the simile, and pūṣáṇam, a
masc. acc. -n-stem, in the frame. They seem to split the difference with regard to
gender: tveṣám is of course ambiguous as to gender, but tuviṣváṇi is neut. and
anarvā́nam masc. The latter is adjacent to masc. pūṣáṇam and separated by the pāda
boundary from the neut. phrase, so it is not surprising that it would adopt a masc.
form. Moreover, a proper neut. acc. to this stem would be *anarvá, which almost
fatally obscures the 2nd member of the bahuvrīhi. The same substitution of masc. acc.
anarvā́nam for expected neut. *anarvá- is found with the very same neut. acc.
referent śárdho mā́rutam in I.37.1; cf. comm. there. The expected neut. NA
presumably underlies the them. adj. anarvá-; see comm. ad I.185.3. Ge’s and Re’s
strategy of taking anarvā́ṇam as only modifying Puṣan (e.g., Ge “den unerreichten
Pūṣan, der …”) is thus both unnecessary and probably wrong, given its application
(not in a simile) to the Marut troop in I.37.1.</p>
<h3 id="vi4816">VI.48.16</h3>
<p>The little nominal clause aghā́aryó árātayaḥ with its unremarkable
sentiment (“evil are the hostilities of the stranger”) may have been a popular saying,
as it’s found in the same form nearby in VI.59.8, an Indra-Agni hymn. It is not clear
to me why Pūṣan would care or why the speaker seems to impart it as a secret.</p>
<h3 id="vi4817">VI.48.17</h3>
<p>This vs. seems to continue the poet’s direct speech to Pūṣan, and if it is
meant to be a secret, it will remain so: as noted in the publ. intro. the vs. is close to
unintelligible. My interpr. differs markedly from those of others (or rather, from that
of others: Re and Klein [DGRV I.289] basically follow Ge; Old, however, differs
from them in cd, suggesting several other alternatives, none of which he stands
behind).
The first pāda is deceptively straightforward, at least syntactically. It is a
prohibition against uprooting a particular kind of tree. The tree name, however, is a
hapax, with un-Ārya phonology (kākambī́ra- with plain b), and why this tree should
be left in the ground is unsaid. As for the word, it’s possible that it’s a partial
47
scrambling of Pūṣan’s epithet karambhā́d- ‘gruel-eater’ (VI.56.1), but even if so, it
doesn’t get us anywhere.
The next pāda shows some word-order disturbances that cause me to interpret
it differently from the standard and in fact to make a small emendation to the text.
The text as transmitted reads áśastīr ví hí nī́naśaḥ, with, apparently, a preverb in
tmesis in 2nd position (ví) and the particle hí in 3rd position. Both of these would be
quite unusual, though it must be admitted that in this kind of informal speech we
might expect deviations from normal order. The hí also suggests that the pāda offers
the causal grounds for either the preceding clause or the following one. Ge and Re
choose the former option, but I don’t see how pāda a follows from pāda b as rendered
by them, at least given our ignorance of significance of the Kākambīra tree. To
address the word-order problems I suggest that instead of ví hí we read *vihí, the 2nd
sg. impv. to √vī ‘pursue’. (An asterisk should be inserted in the publ. tr. before
‘pursue’.) Although this impv. is more often vīhí with long root vowel (as in nearby
VI.50.2), there are several exx. with short root vowel (e.g., III.21.5, where the short
vowel is metrically favored and perhaps guaranteed). Given the obscurity of this vs.,
it would not be surprising if the puzzled redactors split the syllables and endowed ví
with an accent as if it were a preverb. If my reading is accepted, we have either a sort
of serial verb construction: “come on (and) destroy,” or simply a chronological
series: “pursue and destroy.” The latter is reflected in the publ. tr. By my interpr. the
redupl. aor. nī́naśaḥ is accented because it starts a new clause. Unfortunately I cannot
explain why we have a redupl. aor. injunc. rather than a caus. impv. (*nāśaya)
following the 1st impv.
My interpr. of the 2nd hemistich diverges from the standard even more, taking
Klein’s tr. (DGRV I.289) to stand also for Ge’s and Re’s: “And may the sun not
(shine) for even a day for the one who grasps the neck of the bird.” We all agree that
mótá stands for mā́+ utá, with utá conjoining the two prohibitive particles in a and c.
Beyond this, anyone confronting this hemistich must deal with several textual
problems: 1) the meter of c is disturbed; in fact Old calls it “hoffnungslos”; 2) it is
difficult to decide what underlies the transmitted sequence áha evā́; the Pp. takes áha
as áhar, but, needless to say, this sandhi would be unusual; 3) evā́with long final is
almost always pāda- or clause-initial, as opposed to generally 2nd-position evá (see
Lub s.vv.). In fact, in Minkowski’s detailed treatment of the two forms (JAOS 115.3
[1995]: 388–400) this particular passage is “the only one possible counterexample”
(p. 391) to this rule of placement. (With Old, Minkowski floats the possibility that
two syllables are missing after áha, producing an 8-syll. pāda, with evā́caná then
pāda-initial in a 12-syl. one. Since it is impossible to know what those missing 2
syllables might have been and since, all things being equal, we’d prefer a Satobṛhatī
vs. [see publ. intro.], which would have 12 8, not 8 12, as its 2nd half, I will deal with
the text we have.) In addition to these formal problems, there are a few crucial
lexical ambiguities: 1) sū́raḥ can be nom. sg. of the thematic stem sū́ra- or gen./abl.
sg. of the athem. stem svàr-; 2) as noted above, the underlying form of áha is
unclear: does it belong somehow to the ‘day’ word (áhar, áhan-) or is it the
asserverative particle áha? 3) véḥ, which should be read as a disyllable, can be a case
48
forms of the ‘bird’ word (ví-), either nom. or gen./abl. sg., or a verb form to √vī
‘pursue’. The standard interpr. presented above chooses the first of each of those
lexical alternatives; in all instances I choose the 2nd.
The standard tr., with ‘sun’ as subject, supplies ‘shine’ as the verb; no
justification is given by anyone who so interprets it (as far as I’ve been able to find).
My interpr. attempts to find some clues in context. There are a few; whether they are
false trails or not I cannot be certain. The first is the verb of pāda a, which is
presented as parallel to pāda c by the mā́… móta construction. The verb is úd √vṛh
‘tear up’. Various forms of √vṛh are found in the often puzzling “wheel of the sun”
myth, describing the ripping off of this wheel. Cf. I.130.9 sū́raś cakrám prá vr̥hat …;
I.174.5 prá sū́raś cakrám vrhat ̥ ād abhī́ke [=IV.16.2]; V.29.10 prā́nyác cakrám avr̥haḥ
sū́ryasya. In two of these three passages the gen. sg. of ‘sun’ is sū́raḥ. Although this
is slender evidence, it is, at least, evidence (as opposed to the random fantasy of the
standard tr.), and I therefore borrow the verb √vṛh from pāda a and supply ‘wheel’ as
its obj., with a dependent gen. sū́raḥ. This is supported by a nearby passage in a
Pūṣan hymn, VI.56.3 utā́dáḥ paruṣé gávi, sū́raś cakráṃ hiraṇyáyam / ny aìrayad
rathī́tamaḥ “And yonder golden wheel of the Sun he set down in the ‘gray cow’ &ndash; he
the best charioteer.” (This is the same hymn that contains the form ādíśe disc. above
ad vs. 14.) It is not at all clear what story that passage is telling, but we can see that
Pūṣan, who is our addressee here, changes the placement of a detached “wheel of the
sun,” with the sun-genitive sū́raḥ as here. The detachment might results from tearing
the wheel off the chariot of the sun. This chain of reasoning accounts for my tr. of the
first part of pāda c: “And certainly don&rsquo;t (tear off the wheel) of the sun.” I am taking
áha as the particle, not a form of ‘day’ (though ‘day’ could be worked into that tr.).
Of course this interpr. does not solve the sandhi problem: we should expect áhaivā́.
But if a new clause begins with evā́, as I think it does, the unusual sandhi break
would be more understandable.
Starting a new clause solves the problem of non-initial evā́noted above. But
what is the content of the clause? Like the standard tr., I take ādádhate as a dat. sg.
pres. act. participle, with grīvā́ḥ ‘necks’ as object. However, I do not think this refers
to the neck(s) of a/the bird. Instead, as noted above, I take véḥ as a verb form to √vī;
given my emendation in pāda b to *vihí, véḥ to the same root would follow naturally
(or as naturally as we’re going to get in this vs.). Given its disyllabic reading, I take it
as standing for *váyas, the 2nd sg. subjunctive to the root present. I’m assuming that
Pūṣan wants to give chase to (or at least follow) whoever does whatever he’s doing
to the necks, and if he (Pūṣan) tears off the wheel of the sun, he won’t be able to. As
for grīvā́ḥ √dhā, I conjecture that this describes one action in the harnessing of
horses to the chariot. Note √dhā in VII.34.4 ā́dhūrṣú asmai dádhātā́śvān “Put the
horses to the chariot poles for him,” and recall that the horse Dadhikrā is “bound at
the neck” (grīvā́yām baddháḥ) in IV.40.4. But the “place necks” phrase is open to
multiple possibilities, none of which imposes itself.
There are a couple of grammatical loose ends in this extremely loosely
constructed interpr.: 1) dative complements are rare to √vī, 2) véḥ is accented,
though there’s no obvious trigger for the accent. It may be that it borrowed the accent
49
from my putative *vihí, or that the implied causal dependency of the evā́clause (thus
my “for thus never …”) induced it. Or that the redactors had no idea what this meant
(a mental confusion we share) and took it as a form of ‘bird’.
To lay out my reasoning in detail is, I realize, not necessarily to convince &ndash;
but at least there is reasoning every step of the way. I challenge other interpr. to
provide the same!</p>
<h3 id="vi4818">VI.48.18</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take the comparison to be between the partnership and the
leather bag (e.g., Ge “Deine … Freundschaft soll sein wie der … Schlauch”), but the
partnership is in the nom. (sakhyám) and the bag is in the gen. (dṛ́teḥ), as is Pūṣan
(te). Given the deep uncertainty of this part of the hymn, grammar is all we have to
hold onto, and grammar tells us that it is Pūṣan who is compared to the bag. For the
partnership with Pūṣan, see I.138.4fg.</p>
<h3 id="vi4821">VI.48.21</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take the rel. cl. of ab as unconnected with the rest of the vs. But
surely the yásya refers to Indra, as is made clear by the ‘Vṛtra-smashing’ references
in de.
The adj. vṛtrahám, twice modifying neut. śávaḥ (d, e), is attributed to a hapax
thematic stem vṛtra-há- by Gr (see also Re’s comm.), beside the very well-attested
root noun cmpd. vṛtra-hán-. Although this analysis must be synchronically correct, I
wonder if the form here has not been re-marked from the expected neut. to the root
noun, which should probably be *vṛtra-há. However, MLW suggests that the neut.
could have been simply the sten form *vṛtrahán, which could be misheard as
vṛtrahám. See also disc. of satrā-hám ad V.35.4 and also of anarvám ad I.185.3. The
re-marking must already have happened and the thematic stem extracted before the
composition of this passage, since the -am ending makes position in the cadence.</p>
<h3 id="vi4822">VI.48.22</h3>
<p>The first half of this vs. is straightforward: both Heaven and Earth were
born only once. The same “only once” (sakṛ́t) appears in pāda c as well, but with the
mention of Pṛśni things get complicated, esp. when pāda d is taken into account. The
hemistich reads pṛ́śnyā dugdháṃ sakṛ́t páyas, tád anyó nā́nu jāyate. Pāda c is
unproblematically “only once was the milk of Pr̥śni milked.” Ge takes the milk here
to be, symbolically, the Maruts; the point of the pāda is that Pṛśni “ward nur einmal
Mutter.” (In this I think he is correct.) His d is “Nach dem wird kein anderer
geboren” (sim. Re “(nul) autre ne naît à la suite de (tout) cela”), both with an
indefinite reading of anyáḥ as ‘(no) other’; the publ. tr. also has an indefinite reading,
but limited to the Maruts &ndash; that is, the Maruts were born all at once and no other
Maruts followed: “Another (of the Maruts) is not born after this.” But all of these
interpr., however easily they go down, should be wrong. As I have demonstrated at
length (“Vedic anyá- &lsquo;another, the other&rsquo;: syntactic disambiguation,” Fs. Beekes,
1997, pp. 11–18), indefinite and definite readings of anyá- are distinguished
positionally: 2nd position anyá-, as here, is definite. (For a clear ex. see in the next
hymn VI.49.3b with an anyá- … anyá- “the one … the other” construction.) Our
pāda d should mean “the other is not born after this.” This passage needs to be
50
considered in conjunction with VI.66.1 márteṣv anyád doháse pīpā́ya, sakṛ́c chukráṃ
dudhe pṛ́śnir ū́dhaḥ, whose 2nd pāda is very close to our pāda c. VI.66.1 has an
implicit anyá- … anyá- construction: the anyád in the 1st pāda refers to Pṛśni’s udder
and is contrasted with the ū́dhaḥ in the 2nd pāda, which invites a reading with a
second *anyád. The publ. tr. renders this “while the one stays swollen to give milk to
mortals, only once did Pr̥śni milk the gleaming (milk/semen) from (the other) udder.”</p>
<h3 id="vi661">VI.66.1</h3>
<p>is only limited help, however. Although its 2nd pāda is, as just noted,
semantically and formulaically very comparable to our first, and its first pāda
contains a form of anyá- as our 2nd one does, there are several important
discrepancies: the anyá- in VI.66.1 is neut. and therefore pairs easily with the ū́dhaḥ
of the following pāda, but our passage contains a masc. anyáḥ which cannot be
directly referred to the (neut.) milked páyaḥ of the preceding passage nor to Pṛśni’s
(neut.) udder, which must be lurking in the passage too. Moreover, though the sakṛ́t
pādas of our vs. (abc) refer to a discrete event in the past, the verb of d, the anyápāda, is present (ánu jāyate).
I can see two ways of handling this problematic pāda, an easy one and a hard
one. In the easy one I ignore my own rule about anyá- placement and take anyáḥ as
indefinite, with a tr. similar to Ge/Re: “no other is born following this” / “another is
not born following this.” The publ. tr. “Another (of the Maruts) is not born after this”
was adapted from von Bradke (Fs. Roth 118) and was an attempt to limit the scope of
indefinite ‘other’ to “other Maruts” and therefore wring a semi-definite sense out of
it. But that’s a cop-out: it’s still indefinite, and the more general rendering of Ge/Re
may be more satisfactory if we are going the indefinite route.
Although this is the easier alternative, I am not at all sure it’s the wrong one &ndash;
though I’m reluctant to toss out the anyá- rule without a struggle. The harder way
makes reference to yet another desperate Pṛśni udder passage, this one II.34.2: rudró
yád vo marutaḥ …, vṛ́ṣā́jani pṛ́śnyāḥ śukrá ū́dhani “when Rudra was begotten for
you as the blazing bullish (semen = rain?) in the udder of Pr̥śni, o Maruts.” For the
difficulties of this passage and my interpr. of it, see comm. ad loc. The passage
refers, in my view, to the birth (or a birth) of the Maruts’ father Rudra, which “birth”
then led to the birth of the Maruts. Acdg. to this passage, Rudra took shape (“was
born”) as “bullish semen” in Pṛśni’s udder. As I say in my comm. ad loc., “It is this
semen that combines with Pṛśni to produce the Maruts; it can also, in naturalistic
terms, be the rain in the thunderclouds that are Pṛśni’s udder. This gender mingling
and loss of distinction between the Maruts’ bull-father (=Rudra) and their mother
Pṛśni in the udder are also found, in somewhat different fashion, in IV.3.10d vṛ́ṣā
śukráṃ duduhe pṛ́ṣnir ū́dhaḥ ‘the bull as Pr̥śni milked gleaming (milk/semen) from
his (/her) udder’ and in VI.66.1d sakṛ́c chukráṃ duduhe pṛ́ṣnir ū́dhaḥ ‘only once did
Prś̥ ni milk the gleaming (milk/semen) from the udder.’”
I now think it possible (though only that) that the masc. anyá- of our passage
refers to Rudra (and/or his semen); in that case the referent is definite (as my rule
requires), and the pāda means “The other [=Rudra] is not born after this,” in other
words, the normal order of nature prevails: the father/semen was born in Pṛśni’s
udder before the sons, the Maruts, who resulted from the mingling of those essences
51
and who were “milked out” of that udder &ndash; a bit of an anticlimax, to be sure: we
wouldn’t in fact expect Rudra’s birth to follow his sons’. I am not sure that this is the
correct way to interpret the passage, but it does conform to the known syntactic rules
and also has suggestive connections with other troubling passages involving the same
features: Rudra, his semen, Pṛśni, her udder, her milk, and the Maruts.
VI.49 All Gods
The verb ‘quicken, enliven’ (√jinv) appears at widely scattered intervals in
this hymn (6b jinvatam, 11c jínvathā, 14d jinvatu), but enough to count as a leitmotif.</p>
<h3 id="vi491">VI.49.1</h3>
<p>Although non-formulaic groupings of gods are frequently encountered in
All God hymns, the trio váruṇo mitró agníḥ is perhaps a little strange, since we
expect this trio’s third member to be instead Aryaman. And indeed that sequence is
quite common: there is a much-repeated dimeter pāda váruṇo mitró aryamā́(I.26.4,
etc.; see repetitions listed in Lub), and the same sequence is regularly found at the
end of a Jagatī pāda (I.40.5, V.46.5, VII.66.11, 12, etc.). I wonder if agníḥ is some
sort of makeshift substitute for aryamā́in a Triṣṭubh cadence where aryamā́wouldn’t
fit (cf. the same sequence in the acc. in the next hymn, VI.50.1, and it is found
elsewhere in both nom. and acc., incl. the repeated pāda VI.51.10). After all, Agni is
compatible with pretty much any Vedic god and could be slotted in when the more
specialized divinity was metrically inconvenient.</p>
<h3 id="vi492">VI.49.2</h3>
<p>The fuller expression in X.3.7 diváspr̥thivyór aratír yuvatyóḥ “the spoked
wheel of Heaven and Earth, the youthful ones” makes the identity of “the two
youthful ones” clear.
Ge and Re take yájadhyai as a predicated infinitive with unexpressed subject
“I” (without comment), with Agni the obj.: “… Agni … will ich verehren”; “je veux
lui sacrifier.” I instead supply “(I invoke)” (parallel to stuṣé ‘I will praise’ in 1a) to
govern agním, who is then the subject of the inf. Although this involves supplying
material, elsewhere in Agni contexts this infinitive is generally used of him, as
subject, in his priestly role. Cf., e.g., III.1.1 … mā … váhniṃ cakartha vidáthe
yájadhyai “you have made me your draught-horse, to offer the sacrifice at the ritual
distribution.” And in this hymn see VI.49.9 hótā yakṣat … agníḥ “the Hotar Agni
will sacrifice,” with Agni as agent-subject of the active verb.</p>
<h3 id="vi493">VI.49.3</h3>
<p>My tr. of sū́ro anyā́“the other is the sun’s” follows Old, who adopted it
from Ludwig. Ge (/Re) supply an instr. raśmíbhiḥ ‘with the rays’, parallel to stṛ́bhiḥ,
on which sū́raḥ depends. This seems unnec. Re’s claim that the accent on pipiśé
“déconseille l’interpretation de sū́raḥ donnée par Old.” does not convince: although
by the Old reading pipiśé is not part of both anyā́clauses as it would be with the
additional instr., it occurs at the boundary of two explicitly contrastive clauses, which
would, I think, be sufficient to induce accent.
52</p>
<h3 id="vi495">VI.49.5</h3>
<p>Note the tricky word positioning, with pāda-final yáḥ picking up pāda-init.
sá, in a nominal rel. cl. continued in the next pāda. It may be that in a structurally
simple hymn like this the poet seeks to vary the ways he introduces the listed
divinities and their attributes and to jazz up the syntax.</p>
<h3 id="vi496">VI.49.6</h3>
<p>If my comment immed. above is correct, this vs. is a fine example of it. To
begin with the surface, the first hemistich has a dual voc. (párjanyavātā) and a dual
impv. (jinvatam). So far all is well. But the 2nd hemistich has a plural voc.
(sátyaśrutaḥ kavayaḥ), whose referents are not identified, and a singular voc. (jágata
sthātar), whose referent is not identified, flanking a rel. prn. in the gen. and an instr.
pl. (yásya gīrbhíḥ), with the rest of the vs., following the singular voc., containing an
apparent main cl. verb in the 2nd pl. (ā́kṛṇudhvam [so Pp.]). The simplest thing to do
is to disjoin the two half-verses, keeping the dual and plural parts separate. But that
leaves us with an incomplete rel. cl. that has nothing to do. The problems are
discussed at length by Old, though he does not come to a firm determination.
Both Ge and Re take the first hemistich as independent, as do Old and Scar
(556). By contrast, I consider it the main cl. on which cd is dependent. Since my
interpr. of ab resembles theirs almost to the end, however, we are in happy
agreement so far. For the connection of Parjanya and Vāta with the púrīṣāni …
ápyāni “watery outpourings,” cf. X.65.9 parjányāvā́tā vṛṣabhā́purīṣínā. The only
question is whether pṛthivyā́ḥ in our passage depends on vṛṣabhā or the watery
outpourings: its accent (as opposed to unaccented voc. vṛṣabhā) speaks (weakly: see
Old comm.) for the latter, the pāda break for the former, and the consensus is for the
former. I’m not at all sure it matters.
In my interpr. of ab as the main cl. to cd, I supply a beneficial dat. “for him,”
referring to the human poet, to serve as main cl. referent for the rel. yásya in c. As
just noted, the standard interpr. take ab as an independent cl., and therefore must
account for the rel. prn. yásya in a different way. Before tackling that, let us first
determine who the vocc. in cd refer to.
The pl. voc. phrase sátyaśrutaḥ kavayaḥ beginning pāda c: by almost
universal agreement, beg. with Sāy., this refers to the Maruts, on the basis of the
pāda-spanning voc. phrase sátyaśrutaḥ kávayaḥ yúvānaḥ used of the Maruts in
V.57.8, the only other occurrences of satya-śrut-. (It is worth remarking here that,
though in both V.57.8 and here the pāda opens with the first two vocc., in V.57.8
kávayaḥ is accented, whereas here it is not. I have no explan.) The identification with
the Maruts seems reasonable, though of course nothing about the phrase uniquely
identifies the Maruts. However, note that in vs. 11 below they are addressed as
yuvānaḥ kavayaḥ, with two of the terms found in V.57.8.
As for jágata sthātar in d, most tr. leave the referent unidentified (e.g., Ge n.
6cd “Wer der jágataḥ sthātar sein soll, ist nicht deutlich.”). Since the agent noun
sthā́tar- in the sg. is otherwise used only of Indra, he seems a likely referent, esp.
because he is also regularly associated with the Maruts. The added wrinkle is that
there must be a pun here as well: the stem sthātár- (so accented) ‘the still’, always in
the form sthātúḥ, is the regular formulaic partner of jágat- ‘the moving’; cf., e.g., in
53
the next hymn, VI.50.7 víśvasya sthātúr jágataḥ. The poet’s urge to make this play
on words may have contributed both to the contorted syntax and the unclarity of
reference we’re trying to untangle.
The two referents of the vocative phrases, the Maruts and (if I’m right) Indra,
are the joint 2nd pl. subjects of the verb in d. On this, I think, we are all agreed. But
all standard interpr. follow the Pp. in taking ā̇́kṛnudhvam as an unaccented, and
therefore main clause, verb. (See, explicitly, Old “… ist offenbar Imperativ und hat
Hauptsatzakzent.”) Under this interpr., something else has to be done with the yásya
gīrbhíḥ of c. Most people supply material like mad: Ge adds a “towards him” in his
main cl. and “you take pleasure” as verb in the rel. cl.: “machet alles was lebt, (dem)
geneigt, an dessen Loblied (ihr Freude habt)” &ndash; in other words, he manufactures
most of the relative cl.; Scar similar, though he gives a wide choice of ways to fill out
the rel. cl., thus demonstrating exactly how untethered this interpr. is: “durch dessen
Lieder{ihr das könnt/ihr so heiss/ihr gepriesen werdet} (?).” Re, by contrast,
eliminates the rel. cl. by folding it into a voc.: “(toi) par les paroles de qui (les chose
se réalisent)” &ndash; though it still requires extensive material to fill it out, again based on
nothing.
My solution is to take ā́kṛṇudhvam as the verb of the rel. cl.: the Saṃhitā text
of course reads ā́kṛṇudhvam; it is only the Pp. that inserts a notional word space after
ā́. If we instead interpr. the sequence as an augmented imperfect, with accent on the
augment, that is, ā + ákṛṇudhvam (which does not require emendation), we do not
have to fill out the rel. cl., because it already has an accented verb and that verb has
an object: “you made the moving world your own.” This expression, ā́√kṛ (middle)</p>
<ul>
<li>INSTR. has close parallels, one containing gīrbhíḥ as here: cf. I.77.2 tám ū námobhir
ā́krṇ̥ udhvam / X.6.5 agníṃ gīrbhír námobhir ā́krṇ̥ udhvam. In both those passages I
tr. “attract here with reverence (and hymns).” The difference in interpr. may be
ascribed to the fact that in our passage here, the gods are subj. and the hymns come
from the human poet, whereas in the two passages just cited mortals are also the subj.
However, I may want to rethink both of those passages, to “make him [/Agni] your
own.” Since in both passages Agni is the object, he does not have to be attracted
here, since as the ritual fire he already is here.
Thus, by my interpr. all of cd is a rel. cl., dependent on a “for him” or the like
to be supplied in the main cl. of ab. Note that both Ge. (“dem”) and Scar. (“für ihn”)
must supply the same beneficial dative, but they do so with the supposed main cl.
verb ā́kṛṇudhvam in d. Although my interpr. produces an awk English tr., it accounts
for the Sanskrit considerably better than the alternatives. What it means for the gods
to “make the moving world their own” I’m not sure &ndash; but perhaps the usual RVic
notion that human praises strengthen the gods for their heroic deeds and, perhaps in
this case, that these praises bring the gods and their human worshipers (part of the
“moving world”) into a closer relationship.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="vi497">VI.49.7</h3>
<p>After the syntactic pyrotechnics of the previous vs., this one comes as a
relief. Because of the subjunctive yaṃsat ending the vs., I assume a modal value also
for dhāt ending the first hemistich, as do Ge and Re.
54</p>
<h3 id="vi498">VI.49.8</h3>
<p>With most (Gr, Ge, Re), the publ. tr. takes the hapax páripati- as ultimately
derived from √pā ‘protect’, not páti- ‘lord’. However, this analysis has grave formal
problems not solved by Re’s cavalier “hapax tiré de pā- … mais influencé, pour la
forme, par páti”: it would be quite difficult to get a short-vowel root syllable pafrom √pā by any normal derivational process. I now think that it is a cmpd. of -páti-,
even though Wackernagel’s ‘ringsum Herr’ (AiG II.1.260) reflecting this analysis is
not terribly satisfactory. My change of heart was occasioned by considering the first
verse in the first hymn of the Pūṣan cycle that begins soon after this hymn, VI.53.1,
whose first pāda ends pathas pate “o lord of the path.” I would now tr. our passage,
“the complete lord of every path.” It might be worth noting that VI.53.1 also enlists
Pūṣan’s help with our dhī́- ‘visionary thought’, as here.
Most take vacasyā́as instr. sg. to the -ā́stem vacasyā́- ‘eloquence’, requiring
a verb to be supplied (e.g., Ge “(preise ich)”). I instead interpr. it as 1st sg. act. to the
denom. vacasya- (not otherwise found accented). There are two problems with my
analysis: 1) the other two forms of the verb vacasya- are medial; 2) vacasyā́is
accented, though supposedly a main-cl. verb. The first is not too difficult: verbs of
proclaiming/praising can be labile with regard to voice. The second is more
problematic and might require me to follow the standard view, tr. “(I praise, vel sim.)
with my eloquence.” But see disc. of vardháyā in 10b, where I suggest that our
vacasyā́here is indeed a verb and has borrowed its verbal accent from vardháyā.
The phrase kā́mena kṛtáḥ is used of Pūṣan also in nearby VI.58.3–4.</p>
<h3 id="vi4910">VI.49.10</h3>
<p>The form vardháyā can be either 2nd sg. impv. (Gr, Ge) or 1st sg.
subjunctive (Re). I opt for the latter, partly because there seem to be no other
unambiguous impvs. addressed to priests/mortals in this hymn; the priestly/poetic
function is represented by 1st sg. (e.g., stuṣé 1a) and 1st pl. (e.g., huvema pāda d this
vs.) verbs. It is also accented despite pāda-medial position, presumably because it
lies in the center of a balanced construction: rudráṃ dívā … rudrám aktaú “Rudra by
day … Rudra by night.” Given this accented, non-initial, 1st sg. subj., I wonder if
vacasyā́in 8a is in fact also a verb (as in my first analysis, represented in the publ.
tr.) and has borrowed its accent from vardháyā.
Despite Ge’ and Re’s comments, considering ‘separately’ (‘allein’, ‘à part’)
for ṛ́dhak only to reject it, this must be the correct tr. In his n. 10d Ge cites II.33.4,
where we hope not to anger Rudra by invoking him with an invocation shared with
another god or gods. See comm. ad loc. The fact that Rudra’s sons are addressed in
the next vs. (11), as well as namelessly in 6cd (see above), might make the need for a
separate invocation of Rudra all the more acute.</p>
<h3 id="vi4911">VI.49.11</h3>
<p>The interpr. of varasyā́- as somehow a deriv. of vára- ‘wish’, found, e.g.,
in Gr, Ge, and AiG II.2.244, is contextually understandable: Ge’s “Kommet … zum
Bittgesuch des Sängers” makes more immediate sense than my “come hither in
response to the singer&rsquo;s longing for space,” with “in response to” smuggled in to
make the sentence somewhat more parsable. But there is no váras- to √vṝ ‘wish,
55
choose’, whereas váras- means ‘wide space’, something that RVic poets often
express a desire for. Re hesitates (his word), but opts for ‘desire for space’ and
adduces the quite apposite I.181.9 varivasyā́gṛṇānáḥ “singing (to you) with a desire
for space,” comparable to our gṛṇató varasyā́.
The causal relationship between c and ab, suggested by hí (c), is not
straightforward. But in its only other occurrence (IV.51.3), acitrá- refers to a place,
one without brightness, therefore by implication sterile and lifeless. Thus the desire
for (positive) space expressed in b is contrasted with (negative) space that the Maruts
can, nonetheless, bring to life.
I don’t understand the point of d.</p>
<h3 id="vi4912">VI.49.12</h3>
<p>This vs. contains two exx. of case disharmony between simile and frame,
one each in ab and cd.
Though Gr takes ájā as a 2nd sg. impv., both Ge and Re interpr. it as a 1st sg.
subjunctive, as do I. This would bring the count to three in this hymn, by my interpr.
(8a, 10b, 12b).
This verb takes a straightforward acc. obj. yūthā́‘herds’ in the simile, as well
as an adverbial acc. goal ástam ‘home’. But in the frame it lacks an overt obj.: I
supply ‘praise’, Ge ‘Lied’, Re ‘mon hymne’. And the goal is the personal dative of
the divinity (vīrā́ya, etc.).
The mismatch between simile and frame is greater in cd, and once again the
simile is the more straighforwardly expressed. The poet exploits the syntactic
ambiguity of intrans./trans. -áya- formations, in the form here of the redupl. aor.
pispṛsati √spṛś ‘touch’, meaning both ‘make X [acc.] touch Y [acc./loc.]’ and,
notionally passive, ‘make Y [acc.] touched by X [instr.]’. The simile uses the latter
construction: “cause the firmament (acc. nā́kam = Y) to be touched by stars (instr.
stṛ́bhiḥ =X). In the frame the X is the “inspired words” (vípaḥ, acc. pl.) and the Y is
the body (tanvì, in the loc., an alternative case to the acc. in this construction). Both
words and body are limited by genitives, referring to the poet (vacanásya ‘of the
speaker’) and the god (śrutásya ‘of the famed one’). For further disc. of the passage
and of the phenomenon in general see my “Case Disharmony.”
Our poet further muddies the waters by reversing the more common
relationship between forms of √vip and √vac. The stem vacaná- ‘speaking, speaker’,
referring to a person, is attested only 3x in the RV, whereas vácas- ‘speech’ is
ubiquitous; the root noun víp- ‘inspired (word[s])’ is not uncommon, but is far
outnumbered by the stem vípra- ‘inspired poet’. So we might have expected the
phrase *víprasya vácaḥ “the speech of the inspired poet” (cf., though not with a gen.,
VIII.61.9 vípraḥ … vácaḥ), not vacanásya vípaḥ “the inspired words of the speaker.”</p>
<h3 id="vi4913">VI.49.13</h3>
<p>Another syntactic trick, though far less complex than in the last vs. The
first half-vs., describing Viṣṇu’s cosmogonic deed, is couched in the 3rd ps., with the
pf. vimamé ‘he measured out’, but in the 2nd half, expressing our present-day desire to
live under Viṣṇu’s protection, the god is in the more intimate 2nd ps., in the phrase

te. On such doublings see my “sa figé.”

With Old I read cakrámāma, a pf. subj., not ca krámāma, pace Klein (DGRV
I.188, 190). This reading is accepted by Kü (147 and n. 146).
I take kṣáyam … yéna … abhí cakrámāma as an explicit “X and (which) Y”
construction on grounds of content: I do not think our “peaceful dwelling” (kṣáyam)
is the means by which we will trample and destroy our enemies. Instead I think we
have the usual RVic implicit contrast between war and peace (yoga-kṣemá- in one
rendition), with ‘peace’ expressed by a noun and war by an elaborate rel. cl.

<h3 id="vi501">VI.50.1</h3>
<p>The hymn begins with the 1st ps. mid. huvé ‘I invoke/call upon’, like the last
hymn, which began (VI.49.1) stuṣé ‘I will praise’.
On the ill-assorted trio Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, see comm. ad VI.49.1. Here the
phrase is in the acc., but likewise in a Triṣṭubh cadence. The expected Aryaman is
added in the next pāda.</p>

<p>It’s not clear to me which gods Sūrya is supposed to pursue. The last

Note the juxtaposition of ṛtá- and satyá-; a similar of more elaborate ex. is
found in the next hymn, VI.51.10 rtádh ̥ ītayo vakmarā́jasatyāḥ.</p>

<p>There is a surprising lack of agreement about the construction of this vs.
Both Ge and Re take ab as a separate clause, which requires them to supply a verb
for it (“ihr … besitzet”; “qui avez”). In cd they also both construe maháḥ in the yathā́
cl., but this is impossible, since it precedes the main verb karathaḥ. (I take maháḥ
adverbially, as often and in 6d below [by my account].) See Old for a rather fussy
disc. of various possibilities in cd. I do not see the problem with my interpr., which
has karathaḥ in c govern the accusatives in ab, with a yáthā purpose cl. taking up
most of cd (starting with várivaḥ right before the subord. conj.) This cl. lacks an
overt verb, but an existential subjunctive ásat ‘there will be’ is easy to supply. (All
interpr. must do something like this, unless they emend to accented *kárathaḥ.) Ge
(n. 3cd) worries about the tautology of … no, asmé …, which he avoids by
construing naḥ with maháḥ … várivaḥ and asmé with the NP of d (“Machet, dass uns
grosse Freibahn werde (und) unserem Wohnsitz Befreiung von allem Übel”)(sim.
Re), but I find the pronominal doubling far less troublesome than extracting a piece
57
of the subord. clause and fronting it around the main verb, as the Ge/Re interpr.
requires.</p>
<h3 id="vi505">VI.50.5</h3>
<p>Both Ge and Re take b as an indep. cl., while I interpr. it as a dependent
clause parallel to pāda a, likewise hanging off yéṣu. Either is grammatically possible,
since the verb of b síṣakti is pāda-initial and could owe its accent to that position.
And in fact there’s little actual difference in content between the two interpr.,
because both Ge and Re sneak the Maruts into the pāda anyway.
The more crucial question in b is the meaning of the hapax abhyardhayájvan-.
Most take it as expressing a hostile, oppositional, or at least separated relationship,
e.g., Ge “Gegenverehrer,” AiG II.1.67 “gesondert opfern,” Re “(dieu) recevant un
sacrifice distinct.” Certainly by the time of the BYV Saṃhitās, abhyardhá- (or -ás;
see below) is used to mean ‘apart from, separated from’; cf., e.g., MS II.5.4 (52: 14)
… yó rājanyò ‘bhyardhó viśáś carati “a Rājanya who goes about apart from his clan”
(/ Amano “… der Rājanya, der von seinem Volk abseits wandeln”). (For Amano’s
interpr. of the form as an adv. in -aḥ and her detailed discussion of its use in this
textual stratum, see her n. 2500 [that number is not a typo!].) However, in the RV
árdha- (and ardhá-) refers rather to a ‘half’ or a ‘side’. In X.26.5, a passage adduced
by Ge, Pūṣan is described as prátyardhir yajñā́nām, which even Ge tr. as “der bei den
Opfern (mit den Göttern) halbpart macht” and Sāy. glosses ardhabhak ‘half-sharer’.
The point, I think, is that Pūṣan is almost always in partnership with other gods,
indeed often in dvandvas like índrā-pūṣán- (cf. nearby VI.57.1), somā-pūṣán-, and
the only sacrifices he is likely to receive will be shared with (an)other more
prominent god or gods. In a way, this characterization of Pūṣan is the exact opposite
of Rudra in the previous hymn (VI.49.10), where it is emphasized that Rudra
receives a separate invocation, apart from the other gods. For Pūṣan’s relationship to
the Maruts, see nearby VI.48, where the Pūṣan vss. (14–19) are sandwiched between
Marut vss. (11–13, 20–21) and Pūṣan is compared to the Marut troop (VI.48.15).
Compared to later texts, the gerund is comparatively rare in the RV; the -tvā
gerund is found only 21x. The configuration of pāda c shows that the gerund phrase
(śrutvā́hávam marutaḥ) must constitute a separate syntactic unit here, since the
subord. conj. yád occurs only after the whole phrase, and it is followed by 2ndposition part. (d)ha.</p>
<h3 id="vi506">VI.50.6</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. omits the íd. I might emend it to “Just he will hear the call.”
In cd I take ca as “inverse” ca (X ca … Y, rather than normal X … Y ca)
connecting the two very similar participial phrases … úpa ca stávānaḥ, … úpa mahó
gṛṇānáḥ# “being praised and being hymned.” Klein (DGRV I.122–23, 125, 173) by
contrast takes it as conjoining the verbs of the two clauses, śrávat and rā́sat in the
configuration #śrávat … úpa ca stávāno, rā́sat …), but placed after the preverb of
the verbal lexeme in the 2nd clause (that is, by his interpr. úpa &hellip; rā́sat). Since úpa
never appears otherwise with √rā but is quite common with √stu, this interpr. seems
unlikely.
58
As noted above (ad 3c), I take maháḥ as the adverbially used -s-stem, against
the standard view that it is a masc. acc. pl. (to the stem máh-) modifying vā́jān. The
standard view is not impossible, but given the paired úpa … PART construction, word
order favors taking maháḥ as part of the 2nd participle phrase.
VI.50.8–10: These three vss. contain a series of perfect optatives, jagamyāt (8b),
vavṛtyāt (9b), jagmyātam (10a), but they do not show any peculiarities of register or
usage. The connection among the vss. is also signaled by utá, which opens the
second two. Klein (DGRV I.424) notes the co-occurrence of the “optative series” (he
does not mention that they are belong to the pf.) and the utá’s.</p>
<h3 id="vi508">VI.50.8</h3>
<p>With Ge and Re, I take the simile uṣáso ná prátīkam as a nominative phrase,
matching the subject Savitar. Since the dakṣiṇās are distributed at dawn and Dawn is
therefore associated with munificence, her face (= her light) can be characterized as a
discloser of valuables. However, it would also be grammatically possible to take it as
acc., with Savitar disclosing valuables as if disclosing the face of Dawn, though I
think this less likely.</p>
<h3 id="vi509">VI.50.9</h3>
<p>“within (the sphere of)” is an attempt to render the loc. rātaú, since “Might I
always be in your giving” is hard to parse. Klein’s (DGRV I.422) “Might I be ever
(present) at thy giving” is more elegant. I might emend the publ. tr. to “Might I
always be (there) at your giving.”</p>
<h3 id="vi5010">VI.50.10</h3>
<p>This vs. poses several syntactic problems. In ab the position of aṅgá speaks
against taking the full hemistich as a single cl. (so, more or less, Klein DGRV I.422).
Since aṅgá otherwise invariably takes 2nd position, it should not be found this deep in
the clause; moreover the immediately preceding personal prn. yuvám, also
encourages an interpr. as a new cl. Both Ge and Re do divide the sequence into two
clauses, but both include dhībhíḥ in the 2nd clause &ndash; which essentially defeats the
purpose of the clause division, since aṅgá is still in the wrong position, just not as
wrong as if the whole thing were one clause. Their solution is understandable
because it could allow them to avoid taking viprā as a predicated vocative. So Re
“car vous êtes (donneurs) de pensées-poétiques, ô inspirés!” with viprā as real voc.
Ge’s interpr. seems to combine the worst of both worlds — including dhībhíḥ in the
2nd cl. despite the position of aṅgá and taking viprā as a predicated voc. (see his n.
10b): “gerade ihr seid redebegabt mit (guten) Gedanken.” My interpr. limits the 2nd
cl. to yuvám aṅgá viprā, which imposes a predicated voc. but honors the position of
the particle.
The second hemistich is even more problematic. The standard tr. interpret the
sequence as a clausal simile / frame construction, with different verbs in the simile
and the frame, (a)mumuktam (simile) … tū́rvatam (frame), and ná marking the first
clause as a simile. Cf., e.g., Klein (DGRV I.422–23) “As ye freed Atri from great
darkness, (so) cause (us) to pass out of difficulty …” (my emphasis). But such
constructions do not exist in the RV among the hundreds and hundreds of examples
59
of similes in that text: similes are only nominal, and if a verb is implicitly part of it, it
is held constant between simile and frame. See my detailed disc. in “Case
Disharmony.” The only possible examples that approach such a clausal construction
are those providing a model and the action to be based upon it, but the very few such
exx. we have involve yáthā … evā́“just as …, even so …” — as in a childbirth spell:
V.78.7 (cf. also 8) yáthā vā́taḥ puṣkaríṇīṃ, samiṅgáyati sarvátaḥ / evā́te gárbha
ejatu “As the wind sways a lotus-pond in every direction, so let your unborn child
stir.” These conditions are not met here, and I think it a methodologically dangerous
practice to posit an entirely unprecedented construction on the basis of a single
ambiguous passage.
The way to a solution begins with the first verb, which is realized as
amumuktam in the Pp. The only evidence for the augment is the avagraha in the
printed Saṃhitā text(s): ’mumuktam; the sandhi conditions do not require the
augment. In fact Gr lists the form as unaugmented, and Old gets it right (in my view)
the first time: “wie den Atri von der grossen Finsternis, (so) löset (mich &hellip;).” But he
then, unfortunately, has second thoughts, and although he recognizes that “ná nicht
Satzvergleichungspartikel ist,” he decides that ná can sometimes overstep its
boundaries and function like a clausal simile marker (not his term). The single ex. he
cites (VII.58.3), however, does not show what he claims it shows, at least in my
opinion, and it is also not like our passage, in that even by his interpr. the two clauses
would have the same verb (in diff. mood and voice: ví tirāti, … prá … tireta).
Whether Ge, Re, and/or Klein were influenced by Old’s arguments or not, they all
follow the clausal interpr., which I hope I have shown is unacceptable.
My own interpr. is identical to Old’s first pass, with impv. mumuktam and a
supplied ‘me’ as obj., parallel to átrim in the simile. As for the second verb, I follow
Gotō (1st Kl., 163 n. 258) in taking tū́rvataṃ narā as a parenthetical clause. This
allows the abl. phrase at the end of d, duritā́d abhī́ke “from difficulty at close
quarters,” to be construed with mumuktam, parallel to the abl. mahás támasaḥ “from
great darkness” in the simile. However, if the parenthetical interpr. seems too
awkward, it might be possible to take d as a single, separate cl.: “be victorious from
difficulty at close quarters,” though tūrv seems not to take an abl. elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="vi5011">VI.50.11</h3>
<p>The only problems in this vs. are found in pāda d: the accented verb mṛḷátā
and the immediately following ca: the verb because there is no obvious reason for its
accent, the ca because it’s not clear what it conjoins. To begin with the second, Klein
(DGRV I.82), flg. Ge, takes ca as conjoining the impv. mṛḷátā with the pres. part.
daśasyántaḥ beginning c, assuming an implicit imperatival expression daśasyántaḥ
*sta “seid gefällig und erbarmet euch” / “(be) favoring and have mercy.” Re, by
contrast, seems to assume that the ca conjoins the last in the series of nom. pl., divyā́ḥ
pā́rthivaso, gójātā ápyāḥ, judging by his “… et (vous enfin) nés des eaux,” though
this would require an unprecedented displacement of ca to the right, with the verb
inserted between the last nominal term and the ca. Between these two ad hoc
solutions, the first seems distinctly better than the 2nd. To register it, I should perhaps
60
emend the tr. to “(Be ones) showing favor … and be merciful,” despite the
clunkiness.
The verbal accent is &ndash; or may be &ndash; less of a problem. If we do assume that
the daśasyántaḥ stands for an imperatival clause, then mṛḷátā would begin a new
clause. Although neither Ge nor Klein mentions the accent on the verb, it would be
an argument in favor of their analysis. However, if we take the participle simply as
the participle it appears to be, then it modifies the implicit subject of mṛḷátā and the
verb should not be accented. There could be another way to get the accent in that
case, though it seems artificial (or rather, even more artificial than the other
suggestion). The sequence of four nom. pl. noted above is divided across two pādas,
as shown by the comma in the quoted sequence. Only the first two have to be
nominatives rather than vocatives: divyā́ḥ because of its non-initial accent,
pā́rthivāsaḥ because it is accented in the middle of a pāda. The following two, the
first two words of d, could be vocatives, accented because they are initial in the pāda.
They would then match the undoubted voc. devāḥ at the end of the same pāda. If
gójātā ápyāḥ are vocatives, then the immediately following word mṛḷátā would need
to be accented after these extra-sentential elements. However, this analysis requires
the unappealing step of assuming an unsignaled change of case from nominative to
vocative in the middle of an apparently unitary sequence.
After all this syntactic fuss, we may overlook the interesting question, who
are the “cow-born” gods (who appear elsewhere, in similar sequence [VII.52.14, cf.
also X.53.5]). Quite possibly the Maruts, an offhand suggestion of Re’s. Remember
their cow-mother Pṛśni.</p>

<p>On the phrase máma tásya as a probable play on the PN Mamatā̆, see

The phrase vásavo ádhṛṣṭāḥ returns from 4b, where it refers to the Maruts
(unless, with Ge and Re we take vásavaḥ there, and here, as referring to a separate
group, the Vasus). There it was immediately preceded by hūtā́saḥ ‘invoked’, here by
hutā́saḥ ‘offered to’, an understated but clever variation. In this context, the final
totalizing vs. of the hymn, the “unassailable good ones” should probably refer to all
the gods, in a gender-inclusive pairing with the gnā́ḥ ‘(divine) ladies’ &ndash; an unusual
bow to the female side.
VI.51 All Gods
For the structure of this hymn (or, rather, composite of two hymns), see publ.
intro.
61</p>
<h3 id="vi511">VI.51.1</h3>
<p>The full realization of the dual dvandva mitrā́-váruṇā- as two independent
dual genitives separated by a pāda-break and several words &ndash; mitráyoḥ … váruṇayoḥ
&ndash; is a fine demonstration of the reality of this type of cmpd. in the Sprachgefühl.
I do not understand the pāda-final ā́(m̐). Generally in this position ā́follows
an abl., reinforcing the meaning “von … her” (see Gr. col. 169), or a loc. But
mitráyoḥ is of course not an abl., and, though it could grammatically be a loc., by
sense it can only be a gen. It seems pleonastic &ndash; perhaps added to allow a Triṣṭubh
cadence.</p>
<h3 id="vi512">VI.51.2</h3>
<p>vidátha- is here not ‘ceremony of division, rite’, but rather ‘division’ itself,
referring to the divisions of the gods. Ge aptly adduces VI.52.15 in the next hymn,
where the gods are born in 3 different localities.
Old strenuously objects to taking sanutár ā́ca as a conjoined phrase of
directional elements (flg. BR), and Re agrees with him. I do not see the problem; ā́is
of course generally a preverb and less commonly an adposition, but in these usages it
is clearly directional/locational, and conjoining it with another such element seems
well within RVic syntactic bounds, even if the other word is more clearly adverbial.
Moreover, neither Old nor Re gives any indication of what to do with ca if it’s not
conjoining the two. I therefore follow Ge (flg. BR) and Klein (DGRV I.63). (The
case of Re is a bit complex: he expresses his objections to the BR view in the notes to
the Viśvedevāḥ hymns in EVP IV, but in the tr. of those same hymns in EVP V he tr.
as a conjoined phrase “au loin et au près.” Either he forgot or he changed his mind.)</p>
<h3 id="vi513">VI.51.3</h3>
<p>The opening of this vs., stuṣé, is identical to the beginning of VI.49 and very
similar to the beginning of VI.50 (huvé), both of which vss. (VI.49.1, VI.50.1)
contain the divine list discussed in the next paragraph.
We have already had occasion to note (comm. ad VI.49.1, 50.1) the
unexpected trio Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, in which Agni substitutes for expected
Aryaman. Here we have a different third member: Aditi, Mitra, Varuṇa (áditim
mitráṃ váruṇam), opening rather than closing the pāda. Of course, as their mother,
Aditi has a closer connection to Mitra and Varuṇa than Agni does, but in fact she is
rarely found in their immediate company: only in the voc. phrase II.27.14 ádite mítra
váruṇotá also pāda-init. and in a larger list of gods in V.46.3. In our passage the
missing Aryaman is added at the beginning of the next pāda (3c), just as he was
added in the pāda (c) immediately following the list in VI.50.1b. Note that in VI.50.1
áditim precedes the trio in the first pāda of the vs. (VI.50.1a).
In pāda a I take maháḥ as an acc. pl., contra the standard tr. (Ge, Re, Scar
291) “herdmen of great truth.” Either is of course grammatically and semantically
possible, but I was influenced by the undoubted acc. pl. maháḥ also referring to the
gods in the next vs. (4b) as well as 9d.
The vaḥ in pāda a is ambig. With the standard tr. (Ge, Re, Scar 291), I take it
as referring to the gods in the 2nd ps. On the other hand, references to the gods have
so far been in the 3rd ps. and will remain so in the next vs.; 2nd ps. address only
appears in vs. 5. So it would be equally possible to take vaḥ as an instance of the
62
common practice of a poet addressing his priestly comrades, “I will praise, for
you/on your behalf, the great herdsmen of truth …” Nothing much hangs on the
difference, nor is there any way to determine which is correct.
Note that ádabdha-dhītīn ‘having undeceivable inspired thoughts’ at the end
of c echoes áditim beginning b, despite the differences in lexicon and even
segmentation. It also is responsive with ṛtá-dhītayaḥ ‘having truth as inspired
thoughts’ in 10d, and the two form part of the ring around the omphalos vss. 6–7.
While ádabdha- is taken up by ádabdhān in 4a.
For sadhanyàḥ I now favor the scenario sketched by Scar (291) as an
alternative to the analysis as belonging to a root noun cmpd. sadha-nī́-. See comm.
ad IV.1.9. As noted there, Scar begins with a sa-dhána- ‘common wealth’ to which a
*sadhaní- ‘sharer in common wealth’ à ‘companion’ could be formed. He then
suggests that because of a perceived connection with √nī, the stem was reinterpreted
and reformed as sadhanī́-. Although this requires more machinery than simply taking
it as a root noun cmpd. to √nī in the first place, the semantics of that supposed cmpd.
are somewhat troublesome; moreover the stem sadhanitvá- can be more easily
derived by this route. MLW alternatively suggests that the stem is a vṛkī deriv. to
sadhána-. This would account for the morphology more easily that what was just
sketched; however, it would have to be masc. vṛkī form. Not impossible of course
(cf. rathī́-), but one more required assumption.</p>
<h3 id="vi514">VI.51.4</h3>
<p>I follow Ge (as well as Th Fremdling, Oberlies I.344, etc.) in rendering
suvasaná- as ‘good dwelling’, against some potentially good arguments to the
contrary. The stem is attested only once elsewhere, IX.97.50 in the phrase vástrā
suvasanā́ni, where it clearly refers to good garments (√vas ‘wear, clothe’), and the
base of our cmpd, vásana- (a hapax), likewise only means clothing. Citing these
words, as well as vastra-dā́- ‘giving garments’ (V.42.8; like our phrase suvasanásya
dātṝ́n), Re holds firm to “donateurs de bonne vêture” (so also Gr). But sátpatīn ‘lords
of settlements’ in the preceding pāda supports a ‘dwelling’ interpr., and it would be
easy to form such a deriv. to the well-attested root √vas ‘dwell’. (Note that the
derivatives that would support the ‘clothing’ sense are found in that sense only once
apiece, so do not seem well established enough to block such a formation.)
Ge construes diváḥ with nṝ́n and take kṣáyataḥ absolutely: “die mächtigen
Herrn des Himmels.” As in vs. 2, Re seems to have changed his mind (a phenomenon
I know well; witness this comm.) between the comm. fascicle (EVP IV) and the tr.
fascicle (EVP V): in the former he comments of kṣáyataḥ “emploi absolu,” but in the
latter tr. “seigneurs résidants du ciel,” with diváḥ dependent on the participle. He
evidently assigns the participle to ‘dwell’, though the participle of the root pres. to
that root is only kṣiyánt-, while kṣáyant- belongs to kṣáya- ‘rule over’. (Curiously he
correctly interpr. the finite kṣáyatha in 7c as “vous régnez.”) Ge (etc.) must base their
interpr. on the existence of the phrase divó náraḥ / nṝ́n, but though this collocation is
attested elsewhere (e.g., V.54.10, VI.2.3, VI.2.11=14.6), it is not a particularly
common expression, and √kṣi ‘rule over’ regularly takes a genitive, incl. in 7c
víśvasya hí kṣáyatha “for you rule over all,” a phrase Re in fact cites in his comm.
63</p>
<h3 id="vi515">VI.51.5</h3>
<p>This vs. consists primarily of a string of vocatives, plus a couple of 2nd pl.
impvs., so in one way it is quite straightforward. However, the accentual behavior of
the vs., and particularly the vocc., is peculiar. The first pāda consists only of
vocatives: two double names (Father Heaven, Mother Earth) and a single adjective
(by word order belonging to the latter, but it is a root noun cmpd and its voc. is
indifferent to gender). Each word in the pāda is accented (with voc. accent): dyaùṣ
pítaḥ pṛ́thivi mā́tar ádhruk. The first three words of the next pāda are likewise
vocatives: a name plus epithet and a different (pl.) name. Only the first of these is
accented: ágne bhrātar vasavaḥ. The next word is an impv. mṛḷátā, and it is accented
after the extrasentential voc. phrase (cf. comm. ad VI.50.11, where this was floated
as a possibility to explain an unusually accented verb [the same verb in fact], though
rejected). The third pāda also begins with three vocatives, one a two-word phrase,
one an individual name, with only the first accented: víśva ādityā adite. I am
completely puzzled as to why the first pāda differs from the next two. Old is also
puzzled: “Behandlung der Vokativakzente befremdet, aber wir haben kein Recht zu
rühren.”
The content of the vs. is otherwise banal. As Re points out, víśva ādityāḥ is a
stand-in for víśve devāḥ.</p>
<h3 id="vi516">VI.51.6</h3>
<p>Pāda d must remain in the domain of hí in c, as shown by the accent on
babhūvá, as is recognized by the standard tr.
The repetition of yūyám at the beginning of d is, I think, due not only to
rhetoric but to the desire to make the ps./no. of babhūvá perfectly clear. The 2nd pl.
act. pf. is surely the least well attested form of the act. perfect system (save for 1st
du.), and it also has a highly under-characterized ending (-a), which has the
misfortune to be identical to the ending of the best attested form in the pf. system, the
3rd sg., as well as the less well attested 1st sg. (For the relative strengths of attestation,
a glance at Macdonell’s Vedic Grammar §485 will suffice.) In most pf. paradigms it
would be distinguished from those forms by ablaut grade (e.g., 1st sg. cakára, 3rd sg.
cakā́ra, 2nd pl. cakrá), but here, because the pf. of √bhū doesn&rsquo;t ablaut, only the
accent separates it from 3rd (and 1st) sg. babhū́va. This may be another reason that it
was kept syntactically in the realm of hí, to require it to have an accent. It’s worth
noting that this is the only 2nd pl. pf. to √bhū in the RV.
dákṣa- is ordinarily a noun, ‘skill’, but in the publ. tr. I was persuaded by the
standard tr. to render it as an adj. ‘skillful’ with vácas-. This phrase also occurs in
VIII.86.1 and, with a different derivative of √vac, in X.113.9 dákṣebhir vacanébhiḥ.
In the latter I tr. as an adj. “with skillful words,” but in the former as two independent
nouns “of skill and of speech.” I am uncertain which is correct. Re is quite stern:
“dákṣa- est nécessairement adjectif ici et en plusieurs passages …: inutile de
chercher à éviter ici l’emploi, avec Gr., emploi qui est le seul subsistant en skt cl.”
The Classical Skt. usage is suggestive, but I am wary of the absolutist language of
“nécessairement” and “inutile”: very few things in RVic interpr. are absolutely
necessary. I would therefore allow an alt. tr. here: “you have become (the
64
charioteers) of (our) skill and speech.” That vs. 9 contains a cmpd. containing the
noun, pūtá-dakṣa- ‘of refined skill’, though modifying the gods, might support a
‘skill’ interpr. here, esp. as the ‘charioteer’ motif is found there as well.</p>

<p>On apparently anomalous mā́… bhujema see comm. ad IV.3.13.
Re points out the rarity of the cmpd. viśvádeva- in the pl. referring to the All
Gods (though to his X.125.1 should be added VII.35.11). At least in our passage the
full voc. viśve devāḥ would produce a bad cadence.</p>
<h3 id="vi518">VI.51.8</h3>
<p>In this deliberately repetitive vs. (6 occurrences of námas-), it is difficult to
render the repeated verbs ā́vivase (a, d) in the same way. As the desid. to √van,
vivāsa-, esp. with ā́, means lit. ‘seek to win here’, hence ‘attract’, which is fine in
pāda a. But with the object “committed offense” (kṛtám énaḥ) the sense is harder to
manipulate. I take it as ‘win back’, hence ‘redeem’; Ge ‘abbitten’ (beg pardon,
apologize), with no attempt to connect this tr. to the literal meaning or to the other
occurrence of the verb in the passage; Re makes good use of his usual parentheses:
“je l’attire (pour le détruire),” which evades the problem.</p>
<h3 id="vi519">VI.51.9</h3>
<p>This vs. recalls the námas- vs. (8), with its two occurrences of ā́vivase, one
of which is construed with instr. námasā. Here we have the verb form ā́name, which
imitates ā́vivase in preverb and med. 1st sg. form, but with the verbal root from
which námas- is derived, √nam ‘bow, bend’. It also is construed with an instr. of the
s-stem, námobhiḥ.</p>
<h3 id="vi5110">VI.51.10</h3>
<p>Judging from the repeated té and the u that follows the 2nd one (strikingly
in the middle of a pāda), we should be dealing with two parallel clauses, one
nominal, one verbal. The accent on náyanti shows that the 2nd clause is in the domain
of the hí in pāda a. Ge renders as two clauses, but does not seem to keep the 2nd in the
hí domain; Re ignores the té u and tr. as a single clause. There does not appear to be
a main clause in the vs., unless we want to construe cd as a nominal main cl. (“they
are of good rule …”).
sukṣatrá- reprises the same word in 4c, and as noted ad vs. 3, ṛtá-dhītimatches ádabdha-dhīti in 3c. The two are part of the supportive ring around the
omphalos vss. 6–7.
Once again we meet the trio Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni (see comm. on vs. 3, and
previous vss. noted there), but Aryaman is nowhere in the vicinity and Aditi only in a
rather random list in the next vs. (11).
Consonant with the focus on truth in this hymn, pāda d is framed by the words
ṛtá- and satyá-, the former as first member of a cmpd, the latter as last member. As
was just noted, ṛtá-dhīti- is a well-formed bahuvrīhi with a parallel already in the
hymn. But vakma-rā́ja-satya- is distinctly peculiar. For one thing, it has three
members, which is unusual for the RV. But more striking is the final member satya-,
whose relation to the prior (complex) member vakma-rā́ja(n)- is unclear. (Curiously,
AiG doesn’t touch this cmpd.) Its only possible parallel is the even stranger ṛtá-jāta-
65
satya-, with both ṛtá- and satyá-, in IV.51.7 (see comm. ad loc.). Gr glosses “dem
Lenker der Gebete treu oder willfährig.” Ge treats as two separate words “&lsquo;die
beredten Könige, die wahrhaften,” without commenting on this disjunction (or does
he think it’s a dvandva?), though he cites Sāy. as interpr. “wahrhaftig gegen die
Herren der Rede d.h. die Sänger,” which is also reflected in Gr.’s gloss. Old’s “in
Wahrheit Könige der Rede” and Re’s “qui sont vraiment les rois de la parole
(sacrale)” are in essential agreement, and the publ. tr. follows them &ndash; though I feel as
though we’re all missing something.</p>
<h3 id="vi5111">VI.51.11</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. seems to suggest an etymological relationship between
“earthly realm” and “Earth,” but in fact they are lexically distinct: kṣā́ma and pṛthivī́,
though adjacent.
The list of strengtheners in ab is oddly assorted, but up till the last term they
are all divinities or (pṛthivī́) capable of being so configured; I therefore don’t
understand the presence of the “five peoples” (páñca jánāḥ), who are humans. Ge’s
ref. to X.53.4 is no help (at least to me).
Both Ge and Re take the injunc. vardhan as modal “may they / let them
strengthen.” Certainly the impv. bhávantu in the 2nd hemistich would support this
interpr., but in general modal readings of injunctives are rather rare.
The 2nd hemistich contains 5 cmpds with su- as first member, all but the last
bahuvrīhis, as Re points out. The odd-man-out is sugopā́ḥ ‘good herdmen’. All 5
have accent on the 2nd member.</p>
<h3 id="vi5112">VI.51.12</h3>
<p>As disc. in the publ. intro., this is the final vs. of the first hymn in this
composite group and as such summarizes the just-concluded hymn and asks for
divine favor, naming the poet, or rather his family.
The grammatical identity and the use of náṃśi is uncertain. Gr labels it as an
aor. (also Wh Rts), 1st sg. middle, and this interpr. is reflected in Ge’s and Re’s tr. &ndash;
though both add a modal feature (“möchte ich …,” “je voudrais …”) that would
again be somewhat unusual for an injunctive. Lub also groups it with the root aor.
and calls it an injunc. but with ? (By contrast Hoffmann won’t commit to an analysis
[219].) In one sense a finite aor. is the most likely interpr., but if so, we must explain
the accent on what appears to be a non-initial main-clause verb. The hemistich would
also switch from 1st ps. in this pāda to 3rd ps. in the rest of the vs. (bhā́radvājaḥ …
yāti …), and though RVic discourse is certainly capable of that, it’s one more
anomaly. The publ. tr. follows Old’s preference for Ludwig’s interpr. of the form as
an infinitive. In either case (finite form or infin.) it is, as Old says, “auffallend
gebildet.” I take it as a loc. inf. with a purpose function, though I realize that this is
ad hoc.
In the context of later śrauta ritual, the application of hotā́and yájamānaḥ to
the same individual would be strange. But the ritual roles so distinct in middle Vedic
śrauta texts are by no means clearly parceled out in the RV, and in particular
yájamāna- does not usually identify a particular ritual role but acts as an attributive
participle, as I think it does here.
66
VI.15.13–15: As noted in the publ. intro., I consider the remaining vss. to belong to a
different hymn (or hymns?), appended to the unified, well-structured hymn found in
vss. 1–12. Vss. 13–15 are unified by their meter, including an unusual variant of
Uṣṇih with the configuration 8 8 / 8 4; see disc. ad vs. 13. Whether vs. 16, in
Anuṣṭubh, belongs to this set or was independently appended I don’t know, but it
certainly has a “final” feel to it.</p>
<h3 id="vi5113">VI.51.13</h3>
<p>This first vs. of the extra material has various lexical ties to the first hymn:
vṛjinám: 2c vṛjinā́; satpate: 4a sátpatīn; ripúm: 7d ripúḥ, which might help explain
why it (and the following two vss.) were attached here.
Ge attaches daviṣṭhám asya satpate to ab and begins a new cl. with kṛdhī́:
“Schaffe gute Fahrt.” I assume that one of his motivations is the accent on kṛdhī́,
which appears to be in the middle of a pāda. And he may feel that making “easy
passage” (sugám) for a criminal would be contrary to expectation. However, he
seems to ignore the asya &ndash; at least I find nothing in his tr. that corresponds to it. The
accentual problem can be easily resolved: the three vss. 13–15 seem to have an 8 8 /
8 4 structure, rather than 8 8 / 12. On this analysis of the meter, kṛdhī́starts a new
pāda and should be accented. In vs. 14 vṛ́ko hí ṣáḥ is a new clause and nicely fits a
separate pāda, and in vs. 15 gopā́amā́is also syntactically separate.
Vs. 15 also supports my interpr. in another way: kártā naḥ … sugám “make
good passage for us” is syntactically parallel to my interpr. of 13 … asya … kṛdhī́
sugám “make good passage for him,” with naḥ corresponding to asya. As for making
good passage for a criminal, the point is to get him as far away as fast as possible,
and good passage will accomplish this faster than bad.
(Re’s interpr. is overly complex; though he does find space for the asya, he
does not deal with the accented verb. I won’t treat it further here.)</p>
<h3 id="vi5114">VI.51.14</h3>
<p>The unusual position of hí, normally a 2nd position element, is due to
immediately following kam. For whatever reason (and I don’t know it), hí kam is a
phrasal unit, whether it occurs in expected 2nd position (I.98.1, II.28.8, VIII.11.10) or
not (VIII.44.24, IX.49.4, X.100.5). II.37.5 may provide a transition between the two,
since the hí kam sequence is not pāda-initial there, but it is in 2nd position in its
clause.
The standard treatments (Gr, Ge, Re) take vāvaśúḥ to √vaś ‘wish for’, but Kü
(477–80) has argued persuasively that morphological factors favor instead a
connection with √vāś ‘bellow’ &ndash; though he allows for a secondary contamination
from the former root for a sense “sehnsüchtig brüllen.” I am in complete agreement.
The most salient feature of the pressing stones is their noise, and so bellowing for
Soma’s companionship like the bovines that are the usual subjects of √vāś makes
perfect sense.
See comm. ad vs. 13 for the four-syllable pāda consisting of the nominal
sentence vṛ́ko hí ṣáḥ. As I argued in my 2009 “Function of Animals in the RV” (Paris
animal vol., 206–9, esp. 208), the wolf is a cross-category in RVic classification, and
67
this statement is a quasi-legal declaration that a particular human evil-doer is an
outlaw &ndash; with parallels in other early Indo-European traditions.</p>
<h3 id="vi5115">VI.51.15</h3>
<p>In the second hemistich ádhvan ‘on the road’ and amā́‘at home’ are
contrastive, as Re points out. The brief tag gopā́amā́must be a separate clause: both
Ge and Re supply an imperatival “be,” as do I. Again clausal division supports the
metrical division suggested ad vs. 13.</p>
<h3 id="vi5116">VI.51.16</h3>
<p>One possible arg. for taking vs. 16 with the three that precede, despite their
metrical difference, is that s
u
vastigā́m in b is reminiscent of sugám in 13d and could
form a little ring. But I’m not at all certain this is sufficient.
VI.52 All Gods
For the structure of the hymn, see publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="vi521">VI.52.1</h3>
<p>The instr. of ab, in two semantic sets &ndash; Heaven and Earth, sacrifice and
ritual labors &ndash; apparently are the entities that the speaker swears by.
The vs., at least its 2nd hemistich, has a slangy feel &ndash; with the unusual
phonology of the root √ubj ‘crush’ and the lexeme ní √hā ‘be bent double’ (in my
rendering), found elsewhere only in a curse in the Anhangslied VII.104.10.
The agent noun yaṣṭár- seems like a potential candidate for the role of
technical term for ‘Sacrificer’, which was rejected in favor of yájamāna-.
VI.52.1–2: It is unfortunately impossible to capture in Engl. the play between ánu
√man ‘concede’ (1a) and áti √man ‘disdain’ (2a), with the further echo of áti in
atiyā́já- (1d).</p>
<h3 id="vi522">VI.52.2</h3>
<p>nínitsāt is an unusual formation: a subjunctive to a desiderative. It may lend
immediacy to the action, which is to be taken against a formulation that is being
performed (note the pres. part. kriyámāṇam).
Old, Ge, and Re all take vṛjinā́ni as a nominalized adjective (“seine
Falschheiten,” etc.), modified by or identified with tápūṃṣi (e.g., Ge “dem mögen
seine Falschheiten zu Feuerflammen werden”), rather than simply as an adjective. It
would be possible to tr. it adjectivally (“for him let there be twisting, scorching
[flames]”). In the publ. tr. I chose to render vṛjinā́ni both ways, as a nominalized adj.
(‘twisted [ways]’) and as an adj. ‘twisting’ characterizing the flames. In this way the
punishment fits the crime. Note that vṛjiná- was used twice in the preceding hymn,
VI.51.2, 13.</p>
<h3 id="vi523">VI.52.3</h3>
<p>Ge (and to a lesser extent Re) takes the repeated kím aṅgá as “why?” But
this seems more insulting to Soma than seems wise if we are urging him to strike our
enemies. I take it rather as marking a series of solemn rhetorical question setting out
the reasons why Soma should come to our aid.
68</p>
<h3 id="vi524">VI.52.4</h3>
<p>Although this vs. begins a new tṛca, it continues the series of pres.
participles that bring a vivid immediacy to the poet’s bids for help: kriyámānam (2b)
‘being performed’, nidyámānam (3c) ‘being scorned’, and here jā́yamānāḥ (4a)
‘being born’, pínvamānāḥ (4b) ‘swelling’. The dhruvā́saḥ ‘steadfast’ in c brings all
this ongoing action to a halt, and deváhūtau breaks the series entirely &ndash; until the next
vss.</p>
<h3 id="vi525">VI.52.5</h3>
<p>Another pres. part. uccárantam ‘rising’.
Ge and Re interpr. devā́n as a truncated gen. pl., which would be esp. unusual
in pāda-initial position (pāda-final being at least arguably more plausible, since
truncation and the adjustment of cadences in different meters are possible factors).
Old seems to take this interpr. as tantamount to a moral lapse (“… scheint mir
Verlassen des geraden Weges”). He takes it as the acc. pl. it appears to be, but
construes it with ā́gamiṣṭhaḥ (“der den Göttern am besten mit Hilfe beispringt”).
Although this is syntactically possible, it is semantically unlikely: Indra, who by the
evidence of the repeated and expanded phrase in 6a is clearly the subject, is most
welcome to come to us; I doubt if we care whether the gods hope for his arrival or
not. My own solution is somewhat dodgy: I take óhānaḥ as a pass. part. ‘being
lauded as’ with the venerable formulaic phrase vásupatir vásūnām “goods-lord of
goods” as the title given by the laud (so far so good), with devā́n a loosely relational
acc., almost an acc. of extent: “(lauded) over/across the (other) gods.” (Ge’s and Re’s
interpr. of vásupatir vásūnām and óhānaḥ vary, and I will not detail them here.)</p>
<h3 id="vi526">VI.52.6</h3>
<p>The part. pínvamānā is repeated from 4b, with a small twist of phraseology:
Sarasvatī swelling with the rivers, rather than the rivers swelling as in 4b.
The syntactic status of the various gods in bcd is unclear. Are they all separate
subjects of ā́gamiṣṭhaḥ (so Re)? Or should we supply other verbs? Ge supplies “sei”
with cd, but keeps b with a, implicitly making Sarasvatī another subj. of ā́gamiṣṭhaḥ.
Or is this just the beginning of an All God list, with no predicates required &ndash; or
feeding into the next tṛca inviting the All Gods to come here?
VI.52.7–12: These two tṛcas (7–9, 10–12) are in Gāyatrī, and the first tṛca esp. is an
elementary production, with almost no tricks (though see vs. 9). One wonders
whether great swaths of RV-period poetry were similarly lackluster and therefore not
generally preserved.</p>
<h3 id="vi529">VI.52.9</h3>
<p>This vs. consists of two 3rd pl. impv. clauses, ab and c. The 2nd is entirely
straightforward, and the first is until the end, where we find a hemistich-final rel.
prn. yé, clearly coreferential with the subj. of the impv. but difficult to construe: úpa
naḥ sūnávo gíraḥ, śṛṇvántu amṛ́tasya yé. The only grammatical way to interpr. this is
as a tag nominal rel. cl. amṛ́tasya yé “who (are) of the immortal one.” But this leaves
the main-cl. subj. sūnávaḥ underdefined: it is not any set of sons that we invite to
hear our hymns, but only the sons of the immortal one. But tag rel. clauses generally
give additional, not necessary, information about their referents in the main clause,
69
and so such an interpr. would leave the sentence oddly unbalanced. We cannot take
the whole hemistich as a rel. cl. (“which sons of the immortal …”), not only because
the rel. prn. would be too deep in its clause, following both subject and VP, but also
because impvs. do not occur in subordinate clauses in the RV. I think we’re dealing
with a poet who knew about tag rel. clauses and wanted to try his hand at one, but
didn’t know how they work. As Ge points out (n. 9ab), the substance of the cl. is
identical to X.13.1 śṛṇvántu víśve amṛ́tasya putrā́ḥ. Given these considerations, I
have not attempted to render the yé &ndash; passing in silence over a journeyman’s lapse.</p>
<h3 id="vi5210">VI.52.10</h3>
<p>The first hemistich here does assay a little figure: ṛtā- ṛtú- across the pāda
boundary.
The use of yújya- in c is not entirely clear to me. I take it to mean that the
offering, the milk (páyaḥ), is ritually associated with the calls (hávana-) the gods are
hearing. Cf. VI.3.8. Ge and Re think that the association is between the substance and
the gods.</p>
<h3 id="vi5211">VI.52.11</h3>
<p>This vs. is essentially parallel to vs. 10: various gods are to enjoy both
verbal and material offerings, with the verb stem juṣá- ‘enjoy’ held constant. Vs. 10
has an impv. juṣántām, but our vs. an injunc. juṣanta. The latter may be a substitute
for the impv. in a metrical situation that favors a light final syl.
VI.52.13–15: I consider these three vss. as a tṛca. They are thematically unified, by
their focus on the gods in general and (esp. vss. 13 and 15) by their classification of
the gods into groups based on their location and type. On the supposed Jagatī meter
of vs. 14, which would not match its tṛca partners, see ad loc.</p>
<h3 id="vi5213">VI.52.13</h3>
<p>The disjunctive pairing yé agnijihvā́utá vā yájatrāḥ is puzzling if we take
the utá vā seriously. Klein’s tr. (DGRV II.168–69) can stand for the standard tr.:
“which ones have Agni as their tongue or are worthy of worship.” Klein considers
this an example of “opposed but nonantonymous terms” giving a “subcategorization
of heavenly ones.” But when so rendered there seems to be no distinction between
the two groups: the general run of gods who are worthy of the sacrifice also receive
those oblations through Agni &ndash; there’s no reason for a vā. I am therefore inclined to
pay attention to the -tra instrument suffix on yájatrāḥ: ‘the instruments or means of
sacrifice’. Such an interpr. divides the set into those who require Agni as
intermediary and those who directly effect the sacrifice. Exactly who the latter might
be, I’m not certain &ndash; perhaps only Soma. If I am correct, yájatra- is used differently
from yajñíya- in the next vs. But see vs. 17 where yájatra- does not seem to have the
instrument sense.</p>
<h3 id="vi5214">VI.52.14</h3>
<p>This vs. is metrically problematic. The Anukr. (also HvN) identifies it as a
Jagatī, but the vs. instead seems mostly to be aiming to be a Triṣṭubh, like the
surrounding (and thematically related) vss. 13 and 15. To begin at the end, d is
simply a standard Triṣṭubh pāda (though with uncommon break): 11 syllables with a
70
fine cadence. The intermediate pādas b and c have 12 syllables (possibly 13 in c), but
a Triṣṭubh cadence, which seems more diagnostic than the syllable count. Old (ad
loc. and ad I.53.10) favors an “überzählig” interpr. for both, in other words as
Triṣṭubhs with an extra syl.; see his disc. in Prol. 67. Only pāda a is an unproblematic
Jagatī, and even here, as Old points out (though he does not favor this analysis), it
might be possible to read the final word yajñíyāḥ as a disyllable, which would again
produce a perfect Triṣṭubh.</p>
<h3 id="vi5216">VI.52.16</h3>
<p>Agni and Parjanya seem an odd couple, and this dual dvandva is found
only here. But recall that the two appear together earlier in the hymn, in vs. 6 (with
Indra and Sarasvatī), and in fact Parjanya is oddly well represented in this set of All
God hymns; cf. the dual dvandva parjányā-vā́tā in VI.49.6, 50.12. In our vs. the two
are given a division of labor, conveyed by the “the one … the other” construction of
c (íḷām anyó janáyad gárbham anyáḥ), but curiously which god is responsible for
which begetting is unclear enough to have produced entirely opposite interpretations.
In his n. 16c Ge, who does not commit himself in his tr., cites Sāy. at length, who
thinks that Parjanya produces the íḷā-, while Agni produces the gárbha-. Re the exact
oppposite: “Que l’un [Agni] engendre l’oblation-liquide, l’autre [Parjanya] le
germe.” Although I think Re is more likely correct, the analysis is by no means
certain. Note, on the one hand, nearby VI.50.12 parjányā-vā́tā pipyatām íṣaṃ naḥ
“Let Parjanya and Vāta swell refreshments for us,” which supports Sāy.’s interpr. On
the other, Parjanya is more regularly associated with rétas- ‘semen’, and one passage
in one of the three hymns dedicated to him, V.83.1, is esp. telling: réto dadhāti
óṣadhīṣu gárbham “He deposits his semen as embryo in the plants,” with the gárbhafound here. The ambiguity is probably meant.
As Ge points out, the two products are reconciled in the last pāda, where both
gods are urged jointly to give us “refreshments accompanied by offspring”
(prajā́vatīr íṣaḥ), with prajā- standing in for gárbha- and íṣ- for íḷā- from pāda c.</p>
<h3 id="vi5217">VI.52.17</h3>
<p>A typical final vs. summarizing the ritual. For yajatrāḥ see comm. ad vs.
13.</p>
<h2 id="vi53-pūṣan">VI.53 Pūṣan</h2>
<p>Although, as noted in the publ. intro., this hymn is remarkably bloodthirsty,
there is also a minor theme focusing on poetry and poetic formulation. The word dhī́-
‘poetic vision’ is found in the first and last vss., shaping a faint ring, as well as in vs.
4. And Pūṣan is called kaví- in vs. 5, and his awl is the ‘impeller of the bráhman-’
(brahma-códanī-) in vs. 8.</p>
<h3 id="vi532">VI.53.2</h3>
<p>This is the only possible passage in the RV in which gṛhápati- ‘houselord’
may refer to a human (as also noted by Oberlies, I.355 n. 99); in all other cases its
referent is Agni. (See my forthcoming “The Term gṛhastha and the (Pre)history of
the Householder.”) The presence of nárya- ‘stemming from men’ and vīrá- ‘hero’
may support a human reading for gṛhápati-; in both cases we seem to be aiming for
71
valuable goods given to us by human patrons, and “a houselord of value” (vāmáṃ
gṛhápatim) would be a third such instance. However, since both nṛ́- and vīrá- can
also refer to gods in the RV, the human element is by no means assured, and the
otherwise exclusive use of gṛhápati- for a god in the RV is telling. If the word does
refer to a human, this may be another indication of the popular character and lower
linguistic register of the Pūṣan hymns, as gṛhápati- does refer to humans in the AV.
DL suggests to me that, though the dominant sense of vāmá- here must be
‘valuable’, there might be a pun on vāmá- (or vā́ma-; see EWA s.v.) ‘left’,
immediately following práyata-dakṣiṇam. The 2nd member of that bahuvrīhi is of
course dákṣiṇā- ‘priestly gift’, but the adj. stem dákṣiṇa- means ‘right (/south)’.
Although vāmá-/vā́ma- ‘left’ is not attested until the ŚB, it could well have been
current in ordinary speech before that, as its presence in MIA (e.g., Pāli vāma-)
suggests. Perhaps another sign of the more demotic lexicon of this hymn.</p>
<h3 id="vi533">VI.53.3</h3>
<p>For some reason Ge always refuses to tr. the standing epithet of Pūṣan,
ā́ghṛṇi-, though he fearlessly takes on far more challenging lexical items. The word
must belong to the inherited root √ghṛ ‘be hot, burn’, etc., found only in nominal
forms in Skt.; see EWA s.vv. ghṛṇá-, gharmá-. Why Pūṣan is glowing, fiery, I don’t
know; perhaps it would be best to adopt Re’s ‘ardent’.
ví mrada is the only verbal form to this root in the RV, and such forms are
quite rare in Vedic (ví mradate MS, mradaya- TS). (For detailed disc. see Gotō 247–
48.) The root is otherwise found in the RV only in the cmpd. ū́rṇa-mradas- ‘soft as
wool, lit. having the softness of wool’ in the funeral hymn X.18.10. I wonder if mrad
belongs to the technical terminology of fabric construction and therefore would fit in
with Pūṣan’s connection to homely, practical activities, as in the words for ‘awl’ (or
whatever ā́rā- is) and the like in this hymn. However, the TS, MS passages don’t
support this speculation.
VI.53.3–4: Note ví mrada (3c), ví mṛ́dhaḥ (4b).
VI.53.5–6: On ā́rā- see EWA s.v. It is difficult to determine exactly what tool it was,
but it seems to have had a sharp point, at least later means ‘awl’, and means ‘awl’ in
cognate languages. In any case it is the sort of utilitarian implement that we would
not expect to find in the hands of, say, Indra, but that is appropriate to the more
down-to-earth handyman Pūṣan. The word is found in Vedic only in this hymn (vss.
5, 6, 8). Re’s ‘lance’ seems entirely too elevated; Ge’s ‘Stachel’ is a better fit.
VI.53.7–8: These vss. contains the delightful phrase ā́rikha kikirā́krṇ̥ u, whose
playful sonic effects I endeavored to capture in my anachronistic tr. The word kikirā
is of course a hapax (though cf. YV kikkiṭā́), and I doubt if a lexical meaning is to be
sought for it.
I do wonder whether the original phrase read *kuru for <em>kṛṇu. The former is,
of course, a late form, belonging to the irregular paradigm karóti, kuruté that will
replace the well-behaved 5th cl. kṛṇóti after the RV. The impv. kuru is found in only
72
two passages in the late RV, but in a colloquial hymn like this it would be at home,
and the phonological patterning would be improved: ā́rikha kikirā́</em>kuru, with CV
syllables containing repeated high vowels and a consonantal r in each word, in
addition to the k’s. This *kuru would have been replaced redactionally by the kṛṇu
standard in RVic discourse on the basis of kṛṇuhi in 10c. Vs. 10 displays a more
formal level of discourse and imitates the final hymn-summary vss. found through
the RV, and the standard RVic form of the pres. of √kṛ is in order there.</p>
<h3 id="vi5310">VI.53.10</h3>
<p>As just noted, this vs. leaves the rough-and-tumble and provides a solemn
and conventional end to the hymn. For a similar sequence of X-sā́- cmpds in a hymnfinal vs., see, e.g., IX.2.10, whose pāda b is identical to pāda b here, save for the case
(nom. vs. acc.). It also, as noted before, ring-compositionally echoes vs. 1 dhiyé with
dhíyam. The dhī́- that we launched in vs. 1 will now (we pray) be crowned with
goods.
The first hemistich nicely begins and ends with utá, though the two have
different functions—the first as interstanzaic conjunction (Klein DGRV I.401) and
the other conjoining the acc. obj. nouns in series (ibid. 351–52).</p>
<h2 id="vi54-pūṣan">VI.54 Pūṣan</h2>
<p>A remarkably unproblematic hymn on the whole.</p>
<h3 id="vi547">VI.54.7</h3>
<p>The sequence mā́kiḥ … mā́kīm … mā́kim, each followed by an injunctive in
prohibitive sense, is remarkable, in that all three can be read (and are read by me,
seemingly also Ge: “keines … keines … keines …”) as expressing the same
(negated) subject of the verbs &ndash; but only -kiḥ has a nominative “look.” It would be
possible, with Gr, to take mā́kīm as ‘nimmer, nicht’, as against mā́kis ‘niemand,
keiner’, but the sing-song parallelism of the passage invites the two forms to be
interpr. identically. (A Gr-inspired interpr. should yield “let none disappear; let it
never be harmed …, etc.”) Re claims that mā́kis is personal (“puisse aucun(e)”) while
mā́kim is impersonal (“puisse rien” or “… jamais”) &ndash; the latter (“jamais”) is of
course Gr’s position, the former (“rien”) seems hard to maintain in this passage,
where surely the subjects of the verbs are all the same, namely the cow that is our
concern in this part of the hymn. I think we must reckon with a morphological
extension even greater than that found in the free-standing particles sīm and īm.
Those two stand for all numbers and genders, but always have accusative function.
(See my 2002 Fs. Cardona “RVic sim and īm.”) Here, perhaps by way of the
adverbial-type readings favored by Gr and Re (see VIII.45.23), -kīm has lost all
distinctive case function and can be used as a nominative.

In c I take rāyáḥ as a morphological pun, both gen. sg. with ī́śānam and acc.
pl. with īmahe. See a more complex example in the next hymn VI.55.2, as well as
VIII.26.22, 46.6, 53.1 for the identical pāda with identical interpr.</p>
<h3 id="vi5410">VI.54.10</h3>
<p>The first two pādas are marked by alliteration: pári pūṣā́parástād, dhástaṃ
dadhātu dákṣiṇam. The sandhi-induced dh of dhástam (for underlying hástam) is esp.
nice.</p>
<h2 id="vi55-pūṣan">VI.55 Pūṣan</h2>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the hymn is structured by an ever-shifting lexical
chain. The links are as follows: vs. 1 rathī́ḥ &ndash; 2 rathī́tamam / 2 rāyáḥ sákhā́yam &ndash; 3
rāyáḥ &hellip; sákhā / 3 ajāśva &ndash; 4 ajā́śvam / 4 svásur &hellip; jāráḥ &ndash; 5 svásur jāráh. For the
last vs. which lacks a precise repetition, note bhrā́tā in 5 phonologically echoed by
bíbhrataḥ ending 6, although they are of course lexically unrelated. We might also
note that the verb in 1b, sacāvahai ‘let us two accompany each other’, is echoed by
the ‘companion’ word sákhi- in vss. 2, 3, and 5, and ajá- ‘goat’, found in the cmpd.
ajā́śva- ‘having goats as horses’ of vss. 3–4, reappears in 6 without the horses.</p>
<h3 id="vi551">VI.55.1</h3>
<p>The tonic 1st dual nominative prn. vā́m ‘we two’ is a hapax &ndash; the only
occurrence of this distinct nominative in all of Sanskrit, replaced post-RV by āvám.
See AiG III.465–66. It opens its clause, but because it follows the vs.-initial impv.
éhi, it appears to be in 2nd position. Is it an accident that this is where the extremely
well-attested enclitic dual 2nd ps. vām is ordinarily found?</p>
<h3 id="vi552">VI.55.2</h3>
<p>As noted ad VI.54.8 above, this vs. contains a more complex variant of
ī́śānaṃ rāyá īmahe in VI.54.8c. There I interpr. rāyáḥ as both a gen. sg. with ī́śānam
and an acc. pl. with īmahe. In our vs. here, ī́śānam is found in pāda b with an
undoubted gen. phrase rā́dhaso maháḥ, while in pāda c rāyó sákhāyam īmahe we
again find a rāyáḥ that is both gen. sg. (with sákhāyam) and acc. pl. (again with
īmahe). This complex seems like a partial “repair” of 54.8, since it makes clear that
ī́śānam takes the gen., which in turn suggests that rāyáḥ in 54.8 may have that
reading too.</p>
<h3 id="vi553">VI.55.3</h3>
<p>The āmreḍita dhī́vato-dhīvataḥ ‘of every visionary’ recalls the focus on dhī́-
in the nearby hymn (VI.53.1, 4, 10).
VI.55.4–5: As noted in the publ. intro., these allusions to incest seem remarkably
matter-of-fact. The vss. seem to focus more on the kinship relations — sister,
mother, brother, comrade — than any potential violation of them.</p>
<h3 id="vi555">VI.55.5</h3>
<p>Ge interpr. abravam to mean “I have spoken of” (“(Von Pūṣan) … habe ich
gesprochen”), but the fact that we immediately urge him to hear us suggests that we
have spoken to him. In the next hymn VI.56.4 … tvā … brávāma also clearly means
“we speak/say to you.”
74</p>
<h3 id="vi556">VI.55.6</h3>
<p>This vs. presents several problems, both located in pāda b: the hapax
niśṛmbhā́ḥ and the highly unusual position of the accented 3rd ps. pl. prn. té.
To tackle the first issue first, I am generally persuaded by Berger’s 1966
explan. of the Skt. śrambh forms as hypersanskritizations of MIA vissaddha, etc., in
his view itself a cross of Skt. viśvasta- and śraddhā. See EWA s.v. ŚRAMBH and esp.
KEWA s.v. śrámbhate. My ‘trusty’ reflects this possible connection with śraddhā-
‘trust’.
The position of té is highly unusual; this pronominal stem overwhelmingly
takes init. (or modified init.) position in its clause. When it does not, it is usually
adjacent to the verb or has some other obvious reason for its placement. Here it
seems dropped in randomly. I therefore propose to read *tejana-śríyam, with téjana-
‘sharp point’ found once elsewhere in the RV and also thereafter. The only alteration
of the Saṃhitā text this requires is dropping the accent on té. Here téjana- would
refer to the goad or awl that Pūṣan wields (see, e.g. VI.53.5–6, 9). In the publ. tr. I
made use of Narten’s understanding of -śrī́- in such cmpds as meaning
“vollkommendmachen”: see her KlSch. 352 n. 19 for the transmitted reading of this
cmpd jana-śrī́- rendered as ‘die Menschen … vollkommenmachend’ &ndash; though I took
*tejana- as instr.: ‘who brings (all) to readiness *with his sharp (goad)’. But I now
prefer a different value for -śrī́- ‘splendid with his sharp (goad)’ vel sim., more in
keeping with my interpr. of other -śrī́- cmpds like ghṛta-śrī́- ‘splendid with ghee’.
On the multiple semantic possibilities of -śrī́- cmpds see Scar (544–54); on this cmpd
in particular, Scar (551): my interpr. is basically his choice B (though of course with
jana- rather than tejana- as 1st member).</p>
<h2 id="vi56-pūṣan">VI.56 Pūṣan</h2>
<h3 id="vi561">VI.56.1</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. tr., there is difference of opinion about the purport of
pāda c ná téna devá ādíśe. Ge thinks it’s a positive expression (n. 1c): Pūṣan likes
porridge so much that he’ll come without being asked twice. Re thinks it’s more
ambiguous: for him the idiom ā́√diś means ‘target’ (viser), incl. by evil speech or
the like, hence ‘menace’ &ndash; here, targeting Puṣan with the epithet means that he
doesn’t have to be targeted “réellement.” (Klein’s [DGRV I.420] I just don’t
understand: “by that one is the heavenly one not to be so designated.” Does he think
that in using that nickname the human is being too familiar with the god?) I find Re’s
interpr. simply puzzling, but, though Ge’s is more persuasive, I think the point is
rather that the epithet is a unique designation that picks out Pūṣan once and for all.
The usage of ā́√diś in nearby VI.48.14 is similar; see disc. there. See also VI.57.2
below. MLW adds arguments supporting my interpr.: “In Vedic prose ā́√diś is used
to refer to the specification of which god gets which offering and I think this may be
an old old meaning of this verb with parallels in Umbrian.”
VI.56.2–3: There is general consensus (Ge, Re, Klein loc. cit.) that Indra is the
subject of both of these vss., with Pūṣan appearing only as the instr. companion in
75
2b. By contrast, I consider Pūṣan the “best charioteer” (rathī́tamaḥ in 2a and 3c),
because in the immediately preceding hymn rathī́- (VI.55.1c), rathī́tama- (VI.55.2a)
are unequivocally used of Pūṣan. My interpr. requires that the subject change from
2a to 2bc, where Indra is indeed the subject, but see the anyáḥ … anyáḥ construction
in the next hymn (VI.57.2, cf. 3) where the two gods each appear contrastively in the
nominative. This interpr. also has the advantage that Pūṣan doesn’t disappear in the
middle of his own hymn.</p>
<h3 id="vi562">VI.56.2</h3>
<p>Pāda c is essentially identical to VI.57.3 in the next hymn, but there Indra’s
two fallow bay horses are Indra’s companions when he smashes obstacles.</p>
<h3 id="vi563">VI.56.3</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the content of this vs. is quite baffling, though
the syntax and, for the most part, the lexicon are not. Ge (n. 3) pronounces it a
“dunkler Sagenzug,” and I can only agree. I have argued that it is connected with the
even more baffling VI.48.17 (see comm. there) and that these two passages associate
Pūṣan with the “tearing off the Sun’s wheel” myth that remains tantalizingly out of
our reach. But this must remain speculation.
The paruṣé gávi tr., “in ‘the gray cow’,” is of course masc., so should perhaps
be “gray bull,” though I meant cow=bovine. The phrase is reminiscent of V.27.5
paruṣā́ḥ … ukṣánaḥ “gray bulls/oxen,” but that phrase is in a dānastuti and does not
help us with the metaphor here. For another possible – if extremely tenuous –
connection see comm. ad X.5.5.</p>
<h3 id="vi564">VI.56.4</h3>
<p>Since Pūṣan is the god who sends the cows home and watches over paths
and journeys in general, it is entirely appropriate that he should “make [various
objects] reach their goal” (sādhaya), including our thought. Cf. in the first Pūṣan
hymn of this cycle, VI.53.4 sā́dhantām … no dhíyaḥ “Let our poetic visions reach
their goal.”</p>
<h3 id="vi566">VI.56.6</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. implies that both ‘well-being’ (acc. svastím) and ‘wholeness’
(dat. sarvátātaye) are the complements of īmahe ‘we beg’, and in fact I think that is
the intent of the passage, however loose the syntax. But it might be possible to
construe the dat. with ‘well-being’: “we beg you for well-being to completeness,”
i.e., for well-being in its entirety.
VI.57 Pūṣan and Indra</p>
<h3 id="vi572">VI.57.2</h3>
<p>Note the use of ‘porridge’ as an identifying attribute of Pūṣan; this supports
my contention above (ad VI.56.1) that ‘porridge-eater’ is a descriptor that uniquely
identifies Pūṣan.</p>
<h3 id="vi573">VI.57.3</h3>
<p>See VI.56.2 above.</p>
<h3 id="vi574">VI.57.4</h3>
<p>The root noun rít- to √ri ‘flow’ is a hapax.
76</p>
<h3 id="vi575">VI.57.5</h3>
<p>Though apparently straightforward, this vs. is rather oddly constructed, esp.
pāda b. The conjoined NP pūṣṇáh … índrasya ca “of Pūṣan and Indra” is separated
by some distance, though perfectly comprehensible. It is the material that separates
it, pāda b vṛkṣásya prá vayā́m iva, that seems awkward. Particularly odd is the midpāda position of prá, which is far from its verb (if it has a verb; see below) and
breaks up a simile with which is seems unconnected: vṛkṣásya … vayā́m iva “like the
branch of a tree.” In the simile itself iva is wrongly placed (expect *vṛkṣasya-iva
vayā́m). It is also doubtful that prá is in tmesis from the verb (ā́) rabhāmahe, since
prá never otherwise occurs with √rabh, which is very common with ā́. I have no
explanation for either the position or the function of prá. As for the wrong placement
of iva, putting it after the 2nd term of the simile is not altogether rare and is therefore
less puzzling.
All of this may have something to do with the poet’s attempt to set up the play
vayám (a), vayā́m (b), though that play would have been more effective if vayā́m
were pāda-final, not followed by iva.</p>
<h2 id="vi58-pūṣan">VI.58 Pūṣan</h2>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the style and in part the register of this, the only
trimeter hymn in the Pūṣan cycle, is more elevated than the rest. Still, characteristic
lexical items &ndash; ajā́śva- ‘having goats for horses’, áṣṭra- ‘goad &ndash; are found.</p>
<h3 id="vi581">VI.58.1</h3>
<p>It is quite unclear what this vs. is conveying, and my interpr. differs
radically from the standard. Flg. Sāy., both Ge and Re supply rūpám as the referent
for the anyád … anyád construction and further assume that these are two forms of
Pūṣan, namely, in Ge’s words (n. 1ab), “die solare und die gewöhnliche Form des
Pūṣan.” I find this unlikely for two reasons: 1) I know of no evidence for two forms
of Pūṣan, and none is supplied by those who interpr. it thus; 2) there is a perfectly
good neut. referent available for the anyád … anyád construction, namely the two
day-halves (áhanī) in b, whose descriptor víṣurūpe ‘of dissimilar form’ seems meant
to specify the disjunctive choices given in pāda a. (For a similar disjunctive
description of the day-halves, with anyá- … anyá-, see nearby VI.49.3.) Moreover,
those who take pāda a as referring to Pūṣan’s two forms are forced to take víṣurūpe
áhanī in the simile, as a not very convincing acc. of extent of time (Ge: “du bist wie
der Himmel während der verschiedenen Tageshälften”) or the like (Re’s rendering
[“tu es commes le ciel aux deux portions-du-jour”] leaves the syntactic status of the
dual expression quite vague). Further, this interpr. pushes the simile-marking iva
almost to the end of a pāda supposedly consisting entirely of a simile. Although, as
just noted (ad VI.57.5), simile markers are sometimes positioned later than expected,
this would be quite late indeed.
So by my interpr. the two oppositional day-halves belong, in some sense, to
Pūṣan. Why I’m not sure, nor do I know why he is “like heaven.” In conjunction with
his mission to the sun in vs. 3 and the ships he uses to travel there, I might speculate
that this has to do with Pūṣan’s role as psychopomp for the dead, described in the
77
funeral hymn X.17.3–6, esp. vs. 6 prápathe pathā́
m ajaniṣṭa pūṣā́, prápathe diváḥ
prápathe prthivy ̥ ā́
ḥ / ubhé abhí priyátame sadhásthe, ā́ca parā́ca carati prajānán
“On the forward path of paths was Pūṣan born, on the forward path of heaven, on the
forward path of earth. / He wanders back and forth to both the dearest seats,
foreknowing.” Perhaps his wanderings back and forth to heaven approximate the
regular alternation of day and night, and that pair is therefore “his” in some sense.
(Such an interpr. gets us close to his two “forms,” an interpr. I have just rejected &ndash; I
still think that is wrong, however.) As for why he is like heaven, this must rest on the
hí clause of pāda c, his giving aid to all māyā́. What does this mean? Is his mission to
take the dead from earth to heaven conceptualized as a transformation of the dead,
which might be achieved by māyā́? A last, smaller but nonetheless nagging, question
is why, with day characterized as ‘gleaming’ (śukrám), is night said to be ‘belonging
to the sacrifice, worthy of the sacrifice’ (yajatám)? Most Vedic sacrifices take place
during the day, save for the Atirātra. Perhaps rites for the dead were associated more
with night. MLW adds that this is true “certainly in Roman rituals like the Lemuria
and Feralia.”
All of this speculation is tissue-thin, and I do not set much store by it.
However, at least it confronts questions that the other interpr. have not raised.</p>
<h3 id="vi582">VI.58.2</h3>
<p>Most of the contents of this vs. conform to the characteristics of Pūṣan
elsewhere in this cycle, even dhiyaṃjinvá- ‘quickening poetic vision’ (see esp.
VI.53), but “fitted into all creation” (bhúvane víśve arpitaḥ) and “surveying the
creatures” (saṃcákṣāṇo bhúvanā) attribute to him a more cosmic role than usual. His
speeding (īyate) may be a reference to his travels between earth and heaven referred
to above, ad vs. 1.
víśve is one of two loc. sg. to this stem with the noun ending -e (the other
being IV.16.9), but the pronomina víśvasmin is also only found twice, both times in
X.</p>
<h3 id="vi583">VI.58.3</h3>
<p>Pūṣan’s ships (nā́vaḥ) are, to my knowledge, not encountered elsewhere.
But, as noted above vs. 1, I would tentatively connect them and the mission of the
Sun (dūtyā́m sūryasya) with his role as psychopomp of the dead. One question is
whether there are two sets of ships &ndash; those in the sea and those in the midspace &ndash; or
one, with the midspace being configured here as the sea (Ge’s Luftmeer). I subscribe
to the latter view.</p>
<h3 id="vi584">VI.58.4</h3>
<p>Pūṣan’s “good lineage (subándhuḥ) from Heaven and from Earth” directly
recalls X.71.6 cited above ad vs. 1 prápathe pathā́
m ajaniṣṭa pūṣā́, prápathe diváḥ
prápathe prthivy ̥ ā́
ḥ “On the forward path of paths was Pūṣan born, on the forward
path of heaven, on the forward path of earth.”
On the Sūryā story, see, inter alia, my 2001 “The Rigvedic svayaṃvara?
Formulaic evidence” (Fs. Asko Parpola) and 2003 “Vedic vrā́: Evidence for the
svayaṃvara in the Rig Veda?” (Fs. H.-P. Schmidt). It is very telling that Puṣan is
given to Sūryā here (yáṃ devā́so ádadhuḥ sūryā́yai) rather than the reverse: the
78
ordinary description of marriage, at least later, is kanyā-dāna- ‘the gift of a maiden’,
but here she receives rather than being given, presumably a nod to her active role in
the Svayaṃvara. Note the much more conventional depiction of Sūryā’s wedding (to
a different bridegroom) in the wedding hymn, X.85.9 sūryā́ṃ yát pátye …
savitā́dadāt “when Savitar gave Sūryā to her husband.”
VI.59 Indra and Agni
On the structure of this hymn and the relationship between the two gods, see
publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="vi591">VI.59.1</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the clichéd́ intro. “I shall proclaim (prá √vac)
the manly deeds …” associated esp. with Indra hymns (esp. I.32) is here directed to
both gods. The “real” subjunctive vocā is found only here in the RV, in contrast to
the more common injunctive / functional subjunctive vocam.
The enclitic vām is unusually stationed pāda-final, but in fact it occupies 2nd
position in its small clause, the loc. absol. sutéṣu vām “on (the soma-drinks) having
been pressed for you two.” Ge takes vām with following vīryā̀(“euren Heldentaten”),
but the pāda break that separates them makes that less likely. Re ignores the vām in
his tr. and attaches the loc. absol. to the rel. cl., which is syntactically unlikely. Pādafinal vām is in fact a tic of this hymn; see 2a, 4a, and 5a besides our 1a. Perhaps it
echoes the 2nd syllable of yuvám ‘you two’, found at pāda end in 1d, 2c.
The contents of the 2nd hemistich is quite dramatic. The standard view going
back to Sāy. (see Ge’s n. 1c) is that the slain Fathers are the Asuras and that this
event is also reflected in the enigmatic X.124. However, see my 2016 treatment of
X.124, “The Divine Revolution of Ṛgveda X.124: A New Interpretation. Beyond
Asuras and Devas” (Ged. Staal), which rejects the view that that hymn concerns the
Deva/Asura conflict. Here in our passage, certainly the easiest interpretation is that
the rivals of the gods are the Asuras, but keep in mind that the Deva/Asura conflict
so prominent in the Brāhmaṇas and later does not really surface until very late RV.
Moreover, even in the old interpr. of X.124 neither Indra nor Agni appears to have
been an Asura. I do not know what to make of our passage, but I doubt that the old
interpr. holds.</p>
<h3 id="vi592">VI.59.2</h3>
<p>The pāda-final vām here is also in syntactic 2nd position (as it is in 1a), since
báḷ itthā́is a extra-clausal exclamation, and the clause proper begins with mahimā́.
For mahimán- with √pan, see nearby VI.75.6, as well as VIII.101.11, X.75.9,
etc.
I am puzzled by the pāda-final ā́. Gr (col. 171) classifies it as emphatic after
numbers or grades, to show that the number or grade has been reached, but the
phrases he lists there are quite heterogenous.</p>
<h3 id="vi593">VI.59.3</h3>
<p>On pleonastic sácā see comm. ad IV.31.5. Ordinarily such a sácā marks a
locative abs., but in this instance suté is to be construed with okivā́ṃsā. The pādafinal phrase suté sacām̐may be there to provide a rhyme-form variant to sutéṣu vām#
79
(1a, 4a), which really are loc. abs.</p>
<h3 id="vi594">VI.59.4</h3>
<p>In the 2nd hemistich the form bhasáthaḥ is problematic and its identity
disputed. With -thaḥ it looks like a 2nd du. act. verb, as is to be expected in a hymn
dedicated to dual divinities, esp. directly after a voc. du. devā. However, this should
be a main-cl. verb, and it therefore should not be accented. And even if it should be
accented, it has the wrong accent: we have two other forms to an apparent them.
stem, both with root accent: 3rd sg. bhásat (subjunctive to root aor., acdg. to Gotō 82)</p>
<h3 id="vi34-1">VI.3.4</h3>
<p>and identical (by most lights) VI.14.1 (I consider that form a nom. sg. part.
bhásan). In response to these problems, Ge (inter alia, going back to Aufrecht [see
Old] and cautiously endorsed in EWA s.v. BHAS) interpr. it as a noun bhasátha- ‘the
noise of the mouth when eating’ (Ge, das Geräusch des Mundes bes. beim Essen).
But although this solves the accent problems, it creates greater difficulty elsewhere:
not only would that stem be a hapax, but Ge’s attempt to fit it into the rest of the
clause produces something close to nonsense, whereas a du. verb works well in the
clausal syntax. Old and Re wisely opt for the verb (maybe also Gotō 82), the latter
without remarking on the accentual problem and the former without suggesting a
solution. I also accept it as a verb ‘snap at’ and also lack a solution to the accent. It
cannot be attributed to caná, which doesn’t induce verbal accent. Its complement is
vádataḥ, which I take as gen. sg., the correlative of yáḥ in the rel. cl. of ab &ndash; with
gen. as an alternative to acc. in verbs of consumption (biting counts). As Old points
out, it could also be acc. pl., but that would lose the connection with the rel. cl. (Re
supplies an acc. obj. on which the gen. depends: “vous ne mordez nullement (les
richesses de cet homme) qui dit …,” which seems unnec. and unmotivated.)</p>
<h3 id="vi595">VI.59.5</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., here the poet dissociates the two gods and in the
2nd hemistich focuses only on Agni. I think the dissociation begins in the 1st
hemistich, with … asyá vām … ciketati (in my tr.) “…shall perceive this one of you
two,” with asyá referring to one of the gods only. Ge and Re by contrast interpr. asyá
as referring to an unidentified thing (a wonder or the like) belonging to both.
On cd as referring to Agni and his flames, see the very similar phrase in an
Agni hymn X.79.7 víṣūco áśvān yuyuje. Gonda (Ved. Lit. 133) may be right that this
refers to Agni using the same vehicle to carry the oblations to heaven and to bring
the gods to the sacrifice. Re interpr. the hemistich as referring to both Agni and
Indra, at the cost of a lot of machinery liberally sprinkled with parens.
víśūcaḥ would be better rendered as ‘facing in opposite/different directions’.</p>
<h3 id="vi596">VI.59.6</h3>
<p>The fem. footless (apadvátī) and footless (padvátībhyaḥ) are most likely
Dawn and her cows, either the rays of light that are the Dawn cows or the real cows
that go to pasture at dawn. Cf., with Ge, I.152.3. She appears here presumably to
mark the dawn worship where the ritual fire is kindled and Indra appears.
Both Ge and Re divide the 2nd hemistich between Agni (c) and Sūrya (d). I am
in full agreement that c belongs to Agni, describing the spread of his flames and
crackling of the new fire. But I do not follow their assignment of d to Sūrya. Since
80
the hymn is dedicated to Indra and Agni, we would expect the paired god to be Indra,
not Sūrya, who has no place in the hymn. And it easily applies to Indra, as long as we
interpr. padā́as an instr. sg. of ‘foot’. Cf. with the same phrase, incl. the same verb,
I.51.6 &hellip; arbudáṃ ní kramīḥ padā́“With your foot you [=Indra] trampled down
Arbuda” and, with a diff. root but the same preverb, also of Indra, VIII.64.2 padā́
paṇī
́
m̐r arādháso, ní bādhasva “With your foot stamp down the ungenerous
niggards.” Ge and Re take padā́as neut. pl. to padá- ‘foot-step’, construed with
triṃśát as a measure of the distance that Sūrya has crossed. I don’t know why they
feel the need to introduce Sūrya here &ndash; I suppose because of Uṣas in ab.
With Ge I take cárat as a finite verb, an injunctive, accented because it’s
implicitly contrastive with the next clause.</p>

<p>With Ge (cf. also Oberlies, RdV I.457) I supply ‘him’ as obj. of yuyutám in

is not impossible, but it makes more sense to deprive the stranger of sunlight than his
hatreds.

<p>The vocab. of this vs. shows a slight tendency towards morphological
elaboration: in addition to the straightforward sáhastamā sáhasā, there is sáhurī to
the same root but with the rare suffix -uri; the deriv. vasavyà- for ‘goods’, rather than
standard vásu (as in the preceding hymn VI.59.9). This latter word returns at the end
of the hymn.
The 3rd sg. śnáthat that opens the hymn is somewhat puzzling morphologically.
The root √śnath has a poorly attested verbal system, save for the -áya-transitive and
associated redupl. aor.; besides śnáthat it consists only of two exx. of the athem.
impv. śnathihi, and a couple of -iṣ-aor. forms. Narten (258–59) argues convincingly
that śnathihi should belong to a root aor. (rather than a root pres., as it is generally
classed), which could serve as the base for the formation of the -iṣ-aor. Our form
śnáthat could formally easily be a subjunctive to this root aor., but the problem is
that a subjunctive works quite badly in context, esp., since it is explicitly conjoined
(by utá) with the following pres. indic. sanoti. It could alternatively be the injunctive
to a them. stem, though in that case it would be the only representative of that stem.
Narten discusses śnáthat in n. 810, where she rather says that though it&rsquo;s used in a
general sense, nothing stands in the way of its being a subj. to the root aor. I find this
somewhat disingenuous, as subjunctives aren’t generally (/ever?) used in such a
sense. She also allows the possibility that it could be injunctive to a thematic stem.
(see also Klein DGRV I.366, who allows either). Much as I dislike multiplying
entities, I&rsquo;m inclined to go for the thematic injunctive for functional reasons.
Unfortunately a root aor. injunc. *śnathīt would have been easy to build, so the
thematization cannot be the result of avoiding a problematic form.</p>
<h3 id="vi602">VI.60.2</h3>
<p>Assuming that uṣásaḥ … ūḷhā́ḥ is a single NP, the question is what
81
happened to the dawns. Ge, fld. by Re, thinks that the dawns were taken away, that
is, abducted (entführten, enlevées). If, as Ge suggests (n. 2), this concerns the Vala
myth, the dawns qua cows can be conceptualized as taken / stolen by the Paṇis.
(Oberlies [RdV I.180] goes further, seeing this as part of a myth about bridestealing,
ultimately involving the Aśvins, though he admits [n. 150] that our vs. does not tell
us who abducted the Dawn(s) or where she was taken.) HPS (B+I 180 n. 33, )
indignantly rejects the abduction interpr. and suggests rather that, on the basis of
VI.64.3, 5, the dawns are drawn (ūḷhā́ḥ) by bulls. Although this is possible, and the
cited passage is quite nearby, it doesn’t make a lot of sense for Indra and Agni to “do
battle” for the dawns if the dawns are moving on their own steam, whereas if they
were abducted, they need help.
In d Agni must be the immediate subj. of the clause, given the adjacency of the
voc. and the 2nd sg. verb (agne yuvase) &ndash; but, as Re points out, niyútvān is more an
epithet of Indra than of Agni &ndash; and, as he doesn’t point out, even more an epithet of
Vāyu in conjunction with Indra. I therefore wonder if this has not been adapted from
an Indra-Vāyu context, with a different set of dual divinities. The d pāda is also very
close to an Indra passage fairly nearby: VI.47.14 apó gā́vajrin yuvase sám índūn,
with Indra as the subj. of yuvase: “You join together the waters, the cows, and the
drops, you possessor of the mace.” The substitution of Agni and the attribution to
him of Indra’s qualities and actions is in conformity with the tendency noted in the
publ. intro. of favoring the Indraic in this supposedly shared hymn.</p>
<h3 id="vi604">VI.60.4</h3>
<p>I do not have a view on how (or whether) to fix the meter of pāda a; see Old.
It is thinkable, but by no means necessary, that instead of reading quadrisyllabic
índrā-agnī (as in vss. 5, 7, 14), we could read trisyllabic índrāgnī (as in 8, 9, 15) with
a haplologized enclitic naḥ: índrāgnī ná *no mardhataḥ.
VI.60.4–5: Note the phonological (and partly etymological) figure mardh(ataḥ) (4c),
mṛ́dh(aḥ) (5a), mṛḷ(ātaḥ) (5c).</p>
<h3 id="vi606">VI.60.6</h3>
<p>Note the curious position of ápa in tmesis, embedded in the obj. NP: ható

<h3 id="vi608">VI.60.8</h3>
<p>I follow Ge in construing dāśúṣe with sánti (“which are for the pious”)
rather than with puruspṛ́haḥ (Re “pour l’adorateur les très enviés”) because
puruspṛ́h- doesn’t seem to appear with a dat. elsewhere. See the almost identical
IV.47.4.
VI.60.8–9: 8c and 9a differ minimally from each other, and it is difficult to see an
aspectual (or other) distinction between root aor. impv. ā́gatam and pres. impv. ā́
gachatam &ndash; though of course there may be a nuance we cannot catch. Note also 14b
úpa gachatam and 15c ā́gatam.</p>
<h3 id="vi6010">VI.60.10</h3>
<p>The root √svañj is ordinarily middle; it has only two active forms, this one
82
(pariṣvájat) and the plupf. paryáṣasvajat in I.182.7. The latter can be explained as an
áduhat-type remarking of the middle pf. ṣasvaje (see comm. ad loc.), but this active
remarking of the them. pres. -ṣvájate is harder to explain. Gotō (1st Kl., 338–39)
notes the prevailing middle voice and this anomalous act., but makes no attempt to
account for it.</p>
<h3 id="vi6011">VI.60.11</h3>
<p>The syntactic affiliation of the final pāda of this vs., consisting of a dat.
dyumnā́ya and an acc. phrase sutárā apáḥ, is unclear. Old suggests taking the acc. as
a second obj. of āvívāsati, or rather suggests supplying the same verb as main clause
verb “(he also wins) waters …” But since the structure of ab, in which the mortal
seeks Indra’s favor, invites a demonstration of that favor in the main cl., I therefore
borrow kṛṇoti (deaccented) from 10c, with Indra as subj. This is also Re’s solution
and apparently Ge’s. For √kṛ in similar expressions, see VII.97.8 kárad bráhmaṇe
sutárā sugādhā́
“He [=Bṛhaspati/Indra] will make good fords, easy to cross, for the
sacred formulation” and IV.19.6 sutaraṇā́m akṛṇor indra síndhūn “You made the

<p>On the insistent ubhā́see publ. intro.
I have taken āhuvádhyai (and mādayádhyai) as predicated infinitives with the
subj. ubhā́, as does Re. However, vām in pāda a makes some difficulties for this
interpr., and Ge takes that pāda (but not b) as having an implicit 1st ps. subj.: “euch
beide … will ich herrufen” (a) versus “beiden sollen sich … erfreuen” for
mādayádhyai (b). I think the two clauses should be parallel and therefore take vām as
a dependent gen. on ubhā́(“both of you two”), although it must be admitted that
ubhá- generally agrees with its referent in case.</p>
<h2 id="vi61-sarasvatī">VI.61 Sarasvatī</h2>
<p>On the structure of this hymn and its similarity to the immediately preceding
one, see publ. intro.
VI.61.1–3: The hymn begins with the near-deictic nom. sg. iyám, establishing the
feminine subject immediately and emphatically (“this she here”). Since the just-given
tr. is at best graceless and, more to the point, not English, I have opted to focus on the
gender rather than the deixis. The next vs. also begins with iyám and the final vs. of
the tṛca with the voc. sárasvati.</p>
<h3 id="vi611">VI.61.1</h3>
<p>Although, as just noted, the hymn establishes the feminine referent from the
very beginning, she is also credited, from the beginning, with powers and deeds that
83
seem distinctly unfeminine, esp. pāda c.
Sarasvatī’s gift to the pious Vadhryaśva is universally, and I think correctly,
interpr. as a son named Divodāsa, and this gift is further interpr. as reflecting the
requital of the “debt to the ancestors” found in the doctrine, attested somewhat later
(1st clearly articulated in TS), of the three debts that a Brahmin owes on his birth (to
gods, ancestors, and ṛṣis). The requital of this debt is, in the standard view, expressed
by the root-noun cmpd ṛṇacyút- in our passage. I think this is more or less correct,
but not in a straightforward way. Both Ge and Re twist the sense of √cyu to get it to
express the requital of the debt directly: “der der Schuld (an die Manen) tilgte [paid
off]” (sim. Kü 153); “qui ébranle la dette (aux mânes).” But √cyu means ‘set in
motion, agitate, shake’, and the best we could do to get the idiom we want is to push
its meaning to ‘shake off’, hence ‘get rid of’, the debt. But ‘shake off’ is not a sense
of √cyu at least in my experience. An unmanipulated sense of the cmpd should be
‘shake/agitate the ṛṇa’, and that is how I interpr. it &ndash; ‘shake the debtor’ &ndash; with a
masc. ṛṇá- ‘debtor’; the only other non-neut. form of this stem is also in VI
(VI.12.5), where it likewise means ‘debtor’, not ‘debt’. In other words I assume that
Divodāsa inflicts rough punishment on a debtor; this helps explain why he is
characterized as rabhasá- ‘violent, wild’, which does not make much sense if he’s
just a baby who serves as his father’s payment to the ancestors.
However, I also think the sense seen by Ge and Re &ndash; Divodāsa as requital for
the debt his father owes to the ancestors &ndash; is also indirectly signaled here. The
standard lexeme for this technical term is rṇám √ci; a root-noun cmpd formed to this
lexeme would be ṛṇa-cí-t-, which in fact is attested once, at II.23.17. Our cmpd ṛṇacyú-t- is phonologically similar to it, and an acc. sg. *ṛṇacítam would produce a
terrible cadence (4 lights), whereas ṛṇacyútam is well adapted to a Jagatī cadence
(though the immediately preceding syllable should be heavy, not light: (rabha)sám
ṛṇacyútam. What I am suggesting is that ṛṇacyútam is the correct reading and it
means what it looks like it should mean, without the manipulation of Ge and Re. But
that it also phonologically evokes *ṛṇa-cítam, which gives a second, resonant
meaning to the passage. This suggestion is similar to, but ultimately quite distinct
from, Gotō’s (133 n. 166) that ṛṇa-cyút- is a transitive active version of ṛṇa-cít-,
generated from a Zwangslage (predicament, dilemma) in order to express the sense
‘entgegennehmen lassen’ barred from the other cmpd, which in his view means ‘die
Busse entgegennehmen’. Scar also discusses ṛṇa-cyút- at some length (126–27),
offering several possibilities, but not very usefully.
As for the notion of a man’s inborn debts in the RV, I think it is alluded to in
our text, but quite rarely. The clearest ex. is in the late hymn X.135 (see my “The
Earliest Evidence for the Inborn Debts of a Brahmin: A New Interpretation of
Ṛgveda X.135.” Journal asiatique 302.2 [2014]: 245–57), but there is another more
glancing reference to it in Maṇḍala VI in VI.20.11, also discussed in the art. cit. In
that article I argue that the original system, as seen in the RV, involves only two
debts: a son for the ancestors and sacrifice for the gods; Brahmacarya for the ṛṣis is a
later addition after the institution of studentship had developed.

<h3 id="vi612">VI.61.2</h3>
<p>Once again, the attributes and actions ascribed to Sarasvatī are decidedly
unfeminine, starting with the almost comically off-kilter comparison of her to a rootgrubbing boar. The identification of the bisakhā́- as a boar is owing to Hoffmann
(MSS 8: 5 = Aufs. 387). The point of comparison between the river and the boar
must be their noise: śúṣmebhiḥ ‘with her snortings’, though the root-grubbing is
presumably part of it, as the river in spate noisily pulls off pieces of the banks.
Note ávase in c, which echoes avasám in 1c and is in turn echoed by á
(vi)vās(ema) in d.</p>
<h3 id="vi613">VI.61.3</h3>
<p>The phonologically marked (plain b) name bṛ́ṣaya- is found elsewhere only
in I.93.4, where his offspring (there called śéṣaḥ ‘remainder’) are destroyed as they
are here. That is also the vs. that contains the parallel passage cited above ad vs. 1.
Although I.93 is a hymn to Agni and Soma and there are no clear connections
between the hymns otherwise, at the very least we can probably assume that Bṛṣa
was a paṇí-. I do not understand why víśva- modifies this PN: “every Bṛṣaya”
meaning Bṛṣaya and his ilk? his kin? (MLW adds “In Latin a name can be used in the
plural to mean ‘people like X’ Multi Mani Ariciae ‘There are many manius types at
Aricia’ This is no doubt a universal.”) Or does this imply that the word is not a PN,
but a meaningful descriptor of a foe?
Acdg. to Klein (DGRV I.434–35), the 2nd hemistich begins with an ex. of
inverse utá, conjoining the clauses of c and d though positioned at the beginning of c.
Although this is probably the default explan., I am drawn to Re’s more content-rich
suggestion that utá sets up the contrast between the very different actions of c and
d—though under that analysis we might expect a contrastively accented verb in c
(*ávindaḥ), and, moreover, he gives no parallel passages in which utá has such a
function.
The hapless ‘them’ (ebhyaḥ) in d must be the ‘god-scorners’ (deva-níd-) of a, as
is the general consensus.
VI.61.4–6: This tṛca is almost empty of content, in part because so much of each
Gāyatrī — not a capacious meter in the first place — is occupied by repeated
material: the last 6 of the 8 syllables of the 1st pāda of each vs. contain the nom. (4)
or voc. (5, 6) of the NP devī́sárasvatī, and the b pādas of 4 and 6 contain responsive
material: vā́jebhiḥ vājínīvatī (4) and x x vā́jeṣu vājini. Otherwise, as a helper (avitrī́)
she is twice asked to help (4c avatu, 6b ávā). In the publ. tr. these two impvs. are
rendered in two different ways: “Let … help” and “aid” respectively. I would now
change the 2nd to “help” as well to mark their essential identity (save for ps.). [Note
that the HvN restoration of avitry àvatu in 4c is wrong: correct their avitrí to avitrī́.]
VI.61.5–6: This, the middle vs. of the tṛca, consists only of a rel. cl., which I consider
preposed to vs. 6, though without a resumptive pronoun correlative with yáḥ. I
85
supply one (‘him’) as obj. of ávā in 6b. Both Ge and Re instead supply ‘us’ as the
obj. of that verb, leaving the rel. cl. in 5 without any syntactic tether. The middle vs.
of the next tṛca (8) also consists just of a rel. cl.
VI.61.7–9: Unlike the preceding tṛca, this one dispenses with repetition and therefore
has more room for meat, comparatively speaking.</p>
<h3 id="vi617">VI.61.7</h3>
<p>The vs.-initial utá seems to introduce the tṛca, as does the identically placed
utá in vs. 10.</p>
<h3 id="vi618">VI.61.8</h3>
<p>Like vs. 5, this middle vs. of the tṛca contains only a rel. cl., which I
consider to hang off vs. 7, though it could also attach to the flg. vs. 9. Both 7 and 9
have an overt possible correlative for yásyāḥ in 8a: 7a syā́… sárasvatī, 9a sā́.</p>
<h3 id="vi619">VI.61.9</h3>
<p>The various tr. (Ge, Re, Klein [DGRV I.402]) supply a verb in pāda a,
reserving átan (c) for bc. I do not see why. Both Ge (n. 9a) and Re do allow for the
possibility that átan has domain over the whole vs., but both identify that possible
constr. as a zeugma. Again, I don’t see why &ndash; while it is true that hatreds and rivers
are different kinds of entities, mingling of the mental and the physical is standard
practice in the RV.
Because of its position within the NP víśvā áti dvíṣaḥ, áti is probably not a
preverb in tmesis, but rather an adposition. This view is supported by the fact that
there are no other exx. of áti √tan in the RV (as Re points out) or elsewhere, at least
acdg. to Mon-Wms.
The position of anyā́ḥ identifies the sisters as a defined and limited group, and
of course, as the next vs. states (10b saptásvasā), Sarasvatī has precisely seven sister
rivers.</p>

We might expect the splv. priyátamā in this construction.
I don’t exactly know how to interpr. the VP stómyā bhūt, with injunc. aor. of
√bhū (or indic. aor? the Saṃhitā sequence stómyābhūt could contain augmented
abhūt) and the pseudo-gerundive stómya-. The same construction is found in vs. 12
hávyā bhūt (or hávyā *abhūt). In vs. 12 Hoffmann (140) takes it as iterative,
presumably because of the āmreḍita vā́je-vāje: “&lsquo;ist bei jedem Preiskampf
anzurufen.” But √bhū is a change-of-state verb and the aorist should (in a wellbehaved language) be punctual. In both vss. the standing characteristics of Saravatī
are being described, so she should not have “become one worthy to be
praised/invoked,” because the just-mentioned characteristics are not new. We might
speculate that, because there&rsquo;s no injunctive of √as, in order to express a nontemporally marked copula (as opposed to a nominal sentence with suppressed
copula) you have to turn to √bhū and the aorist injunctive. But this seems like a long
shot. Ge and Re take it as modal: “… sei … preisenswert”; “soit apte à (recevoir) …
la louange” (though Re remarks “bhūt au sens d’abhūt,” without recognizing that the
86
Saṃhitā text could in fact contain abhūt). Note that vs. 13 (which is not part of this

<p>In b urú rájaḥ ‘broad realm’ is identical with antárikṣam ‘midspace’.
Perhaps supplying two terms for one place is designed to give the impression of the
usual three-termed whole, earth, midspace, heaven — here: earth, midspace x2. The
river’s physical position presumably precludes claiming that she has filled heaven as
well.</p>
<h3 id="vi6112">VI.61.12</h3>
<p>But heaven as part of her domain is apparently smuggled in, without
naming it, in triṣadhásthā ‘having three seats’ opening this vs.
The vs. in general is characterized by fairly straightforward numerology: in
addition to the three seats, the seven parts are presumably her sister rivers and “five
peoples” is the familiar expression for the totality of the Ārya. The 1st vs. of the tṛca
inaugurated the numerology with saptásvasā ‘having seven sisters’.

<p>The sequence mahínāsu is perfectly ambiguous. It can be a fem. loc. pl. of
the poorly attested them. stem mahína-, as I take it in the publ. tr. and as Old is
inclined to do. Or, with Pp., Ge, and Re, it can be disjoined into mahínā āsu, nom. sg.
fem. to the same rare them. stem and loc. pl. fem. to the near-deictic pronoun,
unaccented because the referent is in the discourse. (Gr actually lists both mahínā
and mahínāsu for this passage.) The difference in meaning is minimal: my “… who
by her greatness shines … among the great (rivers)” versus “the great one who by
her greatness shines … among the (rivers).” I now find that I am more disposed to go
with the Pp. analysis, for reasons of wordplay, not meaning. The instr. mahimnā́in
this passage is one of only three exx. of this form in the RV, with the restored -mncluster to the stem mahimán- &ndash; against well-attested instr. mahinā́with the (old)
cluster reduction of -mn- to -n-. If we accept the Pp. interpr., the adjacent words
mahimnā́mahínā would implicitly play on both forms of the instr., with the nom. sg.
mahínā differing from the standard instr. mahinā́only by accent. If we instead take
mahínāsu as a loc., that play is lost or at least considerably diluted.

even further into the clause. Moreover, no other forms of √dagh are construed with
an instr. Instead I take ápa spharīḥ as intransitive ‘spring away’, with páyasā a
species of instr. of accompaniment or, perhaps, an instr. of separation.</p>

In c usrā́ is taken as du. by Gr., flg. the Pp. However, it more likely represents
usrā́ḥ in sandhi, a gen. sg. fem. See extensive disc. by Old ad II.39.2, as well as his brief
acknowledgement of this underlying form in his comm. on this vs..; Ge’s tr. reflects this
interpr. Inter alia, 3 (V.3.8, 45.8, VIII.46.21) of the 5 occurrences of vyúṣi are preceded
by a fem. gen. sg. asyā́(ḥ), referring to Dawn, and the 4th (besides this one) has a voc. of
Dawn uṣo vyúṣi (VII.81.2). On fem. gen. sg. usrā́ḥ see comm. ad VI.3.6
In his n. 1d Ge hesitates about the root affiliation of the desid. yúyūṣataḥ (√yu
‘join’ or √yu ‘separate’) and the function of pári (preverb or adposition). Although
his tr. reflects a root affiliation to ‘join’ (“… zu umspannen suchen”), he offers an
alternative tr. in the n. reflecting ‘separate’ (“… fortzurücken suchen”), an interpr.
followed by Heenen (Desid. 209). Such an interpr. would be conceptually possible:
in the dim light of dawn and the morning mists, the Aśvins allow the boundaries of
earth to be seen by “separating” them. However, I consider √yu ‘join’ more likely, in
the sense, with pári, of ‘encompass’, referring to the usual round-the-world journey
of the Aśvins. The constr. seems a conflation or crossing of the usual sadyáḥ [H+E]
pári √i/yā [/VERB OF MOTION] expression “encircle heaven and earth in a single day,”
as in I.115.3, 128.3, III.58.8, IV.45.7, etc., with the prior act of harnessing (√yu) the
horses. For passages that incl. ántān (as here), see V.47.4, X.108.5: e.g., V.47.4 diváś
caranti pári sadyó ántān “They circle around the ends of heaven in a single day.”</p>
<h3 id="vi622">VI.62.2</h3>
<p>This vs. presents both number and person disagreement, the first more acute
than the second. As noted above, the vs. begins with the dual NA prn. tā́, surely
referring to the Aśvins, and this 1st pāda ends with an apparent dual part. cakramāṇā́
presumably modifying the prn. But the next pāda contains a plural verb rurucuḥ
(rurucū in sandhi), which cannot take the dual as subject &ndash; nor as object. (Because of
its sandhi position cakramāṇā́could instead reflect underlying pl. -ā́ḥ, but the initial
tā́seems almost designed to anchor the participle as dual as well.) Curiously both Ge
and Kü (431) tr. the dual NP as subj. of the pl. verb without comment &ndash; either
because of a rare grammatical lapse on their parts or because they view it (without
comment) as an example of improper agreement. (It is certainly true that a dual
*rurucatuḥ would be metrically disastrous, so lax haplology would be thinkable.)
I believe that we must take the number and the number disharmony seriously,
and I therefore take pādas a and b as separate clauses. The first lacks a finite verb.
We can either consider the participle as predicated (“they two [are] striding …”) or,
my preference, as pendant to 1cd, with dual its subj. As noted in the publ. intro.,
there is another likely enjambment between vss. 2 and 3. The next question is the
identity of the pl. subj. of d. There is one pl. form in pāda a: instr. pl. śúcibhiḥ. Ge
and Kü take this as referring to the rájobhiḥ ‘spaces’ in b, but Re suggests that it
88
ancitipates the horses (áśvaiḥ) in 3bc. If we accept Re’s identification of the
‘gleaming ones’ as horses, this provides a possible pl. subj. for rurucuḥ. As gleaming
ones themselves, they could “shine the radiant beam of the chariot” through the
spaces. This may make them sound a little like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, but
at least it avoids a grammatical solecism.
The ps. disagreement is, by contrast, very mild and standard RVic practice: the
dual subj. returns in 2cd but as 2nd ps. rather than 3rd, as we learn by the verb yāthaḥ
late in pāda d.
Note c purū́várāṃsi, a rhyme form to urū́várāṃsi ending 1d.</p>
<h3 id="vi623">VI.62.3</h3>
<p>This vs. presents a different type of grammatical disharmony, though it
again concerns how to construe the first pāda. Once again it begins with du. tā́, but in
this case that prn. can be the subj. of the 2nd dual pf. ūhathuḥ. (Though by my rules,=
I would prefer not to have a 3rd ps. prn serving as subj. to a non-imperatival verb [see
my “sa figé”], I do have to reckon with a fairly clear ex. in 6ab.) The problems lie in</p>
<ol>
<li>vartíḥ ‘circuit’ and 2) yád. To begin with the 2nd, if yád is functioning as a
subordinating conjunction and ab is a single clause, ūhathuḥ in b should be accented.
(It is not clear to me what Ge does with the yád; he seems just to ignore it.) Now yád
is badly positioned for a clausal subordinator, and it is possible that rather than being
a subordinating conjunction it’s functioning as a sort of izafe
in the phrase tyád vartír yád áradhram, connecting the adj. áradhram to vartíḥ. I
would be inclined to that interpr. if it weren’t for the problem of vartíḥ itself. This
noun is always the complement of the verb √yā in the phrase “drive the/a/your
circuit,” incl. in this same hymn, 10ab … vartíḥ … yātam, and in the next one, with
phraseology similar to ours, VI.63.2 pári ha tyád vartír yāthaḥ … It would be very
difficult to make it the obj. of ūhathuḥ, which already has an obj. of its own in any
case. But the preceding pāda, 2d, has a form of √yā, and I suggest that we simply
supply it in 3a as well, which is again pendant on the preceding vs. By this interpr.,
subordinating yád is still badly positioned, but it could have been displaced by the
insistently fronted tā́in this section of the hymn. I take áradhram as a neut. adv., but
it could also modify vártiḥ (“unslackening circuit”) without benefit of an izafe.
The lexeme pári √śi means lit. ‘lie around’ and is used, e.g., of Vṛtra
surrounding the flood in IV.19.2, etc. Assuming that śayádhyai, pári here belongs to
the same lexeme, it must have a developed sense: to surround and thus circumscribe,
keep within bounds. Why a “pious mortal” would be pursuing a course that needs
such control is not clear to me. I suppose it could just mean that, since the Aśvins
circle around the earth (1cd), that circle marks the boundaries of where humans can
wander.
Note the echo effect of vártiḥ (a) / vyáthiḥ (d).</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="vi624">VI.62.4</h3>
<p>As noted ad vs 1., járamāṇa- here seems to belong to ‘sing’, not ‘awaken’,
and therefore may limit the form in 1b as well. Based on 1b huve járamāṇaḥ
“singing, I call upon” and 5b ā́vivāse “I seek to attract,” I have supplied a 1st ps.
referent for the genitives here.
89
The bahuvrīhi yuyujāná-saptī ‘having a harnessed team, having a team that has
been harnessed’ is unusual in having a middle pf. part. as its first member. (See AiG
II.1.43.) The publ. tr. “having harnessed their team,” though it follows both Gr and
Ge, is misleading: I do not think it is a bharád-vāja-, codayán-mati type governing
cmpd. I would therefore emend to “having a harnessed team,” with the occasional
pass. value of the med. pf. to √yuj; see Kü (407). However, things may be somewhat
more complex. There are four occurrences of this med. part., one nearby in VI.59.5,
three in the same metrical position as here (immed. after an opening of 5). All of
them are transitive. It is possible that a free phrase like *yuyujānā́sáptī “the two
having yoked their teams” became univerbated and reinterpreted, with adjustment of
accent and the like. But I do not insist on this.
In d pratnáḥ ‘age-old’ qualifying the priest contrasts with návyas- ‘newer’ in a,
qualifying the singer, as well as yúvānā ‘two youths’ in d referring to the Aśvins. The
first pair recurs in the next vs., 5b. See comm. there. The “age-old Hotar” is of
course Agni.</p>
<h3 id="vi625">VI.62.5</h3>
<p>The stems návyas- ‘newer’ and pratná- ‘age-old’, found at opposite ends of
the preceding vs. (a and d), are juxtposed here in the phrase pratnā́návyasā, in case
the duller members of the audience had missed the contrastive terminology in 4. But
this phrase is doing two other things as well: du. pratnā́refers to the Aśvins, who
were, in 4d, identified as yúvānā ‘youths’; and návyasā modifies vácasā, “with a
newer speech,” repairing the slightly off phrase in 4a, where it was the singer, not his
song, who was newer.
The pf. babhūvátuḥ should not have been rendered as a straight pres. in the
publ. tr. I would change to “who have become.” It also forms a slight figure with
śámbhaviṣṭhā, which precedes it immediately before the pāda break.</p>
<h3 id="vi626">VI.62.6</h3>
<p>As noted ad vs. 3, I would prefer not to have the 3rd ps. prn. tā́serving as a
subject of an indicative 2nd ps. verb (pf. ūhathuḥ), but the repetitive tā́pattern may
have imposed it here.
The adj. areṇú- ‘dustless’ (8x) twice qualifies ‘paths’ (I.35.11, 163.6); the latter
of these passages is in the instr. pl. as here. This suggests that yójanebhiḥ ‘treks’ is
used here as a near synonym for ‘paths’.
Ge takes bhujántā to √bhuj ‘benefit, enjoy à utilize’ (benutzen), but better,
with Gr, Re, Lub, to √bhuj ‘bend’. In any case this participle is clearly meant to echo
the name Bhujyu.</p>
<h3 id="vi627">VI.62.7</h3>
<p>In d I take íti as a summarizing device, indicating that the three exploits
sketched in abc are examples of the Aśvins’ sumatí-. With Ge I see no choice but to
supply a verb like ‘you showed’ to govern the acc. sumatím.
As is clear to all, cyávānā is at the least a play on the name Cyavāna (same
accent), another client of the Aśvins.</p>
<h3 id="vi628">VI.62.8</h3>
<p>The grammatical identity of bhū́mā (Pp. bhū́ma) is disputed. Ge considers it
90
to belong to a (hapax) adj. stem *bhū́man- derived from bhūmán- ‘abundance’, used
adverbially (“reichlich”). This does not seem to have much to recommend it. More
appealing is to make it somehow related to a word for ‘earth’. Re tries an instr. of
bhū́man- ‘earth’, but not with much conviction. Old rehearses &ndash; mostly to firmly
reject &ndash; other possibilities, incl. the one that I favor: that it is the loc. of bhū́mi-. He
objects that we should expect (and do indeed get) bhū́myām to this fem. stem, but at
this period I don’t think this would be necessary for a fem. short-i-stem. His other
object is more cogent, that to a short-i-stem we would expect bhū́mau pāda-final. I
don’t have a clinching arg. against this, but would point out that there is some
variation in these patterns. And this pāda seems to be playing with the heaven / earth
distinction by other means: we first have the two world halves (rodasī), followed by
(pra-)dívaḥ … bhū́mā, which distantly evokes dyā́vā-bhū́mī. The off-balance pairing
is matched by the off-balance pairing of gods and mortals discussed immediately
below.
The conjoined NP devā́nām utá martyatrā́“of gods and among mortals” shows
the familiar god / mortal opposition, but what Klein (DGRV I.311–12) calls “a
peculiar absence of morphological parallelism.” It is tempting to make it mean “the
anger of the gods towards mortals,” but I think utá is there precisely to block that
reading, pace Scar (429) “Den Groll der Götter … der auch auf die Sterblichen
gerichtet …ist.”</p>
<h3 id="vi629">VI.62.9</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the syntax of this vs. is unregulated. However,
the sense is quite clear. The first hemistich consists of a rel. clause, whose rel. prn.
and finite verb are both in the 3rd sg.: yáḥ … cíketat “who will keep watch”; it also
contains another verbal form, vidádhat, which I take, with Ge and Old, as a pres.
part. nom. sg. m. to the redupl. pres. of √dhā, but which could be, as Old points out,
a short-vowel subjunctive (so, “… will regulate … and will keep watch”). (Nothing
rides on the choice.) But this happy singular environment is interrupted by a dual
nom./acc. (which must be nom. in this case) rā́jānau “two kings,” which is further
specified by the two nom. singulars mitró váruṇaḥ. The sense is clearly “which one
(of) the two kings, M (or) V …,” but this is not what it says: “which one, the two
kings, Mitra, Varuṇa, will keep watch,” leaving the audience to choose what subject,
in what number, it prefers.
I take rájasaḥ as the gen. obj. of cíketat (so also Old), in the usual syntactic
pattern of verbs of perception, which can take acc. or gen. complements. By contrast,
Ge has it dependent on rā́jānāu, but, as Re points out, the two are rather distant, and
further I know of no other passages in which rájas- is construed with rā́jan-,
although that expression would be appealingly alliterative &ndash; though it is true that
M+V are called dhartā́rā rájasaḥ “upholders of the space” in V.69.4.
The second hemistich has no direct syntactic connection to the first, though
again it is quite clear what is meant. It contains a 2nd sg. impv. asya ‘hurl’, which
must be addressed to the referent of the rel. prn. in ab &ndash; that is, either Mitra or
Varuṇa. Although it is common to change person reference even within RVic vss., it
is somewhat unusual to do so in this kind of syntagm.
91
In d Re calls the phrase dróghāya cid vácase a bahuvrīhi “défait,” for *droghavacas- [he gives no accent], like drogha-vā́c-. Judging from his tr. “auf den gar
verlogenen Anuiden,” Ge seems to agree. But this seems unnec.; the dative targets of
the missile in c and d are both s-stem abstracts, rákṣas- ‘demonic power’ and vácas-
‘speech’ respectively. I see no reason to try to manipulate the target in d to be
personal. Scar (469) interpr. as I do.</p>
<h3 id="vi6210">VI.62.10</h3>
<p>I supply ‘to prosper’ with tánayāya on the basis of nearby VI.49.5
(=I.183.3) … iṣayádhyai, vartír yāthás tánayāya tmáne ca, with very similar
phraseology.
I take pāda c with ab, rather than with d, as is the norm (Ge, Kü [509]), in order
to capture the opposition between ántara- ‘nearer’ and sánutya- ‘distant’. Cf., e.g.,
VI.5.4, which has both ántara- and sánutya- as well as vanuṣyá-. By my interpr. the
Aśvins are urged to come near to us, “because of the distant dereliction of a(nother)
mortal” &ndash; that is, because some other mortal, far away, hasn&rsquo;t done his ritual duty,
they should come to us, who will. I suppose I could construct a way to take c with d:
some mortal’s dereliction of duty would cause the Aśvins to chop off some heads.
But I find it easier to account for c as presented. The last, independent pāda just takes
part in the general bloodthirstiness of the last few vss.
Against Ge, who takes it to √vṛj, I assign vavṛktam to √vraśc ‘hew’, along with
Whit (Rts), Gr, Re, and Kü, inter alia. Cf. the clinching parallel in X.87.16 téṣāṃ
śīrṣā́ṇi … ápi vṛśca.</p>
<h3 id="vi6211">VI.62.11</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the last phrase of the hymn, gṛṇaté citrarātī
“you two providing bright gifts for the singer” exactly repeats the end of vs. 5, which
marked a transition in the earlier part of the hymn.</p>
<h2 id="vi63-aśvins">VI.63 Aśvins</h2>
<p>The hymn contains many metrical irregularities and a marked tendency towards
10-syl. lines. See Old for details and disc.</p>
<h3 id="vi632">VI.63.2</h3>
<p>The abl. (or, in principle, gen.) riṣáḥ is a bit hard to construe. Whenever this
form occurs elsewhere (and it’s not rare), it is with a form of either √pā or √rakṣ:
“protect from harm.” Ge supplies ‘protect’ here as well: “(zum Schutz) gegen
Schaden.” However, in the absence of a lexical ‘protect’ and in the presence of a
verb of motion (yāthaḥ), I take it as an ablative of place from which.</p>
<h3 id="vi633">VI.63.3</h3>
<p>There is no expressed subj. to ákāri and the abl./gen. ándhasaḥ has nothing
to depend on. Ge takes it as a partitive gen. (n. 3a) but simply tr. as an indef. subject
(“Trank ist euch bereitet”), while Re takes it as belonging to an elliptical construction
and suggests supplying either sutám or pā́ntam. I prefer to assume that the subject of
ákāri has been gapped, and ándhasaḥ is an abl. of source.
In this context I take várīman ‘in/on the expanse’ as referring to the ritual
ground on which the barhis has been strewn, rather than simply Ge’s “in voller
92
Breite.” See váriman in 11.
vavande is of course ambig. as to person, but given the 1st ps. in 2a and no
intermediate 3rd ps. officiant, it is most likely 1st (so also Ge).
In real-world terms the phrase “the stones have anointed you” is, of course,
distinctly peculiar. But in the foreshortened universe of RVic discourse, this simply
abbreviates the sequence “the stones pressed out the soma liquid, which was
prepared for you to drink, and your drinking of it was as if it were anointing you (and
perhaps did, by running down your chins).”</p>
<h3 id="vi634">VI.63.4</h3>
<p>The ‘gift’ (rātí-) in b is the ladle containing the ghee. Re points to passages
(III.19.2, IV.6.3) where the ladle is described as rātín- ‘possessing/providing gifts’.
In d Ge takes áyukta as passive, with the Hotar as subj. and nā́satyā as the obj.
of a loc. inf. hávīman: “der eingespant is, die Ns zu laden.” The pass. interpr. is
explicitly rejected by both Old and Re, in favor of a rendering like mine. Although
Ge’s interpr. is appealing in certain ways, there are several things against it: 1) the
well-attested mid. root aor. of √yuj is almost always transitive (pass. áyukta in
V.17.3, I.48.7) &ndash; there is after all a distinct passive aor. áyoji, áyujran to express this
function; 2) I know of no instances (nor does Old) in which loc. hávīman(i) functions
as an infin. and takes an object.</p>
<h3 id="vi636">VI.63.6</h3>
<p>I assume that “the flourishing of Sūryā” is simply an elaborate way of
saying Sūryā. (MLW comments simply “Cf. Gk. βίη Ἡρακλείη.”) Ge (n. 6b; fld. by
Re) suggests that it is meant to convey that the beauty of Sūryā increases the beauty
of the Aśvins but I don&rsquo;t see this. I take the dat. śubhé in the same way as śriyé (5a
and commonly elsewhere, e.g., in the next hymn VI.64.1), vápuṣe (6c), as vaguely
attached datives of purpose/result.
The latter (vápuṣe) Ge takes adverbially (“erstaunlich”), and he construes vām
simply as a poss. gen. (“Eure Vogel(rosse)”). I think there is more content here and
take ánu with vām (“after/following you”), separated because vām is taking
Wackernagel’s position. The beautiful chariot of the beautiful Aśvins carrying the
beautiful Sūryā must have been an amazing sight, and the birds in their wonder
follow it. As their relative geographical positions indicate (birds after chariot), I
think these birds are not, or not only, the Vogelrosse pulling the Aśvins chariot, but
also the birds in the world who see the marvel and rise up to accompany it. The
songs of the birds in a choir (vā́ṇī) reach the Aśvins to make them well-praised
(súṣṭutā). As this indicates, I take súṣṭutā as dual (so also Gr, Ge), a proleptic adj.
describing the state of the Aśvins after the birdsongs reach them. However, as Ge
points out (n. 6d), súṣṭutā could also be a nom. sg. fem. modifying vā́ṇī ‘choir,
music’, and the adj. is in fact strategically placed between the nom. sg. fem. and the
duals. Although a “well-praised choir” doesn’t make a lot of sense in this context, Ge
cites VIII.100.11 … vā́k … súṣṭutā &ndash; though it’s worth pointing out that in that
passage the reference is to the goddess Speech, while in our passage, as noted, I take
the vā́ṇī as referring to the “choir” of birdsong.
93</p>
<h3 id="vi637">VI.63.7</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the chariot journey in this vs. echoes the
mythological one in vs. 6 but updated to a wish for the present day.
Ge divides the 2nd hemistich into two separate clauses, by pāda. In this interpr.
the nouns in d are in the nom. pl. and follow the Aśvins’ chariot that was launched in
c (“viele Labsale … folgen ihm”). The publ. tr. takes the two pādas as a single cl.,
with the nouns in d in the acc. pl. and the chariot following them. Neither of these
conjures up an entirely comfortable picture if ánu is strictly ‘following’ – either all
the good stuff got left behind and has been sent after the chariot, or it’s all zipping
along ahead. But my accusative alternative could be taken to mean that the
refreshments et al. are already at the ritual ground. This would be supported by ab,
esp. b. But it is contra-indicated by VI.62.4 in the immediately preceding Aśvin
hymn, where pŕkṣam and íṣam are two of the things the Aśvins are bringing.
However, if iṣídh- is a variant of niṣṣídh- ‘tribute’ (see below), the first of these
alternatives is the more likely.
The hapax iṣídh- is of uncertain formation and meaning, though it obviously
falls into the category of desirable things at the ritual. There are (at least) two
competing etymologies. One has it as the doublet of niṣṣídh- ‘tribute’ (for lit. see
EWA I.198; favored by Re); the other (see EWA I.200) as a deformation of a
putative <em>iṣudh-, like the likewise hapax pṛkṣúdh- (I.141.4), serving as the base of the
denom. iṣudhyá- and cognate to Aves. išud-. The ud(h)- in these forms is explained
by Humbach as the zero-grade of the PIE root √</em>uedh ̯ ‘lead’, no longer found in
Indo-Aryan as a verbal root. (I suggest an alternative etym. of iṣudhyá- ad I.128.6
and more fully in my forthcoming article “Vedic iṣudhyá- and Old Avestan išud-,
išūidiia-: The Aim of Praise.”) Narten (YH 159-63) accepts Humbach’s etym. and
further explains our iṣídh- as altered from *iṣúdh- by folk etymology with √idh
‘kindle, burn’ (162 n. 104) in passages in which the word is connected with Agni,
since kindling wood is Agni’s source of strength. This last seems quite weak to me:
‘burn’ contributes no obvious semantics to the noun at least in its only occurrence
here &ndash; which has nothing to do with Agni &ndash; and the iṣudhyá- forms, though not
numerous, ought to provide some anchor against such a deformation. For this reason
I tentatively follow the first interpr., though only because nothing better seems to be
currently on offer. If iṣídh- is somehow a doublet of niṣṣídh-, which occurs several
times with pūrvī́ḥ (III.51.5, VI.44.11) as here, then the reference would be to the
tributes that the Aśvins received from the mortal worshippers. I would now alter the
tr. to “… after the refreshments, fortifying powers, and the many tributes.”</p>
<h3 id="vi638">VI.63.8</h3>
<p>The hapax ásakrām is another proleptic adj. (see 6d). This fem. sg. can
apply equally to the two fem. sgs. dhenúm and iṣám.
The ánu that has not yielded completely satisfactory sense in 6c and 7d here is
entirely at home: the various ritual offerings to the Aśvins, both verbal (stútaḥ …
suṣṭutíḥ) and physical (rásāḥ, the soma juices), accrue to them following the gift they
bestow on the sacrificers.</p>
<h3 id="vi639">VI.63.9</h3>
<p>Although in the publ. tr. I accept Ge’s interpr. of pakvā́as ‘cooked (food)’
94
(so also Gr, Hoffmann [231], Klein [DGRV I.97], Scar [587]), in this mass of
valuable livestock I now find it unlikely that the poet would memorialize for
posterity the gift of a few ready-prepared meals. It is more likely to be a technical
term in animal husbandry &ndash; perhaps ‘mature(d)’ (&lt; ‘ripened’), qualifying horses or
cattle of a particular age. Although it is neut. pl. and therefore can’t qualify the
animals directly, I suggest that parallel to sg. śatám in the conjoined phrase sumīḷhé
śatám peruké ca pakvā́, we may supply *śatā́(ni) *gávām pakvā́“mature hundreds of
cows” for “*hundreds of mature cows.” A similar constr. seems to be suggested by
Gr (Nachtr. to śatá-), where he proposes that pakvā́be construed with śatám as an
ex. of his 10) “der Singular neben einem in gleichem Casus stehenden Substantiv des
Plurals.” Although this particular interpr. seems precluded by the ca in the passage, I
do think the neut. pakvā́qualifies a (gapped) neut. numeral. I would now alter the tr.
to “and (hundreds) of mature (cows) at (the hands of) Peruka.”
Hoffmann (230–31) interprets the two clauses in the 2nd hemistich as modal,
with injunc. dāt rendered as ‘soll … schenken’ and the sandhi form abhiṣā́ca interpr.
as an inf. *abhiṣā́ce with the sense “soll … folge.” This is all in service of his
somewhat bizarre insistence that the injunctive aorist doesn’t express immediate past
tense (aktuelle Vergangenheit), which is, in his view, the province of the augmented
aorist. At least in my view, Hoffmann’s restricted and often non-linguistically
grounded model of the injunctive has led him to deny the obvious intent of the
dānastuti here: the gift generally needs to have been given to be praised! As for the
supposed infinitive *abhiṣā́ce (which, it must be admitted, he does not insist on),
there are no other such forms, whereas the nom. pl. is attested elsewhere. We must
simply accept that it takes verbal rection, here the acc. pl. ṛṣvā́n; see Scar (587–88).
On smáddiṣṭi- see comm. ad III.45.5.</p>
<h3 id="vi6310">VI.63.10</h3>
<p>As in the immediately preceding vs. Hoffmann (230–31) interprets the two
forms of dāt as modal, “soll … spenden.” The same objections apply.
The voc. nāsatyā was omitted in the publ. tr.
The voc. vīra is stubbornly sg., though the reference must be to the du. Aśvins.
Perhaps, as MLW suggests, simply a shortened du. voc.</p>
<h3 id="vi6311">VI.63.11</h3>
<p>I take loc. váriman in the same way as its variant in 3a, as referring to the
ritual ground. Ge here: “in weitem Masse,” seemingly referring to the patrons.</p>
<h2 id="vi64-dawn">VI.64 Dawn</h2>
<h3 id="vi641">VI.64.1</h3>
<p>supátha- and sugá- recur in 4a, conjoined by utá.
Note the phonological reciprocity between víśvā and vásvī in the same metrical
position in c and d respectively. The latter is, of course, simply the fem. to vásu-
‘good, goods’, and here it must make at least partial reference to the goods Dawn
disburses, she being here the Dakṣiṇā, priestly gift, personified. This could have been
better conveyed in the publ. tr. by ‘goodly’ rather than just ‘good’. I think there may
also be a buried grammatical pun, for, if there existed such a stem, the -in-stem
95
possessive to vásu- should be *vasvín- ‘possessing goods’, with nom. sg. *vasvī́,
differing from our form only by accent.
It would be possible to construe pāda with abhūt and a pred. nom.: “she has
become the goodly priestly gift …” But it is common in Dawn hymns to announce
the arrival of Dawn in the first verse, and an annunciatory “she has appeared” (&lt;
“come into being”) is more in harmony with the usual practice of Dawn hymns. This
is the tack of the standard tr. (Ge, Re; see also Gonda [Ved. Lit. 218]).</p>
<h3 id="vi643">VI.64.3</h3>
<p>As Ge points out (n. 3cd), the acc. śátrūn must be read as the obj. of both
similes and acc. támaḥ ‘darkness’ as the obj. of both frames, though the former only
appears in c and the latter in d. The two similes compare Dawn not only to a male
figure, but to a skillful, highly trained male warrior: archer and chariot-driver.
In c the simile marker iva occurs after the 2nd term, not the 1st (might expect
*śū́ra ivā́stā śátrūn). Perhaps śū́ra- ástar- is perceived as a unity, “champion archer”;
cf. I.70.11 ásteva śū́raḥ, IV.36.6 śū́ro ástā, I.8.4 śū́rebhir ástṛbhiḥ, and, with lexical
substitution, II.42.2 vīró ástā. There is also the fact that in similes with three terms
matching two different cases, there’s some fluctuation in the position of the simile
marker.</p>
<h3 id="vi644">VI.64.4</h3>
<p>For sugá- supátha- see vs. 1.
Ge suggests that avāté “(even) when it is windless” describes a wonder, that
Dawn crosses the water even without wind in her sails. I am not sure what evidence
we have for sails, in addition to oars, in ancient Indian boats, but I have not
systematically inquired into this. However, the “windless” circumstances might
simply make reference to the previous pāda: the waters are also sugá- ‘easy to travel’
when there is no wind and therefore no turbulence. The word avāté also plays off the
descriptor of Dawn in the next vs. (5a), ávātā ‘unsurpassable, unvanquished’; Old in
fact suggests that we might read *ávāte, voc. of the latter stem, though a word play is
much more satisfying poetically, and he does not dismiss the ‘windless’ interpr. out
of hand.</p>
<h3 id="vi645">VI.64.5</h3>
<p>The beginning of the first pāda, sā́ā́[so Pp., Saṃhitā sā́] vaha yā́, replicates
almost exactly the beginning of 4c, sā́na ā́vaha. The close similarity of the two
openings supports the disjoining of sā́in 5a into sā́ā́, which is also required by the
meter.
As noted above, nom. sg. fem. ávātā ‘unvanquished, unsurpassable’ plays on
the loc. avāté ‘windless’ in 4b. The neg. stem ávāta- is generally paired with the
positive pres. part. vanván, in the phrase vanvánn ávātaḥ “winning but unwon” (5x,
incl. VI.16.20, 18.1 in this maṇḍala). But here and in nearby VI.67.8 it is found in the
fem. and outside of the contrastive pair. In neither of these passages is the application
of the adjective clear. I have therefore, somewhat reluctantly, adopted a version of
Re’s attenuated ‘insurpassable’ (which, however, he seems to reject in his n.).
Both Ge and Re take cd as a unified rel. cl. (e.g., “die du als Göttin &hellip;
erschienen bist”), but this is impossible, because bhūḥ is unaccented. I instead attach
96
c to ab, and take d as an independent imperatival clause. I now see that it would be
possible to take cd together, with the nominal rel. cl. yā́ha devī́acting as an izafe; as
noted elsewhere (passim) such izafe-like rel. phrases can be embedded. This would
produce a tr. “You, who are a goddess, o daughter of heaven, become worthy to be
seen …,” with no appreciable difference in meaning. It might then be better to stick
with the arrangement of the publ. tr.</p>
<h3 id="vi646">VI.64.6</h3>
<p>This vs. is identical to I.124.12.
Pāda b may contain another izafe-like embedded rel. construction, like the
possible one in 5c: náraś ca yé pitubhā́jaḥ “and the men who are partakers of food.”
The question turns on where to construe hemistich-final vyùṣṭau. It could belong to
the rel. cl. “… partake of food at the first flush,” in which case there would be no
embedding. But it seems as if this temporal designation should apply to both actions:
the flying up of the birds and the eating of the men, not just the latter. Moreover te in
2nd pos. of the hemistich is most easily construed with vyùṣṭau at the end, in which
case the nominal rel. must be embedded.
This hemistich also seems syntactically unbalanced. If we assume that we have
an “X and which Y” construction, conjoining birds and men (so Klein, DGRV I.56),
they should be the joint subject of úd … apaptan ‘have flown up’, an action
appropriate to the first group but not the second. Surely the real intent is that at the
moment of dawn the birds fly up and the men eat, so what is intended to be conjoined
are the two verbal notions, with one a finite verb and the other the 2nd member of a
root noun cmpd. (on which see Scar 352).</p>

<h3 id="vi651">VI.65.1</h3>
<p>As Re points out, the expected expression is duhitā́diváḥ “daughter of
heaven,” but it has been elaborated here by the cmpd divojā́ḥ ‘born of heaven’, with
the gen. as 1st member. The standard phrase returns in the last vs.
This vs. piles on the words for night and darkness: rāmyā́su … támasaś cid
aktū́n “amid the nights … even across the nocturnal shades of darkness.”</p>
<h3 id="vi652">VI.65.2</h3>
<p>The same emphasis on the dark night is found here in táma ū́rmyāyāh (with
acc. támaḥ as head noun, against the dep. gen. támasaḥ in the previous vs. (1d). With
ū́rmyā- here the poet introduces yet another ‘night’ word.
VI.65.3–4: There is lexical chaining between 3d and 4a with the identical phrase
vidhaté rátnam in the same metrical position.
VI.65.4–5: For the repeated opening idā́(4a, 4b, 4c, 5a) see publ. intro. The two

<p>On the difficulties and with an overview of the Maruts’ birth story in vss. 1–5,
see publ. intro. The hymn was treated at length by P. von Bradke, “Von der Marut
wunderbarer Geburt, RV̥ 6, 66” in Fs. von Roth (1893), 117–25, whose disc. is in
great part incorporated into Old’s notes.</p>
<h3 id="vi661-1">VI.66.1</h3>
<p>This vs. is conceptually, lexically, and syntactically similar to VI.48.22; see
extensive disc. ad loc., with ref. to other passages alluding to this mythological event.
For nā́ma pátya- “own a name,” cf. II.37.2 dadír yó nā́ma pátyate “who owns
the name ‘giver’,” adduced by Re.
The 2nd hemistich consists of a truncated anyá- … anyá- construction, with the
2nd anyá- gapped. This implicitly contrastive structure must account for the accent on
pīpā́ya in the first clause.
Contra the standard interpr. (Old, Ge, Re), I take śukrám and ū́dhaḥ separately,
as the double acc. obj. of √duh, rather than having the former an adj. modifying
‘udder’, also in other relevant passages that contain the same two words (II.34.2,
IV.3.10).</p>
<h3 id="vi662">VI.66.2</h3>
<p>For a more complex comparison of the Maruts to fire(s), see vs. 10.
In c, where the gen. pl. eṣām seems to preclude the Maruts as referent of the
nom. pl. areṇávo hiraṇyáyāsaḥ, Sāy. supplies ráthāḥ, and this might be possible or at
least harmless, although the positive evidence for it is slim. The 2nd adj. hiraṇyáyais used not infrequently of chariots or their parts (wheels, wheel-rims), but also of a
wide range of other things, including gods and those include the Maruts (V.87.5);
‘dustless’ has a more limited range of application. In nearby VI.62.6 it qualifies
yójanebhiḥ, rendered there as ‘treks’ and, as I argue ad loc., a near synonym for
‘paths’, which are twice described as ‘dustless’ (I.35.11, 163.6). This is as close as
we’ll get to chariots: in its 8 occurrences it is never used of chariots or parts thereof.
It is, however, used of the Maruts in I.168.4. Because chariots are intrusive in our
passage and interrupt the otherwise constant reference to the Maruts in the nom. pl.
(ab and, in my opinion, d) and because the combination of adjectives doesn’t point to
chariots &ndash; or any referent but the Maruts, who are described by both adjectives
elsewhere &ndash; I now think the nom. plurals in c refer to the Maruts. What then to do
with eṣām? I propose construing it with the instrumentals in d. The pāda boundary
intervenes, but this is hardly fatal. I would now emend the tr. to “dustless and golden,
they came into being all at once with their (eṣām) manly and male powers.”
However, pace Ge and Re, even if we were to keep ‘chariots’ as the referent in
c, I do not think these same chariots could be the subj. of d. Rather, by that interpr.,
c is parenthetic and the Maruts return as subj. in d, which again treats the topic of
their simultaneous birth. Ge’s parallels (see n. 2cd) contravene his tr. (“ihre
staublosen goldigen (Wagen) sind zugleich mit ihren Manneskräften und Stärken
entstanden”) because the parallel passages with sākám √jan (etc.) all concern the
98
birth of the Maruts—certainly not their chariots!
Pāda-init. sākám plays off identically position sakṛ́t in 1d.</p>
<h3 id="vi663">VI.66.3</h3>
<p>There is much disagreement about this vs.; my interpr. is closest to Old. In
my opinion (and in Old’s too, though he doesn’t use the term ‘gender-bending’), this
once again, as in vs. 1, refers to the gender-bending androgyny of Pṛśni who fulfills
both maternal and paternal roles in the birth of the Maruts, though Rudra is identified
as their father in pāda a.
The masc. pl. rel. pronouns yé (a) and yā́n (b) have no direct correlative in
either c or d. But both the gen. sg. maháḥ in c (see below) and subhvè in d (see
below) pick up the masc. pl. conceptually. For a similar &ndash; and clearer &ndash; example see
vs. 9, with ab referring to the Marut troop in the sg., and cd picking up that reference
with pl. rel. prn. yé (c) and a pl. abl. noun (d).
In b, despite the lack of an identifying gendered pronoun or adj., the subject and
the referent of dā́dṛviḥ must be Pṛśni, as is generally agreed.
In c Old discusses the possible interpr. of maháḥ at some length. Much depends
on the analysis of vidé. Ge takes it as transitive (“denn die Mutter kennt ihre
Grossen”), with maháḥ acc. pl.; Re as well, though with a diff. interpr. of maháḥ. But
vidé is overwhelmingly pass.-intrans.; only VII.40.5, cited by Ge (n. 3c) seems to
require a transitive interpr. I take vidé in its usual passive sense and interpr. maháḥ as
a gen. sg. dependent on mātā́; the sg. referent is the collectivity of the Maruts in their
flock.
Note the allit. in c: mātā́mahó mahī́and the etymological relationship between
the last two terms. Note also the unusual pāda-final position of sā́, which may result
both from being displaced by the alliterative sequence (though why not 1st position?)
and from the desire for the striking repetitive ṣā́, sā́over the pāda and clause
boundary. This repetition is enhanced by the matching vowels before and after:
(mah)ī́ṣā́, sā́í(t). This is only one of two rukied ṣā́'s in the RV (the other = X.64.15
#ví ṣā́), even though sā́occurs elsewhere in ruki environment (even pāda-finally, as
in VIII.27.18 &hellip; nú sā́#). I do not understand the reason for the ruki: there does not
seem to be particularly close syntactic nexus between mahī́and sā́here.
Pāda d fully expresses the gender paradox, at least by my interpr. (and Old’s).
As noted in the publ. intro., gárbham √dhā ‘place the embryo’ is the defining idiom
of the male role in pregnancy, and here it is difficult (but not impossible!) to avoid
taking its subject to be the female Pṛśni. In fact, both Ge and Re (tr.) do wriggle out
of it, by making sét [= śā́íd] pṛ́śniḥ a nominal sentence (Re’s “elle (s’appelle) Pṛśni”
has a particularly peculiar charm) and supplying Rudra as the subj. of the idiom. But
there is no support for this in the passage, and only insistence on expected gender
roles can impose the interpr. Indeed the init. sā́íd draws attention to the paradox: “it
was just her &ndash; Pṛśni &ndash; who emplanted the embryo. (Interestingly, while Re follows
the Ge tack in his tr., in his comm. he embraces the paradox: “c’est Pṛśni qui (en
fait : íd) a mis le germe …” Since the tr. and the comm. are found in the same
fascicle of EVP &ndash; X, pp. 40 and 98–99 respectively &ndash; his about-face is headspinningly rapid. It should also be admitted that Ge [in n. 3d] also allows the
99
possibility of a single clause and a feminine subject.)
This leaves subhvè. In the Rudra-as-emplanter scenario, this dat. refers to Pṛśni
(see Ge n. 3d and Re [tr.] “en (l’épouse) feconde,” also Scar 369), but part of the
reason for Re’s change of heart was that he did not believe that subhvè could be fem.
(see his comm.). In the Pṛśni-as-emplanter scenario subhvè would refer to Rudra (so
Gr, Old, Re [comm.]). I think neither solution is correct. The cmpd. subhū́- in the pl.
is used a number of times of the Maruts (5.41.13, 55.3, 59.3, 87.3), including once in
a birth context: V.55.3 sākáṃ jātā́ḥ subhvàḥ “born all at once, good in essence.” As
with mahȧḥ in pāda c I interpr. the singular here as referring to the collectivity of the
Maruts.</p>
<h3 id="vi664">VI.66.4</h3>
<p>Another difficult vs., esp. the end of pāda a: áyā nú, which has provoked
much disc. (see esp. Old). I consider it a śleṣa. Central to my approach is the
assumption that there’s a clause break before these two words in either reading. On
the one hand, I have adopted von Bradke’s clever idea (op. cit., 121), that áyā nú is
direct speech, with áyā the 1st sg. pres. subjunctive to √i ‘go’ followed by the
temporal particle nú in expected clause-2nd position. This is the collective
announcement of the Maruts, “who do not retreat from their birth”: “I will go now.”
They are eager to exit the womb (or udder). We might of course expect a plural verb,
but Marut reference always vacillates between pl. and collective sg. (see in fact the
immediately preceding vs. 3), and this exact expression echoes that of Indra in the
narrative of his unnatural birth in IV.18.2 nā́hám áto nír ayā “I will not go from
here,” a narrative that might well have been familiar to all.
The other reading of áyā is the more generally accepted one, though I think
other interpr. have missed a crucial detail. It is generally taken as the instr. sg. fem.
of the ayám prn. (back to Max Müller; see Ge n. 4a). But this form is ordinarily
accented on the final, ayā́. Initial accent on the oblique forms of this pronominal stem
is restricted to emphatic usage in pāda-initial position (cf. the variant usage of, e.g.,
ásya, asyá, and asya). Those like Ge and Re who take it as this instr. but construe it
with the rest of pāda a must wave away the accent (or ignore it, as Re does). For such
interpr. cf. “Die nicht vor der Geburt auf diese Art zurückscheuen …”; “… devant un
naissance de la sorte” (my italics). However, init. accent is perfectly at home if we
assume a clause break before áyā, an assumption supported by the position of nú,
which overwhelmingly takes 2nd or modified 2nd position. I think it emphatically
announces the way the birth really happened &ndash; and given the unnaturalness of the
birth (being “milked out” of their mother), emphasis is certainly called for.
Either of these interpr. seems to require that the yád in c actually have domain
over b as well (though there might be a way out of that if one were sufficiently
ingenious), but given the syntactic tangle the vs. is already in and the looseness of the
relativization elsewhere in this hymn) (see a similar problem in the next vs., 5b, this
does not seem to me too much of a problem.
In b it is not clear to me what flaws the Maruts needed to purify; Ge (n. 4b)
suggests it’s the unnatural pregnancy and birth, and he may well be right.
Gr (and Lub) assign ukṣámānāḥ to √ukṣ ‘sprinkle’, but ‘grow’ seems more
100
likely (so also Ge, Re).
Our problematic expression may have spawned the two ánu forms (in c and d)
from áyā nú. The first is in the familiar expression ánu jóṣam (II.21.3, etc.)
“according to / at pleasure”; the latter I construe with tanvàm (cf. I.147.4 ánu
mrk̥ ṣīṣta tanvàm, with similar discontinuity). Neither √vakṣ / ukṣ nor √mṛc otherwise
ánu.</p>
<h3 id="vi665">VI.66.5</h3>
<p>This last vs. of the birth saga does not let up on obscurity, and my interpr.
differs in part from those of others, though there is general agreement on the point of
the vs.; see, e.g., Ge (n. 5): that the Maruts got no milk from their mother, but
undeterred, they quickly became the Maruts we know, with their shared name and
their tumultuous behavior. It is striking that the vs. also identifies the Maruts with
Pṛśni verbally. Not only is the same construction used for their names (1b, 5b; see
next para.), but within the vs. both Pṛśni (a) and the Maruts (c) are called ayā́s-
‘irrepressible’ (with this adj. regularly used of the Maruts elsewhere), and sudā́nu-
‘of good drops/gifts’, a standing epithet of the Maruts, is applied to Pṛśni in d (see
Ge’s n. 5d)
The vs. is also linked ring compositionally with vs. 1. In 1b it is asserted that
the two udders referred to in 1c and d — the latter being Pṛśni’s udder, which will
produce the Maruts as milk — “own the same name ‘milker’” (samānáṃ nā́ma dhenú
pátyamānam), while in 5b the Maruts after birth assume their (shared) name
“Marut”: ā́nā́ma dhṛṣṇú mā́rutaṃ dádhānāḥ &ndash; note, inter alia, the echo of dhenú in
dhṛṣṇú. Note also 1c / 5a LOC doháse: in 1c the other (=non-Pṛśni) udder constantly
gives milk (doháse) to mortals (márteṣu), while here in 5a Pṛśni does not give milk
(ná … doháse) to the Maruts (yéṣu) even right after birth &ndash; even though she milked
them out of that very udder.
The vs. also has repeated phonological play with ayā́(a), ayā́so (c), (áv)a yāsad
(d), picking up the problematic áyā of 4a.
In addition to its other problems, the vs. is metrically troubled, with a bad
cadence in a and 9 syllables in c.
Both Ge and Old (and also von Bradke) take makṣū́with the b pāda, which
requires the rel. cl. of pāda a to be embedded, but I think it goes rather with its own
pāda, indicating that even right after their birth Pṛśni deprived them of milk (sim.
Re). I then take the yé of c to have domain over b as well &ndash; the same aberrant
relative placement as suggested for 4bc.
The hapax stauná- is, as Re says, “ininterprétable” (which does not stop him
from trying). Ge suggests reading *astaunāḥ (with abhinihita sandhi after yé in the
Saṃhitā text), deriving it from √stu and tr. ‘ohne Lob(?)’. Although this has the
merit of connecting it to a known root and without phonological disturbance, I find
Re’s tr. “sans être inertes” (without comm. on the etym., but perhaps based on von
Bradke’s “Sie stehen nicht still”) more appealing in context, since it would provide a
satisfying contrast with ayā́saḥ: in Re’s tr., “eux qui, sans être inertes, (sont bien au
contraire) inlassables.” I am also struck by the echo pointed out by von Bradke, with
our staunā́matched by (ta)sthau ná in the next vs., 6d. As often, contextual poetics
101
may have led to the choice of an enigmatic word. My own extremely speculative
interpr. (“like posts”) is that it is related to sthū́ṇā- ‘pillar’, which is well anchored in
Iranian (YAves. stū̆na-, stunā-, OP stūnā-, as well as Middle and Mod. Iranian) and
found also widely in MIA and NIA (Pā, Pkt thūṇā, etc.). This suggestion requires the
perhaps counter-intuitive assumption that the aspiration in sthū́ṇā is secondary,
perhaps based on the MIA form (where initial *st would of course develop into th);
the unmotivated retroflex ṇ in the Vedic form might give some support to that
hypothesis. And secondary (if it is secondary) association with √sthā ‘stand’ would
also encourage an aspirated initial. Another wrinkle is that it may have trisyllabic
scansion (so Gr), but that is further than I can go. For a similarly impenetrable form
in this maṇḍala with the same phonological profile, see staulā́in VI.44.7 and comm.
ad loc.
The last problem in the vs. (or at least the last one I will tackle) is in d: does
nū́cid here mean ‘even now’ or ‘never’. Ge, Re, and von Bradke opt for the latter;
Scar (405) gives a choice of both. Although these two choices seem starkly
oppositional, they may amount to the same thing with the subjunctive áva yāsat: even
now she is trying to appease them, and she never will be able to.</p>
<h3 id="vi666">VI.66.6</h3>
<p>With some relief we can pass on from the clotted vss. containing the
Maruts’ birth story to the considerably more straightforward terrain of their adult
exploits. This vs. is, however, linked to the preceding one: ugrā́ḥ in 6a picks up the
last word of 5, ugrā́n. It is also barely possible that suméke ‘well-fixed’ to √mi ‘fix,
implant’ resonates with staunā́ḥ in 5c, if that means ‘post’.
As indicated in the publ. tr., the vs. is also structured by the pun on du. ródasī
‘(two) world halves’ and nom. sg. rodasī́, the PN of the Maruts’ consort, differing
only by accent.
As noted by Old and Re, the simile marker ná is wrongly positioned, before
the simile itself: ná rókaḥ rather than expected *róko ná. Re suggests it is to avoid
vs.-final ná. But see the disc. above of 5c, with the ref. to von Bradke’s happy
observation that (ta)sthau ná here matches the hapax staunā́(ḥ) in that pāda, which
can easily account for the wrong placement here: the order was adjusted to facilitate
the inter-vs. echo. My tr. also reflects my interpr. of sváśociḥ at the end of previous
pāda as part of the postponed simile (sváśociḥ, … ná rókaḥ# “like a self-blazing
light”). Although sváśociḥ can of course modify rodasī́, to which it is adjacent,
taking it with the simile would not only put ná in expected, if distant, second
position, but also produces a more effective simile in my opinion: “like a light”
seems pretty lame, as if Rodasī was a glorified headlight, but “like a self-blazing
light” has more oomph.</p>
<h3 id="vi667">VI.66.7</h3>
<p>Both Ge and Re take pathyā̀as the obj. of sā́dhan (e.g., “… die rechten
Wege nehmend”), but since the former is regularly used, with or without ánu, to
express extent of space and since the latter can be used absolutely, I prefer my
rendering.
102</p>
<h3 id="vi668">VI.66.8</h3>
<p>In c, on the basis of VI.31.1 I would adjust the tr. to reflect the formulaic
pair toká- tánaya- to “progeny and posterity, the waters, and the sun”; see also
VI.25.4.
Flg. Ge, Re, and Klein (DGRV II.123, 194), the publ. tr. takes pā́rye … dyóḥ as
referring to a particular, decisive time or hour of the day (Klein “in the last (hour) of
the day”), but I now think it more likely that the phrase is simply a metrically driven
variant of diví (&hellip;) pā́r
i
ye / pā́r
i
ye diví# “on the decisive day,” a locution found quite
commonly in the VIth Maṇḍala (VI.17.14, 23.2, 33.5, 40.5; also pā́ri
ye áhan
VI.26.1). In pāda-final position that expression is only appropriate to Jagatī/dimeter
cadences. Re makes a similar suggestion in his comm, despite his tr. “à l’heuredécisive du jour.” I would therefore slightly emend the publ. tr. to “on the decisive
day”; sense supports this change: the act described in this pāda is more likely to be
localized to a particularly important day, not a particularly important part of the day.
On the tendency of ádha to occur adjacent to locatives, see Klein DGRV II.95.</p>
<h3 id="vi669">VI.66.9</h3>
<p>For the switch between singular reference to the Marut collectivity in ab and
plural reference to the same group in cd, see disc. ad 3cd.
A particularly insistent etym. figure in c: sáhāṃsi sáhasā sáhante. The metrical
irreg. of the pāda, with a likely rest at 5 (so HvN), after sáhāṃsi, may draw attention
to it.
On the address to Agni in d, see comm. ad 10.</p>
<h3 id="vi6610">VI.66.10</h3>
<p>The comparison of the Maruts to fires in 2a (yé agnáyo ná śóśucann
idhānā́ḥ “those who kept blazing up like fires being kindled”) returns here in the first
hemistich with more contorted imagery. In the similes of both a and b the Maruts are
compared not directly to fire, but to something that is a metaphor for fire: “the dart of
the ceremony” (a) and the more familiar “tongues of fire” (b). The somewhat
unexpected invocation of Agni in the last pāda of the preceding vs. (9d) prepares the
way for these similes.
In d I have followed Ge and Re in selecting the final word, ádhṛṣtāḥ
‘unassailable’, as the predicate. But given that the first 5 vss. of the hymn concern the
Maruts’ birth and that the 1st half of this vs. compares them to fire, I wonder if the
predicate is rather bhrā́jajjanmānaḥ ‘of flashing birth’, as von Bradke takes it: “…&hellip;
leuchtend ist die Geburt der unwiderstehlichen Marut.” The striking phonology (…j
…jj) of the cmpd certainly draws attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="vi6611">VI.66.11</h3>
<p>Note the fairly common bhrā́jad-ṛṣti- in a immediately following the
identically formed hapax bhrā́jaj-janman- in 10d.
The final pāda has attracted more concerned comment than I think it deserves;
see esp. the great fuss Old makes about it. The issue is what to do with the simile
containing two nominatives giráyo nā́paḥ (= ná ā́paḥ), lit. “like mountains, waters.”
The consensus seems to be that the two noms. convey a single image, with a more
complex structure underlying it: namely the waters (of) the mountains, mountain
water, Bergwasser. I don’t see why this is necessary; instead I think the thoughts are
103
being compared both with moutains and with waters, which are both ugrá- in
different ways. (Old allows this possibility.)
Note that the adjectives qualifying the inspired thoughts, śúci- and ugrá-, were
used of the Maruts earlier in the hymn, in 4c and 5c, 6a respectively.
VI.67 Mitra and Varuṇa</p>
<h3 id="vi671">VI.67.1</h3>
<p>The hymn does not start promisingly, with a bad, and unfixable, cadence in
pāda a (jyẽ́ṣṭhatamā). Pāda c also ends with a superlative (yámiṣṭhā), which makes a
fine cadence. Perhaps this morphological parallelism invited the deployment of the
double splv. jyẽṣṭhatamā in this unfavorable position.
Both Ge and Re predicate the infin. vāvṛdhádhyai to a supplied 1st pl. (e.g.,
“M+V … wollen wir erbauen …”), but there is no reason why the dual dvandva
mitrā́váruṇā can’t be a nom., with a passive reading of the infin., as I take it. In Re’s
case the supposed 1st ps. subj. leads him to take vaḥ as obj. (“vous les plus puissants
…”), though of course it is plural and does not match the referents in number and,
compounding the grammatical lapses, to tr. mitrā́váruṇā as voc. (“ô Varuṇa-Mitra”).
This was not Re’s finest hour. Ge manages to shift vaḥ off into an oblique role (“für
euch,” presumably referring to the human beneficiaries of the 1st ps. poet-ritualists’
activities), but absent a 1st ps. subj., vaḥ can be attached directly to the poets’ songs
used for strengthening, as in the publ. tr.
In c the grammatical identity of raśmā́(in sandhi with the simile particle
raśméva) is unclear. It is generally taken, I think correctly, to the -n-stem raśmán-,
otherwise found only in cmpds. Gr calls it an instr., and Wackernagel concurs (AiG
III.268), as does Re (clearer in the comm. [EVP VII] than in the weaselly tr. “comme
(avec) une rêne” [EVP V]). But -mā instr. to -man-stems are rare; AiG cites only the
likewise hapax drāghmā́in X.70.4. We might rather expect *raś(a)nā́or the like (cf.
mahinā́to mahimán-), and in fact such a posited form might yield the well-attested -
ā-stem raśanā́- ‘halter’ as a decasuative from the instr. (though the Iranian forms
showing this same internal vowel [see EWA s.v.] might give us pause). Ge by
contrast takes it as a nom. sg., which is grammatically impeccable as long as the stem
is masc. (Since its other two occurences are in bahuvrīhis, it is impossible to be sure,
but suffix-accented -mán-stems are in fact generally masc.; cf. AiG II.2.754.) Either
nom. or instr. would work fine in the passage; in the former case the comparison
would be to Mitra and Varuṇa as controllers; in the latter to the arms with which they
perform the controlling (bāhúbhiḥ svaíḥ). In neither case would raśmā́match the
frame in number. I have followed Ge in taking it as a nom., though I would like it to
be dual, like apásā in 3c, but this is morphologically impossible.
The verb form yamátuḥ is generally assigned to the pf. stem (Gr, Wh Rts, Kü),
though Lub lists it with the root aor., labelling it a nonce. Kü (399) derives this nonredupl. pf. by analogy to “nur scheinbar reduplikationslosem takṣathur : takṣur” to
the 3rd pl. injunc. root aor. yamur. Since there is no real semantic connection
between the two roots √yam and √takṣ, and the supposed model takṣathur is found
only once in the RV, in Maṇḍala X (as opposed to the well-established redupl. pf.
104
tatákṣa, etc.), this seems an unlikely channel. A more likely one is found in the
immediate context: the pāda ends … yamátur yámiṣṭhā, with the dual splv. “best
controllers” serving as subj. to the etymologically identical verb. In these
circumstances substituting the root syllable yam found in the splv. for the weak form
yem found in the proper dual pf. yemáthur (2x; cf. also 3rd du. yematur) would not be
surprising.</p>
<h3 id="vi672">VI.67.2</h3>
<p>The first hemistich displays a sort of contrastive ritual synesthesia. In the
first pāda an inspired thought (manīṣā́) is ‘spread forth’ (prá stṛṇīte), an action not
literally applicable to a verbal product but suitable to the barhis or ritual grass found
in b, which is not the obj. of this verb. What is going on in b is not clear until we
reach the next vs. The b pāda of 2 contains a set of apparently unconnected notions
without a unifying verb: úpa priyā́námasā barhír ácha “up to, the two dear ones (or,
with a dear one), with homage, to the ritual grass,” but the corresponding pāda in 3
pulls together this disarray: úpa priyā́námasā hūyámānā. The missing verbal action
is ‘call’, and now the two dear ones, the instrumental homage, and the barhis all
make sense. I therefore (with Ge, but not Re) supply a form of ‘call’ in 2b. And ‘call’
is more appropriate to the inspired thought of pāda a than the spreading that occurred
there. In the publ. tr. I supply a participial form modifying the inspired thought and
having active semantics, with priyā́as acc. obj. (“calling [you] two dear ones”). I
now see that it might be desirable to supply the exact form found in the next vs., the
dual pass. hūyámānā, tr. “… you two, the dear ones being called …” However, there
is a grammatical obstacle, in that vām in 2a must be a gen./dat. enclitic, not an acc.,
and therefore there is no available acc. in the structural frame of the hemistich that a
passive participle could modify. This might be finessed by taking b as a sort of
loosely connected new start. However, I prefer to stay with the publ. tr., both for the
syntactic reasons just mentioned, and because it makes the connection between the
inspired thought and the call to the gods more direct.
The nominal rel. cl. yád vāṃ varūthyàm is another ex. of an izafe-like
construction. Here, since nothing follows it but a voc., it does not appear embedded,
as many such phrases do, but it adds to the dossier of these constructions.</p>
<h3 id="vi673">VI.67.3</h3>
<p>For the connection of the first hemistich, and esp. b, with 2ab, esp. b, see
comm. on the preceding vs. Here, since Mitra and Varuṇa are subjects, the pass.
participle hūyámānā is in the nom.
The 2nd hemistich is extremely problematic. Among other things, the rel. prn.
yaú in c calls for an accented verb, but the only finite verb in the hemistich is
unaccented yatathaḥ in d; the hapax apnastháḥ in c is of unclear meaning and has an
uncertain grammatical identity; the following simile apáseva has been variously
interpr.; śrudhīyatáḥ is a hapax denominative part.; and even if all these questions are
solved, what does it all add up to?
Before addressing any of these questions directly, note several plays on the
syllable yā̆ in the early part of the hymn: 1) PREV + dual rel. pronoun in the initial
sequences sáṃ yā́(1c), sáṃ yā́v (our 3c) (as well as prá yā́[4c] and, with slight
105
transformation, pári yád [5c]); 2) dual verbs yamátuḥ (1c), yantám (2c), ā́yātam (3a),
yatathaḥ (3d). These observations set the stage for a way to reason through the
problems of this hemistich.
Let us begin with the problem of the lack of accented verb in what must be a
rel. cl. introduced by sáṃ yaú. Assuming that d, with its unaccented verb, is the main
cl. corresponding to the rel. cl. of c, which has no overt verb, there is a non-arbitrary
way to generate one: in 1c the same opening sequence sáṃ yā́(differing only in the
form of the dual rel. prn., attributable to the variation in the following initial) does
have an accented verb, pf. yamátuḥ, reinforced by the immediately flg. splv.
yámiṣṭhā, with the verb of 2c, yantám, also belonging to the root √yam. Our opening
sáṃ yaú cries out for (or at least whispers for) a similar form of √yam, and so I have
supplied it. Note that the obj. of sám … yamátuḥ in 1cd is jánān as here. (Ge [n. 3cd]
supplies náyathaḥ, on the basis of V.65.6 yuvám mitremáṃ jánaṃ, yátathaḥ sáṃ ca
nayathaḥ, also a M+V passage; this is a reasonable idea based on a good parallel, and
in some ways amounts to the same thing: he tr. “die die Menschen
zusammen(halten)” &ndash; but I prefer mine because it is generated within the hymn’s
context. Old appears to supply a form of √yat matching the one in the main cl. of d,
as does Re.)
On the question of apáseva there is now a reasonable consensus (Old, Ge, Re,
and me, but see Gr and Old for alternative views) that this represents a dual NA
apásā referring to M+V as subjects. They are therefore controlling the peoples
(jánān) as workers (or, perhaps better, work-overseers) do. But we must now
confront the hapax apnastháḥ. This is likely a cmpd of ápnas- ‘property, riches’ and
a form of √sthā. But what form? Gr, Debrunner (AiG II.2.37), and EWA (s.v.
ápnas-) assign it to a them. stem apnasthá-, which would require it to be a nom. sg.,
which ill accords with the assumed dual subj. If it is nom. sg., then apásā would be
pushed into the acc. slot, where there is no syntactic place for it, or else, with an
unenthusiastic suggestion of Old’s, it would be an instr. sg. to the neut. s-stem, for
*ápasā. Better to take it, by Old’s preferred interpr., as belonging to a root-noun
cmpd apnas-sthā́-. Under this interpr. it would be an acc. pl. This seems the least
objectionable from a contextual point of view; even though acc. pl. to root nouns in -
ā aren&rsquo;t certainly attested (see the not very helpful treatments of Lanman [Noun
Inflec. 451 and passim], Macdonell VG 253), both -as and -ās seem to be
possibilities. The 1st members of cmpds in -sthā́- generally have a locatival
relationship to their 2nd member, so ‘standing/staying in ápnas-’ is the likely
meaning. As for its function in the clause, I take it as qualifying jánān (so also Old,
though with alternatives), while Ge and Re take it as part of the simile (e.g., “&hellip; die
die Menschen zusammen(halten) wie Werkmeister die Lohnarbeiter”), and Scar, flg.
Neisser, takes it as the designation of a group of people distinct from the general
jánān but still in the frame. In the absence of other attestations of the cmpd or
underlying phrase, this cannot be decisively determined. For a detailed disc. of the
word and the passage, see Scar 645–46.
The denom. śrudhīyá- is, by most accounts (see Old, Re), but not by Ge’s (see
n. 3d), built to the 2nd sg. impv. śrudhí ‘listen!’. It is an acc. pl. part. The question is
106
what sense it is conveying. Gr glosses ‘gehorsam sein’, but since even (cid) this
group of people is put in its place by M+V with their greatness (mahitvā́), it is
unlikely that they were already obedient. Old (see also Re) suggests that it is people
who address M+V with this impv., perhaps indicating that they stand in a close or
privileged relationship with those gods. I think rather that it may refer to people
powerful enough to command obedience from other men through such peremptory
commands. They would then be similar in stature to the apnastháḥ: two sets of
people used to getting their own way (rich and demanding), who have to submit to
M+V.</p>
<h3 id="vi674">VI.67.4</h3>
<p>The birth of M+V from Aditi. This vs. is also beset with difficulties. The
major structural one is determining the interrelationships of the three subordinate
clauses, in abc, marked by yā́, yád, and yā́respectively, and their joint relationship
(or not) to the main clause in d. Once again, there are numerous competing views; I
will not rehearse them all. In my view, the three subordinate clauses are not all
parallel and semi-independent, but rather the two introduced by the dual rel. prn. yā́
(a, c) are parallel and jointly dependent on the middle cl. introduced by yád (b). In tr.
I have flipped the order of a and b in hopes of making the sense a bit more parsable. I
further think that the two forms of yā́‘which two’ have as antecedent in b the sg.
gárbham: “the embryo which was those two” or “the two as embryo.” M+V formed
one of the pairs that Aditi gave birth to serially and in that sense were a single
gárbham.
Let us then concentrate first on pāda a. Here, as in 1ab, there is an infin. in -
dhyai predicated of a god’s name, áditiḥ: “When Aditi (was) to bear.” The puzzle in
the vs. is ṛtā́, and numerous analyses have been proposed: nom. sg. fem. to normally
neut. ṛtá- ‘truth (etc.)’; short instr. sg. to the same stem; dual to the same stem; a 3rd
sg. denom. verb to the same stem (emending to *ṛtāyád from ṛtā́yád), or, the
solution I favor, as a short loc. sg. to ṛtú- ‘season’ (so Ge, though see his n. 4b), even
though -u-stems supposedly have only -au/-avi locc. (but see Lanman p. 411: “if
there is any certain instance of a L in -â, it must be regarded as due to false analogy.”
I see no problem with analogy, false or otherwise).
The two yā́clauses are nominal. The first (a) presents no problems. In the 2nd
(c) most tr. supply a verb with prá, e.g., Ge “die sich gross hervortun” (sim. Re).
However, I take jā́yamānā as a predicated pres. part. and máhi as an intensifier of
mahā́ntā.
In d the sense of the verb ní dīdhaḥ is unclear, and the lexeme ní √dhṛ is not
common. Gr glosses this passage as ‘machen’ with double acc.; Ge tr. ‘hatte …
getragen’, Re ‘avait placé en secret’. In the three other passages containing ní (ā́)
√dhṛ that I know of (IV.2.12, VI.17.6, ní-ā́VIII.17.13), the idiom means something
like ‘fix’ or ‘secure’, but here I think it applies to the process of birth: ‘bear down’.
Although I know of no other such exx., this kind of technical birth context doesn&rsquo;t
come up very often in the RV. The birth process interpr. fits well with the predicated
pres. part. of c: “who were being born” as well as with the indication in b that Aditi
had reached her precise time for giving birth.
107</p>
<h3 id="vi675">VI.67.5</h3>
<p>This vs. is refreshingly straightforward, even though the main cl. of d seems
something of an irrelevancy after the grand statements in abc.</p>
<h3 id="vi676">VI.67.6</h3>
<p>The vs. is knit together with phonological and etymological figures. Each
pāda contains a form of div/dyu: a dyū́n, b dyoḥ, c -devo, d dyā́m. Note also the
phonological similarity of the two du. verbs dhāráyethe (a), dṛṃhéthe (b), with the
latter reprised etymologically by dṛḷhó in c. Pādas b and d also rhyme.
Unlike the standard tr. I take b as part of the hí cl. beginning in a, with cd as the
main cl. Since the verb of b, dṛṃhéthe, is initial, it can owe its accent either to its
position (as most interpr. it) or to belonging to a subord. cl., as I do. Nonetheless,
there is little riding on this choice, though I would support mine by pointing out that
the fact that M+V made the back of heaven firm (b) could serve as a reason why the
sun is also firmly fixed (c).
Contra Klein (explicitly, DGRV I.379–80) and Ge/Re (implicitly), I do not
think that utá, positioned in the middle of c, conjoins b and c, but instead begins a
new cl., which continues through d.
With Ge (and, judging from his tr., Re), I divide dhāsínāyóḥ into dhāsínā ayóḥ,
with the gen.-loc. du. of ayám, not āyóḥ, gen.-abl. sg. of āyú- with the Pp.</p>
<h3 id="vi677">VI.67.7</h3>
<p>Ge follows Sāy. in interpr. this vs. as referring to rain and river waters.
Although this would accord better with the enigmatic gush (dhāsí-) of 6d, it doesn’t
fit the vocabulary or apparent sense of this enigmatic vs. The best clue we have is
pāda a, where “to fill the belly” (jaṭháram pṛṇádhyai) belongs to a phrase for
drinking soma to satiation (cf. nearby VI.69.7 and V.34.2, X.104.2, as well as other
locutions involving soma and the belly). (Both Old and Re also take the pāda as
referring to soma.) Once the poet has established the soma context with this
reasonably clear phraseology, he can (and does) treat the subject in a more obscure
fashion.
In b and c I take the feminine plurals sábhṛtayaḥ ‘of the same rearing /
pedigree’ and yuvatáyò ’vātāḥ ‘unsurpassable maidens’ as referring to the fingers (of
the priests) that press the soma. Such locutions, referring to the shared kinship of the
fingers (because they belong to the same hand), are frequent in the IXth Maṇḍala and
the forms are always feminine. I am tolerably certain of the second identification,
since the action ascribed to them in pāda d, distributing their “milk,” would be a
reasonable way (given the tropes of soma preparation) to characterize the work of the
pressing fingers. I am less certain about the identification in b, because “fill the seat”
(sádma … pṛṇánti) is not as easy to connect with soma preparation. “Seat” could
refer, inter alia, to the ritual ground or the cosmos &ndash; both are attested &ndash; but neither is
generally flooded with soma. sábhṛti- is a hapax, so it does not help identify the
referent. So the sense of pāda b remains in doubt for me.
Note another ex. of a -dhyai infinitive, though this time not as the predicated
substitute for a main verb.
108</p>
<h3 id="vi678">VI.67.8</h3>
<p>Pāda a lacks a verb; on its structure and on the grammatical interpr. of
sumedhā́(ḥ), see esp. Old. Since it is likely that sumedhā́(ḥ) is a nom. sg., referring to
Agni, this slots the du. tā́into the acc., and we need a verb to link the two. Though
Old’s ‘lead’ is possible, I follow Ge(/Re) in supplying ‘call’, since this connects this
ritual vs. with those in the earlier parts of the hymn (2ab, 3ab; see publ. intro. and
comm. ad locc.). As is generally recognized, the referent of the nom. is Agni;
III.57.5, adduced by Old, makes this quite clear: yā́te jihvā́madhumatī́sumedhā́,
ágne …
The word aratí- ‘spoked wheel’ in b is another word regularly applied to Agni.
This pāda also contains, by most interpr., two words associated with truth, satyá-,
modifying aratí-, and ṛtá-, but these interpr. are hard-pressed to come up with a
convincing interpr. of the loc. ṛté. By contrast, I interpr. it as I do the similarly
structured II.29.4 mā́vo ráthaḥ … ṛté bhūt, where, with Re, I take ṛté as the
postposition ‘without’, construed with a pronominal enclitic in 2nd position: “Let
(our) chariot not come to be without you.” See comm. ad loc. In the passage here I
assume that the absence of M+V at the ritual ground induces Agni to call them with
his tongue (=crackling). This interpr. also fits with the rivalry vss. to follow (9–11):
if M+V are not here, where are they? Probably at the sacrifice of a competitor. In the
comm. to II.29.4 I consider an alternative interpr. with ṛté the loc. of ṛtá- ‘truth’. If I
were to do so here, the passage could mean “when the spoked wheel (of the sacrifice)
[=Agni] has come into existence / has been realized for you at/in the truth [=the
sacrifice or place of sacrifice?].” I still prefer the publ. solution.
On (vi) cayiṣṭam see Hoffmann, Aufs. II.367.
VI.67.9–11: As noted in the publ. intro., these vss. seem to concern themselves with
rival sacrificers.</p>
<h3 id="vi679">VI.67.9</h3>
<p>The first half of this vs. is fairly straightforward; the problems arise in the
2nd hemistich, primarily because of ápi
yaḥ in d. The first hemistich describes the
behavior of the contentious and impious rivals, while the 2nd defines such people as
outside the normal categories of beings. Pāda c asserts clearly that those who don’t
attend upon the sacrifice are neither gods nor men, and in d they are compared
instead to ápi
yaḥ … putrā́ḥ, which is universally tr. as “like the sons of the watery
female” (e.g., Ge “wie die Söhne der Wasserfrau”). Not only does this make no
obvious (or unobvious) sense, but the morphology is essentially impossible: it is very
difficult to get ápi
yaḥ to be either the gen. sg. of a fem. -ī-stem or the nom. pl. m. of
an adj. See the rather despairing assessments of Ge (n. 9d), Debrunner (AiG
II.2.401), and esp. Scar (592 n. 841). Desperate situations require desperate
measures, and I therefore part company with the consensus interpr. of ápi
yaḥ and
suggest an entirely different derivation &ndash; as a negated root noun cmpd to the seṭ form
of the ‘swell’ root √pī. We should expect a root-accented *a-pī́-, with nom. pl.
*apíyaḥ, but I would suggest that this unclear hapax would have been attracted to the
reasonably well-attested ‘watery’ stem ápi
ya- and the accent retracted. As for
meaning, I suggest that ‘not swelling/swollen’ means ‘not growing / thriving’, and in
109
reference to children to stunted or underdeveloped ones, afflicted by what is now
called “failure to thrive” in pediatric medicine. Note that the aniṭ form of the ‘swell’
root makes a negated root-noun cmpd apít- in VII.82.3 ápinvatam apítaḥ “you two
made the unswollen (waters) swell.”
The publ. tr. does not represent the rel. prn. yé in c but treats all of cd as the
main cl. corresponding to the subord. clauses of ab. I do not know an easy way to do
this, but might suggest an alternative tr. of cd as “those not attending on the sacrifice
who are neither gods … nor mortals are like children …”</p>
<h3 id="vi6710">VI.67.10</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take the first hemistich here as a continuation of the description
of bad ritual behavior, with cd introducing our contrastively correct practice. I think
rather that the whole of 10 describes this good behavior. One advantage of this
interpr. is that it allows ā́d opening c to have its normal sense ‘after that’, which
Klein (DGRV II.135–36) must explicitly deny it. By my interpr. the first pāda sets
the ritual scene, with the various priestly speakers “distributing” the types of ritual
speech, as is standard in Vedic ritual. Some of these speakers recite the Nivids, the
formal invocations. After this “we” take over by speaking ukthá-.
On kīstá- ‘praiser’ see comm. ad I.127.7. I see no evidence for Re’s ‘mauvaisprêtres’ beyond his contextual assumptions.
The interpr. of ab as referring to bad practice turns on the part. manānā́ḥ, which
most take as meaning ‘(falsely) considering X as Y’ (e.g., Ge “was sie für
Einladungssprüche halten”), but no evidence is presented that this should be the
meaning of this root aor. part., the only occurrence of the participial stem. Most other
forms of this medial root aor. (mostly attested in the subjunctive) have a positive
sense: ‘bring to mind’, ‘conceive’, ‘ponder’, etc. The publ. tr. has ‘pay heed to’, but
any of the other suggested tr. just given would work as well, while ‘(falsely)
consider’ has no support in this stem.
Pāda d is syntactically problematic. The last two words (yatatho mahitvā́) are
identical to the ending of 3d and appear to sketch a ring and a return to the focus on
M+V’s ability to put human beings in order. Because of this salient repetition, I am
reluctant to ascribe an entire different sense to this phrase in this vs. than in 3, as
both Ge and Re do, with both also unacceptably stretching the meaning of the verb
form. In order to take d as a single cl., they must also treat nákiḥ as a simple neg.
rather than in its usual meaning ‘no one’, since the verb yatathaḥ is 2nd du. and
cannot take ‘no one’ as subject. In order to avoid this problem, I create problems of
my own. I take nákiḥ as a radically truncated sentence “No one …” This is based on
the observation that one of the most common contexts in which nákis appears is as
subj. of minat (etc.) ‘violate(s)’ (cf., e.g., I.69.7, IV.30.23, VI.30.2, etc.). I therefore
suggest that nákiḥ here is an implicit response to the description of the behavior of
bad rivals in 9b priyā́dhā́ma yuvádhitā minánti “they violate the dear ordinances
ordained by you”. Here in our ritual “no one” performs such violation. With nákis
out of the way, the rest of the pāda can be harmonized with the use of yatatho
mahitvā́in 3d. There M+V ‘set in place’ various peoples (jánān). Here I would resupply jánān and take devébhiḥ as an instr. of accompaniment: M+V set in place the
110
peoples along with the gods. I would prefer not to have to impose such a radical
analysis on this pāda, but I find other analyses even more unsatisfactory.</p>
<h3 id="vi6711">VI.67.11</h3>
<p>The first hemistich lacks a verb, but something like ‘we seek’ is a
reasonable bet, to govern áskṛdhoyu ‘not stunted’, which elsewhere modifies
‘wealth’ (VI.22.3) and ‘treasure-conferral’ (VII.53.3), hence my ‘giving’.
Ge produces an elaborate interpr. of cd as a portrayal of battle: ‘cows’ = bow
string, ‘straight-flying one’ = arrow. Although such tropes would be at home in other
parts of the RV, I see no martial context in this hymn that would encourage such a
reading. Better to interpr. the hemistich within a ritual context, since this has been
prominent in the hymn. The cows can, as so often, be the milk meant to be mixed
with the soma; the ‘straight-flying one’ (ṛjipyá-, on which see comm. ad IV.27.4) can
be the soma, or, as in IV.27.4, the falcon that carried the soma, and the bull in d is
also the soma. Re follows Ge’s battle interpr., though (in his comm.) he also sees it
overlaid with soma imagery.
VI.68 Indra and Varuṇa
Pace Old, I do not think this consists of two (much less three) hymns, with 1–8
forming one, 9–11, or 9, 10–11, one or two more. As indicated in the publ. intro., the
last three vss. focus on the ritual here-and-now, but this topic-switch from praise and
request to ritual exhortation is easily accommodated within the same hymn. That 9–
10 are in Jagatī in contrast to the Triṣṭubh in the rest of the hymn is not sufficient to
signal a hymn break, esp. since 9–10 doesn’t match either of Old’s suggested
groupings.</p>
<h3 id="vi681">VI.68.1</h3>
<p>The opening of this hymn has some features in common with the opening of
the last one (VI.67.1), and of course both hymns are dedicated to dual divinities, with
Varuṇa shared. The 1st hemistich of each ends with a -dhyai infinitive; the 1st pāda
has a 2nd ps. enclitic in 2nd position (vaḥ, vām respectively), and the 2nd hemistich
begins PREV yá- (yā́, yáḥ respectively). However the hymns unfold very differently.
Ge takes sajóṣā(ḥ) at the end of pāda a as an “erstarrter Kasus oder Hypallage”
(n. 1a) referring to I+V. But grammatically it should modify yajñáḥ, and there is no
semantic obstacle to taking it thus. Re agrees, and further remarks that, since sajóṣasregularly takes an instr., it is tempting to construe it with śruṣtī́— a temptation he
resists and I have succombed to.
I take the gen./abl. vṛktábarhiṣaḥ as the oblique subject of the inf. yájadhyai,
rather than predicating that inf. to cognate yajñáḥ —though the latter construction
(reflected in Ge and Re, insofar as I can untangle their clotted syntax) is not
impossible: “This sacrifice of the one who has twisted the ritual grass, raised up, is to
be sacrificed to you …”</p>
<h3 id="vi682">VI.68.2</h3>
<p>Although the vs. is addressed to both gods, Indraic qualities predominate:
śáviṣṭha- almost always qualifies Indra, who is regularly called a śū́ra-; maghávanis of course a standing epithet of his, and the splv. máṃhiṣṭha- frequently modifies
111
him; both tuviśúṣma- (3x) and sárvasena- (3x) are otherwise only used of Indra; and
vṛtratúr- encapsulates Indra’s signature deed. Only ṛténā falls in Varuṇa’s domain.
I do not understand the position of tā́hí, though 1) hí sometimes takes
immediate pre-verbal position even deep in the clause, and 2) the heavy NP śū́rāṇāṃ
śáviṣṭhā (with the first word having quadrisyllabic scansion) would not fit metrically
in a putative pāda #tā́hí śū́rāṇāṃ śáviṣṭhā bhūtam.</p>
<h3 id="vi683">VI.68.3</h3>
<p>This is the only vs. in the hymn that clearly disjoins the two gods and
describes each by his own qualities (though see comm. ad 8–9) &ndash; though as Re
points out, the description of Varuṇa in d is somewhat obscure. I take it to refer to
Varuṇa’s ritual activity, as against Indra’s warrior exploits.
Although śúṣma- (2c) and śūṣá- (3a) are not etymologically related, their
phonological similarity associates them, and they are positioned identically in these
two vss. See also the śū́rāṇāṃ śáviṣṭhā figure in 2b and śávasā in 3c: there is an
abundance of śu/ū / śav forms.
On the constr. of cakānā́see Kü (142–43 and n. 132), who rejects Ge’s passive
interpr.</p>
<h3 id="vi684">VI.68.4</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., it is quite rare to present the collectivity of gods
as subdivided into female and male divinities. I’m not sure why this context has
evoked it.
As Re notes in passing, the 1st hemistich contains two forms of nṛ́- ‘man’ in
different usage. The first (náraḥ) is contrasted with gnā́ḥ, as male to female, and
identifies these náraḥ as gods; the 2nd (narā́m) appears to refer to the mortal poets as
superior men and agents of the praise of the gods. For this putative gen. agent,
compare the similar constr. with the same ppl. at I.122.10 narā́ṃ gūrtáśravaḥ “whose
fame is sung by men” (and cf. also I.180.8 narā́m &hellip; práśastaḥ).
In 2 of its 4 occurrences svágūrta- modifies rivers and can reasonably be
rendered ‘self-praised’ because rivers generate their own noise (gurgling), which can
be conceptually configured as praise. But in our passage it seems unlikely that the
gods are praising themselves (pace Ge). In IV.19.10 the adj. modifies ápāṃsi, Indra’s
‘labors’, and there I tr. “welcomed for themselves’, since labors don’t have the
capacity to praise themselves. I suggest the word in this passage has a similar sense,
even though, as animate beings, gods could praise themselves. But I think the point is
that, though the All Gods are going to take second place after I+V in pāda c, the poet
acknowledges that they deserve some praise of their own. -gūrta- picks up
etymologically related gṛṇīhi ‘sing!’ in 3a, with gṛṇānā́(8a), gṛṇántaḥ (8c)
continuing the lexical chain.
Pāda d contains a reverse Vāyav Indraś ca construction, dyaúś ca pṛthivi. The
introduction and invocation of Heaven and Earth seems a little odd in a hymn
celebrating Indra and Varuṇa, and the sense of the pāda is somewhat unclear. See
Old’s disc. The pāda seems to indicate that Heaven and Earth stand out from the
other All Gods just as much as Indra and Varuṇa do, an elevation of gods other than
the addressees of the hymn that deviates from standard RVic practice. The structure
112
of the hemistich, with instr. mahitvā́ending c and expressing the quality by which
I+V are preeminent, invites us to take pāda-final urvī́as a similar instr. of an abstract
‘width, breadth’, rather than the usual fem. du. NA. This would yield “you stand out
from them by your greatness, o Indra and Varuṇa, (as) do you two, o Heaven and
Earth, by your breadth.” Although such an abstract urvī́- does not otherwise exist, I
am still tempted to assume that this was the intent of the passage: giving a wellknown measure of superiority (the width of H+E) as a standard by which to judge
that of I+V.</p>
<h3 id="vi685">VI.68.5</h3>
<p>Several minor sound plays in the vs.: dā́śati (b) / dā́svān (c); iṣā́sá dviṣā́s.</p>
<h3 id="vi686">VI.68.6</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. failed to render devā; insert “O gods” at the beg. of the vs.</p>
<h3 id="vi687">VI.68.7</h3>
<p>It is difficult to render the comparative of sutrātará- without awkwardness,
and so I have not attempted to do so.
Note the etymological and phonological figure tiráte táturiḥ. The cadence is
bad, and it would be better to read *tatūriḥ. Of the 5 occurrences of this stem, this
reading would be preferable also in IV.39.2 and probably VI.24.2, but dispreferred in
I.145.3 and VI.22.2. The 4 occurrences of the similarly formed pápuri- are always
metrically better with a light root syllable.</p>
<h3 id="vi688">VI.68.8</h3>
<p>Ge (n. 8c) claims that this pāda applies only to Indra, but this is not entirely
evident to me. It is true that VI.33.5c, adduced by Ge, is almost identical (itthā́
gṛṇánto mahínasya śárman) and refers to Indra, and it is also true that śárdhas-
‘force’ regularly refers to the Marut troop, Indra’s regular associates, and could (but
need not) here. However, the context still does not seem to me sufficiently
diagnostic.
VI.68.9–11: On the annunciatory forms of ayám in these three vss., see publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="vi689">VI.68.9</h3>
<p>Ge also (n. 8c) claims (fld. by Re) that this vs. is entirely Varuṇa’s. This is
more plausible: he is mentioned by name in b, and máhivrataḥ ‘having great
commandments’in c makes it likely that the clause in cd has Varuṇa as subject —
though note that máhivrata- is used of Varuṇa only here, with two occurrences each
of Agni and Soma, and moreover dhṛtavratā is addressed to both gods in the next vs.
(10b). Nonetheless, samrā́j- in pāda a is used frequently of Indra as well as of
Varuṇa, so the 1st hemistich may (and probably does) contain a exhortation to the
poet to chant both to Indra (as sovereign king) and Varuṇa. The publ. tr. could make
this clearer if ‘and’ replaced the comma: “to the lofty sovereign king (and) to the god
Varuṇa”</p>
<h3 id="vi6811">VI.68.11</h3>
<p>The 2nd pāda has a rather insistent but elementary phonetic/etymological
figure: vṛ́ṣṇaḥ … vṛṣanā́vṛṣethām, and the last word of the vs. mādayethām resonates
with the long adj. qualifying soma in the 1st pāda, mádhumattamasya.

VI.69 Indra and Viṣṇu
Re’s treatment is in EVP XV.43–46. He claims that the “thème indraique”
dominates, though I find the hymn’s phraseology so bland that it’s difficult to assign
qualities and deeds to one or the other, and in fact the most salient action in the
hymn, the wide-striding of vs. 5, is Viṣṇu’s characteristic deed. See further in the
publ. intro.
The hymn is (in my view) repetitive and pedestrian, with only a few striking
images and phraseological tricks. This strikes me as an indication that the poet was
“phoning it in” &ndash; the composition of the hymn does not seem to have commanded his
full attention. The question might then arise why the hymn was preserved in the
Saṃhitā. This might be partially due to the rarity of Indra-Viṣṇu hymns (only the
first three vss. of I.155 and the middle three vss. of VII.99 &ndash; so this is the only hymn
entirely dedicated to both) and in fact of Viṣṇu hymns in general. As Viṣṇu, a fairly
recessive god in the RV, began to come to prominence in the post-RVic period, the
assemblers of the RV collection may have gathered what scraps they could and
exercised less critical judgment than usual in order to create a place in the text for
this newly important deity. The O’Henry-type ending, sprung by the final vs. (8),
might also account for its preservation.</p>
<h3 id="vi691">VI.69.1</h3>
<p>Acdg. to Re, kárman- is esp. associated with Indra, íṣ- with Viṣṇu, but I see
no clear evidence of this.
pārá- ‘far shore’ and pāráya- ‘cause to cross [to the far shore]’ are of course
etymologically related, and here they express allied notions: just as we cause Indra
and Viṣṇu to reach the ‘far shore’ of their labor, so do they cause us to cross
something unspecified, but quite possibly the reference is to completing the ritual.</p>
<h3 id="vi692">VI.69.2</h3>
<p>It is striking &ndash; and perhaps a little insulting &ndash; to refer to the gods Indra and
Viṣṇu as soma-holding tubs, though of course once they have drunk the soma, that is
what, in effect, they are. This image recurs in 6d.
The two heavy pres. passive participles śasyámānāḥ and gīyámānāsaḥ seem
meant to convey that the sacrifice is currently ongoing, hence my “as they are being
…”
In d arkaíḥ is taken by Ge and Re as referring to the chants of the sacrifice, and
in the context of recitation and singing this sense is clearly the principal one. Both Ge
and Re interpr. the instr. as meaning “in the form of,” and I have followed them in
the publ. tr. &ndash; though an instr. of accompaniment “along with chants” would also be
possible. I further think the word is a pun, with the secondary sense “along with the
rays (of the sun)” as often (e.g., VI.4.6). This would be a temporal designation of
dawn, when the sacrifice is taking place. That the next vs. contains a similar pun (in
my view) supports such an interpr. here.</p>
<h3 id="vi693">VI.69.3</h3>
<p>dráviṇo dádhānā in b is essentially the same VP as dráviṇam … dhattam in
1c. I do not know why the s-stem drávinas- was substituted for the thematic
114
dráviṇa-, esp. as the acc. of the latter, dráviṇam, would fit the meter just as well. The
first VP, dráviṇaṃ dhattam, reappears in 6c.
There are other echoes of previous vss.: 3cd sáṃ vām … sám repeats 1a, and
matīnā́m in c both repeats the same word in the same metrical position in 2a and
anticipates it in 4c.
The 2nd half of this vs. is structured like that of vs. 2, esp. pāda d, where both 2d
and 3d have the form PREV stómāsaḥ PRES.PASS.PART. INSTR.(‘song’)-aiḥ. The instr.
could, as in the previous vs., express accompaniment.
As in 2, I see a pun here: because of the etym. figure añjantv aktúbhiḥ “let them
anoint with ointments,” the principal sense of aktú- must be ‘ointment’, here
metaphorical for the “ointments of thoughts.” But instr. aktúbhiḥ often means
‘through the nights’, as in the phrase dyúbhir aktúbhiḥ “through the days and the
nights” (e.g., I.112.25), and I see this temporal sense here as well.</p>
<h3 id="vi694">VI.69.4</h3>
<p>As just noted, matī́nām occurs here for the 3rd time, while juṣéthām is
repeated from 1c.</p>
<h3 id="vi695">VI.69.5</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., both gods are credited with wide striding (b),
although this is normally only Viṣṇu’s act. The cosmogonic opening out of the
spaces in the more vaguely phrased 2nd hemistich can be applied to Indra, however.</p>
<h3 id="vi696">VI.69.6</h3>
<p>The image of the gods as soma-holding tubs returns here in d, but this time
it is mediated through the image of them as the sea (samudráḥ) and therefore
couched in the singular.
The d pāda is a repetition of 4d, save for the substitution of hávam for gíraḥ.
Such verbatim repetition of a full pāda within a hymn is very rare (save for refrains)
and relatively rare even between two hymn &ndash; again, in my view, an indication that
the poet was not feeling particularly inspired.</p>
<h3 id="vi697">VI.69.7</h3>
<p>In ab Ge honors the pāda break and construes sómasya with jaṭháram
pṛṇethām. But we might expect an instr. sómena in that case (as in V.34.2), and the
enjambment envisioned here is very mild.</p>
<h3 id="vi698">VI.69.8</h3>
<p>On the surprise ending here and the splitting up of what was throughout the
rest of the hymn an indissoluble pair, see publ. intro. The first pāda keeps the two as
a pair, with dual verbs jigyathuḥ and jayethe asserting that both won and both did not
lose the contest. The audience would first take this as meaning they did not lose to
their (joint) opponent. But in b we have the first splitting of the pair into two
(implied) singulars (ná … katarás canaínoḥ “neither one of these two”), which could
raise the possibility that they were contending with each other &ndash; but paradoxically
neither one lost. Their mutual contention is then made explicit in pāda c, with, inter
alia, a reverse Vāyav Indraś ca construction (índraś ca viṣṇo) serving as the subj. of a
dual verb (ápasṛdhethām), which in the middle voice refers to mutual conflict, and
the final pāda explains (or implies) how in such a situation neither one lost: the 1000
115
(cows) were split into three parts, and as later Vedic texts indicate, Indra got twothirds and Viṣṇu one-third. It may be that the reversal of the Vāyav Indraś ca
construction, which puts índraḥ in first position, also signals his relative, but not
complete, dominance in this story.
VI.70 Heaven and Earth
Re XVP.121ff.
VI.70.1–2: As noted in the publ. intro., the focus here is on the various liquids
associated with Heaven and Earth and their sheer moisture. Vs. 1 has ghee, honey,
milk (by implication, in the compd. madhu-dúghe), and semen; in vs. 2 they are said
never to dry up (ásaścantī) and possess streams, milk, ghee, and semen. The cmpd.
madhu-dúgha- ‘milking out honey’ in 1b is reprised by the VP ghṛtáṃ duhāte in 2b
(with a diff. obj.). Another responsion is bhúvanānām ‘creatures’ (1a) and (asyá)
bhúvanasya ‘(this) creation’ in 2c.</p>
<h3 id="vi701">VI.70.1</h3>
<p>pṛthvī́here (and in the same phrase in 4c) is of course a blindingly obvious
pun: though used as an adj. here (‘broad’) it is of course (almost) identical to the
standard word for ‘earth’, found in the dual dvandva dyā́vā-pṛthivī́in the next pāda
(also 4a, 5a). By an accident of grammar, the nom./acc. dual fem. (in pṛthvī́, here
modifying the dual dvandva) and the nom. singular. fem. pṛthivī́‘earth’ have the
same ending -ī́. This grammatical pun is only actualized fully in the final vs. of the
hymn, where we get the conjoined singular NP dyaúś ca pṛthivī́ca.</p>
<h3 id="vi703">VI.70.3</h3>
<p>On the double etym. figure prá prajā́bhir jāyate, see comm. ad VIII.27.16.
With Re I take dhármaṇas pári with a full lexical sense of each element, rather
than, with Ge, as a weakened adverbial “pflichtgemäss” (dutifully). Heaven and
Earth provide the physical foundation (dhárman-) starting from which the pious man
can found his family line, just as Heaven and Earth themselves took their places
(apart) according to the dhárman- of Varuṇa in 1c.
The abundant references to real liquids in vss. 1–2 find their metaphorical
expression in the creatures ‘poured out’ (siktā́) from Heaven and Earth (d). This ppl.
picks up the imperative rétaḥ siñcatam “pour the semen” addressed to H+E in 2d.
However, I take the implicit subj. of siktā́to be bhúvanā ‘creatures’ vel sim. (see 1a),
not, with Gr, rétāṃsi ‘semens’. prajā́ḥ ‘progeny, offspring’ from the previous pāda
would also be possible; it would only require altering the Pp reading siktā́to fem. pl.
siktā́ḥ, but no alteration to the Saṃhitā text.
My “poured out from you” of course tacitly misrepresents the case of dual
yuvóḥ, which must be gen.-loc., not abl. But it’s worth noting that the 2nd du abl.
yuvát is attested only once in the RV, and I take yuvóḥ as an ex. of the all-purpose
genitive: poured out from you and hence yours.
The explicitly contrastive víṣurūpāṇi sávratā reminds us of the phrase in the
Yama/Yamī hymn X.10.2, sálakṣmā … víṣurūpā, describing Yamī compared to
Yama: “having the same marks, but dissimilar form.”
116
VI.70.4–5: These two vss., concerning ghee and honey respectively, have similarly
structured 1st halves: a case form of the substance opens the vs. (4a ghṛténa, 5a
mádhu), while the 2nd pāda consists of three 3 cmpds in the dual with the substance as
1st member. The 2nd members do not repeat (ghṛta-śríyā ghṛta-pṛ́cā ghṛtā-vṛ́dhā;
madhu-ścútā madhu-dúghe mádhu-vrate), but only the last two are not root noun
cmpds.</p>
<h3 id="vi704">VI.70.4</h3>
<p>The ghee vs., with four instances in the 1st hemistich, echoing in the first
word of the hymn ghṛtávatī. There is also some recycling and remixing of vocab.: 1a
abhiśríyā : 4ab abhī́-vṛte ghṛta-śríyā, as well as outright repetition: 1b / 4c urvī́
pṛthvī́.
The third pāda contains a ritual pun, “set in front at the choosing of the Hotar
priest” (hotṛvū́rye puróhite): purohité here modifies H+E, but ordinarily it is the
Hotar priest himself who is “set in front.”</p>
<h3 id="vi705">VI.70.5</h3>
<p>In b madhudúghe reprises the same word in the same metrical position in
1b.
What ‘having honeyed commandments’ refers to is not clear to me; it is a hapax
and picks up similarly pāda-final śúci-vrate ‘of pure commandments’ (2b) and
sávratā ‘having the same commandments’ (3d).
I configure cd slightly differently from the standard, which takes yajñáṃ
dráviṇaṃ ca as what H+E establish for the gods and the misc. acc. in d as what they
do for us. My interpr. is informed by two passages in the immediately preceding
hymn: VI.69.1 juṣéthāṃ yajñáṃ dráviṇaṃ ca dhattam “enjoy the sacrifice and confer
wealth” and VI.69.6 dráviṇam dhattam asmé “confer wealth on us.” In both passages
dráviṇam is implicitly or explicitly meant for us, while in the 1st yajñám is meant for
the gods to enjoy. This matches the use of dráviṇa- elsewhere: it’s what mortals want
and gods confer on them. I therefore construe dráviṇam as the first member of the
complex NP to be taken with asmé in d (dráviṇaṃ ca … máhi śrávo vā́jam …
suvī́ryam. Ge (n. 5c) recognizes the problem but chooses to go with the pāda
division. My interpr. has the further advantage of not having to take devátā as an
honorary dative, but rather with the instr. value that it should have.</p>
<h3 id="vi706">VI.70.6</h3>
<p>On the grammatical pun that accounts for the disjoining of the dual dvandva
dyā́vā-pṛthivī́, see comm. ad vs. 1. This disjoining is somewhat reminiscent of the
same move in the previous hymn, where the dvandva índrā-víṣṇū appears in every
vs. except the last, where not only are the two gods separated (índraś ca viṣṇo), but
contend with each other. There is no contention here, but the grammatical shift is the
same.</p>
<h2 id="vi71-savitar">VI.71 Savitar</h2>
<p>Re EVP XV.26ff. On the division into two hymns, see publ. intro., as well as
Old and Ge (both minimally).
117</p>
<h3 id="vi711">VI.71.1</h3>
<p>I take the locatival expression rájaso vídharmaṇi as expressing a verbal
notion “in/at his speading apart …,” rather than as marking a location like Ge (“im
Zwischenreich des Raumes”). In this I am in general agreement with Re, who calls it
a “semi-infinitif,” a typical Re evasion, though I am sympathetic to it here.</p>
<h3 id="vi712">VI.71.2</h3>
<p>The -mani form vídharmaṇi ending 1d prepares the way for a 2nd such
expression, savitúḥ sávimani, though with a subjective, not objective gen. The
parallelism might be better expressed in tr. by “at the best impelling of …” This
locatival (semi-)infinitive is then explicitly conjoined with a datival one: váśunaś ca
dāváne “for the giving of goods.” On the lack of parallelism see Klein DGRV I.94.
Somewhere between the 1st vs. and the last pāda of vs. 2 Savitar’s reference
changes from 3rd (clear in the 3rd ps. verbs of which he is subj. in 1b, c ayaṃsta and
pruṣṇute) to 2nd (clear in 2nd sg. ási in 2d). This verb makes it clear that the reference
in the whole rel. cl. of cd must be 2nd ps., but in the main cl. of ab devásya … savitúḥ
could be either 3rd or 2nd &ndash; a typical modulation tactic in the RV.
In both hemistichs the construction of the (semi-)predicated (semi-)infinitives is
abrupt. In each case there’s a form of the verb ‘to be’ (syāma b, ási d) with loc. (and
in b dat.) infinitivals. For ease of parsing I have supplied “(there)” and “(busy)”
respectively.</p>
<h3 id="vi713">VI.71.3</h3>
<p>On īśata see comm. ad I.23.9.</p>
<h3 id="vi714">VI.71.4</h3>
<p>On the almost identical first pādas of the 1st and 2nd hymns of this composite,
see publ. intro. In addition to the exact repetitions of the a-pādas, note that both 1 and
4 have a verbal expression from the sū root that gives Savitar his name: 1b sávanāya
and 4d suvati. This vs. also recycles and remixes some of the vocab. from the final
vs. of the preceding hymn, 3: 3c híraṇya-jihvaḥ gets redistributed into 4b híraṇyapāṇiḥ and 4c mandrá-jihvaḥ, and a further X-body part bahuvrīhi, áyo-hanuḥ, is
added.</p>
<h3 id="vi715">VI.71.5</h3>
<p>This vs. continues variations on vs. 1. Like 4a it begins úd u (or in this case
ū). The VP in 1ab hiraṇyáyā, bāhū́ayaṃsta is almost entirely matched by 5ab áyān
… bāhū́, hiraṇyáyā with exactly reverse order and act. verb rather than middle.
The publ. tr. follows the attractive suggestion of Re concerning ábhvam
‘formless’, that it refers to the wind. That the wind tends to drop at evening provides
some support for this interpr. I would further suggest that the cid in the phrase kác
cid ábhvam is doing double duty: expressing both ‘(what)ever’ and ‘even’.</p>
<h3 id="vi716">VI.71.6</h3>
<p>In c I accept the emendation of kṣáyasya to *kṣáyasi, which goes back to
Aufrecht (see Old, Ge, Re, all of whom accept it; against this tide is Scar 353–54,
though he doesn’t even note the general view). Inter alia, it provides an accented
verb for the hí in pāda c; syāma in d is unaccented and should therefore not be
construed with the previous pāda.
118
VI.72 Indra and Soma
Re’s brief comments are found in EVP XVI.108–9. His assessment &ndash; “banal” &ndash;
is spot on. For the structure of the hymn, see publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="vi721">VI.72.1</h3>
<p>The pleonastic máhi … mahitvám “great greatness” may be in service of
phonological play: máhi tád vām is echoed in abbreviated form by immediately
following mahitvám.
The (near?) synonyms sū́ryam and svàr are found as the obj. of the same verb
vividáthuḥ in c. I have followed Lü (191) in tr. the first as ‘sun’ and the 2nd as
‘sunlight’ (“Sonne … Sonnenlicht”), which is almost the same as Ge’s “Sonne …
Himmelslicht,” but preserves the lexical similarity better. Re prefers ‘ciel’. The verb
is accented because it stands between its two predicates and thus implicitly serves
two clauses.</p>
<h3 id="vi722">VI.72.2</h3>
<p>Here the verb in a, vāsáyathaḥ, is accented because it follows the
extrasentential voc. índrāsomā and therefore effectively begins the vs.
The first hemistich describes dawn and the sunrise in the pres. tense as repeated
daily events. The 2nd hemistich by contrast recounts the original separation of Heaven
and Earth. The 2nd verb in this hemistich, the augmented impf. áprathatam (d),
clearly locates the action in the past. The previous verb, skambháthuḥ (c), is formally
anomalous. It is generally identified as a non-reduplicated pf. (so explicitly Gr; listed
with the pf. by Whitney [Roots], Macdonell [VGS]; by implication Re) because of its
clear 3rd du. pf. ending. But in addition to its lack of redupl., its full-gr. root syllable
is unexpected. Kü treats the form in some detail (574), both functionally and
formally. Since in the end he decides it is not built to the pf. stem, he begins by
trying to deny that it has past value, despite the following augmented impf.,
suggesting rather that it can have “generell-zeitlos” sense. This (in his view) opens
the door to taking it as an injunctive, probably to a root aorist. It then owes its pf.-
type ending to analogic spread from the equally non-reduplicated 3rd pl. skambhur
(X.65.4), whose ending could belong to the pf. or, possibly, to an aorist. Since the
conceptual structure of the vs., with the actions of ab contrasting with those of cd,
imposes (in my view) a preterital sense on skambháthuḥ, I am not persuaded by Kü’s
general/timeless interpr. But, on the other hand, I don’t need to be: Kü is still under
the sway of the Hoffmannian interpr. of the injunctive, but this straitjacket of a
linguistically implausible verbal “category” should not limit our readings of this
maximally unmarked form-type, and there is, in my view, abundant evidence for
injunctives used as straight preterites. I am therefore willing to accept that
skambháthuḥ (and skambhuḥ) somehow reflect an aorist, which the root otherwise
lacks, and a root aorist might be expected beside the nasal pres. skabhnā́ti, as Kü
points out. He provides what seems to me an overly complex analogic explanation
for the full-grade root syllable, which can simply result from a formal match with the
immediately following cognate instr. skámbhanena. (It might be noted that a putative
*skabháthuḥ with zero-grade root syllable would produce a slightly better break.)
119
What I don’t understand &ndash; and Kü doesn’t mention &ndash; is why the verb is accented. It
is right in the middle of its clause, preceded by a tonic preverb and a tonic object, so
the explanations for the accents of vividáthuḥ (1c) and vāsáyathaḥ (2a) are not
applicable. Perhaps it acquired its accent redactionally because the reasons for the
accents of those two verbs were no longer clear.</p>
<h3 id="vi723">VI.72.3</h3>
<p>I do not understand why the Vṛtra-smashing is couched in the pres. tense,
hatháḥ. The injunc. 2nd du. hatám would fit the same metrical slot, and its
corresponding impf. ahatam was in fact used in 1d. The rest of the vs. is preterital,
with augmented imperfects amanyata (b), airayatam (c) and pf. paprathuḥ (d). One
might argue that the accented injunc. could easily be mistaken for the masc. acc. sg.
ppl. as a modifier of áhim … vṛtrám, but hatám as 2nd du. impv. is fairly common
elsewhere (though, it seems, not with an acc. sg. obj. that could facilitate the
misidentification). Another possibility is that this is an attempt to convey relative
tense in the absence of a functional pluperfect: if Heaven’s giving consent (2nd half of
b; ánu … amanyata) logically precedes the smashing itself — not a foregone
conclusion: Heaven may have cheered them on while they performed the smashing
— then the present hatháḥ would express the action that followed the one conveyed
by the impf. amanyata. But I consider this unlikely.
Well-attested samudrá- is otherwise masc.; with Lü (192 and n. 1) I take neut.
pl. samudrā́ṇi in d as an adj. and supply árṇāṃsi from c.</p>
<h3 id="vi724">VI.72.4</h3>
<p>Ge (see also Gr) takes āmā́su as modifying vakṣáṇāsu (“in die rohen
Bäuche”), which is certainly possible grammatically. However, in other instantiation
of this paradox it is the cows that are raw. (See an ex. below.) Hence the publ. tr.,
with first the cows (a), then the udders of the cows (b) as the depoisitory of the
cooked milk.
Ge follows Gr in taking the fem. of jágat- (here loc. pl. jágatīṣu) as simply
designating a female creature (“in … weiblichen Tieren”), but esp. in this context, in
which the milk is held firm despite not being tied, the fact that the cows are in motion
seems relevant. Cf. another phrasing of the same image in III.30.14 āmā́pakváṃ
carati bíbhratī gaúḥ “Herself raw, the cow roams about carrying the cooked (milk),”
where carati seems to correspond semantically to jágatīṣu here.
The publ. tr. might be slightly altered to reflect the unaccented āsu in c: “within
them, the dappled moving (cows).”</p>
<h3 id="vi725">VI.72.5</h3>
<p>Ge, flg. Sāy, supplies rayím in ab, quite persuasively because the same
phrase apatyasā́cam śrútyam explicitly modifying rayím is found in I.117.23,
II.30.11. Re suggests rather śúṣmam on the basis of c, but this does not enter into the
same formulaic nexus and seems a less likely gift in any case.</p>

<h3 id="vi731">VI.73.1</h3>
<p>Pāda c is somewhat troubled, since neither of the first two words,
dvibárhajmā prāgharmasád, is clear. Let us work from the end. The rt. noun cmpd.
prāgharma-sád- is not otherwise attested, but gharma-sád- ‘sitting by the gharma
drink/pot’ is found in adjacent vss. in X.15.9–10, also characterizing pitár-. It is not
clear what the prefixed prā- would add semantically (see Old, Ge n. 1c, Scar 564)
nor why it should have a long vowel (if it belongs to prá). I therefore favor a
different segmentation of the sequence, one roundly rejected by Old even as he
mentioned it &ndash; namely, to take the prā as the final of the preceding word, hence (in
the first instance, but see below) *dvibárhajmā-prā(ḥ), as the root noun to √prā ‘fill’.
This requires a change in the Saṃhitā text: accenting the prā́(ḥ) and (possibly, but
see below) de-accenting dvibárha-, hence *dvibarhajmā-prā́(ḥ). This root noun is
common in such cmpds; see, e.g., antarikṣa-prā́- ‘filling the midspace’, rodasī-prā́-
‘filling the two world-halves’, with similar cosmic locales. Rather than seeing in
dvibárhajmā- a form of ájman- ‘course, drive’ with Ge, Re, Scar 255 (e.g., Ge ‘der
eine doppelte Bahn(?) hat’) (Schmidt B+I 214 refuses to tr.), I segment it rather as -
jmā-, with the -jm- ‘earth’ element belonging to the archaic and multiformed kṣám-
‘earth’ word (see also Re, who, though drawn to the possibility in his comm., rejects
it in tr.). The supposed prior member dvibárha- obviously strongly resembles the
reasonably (14x) well-attested s-stem bahuvrīhi dvibárhas-. But we should expect
*dvibarho-jmā- or the like and must therefore posit either a thematic byform *-
barha- or a secondary redactional adjustment. (Wackernagel’s solution, flg.
Bartholomae [AiG I.339, cf. II.1.65, 125], that dvibárha-jmā- was simplified from
*dvibárhaj-jmā, with -aj- the sandhi form of -ad-, which in turn is a sandhi form of -
as- before a voiced sound, seems to me without merit, though clever.)
In any case, the unclarity of the structure of the cmpd. and the uncertainty of the
lexical affiliation of -jmā- or -ajmā in the posited *dvibarhajmā-prā́- could have led
to redactional reanalysis, with segmentation of *prā́, which was then attached to what
follows. However, one problem with my analysis is that it assumes a three-member
cmpd. *dvibarha-jmā-prā́-; these are rare in the RV and might be expected to be
rarer when archaic elements are involved. I therefore have a further suggestion,
which also addresses another problem with the analysis. Consider VI.19.1, where
Indra is described as carṣaṇīprā́utá dvibárhā(ḥ) “filling the domains and doubly
lofty.” If we re-segment and readjust the beginning of our sequence here, to a twoword phrase *dvibárhā *jmā-prā́(ḥ), *dvibárhā can keep its accent, we are saved
from positing the thematic byform (since *dvibárhā would be nom. sg. m. to the sstem), and we avoid a three-member compd. True, we have to lengthen the final of
dvibárha, but it is already metrically heavy (before the cluster -jm-). This would
yield a description of Bṛhaspati “doubly lofty, filling the earth” that is similar to that
of Indra in VI.19.1. It also fits the thematics of the hymn; note Bṛhaspati’s bellowing
to the two world-halves in d and, especially, his making wide space (ulokám …
cakā́ra) in the next vs.</p>
<h3 id="vi733">VI.73.3</h3>
<p>I do not understand why hánti in d is accented. Nor does Old (“Akzent …
befremdet”). Both Ge and Re evade the problem by reading pāda-init. bṛ́haspátiḥ
121
with the previous pāda as subj. of a nominal sentence, leaving hánti to begin a new
cl. The publ. tr. does the same. Despite adopting the Ge/Re strategem in my tr., I
consider this solution artificial but have nothing better to offer.
VI.74 Soma and Rudra
Re EVP IX.74 and 128.</p>
<h3 id="vi741">VI.74.1</h3>
<p>In my view, iṣṭí- in b is meant to express both ‘desire’ and ‘sacrifice’ (from
√iṣ and √yaj respectively), encapsulating the reciprocity inherent in the compact
between gods and men. Ge is sympathetic to ‘sacrifice’ (n. 1b) but points to the
accent: ‘sacrifice’ is ordinarily accented íṣṭi-. But secondary senses (that is, puns)
often ignore accentual differences, and furthermore, as JL has persuasively argued,
the older accent of -tí-abstracts was suffixal, and selective accent retraction can be
observed in the course of the Vedic period, so we might assume an older *iṣṭí-
‘sacrifice’.</p>
<h3 id="vi743">VI.74.3</h3>
<p>The nominal rel. cl. yád … ásti is in some sense pleonastic: the two ppl.
baddhám and kṛtám could simply modify the neut. énaḥ directly. But the structure
seems designed to sketch a two-level structure: the outrage commited (by us) that is
bound to us. Note that abl. asmát should be construed with the main cl. (“unhitch,
release … from us”: áva syatam muñcátam … asmát), and so the rel. cl. is
technically speaking embedded. But this seems to be one of the fairly common
examples of semi-embedded izafe-type relative clauses.</p>
<h3 id="vi744">VI.74.4</h3>
<p>As often, a pattern imposed earlier in the hymn is partly altered at the end.
In this case the vs.-initial voc. sómārudrau of 1–3 is postponed till the beginning of
the 2nd pāda.
The simplicity and banality of this hymn (and perhaps an eye to the finish line)
seem to have led both Ge and Re into uncharacteristic (and independent) lapses: Ge
tr. ab in the 3rd ps., despite the clear voc. sómārudrau and clear 2nd du. impv.
mṛḷatam; Re twists (at considerable verbal expense and with a characteristic
parenthesis) the du. sumanasyámānā ending the vs. as an acc. pl. modifying naḥ:
“protégez nous (en sorte que nous ayons) l’esprit bien disposé.”</p>
<h2 id="vi75-weapons">VI.75 Weapons</h2>
<p>Re EVP XVI (1976): 109–11 provides notes; it is tr. in the earlier Hymnes
spéculatifs (1956) but without philological notes.
It is possible that this hymn was tacked onto the maṇḍala because of
tigmā́yudhau tigmáhetī “possessing sharp weapons and sharp missiles” at the end of
the preceding hymn (VI.74.3), though this is not a necessary hypothesis. The first 14
vss. are repeated in a number of places in the early Vedic ritual texts as part of the
Aśvamedha (e.g., VS XXIX.38–51, TS IV.6.6).</p>
<h3 id="vi751">VI.75.1</h3>
<p>The first word of the hymn, jīmū́tasya, signals that we are out of the core
122
RVic lexical domain: this word for ‘thunder-cloud’ is found only here in the RV,
though it is fairly amply attested elsewhere in early Vedic, and it has no obvious
synchronic or diachronic etymology.
The construction of the riddle seems a bit weak to me, since the solution, given
in d, várman-, is anticipated by its derivative varmín- in b.</p>
<h3 id="vi752">VI.75.2</h3>
<p>This vs. displays the proper RVic distribution of the suppletive stem of
‘bow’, whose nom./acc. sg. is supplied by dhánus- and the rest of its paradigm (and
cmpding forms) by dhánvan-. On this suppletion see AiG III.318 and esp. the
detailed disc. of Hoffmann (Aufs. I.330 = Spr. 20 [1974] 18), as well as EWA s.v.
dhánuṣ-. Here the instr. sg. dhánvanā opens pādas a, b, and d (and see loc. dhánvan
in the next vs. 3c), while nom./acc. sg. dhánuḥ holds the same position in c. Gr
identifies a single occurrence of dhánva as nom./acc. sg. (V.7.7), which would thus
violate the suppletive pattern, but this is otherwise universally and rightly assigned to
the homonymous stem dhánvan- ‘wasteland’. The form dhánva (or quite possibly
dhánvā) in II.33.10 is identified by Gr as a pl., which would fit the suppletive
paradigm. It is generally, however, taken as a sg., which would not. However, see
comm. ad II.33.10, where I now suggest restoring Gr’s pl. interpr., contra the
standard sg. renderings incl. that of the publ. tr. The RV suppletive pattern is soon
broken: already in the AV dhánus- begins to acquire oblique forms.
Technically speaking, dhánuḥ could be an acc., modified by apakāmám (if this
stem can be adjectival; see below), which could be tr. “he makes the bow of his rival
lose its desire,” but this requires supplying a generic animate subject for kṛṇoti. The
stem apakāmá-, again a hapax in the RV but found elsewhere in early Vedic, is
generally taken as a noun (Ge’s ‘Unlust’ being the best rendering), but I think it
possible that it’s a nominalized bahuvrīhi ‘having desire gone/away’; there are not
enough stems of this structure to anchor the grammatical value to accentual behavior,
in my opinion. In any case, lacking the useful German ‘Unlust’, I have tr. as if we
had a lexeme *ápa √kṛ ‘make (go) away’, with kā́ma- as obj. Cf. ápa-ā́√kṛ in
passages like nearby VI.59.8 ápa dvéṣāṃsy ā́kṛtam “make hatreds stay far away” (≅
III.16.5). (Gr identifies one instance of an ápa √kṛ, in VIII.18.7, but the verb and
preverb there belong to separate constituents; see comm. ad loc.)</p>
<h3 id="vi753">VI.75.3</h3>
<p>In d sámane, lit. ‘togethering’ vel sim., has a double sense, referring to the
‘gathering’ of battle as well as to a festive gathering, with the latter appropriate to the
female similes in the vs.
Exactly what sound is expressed by the verb śiṅkte is unclear (beyond possibly
“shink”). Not only is this verb barely attested, but it is hard to conceive of a sound
that both a maiden and a stretched bowstring would make. One of the practical
questions is whether this 2nd hemistich still depicts the bowstring pulled back to the
archer’s ear and held there or if it has moved on to the release of the bowstring as it
propels the arrow; pāda d might suggest the latter. Numerous possibilities have been
tried. The publ. tr.’s ‘jangles’ was meant to evoke the later kāvya trope of a woman
dancer with jingling anklets, but I recognize that it is a less good fit with the
123
bowstring &ndash; though it might work if the string has just been loosed. The only other
occurrence of the verb in early Vedic (not in a repetition of this vs.) is in the riddle
hymn, I.164.29, where it may refer to the sound that the gharma pot makes as the
milk is being heated in it. The publ. tr. (JPB) renders it ‘hums’ there (so also
Doniger), Whitney in the equivalent AVŚ passage (IX.10.7) ‘twang’; the latter is an
unlikely noise for a pot, but so, I think, is humming. (And certainly jangling or
twanging seems out.) In our passage Ge tr. “quieckt” (squeak, squeal) and Re
(Hymnes spéc.) “vibre”; in the TS equivalent (IV.6.6c) Keith “twangeth”; in the VS
equivalent (XXIX.40) Griffith “whispers” (so also Maurer for the RV). Acdg. to the
internet, all bows make some sort of a twanging sound when the string is released,
but the better tuned a bow is, the quieter: well-tuned bows can be almost silent. Since
twanging seems excluded for a maiden and since none of the other suggestions is
particularly compelling, I will stick with ‘jangle’, though not with much confidence.
The standard tr. take pāráyantī in a fairly generic sense (e.g., Ge’s “die …
durchhilft”), but its literal meaning ‘cause to cross / reach the far shore’ works just as
well, if not better, if we supply ‘arrow’ as obj.: the bowstring celebrated here causes
the arrows to cross the space from the bow to the battle.</p>
<h3 id="vi754">VI.75.4</h3>
<p>The pun on sámana- implicit in 3d is made explicit in 4a; the single word is
held constant, but in two different senses, between the simile and the frame.
Maurer (308) considers the simile in b “a bit irregular, since, strictly speaking,
it is not the bow-ends that hold the arrow, but the bowstring.” But if the bow is held
on a horizontal axis, with the bow ends horizontally aligned, the part of the bow
between the ends dips down like a lap, and it is the lowest part where the tip of the
arrow is placed. Again according to the internet, the bow should be parallel to the
ground when positioning the arrow on it (an action called “nocking”); this would be
the position envisioned above.
The 2nd hemistich depicts the positions of the ends of the bow while the arrow is
shot: first (c) the two ends of the bow approach each other as the bowstring is pulled
back, decreasing the vertical space between the ends &ndash; although as far as I can tell
from YouTube, the ends never actually meet. This movement is described as
saṃvidāné ‘finding each other’. The lexeme sám √vid often has the more abstract
sense ‘make an agreement’, and I think this may also be operative in the passage,
though I’m not quite sure how: perhaps their agreement or compact is to “pierce the
rivals” (ápa śátrūn vidhyatām), as the rest of the pāda urges. Most tr. only recognize
this latter sense in our passage (e.g., Re, Hymnes spéc., “d’un commun accord”),
missing the physical sense applicable to the manipulation of the bow. In d the
bowstring is released, propelling the arrow, and the two ends “spring apart”
(viṣphurántī) and resume their position at rest. The contrastive preverb pair sám / ví
calls attention to these contrastive actions. None of the tr. I consulted (Ge, Re,
Doniger, Maurer, as well as Keith for TS and Griffith for VS) seems to have
recognized that a two-step process is being described. There is one possible problem
with my interpr., namely that forms of the root √sphṝ often take an object, and there
is an acc. amítrān here that it could govern. However, there are a number of forms to
124
the root that lack objects, incl. the other occurrences of the participle (VII.89.2) and
nearby aor. ápa spharīḥ (VI.61.14). And I prefer to take amítrān either as a further
specification of the obj. of ápa … vidhyatām in c or as a poorly marked acc. of goal.</p>
<h3 id="vi755">VI.75.5</h3>
<p>The expression bahúr asya putráḥ in the singular is somewhat surprising
next to the fem. pl. bahvīnā́m, but Re’s suggestion that it is a “bahuvrīhi défait” can
be adopted, whatever we may think the grammatical process is. I have adopted
Griffith’s “with many a son” (both RV and VS tr.; see also Maurer), which is
surprisingly apt. As is generally recognized, the masc. and fem. referents are both
arrows: in addition to the standard fem. íṣu-, forming part of the ‘quiver’ cmpd itself
(iṣudhí- in c), there are masc. ‘arrow’ words, incl. bāṇá-, found in vs. 17 below, and
śalyá-.
Another onomatopoetic word: ciścā́, which is a hapax (though cf. ciściṣākāram,
with √kṛ as here, not attested till the sūtras; see Hoffmann Aufs. 39). Since it
expresses the sound of the quiver, “clatter” (pub. tr.), “rattle” (Doniger, Maurer),
“clang and clash” (Griffith, RV and VS) all seem within reasonable range; Keith’s
“whiz” much less so. Again the sound may in fact just be “chishcha.”</p>
<h3 id="vi756">VI.75.6</h3>
<p>Both hemistichs of this vs. express the same paradox, that an entity behind
can lead something in front of it. In ab the good charioteer (suṣārathíḥ) “leads
forward” (nayati … puráḥ) the horses that are physically in front of him; in cd the
reins, which stretch in front of the charioteer from his hands, follow his mind, which
is physically behind them (mánaḥ paścā́d ánu).</p>
<h3 id="vi757">VI.75.7</h3>
<p>The middle of kṛṇvate is nicely appropriate.
The publ. tr. follows Re in taking vājáyantaḥ as belonging to the denom. stem
‘seek the prize’, despite the accent (expect *vājayántaḥ), since we would otherwise
expect the part. to have an object. See also Old, ZDMG 55.294 (=KlSch 753).
In its other RVic occurrence (X.163.4) prápada- means ‘front of the foot’, but
here I find it hard to assume that the horses are daintily trampling the soldiers with
their tippy-toes and so tr. “with their forefeet.” However, since technically it seems
that horses do walk/run on their toes, perhaps that’s what the poet intended.
Moreover, IH points out that it would be the front of the horses’ hooves that would
first make impact on the soldiers’ fallen bodies.
The sense of ánapavyayantaḥ is disputed, or rather most tr. water down what I
think its sense must be. It’s a negated part. to ápa √vyā ‘strip off, divest’ of
garments, to √vyā ‘envelop, wrap’. See VII.81.1 ápo máhi vyayati … támaḥ “She
[Dawn] unwraps the great darkness.” But most tr. attenuate this in some way that
loses the sense of the root entirely, e.g., Ge “ohne sich zu entziehen” (withdraw
oneself), Griffith “never flinching,” Keith “unflinchingly,” Doniger “without veering
away,” Maurer “unrelenting”; Re (EVP) assigns it to a different root: ápa-veti
‘cesser’ (whose participle should be *-vyant-; he doesn’t deal with the morphology),
though in Hymnes spéc. he tr. “sans même s&rsquo;écarter (de leur voie).” I think we should
take the form seriously and I suggest that it means that the horses’ trampling is so
125
powerful that it can kill a man even while he is still in armor (hence my “without
divesting”). That the form is underlyingly transitive (as I have just claimed) is
disputed on principle by Lowe (Participles in Rigvedic Sanskrit, 277), where he
argues that negated participles are (“almost always”) intransitive and tr. this ex. as
“without withdrawing.” I would dispute the principle and therefore his interpr. of this
passage.</p>
<h3 id="vi758">VI.75.8</h3>
<p>I follow Ge in accepting the view of the comm. to VS XXIX.45 that háviḥ is
a shortening of havirdhāna- ‘oblation-deposit’, with the √dhā supplied by the
definition found in the next pāda, containing níhitam ‘deposited’. However, see Old
in particular for other ways to interpr. háviḥ.
The standard tr. take úpa … sadema as transitive with the chariot as object: e.g.,
Ge “setzen,” Re (Hymnes spéc.) “installer,” Doniger “place,” Oberlies (II.223)
“setzen.” But úpa √sad is a standard locution for ‘reverently approach, do honor to’,
and that surely is the sense here (so Griffith, Maurer “hono(u)r”).</p>
<h3 id="vi759">VI.75.9</h3>
<p>On kṛchre-śrít- see most recently Scar (543–44). Re’s (EVP) objection to
Ge’s tr. (“die Zuflucht in der Note”) and his over-complex substitute can, I think,
reasonably be dismissed.
Most tr. take citrá-senāḥ as containing the ‘army’ word (e.g., Ge “eine
wunderbare Heerschar bildend”), and this is certainly possible. I interpr. it rather as
‘weapon’ because of the proximity of íṣu- ‘arrow’ in the adjoining cmpd íṣubalāḥ
‘arrow-strong’.</p>
<h3 id="vi7510">VI.75.10</h3>
<p>This is the last vs. of the first part of the hymn (see publ. intro.), at least by
content, though the next vs. is also in trimeter meter, and it has a typically eclectic
group of addressees and divine name-checks.
Pāda b could be simply a nominal sentence: “H+E (are) kindly to us,” but the
hortatory cast of the 2nd hemistich makes this unlikely.
Pūṣan probably makes his appearance here because he watches over roads and
journeys.
The 2nd singular impv. rákṣā beginning d has no obvious subject. The voc.
immediately preceding it, at the end of c, is pl. ṛṭāvṛdhaḥ, as are the other vocc. in
pāda a. The only available sg. is pūṣā́in c, but he is subj. of a 3rd ps. impv. The pāda
is identical to nearby VI.71.3d, where the sg. Savitar is the addressee, and it was
presumably adapted from there, as Re (EVP) notes. As the last pāda of the apparent
hymn-ending vs., it is not surprising that it has an external source and is only loosely
attached.</p>
<h3 id="vi7511">VI.75.11</h3>
<p>The “eagle” is of course the feathers that provide the fletching at the back
end of the arrow. The “tooth” of the arrow is presumably its tip &ndash; the arrowhead &ndash;
so called because it “bites” its target. The arrowhead is quite unlikely to have been
made from a deer’s tooth, however &ndash; their teeth being short and flat and unsuitable
for piercing. But acdg to the internet, deer antlers were/are used for primitive
126
arrowheads. The cows in pāda b are of course leather sinews, and again the internet
tells us that sinew was/is frequently used to attach the arrowhead to the shaft (with
some how-to advice, which generally involves chewing on the leather first).
Pāda b recalls 5d, though the material objects in questions are different, the
quiver in 5, the arrow in 11: pāda-final prásūtā matches prásūtaḥ in 5d in the same
metrical position, and both contain the past part. of √nah ‘tie’ earlier in the pāda,
also in the same metrical position, 5d x x nínaddhaḥ, 11b x x sáṃnaddhā
The verb of pāda d is literally “run together and apart” (sáṃ ca ví ca drávanti),
but “clash and separate” seemed to me to have a better ring.</p>
<h3 id="vi7512">VI.75.12</h3>
<p>śárma yachatu at the end of d responds to śárma yaṃsan ending the
previous vs., though the vss. are in different meters.</p>
<h3 id="vi7513">VI.75.13</h3>
<p>The first hemistich is strongly alliterative: jaṅghanti … jaghánān …
jighnate and plays on two different redupl. verb forms to √han: the intensive and the
regular redupl. pres. Although I generally agree with Schaefer that “intensives” are
really frequentatives most of the time, in this particular passage the presence of the
med. redupl. pres. jighnate, which almost always has pl. objects (as here) and
therefore fills the frequentative slot, pushes the intens. stem jaṅghan- towards a true
intensive value.
prácetas- ‘discerning’ may seem an odd descriptor for horses, but the point is
well captured by Doniger’s “who sense what is ahead” (perhaps an expansion on
Re’s [Hymnes spéc.] ‘prévoyant’). The horses are presumably too smart to go into
battle unless they’re forced by the whip.</p>
<h3 id="vi7514">VI.75.14</h3>
<p>This is the last of the vss. repeated in the Aśvamedha sections of the YV.
pári is the signature word of this vs.: páry eti (a), paribā́dhamānaḥ (b), pári
pātu (d).
On the cmpd hasta-ghná- see Old and Lü (ZDMG 96: 39), the latter
summarized by Re (EVP).
There are numerous diff. interpr. of vayúnāni here. I assume that it refers to the
different possible trajectories of the bowstring when it is released.
The last pāda may emphasize the masculinity of the handguard and the archer
because the bowstring, from which the handguard protects the archer, is feminine.</p>
<h3 id="vi7515">VI.75.15</h3>
<p>The antelope head and metal mouth of the arrow are not entirely clear. I
assume that this refers to a deer-antler arrowhead (as in 11a) with a further metal tip
attached to it. The internet assures me that such things have been discovered, if
rarely, in archaeological contexts. Ge (n. 15b) suggests either this or that the múkham
is the ring that connects the shaft and the arrowhead. But as far as I can tell, in my
exploration of the odd internet world of makers of primitive arrowheads, there would
not be a separate metal ring or socket used to attach a bone/antler arrowhead to the
shaft; when there’s a metal attachment, the whole arrowhead is metal.
In a hymn so attuned to the grammatical gender, and therefore of the
127
metaphorical gender, of the key words, there is a special frisson in describing the
feminine arrow (íṣu-) &ndash; here in the dat. íṣvai, whose -v-ai stem+ending shows the
specifically feminine inflection of short -u-stems &ndash; with a cmpd that ends with -
retas- ‘semen’. The accent of the cmpd parjánya-retas- shows that it must be a
bahuvrīhi ‘having (or in this case, in my opinion, receiving) the semen of
Thunder/Parjanya’; hence tr. like Re (Hymnes spéc) “semence de Parjanya,” Doniger
“to this seed of Parjanya” are misleading and grammatically wrong. As to what this
refers to in practical terms, Re may well be correct that the shaft of the arrow is made
of reed, which grows in the rains and is associated with the thunderstorm.</p>
<h3 id="vi7516">VI.75.16</h3>
<p>amī́ṣām is of course the gen. pl. of the far deictic prn. asaú and could be
more literally tr. as “do not leave a single one of those yonder standing,” but this
seemed a bit heavy.</p>
<h3 id="vi7517">VI.75.17</h3>
<p>The beloved RVic contrast of sám and ví is on display here with
saṃpátanti (a) and viśikhā́ḥ (b).
Strictly speaking, iva comes too late in the simile kumārā́viśikhā́iva, since the
‘lads’ must definitely belong to the simile, not the frame. This late placement is not
unusual, however. Because of the multivalence of ví the bahuvrīhi viśikhá- can have
two different senses and has been interpr. with both. If in this cmpd means ‘without’,
as often, the whole cmpd means ‘without/lacking hair’ &ndash; so Gr “ohne Kopfhaare”; he
is followed by Re (Hymnes spéc.) “aux crêtes dénouées” and Maurer “tuftless.” By
contrast, if ví means ‘out, apart’, as often, the cmpd means ‘with hair apart’, that is,
perhaps, sticking out every which way. Ge renders it “mit aufgelöstem Haarbusch,”
and he is followed by Doniger “with untrimmed locks of hair” and me; Old
implicitly assumes the same meaning. If the first meaning is correct, these could in
fact be some kind of projectile that lacks fletching. (Acdg. to the internet, it is
possible to shoot unfletched arrows, though not generally recommended.) Or perhaps
the arrows lost their fletching in the intensity of the shooting. Nonetheless, this seems
the less likely sense. If it means “with hair out/apart” (my “unruly hair”), it can refer
either to the arrows themselves, coming in from every angle: if each arrow is
compared to a strand of hair, the visual effect would be of “bedhead” hair, matted
and sticking out in all directions. Or it can refer to the fletching; when innumerable
arrows rain down, their feathers would again produce a chaotic visual effect.
The predicate śárma √yam returns from vss. 11–12, and 17d is identical to 12d.</p>
<h3 id="vi7518">VI.75.18</h3>
<p>Note the near-rhyming forms mármāṇi .. vármaṇā, echoed in c by várīyo
váruṇaḥ.</p>
<h3 id="vi7519">VI.75.19</h3>
<p>I take the phrase svó áraṇo yáś ca níṣṭyaḥ as a three-member sequence
indicating progressive distance from the speaker. I&rsquo;m assuming that in this context an
áraṇa- is someone who inhabits the same general territory, but belongs to a different
group, while the níṣṭya- are from beyond the territory. Re’s tr. (Hymnes spéc.) is in
agreement: “Celui, proche ou lointain ou même étranger.” Others seem to take the 2nd
128
two terms as (near-)synonyms; so explicitly Klein (DGRV I.108–9).</p>
