As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. functions as an extra-hymnic summary vs., signalled by the initial evā́, which often begins summary vss. It is distinguished from the rest of the hymn by being in Triṣṭubh not Jagatī. Its 2nd hemistich also reaches beyond Soma: in c we call on Heaven and Earth, and d is addressed in the 2nd pl. to the gods in general, not to Soma. This pāda has the feel of a refrain, though it is found only once elsewhere, at X.45.12. However, its major elements are found in various permutations in other passages, e.g., I.85.12 rayíṃ no dhatta vṛṣaṇaḥ suvī́ram. For a similar finale see the next hymn, IX.69.10. On the reason for the focus on Heaven and Earth see comm. on that vs. and on IX.70 passim.
