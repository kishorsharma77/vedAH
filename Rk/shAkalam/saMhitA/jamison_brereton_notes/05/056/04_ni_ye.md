ní √ri means ‘make flow’, hence ‘liquefy, dissolve’. In I.127.4 the very similar sthirā́cid ánnā ní riṇāti ójasā has ‘sturdy foods’ as obj., but since Agni is the subject, the food is presumably wood of some sort. In nearby V.58.6 a middle intrans.

of √ri (though without preverb) takes trees as subj.: riṇaté vánāni “the trees dissolve.” I therefore supply them as obj. here.

What then does the simile in b have to do with this? Even unruly oxen are unlikely to dissolve trees. Because the images don’t easily harmonize, I now think that the simile in b should go with the 2nd hemistich: unruly oxen can cause the ground to shake. This is somewhat difficult to convey in tr. -- I might rearrange it to “like oxen averse to the yoke / they shake …” The phrase gā́vaḥ … durdhúraḥ echoes dudhró gaúḥ of 3d phonologically, even though the adjectives are entirely unrelated.

As often Ge takes cid in c as a simile marker, a function for which there is no good evidence.
