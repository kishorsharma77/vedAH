The root affiliation of vyùta- is disputed. WG (flg. Rau) take it to √vā ‘weave’ and tr. ‘geflochten’; so also Gr. and (ultimately) Re (though he vacillates in his n.). Most other tr. to ví √yu ‘separate’. My ‘cast-off’ comes via ‘separate, i.e., set aside, get rid of’. Re’s “serti (d’étoiles)” (sertir =‘to set’, of jewels) does not seem to have much to do with ‘weave’, but supplying “with stars” (stṛ́bhiḥ) as a play on starī́ḥ is clever enough to make his interpr. appealing, though I do not in the end accept it. A bejeweled Night does not fit well with her being starī́- ‘barren’: the contrast is as usual between dazzlingly beautiful Dawn and dreary dark Night. Cf. the black garment Night spreads at the horizon for the Sun in I.115.4. Night does get her chance at ornaments in the one hymn addressed to her, X.127.
