As Old points out (and as is reflected in Ge’s and Re’s tr.), ná must stand for *ná ná, i.e., the simile marker followed by a negative. The same no-last-spoke image is found in V.58.5 with alternative realizations of both simile marker (iva) and negative (privative a-): arā́ivéd ácaramā(ḥ).

The pāda break between c and d goes counter to the syntactic parallelism: syntax: tád eṣām dānā́ meter: ... tád eṣām, mahnā́tád eṣām dānā́mahnā́tád eṣām This produces a syncopated effect, emphasized by the polarized positions of the parallel instr. dānā́and mahnā́in their nominal clauses.
