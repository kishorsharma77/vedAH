Following Ge I take keśíbhiḥ “hairy-maned (horses)” as an appositional simile with gīrbhíḥ: the hymns serve as the team that brings Indra to us along “heaven’s way.” This latter form, dyugát ‘heaven-going’ vel sim., is extensively discussed by Scar (106-7), who ultimately concludes that it is “unklar,” though he favors taking it as a nom. sg. modifying the soma presser (sutā́vān). This seems odd: the somapresser is the one element in this verse who is likely to stay put. I take it, with Gr and (implicitly) Old, as adverbial, referring to the movement of the hymns, as metaphorical horses, through heaven. In his note Ge endorses Sāy’s interpretation of it is a shortening of dyugádbhiḥ, which (as Wolff’s suggestion) Old dismisses without argument. This explanation by truncation certainly does not seem necessary, since a neuter adverb works well enough.
