The half-verse boundary has to be breeched in tr. to avoid awkwardness.

After the spate of act. transitive forms of √vṛdh in vs. 4 (and 3d), the middle pf. part. vāvṛdhānám provides a contrastive intransitive/passive, agreeing with Indra, the object of the transitive forms.

Contra Ge, I take ásāmi with vāvṛdhānám despite the pāda boundary, on the basis of VI.19.2 yó vāvrdhé ás ̥ āmi in this same Indra cycle.

On the ca in b, see Klein, DGRV I.54-55.
