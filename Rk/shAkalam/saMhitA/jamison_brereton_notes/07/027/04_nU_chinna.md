Note the rhyming pāda-final … (sáh)ūtī (a), … ūtī́(b).

In b Ge takes dānáḥ as gen. sg. of dāmán-, dependent on vā́jam: “… den Lohn der Gabe.” This is possible, though it would be more natural to have vā́jam as object of some form of √dā (esp. given the parallel he cites, VI.45.23 dānám vā́jasya, with vā́jasya dependent on dānám). I therefore prefer to take dānáḥ as the ablative singular of the mán-stem, with verbal rection, or, possibly (but somewhat farfetched) the nom. sg. of an otherwise unattested medial root aorist participle of √dā.

The combination of abhí with √vī ‘pursue’ would occur only here in the RV (and the other saṃhitās); Ge renders it as ‘willkommen’. I suggest that it belongs rather to √vyā ‘envelop’ and continues the theme of confinement found in 1d and 2d.

The idea here is that the cow was once enwrapped or enclosed but freed by Indra to 31 swell for us. It is possible that abhívītā is actually a pun on both those roots, and the tr. should reflect this ambiguity: “… gift-cow swells …, (previously) enclosed, (now to be) pursued by his comrades,” vel sim. The presence of vyántaḥ ‘pursuing’ in 5c supports this possibility.
