R̥bhus  
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
5 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5  
Unlike the preceding hymn, this one passes over the R̥bhus’ marvelous achieve ments very quickly, in the first verse, in favor of appeals to those gods to use their skills for our benefit (esp. vss. 2–3). The signature verb is √takṣ “fashion.” In the  final two verses (4–5) it opens out into a sort of All God hymn, with appeals first  to Indra as master of the R̥bhus and then to other gods with little or no connection  to the R̥bhus.
