Both Ge and Re take maháḥ as a nom. sg. masc. to them. mahá- (so also Gr), referring to Soma. With immed. flg. cid the phrase is taken as “already great” (“schon so grosse,” “si grand (fût-il déjà)”), as an implicit contrast with the verb, (abhy) ávardhata, which indicates that he has grown (further) despite his already large size. This if of course possible. By contrast I take maháḥ as acc. pl. m. to máh-. My reason for this is the preverb abhí: in the few occurrences of abhí √vṛdh, the lexeme takes an acc. complement even in the middle. Cf. II.17.4 víśvā bhúvanābhí … abhy ávardhata “he [=Indra] grew strong over all the worlds.” As to who or what these great ones are, perhaps the gods, since the phrase mahó devā́n is not uncommon. Given that Soma here is being assimilated to Indra - who is the standard subject of both mandāná- (I.80.6, etc. etc.) and vṛṣāyáte (cf., e.g., IX.108.2) - asserting his mastery over the (other) gods wouldn’t be surprising.
