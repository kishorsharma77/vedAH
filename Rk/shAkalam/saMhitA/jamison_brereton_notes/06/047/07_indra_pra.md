The vs. is built on variant repetition: ab prá ṇah …, prá naḥ … prataram / c su-pāró ati-pārayó / d sú-nītiḥ … vāmá-nītiḥ.

I have no idea why in the identical sequence prá + naḥ, the first has retroflexed ṇ and the latter does not. Both prá-s are preverbs in tmesis with 2nd sg.

impvs. (paśya and naya). The only differences are 1) the first prá sequence is not initial (being preceded by voc. índra), 2) in the second sequence the impv.

immediately follows naḥ, while in the first some verbal material intervenes, and 3) in the first naḥ functions as a dat. but in the second as an acc. None of these differences should (as far as I can see) trigger different sandhi effects.
