Indra  
Śāsa Bhāradvāja  
5 verses: anuṣṭubh  
The martial Indra, the “commander,” is called upon here to destroy our various  enemies. A  surprising amount of attention is given to “the scornful” (vss. 2–4).  Although verbal abuse may not seem to modern mentalities to pose the same sort of threat as more physical assaults, the ancient Indian belief in the power of speech  to inflict real harm is on view here. At issue may also be ritualized exchanges of  insults before battle.
