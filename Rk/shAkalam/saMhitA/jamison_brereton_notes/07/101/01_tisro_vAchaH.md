As was noted in the publ. intro., this hymn has a penchant for triplets, but it is not always clear which three entities are referred to -- as in this vs., at least for me, with “the three speeches.” As Ge points out (n. 1a), the identities of the speeches depends on the identity of the addressee of the impv. “speak forth” (prá vada). If it is Parjanya, the dedicand of the hymn, they probably refer to thunder(claps) (so, e.g., Lü, Va 392 -- three because they sound in the three heavenly domains) or thunder, lightning, and rain (so, e.g., Doniger 174). I am inclined to follow Lü but for reasons 132 differing from his. I suggest that this could be an early version of the triple utterance “da da da” of Thunder in BĀU V.2, made famous in the West by T. S. Eliot in the section of The Wasteland entitled “What the Thunder Said.” Note that in BĀU V.2.3 Thunder or the thundering one (stanayitnuḥ) is identified as daivī vāk (like the three vā́c- here).

If the impv. is the self-address of the poet, it would refer probably to the three types of ritual speech (ṛ́c-, sā́man-, yájus-), or, on the basis of VII.33.14 (which contains prá vadāty ágre, similar to our prá vada [jyótir]agrā), solemn speech (ukthá-), melody (sā́man-), and the sound of the pressing stone -- or, less likely in my view, with Ge three dynamic levels of sound, soft, medium, loud. Needless to say, both sets of referents may be meant. In the natural world interpr., the “light at the front” would of course be lightning; in the ritual interpr. it would be the ritual fire.

The three speeches milk the udder of pāda b. Again the identities of the referents of the udder and the liquid it produces depend on the referents in pāda a. In the natural world interpr., the udder would be heaven or the clouds therein, the liquid the rain; in the ritual the udder would probably be the soma plant and the liquid the soma -- though the udder could possibly be the sacrifice as a whole and the good things that result from its performance.

In the publ. tr. of the 2nd hemistich it was not made clear which nouns go together -- since Engl. lacks the convenient tool of case. The calf (vatsám) is the same as the embryo of the plants (gárbham óṣadhīnām); both are objects of the participle ‘creating’ (kṛṇván), whose subject is the bull (vṛṣabháḥ), which is also the referent in the phrase “as soon as he is born” (sadyó jātáḥ) and the subj. of “sets to bellowing” (roravīti). The calf, embryo of the plants, is most likely Agni, who is so called elsewhere (see Ge n. 1c). Ge suggests that it is Agni as lightning, which is possible, but I assume that lightning and the ritual fire are here assimilated, via a trope whereby the sound of thunder, likened to ritual speech, kindles the ritual fire.

The bull is surely Parjanya, as is confirmed by the identical phraseology of vs. 2 of the next, related hymn (VII.102.2): yó gárbham óṣadhīnām … kṛṇóti … / parjányaḥ.
