Old suggests that we read ánuṃ, not ánu, in b -- thus a PN, not a preverb -

- given the co-occurrence of the PNs ánu- and druhyú- elsewhere, incl. 14a, I.108.8,
etc., as well as the vṛddhi deriv. ā́nava- in the next vs. (13c). I have adopted this suggestion; note that it does not affect the meter, as the next word (druhyúm) begins with a cluster.

The relationship between the two hemistichs is loose and unclear. On the basis of vs. 11, esp. 11d, and the epithet vájrabāhuḥ in 12b, we are entitled to assume that the 1st hemistich has Indra as subject and is couched in the 3rd ps. But the 2nd hemistich refers twice to ‘you’ (d tvāyántaḥ … tvā), manifestly referring also to Indra, and the verb in the first hemistich, ní vṛṇak is ambig. between 2nd and 3rd -- a typical modulation point. I would keep the publ. tr. (“he wrenched down”), but with the awareness that the transition to 2nd ps. reference may already be underway.

The 2nd hemistich has Indra’s followers as subj., with d containing a rel. cl.

with nom. pl. yé. How to construe it is the question. Although there is no overt (or indeed covert) representation of this plural group in the first hemistich, Ge takes the whole of cd as an improper relative, tr. “während deine Anhänger, Freundschaft für Freundschaft erwählend, dir zujubelten.” This not only reinterprets yé as a general subordinator rather than a rel. prn., but it also has this subordinator placed very 9 deeply in its supposed clause. I prefer to take pāda c as containing a predicated root aor. part. vṛṇānā́ḥ [“(They were) choosing your partnership … (those) who …”], which allows the rel. cl. of d to have a more standard configuration, referring to the pl. subj. of the nominal clause of c.
