Heaven and Earth (1), Dadhikrā (2–10)  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
10 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn and the next two (IV.39–40) are dedicated to a horse known as  Dadhikrā(van), a prizewinning racer and a warhorse. Although no doubt in part  referring to a real horse belonging to Trasadasyu, king of the Pūrus, it also repre sents the sacrificial horse of the great royal sacrifice, the Aśvamedha, and a symbol  of Pūru, and then general Ārya, hegemony. In this capacity it is compared to the  sun, in the last, triumphal verse.  
What the reader will notice most, however, is the exuberance and precision of  the equine imagery, emphasizing especially the headlong speed of the horse and his  constant goal: groups of female animals, presumably mares. The sense of speed is  enhanced by the regular use of “and” to string verses together; indeed, the hymn  begins with one. Unfortunately some of the imagery is not entirely clear; see espe  
cially verse 4, where some of the translation is provisional.  

Although the Anukramaṇī assigns the first verse to Heaven and Earth, it is more  likely that Mitra and Varuṇa are the referents of the unspecified duals.
