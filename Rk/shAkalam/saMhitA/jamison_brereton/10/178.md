Tārksyạ
Ariṣṭanemi Tārkṣya
3 verses: triṣṭubh
A being named Tārkṣya is found in a few other places in Vedic literature, with  varying identities. Here it seems to be the name of a prodigious and mythical  racehorse, much like Dadhikrā(van) (see IV.38–40); indeed verse 3 here is a vari ant of the Dadhikrā verse IV.38.10. Both horses are associated with Trasadasyu,  leader of the Pūrus: his association with Dadhikrā is announced directly in the first  Dadhikrā verse (IV.38.1), whereas his association with Tārkṣya is mediated through  the horse’s name, which is a vr̥ddhi derivative of Tr̥kṣi, himself a descendant of  Trasadasyu (see VIII.22.7, see also VI.46.8).

This god-sped prizewinner, victorious overtaker of (other) chariots, him whose wheel-felly cannot be damaged, the swift one driving to
battle—Tārkṣya would we summon here for our well-being.
## 2
Summoning his generosity again and again, like that of Indra, we would  board him like a boat for our well-being.
O you two who are broad like the two wide (worlds), voluminous and  deep—let us not suffer harm of you in our coming nor in our going.

Who just in a single day stretches across the five peoples with his vast  power, like the sun across the waters with his light,
his is the charge that wins thousands, that wins hundreds. They do not  block him, anymore than a youthful arrow.
