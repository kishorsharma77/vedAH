In c I read the injunctive ánu caraḥ twice, once as preterite and once with future meaning, contrary to Ge, who only takes it as a modal: “Du mögest … nachgehen” (followed by Klein II.121). The peculiar position of the ádha and the presence of dvitā́suggest this double interpretation to me, though admittedly pādafinal ádha dvitā́does occur elsewhere without this syntactic effect (e.g., I.132.3, VI.16.4).
