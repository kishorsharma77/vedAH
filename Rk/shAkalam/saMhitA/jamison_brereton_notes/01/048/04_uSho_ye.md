This verse is somewhat oddly constructed, especially the distribution of elements in cd. The opening of c, átrā́ha tád, seems overburdened with functionless elements, esp. the tád, which has no obvious referent. As it turns out, this opening is found elsewhere (I.135.8, 154.6), with a likewise referent-less tád. I therefore assume that the tád here emphasizes the temporal/logical átra. Then we find two gen. plurals, eṣām and nṝṇā́m, separated from each other, but probably ultimately coreferential. I assume that enclitic eṣām serves as the correlative for yé in pāda a (though we might expect téṣām) and that the unusually heavy opening of the pāda has bumped it into pseudo-second position after the first real word of the clause, káṇvaḥ. But until we understand more about the interaction of the placement of these various elements, this is simply an after-the-fact description. It should be noted that eṣām generally does not show the standard Wackernagel’s Position behavior (modified 2nd position) that we might expect from an enclitic, and in particular has a tendency to take final position. The nṝṇā́m at the end of the verse simply doubles and further specifies eṣām.

I have tr. nā́ma twice, for ease of English.
