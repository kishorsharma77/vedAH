Ge (n. 3c) takes upavídā … vindate as simply equivalent to upavindate, which is esp. puzzling because úpa is not otherwise construed with √vid in the RV.

My ‘close’ in the tr. ‘close searching’ is meant to convey the intimate nuance of this preverb.

Note the v alliteration in c: upavídā váhnir vindate vásu.
