The intrusion of the 1st sg. speaker through áhve “I have summoned” is remarkable. Who is he? Although ordinarily in the RV the default referent of a 1st ps., esp. a 1st sg., is the poet, I wonder in this instance if it is not the leader of the united forces, the Kriegskönig, calling the clans and their leaders and best warriors to unite them for action.

My tr. differs syntactically in several ways from most tr., though it agrees with Re in both. First, I do not construe instr. nṛ́bhiḥ with sánīḷāḥ (“of the same nest with the men”) but as an independent instr. of accompaniment. This would be the only ex. of sánīḷa- with an instr. By specifying “the clans along with their men,” the poet both refers to the whole social group and singles out its most conspicuous and important members, perhaps the viśpáti-s.

Second, I take devatvā́as an instr. sg., not acc. pl. neut. with víśvāni. There are several reasons for this. The first verse of the next hymn (I.70.1) contains the same phrase víśvāny aśyāḥ, without further specification, and if at all possible the two phrases should be rendered in the same way. Moreover, as Re points out, no direct cases of the plural are attested in this type of derivative. It’s also the case that Agni is characterized by instrumentals in -tvā in this group of hymns (mahitvā́I.67.9, 68.2; krátvā I.69.2), and his divinity is emphasized (I.68.2, 4, 69.2). I am, however, given pause by several passages containing devatvám (sg.) √(n)aś: I.151.9 ná devatvám paṇáyo nā́naśuḥ … and III.60.2 téna devatvám ṛbhavaḥ sám ānaśa.
