Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
8 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn shares some phraseology and themes with the immediately preceding  IV.7, especially Agni’s role as messenger, but it is far less complex than that hymn.  It is also unlike that hymn in its prayers for rich goods from Agni in exchange for  ritual service.
