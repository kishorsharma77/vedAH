The cmpd. viśva-víd- is ambiguous here. Ge and Re both tr. as ‘allknowing’, and that is favored by the context, since it is immediately followed by the voc. kave (‘sage poet’). But the cmpd recurs in the very similar pāda, 39c tváṃ suvī́ro asi soma viśvavít, and that vs. contains three similarly formed cmpds that surely belong to √vid ‘find’: IX.86.39a govít … vasuvíd dhiraṇyavít. There the context favors ‘all-finding’. (Scar treats the two roots √vid together [489], so he is not forced to distinguish.) I suggest, as usual, that it’s a pun.
