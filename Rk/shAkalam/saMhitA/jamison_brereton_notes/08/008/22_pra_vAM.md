It may not be clear in the publ. tr. that “found in many places” is a voc. addressed to the Aśvins and does not qualify the songs and hymns. I take this form as a “vocativized adverb” in Re’s phrase, derived from purutrā́‘in many places’, against the standard opinion that it contains the root noun to √trā ‘protect’ and means ‘protecting many’ (so Sāy, Gr, Ge). Scar (194) considers both options and cannot decide. In fact I do not feel strongly about the analysis reflected in the publ. tr.

and could also accept ‘protecting many’. However, it might be worth noting that the adv. purutrā́frequently occupies pāda-initial position, as here, and that there are several occurrences of it in nearby hymns (VIII.1.7, 5.16, 11.8), one of which (VIII.5.16) is in an Aśvin hymn. The Aśvins are the subj. of a form of √trā only once (VII.71.2), but this is not a strong argument either way.
