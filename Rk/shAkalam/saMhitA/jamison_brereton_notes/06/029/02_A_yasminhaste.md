cyāvayante is the only med. form to this stem, against 16 act. transitive ones.

Although in my 1983 monograph (p. 126 n. 43) I identify it as intransitive, I now think it is a passive to the transitive act.: “are bought to shaking, caused to shake” rather than a simple intr. semantically identical to cyávate (i.e., just ‘shake’). Fear of Indra is the cause and Indra the unexpressed agent.
