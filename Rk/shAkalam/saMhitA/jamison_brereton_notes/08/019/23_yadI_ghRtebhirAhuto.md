Ge takes pāda a as the dependent clause and b as the main clause, but this causes a difficulty: why is bhárate accented? I follow Re in taking ab as the dependent clause and c as the main clause. This accounts for the verbal accent. It also solves another problem: yádī is hard to render as ‘if’, but if analyzed as yád ī (for this phenomenon see Jamison 2002 [Fs. Cardona]), the ī can, as often, double the object, in this case vā́śīm. But if vā́śīm is not part of the dependent clause, ī has no obvious function.

The question then arises, what is pāda c doing? It consists of a nom. (ásuraḥ), a simile marker (iva), and an acc. (nirṇíjam). What binds them together? With Re, I supply *bharate as the verb, from bhárate in b. The verb is used in two different senses: in b it describes the up-and-down motion of Agni raising and lowering (“bearing”) his axe, i.e., his flames, when ghee is poured on the fire, but in c ‘bears’ means ‘wears’, of a garment. This is a standard idiom; cf. I.25.13 bíbhrad drāpiṃ hiraṇyáyaṃ váruṇo vasta nirṇíjam “Bearing [=wearing] a golden mantle, Varuṇa dons his cloak.” This is yet another example of the fondness the poet of this hymn has for parallel but disharmonious constructions.

Rather than trying to identify a particular divinity as the ásura- in this simile (Re: Varuṇa; Ge: “die Asura”), I concur with Hale (Asuras, 68-69) that this probably refers simply to a rich human lord who would be distinguished by his fine clothing.

In the frame the nirṇíj- would be the ghee with which Agni is bepoured. Cf. V.62.4 ghrtásya nirn ̥ íg; sim. VII.64.1, IX.82.2.
