The exclamation with which the hymn opens, báḍ, has a very un-Indo-Aryan shape, with a plain b and an unmotivated retroflex ḍ. This ḍ becomes ḷ before words beginning with a vowel, showing the standard Ṛgvedic intervocalic change -- which, interestingly, operates across word boundary here and in the 7 other passages in which báḍ is followed by a vowel; in VIII.101.11 it becomes ṇ before a nasal, in VIII.101.12 a ṭ before s. In 4 of its occurrences, incl. this one, it is immediately followed by itthā́; the combined sense of the two particles escapes me. The nonSanskritic phonology of báḍ suggests that there is a colloquial flavor to the word, but it is hard to capture exactly what that is -- esp. as the rest of the vs. doesn’t show markedly low register features.

Note the phonetic figures párvatānām# … pṛthivi# (ab), #prá … pravatvati# (c), and #mahnā́… mahini# (d), all positioned at pāda boundaries and all involving a fem. voc. as the 2nd word. The first two pairs of course also play off each other.

This first verse presents an unsurprising picture of the earth, weighed down by mountains whose slopes define her and providing support for the life that flourishes upon her. This vs. serves as scene-setter and contrast to vs. 2.
