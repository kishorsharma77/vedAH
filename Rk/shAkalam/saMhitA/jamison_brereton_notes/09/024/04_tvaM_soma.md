Although in the publ. tr. pāda c is unequivocally applied to Soma (“you who are …”), the text is ambiguous: the rel. cl. of pāda c, sásnir yó anumā́dyaḥ, could have either Soma or Indra (under the epithet carṣaṇīsáh-, which ends the preceding pāda) as antecedent.

In IX anumā́dya- is otherwise used of Soma, including two vss. later (24.6) as well as 76.1, 107.11, but it applies to Indra in VI.34.2. Since Indra was just called “conquerer of territories,” the use of sásni- ‘winner’ for the subj. of anumā́dya- makes Indra a distinct possibility. I think the ambiguity is meant; this is another ex. of the trade-off of identities discussed ad vs. 2. See further below.
