On the basis both of the content of the verse and the use of the voc. maryāḥ, I consider this verse to be Indra’s address to the Maruts. The plural of maryá in all clear cases refers to the Maruts. And in VIII.96.7-8 the Maruts address Indra, reminding him that all the other gods but them deserted him, using the same √īṣ ‘shrink from’ as is found here.

Ge takes ámithitaḥ as “ohne Zank” (without a quarrel), but I think it refers instead to Indra’s potentially friendless state --‘unpaired’ - a fear expressed by the poet in the immediately preceding verse (36). The hypothetical speaker still has a comrade (sákhā sákhāyam), but, like one unpaired, threatens to say to this comrade “I’m leaving.” The form jahā́is taken by Ge (and others) as a 3rd sg. pf. to √hā and therefore, implicitly, a precious example of a 3rd sg. pf. to a long-ā root without -au ending.

However, Old very persuasively suggests that it is a 1st sg. subjunctive in the direct speech introduced by abravīt. Although to the reduplicated present of √hā we would expect accent on the reduplication (*jáhā), Old argues that the fluctuation of accent in IIIrd class presents makes the accent irrelevant. I would alternatively suggest that it could be a subjunctive to the perfect stem. See Old’s extensive discussion of the various previous proposals about this form.
