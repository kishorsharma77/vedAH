The publ. tr. reflects the emendation of vájraṃ to *vrajáṃ, in concert with Gr, Ge, Schmidt (B+I, 137), Lub, and, after some resistance, Old. The resulting phrase ā́dartā *vrajám has a close parallel in VI.66.8 vrajáṃ dártā, as Ge points out.

Ge takes *vrajám as part of the simile and supplies Vala as the object in the frame: “… erbricht wie einen festen Pferch (den Vala)…” But the position of the simile marker ná speaks against this. I instead take *vrajám as a reference to Vala, with the simile portraying the attack of a wild beast (bhīmáḥ) on a real pen (thus effectively reading *vrajám twice and separating bhīmáḥ from Indra). For bhīmá- as a wild beast see mṛgó ná bhīmáḥ (I.154.2, 190.3), siṃhó ná bhīmáḥ (IV.16.4 [nearby], IX.97.28), etc. In their tr. WG keep the transmitted text and tr. “Der Furchtbare ist der die Keule Stiebende (in den) … prallen (Pferch) …,” thus silently incorporating a *vrajám in the final parenthesis (“Pferch”). I am also not certain what the VP “die Keule stieben” would mean nor how (ā́) √dṛ can mean ‘stieben’. They acknowledge the generally accepted emendation in their notes. Although I do not see an easy way to avoid this emendation, I do not know how the corruption could have arisen, esp. given vrajám apavartā́si in 8b. Still, vájra- is considerably more common than vrajá- and would always be lurking in an Indra context.
