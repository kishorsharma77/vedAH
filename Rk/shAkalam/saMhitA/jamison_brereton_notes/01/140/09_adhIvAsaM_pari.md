The hapax tuvigrá- in b is generally interpr. as having a thematized form of √gṝ ‘swallow’ as 2nd member, hence ‘powerfully swallowing’ vel sim. But to a seṭ root we should probably expect *-gira- (like -tír-: -tira-; (-)túr-: túra-). I follow instead a suggestion of Insler’s, that it represents a haplologized *tuvi-vigrá- ‘powerfully spirited’.

With most, I take śyénī as the fem. of the color term śyetá-, rather than, with Ge, as the fem. of śyená- ‘falcon’ (Adlerweibchen). Among other things, we would probably expect the fem. of ‘falcon’ to have vṛkī́- inflection, like vṛkī́- itself and siṃhī́- ‘lioness’ to siṃhá- ‘lion’; it should therefore have suffixal accent, and in this sandhi context the nom. sg. should have come out as *śyenī́ḥ. Moreover there is no obvious role for a female falcon in context. The white trail of ash here contrasts nicely with the black furrows (kṛṣṇásīta-) the fire creates in 4b.
