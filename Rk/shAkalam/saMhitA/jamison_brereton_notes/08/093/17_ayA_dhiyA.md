The verse is syntactically incomplete, consisting of an instrumental phrase (pāda a), a vocative phrase (pāda b), and a subordinate clause with a verb in the imperfect (ā́-abhavaḥ, so Pp.) or possibly injunctive (ā́bhavaḥ). In order to provide a main clause for the yád clause, Ge supplies “geschah es” (“it happened”). I prefer to borrow the verb of the preceding verse, ā́śuṣe, though transposed into a past tense.
