Ge and Re (also Ober II.43) attach c to d as a new sentence, but this makes the already somewhat difficult simile in c all the more puzzling: what does depositing his seed have to do with displaying his eloquence? Whereas b and c work better together: in b “Soma sits in the cups” - that is, the liquid soma is poured into receptacles, expressed in the loc. (camū́ṣu). In c this same transfer of liquid is compared to depositing seed/semen (réta ādádhat) in an animal, also in the loc. (paśaú). So the structural parallelism between simile and frame is exact. The problem is the loc. paśaú, for morphologically this should be masc. or at best neut., but the image is of impregnation, and for that we want a fem. My ad hoc solution is to assume that paśú- here is used as a collective ‘livestock’, in reference to stockbreeding as a general practice.
