This ultimate insider, “the closest one” of 5d, is immediately picked up by the slightly more distanced “closer ones” (ávarāsaḥ) in 6a. Here their comparative closeness is not contrasted with previous generations of Indra’s comrades, as in vs. 5, but with the older, distant deeds of Indra. These closer one are “asking” (pṛchántaḥ) about Indra. Their asking may refer directly to the questions in vs. 4, but it also implies that, however “close” they are, they do not have direct access to knowledge about Indra.

The limits on our knowledge are explicitly acknowledged in the 2nd hemistich, where we praise Indra only insofar as know him (yā́d evá vidmá). This subordinated expression is embedded in the larger clause: árcāmasi …, yā́d evá vidmá tā́t tvā mahā́ntam, where the obj. of árcāmasi is tvā, but the yā́d … tā́d diptych is clearly formulaic and frozen. This expression reminds us slightly of the yó vídānaḥ of 2b, likewise with √vid ‘know’ and likewise technically embedded.
