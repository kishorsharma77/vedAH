Whatever the reason for the pf. ruruce in vs. 1, its semi-repetition in the aor.

aroci in 2d inaugurates a pattern of lexical chaining in the first part of this hymn.

víśvam opening the vs. may pick up víśvaṃ jīvám “every living thing” of the previous vs. or anticipate víśvam in 3d, where I supply ‘world’.

In c the bahuvrīhi sudṛ́śīka-saṃdṛś- ‘having an appearance lovely to see’ is an internal etymological figure, … dṛ́śīka- … dṛś-. Since the final segment of the cmpd, underlying -ś (or rather the product of nom sg. -ś+s), appears as -g in sandhi, it echoes the -k- of the prior member: sudṛ́śīka-saṃdṛg.
