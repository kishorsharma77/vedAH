The acc. phrases tisráḥ parāvátaḥ, divó víśvāni rocanā́, and trī́m̐r aktū́n are all accusatives of extent and presented as if they were parallel; the specification ‘three’ in the first and last underlines this supposed parallelism. But the first two express extent of space and the third extent of time. A better tr. might be “you fly around the three far distances (and? see below) all the luminous realms of heaven for or during three nights. I do not know what “three nights” refers to: there is no parallel locution elsewhere and the standard tr. do not comment. It may simply reflect the common association of the Aśvins with triplets of various sorts. See esp.

I.34, which does have a roughly similar expression: I.34.7 tríḥ … divé-dive “Three times, day after day …” As for the first two accusative phrases, the rocanā́(ni) are regularly qualified as ‘three’, so “all the luminous realms” may be synonymous with immediately preceding “the three far distances” (a phrase also found in I.34.7 and VIII.32.22).
