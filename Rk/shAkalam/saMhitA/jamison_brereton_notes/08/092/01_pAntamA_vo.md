I separate the predicates of pādas a and b because √gā ‘sing’ seems to be used in two different senses, with two different sets of preverbs: ā́in a, abhí prá in b

- the first “sing (s.o.) to (come to) X [acc.],” the second “sing to s.o.”
pā́ntam here belongs to the nominal stem pā́nta- ‘drink’, not the pres. part., but the coincidence of form may have led to some ambiguity.
