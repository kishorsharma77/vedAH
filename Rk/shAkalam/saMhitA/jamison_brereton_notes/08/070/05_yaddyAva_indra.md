The conjoined NPs in ab display a neat chiasmus: dyā́vaḥ … śatáṃ, śatám bhū́mīḥ. This may help account for the placement of the utá after the second term (indeed after the entire second term: śatám bhū́mīr utá). Although XY utá structures are by no means uncommon (see Klein DGRV I.344-53), they are considerably rarer than the standard X utá Y type.

In cd there are two parallel nominal subjects, pl. sahásraṃ sū́ryāḥ and du.

ródasī, and neither matches the sg. verb ánu … aṣṭa in number. Several solutions have been proposed. BR (see Old) and Gr take ródasī as singular, but all other examples of sg. ródasī (and more common rodasī́) refer to the goddess of that name; when ródasī refers to the world-halves, it is always dual. Old also cites Ge Komm for the view that the sg. verb was influenced by sahásram. I am inclined to assume that the sg. verb split the difference between the plural and dual subjects, and it is also possible that the construction was somehow syntactically calqued on the inherited neuter plural subject + singular verb construction (though neither of the subjects is neuter). It’s also worth noting that the root aor. 3rd du. middle of √(n)aś is not attested, and in fact, acdg. to Macdonell, Vedic Gr., the only 2nd or 3rd du. mid. root aor. attested is adhītām (X.4.6, √dhā) -- so the poet may have been a bit insecure about what the du. form ought to be (*aśātām? *aṣṭāṃ?), and the pl. sū́ryāḥ may have been too distant in the vs. to allow the 3rd pl. aśata to be used instead.
