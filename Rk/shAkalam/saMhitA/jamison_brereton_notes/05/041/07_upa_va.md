The hymn contains three exx. of éṣe (5b, 7a, 8d). Though Lub classifies them all as locc. to the thematic stem éṣa-, I follow the standard tr. in taking the one in this vs. as a 1st sg. pres., while the other two are locc. in the phrase rāyá éṣe “in the quest for wealth.” The parallel for 7a cited by Ge, I.186.4 úpa va éṣe … uṣā́sānáktā, seems to clinch this interpr., and the next vs. (8), beginning abhí vo arce, also PREV vaḥ 1st - sg. VERB, reinforces it. In d I read ā́hā not ā́hā (a change only in the Pp. not the Saṃhitā text), and analyze this sequence as ā́+ áhā, the neut. pl. of ‘day’. This is one of only two supposed exx. of the particle ha with long vowel; the other one (IV.31.5) also follows ā́and is susceptible to the same analysis. See disc. there.
