It does not seem worthwhile to try to replicate the difference between the two reduplicated forms, the intensive participle (śośucat) and the perfect imperative (śuśugdhi) in tr. — Re’s tr. of the inten. part., “écartant-par-ton-éclat-puissant,” is a cautionary example of why. WG’s “immer wieder wegflammend” is somewhat less clunky but still gets wearisome in repetition.
