Both Ge and Schmidt take the first hemistich as depicting a hostile encounter between two sets of men and heroes expressed by the verb nīḷáyāse (Ge: “… dass du Herren mit Herren, Mannen mit Mannen in Kampf verwickeln wirst?”; HPS [153] “… dass du … handgemein (?) werden lässt?”); Old is less certain but suggests that “kämpfen machen, überwinden” is expected. But the basis of this hapax demon. nīḷáyāse, namely nīḷá- ‘nest’, invites an interpr. depicting a more intimate and amicable relationship (like the adj. sánīḷa- ‘of the same nest’, referring to brothers and comrades), and the middle voice reinforces that sense. In my 1983 monograph on -áya-formations, I follow an interpr. suggested by Insler, that the verb means ‘accept as equals’ (pp. 84-85). Although I think that may be an implication, I now think it can be taken more literally: ‘put in your own nest’. Indra is bringing our fighting men into intimate contact with his own (the Maruts and/or Aṅgirases [the latter being mentioned in vs. 5]) under his auspices; with these now conjoined forces he can win the contests and the cattle at stake.

The accent of the denom. nīḷáyāse (expect *nīḷayā́se) has been retracted because the form is transitive (acc. nṛ́̄n … vīrā́n) and has been attracted into the -áyatransitive / causative class (see my 1983 monograph).
