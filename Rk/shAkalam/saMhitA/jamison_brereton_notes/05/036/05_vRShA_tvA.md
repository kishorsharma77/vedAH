I take cd as a single clause (contra Ge [/WG]), because the sá with 2nd ps. ref.

that opens c is easily explained if it’s construed with the imperatival 2nd sg. injunctive dhāḥ at the end of d, but would otherwise be anomalous. See my “sa figé.” Strictly speaking, vṛ́ṣakrato is of course a voc. In the publ. tr. I render it as nom., because of the parallelism vṛ́ṣā vṛ́ṣarathaḥ … vṛ́ṣakrato vṛ́ṣā, with 2 nom. vṛ́ṣā adjoining 2 bahuvrīhis with vṛ́ṣa- as 1st member.
