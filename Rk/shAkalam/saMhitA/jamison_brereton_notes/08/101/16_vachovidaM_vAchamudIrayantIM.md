According to the transmitted text, this hymn ends on a downbeat: the small-witted man (dabhrácetāḥ), the last word of the hymn, has taken possession (avṛkta) of the cow that has been so extravagantly praised in vss. 15-16, whose right to safety was proclaimed to “observant people” or “the observant man” (cikitúṣe jánāya 15c), the opposite of the small-witted man of 16d. This sad finale seems unlikely to me, and a small emendation to the text will change the tone entirely.

Instead of ā́māvṛkta at the beginning of pāda d, I suggest reading *mā́mā vṛkta. The second part, mā vṛkta, instead of the Pp. mā avṛkta, does not alter the Saṃhitā text.

As for reading the prohibitive negative mā́for preverb ā́, note that the preceding pāda ends with gā́m, and in the sequence … gā́m mā́the pāda-spanning -m m- could well have been degeminated. The posited *mā́may or may not also contain the preverb ā́. Since √vṛj generally appears with a preverb, it probably does. Restoring

*mā́also makes the pāda more parallel to 15d mā́gā́m …, which also contains a mā́
prohibitive with a cow as obj.
