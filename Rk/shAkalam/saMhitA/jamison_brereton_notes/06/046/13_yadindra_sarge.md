The form árvataḥ ends the first pāda of this vs. and the last of vs. 1, but with different grammatical identities: gen. sg. in 1d, acc. pl. here. This difference may be one indication that this pragātha both responds to the rest of the hymn and distances itself from it.

mahādhané is repeated from 4c.
