Strongly resolved (to sacrifice), installed in front in every house, Agni is  attentive to the sacrifice, to the ceremony—through his resolve he is  attentive to the sacrifice.  
Through his resolve he is a ritual expert for the straight-arrow; he has  watched over all beings  
from the time when as guest he was born splendid with ghee—as the  conveyor (of the offering), the ritual expert, he was born.
