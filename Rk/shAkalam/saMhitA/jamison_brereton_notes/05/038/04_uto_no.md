The brief excursion into the dual in vs. 3 is over, and Indra is the sole subject again.

The first hemistich is again syntactically incomplete. The standard interpr.

construe the genitive phrase asyá kásya cid dákṣasya táva loosely with nṛmṇám (e.g., Ge “von welcher deiner Geisteskraft es auch sei, … bring uns Mut”). This is possible, but I prefer to take ab as an extension of 3cd (as 3ab was to 2cd), supplying ‘rule’ to govern the genitives, using slightly different senses of ‘rule’.
