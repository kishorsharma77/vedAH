Ge takes diví as ‘at day(break)’, but this loc. is almost always used of heaven (so also Re), save for a few expressions like pūrvyám diví “early in the day” (II.22.4, VIII.22.6) and diví pā́rye “on the decisive day” (VI.17.14, etc.) and the cmpd. diviyáj- (IX.97.26) ‘sacrificing in the day’. To make this locative work, I see the hemistich as containing two slightly different constructions, both involving cakrire. I supply that verb from b to govern the accusatives in pāda a, where it has the straightforward sense “made X.” But in pāda b, governing the acc. + loc., it means rather “make X (to be) in Y,” i.e., “put X in Y.” It is possible that the second acc. in a, ā́hutim, also participates in that construction (“make the poured oblation [to be] in heaven”), but it is unlikely that védim does: the altar is surely earthbound. And since Agni is said to be ‘bepoured’ (ā́hutaḥ) in the next vs. (19a, also 22d, 23a, 25c), the poured oblation may well stay on earth too.
