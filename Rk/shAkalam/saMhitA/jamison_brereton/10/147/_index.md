Indra  
Suvedas Śairīṣi  
5 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 5  
The poet begins his hymn (vs. 1, 2ab) by proclaiming his trust in Indra’s “battle  fury” (manyú), on the basis of the god’s deeds and his dominance over the cosmic  spaces. It turns out that the poet has something more than simply praise on his  mind. Indra and his battle fury are much in demand among men in search of vic  
tory and its spoils (vs. 2cd), and the poet recommends his patrons to Indra’s atten tion and care (vs. 3). He realizes, however, that securing Indra’s help requires proper  ritual observance (vs. 4). The hymn ends (vs. 5) with explicit requests for Indra’s aid  and bounty, such desires having been only indirectly expressed earlier in the hymn.
