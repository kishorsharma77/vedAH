Agni
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: dvipadā triṣṭubh
Quite reasonably, Oldenberg holds that this hymn, the last of the Agni hymns of  VII, is an addition to the original collection. It is a general description of the prepa rations for the sacrifice (vss. 1, 2), its performance (vss. 3, 4), and its rewards (vs.  5). The last two verses reaffirm the relationship of Agni to the gods (vs. 6) and to  mortals (vs. 7).
## 1
Agni, be kindled by our good kindling and let the ritual grass become  spread widely.
## 2
And let the eager doors gape open, and, (o Agni), convey the eager gods  here to this place.
## 3
Agni, pursue them with the offering, sacrifice to the gods. Make the rites  good, Jātavedas.
## 4
Jātavedas will make the rites good. He will sacrifice to the gods, and he  will please the immortals.
## 5
Win all desirable rewards, o attentive one, and let our hopes come  true today.
## 6
And, o Agni, the gods have established you here as the conveyor of  oblations, as the child of nourishment.
## 7
We would be those serving you, the god. Being beseeched, you will grandly  distribute treasures to us.
