As indicated in the publ. intro., this hymn is divided into tṛcas and each tṛca was probably originally a single hymn. This then is the final verse of 1-3, and it exhibits very heavy ring-composition: 3b … úpa yāhi vītáye reprises 1a úpa no yāhi vītáye almost exactly, and 3ab … niyúdbhiḥ śatínibhiḥ … sahasrínibhiḥ … echoes 1bc sahásreṇa niyútā … śatínībhiḥ. Note also 3d távāyám bhāgáḥ …, which is identical to the beginning of 2d.

As discussed ad I.134.3, the expression here, sáraśmiḥ sū́rye sácā “accompanying the reins [=rays] when the sun (rises)” seems to me a fuller version of the temporal expression raśmíṣu (/raśmíbhiḥ) “at/with the reins=rays.” See also I.137.2e sākáṃ sū́ryasya raśmíbhiḥ “simultaneous with the reins=rays of the sun.”
