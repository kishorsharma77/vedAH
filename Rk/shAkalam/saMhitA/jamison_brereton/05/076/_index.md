Aśvins  
Atri Bhauma  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
In the later ritual the Hotar recites this hymn in the evening as the Adhvaryu and  his assistants fan the fire to heat the Pravargya vessel. Verse 1 refers directly to the  hot milk oblation offered to the Aśvins in the Pravargya ritual, but, as Houben  (2000: 10) observes, the hymn itself indicates the dawn as the time of its recitation.  Time is a central theme of the hymn: it is now that the Aśvins are praised (vs. 2),  and at present the oblation is extended to the Aśvins (vs. 3). The Aśvins should  respond to the praise and the offering because they come at all times, both day and  night (vss. 2, 3). Because of the present offering and the ever-presence of the Aśvins,  the poet hopes for the Aśvins’ “present help” (vs. 5).  
Although perhaps not as strongly, the poet puts a similar emphasis on place.  The Aśvins should “journey here” (vs. 1, 3), where they are praised (vs. 2), for this  is their place, home, house, and dwelling (vs. 4). The result is that wealth and good  fortune will be here (vs. 5).
