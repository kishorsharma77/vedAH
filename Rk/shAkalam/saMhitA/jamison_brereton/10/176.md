Agni [or, according to the Anukramaṇı, R̄ ̥bhus (1),  Agni (2–4)]
Sūnu Ārbhava
4 verses: anuṣṭubh, except gāyatrī 2
A simple hymn treating the ritual fire on its first appearance. The only real difficulty  is found in verse 4. Although the precise meaning of the first hemistich is disputed,  it seems to these readers that this verse almost paradoxically frees Agni from his  birth as a god in order to situate him firmly in the mortal sphere, where human life  takes place: the theme of Agni’s “dual citizenship” is a common one in the R̥gveda.
## 1
The sons of the R̥bhus [=flames], their circles, bellow out loftily— they who, deriving all nourishment, feed upon (heaven and) earth as if  on a mother cow.
## 2
Bring forward the god Jātavedas with a godly insight.
He will convey our oblations in their proper order.
## 3
This Hotar right here, seeking the gods, is led forth to sacrifice.
Decked out like the chariot of a traveler, he comes into view, glowing  with heat, in his own person.
## 4
This Agni delivers himself from his immortal birth, as it were.
Stronger even than strength, the god was created for living.
