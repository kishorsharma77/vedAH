Ge takes ójasā as belonging to the enemy and providing the content of their boast: “der sich mit seiner Stärke grosstut.” But since ójasā is almost always pādafinal no matter what part of the vs. it belongs with and since Indra’s ójas- is usually what is referred to, I take it as Indra’s.

The comparative śáśīyas- occurs only twice in the RV, once in a very slangy passages referring to a woman (V.61.6), in a usage that does not illuminate this one.

Context in our passage favors the rendering ‘more numerous’ (so also Gr, Ge), given its contrast with dabhrébhiś cid “with only a few.” The question is how to get from the positive śáśvant- ‘each and every, one after another, successive, recurrent, continual’ to a comparative ‘more numerous’. The English expression “they just keep coming, more and more” might be the clue. WG incorporate the literal sense of śáśvant- but seem not to render the comparative: “die der Reihe nach erscheinenden.” See disc. of sácā ad IV.31.5-6.
