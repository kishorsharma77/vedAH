The abstract bāhútā- ‘arm-ness’ or ‘collectivity of arms’ occurs twice in the RV (otherwise in I.41.2). I think it must refer to the quintessential qualify of arms, namely strength (see bāhv-òjas- ‘having the strength of arms, armstrong’). Here, in the simile I think the point is that Mitra and Varuṇa guide the chariot with their supernatural skill (daṃsánā) as if with physical arms, the tools that less exalted charioteers would use. The arms of the two gods are found in the next pragātha, 4d.
