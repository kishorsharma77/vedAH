viśvámānuṣa- should, by accent, be a bahuvrīhi; it is also difficult to separate from viśvámanus- in the next hymn (VIII.46.17). However, most interpretors take it implicitly as a karmadhāraya: Gr ‘die ganze Menschenschar’, Ge ‘jedermann’, and Wackernagel (AiG II.1.266) explicitly identifies it as a tatpuruṣa with irregular accent (‘Gesamtheit der Menschen’). But this seems unnecessary: mā́nuṣa- regularly modifies jána- (so ‘human race’ / or ‘folk consisting of the descendants of Manu’), and here we can supply an underlying jána-, modified by the compound, hence ‘(races) consisting of all the people of Manu’. The publ. tr. seems to reflect the tatpuruṣa interpretation because the more literal tr. is simply too awkward.
