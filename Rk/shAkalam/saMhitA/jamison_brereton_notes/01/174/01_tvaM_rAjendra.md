All the standard tr. (also, e.g., Schlerath, Königtum 143, Hale Asura- 70, Oberlies ReligRV II.177) construe the rel. cl. yé ca devā́(ḥ) loosely (very loosely) with rā́jā (e.g., Ge “Du, Indra, bist der König über alle Götter,” which entails not only assuming that rā́jā can govern such a clause, but also ignoring the ca). Within the same general interpr. framework WG do try to account for the ca: “… der König über (alle), auch die die Götter sind.” This can all be avoided by interpr. the rel. cl. as part of the familiar syntagm “X and which Y,” but in an inverse version with the conjoined rel. cl. first (rather like the inverse Vāyav Indraś ca construction with the ca constituent first ): yé ca devā́ḥ, … nṝ́n. Re, fld by Klein (DGRV I.127), does interpret it as an “X and which Y construction,” but supplies a gen. “of mortals” with rā́jā: “… le roi (des hommes) et de (ceux) qui (sont) les dieux.” This is unnec.

because rákṣā can govern the conjoined NP. It is accented because it opens the pāda.

Another intricate “X and which Y” construction is found in vs. 3 (by my interpr).

WG unaccountably take rákṣā absolutely and construe nṝ́n with pāhí, which is ungrammatical because pāhí is accented; its object (asmā́n) follows.
