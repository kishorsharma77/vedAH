Both Ge and Re supply an intermediate infinitive to govern víśvāni kā́vyā: “um alle Sehergabe zu gewinnen” and “en vue de (nous procurer) tous pouvoirs-poétiques” respectively - on what basis is completely unclear to me. I see no reason why it can’t simply be a goal, as I’ve taken it. See also comm. ad IX.75.1.
