Most of the contents of this vs. conform to the characteristics of Pūṣan elsewhere in this cycle, even dhiyaṃjinvá- ‘quickening poetic vision’ (see esp.

VI.53), but “fitted into all creation” (bhúvane víśve arpitaḥ) and “surveying the creatures” (saṃcákṣāṇo bhúvanā) attribute to him a more cosmic role than usual. His speeding (īyate) may be a reference to his travels between earth and heaven referred to above, ad vs. 1.

víśve is one of two loc. sg. to this stem with the noun ending -e (the other being IV.16.9), but the pronomina víśvasmin is also only found twice, both times in X.
