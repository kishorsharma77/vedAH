The question about práyajyu- is how technically it is meant; I here follow Re.

The first hemistich recalls vs. 11 in the previous hymn, esp. in the bahuvrīhi rukmá-vakṣas- ‘with brilliants on their breasts’ (lit. ‘having breasts with brillants on them’, of the vájra-bāhu- type), which matches the nominal phrase V.54.11b vákṣassu rukmā́, but also in bhrā́jad-ṛṣti- ‘having glinting spears’, whose members are distributed differently in 54.11a áṃseṣu … ṛṣṭáyaḥ and b agníbhājasaḥ.

The idiom śúbham √yā is used of the Maruts elsewhere, in nearby V.57.2 as well as I.23.11; cf. also the cmpds śubhaṃ-yā́(van)-. My “drove in beauty” is of course a conscious echo of Byron’s “She walks in beauty, like the night.” A different kind of English resonance would be offered by “gone to glory.”
