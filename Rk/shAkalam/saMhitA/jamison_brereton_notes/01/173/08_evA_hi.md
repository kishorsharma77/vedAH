Ge’s assessment that the vs. refers to the mixing of soma with water (a) and milk (b) seems correct. As often in soma contexts, the rhetoric is high-flown and the real-world references indirect.

The āsú of b must anticipate the cow(s) of c; it is presumably accented because its referent has not yet appeared in the discourse.

Both Ge and Re endow the gerundive jóṣyā with caus. pass. value ‘to be satisfied’ (“Jede zu befriedigende Kuh,” “Toute vache propre à être satisfaite”), but even the “causative” joṣáyate doesn’t have this value, but simply means ‘enjoys’.

The cows are surely there for Indra to enjoy them, not for him to labor to give them enjoyment.

Note that the idiom ánu √mad ‘applaud’ found in anumádanti in 7d is broken down into its components, with mádanti in our pāda b and ánu in c.

My tr. of dhiṣā́follows that of Pinault given orally at the Vedic Workshop at Univ. Texas, 2007.
