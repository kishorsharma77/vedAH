Agni Vaiśvānara
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
9 verses: jagatī 1–6, triṣṭubh 7–9, arranged in trcas ̥
The deities and attribution of the hymn are more complicated than indicated above.  The hymn comprises three tr̥cas: the first set of three verses is to Agni Vaiśvānara, the  second to the Maruts, and the third begins with Agni’s self-praise in verse 7 and then  continues with the poet’s description of Agni in verses 8–9. This is one way to regard  the hymn. Geldner offers another, quite plausible analysis. According to him, the first  tr̥ca contains verses to accompany the kindling of Agni. In the second the newly cre
ated Agni is fanned with the help of the Maruts. The third tr̥ca is entirely the speech  of Agni. It begins with the god’s praise of himself and then continues with the god’s  praise of the poet. Bergaigne argues that the Āgnimāruta śastra in the later ritual  consists of three major parts addressed to Vaiśvānara, the Maruts, and Jātavedas and  suggests that this hymn represents an old Āgnimāruta śastra. Oldenberg disagrees  with both Geldner and Bergaigne, holding that the hymn does not possess the kind  of unity that either asserts. In his translation of Agni hymns (1897), he describes the  three tr̥cas as “three independent hymns” because of the placement of the hymn in the  collection; that is, it has more verses than the preceding hymns, while in the normal  arrangement it should have the same number of verses or fewer.
Despite its placement in the collection and the change of meter, we believe that  Geldner and Bergaigne are correct in seeing a coherence to the hymn and find  Bergaigne’s suggestion that this is an early Āgnimāruta śastra an attractive one.
