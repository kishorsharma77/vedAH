Most take hári-priya- as ‘loving the hári’ (e.g., Re “qui aimes les alezans”); I have reversed the direction of affection: “dear to the fallow bays,” primarily because better attested puru-priyá- means ‘dear to many’ not ‘loving many’, though the accent difference between them may signal a difference in meaning. (However, the special accentual behavior of compounded puru- muddies the waters.)
