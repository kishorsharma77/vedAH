This vs. is rather cleverer than the two that precede it. In pāda a the nom. pl. root noun hrútaḥ is, in my opinion, a pun. It belongs to the root √hvṛ ‘go crookedly, curve’, and its sense was disc., e.g., by KH (Fs. Thieme [1980] =Aufs. III.753-54). He suggests that here it refers to unevennesses (Unebenheiten) in the fleece sieve (i.e., as I see it, the curvy tufts of wool), just as, in the other occurrence of this root noun (VI.4.5), it refers to the curves of a race course (see comm. ad loc.). The literal sense here then is that though the soma must navigate around the tufts on the sieve, they will not keep it from completing the course. The second sense is one referring to unscrupulous enemies—Engl. ‘crook’ is an exact semantic match—and the point is that when Soma wishes to dispense goods to us, our crooked enemies can’t divert him.

The word family that includes makhá- and the denom. makhasyá- found here displays both ‘combat’ and ‘generosity’ senses; see comm. ad I.18.9 and, for the verb, III.31.7. Here I think both are at play, and this double sense is encouraged by the context: as noted, this tṛca focuses on combatting enemies, and the first hemistich of this vs. states that these enemies cannot stop Soma. But the tṛca also concerns Soma’s giving, esp. in the last two vss.: 26a “bring wealth ... 26c “give” … 27b “eager to give largesse.”
