Indra
Medhātithi Kāṇva
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged for the most part in trcas ̥
The hymn begins with a call to the Kaṇva poets to praise Indra’s great deeds, and  the next two verses (2–3) provide a quick catalogue of Indra’s victories over several  of his lesser known opponents. This theme, with some of the same names/epithets,  returns at the end of the hymn (esp. vss. 25–27). In between we find the usual twin  exhortations to Indra—to come to our soma sacrifice (rather than that of others;  see esp. vss. 21–22) and to give us wealth and aid. The reciprocal obligation of the  sacrificers and the recipient of sacrifice is nicely expressed in verse 16, where Indra’s  debt to (other) sacrificers has been discharged by his countergift.
There is nothing of particular note in this hymn, though it is nicely executed. It  also contains several hapaxes and words with apparently non-Indo-Aryan phonol ogy, especially toward the beginning, that give it a slightly exotic air.
The internal structure of the hymn is not entirely clear. We follow Oldenberg’s  analysis, whereby the hymn consists of tr̥cas plus a final verse (30) save for verses  19–20, which form an incomplete tr̥ca with perhaps a verse missing. However, the  tr̥cas thus identified show little internal unity.1094 VIII.32
