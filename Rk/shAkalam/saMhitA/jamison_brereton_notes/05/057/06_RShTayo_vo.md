The pf. that ends the vs., pipiśe, produces a bad cadence that would be fixed by a heavy redupl. syllable. The metrical problem is not mentioned by Old or Kü; HvN note it but do not suggest a solution. I wonder if it is for intens. *pepiśe; the act.

intens. is found once in the late RV, while the middle begins to be attested in the AV, with a sense not appreciably different from non-intens. forms. Of course, the t-less ending -e would have to be accounted for, but several 3rd sg, med. intensives have such an ending; see Schaefer 44. Of course, this might all be more trouble than it’s worth for a metrical violation.
