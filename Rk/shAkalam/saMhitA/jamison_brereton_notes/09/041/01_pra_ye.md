This vs., consisting entirely of a rel. cl., is not resumed by a main cl. Vs. 2, which might be configured as the main cl., is couched in the 1st pl., not the 3rd pl. like vs. 1, and it also has a very different tone. There is no reason, with Re, to supply an anodyne introductory cl. “(Je chante les soma)” to provide a main cl. -- in fact, the abruptness of the expression and its incompleteness enhance the sense of violence.

As I indicated in the publ. intro., I think the unexpressed subj. is the soma juices. Many soma hymns begin with the soma rushing forth after its pressing, often compared to a horse or a bull charging; here the soma drinks are also likened to cattle, but stampeding cattle, and this uncontrollable mob tramples the enemy. So the poet has taken a standard opening trope and “weaponized” it, as it were.

This enemy is identified as the “black skin” (kṛṣṇā́m … tvácam). For this phrase as a designation of non-Ārya “without commandments” (avratá-) see I.130.8 and IX.73.5 (in the latter tvácam ásiknīm; see above). The term avratá- is found in the next vs. (2c).
