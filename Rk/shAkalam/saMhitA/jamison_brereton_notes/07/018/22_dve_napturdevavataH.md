The first two pādas begin the enumeration of the Paijavana’s dā́namentioned in c -- an enumeration continued in 23.

The simile in d, hóteva sádma páry emi, is one of the few clear references to the animal sacrifice, with this depicting the Paryagnikaraṇa; cf. IX.97.1, where the animals are explicit.
