As pointed out, e.g., by Ge, śáṃsāt in d must stand for *aghā́d śáṃsāt “from evil utterance,” borrowing the aghā́t of pāda a (and cf. the bahuvrīhi agháśaṃsa- ‘of evil speech’, referring to the utterer thereof). It may well be (with Ge, etc.) that śáṃsāt should likewise be supplied in a, but “guard from evil,” without the addition of “utterance,” is also perfectly acceptable.
