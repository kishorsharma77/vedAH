Savitar
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
4 verses: triṣṭubh
This simple hymn concentrates on Savitar as giver of goods and human necessities,  though several of his other characteristic acts are mentioned, notably the raising  of his golden arms (vs. 2) and the daily bringing to rest and impelling forth of the  living world (vs. 1).
## 1
Let god Savitar drive here, possessed of good treasure, filling the
midspace, journeying with his horses,
holding many things meant for men in his hand, bringing the world to  rest and impelling it forth.
## 2
His two golden arms, pliant and lofty, have reached up to the ends of heaven. Now this greatness of his has been marveled at. Even the sun has ceded  to him his task.
## 3
The overpowering god Savitar will impel good things here as the lord  of goods.
Spreading wide his broad emblem, he will then grant to us the
sustenance for mortals.
## 4
These songs here reverently invoke Savitar of good tongue and good  palms, whose fists are full.
Let him confer on us brilliant, lofty vigor. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.
