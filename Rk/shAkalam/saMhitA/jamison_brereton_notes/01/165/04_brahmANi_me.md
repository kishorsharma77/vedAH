The act. forms iyarti, etc., are usually transitive, but Old cites a few passages with the intrans. value that must also be present here.

Although various tr. (e.g., WG) take ukthā́as acc. pl. and supply subjects for the pl. verbs ā́śāsate and práti haryanti (men and gods respectively, WG), taking it as nom. pl. not only avoids the need to cast around for unexpressed subjects but also captures Indra’s extreme egotism: even the hymns long for him, or so he thinks.
