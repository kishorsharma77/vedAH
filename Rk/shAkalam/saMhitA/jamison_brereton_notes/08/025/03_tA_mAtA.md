Because the phrase asuryā̀ya prámahasā is found also in VII.66.2 (also of Mitra and Varuṇa), the two words must be construed together -- though in both instances Ge construes them separately (as do Re and W. E. Hale). Moreover Ge’s minimalist tr. of prámahas- (“Die … Erhabenen”) does not reflect its bahuvrīhi status: it should mean something like ‘having their greatness forth/in front’. In combination with the dat. asuryā̀ya, some forward motion seems indicated.
