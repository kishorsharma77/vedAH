The bull [=Soma] has milked out his draughts of milk for the bull  [=Indra] by the milking of heaven—he the youthfully exuberant,  
undeceivable (son) of Aditi.  
He [=Agni] knows everything, as Varuṇa does, through his insight. Let  him who is worthy of the sacrifice perform sacrifice throughout the  
sacrificial sequences.
