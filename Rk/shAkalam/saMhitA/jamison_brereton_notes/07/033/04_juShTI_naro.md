Ge appears to be right that this vs. is also Indra’s speech. He picks up the bráhmaṇā vaḥ from 3d in pāda a and also addresses them as ‘superior men’ (voc. naraḥ), just as he spoke about the superior men (acc. nṝ́n) in 1c.

Ge takes pitṝṇā́m with both júṣṭī and bráhmaṇā; I doubt the first, as does Old.

Since I think Indra is addressing the Vasiṣṭhas at the time of the battle, not a younger generation of Vasiṣṭhas long after the battle, his “by reason of your fathers’ sacred formulation” (bráhmaṇā vo pitṝṇā́m) must refer to the formulation they inherited from their own poetic forebears and are putting to use in enlisting Indra’s help.

The action Indra performs in response to the Vasiṣṭhas’ employment of the bráhman- is not altogether clear. (Old, after some speculation, concludes “'ich komme hier nicht zur Klarheit.”) The bare phrasing ákṣam avyayam must mean literally “I enveloped the/an axle,” but whose axle it is and whether the enveloping is a help or a hindrance aren’t recoverable from context. However, as Old points out, III.53.19 may provide some guidance. That vs. is addressed to an axle (voc. ákṣa) in a series of vss. (17-20) mean to avert possible disasters that might afflict a team of oxen and the vehicle they are pulling. In vs. 19 the axle is urged abhí vyayasva khadirásya sā́ram “Engird yourself in the hardwood of the Acacia tree,” before being told to be and stay firm (vīḷáyasva). The first instruction to the axle contains the verb (abhí) √vyā ‘envelop, engird’, which I take as referring to fixing the ends of the axle firmly in the wheel hubs till the ends are literally surrounded with / enveloped in the wood of the wheel hub. If the same type of action is referred to here, Indra is performing a positive action, presumably securing the axle of the Vasiṣṭhas or their allies in position, to protect them and their chariot from harm, as Indra promises with ná kílā riṣātha.

As Ge points out (n. 4c), śákvarī- is the name of a meter with martial associations. As he also points out, this fairly rare meter is found in the first three vss.

of X.133, a hymn to Indra attributed to Sudās Paijavana, that is, the royal hero of the Ten Kings Battle, though there is no particular ref. to that battle in X.133. Since śákvarīṣu is plural here, it would be better tr. “in Sakvarī (verses)” than “in Śakvarī (meter),” as in the publ. tr. 39
