The chariot which you, o vigorous Indra, lead forward to gain
wisdom, though it [=chariot] is far away—(which) you lead forward,  faultless one—
just in a single day you will make it to prevail as a prizewinner if you so  desire.
(Thrust forward) (this chariot) for us, the ritual adepts, you faultless  thruster—like this speech for (us,) the ritual adepts.
