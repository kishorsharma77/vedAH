Agni
Vītahavya Āṅgirasa or Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
19 verses: jagatī 1–2, śakvarī 3, jagatī 4–5, atiśakvarī 6, jagatī 7–9, triṣṭubh 10–14,  śakvarī 15, triṣṭubh 16, anuṣṭubh 17, brhati 18, tri ̥ ṣṭubh 19, arranged in trcas ̥
With its nineteen verses, this hymn as a unity would clearly be out of place in the  arrangement of the maṇḍala, but dissolved into a series of five independent tr̥cas, its  first fifteen verses fit well. The last four verses (16–19) are considered by Oldenberg  (1888: 194) to be a later addition, and their vocabulary shows certain signs of com
parative modernity. The content of these triads is generally unremarkable, concentrating on the  installation of the ritual fire, Agni’s sacrificial role as envoy between gods and  men, and the ritual service performed for him by mortals. To some extent the tr̥cas  seem to be exercises in variation; for example, the first verses of the first two tr̥cas  (1, 4) share some key words and phrases and can in part be interpreted by compari
son with each other.
