Klein (DGRV II.122) ascribes “logical conjunctive value ‘therefore’” to ádha here, connecting vss. 3 and 4. But since vs. 4 begins a new tṛca, it seems unlikely that vs. 4 is being conjoined to the tṛca-final vs. 3. Moreover, ádha here is displaced from its usual pāda-initial position to immediately precede dvitā́, as it does several times elsewhere (I.132.3, VIII.1.28, 84.2, all pāda-final as here; also pāda-initial VIII.13.24 = IX.102.1, VIII.83.8). On the preceding page (DGRV II.121) Klein calls ádha dvitā́a collocation and gives it “quasi-formulaic status.” The occurrence here must belong to this group.

In b bharató vājíbhiḥ “Bharata with his prize-winner” is an untranslatable pun on the poet’s name Bharad-vāja, whose name appears in the next vs. (5c).

The ritualistic verbs īḷe ‘reverently invoke’ (a) and ījé ‘sacrifice’ (c) are exact rhymes (save for accent). I take them here as 3rd sg. , as do Ge and Re. Although the 3rd sg. to the former stem is usually īṭṭ́ e with īḷ ́ e the 1st sg., in this context a 3rd sg. reading is favored, and the lack of accent on īḷe allows it to be drawn into the morphological orbit of the pf. ījé (cf. 3rd sg. perfect-accented īḍé in IV.3.3). Kü (389), flg. Tichy, takes both verbs as 1st sg., which is equally possible, as long as Bharata is referring to himself by name: “You do I, Bharata, reverently invoke …”
