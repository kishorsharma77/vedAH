Parjanya
Atri Bhauma
10 verses: triṣṭubh 1, 5–8, 10, jagatī 2–4, anuṣṭubh 9
Parjanya (“Thunder”) is the subject of only three hymns in the R̥gveda. This lovely  hymn, much translated, is reminiscent of the Marut hymns in this maṇḍala, though  not ascribed to the same poet. (The Maruts are addressed here in vs. 6.) Vivid images  of the power of the thunderstorm are mingled with expressions of thanks for the  fructifying effects of the accompanying rains, depicted as sexual in nature. In the last  verse the poet describes all the good Parjanya has done, but gently urges him to desist.
