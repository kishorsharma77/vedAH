vríś- is a hapax, but the generally accepted meaning ‘finger’ seems well supported by context. Though suggested etymological connections do not enforce this sense, they do allow it. See EWA II.597 and lit. referred to there.

In 5d I have followed the Pp. and tr. augmented adhita; however, as in 4c the sequence návādhita could be read návā dhita with injunc., which would have presential/timeless value to match the presents hinvanti (a), havāmahe (b), and ṛṇvati (c). Although no other unaug. dhita forms occur, there is no reason it should not exist.
