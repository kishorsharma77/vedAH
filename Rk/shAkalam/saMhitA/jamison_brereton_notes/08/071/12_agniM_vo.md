I supply “we beseech” as the verb, from the twin pragātha vs. 13c īmahe, despite the interruption by a clause containing nom. agníḥ (13ab).

kṣaítrāya sā́dhase has to be interpr. in connection with the cmpd. kṣetrasā́dhas- (III.8.7, VIII.31.14). Ge’s interp. “zur Schlichtung (des Streites) um ein Feld” [for the settlement (of conflict) regarding a field] seems unnecessarily specific and contextually unsupported.
