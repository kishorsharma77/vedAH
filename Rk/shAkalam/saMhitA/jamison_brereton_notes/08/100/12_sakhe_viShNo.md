For my hypothesis about the relevance of this verse to the rest of the hymn see the publ. intro. The verse is consciously modeled on vs. 2: the voc. sákhe in a picks up sákhā of 2c; hánāva vṛtrám in c echoes vṛtrā́ṇi jaṅghanāva bhū́ri. But, at least in my view and Old’s (though not Ge’s), the two addressees are not the same: Vāyu in 2 and Viṣṇu in 12. As I argued in the publ. intro. Viṣṇu may have been introduced here because his association with three may allow him to represent the Third Pressing in this hymn-length sketch of the ritual day. And, also presented in the intro., the apparent superimposition of Viṣṇu on Vāyu via the close similiarity of vss. 2 and 12 may have been an attempt to integrate the newly ascendant god Viṣṇu into the older inherited religion in which Vāyu is prominent.
