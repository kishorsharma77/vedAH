Aśvins
Brahmātithi Kāṇva
39 verses: gāyatrī, except br̥hatī 37–38, anuṣṭubh 39, all arranged in trcas ̥
This long hymn (at 39 verses the longest hymn to the Aśvins in the R̥gveda) presents  few difficulties and, correspondingly, few particular pleasures. Many pādas in the  hymn have exact or near counterparts elsewhere.
The hymn begins not with the Aśvins but with the appearance of the (unnamed)  Dawn (vs. 1), as a lead-in to the Aśvins’ early morning journey. Throughout the hymn  the two gods are urged to drive here to our sacrifice, with occasional mentions of the  sacrifices they should pass over on their way to ours (esp. vss. 13, 15). They are also  begged for the usual assortment of wealth in goods and livestock; their “refreshments”  (íṣ) are especially insistently hoped for (see vss. 5, 9, 10, 20, 21, 31, 34, 36). There is  almost no mythological material, little mention of the miraculous rescues that are  the Aśvins’ stock in trade. Brief allusions to two of these exploits are found in verses  22–23, and the bare names of a number of their clients are listed in verses 25–26.
The last three verses (37–39) are a dānastuti praising the gift of one Kaśu, lord  of the Cedis. His previous, fairly modest, gift is mentioned in verse 38, with the  hope that the Aśvins will have the opportunity to see a more magnificent version in  verse 37. And in verse 39 Kaśu is implicitly challenged to make an unparalleled gift,  so that other men will not win greater praise for their generosity.
