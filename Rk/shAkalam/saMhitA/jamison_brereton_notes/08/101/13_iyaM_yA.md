The referent of the fem. sgs. in this vs. is not entirely clear. Ge interprets it as the offering spoon or the butter offering, Old as the cow. I think Ge’s 2nd alternative is correct, with ā́huti- or a similar fem. noun as the word underlying.

Pāda b, “her form is created by a/the ruddy (cow),” because butter is a milk product.

(Ge supplies ‘flame’ rather than ‘cow’ with róhiṇyā, but róhiṇī- elsewhere refers to cows [see nearby VIII.93.13].) Pāda c is more or less VII.81.1a práty u adarśy āyatī́, and since the referent there is Dawn, the simile citréva (i.e., citrā́iva) must be comparing the bright butter offering (bright because it is whitish yellow or because it makes the fire brighter) to Dawn. As for the ten arms, Old and Ge both suggest that these are the arms of the five Adhvaryus. However, it seems possible to me that we’re dealing with body-part inflation, and the ten “arms” are the ten fingers (of a single priest) regularly referred to in ritual contexts.
