As in the previous hymn (VIII.97.9c, 10a), this one deploys two forms of the lexeme abhí √bhū ‘dominate’ to describe Indra - here 2a abhibhū́r asi and 5ab abhí … babhū́tha - although the two hymns are ascribed to different poets from different lineages.

As for the perfect form here, Kü (344-45) remarks that the perfect of √bhū, both as simplex and with abhí and pári, is generally presential in value, and such a value works well here. There is another issue with this perfect. This verse contains the 2nd sg. babhū́tha without i-liaison, but 11b has babhū́vitha with the liaison. It is striking to encounter both forms in the same hymn, esp. since, as Kü points out (344 n. 618), babhū́tha is the older, babhūvitha the younger form, found only once elsewhere in the RV, while babhū́tha is quite common. Metrics must have encouraged the use of younger babhū́vitha here, since it is final in a 12-syllable line, where the older form would not fit. The other babhū́vitha (VIII.33.19) occurs in an Anuṣṭubh cadence, where iambic rhythm is also favored. It is worth noting that thirteen of the twenty-one occurrences of babhū́tha are final in Triṣṭubh lines, so the insertion of the i-liaison simply converts this common cadential form into one appropriate to Jagatī.
