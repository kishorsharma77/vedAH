Although, as noted ad vs. 3, the word kaví- often signals a mention of Uśanā Kāvya -- and this personage figures in the myth being recounted here -- in the publ.

tr. I was tentatively inclined to follow Ge in taking kavím as a reference to Kutsa, since Kutsa could plausibly be qualified as nā́dhamāna- ‘in need’ in this myth and Uśanā Kāvya is unlikely to be. However, since the myth in question involves a trip to UK’s place to seek advice (see next vs., 10a), the phrase áchā kavím … gāḥ “you came to the kaví” in pāda a probably refers to UK, and the nā́dhamānam, found only at the end of b, may conceal a different goal, namely Kutsa. Hence I would emend the publ. tr. to “you came to the poet (=UK) (and) to the one in need (=Kutsa) at the winning of the sun.” In 11d kavíḥ also most likely refers to UK.

The phrase nṛmano … abhíṣṭau is reminiscent of 4d nṛ́tamo abhíṣtau.

The apparent thematic verbal stem iṣaṇa- is almost confined to this group of Indra hymns (in addition to this vs., IV.17.14, 22.10, 23.9, as well as a single outlier I.134.5, for which see comm. ad loc.). Narten’s interpr. of this stem as an aorist generated to the pres. iṣaṇyáti seems reasonable, though it does not account for the limited distribution of our stem: no forms of iṣaṇyá- are even found in the IVth Maṇḍala. (Narten, MSS 1982, cited after Kl. Schr., 266-67; cf. Gotō, 1st class, n.

243.) In its other two occurrences (I.129.7, VI.26.8) dyumnáhūti- ‘invocation to heavenly brilliance’ is a call that we sacrificers make to attract the god(s). I do not understand what it is expressing here. It does not seem to have anything to do with dyumnaíḥ in 19c below.
