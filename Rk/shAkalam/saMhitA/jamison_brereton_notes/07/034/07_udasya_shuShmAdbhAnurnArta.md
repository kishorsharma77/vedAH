Like vss. 3 and 4, this contains an unaccented oblique form of ayám, in this case asya, and as with those vss., I think it likely that asya is the sign of a riddling mention of a god -- in this case likely Agni, as Old tentatively suggests. Ge and Re also see a reference to the offering fire.

I do not understand the simile in the 2nd hemistich. If the bhū́ma that the earth bears is its surface, what would an equivalent burden be for the offering fire? In order to get 2 Dvipadā pādas in the 2nd hemistich, we must read *pṛthvī́for pṛthivī́, as Old points out. Otherwise we have a Triṣṭubh anticipating the switch to Triṣṭubh that happens much later in the hymn.
