Indra  
Puruhanman Āṅgirasa  
15 verses:  br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī arranged in pragāthas 1–6; br̥hatī arranged in trcas 7–12; u ̥ ṣṇih 13, anuṣṭubh 14, puraüṣṇih 15  
Another metrically complex hymn. The first six verses consist of three pragāthas in  br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, the next six (7–12) of two tr̥cas in br̥hatī, and the  last three (13–15) of verses in three different meters, but all consisting of eight syl lable or a mixture of eight and twelve syllable lines, like the br̥hatī/satobr̥hatī verses  before them.  
The thematic divisions correspond well with these metrical divisions. The  first six verses are extravagant praise of Indra’s unequalled power. Having flat tered him with his praise, the poet occupies the tr̥ca portion with the usual  requests for Indra to exercise his generosity and, more strikingly, for him to pun ish mortals who do not worship him and do not follow the Ārya way, with the culminating verse 11 listing the numerous ways in which this evil man can deviate  from the proper path. One of the stylistic features especially of the tr̥ca section  (but see also vs. 4) is the tendency for the final word or words of the c and d  pādas to match (4cd, 7cd, 8cd, 11cd, 12cd; see also 9a+d), and there are other  verse-internal echoes.  
The final three verses (13–15) are a dānastuti of Śara Śauradevya, or rather what  we might term an anti-dānastuti or, technically, a satire. The first of these verses (13)  poses a rhetorical question that seems to promise lavish praise to come, but the poet  takes this back in verse 14 with another rhetorical question: will you really receive  praise for a gift that consists of calves doled out in miserly fashion? The final verse  specifies just how miserly: a single calf for three poets. In these verses the standard  vocabulary of generosity (benefactor, patron, bounteous one) is deployed sarcasti  
cally, and the poet cleverly gives his criticism a gloss of praise.  
For an analysis of the phonetic and grammatical features of the entire hymn, see  Watkins (1995: 184–87).
