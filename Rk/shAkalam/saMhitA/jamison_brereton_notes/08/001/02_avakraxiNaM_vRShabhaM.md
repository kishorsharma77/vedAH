This verse, couched in the acc. sg. masc., is entirely dependent on the índram of 1c.

In b Ge (followed by, e.g., Scar 163) takes gā́m as a “(Kampf)stier” terrorizing the communities. Although it is of course sometimes necessary to interpret forms of gó- as masculine, the feminine “cow” predominates (esp. in contrast to the bull of 1c and 2a), and the Kampfstier seems to me an invention of contextual desperation. I interpret it instead as the first member of a decoupled compound *go-ṣáh (like go-jít-), parallel to carṣani- in carṣani-ṣáh-. A similar decoupling is found in the next pāda, and playing with analytic versus synthetic expressions is found elsewhere in the RV (see, e.g., VII.19.3-4, V.44.6, 52.15). A plural gā́s might have been desirable, but number is of course neutralized in 1st compound members, and when decoupled, the default might be the singular.

In the compound ubhayaṃkarám ‘making both’, the 1st compound member ubhaya- ‘both’ is further specified by two syntactically independent words vidvéṣaṇam and saṃvánanā - a play reminiscent of the one proposed for the preceding pāda. For the latter word, Old considers but seems to reject the possibility that it represents saṃvánanam with contraction of -a- with following u- over the -m.

It sees best to accept the text we have and interpret saṃvánanā as neut. pl., contrasting with the singular of vidvéṣaṇam. Perhaps Indra favors unions over divisions, and it would also be a clever reversal for ‘division’, which is inherently plural, to be presented in the singular, while ‘union’, which is inherently singular, is in the plural. It would also be possible to take saṃvánanā as an instr. singular of accompaniment: “division by hate along with union by love.”
