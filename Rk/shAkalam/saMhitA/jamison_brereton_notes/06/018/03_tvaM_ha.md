The sequence 2ND SG. PRN ha tyád (here ha nú tyád) is fairly common and appears to be strongly emphatic, hence my tr. “it was just you” (etc.). In several hymns (I.63.4-7, VIII.96.16-18) this construction is found in series. I take the fronted ásti followed by svid to be a strong existential “does it exist?” rather than simply the possessive constr. that Ge sees: “Hast du … diese Manneskrafte …?”
