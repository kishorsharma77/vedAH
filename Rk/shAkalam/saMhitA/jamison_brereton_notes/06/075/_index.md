Weapons Re EVP XVI (1976): 109-11 provides notes; it is tr. in the earlier Hymnes spéculatifs (1956) but without philological notes.

It is possible that this hymn was tacked onto the maṇḍala because of tigmā́yudhau tigmáhetī “possessing sharp weapons and sharp missiles” at the end of the preceding hymn (VI.74.3), though this is not a necessary hypothesis. The first 14 vss. are repeated in a number of places in the early Vedic ritual texts as part of the Aśvamedha (e.g., VS XXIX.38-51, TS IV.6.6).
