Ge takes ab as a direct quote (uttered by unidentified speakers). He presumably does this because of the difference in tense/mood (subjunctive vs. injunctive) and person (2nd vs. 3rd) between ab and cd. But since such switches are common in the RV, the direct speech does not seem necessary or contextually supported.
