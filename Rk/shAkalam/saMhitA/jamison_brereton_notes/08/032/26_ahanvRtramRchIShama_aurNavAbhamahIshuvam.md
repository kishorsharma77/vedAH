On ṛ́cīṣama- see I.61.1.

As in 2b ahīśúvam may be a PN, but I prefer to take it with lexical value. The same problem is encountered with aurṇavābhá-. Arbuda, however, is a known enemy of Indra, but this episode, with snow as the weapon, is otherwise unknown.

Note again the non-Indo-Āryan phonology.

The return of the theme of Indra’s smashing named enemies from vs. 2 suggests a ring, and the fact that the following verses (27-28) sketch a ring with vs. 1 strengthens this impression.
