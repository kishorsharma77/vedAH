The default referent of ásuraḥ pitā́naḥ “the lord, our father” here is of course Parjanya, since this is a Parjanya hymn and the subject is urged to pour out water (cf., e.g., Hale, Asura, 46-47). However, I wonder if this is not rather a reference to Dyaus Pitar, or at least an identification of Parjanya with Dyaus Pitar.

For Heaven as pitár- ásura-, see X.124.3 as well as disc. and other related passages in my “The Divine Revolution of RV X.124” (Ged. Staal, 2016), 294, and of course Zeus famously ‘rains’ in Greek.
