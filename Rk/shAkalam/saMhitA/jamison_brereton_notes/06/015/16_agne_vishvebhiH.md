The phrase “wooly womb” (ū́rṇāvantam yónim) is striking as a designation of Agni’s seat. Ge (n. 16b) thinks it refers to the barhis, but in fact the fire is not placed on that dry grass, which might produce a conflagration disruptive to the ritual.

I think it must rather refer to twigs and foliage still present on the firewood. In agreement with Ge (who is hesitant -- see n. 16c) and Re, I see a verseinternal enjambment: the two accusatives directly after the hemistich boundary, kulāyínaṃ ghṛtávantam, qualify yónim, which ends pāda b; then there is a syntactic break in the middle of the pāda, with dat. savitré construed with d, not c. This is unusual, but it is difficult to find a function for savitré in the preceding clause.
