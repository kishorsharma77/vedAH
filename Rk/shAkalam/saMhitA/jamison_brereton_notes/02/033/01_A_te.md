The only difficult pāda is c, which has received a variety of interpr. The first question is whether vīró árvati should be construed together or árvati taken with some other part of the clause. With Ge (/WG) I take the two words together in the publ. tr.; most other tr. (Macdonell, Re, Doniger, Maurer) take it with naḥ or directly with the verb abhí … kṣameta. Ge (/WG) take the hero to be one of us, a human; this leads Ge to interpr. the verb as passive (“Es möge unser Kriegsmann zu Ross verschont blieben”), although all forms of this idiom, med. abhí √kṣam, all of which appear in this little group of hymns (II.28.3, 29.2, 33.1, 33.7), have the same meaning, “be indulgent/patient towards” (see esp. vs. 7). With most tr. I instead understand vīrá- to be Rudra; it is appropriate to ask for his indulgence or patience.

This leads us to the question of whether Rudra is likely to be on horseback. I know of no evidence for or against, but given that Rudra is the Maruts’ father and they are often associated with horses, it is certainly possible. However, the only other occurrence of árvati in the RV (VIII.71.12) appears to be an unmarked loc. absolute: we ask Agni for help “when a charger (is at stake).” It is therefore possible that the same usage is found here, and the pāda should mean “The hero should be indulgent to us when a charger (is at stake).” I leave the question open.
