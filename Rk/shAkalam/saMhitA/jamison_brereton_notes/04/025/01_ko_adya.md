On the phraseology of c, see comm. ad IV.16.11. Though Ge (/WG) supply ‘day’ with pā́ryāya there seems no reason not to take it with the two immediately preceding datives.

Pāda d contains two functionally parallel expressions in two formally different guises: the loc. absol. sámiddhe agnaú “when his fire has been kindled” and the nom. bahuvrīhi sutásomaḥ “possessing pressed soma / he whose soma has been pressed.” A parallel bahuvrīhi to the first expression is also attested: iddhā́gni- (2x).
