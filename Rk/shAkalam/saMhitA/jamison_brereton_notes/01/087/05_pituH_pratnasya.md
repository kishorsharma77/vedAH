See the publ. intro. for discussion of the contents of this verse.

It may not be too farfetched to note, in connection with pāda d, where the Maruts acquire “their names worthy of worship” (nā́māni yajñíyāni), that in 1d they were explicitly unidentified and undifferentiated (ké cid “whoever they are”). The acquisition of these names follows their “reaching” (ā́śata) Indra, presumably to render him moral support in the Vṛtra battle with their chants (ṛ́k-) (pāda c). In other treatments of the aftermath of this battle they successfully negotiate with Indra for a share in the soma sacrifice (see I.165, etc.), and the expression “acquired names worthy of worship / sacrificial names” may be a way of expressing this incorporation of them into the dedicands of the soma sacrifice. Note that in VI.48.21 the Maruts assume Indra’s sacrificial name (dadhire nā́ma yajñíyam), also in connection with the Vṛtra battle.
