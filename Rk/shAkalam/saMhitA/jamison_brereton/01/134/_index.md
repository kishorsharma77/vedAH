Vāyu
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
6 verses: atyaṣṭi
As in most Vāyu hymns, the overriding focus here is on Vāyu’s journey to the early morning sacrifice and his right to drink first of the soma. The setting of the hymn  at dawn is conveyed by verses 3–4, and the priestly gifts that are distributed at this  morning ritual are alluded to in verses 1–3.
