Despite the position of prá, opening a pāda that ends with the part.

ukṣámāṇaḥ, I take the prá not with that participle but with immediately preceding pāda-final íyarti. For one thing, prá is found elsewhere with íyar- while it is not with √ukṣ, and in addition tmesis of preverb + participle is fairly uncommon (though certainly not unheard of). Ge and Re seem to follow the other route, taking it as license to interpr. íyarti as intrans. or at least objectless (Ge ‘heraufzieht’, Re ‘s’avance’). But íyar- is otherwise always transitive, and though we would prefer the two world halves not to be in motion, the point here is that Parjanya’s thunderstorm is powerful enough to shake them. WG’s interpr. is like mine.
