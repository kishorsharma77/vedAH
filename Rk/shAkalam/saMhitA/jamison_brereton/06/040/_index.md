Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is for the most part a typical invitation to Indra, to drive to our sacrifice  and drink the soma. However, it is chronologically backward. The first two verses  urge Indra to drink, the first opening with a peremptory command, “Indra, drink!”  The next two verses (3–4) command Indra to “drive here,” the logically prior action.  Only in the last verse do the two actions occur together, in the temporally appropri
ate order. The imperative “drink!” (píba) found as the second word in the hymn is  matched in the last pāda of the hymn by another imperative “take a drink” (pāhi),  likewise second in its pāda, both verbs formed to the same root but in the present  and aorist systems respectively.
Note also the reciprocal expressions in the final pādas of verses 1 and 4: in verse  1 it is Indra who will create vitality for the singer and the sacrifice; in verse 4 by  contrast the sacrifice creates vitality for Indra.
The final word of the hymn, “with the Maruts,” establishes the Midday Pressing  as the ritual in question. The Maruts are also obliquely referred to in the first verse,  in the phrase “amid your troop.”
