The man who lacks even a quiver lacks weapons and is therefore defenseless.

My interpr. of cd differs significantly from the standard (though it is close to Ge’s alternate, given at the end of his n. on 13cd). Most take yó rātáhavyaḥ as a nominal rel. cl. referring to the worshipper, with coreferential resumptive pronoun tám in the main clause vanóṣi tám, whose subject is Agni (e.g., Ge “Wer Opfer spendet … den begehrst du.”). (Its initial position in its clause would of course account for the accent on the main verb.) This interpretation has several merits: the skeletal syntactic structure is clear; it explains the unusual position of the tám; it parallels the structure of 14b; and rātáhavya- is more often used of mortals than of gods (a usage that might be supported here by the parallel compound práyatadakṣiṇa- in 15a). However, it makes the phrase kīréś cin mántram mánasā impossible to construe: the acc. sg. mántram has nothing governing it, and the “solution” in such tr. is simply to set it off by dashes and hope for the best. I therefore prefer to take cd as a single relative clause with Agni as subject. The adj.

rātáhavya- can modify gods, including Agni in IV.7.7. This reconfiguring of the syntax allows mántram to be the obj. of vanóṣi, with the point being that Agni, by properly performing his ritual duties, acquires a powerful mantra for the weakling in his charge. (The perhaps overly heavy tr. “mental spell” was meant to highlight the etymological relationship with mánas- ‘mind’.) My interpretation differs from the standard in other smaller ways. In c I take dhā́yase not as a quasi-infinitive to √dhā ‘place, establish’ (e.g., Ge “um sich Sicherheit zu schaffen”), a formation not otherwise found, but to the standard s-stem dhā́yas- ‘nourishment’ to √dhā(y) ‘nourish’. I also take kīréś cid with the preceding dative phrase, rather than with mántram.
