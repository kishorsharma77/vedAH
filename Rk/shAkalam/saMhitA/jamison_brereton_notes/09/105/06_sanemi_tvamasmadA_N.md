The two versions redistribute some of the lexical material, while keeping other parts constant. Both begin the verse with sánemi and end it with asmád ā́; only the two syllables in between differ. Both b pādas end káṃ cid atríṇam; 105 borrows ádevam from the c pāda of 104, while 104.6b begins rakṣásam, not found in 105. The ápa … dvayúm found at the beginning of 104.6c appears at the end of 105.6c. What precedes has no parallel in 104.6.

The sequence pári bā́dhaḥ was emended to paribā́dhaḥ, here as well as in VIII.45.40 (see comm. there) by BR, fld. by Gr and Old, with Ge skeptical but not entirely opposed (see his n. 6c). I suggest in both passages instead to assume a haplology of the impv. bādhasva in a putative sequence pári *bādhasva bā́dhaḥ, a suggestion made also by Re on our passage here, as it turns out. In our passage we must also assume the gapping of *yuyodhi with ápa, based on 104.6c ápa … dvayúm … yuyodhi.
