Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Like IV.13 this is a dawn hymn, and, as was noted there, it is closely paired with  that hymn. The chief divinities are the same, mentioned in more or less the same  order: Agni, Dawn, the Aśvins, Savitar, and the Sun; the final verses are identical;  and the first two verses are stylistic variants of each other. In verse 1 of both hymns  Agni looks toward the Dawns, and the Aśvins [/Nāsatyas] are urged to come to the  sacrifice; in verse 2 Savitar braces his beacon, and the Sun rises.
The other two verses (3–4) deviate somewhat. In IV.13 these were devoted to the  Sun, conveyed by seven mares, confronting darkness. Here verse 3 concerns Dawn  as the horse conveying the Sun: the equine theme of IV.13.3 is thus matched, but  with a different focus. In both hymns verse 4 also concerns driving, with horses that  are “the best conveyors” (váhiṣṭha), but in IV.13 it is the Sun who is being conveyed,  whereas in IV.14 it is the two Aśvins (unnamed).
These paired hymns give us valuable insight into the R̥gvedic poets’ composi tional techniques, showing how the poets could produce variety even from a tem plate of fairly specific themes (here vss. 1–2), and where the template allowed more  freedom in developing those themes (here vss. 3–4).
