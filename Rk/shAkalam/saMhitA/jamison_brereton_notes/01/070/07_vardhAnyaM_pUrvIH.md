The phrase pūrvī́ḥ kṣapó vírūpā(ḥ), lit. “many nights of differing form,” is convincingly taken by most commentators as an elliptical pl. for “… nights (and dawns)…,” since vírūpe regularly modifies the dual dvandva náktoṣā́sā ‘night and dawn’, including in Parāśara’s I.73.7. (See Old’s lucid presentation in SBE n.) Most tr. take it as the nom. pl. subject of várdhān, but, with Ge, I take it as an acc. pl.

expressing extent of time, supplying a pronominal subj. ‘they’, picking up “the races of gods and men” in the previous vs. Either interpr. is possible, and there is little to tip the balance one way or the other. Old argues that under the nominative interpr., which he favors, kṣapáḥ should probably be accented *kṣápaḥ (there are no other nom. pl. forms), and the need to account for the wrong accent (if such it is) and the fact that almost all occurrences of kṣapáḥ express extent of time (save for VIII.41.3, where it’s a direct obj.) might favor the acc. interpr.

With essentially all Western commentators starting with Benfey, I read carátham for the Pp. ca rátham, producing yet again Parāśara’s beloved, but morphologically troubled, merism “the still and the moving.” With most tr. I take it as neut. sg. and a second subject of várdhān (adjusted for number), though Ge interprets it as a gen. dependent on the “Keim” he supplies.

The ppl. právīta- always means ‘impregnated’ (of females) or, as here, ‘conceived’ (see Scar p. 501); WG’s “den vom Ṛta gesuchten” seemingly rests on the root etymology to √vī ‘pursue’, without taking into account the idiom.
