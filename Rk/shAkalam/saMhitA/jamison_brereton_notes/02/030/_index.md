Indra and other divinities This hymn has at least three, possibly four modern ling. features: conditional (ábhariṣyat vs. 2), future impv (kṛṇutāt vs. 5 [though the fut. impv. appears to be inherited, it is fairly rare in the RV and generally seems to belong to a more colloquial speech level]), gerund (abhikhyā́ya, hatvī́vss. 9, 10), and mid. subj. in -ai (naśāmahai vs. 11).
