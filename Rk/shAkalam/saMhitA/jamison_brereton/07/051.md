Ādityas
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is a general exhortation to the Ādityas to protect the sacrifice, keeping  its performance in “offenselessness” (adititvá), in accordance with their character as  sons of Aditi, the goddess who represents offenselessness or innocence. In the later  rite the offering of soma to Mitra and Varuṇa (as well as to the other dual divini
ties) takes place in the morning and that to the Ādityas (as well as to other divine  collectives) in the evening. The gods in the last verse are worshiped at various times  in the sacrificial day, but there appears to be an emphasis on gods associated with  the evening rite: the Ādityas, All Gods, R̥bhus, and even the Aśvins, who are con
nected with both the morning and the evening rituals.
## 1
We would be accompanied by the present help of the Ādityas and by  their most luck-bringing protection. Let the overpowering ones establish this sacrifice in guiltlessness and in  offenselessness (adititvá), listening (to us).
## 2
Let the Ādityas and Aditi find exhilaration, let Mitra, Aryaman, and  Varuṇa, who are the most straightforward.
Let the herdsmen of the living world be ours. Let them drink the soma  to help us today.
## 3
All the Ādityas, and all the Maruts, and the All Gods, and all the R̥bhus, Indra, Agni, and the two Aśvins, (all) being praised. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.
