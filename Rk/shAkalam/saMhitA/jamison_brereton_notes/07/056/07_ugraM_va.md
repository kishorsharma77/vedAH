The first pāda of this vs., ugráṃ va ójaḥ, restates the last pāda of the preceding vs. (6d ójobhir ugrā́ḥ) as an equational nominal clause. Because of its connection with vs. 6 it also sets up the expectation that what follows will also be an etymological figure, but b sthirā́śávāṃsi is not, though it has the same syntactic configuration as pāda a.

The loose construction of the instr. marúdbhiḥ is similar to that in 5a.
