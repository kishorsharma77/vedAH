At the match to win the sun, at the speech of the Propitiator, at the  very anointing of the one who wakes at dawn [=Agni]—at the very
anointing of the one being prepared [=soma]—
on (that) day Indra is to be invoked by every head [=person], in the way  that is known.
Toward us only let your gifts be directed—the auspicious gifts of the  auspicious one.
