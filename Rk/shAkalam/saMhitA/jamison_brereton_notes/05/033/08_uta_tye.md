It is unclear whether the horses in ab and those in c are the same or different.

In the publ. tr. they are treated as the same; the standard tr. take them as separate groups. The two occurrences of mā (a, c) may support the standard view, in which case vahantu needs to be supplied in the first hemistich (so Ge, etc.). I take saśce in pass. sense: “I am followed/accompanied.” Ge (/WG, also Klein I.425) take it to mean “be in agreement with,” but I do not know of other occurrences of √sac with this meaning. (Ge’s overelaborate set of explanatory glosses in n. 8d and n. 2 to that n. may attest to his discomfort with it.) The ‘intentions” by which I am attended are G’s intentions to give; see the expansion on krátu- in 9b. I think the point is not that the poet thinks it’s a good idea for G. to give horses to him (that is, agrees with G), but that G’s intentions to give are the poet’s escorts, as it were. (One is reminded of the curious beings known as rātiṣā́c- ‘Giftescort’.) Indeed these “intentions” may be the actual horses given; see 9b where the “bounties” produced by such intention are also actualized as horses.
