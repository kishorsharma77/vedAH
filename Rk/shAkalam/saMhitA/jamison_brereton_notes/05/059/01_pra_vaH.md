As was indicated in the publ. intro., the referent of the ‘spy’ (spáṭ) is unclear.

Ge suggests a number of possibilities, none compelling; WG take it as the singer. Most bizarrely, Old interprets the word as an interjection. I think it possible that it is the sun. One clue is the repetition of the phrase suvitā́ya dāváne “to give good faring,” which is used of the Maruts in 4d. I therefore think the ‘spy’ must be a being that can function in the same way as the Maruts and provide the same type of benefit. The sun is elsewhere called a spy (X.35.8), provides light for creatures to move about, and appears before and, more importantly, after a storm.

Part of the solution to the foregoing question depends on another problem in the first pāda, the interpr. of the 3rd sg. verb (prá …) akran. It is regularly assigned to √krand ‘roar’ (so, e.g., Gr, Lub), and the standard tr. all interpr. it so. But this interpr.

is by no means universal: both Wh (Rts) and Macdonell instead assign it to √kram ‘stride’. (Old, again bizarrely, takes it to √kṛ.) Narten sides with the √krand contingent (Sig. Aor. 99 n. 254), though without argument, simply asserting “… kann nicht … zum Wz.-Aor. von kram gestellt werden.” On the one hand, of course, the argument against √kram is obvious: it is a seṭ root -- its 3rd sg. root aor. should be, and in fact is, ákramīt. But there are countervailing arguments. √krand is found with the preverb prá in the RV only in IX.77.1 and, at least acdg. to MonWms., nowhere else in Skt., whereas prá √kram is common. Vs. 4d, containing the other occurrence of suvitā́ya dāváne, also contains a verb of movement (at least acdg. to me and Ge), prá bharadhve ‘press forward’; moreover, suvitā́ya elsewhere in the RV regularly appears with verbs of motion (cf., e.g., nearby V.57.1 suvitā́ya gantana), whereas it does not fit easily with verbs of proclaiming (though cf. VIII.27.10 prá ṇaḥ pū́rvasmai suvitā́ya vocata). As for the morphological problem, from the fairly common (9x) 3rd pl. root aor. (á)kramuḥ, an aniṭ-type kran could easily be backformed. If the verb does belong with √kram and the spy therefore strides forth, rather than roars forth, an entity like the sun makes good sense.

The pāda-initial árcā exactly matches pāda-init. árcā in the opening vs. of the opening hymn in the Marut cycle, V.52.1. As there, so here, we can read the preverb prá with that verb, borrowing it either from the vs. initial form or from the third word in the 2nd pāda. In fact this 2nd prá can be read as a preverb in tmesis either with árcā or with final bhare (or both), and in the former case, it could be interpr. as having moved to the end of its clause árcā divé prá right before the caesura with an opening of 5, rather than being the first word of the 2nd clause prá pṛthivyā́ṛtám bhare right after the caesura with an opening of 4. In other words, prá is ambiguously positioned both syntactically and metrically.

Another ambiguous form is táruṣanta (in sandhi) in c, which can be resolved either as finite 3rd pl. med. táruṣante (so Pp, Gr, etc.) or an act. pres. part. masc. pl.

táruṣantaḥ. In the first instance it owes its accent to its clause-init. position; in the latter, because it’s a participle. Since this stem has exactly 3 forms in all of Skt. -- this one, an active taruṣema, and a med. 3rd pl. (-anta replacement?) taruṣanta, there is no way to tell, though, since taruṣanta could also belong to an underlyingly active stem, I’m somewhat inclined towards the act. part.
