The fronted ásti in the previous vs. is matched by equally emphatic, fronted sád íd. Although Ge takes sát as the modifier of the sáhaḥ that begins the next pāda, I think instead that it answers the question posed in 3cd and therefore implicitly modifies vīryàm in 3c. This is then further specified as sáhaḥ beginning in b, which then is qualified by the adjectives ugrám and távīyaḥ in c.

The last three pādas of the vs. are a veritable riot of etymological figures, with two each in b and c and one in d: b sáhaḥ sahiṣṭha turatás turásya, c ugrám ugrásya tavásas távīyaḥ, d áradhrasya radhratúraḥ … The 2nd member of this last cmpd, -tur-, belongs etymologically with the 2nd figure of b, turatás turásya, though unfortunately since it’s used in a somewhat different sense, this connection cannot easily be conveyed in translation. Similarly, the 2nd figure of c, tavásas távīyaḥ, picks up the tuvi- of the cmpd in a, tuvi-jātá-. So, in addition to the juxtaposed linear figures, there is some interweaving across pāda boundaries.
