Soma Pavamāna
Priyamedha Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Attributed to another Āṅgirasa, whose given name is similar to the poet of the last  hymn (IX.27), this follows the same pattern, with initial “he, that one” (eṣá) opening  every verse. Otherwise it is constructed of the usual clichés, though the rhetoric is  nicely balanced.
