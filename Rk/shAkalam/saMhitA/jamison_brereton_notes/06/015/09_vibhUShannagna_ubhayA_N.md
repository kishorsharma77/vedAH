The publ. tr. fails to tr. dūtó devā́nām. The tr. should be emended to “… as messenger of the gods, you speed …” The lexeme ví √bhūṣ occurs only here and I.112.4 until Epic, and it is not entirely clear what it means here. “Seeking manifestation” of the publ. tr. depends on the usage of rare ví √bhū, which can mean ‘become manifest’; an example is found (at least by my lights) in vs. 14. But it might have the less marked meaning ‘becoming conspicuous, distinguished’ or ‘becoming extended/extensive’. In any case it picks up vibhúm, which opens the last pāda of the preceding vs. Note also the polarized preverbs ví and sám at opposite ends of the hemistich.

The Pp. takes ubháyām̐as acc. pl. masc. ubháyān (so also Gr), but as Old suggests (ZDMG 55.313, Noten), it could be neut. pl. ubháyā with nasalization in hiatus, and a neut. pl. construed with vratā́is an attractive choice here. The phrase ubháyā(m) ̐ ánu vratā́“following both (kinds of) commandments” would of course refer to those of gods and men, who were mentioned in 8c.
