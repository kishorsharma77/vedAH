This verse concerns the three forms of Agni, with “form” expressed by neut.

vápuḥ in a, which should be supplied with dvitī́yam in b and tṛtī́yam in c. (Contra Ge [/WG], who take vápuḥ as an adjective and the ordinals as adverbs. Since vápuṣe is clearly nominal in 1a, an adjectival usage in the following vs. would be surprising, esp. as there are, in my opinion, no certain exx. of adjectival vápus-.) In a I take pṛkṣáḥ as the gen. sg. of pṛ́kṣ-, rather than the nom. sg. of pṛkṣá- (so Gr, Old [SBE], Ge, WG) or acc. pl. of pṛ́kṣ- (so Re). It is a descriptive or qualifying gen.: the “wondrous form of nourishment.” It is not entirely clear what this phrase refers to, but I would suggest that it is the plants, which are often said to contain the fire in embryonic form (thus wondrously). In this form he is “abounding in food” both because the plants feed the fire and because plants supply nourishment to the living world. Such a qualifying gen. is also found in vṛṣabhásya in c acdg. to my interpr. (but not those of others). The root noun pṛ́kṣ- is probably found also in pṛkṣúdh- in vs. 4 below, qualifying plants (vīrúdhaḥ), which supports my interpr.

here.

The second wondrous form is the fire in the waters, which has come to be identified with Apām Napāt. The “sevenfold-kindly (saptáśivāsu) mothers” must be the seven streams. The compound is oddly formed, and Gr, inter alia, suggests reading *saptá *śivā́su, an unnecessary emendation, particularly if we maintain the compound reading of dáśapramatim in d (see immed. below).

The third form of fire, presented in cd, appears to be the ritual fire produced by the kindling sticks wielded by the fingers, which are characterized, as so often, as “young women” (yóṣaṇaḥ). The cmpd. dáśapramatim ‘having ten(fold) forethought’ suffers from the same formational oddity as saptáśivāsu and has been even more eagerly emended to *dáśa *prámatim (see, e.g., Old, Noten, who keeps saptáśivāsu as a cmpd but supports emending the other to two words). The dáśa, liberated from the compound, would qualify the fingers, as often. However, in my opinion we must keep either both compounds or neither, and since the cmpds are the more difficult readings and Dīrghatamas is a tricky poet, I see no reason to emend.

Note that janayanta in b rhymes with anayanta in 1d in the same metrical position.
