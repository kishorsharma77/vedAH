A small grammatical mismatch here: the phrase viśve devā́saḥ and the adjectives modifying it (aptúraḥ, tū́rṇayaḥ) are nominatives and should not be the subject of the imperative ā́ganta. Ge. (and WG) ignore the problem by translating the nom. as voc. (“Ihr Allgötter”). Although the effect is minor, my translation reflects the grammatical disjunction by rendering pāda b as an interjection.

Another question is why 7b contains the same 2nd pl. imperative, except with a different grade of the root: ā́gata vs. ā́ganta. Both forms are reasonably well attested, with 7b a repeated pāda (=II.41.13a, VI.52.7a). Whatever the history of the distinction, the synchronic distribution seems to be metrical, with ā́gata almost always final, providing an iambic cadence in dimeter verse, and ā́ganta found earlier in the verse.

In b tū́rṇayaḥ was carelessly omitted from the tr., which should read “Come here swiftly…”
