As noted in the intro., ródasī is a pun. In pāda a it refers to the two worldhalves, but in cd the unexpressed subject is feminine and mounts the Maruts’ chariot. This can only be Rodasī, the Maruts’ consort (for mounting their chariot, see I.167.5-6), who ordinarily is accented rodasī́but here must be generated by otherwise homonymous ródasī in pāda a.

áhimanyavaḥ should probably be unaccented, in a voc. phrase with śūrāḥ, but since the phrase śávasā́himanyavaḥ is exactly repeated from the preceding vs., 8d, where it is properly nom., it could hardly have failed to acquire an accent redactionally.
