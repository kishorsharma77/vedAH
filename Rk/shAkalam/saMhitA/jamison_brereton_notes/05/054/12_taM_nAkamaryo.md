Note the repetition of ágṛbhīta-śociṣ- from 5c; this cmpd is found only once elsewhere in the RV (VIII.23.1, of Agni).

The first hemistich is discussed in some detail by Thieme (Fremd. 68-70), whose interpr. I basically follow. I would add that the (heavenly) brilliance that cannot be grasped by the Ārya on earth is shaken down as rain by the Maruts.

There are two basic interpr. of c, depending on what the subject of sám acyanta is taken to be. For Ge the subj. is the Maruts, with vṛjánā the grammatical obj. referring to their girthbands: they are girding themselves for battle. WG’s interpr. also takes the reference to be to the Maruts, but with vṛjánā as the subj. referring to the closing of the ranks (Reihe) of the Maruts, again before some warlike manoeuvre on their part. In both these interpr. the referent of the subj. of sám acyanta and átitviṣanta is the same: the Maruts. With Re I instead consider the verbs to have different subjects: the subj. of sám acyanta, vṛjánā, refers to the circles or communities of the Ārya, while the Maruts are the subj. of átitviṣanta. I think the two hemistichs contrast the Maruts’ effects on the Ārya communities: in ab the Maruts bring them the welcome rain they cannot get themselves, but in cd they cling together during the violence of the Maruts’ storm. (I cannot decide which strain Kü’s tr. (224) follows, though WG’s paraphrase of it in their n. leans towards the Re/JB side.)
