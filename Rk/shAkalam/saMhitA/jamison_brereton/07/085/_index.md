Indra and Varuṇa  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The poet announces his hymn in the first verse, implicitly comparing it to Agni,  the sacrificial fire. Agni has a “face of ghee,” that is, he is both bright like ghee and  receives oblations of ghee (cf. I.143.7, III.1.18, V.11.1, X.21.7). This prepares for  verse 4, in which the poet asks that Agni be the Hotar of this rite, who will bring  the oblations to Indra and Varuṇa. The last verse is also found as VII.84.5 but is less  thematically connected to this hymn than it is to the previous hymn.
