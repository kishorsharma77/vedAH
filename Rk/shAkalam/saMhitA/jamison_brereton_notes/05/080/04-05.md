4b and 5d are entirely parallel in structure: 4b utá mitró bhavasi deva dhármabhiḥ 5d utá pūṣā́bhavasi deva yā́mabhiḥ This strict parallelism should extend to the two final instr. pls. -- that is, Savitar should become the god in question by virtue of a quality/entity held in common and expressed in the instr. I therefore think it unlikely that dhármabhiḥ is the vague “nach deinen Eigenschaften” of Ge or “par (tes) dispositions-naturelles” of Re; it needs to refer to an actual thing, like Pūṣan’s journeys. In the publ. tr. I render it as ‘supports’ (sim. WG “durch deine Unterstützungen”), keeping in mind that Savitar often holds up his arms, which may function as literal supports. But it may rather be something like ‘institutes, ordinances’, referring to the regulation of time and activity that Savitar performs.
