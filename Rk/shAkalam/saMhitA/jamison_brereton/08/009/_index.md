Aśvins
Śaśakarṇa Kāṇva
21 verses: br̥hatī 1, 4, 6, 14, 15; gāyatrī 2, 3, 20, 21; kakubh 5; anuṣṭubh 7–9, 13, 16–19;  triṣṭubh 10; virāj 11; jagatī 12, all arranged in trcas ̥
As is clear from the display above, a dizzying variety of meters is found in this  hymn. However, as Oldenberg points out (1888: 151), save for the tr̥ca composed of  verses 10–12, all these differently named meters are composed of combinations of  eight- and twelve-syllable pādas, which combine easily and without confusion, and  several tr̥cas consist of a single meter (anuṣṭubh vss. 7–9, 16–18).
As in the previous hymn, the poet identifies himself several times as Vatsa  (vss. 1, 6, 15); the Anukramaṇī’s ascription to Śaśakarṇa (“Hare-eared”) may be  taken as a nickname or simply a fanciful invention, as it has no verbal support  in the hymn.
The contents of the hymn are both as various as its meters and, underlyingly,  as harmonious. Certain expressions recur throughout the hymn (half-verse initial ā́ nūnám “here and now,” alternating with simple ā́ “here”; repeated yád and yád vā “when”/“or when”; repeated prá). The poet focuses on asking the Aśvins for aid  and protection, and offers sacrificial service in return. A tr̥ca late in the hymn (vss.  16–18) is addressed to Dawn in her relation to the Aśvins, a connection that fixes  the ritual time of at least that part of the hymn as the Morning Pressing.
