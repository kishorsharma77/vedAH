By my interpr. (as well as the standard ones), this vs. contains two forms of the act. pres. stem céta-, 3rd sg. cetat (or acetat: see immed. below) in pāda a and part.

cétantī in c. The first is found in the sequence ékācetat, analyzed by the Pp. as ékā acetat. This is perfectly possible, but an injunctive form is equally possible on textual grounds and in my opinion would fit the presential/resultative context better. See Gotō (1st cl., 138 and n. 181), who so interprets it. In any case, I take it as intransitive ‘shows / appears’, with ś́úciḥ as the predicate adjective. In c the participle cétantī has 120 the sense ‘perceives, takes note’ and governs the gen. rāyáḥ. Given the semantic multivalence of the root √cit and the pleasure poets take in manipulating and juxtaposing its forms, this functional shift within a verse is not surprising. (Gotō [p.

138] also assigns different functions to the two forms.) The intrans. use of cetat is supported by cetati in the same usage in the next hymn (VII.96.3).
