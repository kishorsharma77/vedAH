Ge also (n. 8c) claims (fld. by Re) that this vs. is entirely Varuṇa’s. This is more plausible: he is mentioned by name in b, and máhivrataḥ ‘having great commandments’in c makes it likely that the clause in cd has Varuṇa as subject — though note that máhivrata- is used of Varuṇa only here, with two occurrences each of Agni and Soma, and moreover dhṛtavratā is addressed to both gods in the next vs. (10b). Nonetheless, samrā́j- in pāda a is used frequently of Indra as well as of Varuṇa, so the 1st hemistich may (and probably does) contain a exhortation to the poet to chant both to Indra (as sovereign king) and Varuṇa. The publ. tr. could make this clearer if ‘and’ replaced the comma: “to the lofty sovereign king (and) to the god Varuṇa”
