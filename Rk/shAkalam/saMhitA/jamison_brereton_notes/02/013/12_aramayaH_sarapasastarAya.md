The use of the secondarily shortened stem śraváya- here instead of inherited śrāváya- may have been favored by the similarly short-root-vowel áramayaḥ at the beginning of this vs. (which stem comes by its short root vowel honestly) and by the denom. śravasyá- in the next vs. More problematic is what prá … śraváyan is conveying here. One might think that what the blind and the lame want is not fame but healing. Some such consideration must have led Gr to assign this form (and prā́śrāvayam X.49.8) to a different root śru and a different idiom prá √śru ‘vorwärts bringen’. I see no justification for such a separation. It is possible that the causative here means (as it can elsewhere) ‘make hear/heed’ rather than ‘make heard/famed’, though this wouldn’t appreciably improve the situation of the blind and lame. Or that in the idiom prá √śru, the prá came to dominate, with a sense ‘further, favor (through fame)’.
