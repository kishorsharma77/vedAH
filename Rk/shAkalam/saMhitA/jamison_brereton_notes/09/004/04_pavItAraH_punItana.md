This vs. stands apart from the rest of the hymn, which is otherwise addressed in the 2nd ps. to Soma. Here we have a ref. to the (human) ritual participants (pávītāraḥ ‘purifiers’), and though soma appears in the vs., it is as the substance not the god, and in the 3rd ps.

On pávītāraḥ see comm. ad IX.83.2. Note in passing that this is a voc. with retracted accent; the form given by Gr for this passage, -ā́ras, is incorrect.
