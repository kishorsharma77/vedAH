I consider this verse the Maruts’ insulted response to Indra’s insults, couched in a very slangy register. The first sign of this speech level is the voc. are (to arí- ‘stranger’), a vocative not otherwise found in the RV, but remember the Pāli and Pkt. “interjections” are, ale, clearly derived from this voc. (Thieme, Fremdl. 3-4), as well as the famous shibboleth he ‘lavo of ŚB III.2.1.23, consisting of an l-form of the plural voc. of this word in MIA guise (see EWA, KEWA s.v.). Its use as a shibboleth and with an l-form suggests popular speech.

Note also the lengthened voc. vṛṣabhā (also in 22a). Lengthened vocatives are quite rare in the RV; AiG III.96-97 cites only these two forms, but remarks that pluti vocatives were surely a feature of living speech, found in the Brāhmaṇas and in Pāli and the Prākrits. The use of the well-known gambling term svaghnī́also marks the speech as low register. The substance of the Maruts’ counter-accusations is that Indra greedily drank up the soma offered to him below (that is, among men). I’ve used the expression “lower depths” to refer to the louche aspects of a gambling place (and also possibly to the depression in the ground where the dicing happens). Indra carried on arrogantly and without sharing the soma, but then, they say, when he got into a jam in the Vrtra ̥ battle he suddenly remembered he had pals and upbraided them for desertion.
