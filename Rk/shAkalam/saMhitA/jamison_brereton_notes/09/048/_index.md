As noted in the publ. intro., vss. 3-4 concern the stealing of Soma from heaven (“Somaraub”), a story not otherwise characteristic of IX but treated in detail in IV.26-27. I now think it possible that vss. 1-2 also allude to the same myth, though very obliquely.

Details in the comm. to the relevant vss. Our poet, Kavi Bhārgava, also treats this myth in IX.77, one of his Jagatī hymns.
