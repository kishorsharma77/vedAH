Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
15 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
The hymn comprises five tr̥cas, at least some of which show formal linkages that  connect a tr̥ca to the one following it. This is particularly obvious in the case  of the third (vss. 7–9) and fourth (vss. 10–12) tr̥cas, which are connected to the  fourth and fifth (vss. 13–15) respectively. The last verse of the third tr̥ca (9a,  c) describes Agni as váreṇyaḥ. . . dákṣasya pitáram “(the one) to be chosen, the  father of skill,” a characterization echoed by váreṇyaṃ dákṣasya in 10ab, the first  verse of the fourth tr̥ca. Likewise, the poet “summons” (īḷe) Agni at the end of  verse 12 and then describes him as īḷénya “to be summoned” in verse 13. A ring  formed by havíṣmant “bearing offerings” in the first and penultimate verses pro vides a unity to the whole hymn.

Even though this hymn is closely connected to the ritual, the precise application  of the verses is not clear. Bergaigne thinks that they are sāmidhenī (fire-kindling)  verses to be recited as the fire is kindled, and surely this is true of at least the last  tr̥ca, which repeats the verb sam √idh in each of its verses. Oldenberg agrees that  parts of this hymn are sāmidhenī verses, but suggests that verses 7–9, for example,  describe the agnipraṇayana, the procession of the fire to the uttaravedi in the classi
cal Vedic rite, and that 10–12 refer to the installation of the fire. The agnipraṇayana  and the deposition of the fire are closely conjoined rites.
