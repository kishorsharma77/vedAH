ā́paḥ in b can certainly be the old nominative plural used as an accusative, as occasionally happens in late RV (so Gr and implicitly most tr.), but as I suggested elsewhere (1982: 260), it may be the nominative plural it appears to be; this may be an example of case disharmony in a simile, exploiting the ambiguities in syntax of the verb √pi ‘swell’ that the poets were always happy to capitalize on. In the frame pīpayaḥ is transitive (“you swell the refreshment”), but in the simile intransitive (“as waters [swell]”).

I take tmánam as functioning as a reflexive pronoun (“extend yourself”), while most tr. take it as a noun (Ge ‘Lebensgeist’, WG ‘Lebenshauch’). This is the only acc. to the truncated stem tmán-, and so its usage is hard to determine. The oblique cases (dominated by inst. tmánā) generally refer to the self (‘by yourself, for ourselves’, etc.), without a full-blown nominal sense, which accounts for my tr.

However, the active form of yáṃsi gives my pause, and so the standard tr. should be considered (though I am not ready to adopt it). “Extend nourishment to us” seems to be formulaic, with an active form of √yam, and so that voice may have prevailed here, despite the reflexive tmánam; cf. III.1.22 prá yaṃsi … íṣo nah, IV.32.7 sá no yandhi … íṣam.
