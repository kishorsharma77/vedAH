On the “three voices” (tisró vā́caḥ) see comm. ad IX.33.4, 50.2.

The parallel expressions in c and d -- … yanti … PTCLE contrast the progress of ritual substance (milk) and ritual speech (thoughts). As elsewhere, vāvaśānā́ḥ could belong to both √vāś ‘bellow’ and √vaś ‘desire, be eager’ (cf. IX.93.4, 95.4).

Given the emphasis on noise in this tṛca, the former is probably primary, but both can be meant - hence my tr. “bellowing eagerly.”
