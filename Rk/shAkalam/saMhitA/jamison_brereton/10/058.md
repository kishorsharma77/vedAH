The Return of Mind (Manaāvartaṇam)
The four Gaupāyanas or Laupāyanas (as for X.57)
12 verses: anuṣṭubh
This hymn is a continuation of X.57, the spell to bring the return of “mind” to  a dead or dying person. But the monotonous patterned repetition in this piece contrasts with the varied ways in which X.57 seeks the return of mind. In fact, we  might consider this the performative verbal material, the incantation itself, referred  to in X.57.3 “we now call mind hither.”
The structure is simple: each verse envisions a distant location where mind may  have gone, and calls for it to return from that place. The first verse is perhaps the  most crucial, for Yama is the ruler of the dead, and if mind has gone there, the  person in question has presumably died. Yama’s realm is also probably alluded to  in the middle verse (6): the first verse of the Yama hymn, the first funeral hymn  (X.14.1), refers to Yama as the one “who has departed along the great slopes,”  using the same word, pravát, as here. The other destinations are generally features  of heaven or of earth; the range seems like an elaborated version of the disposi tion of the body and its parts in the funeral verse X.16.3 “Let your eye go to the  sun, your life-breath to the wind. Go to heaven and to earth as is fitting. Or go to  the waters, if it has been fixed for you there. Take your stand in the plants with  your limbs,” and it is also reminiscent of similar dispositions of the body in the  Upaniṣads.
