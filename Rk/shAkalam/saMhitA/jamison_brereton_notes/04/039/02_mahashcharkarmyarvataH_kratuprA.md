I take kratu-prā́- as referring to the poet’s own krátu- ‘intention, conception’

-- that is, producing the praise-hymn he has envisioned. So also Re and (partly) WG.

Others consider it the krátu- of others or of all, and Old suggests an emendation to

*kratupráḥ (gen.) because he thinks it more applicable to Dadhikrā than the poet.

This cmpd seems to play off kṛṣṭi-prā́- in the last hymn (IV.38.9b) in structure and phonology, but since it is found once elsewhere, as is the derivative kratu-prā́van-, both in the same hymn (X.100.12 and 11 respectively), it was not simply created here for the occasion on that model. That both words in X.100 refer to a poet/singer as here undercuts Old’s justification for his emendation.

Maurer (324-25) renders puruvā́ra- as ‘richly tailed’ (vā́ra- ‘tail-hair’ beside vā́ra- ‘favor, choice thing’), an interpr. also given by Scar (332) as an alternative (‘mit den buschigen Schwanzhaaren’). I find this appealing (as a pun, not as the primary reading) -- but ultimately unlikely: unlike the other hymns in this sequence, no other physical attributes or characteristics of Dadhikrā, save his swiftness, are described in this hymn.

In the 2nd hemistich pūrúbhyaḥ … táturim was mistakenly tr. twice in the publ tr. Eliminate the last phrase “as one triumphant for the Pūrus.”
