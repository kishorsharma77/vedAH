I take góbhiḥ twice, with both the frame and the simile. In the frame it is to be construed with tám … śrīṇántaḥ “preparing it with cows’ milk,” but in the simile yávaṃ ná “like barley” I take it as a passive variant of the common figure “as cows enjoy a grainfield (yávasa-),” e.g., V.53.8 ráṇan gā́vo ná yávase.

In c Ge supplies “lade ich,” but I read akarma from b also in this pāda, in a different idiom “make X to be at/in.” The usual idiom is ā́√kṛ ‘bring here’; unfortunately there is no trace of ā́.
