Indra  
Aṣṭaka Vaiśvāmitra  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
The poet of this hymn is identified as a descendant of Viśvāmitra, and the hymn  ends (vs. 11) with the Viśvāmitra refrain found in most of the Indra hymns of the  IIIrd Maṇḍala (III.31.22, etc.). Like X.89, another Indra hymn of the Xth Maṇḍala  ascribed to a Vaiśvāmitra and ending with the same refrain, this hymn seems like  a self-consciously old-fashioned composition, falling squarely into the genre of  “journey” hymn, in which Indra is invited to come with his horses to the soma  
pressing. That praise poetry is at least equally important as soma at the sacrifice is  made abundantly clear throughout the hymn. Toward the end (starting with vs. 8),  the hymn turns to the topic of the Vr̥tra myth and, especially, Indra’s freeing of the  waters after his defeat of Vr̥tra.
