The placement of the simile marker ná seems to make náktoṣā́sā ‘Night and Dawn’ part of the simile itself, rather than the frame, but, esp. given the rigid structure of Āprī hymns, where the pair Night and Dawn is one of the key words, this is not possible. We must just assume that the tendency to put ná after the first word of the phrase has taken over here.
