This vs. expresses the poet’s willingness to let Indra supersede the Maruts if he provides sufficient wealth. The Maruts used to be the leaders, but now leadership passes to Indra, by indirection: the poet ascribes the leadership to his riches. (The cynical might think this ascription is not merely metaphorical.) As Ge points out, the poet is essentially apologizing to the Maruts and hoping (pāda c) that they will excuse his defection.

The iva in d is unusual in occurring after the verb gātuyánti. Ge tr. it more or less as I do. Re seems to ignore it, as do WG (unless this is what their “just” in “die … just den Weg wiesen,” though “just” [precisely] would seem to convey a sense opposite to the approximative iva). It might be possible to consider iva displaced to the left as sometimes, to be read with devā́ḥ (“like gods”), but this seems unlikely, given that the Maruts are gods.
