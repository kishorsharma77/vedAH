Praise of Indra’s Horses  
Baru Āṅgirasa or Sarvahari Aindra  
13 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 12–13  
Like III.44 the design of this hymn is an extended pun between the words  hári/hárita “gold-colored, tawny” (used regularly for soma and for Indra’s “fallow  bay” horses) and the verb hárya “enjoy” and its derivatives. As in III.44 we have  rendered the former as “golden,” even in reference to the horses, and the latter as  “gladden(ing),” as a close English equivalent of this play on words. A subsidiary  pun is persistent through the hymn, involving the golden mace and the golden soma  (see, e.g., vs. 3); the referent of the adjective is often not expressed, and the audience  is free to fill in either or both. The context often allows either, and since they are  identical in gender, there is no grammatical obstacle. Similar ambiguity is found  between the golden horses and the golden soma (e.g., vs. 10). In other verbal twists  the “wrong” qualifier is used, but the underlying pun evokes the “right” one. Thus  in verse 4 the “gladdening” mace is compared to the sun, which should really be  “golden.”
