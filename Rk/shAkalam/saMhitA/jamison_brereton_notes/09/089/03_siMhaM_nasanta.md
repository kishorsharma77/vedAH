Gr, Ge, and Old (flg. Lanman, Noun Inflec. 414) take mádhvaḥ as a nom. pl.

Lanman and Gr (supplying drapsā́s or sim.) identify it as masc. (Old says nothing further), while Ge seemingly as a fem., since he supplies “Milchkühe.” This gender switch (and adjectival interpr.) is unnec.; in all cases of supposed masc. or fem. pl.

mádhvaḥ (see the list in Gr) the form can be interpr. as a gen. sg. to the neut. noun. In our passage Re supplies a pl. subj. “streams” on which gen. mádhvaḥ depends: “(Les coulées) de miel …” But I simply take it as a gen. of material, dependent on siṃhám (“lion of honey”). The cmpd. mádhu-pṛṣṭha- ‘honey-backed’, lit. ‘having a back of honey’ (in my interpr., contra Gr/Ge ‘having honey on his back’) supports my interpr., and note that 6d contains a mádhvaḥ that is universally taken as gen. As subj. of nasanta I supply cows or waters, probably the former, since they appear in c and implicitly in d.

Ge seems to take ayā́sam with pátim rather than siṃhám, but given that the adj. appears in the same pāda with the lion and given that another animal, the horse, is described as ayā́sam in the next vs. (4a), “unbridled lion” seems more likely.
