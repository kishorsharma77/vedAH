I take pári yanti in two different senses, one with each pāda of the hemistich: in c the verb describes the literal circuit of the thirty days whereas in d it is used in the metaphorical sense ‘encompass’, hence ‘achieve’. The two pādas also contrast the series of dawns needed to add up to the thirty-day cycle (c) with what each one of them accomplishes in a single day (d).
