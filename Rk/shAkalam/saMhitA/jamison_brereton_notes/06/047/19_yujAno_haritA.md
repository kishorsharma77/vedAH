This vs. makes a small ring with vs. 15, both containing káḥ + SUBJUNCTIVE. The fact that this vs. is in a different meter (Bṛhatī, not Triṣṭubh) from the whole hymn that precedes it may also signal the end of a section. As indicated in the publ. intro., I think this vs. is meant as reassurance: in contrast to the endlessly multiplying Indra of vs. 18 (and the fickle Indra of the previous vss.), Tvaṣṭar has now taken control, yoking only a single team (for Indra’s journey, in my opinion) and exerting his dominion over forms, thus reining in Indra’s excess shape-shifting.

Although the word rūpá- does not appear in the vs., it can be easily supplied with bhū́ri on the basis of Tvaṣṭar’s well-known role as shaper of forms (cf. Macd., Ved.

Myth. 116, and passages like I.188.9, VIII.10.28, X.100.9, 184.1).

The 2nd hemistich poses a rhetorical question about Indra (unnamed): why would Indra stick by the enemy when our sacrifice is so appealing? We are essentially urging him to switch sides again, and since he does so frequently, we have hope of succeeding. Assuming that pákṣa in sandhi represents pákṣaḥ (so Pp), it belongs to a neut.

s-stem found only here in the RV, but attested in AV and elsewhere. This requires us to allow an acc. with √ās ‘sit’, rather than the usual loc. There is no warrant to emend the accent to pakṣá and take it as a loc. to the -á-stem.

Pāda d constitutes a loc. abs., with the part. ā́sīna- used pregnantly for ‘sitting (a sattra)’. The introductory utá is curious, since there is nothing it can conventionally conjoin. Klein (DGRV 45-56) classifies it with the unclassifiable residue of utá forms, tr. it ‘especially’. The publ. tr. follows this tack. However, I think we can derive it from the standard uses of utá ‘and’. English has an idiom in which ‘and’ is used to add as an afterthought what the speaker considers the clinching, but somewhat off-topic, circumstantial argument -- as in a sequence like “why would he break up with her now-- and with her just graduated?”
