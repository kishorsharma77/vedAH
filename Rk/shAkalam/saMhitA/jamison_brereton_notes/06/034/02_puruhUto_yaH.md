The heavy presence of puru-PAST PART. cmpds in the first hemistich (puruhūtáḥ … purugūrtáḥ … purupraśastáḥ) was prepared for by the fem. pl. pūrvī́ḥ in 1a and the (unrelated) purā́in 1c.

It is difficult to render the gerundive + injunctive phrase anumā́dyo bhūt; “has become one to be cheered on” is excessively fussy.

The instr. asmā́bhiḥ was unaccountably omitted in the publ. tr.: I correct to “… to be cheered on by us.”
