This vs. is unambiguously Triṣṭubh, consisting of two pādas of 11 syllables. The first has an opening of 5, which could be a self-contained pāda of DV, but what follows it is 6 syllables, marking the whole as a single Triṣṭubh pāda. The second part is even less ambiguous, as it has an opening of 4, so a DV division is impossible. The only feature that matches that of DV is that there are only two Triṣṭubh pādas in the vs., not four.
