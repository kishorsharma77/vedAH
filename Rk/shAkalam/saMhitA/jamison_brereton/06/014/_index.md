Agni
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: anuṣṭubh, except śakvarī 6
Though it begins with friendship, insight, and refreshment (vs. 1), this is a martial  hymn, naming Agni as the priest specific to the Ārya (vs. 2) and asking him to give

heroes and victory to the Ārya in their battles with the non-Ārya and to our particu lar group of Ārya in internal conflicts (vss. 3–5). The hymn is noteworthy in using  the metaphor of riches/wealth for an abundance of good fighting men: the phrase  “riches of the stranger” in verse 3 refers, in our opinion, to the manpower of the  Ārya, and this metaphor is repeated in verse 5.
