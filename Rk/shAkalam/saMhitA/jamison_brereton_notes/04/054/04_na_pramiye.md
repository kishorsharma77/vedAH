The standard tr. supply as subj. of pramíye and referent of tád the whole yáthā cl. of b. But one of the most common objects of (prá) √mī is vratá-, and in the preceding Savitar hymn his vratá-s were much in evidence: 4a vratā́ni deváḥ savitā́bhí rakṣate, 4d dhṛtávrataḥ, 5c tríbhir vrataíḥ. I therefore think vratám should be supplied here; among other things this follows directly on the vs. presenting the offenses we may have committed against the gods, and it would be appropriate to reaffirm the importance of not offending Savitar in particular.

I then take the yáthā clause as a purpose clause. We shouldn’t violate Savitar’s commandment because we want him to (continue to) support the world.

Although we generally expect the subjunctive in such clauses, the future is beginning to supercede the subjunctive in general and would make fine sense here. (Re states that this is the only ex. of yáthā with the future.)
