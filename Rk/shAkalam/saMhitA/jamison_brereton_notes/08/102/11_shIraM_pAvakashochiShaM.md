My construction of this vs. follows Ge’s. Re by contrast takes b as a nominal rel. clause and c as the main clause. Since the verb dīdā́ya is initial in its pāda and, as a main-clause verb, could owe its accent to this position, there is no way to tell and no semantic implications. In slight favor of Ge is the fact that √dī is frequently construed with the loc., as it would be with dámeṣu ā́in b.
