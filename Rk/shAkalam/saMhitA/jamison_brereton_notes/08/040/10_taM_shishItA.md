The “eggs” of Śuṣṇa are probably his progeny (so Old, Ge); see X.68.7, adduced by Ge, also X.22.11 śúṣṇasya ... jātáṃ víśvaṃ and X.61.13 śúṣṇasya … puruprajātásya. They can’t be testicles, given the number.

The standard interpr. takes jéṣat (e) as parallel to bhédati (d) and still part of the rel. clause beginning in c, whereas I take it as the verb of the main clause to which the rel. clause is attached. Either is grammatically possible because, if jéṣat is the verb of a main clause, its accent is owing to its initial position. The rel. cl. interpr.

requires that cde all hang off the tám of a, despite the utá. Klein (DGRV I.302) seems to suggest that the verse is structured as an “X and which Y construction” (tám … utá … yáḥ), but as far as I know, the X and Y in such constructions always have different referents.
