The hapax cániṣthad, though fairly clearly a 3rd sg. act. injunctive, is not regularly formed. Whitney (Roots) calls it “plainly corrupt”; Old discusses it at some length and floats various possibilities. Whatever its source, it clearly patterns with the superlative cániṣṭhā in the same metrical position in 8b (so Old, Re). The standard solution, which comes in various guises, has been to posit a more regularly formed verb that has been re-formed (/corrupted) because of the proximity of the splv., either at the time of composition or redactionally. This is the tack Old chooses; of the various underlying possibilities he considers, he favors an -iṣ-aor. subjunctive

*cániṣat (cf. 2nd du. caniṣṭám). See also Hoffmann (MSS 2 [1952/1957] = Aufs. 367;
repeated by Narten, s-aor. 111), who considers the contamination a product of the poet.
