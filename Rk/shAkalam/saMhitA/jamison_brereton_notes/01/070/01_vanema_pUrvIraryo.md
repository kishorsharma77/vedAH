It is perhaps appropriate that this last hymn in the Vaiśvānara series begins with the martial verb vanema “may we vanquish,” since the function of the Vaiśvānara fire is to unite the clans as a force to oppose its enemies.

The Pp. reads manīṣā́; most tr. read manīṣā́(ḥ) (see Old’s disc [Noten]).

However, I take it as both an instr. sg. -ā́and acc. pl. -ā́ḥ, with the poet, as so often, taking advantage of potential ambiguity. This double reading is supported by I.73.9 (also Parāśara’s work), which contains the athem. opt. vanuyāmā corresponding to them. vanéma here and three pairs of instr. + acc.: árvadbhiḥ … árvato nṛ́bhir nṛ́̄n, vīraír vīrā́n vanuyāmā “Might we vanquish steeds with steeds, men with men, and heroes with heroes.”
