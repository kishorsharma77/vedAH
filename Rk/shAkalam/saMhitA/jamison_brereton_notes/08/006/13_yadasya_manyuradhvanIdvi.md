The accented aírayat in c raises questions. It is natural to interpret c as the main clause, in which case we must assume a preverb ā́with an unaccented airayat (see Old ad I.157.5). This is possible semantically and syntactically, but the Pp. does not so analyze. Alternatively we could take all of vs. 13 as a subordinate clause (“when his battle-fury smoked … (and) he sent …”) dependent on the main clause in vs. 14, but this is not attractive, because it not only requires a switch from 3rd ps. to 2nd, but it also yokes together two otherwise independent myths.
