Our thoughts should turn you two hither to our ceremonies; they  keep grooming this drop, the prizewinner—(the drop) swift like a
prizewinning steed.
Drink of these (soma drinks), seeking us; come here to us with help. O Indra and Vāyu, (drink) of them, pressed by stones, you two—(drink)  to exhilaration, you two prize-givers.
