As was just noted, púraḥ completes the acc. phrase navatī́r náva that serves as obj.

to avā́han in 1c, as the parallel IV.26.3 just cited demonstrates. But avā́han has another object in vs. 2, namely śámbaram in b, as shown by a different passage in the Indra cycle of Maṇḍala IV, IV.30.14 ávāhann indra śámbaram.

The third pāda of this vs. is radically incomplete, consisting only of a particle, a demon., and two acc. PNs: ádha tyáṃ turváśam yádum. On purely structural grounds, it would make sense to make these parallel to śámbaram in b, as objects of avā́han (in 1c).

However, this structural argument runs into problems of mythological content. Although Turvaśa and Yadu are sometimes enemies of Indra (see, e.g., VII.19.2), at other times they are under Indra’s protection. In particular, in the Indra cycle from which IV.26.3 and IV.30.14, the parallels to our vss. 1-2ab, were cited above, T + Y are rescued by Indra: IV.30.17 utá tyā́turváśāyádū, … / índraḥ … apārayat “And Indra brought these two, T + Y, to the far shore,” just three vss. later than the smiting of Śambara. Note further that IV.30.17a is very like our pāda, a dimeter line with an intro. disyllabic connective, a form of the demonstr. syá- / tyá-, and the two names, though with a dual dvandva turváśāyádū rather than two individual acc. sgs. On this basis, I’m afraid the simple solution of taking T + Y as further victims of Indra should be abandoned, in favor of supplying (or at least assuming) a positive verb to govern them, such as Ge’s (n. 2c) “errettete” or Re’s “sauva.”
