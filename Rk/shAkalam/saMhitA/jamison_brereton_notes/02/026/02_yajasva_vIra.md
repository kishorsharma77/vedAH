The impv. vihi, with short root vowel (also III.21.5, IV.48.1, and possibly VI.48.17), must belong to the root pres. of √vī ‘pursue’, whose properly formed 2nd sg. impv. is vīhí (7x). The easiest way to explain its short vowel is by analogy to ihí belonging to the root pres. to √i ‘go’, with pres. indic. émi, éṣi, éti, and impv. étu, all strikingly well attested, which match vémi, véṣi, véti, and vétu.

Its object, manāyatáḥ, is ambiguous and for that reason its referent is not clear. Its base manā́- means something like ‘zeal’, a meaning found also in other derivatives to it, but zeal can be positively or negatively viewed; for a negative occurrence see nearby II.33.5. In our passage Gr, Re, and Ge [/WG] take it positively, referring to gods (Gr, Re) or priests (Ge), while Schmidt (B+I 115), flg.

Ludwig, negatively, referring to enemies. My tr. is meant to be neutral, since I think both are simultaneously possible.
