This vs. is conceptually, lexically, and syntactically similar to VI.48.22; see extensive disc. ad loc., with ref. to other passages alluding to this mythological event.

For nā́ma pátya- “own a name,” cf. II.37.2 dadír yó nā́ma pátyate “who owns the name ‘giver’,” adduced by Re.

The 2nd hemistich consists of a truncated anyá- … anyá- construction, with the 2nd anyá- gapped. This implicitly contrastive structure must account for the accent on pīpā́ya in the first clause.

Contra the standard interpr. (Old, Ge, Re), I take śukrám and ū́dhaḥ separately, as the double acc. obj. of √duh, rather than having the former an adj. modifying ‘udder’, also in other relevant passages that contain the same two words (II.34.2, IV.3.10).
