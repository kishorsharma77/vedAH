Ge takes b in semi-independence of a: “… für die Lohngewinnung nicht gering zu schätzen.” This seems to be because of VII.67.5, which, however, doesn't seem to be parallel enough to require this interpretation here.

Note the phonological similarity of the value-heavy words marḍitā́ram (1b), mṛḷaya (1c, 2c), belonging to √mṛḍ ‘have mercy’, and ámṛdhraḥ ‘not shirking, not neglectful’.
