All Gods
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn has even less interest in individual gods than the most recent in this All  God series. Instead the sacrifice is again the focus: it is set in motion in verses 1–2,  with the priests exhorted to perform the ritual actions in the latter verse. The gods’  attendance is described in verses 3–4, and the poet’s relative indifference to their  individual identities is expressed in the phrase “however many you are” at the end  of verse 4. Appropriate to the ritual focus, Agni is the only god named (besides a  glancing reference to Heaven and Earth in vs. 1), and his actions and companion
ship are crucial to our well-being.
