Ge takes sāptá- as “der treuen Freundschaft,” presumably as a derivative of sápti- ‘team’ (see his sim. derivation in VIII.41.4 and my comm. thereon). But it does not make sense to deny a numerical value for sāptá- here, since it is found in clearly numerical sense in nearby VIII.59.5 (Vālakh.) tríbhiḥ sāptébhiḥ.
