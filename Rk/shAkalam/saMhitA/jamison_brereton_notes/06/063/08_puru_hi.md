The hapax ásakrām is another proleptic adj. (see 6d). This fem. sg. can apply equally to the two fem. sgs. dhenúm and iṣám.

The ánu that has not yielded completely satisfactory sense in 6c and 7d here is entirely at home: the various ritual offerings to the Aśvins, both verbal (stútaḥ … suṣṭutíḥ) and physical (rásāḥ, the soma juices), accrue to them following the gift they bestow on the sacrificers.
