To avoid vegetative confusion, ‘fruitful’ would be better tr. as ‘profitable’ (ápnasvatīm). See ápnaḥ in the next hymn (I.113.9d).

Ge tr. adyūtyé as “wo nicht der Würfel entscheidet”; this is certainly possible, but I think it more likely refers to a situation dire enough that we don’t want to take chances.
