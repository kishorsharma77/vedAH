The standard tr. take mahī́in pāda a as a loc sg. (Ge ‘auf Erden’). Since loc. sg. -ī is extremely rare, I prefer to take it as the du. nom./acc. it appears to be, referring to the two world halves (see ródasī in 1c) in an unmarked simile.

In b the root noun tújaḥ is grammaticaly ambiguous; with Gr, Ge, WG, Schindler (RtNoun) I take it as nom. pl., against Re (gen. sg.). (Old considers both nom. and acc. pl., without deciding.) The image, in my view, is of a herd of cows milling around in confusion on the ritual ground, but not raising dust as a real herd would do -- because, after all, the “cows” are really milk.

In cd, following Re’s interpr., I see reference to the times of the three soma pressings. With Re I tr. uparátāti as zenith, referring to the sun’s position at the Midday Pressing; ā́nimrúcaḥ is an abl. with ā́“until its setting,” referring to the Third (or evening) Pressing. Unlike Re I do not take uṣásaḥ as ‘à l’aurore’ (as if a loc. sg.), but rather as an acc. of extent of time, “through the dawns,” though an abl. sg.

with the preceding ā́(Ge “(bis) zum Morgen”) might be possible -- in any case, a ref.

to the Morning Pressing.

On takvavī́- see also I.134.5. The stem occurs also in X.91.2, which is perhaps the passage in which the ‘bird’ sense is the clearest. Although ‘swoopingly/swiftly pursuing’ need not have a bird as its referent, and in our passage here the standard tr.

take it as simply a pursuer (presumably human; e.g., Ge [/WG] Verfolger), I am inclined to take it as a bird of prey rather than simply a hunter, because taktá (and other √tak forms) seem to be used esp. of birds and beasts considered to be like them; see comm. ad IX.32.4. In our passage the point of comparison between the cows in the frame and the takvavī́- has to be the crying out (sváranti), which fits the sharp squawking of birds of prey, but not the general behavior of human hunters.
