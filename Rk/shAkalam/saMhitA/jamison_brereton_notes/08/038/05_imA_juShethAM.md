Pāda b is somewhat awkward because it states that both Indra and Agni carry oblations. Ge gets out of the difficulty by making the oblations an acc. of goal with an intransitive reading of ūháthuḥ (“… ihr zu den Opfergaben gefahren sind”), but Old convinces me (ad I.84.18, with a number of parallel passages) that we cannot sidestep the transitivity in these expressions (√vah + oblation(s)). In this particular case we can attribute the transitive phrase to a feature of Indra and Agni hymns noted in the publ. intro., that both gods get credited with actions or qualities appropriate to only one of them, and Agni is of course the conveyor of oblations par excellence.
