The pāda-final sáhasā sáhasvān is morphologically entirely parallel to 4d tápasā tápasvān.

In d tád may not be a temporal adverb as in the publ. tr., but a neut. acc. obj.

of juṣasva, with which ‘speech’ vel sim. should be supplied. So Ge and Re -- e.g., Ge “so freue dich an diesem (Gedicht) des Sängers.” However, since √juṣ can take a gen. complement (though more rarely than the acc.), jaritúḥ may be construed directly with the verb, as in the publ. tr.

On ghóṣi, which I take as an anomalous -si imperative, see comm. ad IV.4.8, which contains the other occurrence of this form. On the possible relationship between ghóṣi and śróṣi in VI.4.7, see comm. ad loc.
