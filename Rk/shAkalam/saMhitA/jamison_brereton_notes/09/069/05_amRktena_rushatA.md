The repetition of a passively used part. to √mṛj, intens. marmṛjāná-, matching mṛjyámāna- in the opening pāda of the previous vs. 4a, situates us in the same ritual context as that vs. Again Soma sets out on his journey beyond the filter, through the territory that here is configured as “between the two worlds” (ubhé antā́ ródasī).

Forms of the root √hṛṣ sometimes take dat. infinitives; cf. VIII.19.19 ágne hárṣasva dā́tave “O Agni, be roused to give” (sim. IV.21.9). Contrary to the standard tr., I therefore construe indriyā́ya dhā́yase with harṣate. The adj. indriyá- lit.

‘Indriyan, relating / appropriate to Indra’ has personal reference here (as also in the same phrase in IX.86.3): “for Indra’s suckling.” On śurúdh- see, inter alia, KEWA, EWA both s.v., Thieme 1941 (=KlSch 338-49), Scar 63, 464. The etymology is disputed, in part because the segmentation of this disyllable is unclear: śur-údh or śu-rúdh-. The former is supposed to be parallel to a putative *iṣ-údh- found in the denom. iṣudhyá-, but I have suggested a different etym. for this word: see comm. ad I.128.6 and my forthcoming “ “Vedic iṣudhyá- and Old Avestan išud-, išūidiia-: The Aim of Praise.” The latter segmentation is favored by Thieme, who derives it from *(p)śu-rúdh- ‘das Vieh mehrend’. Scar (464) objects that we would then expect *śū-rúdh- (like anū-rúdh-, vī-rúdh-), but that is precisely what needs to be read here (see already Gr); otherwise the cadence is the very bad - ⏑ ⏑ ⏑ x. No other forms of the stem occur in the cadence; of the other 9 attestations, 5 are found after an early caesura, where a heavy first syllable would change the standard break ⏑ ⏑ - to a still very common - ⏑ -; the other 4 occur after a late caesura ending with a heavy syllable, where - / - ⏑ would definitely be less acceptable than the normal - / ⏑ ⏑ produced by reading a light first syllable. On the whole I am inclined to accept Thieme’s etymology, at least in preference to one based on a 2nd member -udh, and to assume an original *śūrúdh-, at home here and possibly in the 5 forms after early caesura, whose first syllable was ultimately shortened by analogy to compds in su-.
