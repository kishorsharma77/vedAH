The thrust of this vs. is a pile-up of adjectives describing Agni’s flamehorses, set within a frame consisting of the verb úpa yujyante “they are harnessed,” postponed until the final pāda, and a dative of benefit occurring in the first: mánave mānavasyaté.

mānavasyaté is found only here, and both its sense and its formation are unclear. It is generally rendered as if it were a denominative (Ge ‘dem Menschenfreundlichen’, Re ‘agissant en homme’), but this would assume a -yáformation built to a vṛddhi-derivative pseudo-s-stem *mānavas- (beside mānavá-, loosely like mánus- beside mánu-). I instead interpret it as a (pseudo-)future participle in -syánt- built to the common vṛddhi deriv. mānava-. The future suffix reinforces the sense of the vṛddhi deriv. ‘descending from Manu’ by emphasizing the fact that (some of) these descendants are still to come. (If such a derivation seems too radical, it could be mediated by a denom. *mānava-yá- + -syánt-, which underwent haplology.) asamaná- means lit. something like ‘not together, not gathered’; ‘breaking ranks’ seems a dynamic tr. of the underlying concept (Re ‘allant en sens divers’).

(See also VII.5.3.) It thus forms a semantic pair with mumukṣvàḥ ‘seeking to break free’ in a. I do not follow Ge (/WG) in their derivation from the extended meaning of sámana- as ‘battle’, hence (Ge) ‘ohne Kampf’.

Note the phonetic figure opening the vs.: mumukṣvò mánave mānavasyaté.
