tiráś cittā́ni is a striking expression, without obvious parallels. In interpreting it, we can begin by noting that tiráś cid is a reasonably frequent pāda opening (IV.29.1, V.75.7, VIII.33.14, 51.9, 66.12), including in the next hymn, VII.60.6. Although I toyed with the possibility of reading tiráś cit tā́ni here, with the neut. pl. prn., this does not seem to be productive. However, the fact that tiráś cid is a formulaic expression may help account for the fact that our tiráś cittā́ni seems to be only loosely connected syntactically to the rest of the clause. Ge takes the expression as meaning “against/contrary to expectation” (wider Erwartung), but I’m not at all sure that tiráḥ can mean ‘against’ (though see X.171.4 devā́nāṃ cit tiró váśam “even 96 athwart the will of the gods”). And in any case we would surely want to punish someone who tried to kill us, whether we expected him to or not. Re’s “en croisant (nos) pensées” is better; I have adapted an English idiom “cross-purposes,” which is practically a calque on the Skt. phrase. Here it reflects the hostility between the would-be attacker and “us.”
