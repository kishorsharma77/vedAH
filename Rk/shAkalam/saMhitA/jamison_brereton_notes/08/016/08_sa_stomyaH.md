The content of ab is straightforward, but it is worth noting the phonological play. On the one hand the independent pronouns sá … sá of pāda a are picked up in b by sa(tyáḥ) sá(tvā́). On the other, the morphologically parallel forms stómi yaḥ ... hávi yaḥ in a are picked up by the morphologically different satyáḥ in b.

(This would be a neater figure if the first two words didn’t show distraction in the suffix, as opposed to satyá-.) Then the -tyáḥ of satyáḥ morphs into the -tvā́of satvā́, which then distracts into tuvi- in the following word.
