The semi-direct speech and esp. the casual conversational tone of this verse are quite unusual for the RV. Although most tr. take the whole as indirect speech (“Soma said to me that…”), the construction of the verse seems to me to mix direct and indirect speech, with c, couched in the acc., shading into indirect speech. I take the final pāda separately, as it is absent from the parallel in X.9.6.

Note the distraction of the apsú antár phrase that opens 19a into two pāda opening words: 20a #apsú … b #antár.
