My tr. of bruvāṇáḥ “when called upon” follows Thieme’s (Mitra and Aryaman, p. 69), which in turn follows Meillet’s ([1907] “quand il est invoqué”; see Thieme p. 40). Ge and Re both take bruvāṇáḥ as pass./reflex. ‘be called, call oneself’ with mitráh as predicate (e.g., “der Mitra (Freund) heisst”). I now think something halfway between is probably correct. When √brū is not cmpded with a preverb, it does not seem to take an acc. of addressee, so my passive version with addressee as subj., “when called upon,” is probably wrong. However, I don’t think it’s a mere naming construction. Rather, Thieme’s 1st tr. (p. 40) “Contract, when named …” conveys the intent better: that, when the word -- and god -- alliance/Alliance is spoken at the concluding of a pact, the pact acquires its efficacy. JPB’s tr. of the almost identical III.59.1 “Mitra arranges the peoples when (Alliance) is declared” cleverly plays on the ambiguity of the word mitrá-, and I would substitute something like that here.
