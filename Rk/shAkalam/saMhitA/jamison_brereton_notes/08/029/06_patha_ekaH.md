Ge tr. pīpāya as ‘bewacht’ and assigns it to √pā ‘protect’ (via a byform √pi), because he finds “swell the paths” semantically difficult. But ‘swell’ in the RV universe of discourse is associated with prosperity and abundance, and swelling the paths can simply refer to making them productive and full of the treasure mentioned in the 2nd pāda. Since Pūṣan, the referent of this verse, ensures that livestock find their way home, is associated with paths, and is called “lord of the path” (VI.53.1 pathas pate), the metaphorical expression “swell the paths” makes sense as a description of his activities.

What may have tipped the balance for Ge is the simile in this pāda, “like a thief,” for it hard to explain how a thief would “swell the paths” -- whereas keeping a close watch on the path (as a semantic extension of ‘protect, guard’) is something a thief, or highwayman, would naturally do. Old is forced to suggest that the thief makes the paths prosperous for himself in his own way, presumably by robbing people who are traveling on them (sim. Re). But there is a simple solution to the simile problem: take it with the 2nd pāda as I have done (sim. Macd., Maurer).

Although up to this point in the hymn, pāda boundaries coincide with syntactic boundaries, the poet is starting to shake up the structure, which has been quite static so far, and breaching the pāda break is his first step. Bolder moves follow in the next vss.
