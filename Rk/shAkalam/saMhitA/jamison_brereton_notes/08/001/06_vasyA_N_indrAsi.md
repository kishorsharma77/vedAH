Pāda c contains a cute and tricky construction: a conjoined nominative subject of a 2nd ps. dual verb, with one of the subjects gapped. That is, underlying

*tvám mātā́ca “you and a mother” is reduced to mātā́ca, with the other subject only
detectable in the verb chadayathaḥ and implied by the ca. Similar gapping with the 1st dual is found, e.g., in VII.88.3 ā́yád ruhā́va váruṇaś ca nā́vam “When we two, (I) and Varuṇa, mounted the boat…,” VIII.69.7 úd yád … gṛhám índraś ca gánvahi “when we two, (I) and Indra, go up to his house….” Both constructions are somewhat reminiscent of the vā́yav índraś ca construction, though that does not involve gapping.

The sentiment of the verse is likewise a bit tricky. In ab the poet dismisses father and brother as providing no benefit, in contrast to Indra, who is “good for goods” (cd), but Indra is equated (positively) with a mother, who would in this society of course have little or no control over goods and giving (as opposed to the father and brother).
