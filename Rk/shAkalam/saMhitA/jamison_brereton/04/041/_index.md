Indra and Varuṇa
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
Though immediately preceding the great Indra–Varuṇa dialogue hymn IV.42, with  its themes of contested sovereignty and complementary divine and human royal functions, this hymn, also dedicated to Indra and Varuṇa, is a relatively simple and  straightforward joint praise of and appeal to the two divinities as an undifferenti ated pair. The poet speaks repeatedly of his desire for the friendship and compan ionship of the two gods, repeatedly asks them for their help, and seeks material gain  from them as well. Although the gods are not treated separately, the contents reflect  Indra’s qualities more than Varuṇa’s, for the two are especially beseeched for aid in  defeating rivals in contest and battles (vss. 2, 4, 6, 7, 11, with imagery derived from  contests in vss. 8–9).
