On the lexeme medial ví √pā ‘extract by drinking, separate fluids by drinking’ see disc. ad VII.22.4. Why this lexeme is used here of an ant (or someone so called) isn’t clear. Perhaps it reflects a folk belief or observation about the eating/drinking habits of ants. Popular Science Monthly (of May 1877) reports that “Some species—such, for instance, as the small brown garden ant—ascend bushes in search of aphides. The ant then taps the aphis gently with her antennæ, and the aphis emits a drop of sweet fluid, which the ant drinks.” This could possibly be considered extraction. And a more recent article (Smithsonian.com, Aug. 16, 2012) has photographs of transparent Indian ants whose abdomens change color depending on the color of what they drink. The photographs of the ants’ mouth parts attempting to penetrate drops of colored water could also be viewed as extraction.
