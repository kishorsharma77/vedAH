Agni and the Maruts  
Medhātithi Kāṇva  
9 verses: gāyatrī  
The divinity pairing in this hymn—the fire-god Agni and the stormy troop of  Maruts—is an uncommon one and makes little mythological sense and little sense in  R̥gvedic ritual (though in later śrauta ritual there is an Āgnimāruta śastra recited in  the Third Pressing). In fact the pairing exists in this hymn only in its refrain; the first  two pādas of each verse are directed at one or the other: Agni in verses 1, 2, and 9,  the Maruts in vss. 4–8. All of the Marut verses are structured as definitional relative  clauses beginning with yé “which ones, those who,” following the model of hymns  like II.12, and the contents are typical Marut themes. Verse 3 is a curious exception,  for pāda b names the All Gods (or “all the gods”) though in a context and with  a predicate (pāda a) appropriate to the Maruts—and beginning with the same yé.  Medhātithi also identifies the Maruts with the All Gods elsewhere (I.23.10).
