 Those seeking aid, paired in opposition, have yanked you back and  forth, at the winning of the cowpen, as they set (the cows) free—being  victorious (over the cowpen), as they set (them) free, o Indra—  
when you shove together the two peoples who are seeking cows and  going to (the winning of) the sun,  
as you constantly display the bull partnered with (you)—the mace  
partnered with (you), Indra.
