I follow Ge in taking this vs. as direct speech.

Although Ge’s tr. of rándhi- in b as “schwache Stelle” is appealing, I preferred to register the etymological figure between the verb of pāda a, rāradhuḥ, and this noun.

Note the close sandhi rāradhuṣ ṭe, which reminds us of vidúṣ kavíḥ (2a) and paśúṣ kavíḥ (8d), as well as correct āsúś canéd (9b).

The rel. prn. yáḥ is too deep in its clause, following both direct objects of kṛṇóti: mártān … stuvatáḥ and énaḥ. I have no explan. for this violation.
