The two goddesses deserving the sacrifice, along with the gods  
deserving the sacrificeâ€”they stay, not confounding (the heavenly  
commandments) [/not altering (their color)], growing strong  
[/dripping (ghee)],  
truthful, without deceit, the two whose children are the gods, the  
two leaders of the sacrifice with its gleaming chants [/with their  
gleaming rays].
