Pāda a consists of the etymologically identical phrases tvótāsaḥ ‘aided by you’ and távā́vasā ‘with your help’, both containing forms of the 2nd sg. prn. and nominal forms of √av ‘help, aid’.

Pāda b contains a curious verbal periphrasis, syā́ma vanvántaḥ “may we be combatting,” with opt. to √as as aux. plus the pres. act, part. to vanóti. This expression does not seem to be conveying anything different from the opt. to the same pres. stem, vanuyā́ma (5x), e.g., X.38.3 tváyā vayáṃ tā́n [śátrūn] vanuyāma “With you might we combat those (rivals).” As noted above, vratá- in this pāda may have been chosen to recall vṛtráphonologically, forming a faint ring with the √vṛ forms in 22 vṛtrā́ya … vavrivā́ṃsam. It may even be that jāgṛhi ‘be watchful’ evokes a form of √han, as in 20a jághnir vṛtrám; see also jahī́in 26b.
