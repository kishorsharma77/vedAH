On pári bā́dhaḥ see comm. ad IX.105.6. Both there and here I suggest a haplology of the finite impv. bādhasva, in the putative sequence pári *bādhasva bā́dhaḥ -- rather than accepting the BR / Gr emendation to *paribā́dhaḥ, accepted by Old. If we accept that emendation and make *paribā́dhaḥ another acc. obj. of jahī́, parallel to mṛ́dhaḥ, the accent on jahī́is unexplained.
