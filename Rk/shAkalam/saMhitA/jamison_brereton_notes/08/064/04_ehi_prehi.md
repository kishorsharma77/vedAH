I take kṣáyo diví as a nominal sentence, parenthetically inserted, rather than interpreting kṣáyaḥ as a 2nd sg. verb form, as most others do. See Old on the two possibilities. Although it makes some complications for the syntax, I prefer the nominal interpretation both because kṣáya- is, as Old says, a favored noun in this group of hymns and because a verbal kṣáyaḥ should be a subjunctive and I do not see what the subjunctive would be conveying here. (Ge tr. it as a straight indicative, which avoids the difficulty but contravenes the morphology.) Stating that Indra’s dwelling is in heaven makes clear why we command him to “go forth” in order to “come here.”
