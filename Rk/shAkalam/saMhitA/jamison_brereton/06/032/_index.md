Indra  
Suhotra Bhāradvāja  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
Unlike the common practice, whereby the final verse of the hymn constitutes the  poet’s summing up of his hymn, in this hymn the first verse serves this purpose, in  meta-relationship with what follows. The remaining verses, each of which begins  with the pronoun sá “he,” constitute the praise the poet announced in verse 1. Verses  2–3 refer to the Vala myth, with special attention paid to Indra’s companions in this  enterprise, the unnamed Aṅgirases, and verse 5 may be an oblique account of the  aftermath of the Vr̥tra slaying. In verse 4 Indra is exhorted to grant the singer pow  
ers and riches.
