Ge takes the impv. út tiṣṭha as another self-address of the poet; again the presence of a 1st ps. sg. in the vs. (hvaye in d) makes that unlikely. I think it is directed rather at Agni, like the direct addresses in vss. 1 and 2. For the same impv.

cf. IV.4.4 úd agne tiṣṭha (sim. VIII.23.5): the ritual fire is blazing up while the Maruts are called to the sacrifice. In this case Agni may be commanded to rise up with praises (stómaiḥ) -- praises like his calls in 2c. Alternatively, there may be a clause break after the impv., with a new clause beginning with nūnám and continuing to the end of the vs. (This division was suggested by Natalie Operstein in class in the early 2000s.) The praises will then be those produced by the 1st ps. poet who is the subj. of hvaye at the end of the vs. In b sámukṣita- can hardly be separated from nearby V.55.3 sākám ukṣitā́ḥ, and V.57.8 brhád uk ̥ ṣámāṇāḥ also supports the root etym. to √vakṣ/ukṣ ‘be(come) strong’, against Gr’s conection with √ukṣ ‘sprinkle’.
