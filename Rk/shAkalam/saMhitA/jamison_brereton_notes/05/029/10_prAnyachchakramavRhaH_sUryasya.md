In the publ. tr. I take kútsāya primarily with pāda a, though syntactically and metrically it should go with b. I would now emend the tr. to “the other you made into wide space for Kutsa to drive” or “… for Kutsa for driving.” I’m not sure how a wheel can become a wide space -- what sounds like a kind of highway -- but the addition of Kutsa doesn’t make it any less comprehensible.

I take anā́saḥ ‘mouthless’ as proleptic, describing the state of the Dasyus after Indra has finished crushing them (sim. to I.32.6 *anā́ḥ pipiṣe), while Ge [/WG] take it as a standing characteristic of the Dasyus (“mouthless Dasyus”). There is no way to tell.
