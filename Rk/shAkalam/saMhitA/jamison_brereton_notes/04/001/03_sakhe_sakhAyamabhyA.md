The injunc. vidaḥ is functionally multivalent, but usually interpr. as an impv.

(so Ge, Re, though not WG). On this form see comm. ad I.42.7-9 and IX.20.3. I would now allow an alternative translation as impv.: “find grace …” The final pāda (g) is a combination of the opening of c (asmábhyam dasma) and the ending of f (śáṃ kṛdhi).
