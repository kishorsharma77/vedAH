Although the stem viśvá-janya- is of course a bahuvrīhi and has the basic meaning ‘possessing all peoples’ vel sim., the point here must be that all peoples prepare soma for Indra, hence my ‘stemming from all peoples’ referring to the soma drinks. The reciprocity between the people’s offering of exhilarating drinks and Indra’s apportioning of prizes (c) is clear.

The publ. tr. renders the injunc. dhāráyathāḥ as a present; it could also have past value: “when/as you upheld …” As it is elsewhere (cf. W. E. Hale, Ásura- in Early Vedic Religion, 59-62), asuryà- ‘lordship’ is ascribed to Indra, and the fact that he maintains this lordship ‘among the gods’ (devéṣu) demonstrates once again that devá- / ásura- is not yet an antithetical or hostile pairing in the RV. This same Indra cycle contains a similar expression: VI.20.2 ánu … asuryàṃ devébhir dhāyi víśvam.
