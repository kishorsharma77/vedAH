I take the construction √dhā ACC [anim.] ACC.ADJ -mant-/vant- to mean “provide someone (X) with something (Y),” lit. “establish X as possessing (-mant- /vant-) Y.” The datives of ab are then further objects to aspire to: once the poets have brilliance, they can use that brilliance, which transforms into poems, in pursuit of more worldly goals, the prize, etc. This interpr. essentially follows Ge’s.
