You, Agni, are born as strongest by your strength, most tempestuous,  for the divine conclave—like wealth for the divine conclave—
for most tempestuous is your exuberance and most brilliant your  resolve—
and then they attentively surround you, o unaging one—like obedient  (servants), o unaging one.
