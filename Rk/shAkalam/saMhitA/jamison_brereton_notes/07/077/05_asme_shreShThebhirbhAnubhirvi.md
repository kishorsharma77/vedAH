I take the two ca’s in cd as marking a “both … and” construction: íṣaṃ ca … gómad áśvāvad ráthavac ca rā́dhaḥ “both refreshment and largesse in cattle, horses, (and) chariots.” Though ordinarily we might expect the 2nd ca to be placed after the first term in the second constituent (hence* gómac ca …), I explain its late position as resulting from treating the three parallel -vat adjectives as a unitary qualifier; it also allows the complementary placements of ca in cd: #X ca ..., ... ca Y#.

Klein interprets the passage very differently, taking the two ca’s as independent: the first as conjoining the two participial clauses in bc (… pratirántī … / … ca …  104 dádhatī …)(DGRV I.104-5) and the second as an XYZ ca construction, conjoining the -vat adjectives (86 and passim).
