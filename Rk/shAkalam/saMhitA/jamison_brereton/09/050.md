Soma Pavamāna
Ucathya Āṅgirasa
5 verses: gāyatrī
The next three hymns (IX.50–52) are attributed to the same poet, who is not otherwise  found in the R̥gveda. This hymn has a distinct focus on sound, that of Soma as he is  being prepared (vs. 1), of (probably) the officiating priests (vs. 3), and of the ritual  chant (vs. 4). A potential pun in verse 2 suggests that the priestly voices there are both  competing with each other and seeking the sacrificial reward. Verse 5 contains another  potential pun, with the same word (aktú) meaning both “ointments” and “nights.”
## 1
Your snortings rise up like the roar of the wave of a river.
Spur on the wheel-rim of the music.
## 2
At your stimulus there rise up three voices ready for combat [/seeking  bounty],
when you go onto the back of the sheep.
## 3
On the sheep’s fleece with stones they drive the dear tawny one around, purifying himself, dripping with honey.
## 4
Purify yourself in a stream in the filter, you most exhilarating poet, to sit in the womb of chant.
## 5
Purify yourself, most exhilarating one, being anointed with cows as  ointments [/through the nights],
o drop, for Indra to drink.
