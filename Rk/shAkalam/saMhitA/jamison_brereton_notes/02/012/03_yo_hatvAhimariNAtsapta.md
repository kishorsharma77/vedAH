yó gā́udā́jad ápa hí valáṃ váḥ. The alternative lexeme may have been used here because a root noun to √vṛ, vṛ-t- with empty -t as always with roots ending in short resonants, risks being mistaken for a root noun to √vṛt.

Because starting fires with stones is not the standard method in the RV -- it usually involves fire sticks -- I think the “between the two stones” (áśmanor antár) probably refers to the two world halves between which fire would appear, perhaps in addition to stones struck against each other to produce sparks. If I am correct that this is a reference to the world-halves, it would provide some support to the claim that the meaning ‘heaven’ for this etymon, attested in both branches of Old Iranian (asmanin both YAves and OP), was pan-Indo-Iranian, a contested claim (see EWA s.v. áśman-, esp. p. 138).
