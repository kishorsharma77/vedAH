It is possible to take prá śaṃsā as 1st sg. subjunctive, as Re. does, though there seems no compelling reason not to continue with a 2nd sg. impv., following the 2nd pl.

gāyata in the previous pāda (4c).

Pāda b seems an incipient izafe construction, with an appositive introduced by yád -- even though it is grammatically impeccable as a standard rel. cl. (allowing for the attraction in gender to neut. yád of putative *yám, whose antecedent ághnyam is masc.).

Ge unaccountably interprets the med. pf. vāvṛdhe as a 1st sg. (“Ich habe mich … gestärkt”; so also WG), though he doesn’t read prá śaṃsā in a as 1st ps. Although this is grammatically possible, context suggests that the Marut troop is the subj. of this verb.
