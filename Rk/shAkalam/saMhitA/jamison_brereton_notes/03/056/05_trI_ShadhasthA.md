On this vs. see Thieme, Untersuchung 43-44 and 47-48. He is responsible for the second interpr. of vidátheṣu in b. See also vidátha- in III.38.5-6, a passage already adduced above ad vs. 3, and comm. thereon: ‘cosmic division’ seems the most likely interpr. of the stem there.

The three watery maidens in c may be evaluated in conjunction with II.5.5, also with the three (apparently watery) women who nourish Apām Napāt in II.35.5, and perhaps with the three goddesses of the Āprī hymns (Sarasvatī, Idā, and Bharatī).

Who they are here and what they are doing are unclear to me.

In d pátyamānāḥ ‘acting the master’ may be a sly joke, since it has females as its subj. and it was just used (3c) for the hyper-virile inseminator.
