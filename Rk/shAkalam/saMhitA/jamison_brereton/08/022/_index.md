The metrical complexity of this hymn is not matched by corresponding complexity  of content. The hymn focuses especially on the chariot of the Aśvins, as well as on  their journey to us, the sacrifice with which we will welcome them, and the multi form aid we hope for in return.
Nonetheless there are a few striking images and turns of phrase, particularly in  verse 6 where the Aśvins “plow barley with a wolf,” an expression that cannot be sep arated from the similar one in I.117.21, likewise an Aśvin hymn, where they “scatter  barley with a wolf.” Starting with Yaska (6.26), the “wolf” has regularly been identi fied as a type of plow, though this recourse to agricultural technology could be taken  as a reductive attempt to explain away the wondrous nature of the Aśvins’ feats—here  perhaps their ability to harness the power of a dangerous and semi-wild beast for a  civilizing task. On the wolf as a cross-category in the Vedic conceptual universe, situ ated between the wild and the civilized and partaking of both, see Jamison (2008b).
