Ge takes priyā́as nom. sg. fem., with gapped “Daughter of the Sun” -- but it seems unlikely that a new character would be introduced at this point, and it makes more sense for Soma to be the one doing the looking. Better to interpr. priyā́as a neut. pl. with gapped padā́(ni), as in nearby IX.12.8 abhí priyā́divás padā́. Ge (n. 9a) also allows the possibility of a neut. pl., but wants to construe it with sg. pádam, which he takes as a “collective singular,” a concept that I think we can do without but that seems to be encouraged by Old’s remarks. (See comm. ad VI.17.1 for another such ex. proposed by Ge.) I think rather that there are two (sets of) padá- (sim. Re).

Ge also suggests that in this instance of INSTR. gúhā hitám, the phrase means “hidden from,” not “hidden by.” Without a better sense of what this vs. is intended to tell us, I prefer not to contravene the usual agentive value of the instr. For my own speculation on the hidden track, see publ. intro., which may be supported by IX.102.2, where the hidden track that soma follows seems to be in the filter.
