The last pāda here again has a real verb ‘let hear’ (śṛṇotu), not simply ‘be’, and śám is thus displaced from predicated nominative (“X be luck”) to adverbial usage (“for luck”), with naḥ correspondingly promoted from dative (“for us”) to acc. obj. of the verb (“hear us”). Note that this same construction might be found in pāda b and c, which lack verbs, while pāda a must follow the usual pattern because of its astu. Thus bc possibly, “let Varuṇa … (hear us); let Rudra … (hear) us.” However, I think it likely that b+c simply follow a. In any case it’s striking (or at least striking in a hymn that otherwise has so little variation) that the verbal construction changes within the vs., while the pattern of personnel is rigidly fixed: each pāda contains a single god as subject with an instr. pl. of his entourage.
