Dawn It is worth noting that the nom. (and voc.) pl. of uṣás- is consistently uṣásaḥ in this hymn (every vs. but 10), with short suffixal vowel -- the newer form replacing inherited uṣā́saḥ.

As disc. in the publ. intro., this is an omphalos hymn, with the middle verse 6 posing the central question. This omphalos is surrounded by concentric rings: divó duhitáro vibhātī́ḥ of 1c is answered by the same phrase (in the voc.) in 10a and 11a, while vss. 5 and 7 contain an inner ring with ṛtá- (ṛtayúbhiḥ 5a, ṛtájātasatyāḥ 7b) and sadyáḥ (5b, 7d). There is also much lexical chaining between adjacent vss.
