The second half-verse does not work as Dvipadā Virāj, since it would have pādas of 4 and 6 syllables. It has long been suggested (for reff. see Old SBE and HvN comm., both ad loc.) that putting devó devā́nām in the opposite order would fix this problem. However, Old argues in the Proleg. (97) that this is unnecessary, that Dvipadā Virāj has an affinity to Triṣṭubh, and that this line, though 10 syllables, configures itself nearly as a Triṣṭubh. See I.67.9 above.

The verb pári … bhuvat lacks overt object, and various suggestions have been made. I assume that its object is the same as the object of 1cd “the still and the moving.” Hoffmann (sim. WG) tr. the verb simply as “überragt” (stands out), but this interpr. ignores the emphasis on “encompassing” in this set of hymn (see disc. ad I.65.3).

The unaccented gen. pl. eṣām presents a problem similar to that posed by āsām in vs. 7, though I account for them in different ways. Given its lack of accent, eṣām should be a pronominal, not adjectival, demonstrative, but it appears to be construed with víśveṣām … devā́nām “of all these gods.” Because devā́nām is fairly distant from both eṣām and víśveṣām and appears to be bound to immediately preceding deváḥ, I would now take eṣām … víśveṣām together, separate from devā́nām and emend the tr. to “When alone of all these, the god among the gods, encompasses …” Though it may be difficult to maintain this in the face of vs. 7, as I argue in the forthcoming article cited above, the poet is doling out the genitive plurals here and does not want to specify that “these all” are the gods until the last minute, since masc. pl. “all” in this hymn otherwise refers to the unified worshipers of the Vaiśvānara fire.
