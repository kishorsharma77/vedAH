As Ge (n. 1a) and Re indicate, the opening of this hymn, with prá bráhmaitu (that is, bráhma etu), is very like the opening of nearby VII.34.1 prá śukraítu (=śukrā́etu) … manīṣā́, with both referring to the beginning of the ritual day with the dispatch of the poets’ verbal offering to the gods.

Note the figure ví … sasṛje (b) / ví … sasre (c), both with 3rd sg. mid. perfects built to phonologically similar roots and compounded (in tmesis) with the same preverb.

Narten (1969 “Ai. sṛ in synchronischer und diachronischer Sicht” = Kl. Sch.

135-41) recognizes two synchronically distinct roots √sṛ, primarily act. ‘loslaufen, eilen’ and primarily med. ‘sich ausstrecken’. The two forms of the med. pf. ví sasre 51 (here and X.71.4) belong to the latter root; see also Kü (553). The instr. sā́nunā I take as idiomatic for “on her back,” rather than expressing something like “along the back (of something else).” The other occurrence of the pf. ví sasre in X.71.4 contains an explicitly sexual image utó tvasmai tanvàm vísasre, jāyéva pátye uśatī́suvā́sāḥ “And for another she [=Speech] has stretched out her body, like an eager well-dressed wife to her husband,” and the same picture of feminine yielding is presumably meant here.

Re curiously takes pṛthú prátīkam as a “pre-compound” modifying Agni, but I follow Ge in taking it as an acc. construed with ádhi, a reference to the part of the earth on which the ritual fire is kindled.
