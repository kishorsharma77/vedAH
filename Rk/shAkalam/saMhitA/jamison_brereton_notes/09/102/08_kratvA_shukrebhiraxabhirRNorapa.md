As noted several times above, this is the first and only time that Soma is referred to in the 2nd ps. in this hymn, and only in the injunc, verb ṛnór ápa ‘you unclosed’. The switch in person is particularly noteworthy because this vs. forms a ring with vs. 1, sharing the pāda 1b, 8c—so the switch in person and the unity implied by the ring are, as it were, at odds with each other.

On ṛṇóti + ápa / ví see comm. ad I.58.3. In our passage Soma has been made the protagonist of the Vala myth (see Ober II.217).

In the publ. tr. I tr. the verb as a preterite, but I would now be inclined to render it as a general pres. (sim. to KH’s view, Injunk. 122), as a repeated ritual action performed by Soma reenacting the Vala myth.

On the 4-syl. afterthought pāda prā́dhvaré, which is found several times in Uṣṇih or its equivalent, see comm. ad VIII.12.31-33. I argue there that it is a truncated version of the fairly widespread loc. absol. prayaty àdhvaré “while the ceremony is pro(ceeding).” I would now change the tr. here to “… spurring the visionary power of truth while the ceremony is pro(ceeding).” Once again the final pāda is a semi-separable unit.
