This vs. presents us with a syntactic trap of sorts. It appears to consist of a standard REL / COREL construction, with 2a beginning yásya te and 2c beg. sá. And indeed the rel. and the sá are coreferential; however, the grammatical person has changed from 2nd to 3rd. I therefore prefer (contra Ge/Re) to attach 2ab to the previous vs., in which Soma is also 2nd ps. Pāda b acts as a transition from Soma as 2nd ps. to Soma as 3rd ps., with asyá referring to him, but the parallelism between the two “drinking” expressions keeps it within the syntactic domain of the rel. clause.

I have silently converted yásya into yád, since “upon drinking of which - of you --” is unparsable, or at least exceptionally awk., in English.

The gerund pītvā́in a is echoed by the i-stem loc. pītā́in b.

On the unexpected accent of supráketa-, as opposed to supraketá- (4x), see Old, who has no good explanation (nor do I).
