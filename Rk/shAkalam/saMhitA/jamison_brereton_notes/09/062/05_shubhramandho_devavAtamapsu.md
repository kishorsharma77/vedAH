The fluent Engl. of the tr. conceals a syntactic problem: soma should be the obj. of the verb svádanti in c, and the first pāda, which is entirely in the neuter, with the NP led by ándhas-, allows such an acc. interpr. However, the intermediate pāda (b) is stubbornly in the masc. nominative (dhūtáḥ … sutáḥ). We must either take b as a parenthetical nominal clause, as Ge and I do, or take ab as entirely in the nominative (as Re may do - his structure is not entirely clear) as a separate nominal clause, and supply a resumptive pronominal acc. for c.
