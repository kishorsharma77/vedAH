The expression mádāya ghṛ́ṣvaya in the Saṃhitā text may be deliberately ambiguous. The Pp. reads dat. ghṛ́ṣvaye, which is supported by IX.16.1 as well as VIII.64.12, but IX.101.8 has ... mádāya ghṛ́ṣvayaḥ “(cows) avid for exhilaration,” which would allow a tr. here “we, avid for exhilaration …” Although the publ. tr. follows the Pp.

(as do Ge and Re), I think both readings may be intended.
