Agni
Kata Vaiśvāmitra
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This is a hymn in praise of the fire as it gains strength. The first two verses look  forward to the fire’s blaze, which should be directed against the enemies of the  sacrificers. The third and middle verse turns to the ritual acts that cause the fire to  increase—adding fuel to it, offering melted butter into it, and even pouring praise upon it. The last two verses then again describe the blazing fire, but this time the  increasing blaze is not turned against enemies but rather represents and effects the  increasing strength and wealth of the sacrificers.
