Indra  
Parvata Kāṇva  
33 verses: uṣṇih, arranged in trcas. ̥  
R̥gveda VIII.12 is tightly structured: the meter is uṣṇih (8 8 12), and in each tr̥ca  the last four syllables of the final pāda form a refrain, which is, however, syntacti cally integrated into the verse. The last two tr̥cas before the final one (vss. 25–27,  28–30) expand the four-syllable refrain to full pāda length (that is, the final twelve  syllables), which retards the verbal progress and hints at the end to come. The long  refrain of verses 25–27, “just after that your two beloved fallow bays waxed strong,” echoes the short refrain of the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6), “you have waxed strong,” and  thus hints at a ring composition as well.  
The verb form shared by those two refrains (“waxed strong,” root vakṣ) is found  elsewhere in the hymn, as are synonyms (root vr̥dh:  “grow strong, make strong,  increase”) and near synonyms (“spread,” “swell”), and this verbal material pro vides the thematic spine of the hymn. Otherwise there is a mixture of mythological  material, especially toward the end, and invitations to and descriptions of the sac rifice. In the final tr̥ca (vss. 31–33) the poet announces the launch of his own hymn,  that is, the hymn to which this tr̥ca forms the end, and asks for the usual bounties  from Indra.
