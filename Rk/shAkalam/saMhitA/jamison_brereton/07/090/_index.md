Vāyu (1–4), Indra and Vāyu (5–7)  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
The split dedication to Vāyu, then Indra and Vāyu reflects the ritual fact noted  often elsewhere, that the first offerings of soma at the Morning Pressing are made  to Vāyu alone and then to Indra and Vāyu jointly. This ritual purpose is announced  quite clearly in the first verse, and, as often in Vāyu hymns, the invitation is followed  by the god’s journey to the sacrifice. As often also in Vāyu hymns the poet makes  productive use of the ambiguity between Vāyu’s “teams,” his wind-horses (see vs.  3), and ours, the poetic thought we deploy, and in verse 5 the priests and poets actu  
ally become the horses that pull the chariot of the two gods.  
As befits the early morning setting of the ritual, Dawn is prominent in the hymn  (vss. 3–4), with the latter verse alluding obliquely to the Vala myth associated with  the primal dawn. The distribution of gifts and goods appropriate to the early morn ing ritual is also prominent. In the early verses 2 and 3 there is promise of benefits  for the sacrificer from the gods, a promise that in the last two verses (6–7) is actually  fulfilled by the gifts made by the human patrons of the sacrifice. Indeed the patrons  seem to be partly assimilated to the gods: they have the power to confer not only  goods but sunlight itself (see vs. 6), and they share with the gods the repeated par ticiple īśāná “having dominion over,” said of Vāyu in verse 2, of Indra and Vāyu in  verse 5, and of the patrons in verse 6.
