All Gods  
R̥jiśvan Bhāradvāja  
15 verses: triṣṭubh  
Unlike the last hymn, with its tidy organization allotting one verse per god, this  All God hymn casts a wider and more inclusive net with multiple gods some times mixed in a single verse, some gods given more than one verse (Maruts, vss.  4–5), and marginally divinized figures, like the Waters (vs. 7), also addressed.  The first verse establishes this messy inclusiveness, calling on Aditi, the three  principal Ādityas (Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman), Agni, Savitar, Bhaga, and the  “rescuer gods,” who may, but need not be, the Maruts. The hymn also has a  more direct and intimate feel than VI.49: although both hymns mix 2nd-person  and 3rd-person reference to the gods, in VI.50 the 2nd person predominates, in  contrast to VI.49, and the 2nd-person invocations in VI.50 more often contain844 VI.50  
imperatives and requests in the optative, in contrast to the generally descriptive  clauses of VI.49.  
Another noteworthy feature is the relative prominence of female divinities.  Again, the first verse sets the scene by placing Aditi first. Besides Earth, in the  pair Heaven and Earth (vs. 3), we find Rodasī (vs. 5), the motherly Waters (vs. 7),  Sarasvatī (vs. 12), the Wives of the Gods, associated with Tvaṣṭar (vs. 13), and  Earth again (vss. 13–14). The divine ladies end the hymn (vs. 15).
