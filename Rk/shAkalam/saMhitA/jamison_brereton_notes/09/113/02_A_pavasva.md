Although in the idiom ā́pavasva the preverb ā́generally governs an acc., with the meaning “bring X through your purification,” here it seems identical in usage to the simplex.

On ārjīká- see comm. ad VIII.7.29. The appearance of śaryaṇā́vant- (vs. 1) and ārjīká- in two successive vss. recalls their appearance in the same vs. in VIII.7.29 (see also śaryaṇā́vant- in the preceding hymn VIII.6.39).

Note the appearance of both ṛtá- and satyá- in the phrase ṛtavākéna satyéna.

Contrary to Ge/Re, who take them as two parallel entities, I construe them as a single NP with satyá- as adj. The interpr. of Ge and Re may be supported by vs. 4, where ṛtá-, satyá-, and śraddhā́- are treated separately and in series, following the order in which they are found here. I therefore propose an alternative possible tr. here “With speech of truth, with what is real, with trust …”
