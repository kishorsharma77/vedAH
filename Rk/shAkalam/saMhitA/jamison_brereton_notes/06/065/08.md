In c, on the basis of VI.31.1 I would adjust the tr. to reflect the formulaic pair toká- tánaya- to “progeny and posterity, the waters, and the sun”; see also VI.25.4.

Flg. Ge, Re, and Klein (DGRV II.123, 194), the publ. tr. takes pā́rye … dyóḥ as referring to a particular, decisive time or hour of the day (Klein “in the last (hour) of the day”), but I now think it more likely that the phrase is simply a metrically driven variant of diví (...) pā́r i ye / pā́r i ye diví# “on the decisive day,” a locution found quite commonly in the VIth Maṇḍala (VI.17.14, 23.2, 33.5, 40.5; also pā́ri ye áhan VI.26.1). In pāda-final position that expression is only appropriate to Jagatī/dimeter cadences. Re makes a similar suggestion in his comm, despite his tr. “à l’heuredécisive du jour.” I would therefore slightly emend the publ. tr. to “on the decisive day”; sense supports this change: the act described in this pāda is more likely to be localized to a particularly important day, not a particularly important part of the day.

On the tendency of ádha to occur adjacent to locatives, see Klein DGRV II.95.
