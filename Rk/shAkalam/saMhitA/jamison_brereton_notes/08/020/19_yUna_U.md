As was pointed out in the publ. intro., pāda c contains a pun: the intens.

part. cárkṛṣat can belong straightforwardly to √kṛṣ ‘plough’, and in this reading the simile depicts a person engaged in ploughing singing or otherwise verbally encouraging his team, just as Sobhari sings to the Maruts. (In this case gā́ḥ would probably be better rendered “oxen.”) But it can also be secondarily associated with the root √kṝ ‘celebrate, praise’, which has a curiously formed 3rd sg. -se medial intensive cárkṛṣe (3x), beside act. carkar-/carkir-. For purposes of word play a nonce stem cárkṛṣ- could be extracted from the isolated cárkṛṣe. In this reading Sobhari is praising the Maruts like cows (see vs. 21); in other words this is a sort of reverse dānastuti. That the Maruts are called bulls in pāda b simply adds to the play.

Note also the phonological echo in gā́ya gā́(ḥ).
