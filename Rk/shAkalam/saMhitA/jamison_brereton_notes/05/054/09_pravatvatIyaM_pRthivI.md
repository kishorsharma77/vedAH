dyaúḥ is clearly fem. here, given the adj. pravátvatī, but this gender choice must be conditioned by its standard formulaic partner, fem. pṛthivī́, in the preceding pāda, modified by the same adj. in the same position.

The nom. pl. jīrádānavaḥ ‘having lively drops’ in d must modify the mountains (párvatāḥ), but in the immed. preceding hymn it is found in the voc. of the Maruts (V.53.6, in the same metrical pos.; cf. also I.34.4 a nom. pl. of the Maruts in the same position). There are no grounds for emending the text by deleting the accent and making it into a voc. (which would also entail a switch from 3rd to 2nd ps. ref.); how would it have acquired the accent here? Rather it must be word play: mountains produce torrents of water when it rains.
