Agni  
Virūpa Āṅgirasa  
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
Like the last hymn, this one, though apparently divided into tr̥cas, shows little  unity within the tr̥cas. Indeed, this hymn does appear to ramble, unlike the last  one, in which several persistent themes provided structure. There are several sig nature words, especially forms of the root śuc “flame, blaze” and of the nominal  vásu “good/goods.” Agni’s ritual function is the dominant topic, and his twin and  contrasting roles as vípra “inspired poet” (vss. 10, 12, 21, 29) and kaví “sage poet”  (vss. 7, 12, 21, 26, 30) are regularly mentioned. But there is no clear development  in the hymn, and most of the verses contain standard descriptions and addresses  to the god.
