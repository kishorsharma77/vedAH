The phrase pariṣkṛṇvánn ániṣkṛtam is not as much of an etymological figure as it first appears: in the 1st word, the preverb pari is cmpded with the s-mobile form of √kṛ, while the 2nd is the negated form of the somewhat enigmatic lexeme íṣ + √kṛ (the latter without s-mobile), on which see comm. ad VII.76.2. As disc. there, the pseudo-preverb íṣ may derive from the root noun íṣ- ‘refreshment’, and our passage here contains that noun.

The phrase yātáyann íṣaḥ “arranging refreshments” in b functions almost like a paraphrase, or repair, of the putative phrase íṣ- √kṛ “prepare refreshment” à “put in order, set to rights.”
