The referent of sīm in pāda a is not made clear, and the fact that sīm can stand for all genders and numbers doesn’t help. Given the racing theme of b (and in my interpretation c), I assume that it is our chariot, about which we have been worrying previously (vss. 4-6), though it could possibly be the dhī́- of the immediately preceding verse.

The lexeme apa-ā́√vṛj is attested only here, and the interpretation of the pāda is made more difficult by the noun to which it is applied, aratní-, lit. ‘elbow’, but potentially also ‘corner’ or ‘barrier’ (Schranken, see Old and Ge n.) or a unit of measure (like Engl. ell). I take it to be the body part (as does Ge tr.) and interpret it as a driving posture, with elbows turned out, indicating that the chariot racers are ready to start. For other suggestions see Ge n. and Old.
