I take gaṇé as referring to the troop of Maruts, as often, not an unidentified set of mortals making up a “(Sänger)schar,” as Ge seems to take it. Assuming that it refers to the Maruts, this provides conceptual ring composition with the final word of the hymn, marúdbhiḥ, as noted in the publ. intro.
