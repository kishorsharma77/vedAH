On prāśū́- see Scar (539-40) and vs. 2 above, as well as comm. ad VIII.31.6.

This verse is oddly couched as an impersonal. Ge’s interpretation of it is conventional: the humans have fulfilled their obligation (ṛṇám) to the god and he correspondingly fulfills his to them. But the curiously detached affect of the expression gives me pause, and the temporal relations between ab and c are backwards for this interpretation: nūnám ‘now’ situates the first two pādas temporally after the action of the third, whose verb is the perfect pape, and the perfect of √pā is generally preterital. I therefore interpret the verse quite differently from Ge. I take the debt to be Indra’s, what he owes to the human worshippers who praise and press soma for him. But he has preemptatively fulfilled it: his somadrinking is always accompanied by his gift. The reason for the indirect and impersonal expression is to avoid saying directly that Indra could owe a debt to humans. This interpretation requires taking the genitives in ab as quasi-datives, but this is quite common.

On apratā́see Old.
