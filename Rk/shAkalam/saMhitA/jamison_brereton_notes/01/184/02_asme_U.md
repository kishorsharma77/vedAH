The form éṣṭā is generally taken as the ppl. to √iṣ ‘wish, desire’ + ā́(so Ge [/WG], Re; e.g., Ge ‘herbeigewünscht’). This is not impossible, but it should be noted that √iṣ ‘desire’ is not otherwise attested with ā́in the RV. I prefer the interpr.

of Gr, fld. by Pirart (Les Nāsatya I: 385), which assigns it to √yaj ‘sacrifice’. The lexeme ā́√yaj is quite common and means ‘bring here/attract by sacrifice’, which fits the passage well.
