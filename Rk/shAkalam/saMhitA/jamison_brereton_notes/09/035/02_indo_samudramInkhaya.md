Two heavy cmpds in the voc., each with a 2nd member apparently derived from an - áya- trans./caus. governing the first member in the acc.: samudram-īṅkhaya ‘setting the sea to swaying’, viśvam-ejaya ‘setting all in motion’. Of course the final -m- of the 1st member also serves to break the hiatus between the vocalic stem-final of the 1st member and the vowel-initial verb stem. It’s also notable that verbal forms of ejaya- are not found in the RV; they first appear in KS (XI.6 [prose], XXXV.14 [mantra]). (My statement in the -áyamonograph, p. 108, that the first attestation is in ŚB is wrong, relying on the notation in Whitney’s Roots.)
