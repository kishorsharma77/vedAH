See the intro. for speculation about the social situation here. Pajra Sāman produces his own dānastuti in VIII.6.47, and our poet seems to be both denying any interest in Pajra’s windfall and declaring Pajra’s duty to compose his own thanks for it. See also Old’s extensive note on this passage.

The sequence vémi … ṛñjáse is reminiscent of VI.15.1 b … ṛñjase … / c véti.

In that passage because of the lack of accent ṛñjase must be a -se 1st sg. (and therefore with a diff. subject from véti).On ṛñjase see comm. ad IV.8.1. In the passage here the publ. tr. follows Gr’s interpr. of the form as an s-stem dat. inf. (so also, e.g., Ge). However it is possible that it is also a -se 1st sg., but accented because it opens a new clause: “I pursue you, Pūṣan; I aim (towards you).” On the other hand, and probably decisively, the parallel pāda b vémi stótave also has a dat. inf. as complement of vémi and so the infinitive reading should stand.
