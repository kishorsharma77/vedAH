Aśvins
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The first five verses of this hymn cover the familiar ground of Aśvin hymns—the  poet’s eager invitation to the two gods to drive to our sacrifice. Though the theme  and sentiments are familiar, there are a number of nice touches—the enjambment  across verse boundaries (1/2a; 2bcd/3a, at least in our opinion) and the play on the  concepts of newer and older in verses 4–5. This section ends (5d) with the phrase,  modifying the Aśvins, “providing bright gifts to the singer” (gr̥ṇaté citrárātī).
The following two verses (6–7) touch on several of the Aśvins’ famous deeds,  especially the rescue of Bhujyu from the sea (vs. 6), but the two verses after that  (8–9) take a detour, addressing other gods and urging them to take violent action  against various enemies. The poet seems so agitated that he loses his grip on gram
mar:  verse 9, concerning Mitra and Varuṇa, is syntactically fragmented, shift ing without warning or grammatical agreement between dual and singular and  between 3rd and 2nd person. (We have not been able to render the full effect in  English.)
Though verse 10 returns us to the Aśvins’ journey and to a more tranquil gram matical level, it too enlists the Aśvins to attack and also suggests that their journey  to us was prompted by the failure of other men. The final verse gives no hint of  the agitation in the immediately preceding verses and ends with the same phrase as  verse 5, thus implicitly indicating the bipartite structure of the hymn.
