The publ. tr. interpr. asmé as a dat. But the parallel in IV.10.8 śivā́naḥ sakhyā́sántu ... devéṣu yuṣmé, where the -mé pronominal form is anchored as a loc. by devéṣu, makes a loc. reading more likely. Cf. also VI.18.5 tán naḥ pratnáṃ sakhyám astu yuṣmé. I would therefore change the tr. to “Let there be friendly fellowship of you among [or, with] us.”
