The enclitic 2nd pl. vaḥ in pāda a must refer to the assemblage of ritual celebrants and its referent is not the same as the 2nd ps. ref. to the Maruts in the 2nd hemistich (voc. marutaḥ, impv. juṣadhvam, vocc. kavayo yuvānaḥ). As JL observed, pāda d has only one accented syllable (the first word etám).

The voc. phrase that ends it, kavayo yuvānaḥ, recurs in the final vs., 8c [=V.57.8c], but with voc. accent because it is in a string of such vocc.: kávayo yúvānaḥ. As noted ad V.57.8, that verse consists almost entirely of accented vocc., so the poet seems to be playing with extremes of syntactically driven accent here.
