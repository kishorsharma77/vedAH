Indra’s two actions in this vs. are expressed by injunctives (vivṛścát b, bādhata d), as in the preceding vs. (kaḥ 5d), but the middle verb, árcanti in c, is emphatically present. The configuration here, #árcantī́ndram marútaḥ, matches that of 1c #árcanti tvā marútaḥ. See Hoffmann (Injunk. 165) on this vs., who seems to think the “timeless, mentioning” function of the injunctive can be so distant from a real preterite that it can drag in present indicatives. I would attribute it rather to the attempt in this hymn to associate the heroic deeds of the past with the activities of the present sacrificers. It is also barely possible that the text originally read

*árcantíndram, that is, *árcant índram with the underlying 3rd pl. ending -nt
preserved before vowel, but later reint. as pres. -nti after -nt regularly became -nn.

The -í- could then have been lengthened, as if a sandhi product of árcanti índram, with no metrical consequences. The change would have been facilitated by the model of likewise pāda-initial árcanti in 1c, as well as arcanti in 12b. Still, on balance I find this unlikely. Other examples of preserved -nt because of early misparsing as -nti occur before the enclitic pronoun īm, and the result in either case would be -ntīm. See disc. ad I.67.4, etc.
