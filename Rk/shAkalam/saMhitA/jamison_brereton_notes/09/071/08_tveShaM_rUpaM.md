On the responsions between 8a and 2b and between 8d and 3c, see comm. ad locc.

On the basis of 9b, “the glittering form” seems to be appropriated from the sun.

The sequence of tense in b is somewhat troubling. The main cl. contains a pres. sédhati, which seems to express a general truth. The condition on this truth is expressed by the subordinate yátra cl., but we should then expect either a pres.

“when he lies down” or an aor. or pf. of the immed. past “when he has lain down” - as I in fact tr. ā́śayat -- but this is not a normal use of the imperfect.

Properly speaking we would expect the acc. pl. to be accented *srídhaḥ, as it normally is. Formally this should be an oblique sg., but that analysis simply doesn’t work in context.
