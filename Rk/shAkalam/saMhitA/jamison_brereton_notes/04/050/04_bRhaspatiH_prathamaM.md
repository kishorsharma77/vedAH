With Macdonell, I take mahó jyótiṣaḥ as a separate abl. phrase, rather than a gen. qualifying paramé vyòman with the standard interpr. Since we otherwise know little or nothing about Bṛhaspati’s birth, it is difficult to make an informed choice. I have gone with the abl. interpr. because the common phrase paramá- vyòman- does not seem to be qualified by a gen. phrase elsewhere (though this is not decisive) and because the contrast in this vs. between light and the darkness that Bṛhaspati blows away would be stronger if he were directly born from light.

As usual, numerology is difficult to interpr. I think Ge is correct that the seven in saptā́sya- ‘having seven mouths’ must be the Aṅgirases (see the same word in the next hymn, IV.51.4). What the seven reins (saptáraśmi-) are is more difficult.

Ge suggests the seven reins of the sacrifice; I prefer the seven seers, who are, in my opinion, the referents of the phrase saptá raśmáyaḥ in the enigmatic I.105.9 (see comm. ad loc.). This would provide Bṛhaspati with two different connections to poetic speech, appropriately enough.
