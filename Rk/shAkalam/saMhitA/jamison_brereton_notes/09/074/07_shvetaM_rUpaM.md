As just noted, yát síṣāsati is identical to yád … síṣāsati in 1b, and śvetáṃ rūpám “white form” seems the equivalent of svár ‘sun’, the obj. of síṣāsati in the earlier vs. - both referring to the milk mixture. It might be possible to take yád here as neut. rel. with rūpám and tr. “he makes for himself the/a white form that he is striving to win,” although I’m not sure that’s an improvement. In any case, I think the point is that Soma has attained the milk he was striving for.

Pāda b seems something of a non sequitur, and it may be that bhū́man-, which has a range of senses, should be tr. differently (Ge tr. Natur) - although in the preceding hymn, IX.73.5, in the phrase bhū́mano divás pári it clearly means ‘earth’.

Perhaps it contrasts with diváḥ in d and should be tr. “Soma … knows the earth” - the point being that the earthly Soma is fulfilling his ritual tasks, which will enable him to make contact with the heavenly soma and bring it as rain from heaven in d.

Note that this is the first time that the word sóma- appears in the hymn, and the only occurrence outside of the extra-hymnic vs. 9.

As just noted, sacate reprises the same verb in 1c and its equivalent participle in 5a sácamānaḥ. In both those cases soma was “keeping company” with a physical element of the ritual, namely water. Here the instr. express the human activity in the sacrifice: dhī́- ‘insight’, perhaps better here ‘insightful/visionary thought’ - that is the hymn - and śámī- ‘ritual labor’. This acknowledgement of the human contribution to the soma sacrifice is also found in the next vs.; otherwise it is absent from the hymn, except passingly and enigmatically noted in 4cd. Through most of the hymn Soma is presented as the only actor and agent of the ritual.

The problem in this pāda is pravát, which has received various analyses. See esp. the possibilities laid out by Old, as well as the nn. of Ge and Re. Of the choices, I prefer the nom. sg. Since the stem pravát- is fem. this requires reading sā́/ īm against Pp sáḥ / īm, but this actually improves the reading, since with the masc. prn.

we would expect sá īm in the Saṃhitā text (cf., e.g, IX.88.2). I take sém abhí pravát as a self-contained, almost parenthetical clause: it explains what precedes in the same pāda, namely that the hymns and physical ritual labor of the sacrificers are the way to approach Soma.

And this in turn will lead to his producing rain in d, by splitting open the cask of heaven. This “splitting” (áva darṣat) is perhaps thematically related to the “bursting” down from heaven (nā́bhaḥ … avó diváḥ) in 6c, if that’s what nā́bhmeans. It is difficult to render the áva in the lexeme áva darṣat, but áva is a Lieblingswort of this poet: see 1a, 4d, 6a, as well as aváḥ in 6c - all presumably in service of the “rain down from heaven” theme.
