In the first pāda the instr. juhvā̀can be read simultaneously as “with his tongue,” construed with réjamānaḥ and referring to the flame(s) of the fire, and as “by the offering-spoon,” construed with jajñe and indicating that the ghee poured from the spoon “begets” the fire by making it flame up.

The second pāda is likewise ambiguous and initiates the transition to the Indra-Aṅgiras-Vala myth portion of the hymn. The “sons of the great ruddy one” (mahás putrā́m̐aruṣásya) can be the flames of the fire, that is, of Agni himself -- and the infinitival prayákṣe ‘to display’ is esp. appropriate to this interpr. But they can also be, as they are identified by most commentators, the Aṅgirases, the sons of Heaven, who will figure in the Vala myth about to be related, but who are also associated with Agni, who is sometimes called áṅgirastama- (e.g., I.75.2; see Macd, Vedic Myth. 143). The “birth of these” (jātám eṣām) in c can likewise refer to both the flames and the Aṅgirases. Indra’s appearance in d strengthens the Aṅgiras reading and provides a transition to the next portion of the hymn.

The lexeme prá √yakṣ has been variously interpreted. For ‘display’ see Gotō (1st class, 153 and n. 572), EWA s.v. Curiously WG tr. it as if to √yaj ‘sacrifice’, despite Gotō’s own disc. just cited -- though the other possibility is suggested in the n.
