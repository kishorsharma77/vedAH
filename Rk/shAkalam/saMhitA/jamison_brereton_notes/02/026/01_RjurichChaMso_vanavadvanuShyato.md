With Ge, Re, and WG, I take ṛjúr íc cháṃsaḥ as a severed bahuvrīhi, like nárā ca śáṃsam (IX.96.42, cf. X.64.3), with accent and case ending adjusted. For a similar formation, still compounded, see V.44.5 ṛjugātha ‘o you whose song is straight on target’. It would be possible, however, to take the text as given and make a “straight laud” the subject, as a sort of metonymy; so Schmidt (B+I 115).
