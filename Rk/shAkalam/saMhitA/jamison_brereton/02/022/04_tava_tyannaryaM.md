This manly deed of yours, o dancing Indra, the foremost work done  by you, is to be proclaimed early in the dayâ€”
that by the power of a god you let life flow forward by letting the waters  flow.
He will overcome every godless one by his strength. He of a hundred  resolves will find nourishment; he will find refreshment.
