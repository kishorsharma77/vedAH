The opening of this vs., háriḥ sṛjānáḥ, echoes 1a … hárir ā́sṛjyámānaḥ#. I do not know if the root aor. part. here is meant to convey anterior value, as opposed to the pres. pass. part. in 1a, or if it’s just a variant.

For the infinitival use of the dative of this rt. noun cmpd pravā́c- see Scar (470).
