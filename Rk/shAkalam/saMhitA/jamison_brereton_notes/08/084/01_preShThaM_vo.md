I take védyam to √vid ‘find, acquire’ rather than √vid ‘know’, contra the standard view. I think it more likely that Vedic people (read, men) wanted to get a chariot rather than just know about it, and the renderings of the adj. show translators’ discomfort with the root assignment: Ge “wie ein Streitwagen denkwürdig,” Re “reconnaissable comme un char,” Klein (DGRV II.122) “conspicuous like a chariot.” None of these senses is really proper to √vid ‘know’. For the image, see II.2.3 and VIII.19.8.
