párā yāhi “drive away” comes awfully soon after 2a mā́párā gāḥ “don’t go away.” The genitive phrase vājíno rā́sabhasya is ambiguous: does it refer to two animals or one? Re opts for the former: “… du (cheval) gagnant-du-prix (et) de l’âne.” But the same phrase in I.34.9 makes it likely that the two words belong together as the designation of a single animal. So Ge (/WG).
