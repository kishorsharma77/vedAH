Āprī (1–12), Indra (13)  
Dīrghatamas Aucathya  
13 verses: anuṣṭubh  
Unlike Dīrghatamas’s dense and dexterous Agni hymns among which this hymn is  embedded, this Āprī hymn not only follows the set pattern of that genre, but, using  the standard Āprī diction and tropes (for which see the introduction to I.13, as well  as the general introduction, pp. 33, 63), does so without any perceptible tricks or  poetic exuberance. Its only deviation from the norm is having thirteen verses rather  than the usual eleven or twelve, by including both Tanūnapāt (vs. 2) and Narāśaṃsa  (vs. 3) and by having two svāhā verses at the end (12–13). Dīrghatamas (if he is  indeed the poet) seems to be treading water here.
