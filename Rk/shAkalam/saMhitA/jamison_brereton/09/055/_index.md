Soma Pavamāna  
Avatsāra Kāśyapa  
4 verses: gāyatrī  
The first three verses of the hymn are unified by a reference to the stalk (ándhas) of  the soma plant, although the role of the stalk is somewhat vague. Verse 1 is notable  for its mention of agriculture, though again the relevance is not entirely clear. The  martial Soma is on display in verse 4.
