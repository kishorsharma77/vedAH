Although the primary sense of d, “take delight in your praise,” is surely that the poets will enjoy praising Indra, in the context of these two verses it presumably also implies that they will take delight because their praise will put them (back?) into Indra’s good graces and thereby improve their own view of themselves and their chances of making good.
