Although in answer to the question in pāda a kúha sá “where is he,” we might expect naíṣó asti to mean “he is not (here),” I prefer the existential “he does not exist” of the publ. tr. for two reasons. In main clauses the pres. copula asti is almost always existential, and doubts about Indra’s existence are expressed elsewhere in the RV.
