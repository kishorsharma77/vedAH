Agni
Viśvasāman Ātreya
4 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 4
In verse 1 the poet Viśvasāman likely addresses himself. In doing so, he may be play ing on the significance of his name, which means “he to whom belongs every tune,”  for he calls on himself to chant to Agni. The fire is installed as the Hotar of the rite,  and like a Hotar he should be attentive. Therefore Viśvasāman asks that Agni be  attentive to his praise and to his words. The references to Agni as the “Hotar within  the clan” (vs. 1) and to the Atris (vs. 4) suggest that this short hymn was an address  to the clan fire of the Atris, and of course the fire of a clan of poets ought to be  especially attentive to the speech of poets and especially adorned by songs.
## 1
O Viśvasāman, like Atri chant forth to him of purifying flame,
who is to be invoked at the rites as the most delighting Hotar within  the clan.
## 2
Install Agni Jātavedas, the god and priest.
Let the sacrifice go forth in proper sequence today as that which best  encompasses the gods.
## 3
We mortals have brought to mind you of attentive mind, you a god, for help, begging for the help of you, the desirable one.
## 4
O Agni, be attentive to this (speech) of ours—here is our speech, o  strong one!
The Atris make you strong with their praise songs, o you of fair lips, o  lord of the household; the Atris beautify you with song.
