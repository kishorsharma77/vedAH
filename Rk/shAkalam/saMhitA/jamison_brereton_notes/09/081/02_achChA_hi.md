With Old I see “of gods” (devā́nām) in the phrase “the double birth of gods” as pregnant for “of gods (and men),” very much as a pregnant dual like dyā́vā “two heavens” or pitárā “two fathers” implies its opposite number. As Old points out, the locational adverbs in the next pāda amúta itáś ca “from yonder and from here” strongly suggest heaven and earth as their spheres. Ge considers “gods and men to be the sense, but, in order not to supply a 2nd gen. pl., he achieves this by way of the unlikely “(heavenly and earthly) gods,” that is, gods and men. Ober (I.391) thinks that the double birth is of Devas and Asuras, but this is anachronistic.
