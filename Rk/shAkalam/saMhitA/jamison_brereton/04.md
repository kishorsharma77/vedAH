The IVth Maṇḍala is the product of the Vāmadeva family, with almost all of  its fifty-eight hymns attributed to the eponymous clan poet himself, Vāmadeva  (Gautama). The numbers of Agni and Indra hymns are roughly equivalent (Agni  1–15; Indra 16–32), but the Indra hymns are the more striking, and Indra is really  the dominant god of the maṇḍala. The Indra sequence contains both the famous  treatment of Indra’s birth (IV.18), with dialogue between him and his mother while  he is still in the womb, and the almost equally famous hymn pair (IV.26–27) treating  the theft of soma from heaven—along with hymns lacking fame but repaying atten tion like IV.16 and 24. The important dialogue between Indra and Varuṇa (IV.42) is  also found in this maṇḍala, and Indra is addressed jointly with Varuṇa also in IV.41,  with Vāyu in 46–47, and with Br̥haspati in 49–50.
Moreover, a particular preoccupation in the Agni hymns is the Vala myth, which  is more properly an Indra (/Br̥haspati) narrative. Especially noteworthy in the Agni  cycle is IV.5, an enigmatic hymn meditating on the craft of poetry.
Maṇḍala IV also contains a sequence of five hymns dedicated to the R̥bhus (33– 37), the most sustained treatment of these gods in the R̥gveda and fundamental to  our understanding of their ritual and mythological nature. Other minor gods are  recessive in the maṇḍala, however.
The transcendent racehorse Dadhikrā is the recipient of three hymns (38–40).  The final two hymns, 57 and 58, are unique in the R̥gveda. The first is dedicated to  agricultural gods, a striking departure for a text that focuses on stock-breeding and  barely mentions agriculture, and the second celebrates the ritual substance ghee  (melted butter), a material offering fundamental to the ritual but meriting only one  hymn in the R̥gveda, as opposed to the many allotted to its parallel substance soma.

Vāmadeva Gautama
20 verses: triṣṭubh, except aṣṭi 1, atijagatī 2, dhrti 3 ̥
This long and complex hymn contains an important account of the Vala myth: the  opening of the cave containing the imprisoned cows and their release. Although the
556 IV.1
hero of this myth is, of course, ordinarily Indra, he does not appear in the hymn,  even in disguised fashion. Instead, the troop that usually aids him in this exploit,  the Aṅgirases, receive all the credit, though they are not mentioned by name. The  absence of Indra can presumably be ascribed to the fact that this is a hymn to Agni;  the larger question is why the Vala myth is appropriate to an Agni hymn. Here the  answer must be the connection of both gods with the dawn: the ruddy Vala cows are  regularly identified as the dawns, and the ritual fire is kindled at dawn. Indeed the  Vala myth in this hymn is introduced by a reference to Agni’s primordial birth (vs.  11), and the (unnamed) Aṅgirases are identified as his begetters (vs. 12): perhaps  they free the embryonic Agni enclosed “in the nest of the bull” (vss. 11–12) as they  do the Vala cows. We have seen the connection between the birth of the ritual fire  and the Vala myth elsewhere, for example, in III.31, an Indra hymn, where it was  also mediated by dawn.
The Vala myth is embedded within verses more conventionally devoted to Agni.  The first five verses address Agni directly. He is first reminded of his original instal lation by the gods and their purpose in so doing (vs. 1), and in the next four verses  Agni is urged to use his closeness to Varuṇa in order to intercede for us mortals  with that god. The next four verses praise Agni in the 3rd person, concentrating on  his present state. Verses 10–12 form the transition to the Vala myth; in fact verse  10 might seem to go naturally with 6–9, but, with its reference to the treasure of  the gods, it forms a ring with verse 18, which closes the Vala section. The heart of  the Vala narrative consists of verses 13–17. The final two verses (19–20) provide a  summarizing praise of Agni.
### 1
You, o Agni, the god, did the gods of equal fervor install for always as  the spoked wheel (of the sacrifice)—
with such a purpose did they install you:
[Gods addressing mortals:] “Sacrifice to the immortal [=Agni] among  the mortals; beget the god god-directed and discerning;
beget each one [=every new fire] as god-directed and discerning.”
### 2
Agni, turn here to your brother Varuṇa, to the gods with your favor—to  him who yearns for sacrifice,
your oldest (brother) who yearns for sacrifice,
the truthful son of Aditi who supports the settled domains, the king who  supports the settled domains.
### 3
O comrade, turn to your comrade, like a wheel to a swift (horse), like  chariotry at speed,
for us, o wondrous one, at speed.
Agni, you (will) find grace in company with Varuṇa, with the all-radiant  Maruts.
To press out progeny, o blazing one, make luck; for us, wondrous one,  make luck.
### 4
You, Agni, knowing one—for us may you please placate through prayer  the anger of god Varuṇa. As best sacrificer, best conveyor (of oblations), constantly blazing,
release all hatreds from us.
### 5
You, Agni, come down close to us with your help; be nearest to us at  the breaking of this dawn.
Through sacrifice placate Varuṇa for us, as you give to us. Pursue his  grace; be easy for us to invoke.
### 6
Of this well-portioned god here his manifestation is the fairest, the most  brilliant one among mortals.
Gleaming like the heated ghee of the inviolable (cow), (the
manifestation) of the god is eagerly sought like the largesse of a
milk-cow.
### 7
Three times do these highest births of his come into existence—the  eagerly sought births of the god Agni.
Enveloped within the limitless, he has come here—a blazing flame, ever  shining for the stranger.
### 8
As messenger he strives toward all seats, the Hotar whose chariot is  golden, whose tongue is amid the pleasures [=oblations],
whose horses are ruddy, he wondrous, far-radiant, always pleasurable  like a banquet abounding in food.
### 9
He makes men perceive [=instructs them], as their tie to the sacrifice of  Manu; they lead him forth with a great halter.
He dwells peacefully in his houses, assuring success; the god attains the  fellowship of the mortal.
### 10
Let Agni, knowing (the way), lead us to the treasure, which was  apportioned to him by the gods.
(The treasure) which all the immortals created with their insight, which  Father Heaven as begetter (created)—(that) they sprinkled (so it
became) real.
### 11
He was born first in the dwelling places, at the base of this great realm,  as his womb,
footless, headless, concealing his two ends, continually retracting (his  limbs [=flames]), in the nest of the bull.
### 12
The troop [=Aṅgirases] set forth first amid admiration to the womb of  truth, to the nest of the bull—
The eagerly sought youth, wondrous, far-radiant [=Agni]—the seven  dear ones [=Aṅgirases or their music] begat (him) for the bull.
### 13
Our forefathers here, belonging to Manu, stationed themselves in front,  panting over the truth.
They [=the forefathers/Aṅgirases] drove up those with a rock as their  pen, the good milkers within the cave, the ruddy dawns being
called to.
### 14
They [=the forefathers/Aṅgirases] cleaned themselves, after having split  the stone. This (deed) of theirs the others proclaimed all about.
558 IV.2
Lacking ropes to hold the livestock, they sang the decisive act: “They  found the light! They sought it with their insightful thoughts!”
### 15
Those with their mind set on cattle (opened up) the solid, knotted-up,  enclosing stone that held the cows.
The firmly fixed pen full of cows did the men, the fire-priests, open up  with divine speech.
### 16
They brought to mind the first name of the milk-cow; thrice seven  highest (names) of the mother they found.
(The cows) recognizing it [=the name], bellowed out (to the men), (like)  maidens (announcing their bridegroom choice). The ruddy one
[=Dawn] became manifest with the glorious (name) of the cow.
### 17
The bilious darkness disappeared; heaven lightened; the radiance of the  goddess Dawn arose.
The Sun mounted the lofty fields, looking upon the straight and the  crooked among mortals.
### 18
And then afterward having awakened they looked about; and then they  held up the treasure apportioned by heaven—
all the gods (did so) in all the houses. O Mitra, Varuṇa—let it
[=treasure] come into existence (also) for our insightful thought.
### 19
I would call here blazing Agni as Hotar, the best sacrificer who carries  all burdens.
He drilled, seemingly, the gleaming udder of the cows, which was
purified like the stalk of the plant poured in circles [=soma].
### 20
As the Aditi of all those worthy of the sacrifice [=gods], the guest of all  the sons of Manu [=men],
let Agni Jātavedas, choosing the aid of the gods, become very gracious.

2 (298) Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
20 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn shares a number of features, including phraseology, with the previous  one: like IV.1 it begins with the installation of Agni as the mediator of the sacri ficial exchange between men and gods, and it contains a brief, Indra-less account  of the Vala myth (vss. 15–17), with the Aṅgirases explicitly compared to the poets  of today besieging the treasure-holding pen of the sacrifice. However, the first few  verses of the hymn (vss. 2–4) enlarge on Agni’s role as messenger announced in  verse 1. The hymn also contains an elaborate treatment (vss. 6–10, 13–14) of the  various ritual services rendered to Agni by the sacrificers, and Agni is urged to dis tinguish between those who do such service and other mortals (esp. vss. 11–12). The  final two verses (19–20) summarize the fire-worship that has just been performed by the sacrificers, both actions (“we have performed,” vs. 19) and words (“we have  spoken,” vs. 20), a common hymn-ending device. Preceding them is a mysterious  verse (18), whose position suggests that it closes the Vala myth, but whose content  seems at least superficially unconnected.
### 1
He who has been installed as the immortal among the mortals, the god  among the gods, the truthful one, the spoked wheel (of the sacrifice), Hotar, best sacrificer—to blaze with his greatness, to be roused by the  oblations of Manu: Agni.
### 2
O son of strength, o Agni, created here for us today, between both  created (peoples [=men and gods])
you shuttle as messenger, o high one, having yoked your (horses) with  their testicles stretched out (behind from speed), (the horses) bullish  and blazing.
### 3
The two chestnut steeds of truth, strong(-backed), ghee-backed,
I consider to be swiftest (even in comparison) with mind.
Yoking these two ruddy ones, you shuttle between (all of) you gods and  the clans here, the mortals.
### 4
Among those (gods), convey Aryaman, Varuṇa, Mitra, Indra and Viṣṇu,  the Maruts, and the Aśvins
just here, to the person providing good oblations, o Agni—you who have  good horses, good chariot, good rewards.
### 5
O Agni, a sacrifice bringing cows, sheep, horses, and manly comrades is  never to be spurned.
Bringing refreshment and progeny, o Lord, it is long wealth, broad of  base, fit for the assembly.
### 6
Whoever will bear fuel to you though sweating, or will scorch his head in  serving you,
for him you will become a self-powerful protector, Agni. Make for him  wide protection from everyone who bears malice.
### 7
Whoever will bring food to you just as you seek food, will whet (you)  down, will raise (you) up as the gladdening guest,
will, seeking the gods, kindle (you) here in his dwelling—in him let
wealth, rich in gifts, be steadfast.
### 8
Whoever at evening, whoever at dawn will celebrate you, or offering an  oblation will make you a dear (friend)
in his own house—like a horse with much spurring you will carry that  pious man out of narrow straits.
### 9
Whoever will perform pious service for you, Agni, the immortal one,  whoever, with his offering ladle raised, will offer friendly service
to you,
that one, having labored to exhaustion, will not stay distant from wealth,  nor will the narrow straits of the malicious enclose him.
560 IV.2
### 10
Whose ceremony you will enjoy, Agni—a god enjoying the
well-positioned ceremony of a mortal, while you give—
just his ritual offering will be pleasing, o youngest one—(the man)  whose strengtheners we will be when he does (you) honor.
### 11
Insight and lack of insight will the knowing one [=Agni] distinguish,  like backs, straight and crooked, (like) mortals.
And for the sake of wealth and good descendants for us, o god, both  grant Diti [/Giving] and make wide space for Aditi [/Boundlessness]. 12. The poet [=Agni] have the undeceivable poets instructed, fixing him  down fast in the houses of Āyu.
From there, Agni, you should look with your eyes upon those who are  easily seen and upon the unerring ones (who go) along the ways of  the stranger.
### 13
You, Agni, offering good guidance, to the cantor, to the one with  pressed soma who does honor, o youngest one,
bring a treasure, broad and gleaming—to the one who labors to  exhaustion, to help him, o excitable one, you who fill the settled  domains.
### 14
Then while we [=sacrificing priests] have acted, with feet, with hands,  with bodies, in serving you, Agni,
like those making a chariot with the work of (our/their) two arms, those  of good insight [=poets] have held fast to the truth, panting over it. 15. Then as the seven inspired poets might we be born from mother Dawn,  as the foremost ritual adepts for men.
Might we become sons of heaven, Aṅgirases. Might we break the rock  that holds the prize, as we blaze.
### 16
Then like our further forefathers of old, panting over the truth, o Agni, those reciting solemn speech (now) will come to the blazing (udder of  sacrifice [=Vala]), to visionary power. Splitting (heaven and) earth,  they (will) unclose the ruddy (cows [=dawns]).
### 17
Those of good work and good light, seeking the gods, smelting the  races of the gods like metal,
they went blazing, strengthening Agni and Indra, besieging the  cattle pen.
### 18
He [=Agni?] watched over them like (a herdsman) the herds of livestock  in a cattle-rich (pasture)—watched over the race of gods that was  nearby, o strong one.
The Urvaśīs yearned also for (the race of) men, also for the increase of  the stranger, of Āyu to come.
### 19
We have acted for you; we have been good workers—(as) the radiant  dawns have clothed themselves in truth—
we always grooming in many ways unfailing Agni, beautifully gleaming,  the dear eye of the god. 20. These solemn speeches have we spoken to you the poet, o Agni, you  ritual adept: enjoy them.
Blaze up; make us better off. Extend to us great riches, o you of many  favors.

3 (299) Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
16 verses: triṣṭubh
In the very last verse of this hymn (16) the poet announces that he has produced  counsels, enigmas, secret words, and poetry for Agni: these verbal products presum ably make up the rest of the hymn. It begins fairly straightforwardly, however, with  a treatment (vss. 1–3) of the kindling of the ritual fire, as so often at the beginning  of Agni hymns. But starting with verse 4 a certain worried tone becomes apparent,  about the relationship between the poet and the god Agni. The next four verses  (5–8) contain anxious questions: what is Agni planning to say to various gods about  us? These questions reflect the uncertainty produced by the ritual model: Agni is the  ritual mediator between men and gods, and so in some sense everything the gods  learn about us mortals is filtered through Agni, who may be—we worry—an unreli
able witness. The anxiety returns in verses 13–14, especially the former, in which the  poet worries that Agni will punish him for the deeds of his relatives and acquain tances. In between (vss. 9–12) are four verses, each beginning with the charged word  r̥téna “by truth,” introducing a mixture of ritual and mythic activities, including
one verse (11) on the Vala myth, a preoccupation of the Agni hymns in IV. What ties the various parts of the hymn together is not entirely clear, and it  may be that the poet’s final verse, listing several types of verbal material, is meant  to indicate that the hymn consists of a disparate collection of his works, although  attempting to assign those labels to the different parts of the hymn would probably  be taking the conceit too far.
### 1
Make [=ignite] him here, the king, the Rudra of your ceremony, the  Hotar whose sacrifice comes true in the two world-halves,
Agni of golden form—(make him) for help for you in the face of
unexpected thundering.
### 2
Here is the womb that we made for you. (It is/You are) like an eager wife,  richly dressed, for her husband.
Enveloped, sit down facing our way: here are (hymns) facing you, o very  knowing one.
### 3
To him [=Agni] who listens undistracted to the thought, to the one  drawing the gaze of men, the very gracious one—o ritual adept—
to the god, the immortal, chant the chant, the god whom the (human)  presser invokes like the honey-pressing pressing stone.
562 IV.3
### 4
Agni, at least become aware of this (ritual) labor of ours, of (our  expression of) truth, o perceiver of truth, as one who is very
concerned.
When will our solemn words become your feasting companions? When  will your fellowship (come to) be in our house?
### 5
How will you complain about this to Varuṇa, o Agni, how to Heaven?  What is our offense?
How will you speak to Mitra the rewarder, to Earth? What to
Aryaman, to Fortune?
### 6
What (will you say), Agni, having grown strong on the holy places  [=ritual hearths], what to the Wind projecting strength, charging to  beauty,
(what) to the earth-circling (chariot) of the Nāsatyas, for it to appear?  What will you say, Agni, to man-smiting Rudra?
### 7
How (will you speak) to great Pūṣan who brings prosperity, what to  Rudra, the good combatant [/very generous], for him to give the  oblation,
what to wide-striding Viṣṇu, (for him to give) semen? What will you say,  Agni, to (Rudra’s) lofty arrow?
### 8
How (will you speak) to the troop of Maruts, for truth? How to the  lofty Sun? When you are asked,
(how) will you answer to Aditi, to powerful (Indra?)? Send (our  thought) to its goal, all the way to heaven—(you are) the observant  one, o Jātavedas.
### 9
With truth I reverently invoke the (mystical) truth set down [=acquired]  from the cow: the raw one [=cow] and the cooked, honeyed (milk)  belong together, Agni.
Though she is black, she is swollen with the gleaming gush, with milk  for nourishing offspring.
### 10
Because by truth even the bull, the male Agni, was anointed with the  milk on the top [=cream, that is, butter],
not bucking, he went about conferring vigor: the bull as Pr̥śni milked  gleaming (milk/semen) from his udder.
### 11
By truth they threw open the rock, having split it. The Aṅgirases roared  along with the cows.
For blessing the men besieged the dawn; the sun became visible when  the fire was born.
### 12
By truth the immortal, unharmable goddesses, the waters with their  honeyed floods, o Agni—
like a competitor beating a tattoo at the start(ing posts)—should set to  running, to stream forever.
### 13
Don’t ever chase after (us, as) the specter of a nobody, a crooked man— neither of a tricky neighbor, nor of a friend. Do not pursue the debt of a dishonest brother (against us), Agni. May  we not pay for the “skill” of a cheating partner.
### 14
Guard us, Agni, with your guards, ever guarding when you are gratified,  you good combatant [/very generous].
Spring toward rigid constraint and break it apart; smash demonic force,  even though it has grown great.
### 15
By reason of these recitations become well disposed, Agni; by reason of  our thoughts caress these prizes, o champion.
And enjoy the sacred formulations, Aṅgiras. May the chant favored by  the gods bring harmony to you.
### 16
All these devices, the secret words, are for you who know, o ritual  adept, Agni—
the enigmas, the poetic compositions are for you, the wise poet. I, the  inspired one, have pronounced them in composed thoughts and
solemn speeches.

4 (300) Agni the Demon-Smasher
Vāmadeva Gautama
15 verses: triṣṭubh
The Anukramaṇī names Agni Demon-Smasher (Rakṣo-han) as the divinity of this  hymn. This ascription is certainly apt for the first five verses with their vividly hos tile imagery, but starting with verse 6 the benefits that accrue to those who properly  worship Agni are described (vss. 6–10). We identify ourselves as those worshipers  in verses 8–9, and in verse 11 (see also vs. 8) the poet boasts of his hereditary poetic  gifts, which enable him to get the attention and good favor of Agni. He explicitly  identifies the source of his poetic skill as his father Gotama, but implicitly, through  his phraseology, he also identifies himself with the Aṅgirases, the legendary poets  who broke open the treasure cave of Vala, a myth that is much on the mind of the  poet of these Agni hymns in IV (see, e.g., IV.1.13–17; 2.15–17; 3.11). The remaining  verses (12–15) call on Agni to protect us with his protectors (presumably his flames)  and to grant other blessings. The demons return in the last half verse (15cd).
### 1
Make your leading edge like a broad onslaught. Drive like an aggressive  king with his entourage,
mowing down (enemies) along your thirsting onslaught. You are an  archer: pierce the demons with your hottest (flames).
### 2
Your swirling (flames) fly swiftly; touch down boldly following (them  [/your onslaught]) as you keep blazing.
Unfettered, o Agni, with your tongue hurl out bursts of heat, flying  (embers), firebrands in all directions.564 IV.4
### 3
Hurl out your spies against (the foes), as the swiftest one. Become the  undeceivable protector of this clan here.
Whoever curses us at a distance, who nearby, o Agni, let no one defy  your veering course.
### 4
Stand up, Agni; stretch yourself out [/stretch (your bow)] against  (them). Then scorch down the foes, o you whose missiles are sharp. Whoever has directed hostility toward us, o kindled one, burn him  down like a dry thicket.
### 5
Become upright; pierce against (them)—away from us. Make your  heavenly (forms?) manifest, Agni.
Slacken the taut (bows) of those incited by sorcerers; kin or non-kin,  pulverize the rivals.
### 6
That one knows your good will, o youngest one, who has set the course  for a sacred formulation like this.
For him you have flashed open the doors to all the day-bright (days), to  the riches, to the brilliant things of the stranger.
### 7
Agni, let just him be rich in portions, rich in gifts, who with regular  oblation, who with solemn words
seeks to please you during his own lifetime, in his own dwelling. All  (days) (will be) day-bright for him. This desire (of his) will come true. 8. I recite a good thought to you [/recite (=praise) your good will]. Hear  it, inclined our way. (Like) a “Favorite” wife, let this song bring  harmony to you.
We who have good horses and good chariots would groom you. In us  you should uphold lordly powers through the days.
### 9
Here should (a man) attend on you much in person—you illuminator of  the evening, shining through the days.
Playful and well disposed, we would serve you, we who have
surmounted the brilliant things of (other) men.
### 10
Whoever, rich in horses and gold, drives up to you, Agni, with a chariot  full of goods,
his protector do you become and the (ritual) partner of him who will  regularly enjoy your guest-friendship.
### 11
Thanks to my lineage, I powerfully break (it [=the rock full of  treasures]) with my speeches. This [=speech/poetic gift?] has come  down to me from my father Gotama.
Take note of this speech of ours here, o Hotar, youngest one, very  effective, as friend of the house.
### 12
These—sleepless, (ever) advancing, very friendly, tireless, never  wearying, keeping the wolf away—
these protectors of yours, directed to a single goal—let them settle  down and protect us, o ungullible Agni. 13. Agni, your protectors who, watching, guarded blind Māmateya  [=Dīrghatamas] from ill-faring,
those of good (ritual) action has the possessor [/knower] of everything  [=Agni] guarded. Though wishing to damage, the cheats did no
damage at all.
### 14
Through you may we—companions aided by you, in your guidance— attain prizes.
Sweeten both of the lauds [=for both the gods and the patrons], you  who are reality itself. Set them in order, you unabashed one.
### 15
With this kindling stick we would do honor to you, Agni. Accept the  praise being chanted.
Burn the demons who lack chant; protect us from deceit, from scorn,  from calumny, o you with Mitra’s might.

5 (301) Agni Belonging to All Men [Agni Vaiśvānara]
Vāmadeva Gautama
15 verses: triṣṭubh
A very difficult and enigmatic hymn: this is not surprising because its subject seems  to be poetic speech, its hidden meanings and its mysterious sources, so that the  form of the hymn replicates its theme. The signature word is padám, which occurs  six times in the hymn (vss. 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 12); it is a significant pun, meaning both  “track/footstep” and “word,” and in the full phrase “hidden track of the cow”  (padám...gór ápagūḷham, vs. 3) it refers to the arduous pursuit of cryptic meaning  by way of verbal art. As often when R̥gvedic poets reflect on their craft, this poet  wonders about the source of his own poetic inspiration and worries about the skills  of other poets. Although some scholars consider this hymn to reflect a poetic con test, we do not see a formal contest here, but simply the usual anxiety about poetic  rivals. This poet identifies the source of his poetic gift as the god Agni (vss. 2–3, also  12), who bestowed this vision on him, though he was just a simple man (vss. 2, 6).  He puzzles over the fact that thoroughly evil men can nonetheless also have the gift  of poetry (vss. 4–5), but decides that because he (the poet) is morally uncompro
mised, Agni will shoulder the extra burden of bringing his (the poet’s) poetic vision  to success (vs. 6). When he returns to the rival poets in verse 14, he is full of scorn  for their talent: the patronage of Agni has clearly spelled the difference for our poet.
The exact middle of the hymn (vss. 7–8, esp. 7cd) is an omphalos, which dis plays in daunting fashion the control the poet has gained, thanks to Agni, over the  encrypted mysteries of the sacrifice and its verbal expression. Verse 7 ends with  the impossible hapax jábāru. There have been various attempts to interpret and  etymologize this word, beginning with Yāska, but in our opinion this is beside the  point: the word is a sort of abracadabra, a mystical expression, and the half verse
566 IV.5
in which it appears encapsulates the profound and transformative secret of the sac rifice. This secret is under the protection of Agni in verse 8, but the poet has learned  at least some of it.
The following two verses (9–10) reflect on the dawn ritual and the kindling of the  sacrificial fire then, though the mysteries are rather easier to penetrate than those in  the omphalos verses. The poet then expresses hope for gifts from Agni in exchange  for his own formulation of the truth (vs. 11) and asks somewhat nervous questions  about how and whether he will gain these gifts (vss. 12–13). As already noted, verse  14 heaps scorn on rival poets with fewer verbal skills. The final verse is conventional  praise of Agni, expressed in the aorist of the immediate past, indicating that the  morning ritual and the hymn have come to an end.
Another Vaiśvānara hymn, VI.9, follows much the same trajectory as this one,  with similar reflections on the craft of poetry and the inspiration received from Agni.
### 1
How might we, in concert, do service to Vaiśvānara, to Agni who gives  rewards; how might we serve his lofty light?
With his unfailing lofty growth he propped (heaven) like a post a bulwark. 2. Do not spurn (him), the self-empowered god who gave this bounty to me,  a mortal,
a simple man—he shrewd, discriminating, the immortal Vaiśvānara,  most manly, youthfully exuberant Agni.
### 3
A great melody (he gave)—the doubly lofty, sharp-pointed,
thousand-spurting, powerful bull—
having found the word hidden like the track of the cow. Agni has
proclaimed the inspired thought to me.
### 4
Agni, the sharp-fanged, will snap at them with his hottest flame—he who  (also) grants good rewards—
at them who violate the ordinances of Varuṇa, the enduring ordinances  dear to Mitra who attends to them.
### 5
(You) pursuing (it [=the hidden word/track]) like brotherless maidens  pursuing (men), (you) of evil ways like wives cheating (on?) their husbands, though being wicked, untruthful, untrue, you [=other singers] begot this  deep track [/profound word].
### 6
(But) this (track/word) is mine, o pure Agni! Since I, however small,  do not violate (the ordinances), for me you have boldly placed the
thought, like a heavy burden,
lofty and deep, on your own youthfully exuberant, sevenfold “back”  along with the pleasurable offering.

May my hymnic vision, purifying through its conception, reach just to him  [=Agni?] now, to the same one in the same way (as always [at the ritual]). On the hide of the grain [=ritual grass?] is the lovely (udder/name)
of Pr̥śni [=sacrifice]; on the tip of the mount has (the mystical
expression? the milk?) “jabāru” (also? been) mounted. 8. What (part) of this speech is to be proclaimed to me? They confide  privately what was deposited in secret [=the track/word]—
that they have uncovered it like the “water” of the ruddy (cows). He  [=Agni] protects the dear tip of the mount, the track of the bird.
### 9
Here is this great face of the great ones [=Sun], which the ruddy cow  [=Dawn] followed (as it went) in front.
She [?] found it shining hidden in the track of truth, going quickly,
quick-streaming.
### 10
Then having flashed with his mouth, in company with his parents  [=kindling sticks], he [=Agni] pondered the hidden, dear (udder/
name) of Pr̥śni,
(the udder/name) which is in the furthest track/footstep of the mother  cow, though (also just) nearby—(Agni having flashed) with the
tongue of his bullish, extended flame.
### 11
I have proclaimed the truth with reverence, on being asked, with hope  of you [=your bounty], Jātavedas, if it [=the truth] is here.
You hold sway over this, all of it—whatever wealth is in heaven and  what on the earth.
### 12
Is some of this wealth for us? What is the treasure? As the perceptive  one, Jātavedas, you have announced to us
in secret the highest (track/footstep) of this (ritual) road of ours, on  which we have gone, like the spurned going on an empty track.
### 13
What is the (finish) line, (what) the trajectories, what the desired  (wealth)? Might we go to it, like quick (horses) to a prize.
When will the goddesses, the wives of the immortal one, the Dawns  stretch toward us with the color of the sun?
### 14
Those who fail to satisfy with their insipid, meager, stunted speech, easy  to attack—
what then do they say here, Agni? Without weapons, let them be
accompanied by (speech) that does not come true.
### 15
Of him, being kindled for beauty, the bull, the good one—his face  shines here in the house.
Gleamingly clad, with a form lovely to see, he of many favors has
flashed like a dwelling (flashing) with wealth.

Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is not at the same level of complexity as the previous Agni hymns in  Maṇḍala IV; it does, however, contain some difficult hapaxes (see vss. 7, 8, 10) in
568 IV.6
its second half. The hymn in quite ritually focused, particularly in its first half (vss.  1–5). The mention of the post (vs. 3) and Agni’s circumambulation (vss. 3–5) identi fies the ritual in question in these verses, an animal sacrifice: as we know from later  detailed accounts of the ritual, the animals were tethered to the post before sacri
fice, and fire was carried around them. See III.8, dedicated to the sacrificial post. The subject of the second half is less clear, the ritual references both less precise  and more poetically enigmatic. It is perhaps simply the kindling of fire at dawn,  as so often, with striking and shifting descriptions of its birth and of its resulting  flames. The most difficult part of the hymn is the first half of verse 7, and its trans lation here is speculative.
Although the hymn seems to fall into two halves, there is no reason to suppose  that it is not a unitary composition. The exact ritual references of the first part  simply open out to a general treatment of the ritual fire, by way of a transition (vss.  5–6) mentioning the fearsome aspects of Agni, perhaps suggested by the associa
tion with animal sacrifice.
### 1
Stand upright, o Agni, Hotar of the ceremony, as superior sacrificer for  us at the divine assemblage.
Since you dominate every thought, you further the inspiration even of  the ritual adept.
### 2
As ungullible Hotar he has been set among the clans, Agni, gladdening,  forethoughtful at the rites of distribution.
Like Savitar he has braced his radiant beam upright; like a builder he  propped his smoke up to heaven.
### 3
The (offering ladle) is held out, beautifully glowing, full of gifts,
covered with ghee. (Agni), chosen (as Hotar), is making respectful
circumambulation before the divine assemblage.
The post (standing) up, like a new-born foal [?], anoints the (sacrificial)  animals—itself well placed, well grounded.
### 4
Once the ritual grass has been strewn and the fire kindled, the Adhvaryu  has stood upright, in delight.
Like a cowherd Agni circles around (the sacrificial animals) with triple  toil—he chosen as Hotar from of old.
### 5
With measured pace the Hotar goes around by himself—Agni,
gladdening, of honeyed speech, truthful.
His flames run like prizewinners. All creatures fear (him) when he has  flashed.
### 6
Auspicious is your manifestation, o Agni of the lovely face, and it is dear,  though you are terrible and capricious.
Since they have not covered your flame with darkness, the palls of smoke  have not placed their smudge on your body—
### 7
This (body) of (him) the devourer [/fire], which has not been obstructed  from birth, nor have his mother and father ever (been obstructed) in  their seeking (for him)— therefore, well installed like an envoy, pure Agni shines among the clans  stemming from Manu.
### 8
Agni, whom the twice five sisters dwelling together [/similarly clad]  [=fingers] have begotten among the clans stemming from Manu—
awakening at dawn, gleaming like the tooth of one enveloped in flame,  with a good mouth, sharp like an axe.
### 9
These golden (horses) of yours, Agni, bathed in ghee, the chestnuts  directed straight, directed well,
the ruddy, bullish ones with testicles stretched out (behind
from speed)—these wondrous ones have “called” the divine
assemblage here—
### 10
These rays of yours, Agni, which proceed, overwhelming, irrepressible,  turbulent,
are like falcons going the distance to the goal, very noisy like the
Marutian troop.
### 11
A sacred formulation has been made for you, o kindled one. (The  priest) will recite the solemn speech to (you as you) sacrifice. (Now
you—) apportion (treasures).
The fire-priests have set down Agni as the Hotar of Manu, giving
homage to (him as) “Laud of Āyu.”

7 (303) Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: jagatī 1, anuṣṭubh 2–6, triṣṭubh 7–11
Although this hymn consists of verses in three different meters, it was clearly con ceived as a unity, as was already seen by Oldenberg (1888: 153). The hymn begins,  as often, with the ritual installation of the current sacrificial fire, which is set against  the backdrop of the primal installation of Agni, treated in verses 1–5, in a non insistent ring structure. Verses 6 and 7, though in different meters, express the cen tral mysteries of Agni and therefore define a sort of omphalos. Verse 6 is structured  as a series of paradoxes concerning the nature of fire. Verse 7, quite reminiscent of  the omphalos verse IV.5.7, refers to the elements of the sacrifice in riddling fashion.  The hymn then turns to Agni’s role as messenger between Earth and Heaven (vss.  8–9, 11, first mentioned in vs. 3), with some vivid metaphorical description of fire’s  appearance and its consuming of flammable “food” (vss. 9–11).
### 1
This one has been installed here first by the installers, as best sacrificing  Hotar, to be reverently invoked in the ceremonies,
whom Apnavāna and the Bhr̥gus made to shine, brilliant in the woods,  extending to every clan.
570 IV.7
### 2
Agni, when will there be manifestation of you, the god, in the  regular order?
For it was therefore that the mortals seized you as the one to be  reverently invoked in the clans—
### 3
(The mortals) looking at (you,) truthful and discriminating (/widely  observable) like heaven with its stars,
(you) who create laughter [=fire’s crackling] for all ceremonies in  every house,
### 4
(You,) the swift messenger of Vivasvant, who sur(mount) all the  domains,
the Āyus brought (you) here as beacon, associated with the Bhr̥gus, for  every clan.
### 5
Him as observant Hotar did they set down in the regular order— gladdening, pure-flamed, best sacrificing, throughout his seven
domains—
### 6
Him, enveloped in mothers who are ever new, enveloped in wood (yet)  unfixed,
set in hiding though brilliant, easily found but aiming who
knows where.
### 7
When, at the separation of the grain [=spreading of the ritual grass?], at  the same udder [=the sacrifice?], on the domain of truth [=the ritual  ground?], the gods take pleasure,
great Agni, on whom the oblation is bestowed with reverence, the  truthful one, is always pursuing (his missions) for the ceremony. 8. You, as the knowing one, pursue your missions for the ceremony  between the two world-halves, observing them both together.
You speed as the messenger chosen from of old, since you know better  the means of ascending to heaven.
### 9
Black is your course, (though) you are gleaming; your light is in front.  The flickering beam of your (various) wondrous forms is single
when (your mothers, though) not impregnated, conceive an embryo,  and you, even immediately at birth, become a messenger.
### 10
Immediately at birth, his strength comes to light, when the wind fans  his flame.
He twists his sharp tongue into the thickets. Even hard foods he  fragments with his jaws.
### 11
When thirstily he has grown with (his flame) thirsting for food,  he makes the thirsty (flame) into his messenger—youthfully
exuberant Agni.
He accompanies the roaring of the wind as he grinds down (the bush);  he incites it like a swift (horse); the steed is impelled.

Vāmadeva Gautama
8 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn shares some phraseology and themes with the immediately preceding  IV.7, especially Agni’s role as messenger, but it is far less complex than that hymn.  It is also unlike that hymn in its prayers for rich goods from Agni in exchange for  ritual service.
### 1
Your messenger, affording all possessions, immortal oblation-bearer, best sacrificer—I will aim straight toward him with a hymn.
### 2
For he knows the depository of goods; the great one knows the means of  ascending to heaven.
He will convey the gods hither.
### 3
He, the god, knows how to bow the gods here to the house for him who  acts with truth.
He will give especially dear goods.
### 4
He is Hotar, and he, understanding his mission, speeds between (heaven  and earth),
knowing the means of ascending to heaven.
### 5
May we, who have done pious service for Agni by giving oblations,  be those
who, thriving, kindle him.
### 6
They become far famed as winners through their wealth, they through  their masses of heroes,
who have placed their friendship in Agni.
### 7
On us may the riches craved by many converge day after day;
to us may prizes move.
### 8
He, the inspired poet of the settled domains, of the sons of Manu, by his  vast power
pierces through (obstacles) as if with the snap (of a bow [string]).

8 verses: gāyatrī
Like II.1 and II.11, this short hymn enumerates Agni’s ritual roles by identifying  him with various priests, but it is considerably simpler and more straightforward  than either of those two hymns. The order of the priestly offices here is close to that  found in II.1.
572 IV.10
### 1
Agni, be gracious. You are great—you who have come here to the  god-seeking people,
to sit on the ritual grass.
### 2
He, the immortal difficult to deceive, pursuing (his ritual duties) among  the clans stemming from Manu,
has become messenger for all.
### 3
He is led around his seat as the Hotar, gladdening at the rituals of  day(break),
and he sits down as the Potar.
### 4
And Agni (leads) the Wives (of the Gods) at the ceremony [=Neṣṭar],  and he is Houselord in the home,
and he sits down as the Brahman.
### 5
You pursue (your ritual duty) as Upavaktar for the people who perform  the ceremony,
and you pursue the oblations of the sons of Manu.
### 6
And you also pursue the (ritual) mission of him whose ceremony you  will enjoy—
to convey the oblation of the mortal.
### 7
Our ceremony enjoy, our sacrifice, o Aṅgiras;
hear our call.

Let your chariot, difficult to trick, encircle us on all sides,
the chariot by which you guard the pious.

10 (306) Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
8 verses: padapaṅkti, except mahāpadapaṅkti 5
This uncomplicated hymn begins with the sacrificial here-and-now and the poet’s  hope for the success of the sacrifice currently being performed. He then praises  Agni’s participation in the sacrifice, his brilliant appearance, and his protection of  his mortal worshiper, ending with a prayer for good partnership with the gods and  a strong statement of the umbilical tie between gods and men, as mediated through  the sacrificial Agni. The image of the sacrifice as the shared udder of gods and men  is also found in nearby Agni hymns: IV.7.7 and by implication IV.5.7.
Although the content of the hymn is straightforward, the meter is quite unusual,  indeed confined to this one hymn (see Oldenberg 1888: 98; Arnold 1905: 239–40).  It is thus not surprising that the Anukramaṇī’s characterization of it, reproduced  in the heading above, is not illuminating and is in fact somewhat misleading. Each  verse consists of a series of five-syllable pādas (three per verse, except for vs. 5  containing four) followed by a single triṣṭubh pāda. The short pentads tend to pres
ent abbreviated syntactic constituents, such as similes or tightly organized noun phrases, while the culminating triṣṭubh provides the frame into which the earlier  mosaic pieces can be fitted. However, as the hymn progresses, the group of pen tad pādas begins to operate independently of the triṣṭubh finale. In this hymn the  medium is in many ways the message.
### 1
Agni, this (sacrifice) today may we bring to success with lauds of you— like a horse with praises,
like a good resolve—(so that it) touches your heart.
### 2
For, Agni, it is therefore that you have become the charioteer of good  resolve,
of skill that brings success, of lofty truth.
### 3
By reason of these recitations of ours become inclined our way like  sunlight,
well disposed with all your faces, o Agni.
### 4
Singing with these songs, we would do pious service for you today,  o Agni.
Your gusts thunder forth like (those) of heaven.
### 5
Your manifestation is the sweetest, Agni—now by day, now by night. For beauty it shines like a gold ornament in the nearness.
### 6
Like purified ghee your body is spotless gleaming gold.
This (flame?) of yours shines like a gold ornament, autonomous one. 7. Because, o Agni, even a hateful act already committed you drive away,  bag and baggage,
from the mortal who sacrifices just so, o truthful one,
### 8
Let our comradeship be propitious, our brotherhood, o Agni, (with  respect) to you gods.
This navel [=Agni/sacrifice] of ours is in the same seat, at the same udder  (with you).

11 (307) Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
6 verses: triṣṭubh
This short hymn begins with a verse full of phonetic and morphological play. The  middle two verses (3–4) contain seven repetitions of tvád “from you,” all but one  stationed at the beginning of the pāda. Verse 5 begins with tvā́m, “you” in a differ ent case, to bring that sequence to a close. Verse 5 also deploys playful oppositions
of gods and mortals, and the final verse is marked by alliterative sequences. The hymn identifies Agni as the source of both material goods (vss. 3–4) and  of poetic inspiration (vss. 2–3), and the highly wrought surface of this superficially  simple hymn shows that the poet has put the latter gift to good use.574 IV.12
### 1
Auspicious is your face, mighty Agni; it shines here in nearness to the Sun. Gleaming to be seen, it is seen even by night. Not coarse is the food
[=ghee] to be seen on its form.
### 2
Unloose inspiration for the singer (as if) through an aperture, o
powerfully born Agni, in your excitation while you are being praised. What you, along with all the gods, will crave, that grant us, o brilliant,  very great one—an ample thought.
### 3
From you, Agni, poetic compositions, from you inspired thoughts, from  you are born solemn words to be realized.
From you come chattels ornamented with heroes for the pious mortal  whose thought is to the point.
### 4
From you is born the prizewinning, prize-bringing (horse), of extensive  power, creating his own superiority, whose snorting is real,
from you god-sped wealth, joy itself, from you the swift, speeding
courser, o Agni.
### 5
You, Agni, (are) the first god (whom) the god-seekers seek to attract here  with their hymnic visions—the mortals, o immortal, (seeking you)
whose tongue is gladdening,
who keep hatred away, domestic ally, household lord, no fool.
### 6
At a distance from us (keep) heedlessness, at a distance constraint, at a  distance all malevolence, as you protect us.
At evening (be) propitious, o Agni, son of strength, (to him) whom you  as god even here accompany with well-being.

12 (308) Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
6 verses: triṣṭubh
The first half of this hymn (vss. 1–3) describes the rewards Agni gives to a pious  sacrificer. The second half (vss. 4–6) is entirely different: it begs for release from  unspecified offenses done by us, and although Agni is addressed in the vocative  in all three verses, the tone is distinctly Ādityan, reminiscent of Vasiṣṭha’s pleas  for forgiveness from the most formidable of the Ādityas, Varuṇa, in Maṇḍala  VII. In fact, the last verse (6) has a plural addressee (“good ones worthy of the  sacrifice”) in addition to Agni, and the verse is repeated exactly in X.126.8, an  insistently Ādityan hymn.
### 1
Whoever will kindle you, Agni, with his offering ladle extended, whoever  will make food for you three times in the same day,
let him, victorious, be superior in heavenly brilliance in accordance with  your purpose, o Jātavedas—he the observant one. 2. Whoever will labor to bring fuel to you, rendering service to the face of  the great one, o Agni,
he, kindling (you) every evening, every dawn, follows along, thriving in  his wealth, smashing his foes.
### 3
Agni holds sway over lofty lordship, Agni over the prize, the highest  wealth.
He apportions treasure in due order to the mortal who does honor (to  him)—he the youngest, autonomous one.
### 4
Whatever we have done to you, youngest one, in our human nature or  through our heedless ways—whatever offense—
make us without offense through unbinding [/Aditi]: let loose our
transgressions in all directions, o Agni.
### 5
(Release us) from even a great offense in close quarters, Agni, from the  enclosure [=imprisoning] of gods and of mortals.
Let us, your comrades, never be harmed. Extend luck and lifetime to  kith and kin.
### 6
Just as then you released the buffalo-cow bound by the foot, you good  ones worthy of the sacrifice,
so release constraint from us. (Let) our lifetime be further
lengthened, Agni.

13 (309) Agni (or Assorted Divinities)
Vāmadeva Gautama
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The Anukramaṇī assigns this hymn either to Agni or to unspecified divinities, but  as has long been recognized, it is really a hymn appropriate to dawn, mentioning  the gods associated with this time of day: Dawn herself, the Aśvins, Savitar, and  especially the Sun, who is found in all five verses. It forms a pair with the following  hymn, IV.14, also devoted to Dawn though not so identified. For further on the  similarities of these two hymns, see the introduction to IV.14.
The last three verses are especially striking, with several vivid images of the tri umph of light over darkness in verses 3–4, and in the final verse (5) a speculative  question about the sun—why does it not fall out of the sky?
### 1
Agni has looked toward the vanguard of the Dawns—benevolent (Agni)  toward the treasure-conferring of the radiant (Dawns).
Drive, Aśvins, to the dwelling of the one of good action. The Sun, the  god, goes up with his light.
### 2
God Savitar has braced his radiant beam upright, brandishing his banner  like a warrior seeking cattle.
576 IV.14
Varuṇa, Mitra, (and the other Ādityas?) proceed according to their
commandment, when they cause the Sun to mount into heaven.
### 3
The one whom they created to pull apart the darkness—those
[=Ādityas?] with fixed peaceful abodes, who do not unharness until
(reaching) their goal—
that Sun, do the seven golden mares, youthfully exuberant, convey as spy  of the whole moving world.
### 4
You drive with the (horses) that convey best, as you unravel the thread,  stripping off the black garment (of night), o god.
The rays of the Sun, shaking the darkness like a hide (for tanning), have  set it down in the waters.
### 5
Not held firm, not tied down—how does this one not fall down, head  over heels?
With what autonomous power does he journey? Who has seen it? As  prop of heaven, utterly fixed, he protects the vault.
## 14 
14 (310) Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Like IV.13 this is a dawn hymn, and, as was noted there, it is closely paired with  that hymn. The chief divinities are the same, mentioned in more or less the same  order: Agni, Dawn, the Aśvins, Savitar, and the Sun; the final verses are identical;  and the first two verses are stylistic variants of each other. In verse 1 of both hymns  Agni looks toward the Dawns, and the Aśvins [/Nāsatyas] are urged to come to the  sacrifice; in verse 2 Savitar braces his beacon, and the Sun rises.
The other two verses (3–4) deviate somewhat. In IV.13 these were devoted to the  Sun, conveyed by seven mares, confronting darkness. Here verse 3 concerns Dawn  as the horse conveying the Sun: the equine theme of IV.13.3 is thus matched, but  with a different focus. In both hymns verse 4 also concerns driving, with horses that  are “the best conveyors” (váhiṣṭha), but in IV.13 it is the Sun who is being conveyed,  whereas in IV.14 it is the two Aśvins (unnamed).
These paired hymns give us valuable insight into the R̥gvedic poets’ composi tional techniques, showing how the poets could produce variety even from a tem plate of fairly specific themes (here vss. 1–2), and where the template allowed more  freedom in developing those themes (here vss. 3–4).
### 1
God Agni, Jātavedas, has looked toward the Dawns, shining with all  their might.
Here, o Nāsatyas [=Aśvins], wide-ranging with your chariot, drive up to  this sacrifice of ours. 2. God Savitar has braced his beacon upright, making light for all creation. He has filled heaven and earth and the space between—the Sun showing  himself ever more widely with his rays.
### 3
The ruddy (mare) conveying (him) hither has come with her light, the  great showy one, showing herself ever more with her rays.
The goddess awakening (the world) for good faring, Dawn speeds with  her well-yoked chariot.
### 4
Let the best conveyors convey you two [=Aśvins] here—the (best)  chariots and horses at the break of dawn—
for here are soma drinks for you two to drink the honey. At this sacrifice  here, o bulls, exhilarate yourselves.
### 5
Not held firm, not tied down—how does this one not fall down, head  over heels?
With what autonomous power does he journey? Who has seen it? As  prop of heaven, utterly fixed, he protects the vault.

15 (311) Agni (1–6), Somaka Sāhadevya (7–8), Asvins (9–10) ́
Vāmadeva Gautama
10 verses: gāyatrī
This final hymn of the Agni cycle in Maṇḍala IV consists of ten verses. Its length  marks it as out of order in the cycle, since it follows a sequence of shorter hymns,  but its internal structure is not entirely clear. It is generally agreed that the first  three verses form a tr̥ca dedicated to Agni, and could therefore, as an independent  hymn, be properly placed in the Agni cycle. The next three verses (4–6) could also  form a tr̥ca to Agni and could likewise be properly placed, but the mention of  Sr̥ñjaya Daivavāta suggests that the final four verses (7–10), a dānastuti to Somaka  Sāhadeva, belong with verses 4–6, since Somaka’s father, Sahadeva, is elsewhere  (Aitareya Brāhmaṇa 7.34) identified as a Sr̥ñjaya.
We are of the opinion that the hymn consists of an originally independent sin gle tr̥ca (vss. 1–3), and a second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) with a loosely attached four-verse  dānastuti (7–10), but that it is unlikely that either of the tr̥cas formed a part of the  original cycle. Note especially that the two preceding hymns, IV.13–14, are really  not standard Agni hymns, but more generally applicable to the divinities of dawn,  and this change in subject matter suggests that these dawn-centered hymns were  added at some point at the end of the Agni cycle proper. Only later were the frag ments found in IV.15 appended to that enlarged cycle.
In any case, all three verses of the first tr̥ca concern Agni’s circling of the sacri fice, a ritual act characteristic of the animal sacrifice, as we have seen previously in  this maṇḍala (IV.6.3–5). The second tr̥ca, especially its second verse (5), seems to  concern militant Agni and suggests that only a mortal who is a hero himself can
578 IV.16
control such a fire: the implication is that Sr̥ñjaya Daivavāta, mentioned in verse  4, is such a man. This provides a transition to the “praise of the gift” in verses  7–10, where a prince of the Sr̥ñjaya family is the patron. The poet praises Prince  Sāhadevya for giving him two horses (playfully in vs. 7) and prays to the Aśvins  to reward the prince with a long life. There is another, more subtle connection  between 4–6 and 7–10: the last verse of the tr̥ca (vs. 6) alludes to the ritual drink  soma (as “the red child of heaven”), though it is not named; the name (or hypo
coristic: note the -ka-suffix characteristic of nicknames) of the patron in 7–10 is  Somaka (vs. 9).
### 1
Agni, the Hotar at our ceremony, while being a prizewinning (horse), is  led around,
the god devoted to the sacrifice among the gods.
### 2
Agni drives with triple toil around the ceremony like a charioteer, establishing a pleasurable offering among the gods.
### 3
Agni, the lord of the prize, the sage poet, has marched around the  oblations,
establishing treasures for the pious.
### 4
Here is the one who is kindled in front when Sr̥ñjaya Daivavāta (is  present),
the brilliant (Agni) who belittles the foes.
### 5
Over such a fire as this (only) a hero should hold sway as mortal  (master),
over this one who has sharp fangs but grants rewards.
### 6
Him like a winning steed, like the red child of heaven [=soma?],
they keep grooming day after day.
### 7
If he will “awaken” me with two fallow bays—Prince Sāhadevya— I will “get up” like one summoned.
### 8
And these two fallow bays, worthy of honor, from Prince Sāhadevya I took as soon as they were offered.
### 9
He is yours, god Aśvins—Prince Sāhadevya.
Let him be long-lived—(this) Somaka.
### 10
You god Aśvins, make Prince Sāhadevya long-lived.

16 (312) Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
21 verses: triṣṭubh
This first hymn of the Vāmadeva Indra cycle is rich in mythological material. It  begins with two verses devoted to the journey motif—Indra coming to our soma  sacrifice—but already in the second half of verse 2 and the first half of verse 3 the legendary poet and sage Uśanā Kāvya, who will figure later in the hymn, is intro duced by indirection. The Vala and Vr̥tra myths are interwoven in the next section  of the hymn, verses 3cd through 8, their interpenetration encouraged by the fact  that almost no participants are explicitly named in the earlier part of the section.  The last two verses clearly separate the two myths: verse 7 by naming Vr̥tra, verse 8  by the very words of the dog Saramā and her naming of Indra’s companions in the  Vala myth, the Aṅgirases.
Verses 9–14 concern the saga of the hero Kutsa, the poet Uśanā Kāvya, and  Indra, a story that is, as usual, narratively elusive. As noted above, Uśanā Kāvya  was introduced earlier in the hymn by name; he is not named in this section, but  deeds involving him in other references to the myth are also found here: Indra and  Kutsa’s joint journey to his house for help (vs. 10ab; cf., e.g., I.130.9) and the help  he provides to their venture (vs. 11), help which elsewhere takes the material form  of the mace he presents to Indra (I.121.12, V.34.2).
Our version also has the curious motif of the woman who seeks to tell the dif ference between Indra and Kutsa, who have identical appearance (vs. 10cd). This  reminds us of the Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa story (JB III.199–200), in which Kutsa was  born from Indra’s thigh and therefore looks identical to Indra. Kutsa takes advan tage of this by having sex with Indra’s wife, who claims, when Indra discovers them  together, not to be able to tell Indra and Kutsa apart. The Jaiminīya Brāhmaṇa  story appears, at least to us, to have been secondarily generated to explain the enig matic motif in our R̥gvedic verse, which does not suggest any misbehavior on the  part of the truth-distinguishing woman. Certainly Indra and Kutsa in partnership  go on to destroy named and nameless enemies and to tear off the wheel of the Sun’s  chariot (vss. 12–13), an action also prominent, if enigmatic, in other mentions of  this story (I.130.9, I.174.5, V.29.10). A successful act of distinguishing Indra (from  Kutsa?) seems to be alluded to in verse 14b, bringing closure to this motif. This  recognition was aided by the strong light of the sun. It is unclear whether the con tribution of the sun’s light here has anything to do with the damage inflicted on his  chariot by Indra and Kutsa.
The remainder of the hymn consists of appeals to Indra for help in contests and  battles and for largesse (vss. 15–19), with two closing verses (20–21) summing up the  making of the poem and the hopes we have of it.
The hymn is full of deep and surface puns, phonological play, and subtle echoes  across verses, and the poet takes some delight in setting up and then frustrating our  grammatical and mythological expectations.
### 1
Let him drive here (to be) really present—the bounteous one possessing  the silvery drink. Let his fallow bays run to us.
It is just for him that we have pressed the well-skilled stalk. Being
hymned, he will make his meal here.
### 2
Unhitch as if at the end of your road, o champion, in order to find  exhilaration in this soma-pressing of ours today.
580 IV.16
Like Uśanā, the ritual adept [=Agni] will recite his solemn speech, his  thought, for the lordly one who attends to it—
### 3
Bringing the rites to realization like the sage poet [=Uśanā Kāvya] a  secret, when the bull [=pressing stone] will chant as he drinks out  the gush.
In just that way he [=Indra?] begot the seven bards of heaven; just with the  (coming of) day they created the ritual patterns as they were singing. 4. When the sun, beautiful to see, was found through their chants [/with its  rays], they made shine the great light which is at dawn.
The best of men in his dominance made (it possible) for men to  penetrate the blind, bilious shades of darkness with their gaze.
### 5
Possessing the silvery drink, Indra increased without limit. He filled  both world-halves with his greatness.
Even beyond that did it reach—the greatness of him who surmounted  all the worlds.
### 6
The able one, knowing all manly (labors), together with his eager  companions, gave leave to the waters.
The fire-priests, who split the stone just with their words, opened the  pen full of cows.
### 7
You smashed away Vr̥tra, who had been enclosing the waters. Of one  mind with you, Earth helped your mace.
You sped the seaward floods forward, becoming their lord by your  power, you daring champion.
### 8
When you tore open the rock for the waters, o much-invoked one,  Saramā had appeared to you before:
“As our leader, tear out an abundant prize, breaking apart the cowpens,  being sung by the Aṅgirases.”
### 9
In your dominance you came here to the poet in need [=Kutsa?] at the  winning of the sun, o bounteous one with your mind on men.
With your help you urged him on at the invocation to heavenly
brilliance; but the Dasyu, possessing magic arts but no sacred
formulation, sank down.
### 10
Drive here to the home (of Uśanā Kāvya) with your Dasyu-smashing  mind. In companionship with you, Kutsa will become eager.
Do you two, having the same form, sit down each in his own womb.  She is trying to distinguish between you two—she is a woman who  distinguishes the truth.
### 11
Seeking help, you drive with Kutsa on the same chariot—you, the  goader of the Wind, the master of the two fallow bays,
seeking to hold onto the two silvery (horses of the Wind) like a prize  to be secured, so that on that day the poet [=Uśanā Kāvya] will exert  himself for decisive (help). 12. For Kutsa you laid low insatiable Śuṣṇa, who brings bad harvest, with  his thousands, before the day’s first meal.
Immediately crush out the Dasyus with (the weapon) that is Kutsa, and  then tear off the wheel of the Sun at the moment of encounter.
### 13
You subjugated Pipru Mr̥gaya, swollen with power, to R̥jiśvan, the son  of Vidathin.
You scattered down the dark fifty thousand. You shredded their
fortresses, like worn-out age a cloak—
### 14
Placing your body in nearness to the sun, so that the form of you, the  immortal one, could be distinguished,
like a wild elephant, clothing yourself in might, and fearsome like a lion  when you bear your weapons.
### 15
To Indra have desires gone seeking goods, taking their pleasure at the  soma-pressing as if at a (contest) having the sun as its prize,
(desires) seeking fame, laboring with hymns, delightful like a home, like  prosperity beautiful to see.
### 16
Just him, Indra easy to call, would we call upon for you—him who  performed the many manly (labors),
who quickly brings a prize worth securing even to a singer like me, him  whose largesse is eagerly sought.
### 17
If a sharp missile will fly in an instant amid some one of the peoples, o  champion,
if there will be a terrible clash, o comrade, then, as ever, become the  herdsmen of our body.
### 18
Will you be the helper of Vāmadeva’s insights? Will you be a partner— no wolf—at the winning of prizes?
We have come after you (who are) solicitude for us. Widely proclaimed,  may you always be there for the singer.
### 19
While we dominate the strangers in every contest with these men who  seek you, Indra, with the bounteous ones, o bounteous one,
just as the heavens dominate with their heavenly brilliance, may we find  elation through many nights and autumns.
### 20
Just in this way we have made a sacred formulation for Indra, the  bull-strong bull, as the Bhr̥gus do a chariot,
so that he will never keep us far away from his partnership, and he will  be our powerful helper, the protector of our bodies.
### 21
– Now praised, o Indra, now being sung, make refreshment swell for the  singer like rivers.
A new sacred formulation has been made for you, o you of the fallow  bays. Through our insightful thought may we be charioteers who
always win.

17 (313) Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
21 verses: triṣṭubh, except ekapadā virāj 15
The hymn begins with the simple declaration “You, Indra, are great,” and in some  sense the rest of the hymn just develops this statement. The first section of the hymn  (vss. 1–8) treats Indra’s deeds in the past (though with some interludes in the pres ent, esp. vs. 5), particularly the Vr̥tra slaying and its cosmic repercussions. Verse 8  sums up this section by detailing the qualities that make Indra worthy of our atten tion. In verses 9–13 Indra’s abilities to conquer foes and win prizes are celebrated  for their present relevance. The following two verses (14 and 15, its stunted single pāda adjunct) make a brief and quite obscure foray into the Etaśa myth. The final  five verses (16–20), before the last (21) repeated from IV.16.21, express our hopes  for Indra’s bounty and aid, and, especially, our longing for him to be in affectionate  relationship with us.
Several themes surface from time to time in the hymn. Indra is often called  maghávan “bounteous (patron)” throughout (vss. 7, 8, 9, 11, 13 [twice], 20), even  though our prayers for goods and services do not become insistent until the end.  More striking is the motif of Indra’s birth and, especially, the uncertainty about  the identity of his father. His birth in mentioned in verses 2, 4, 7, and 12. In verse  4 it is said that Heaven is considered to be his begetter, but “is considered” throws  that statement into question, and it is not even clear whether “the best craftsman,”  to whom the act is (also?) ascribed, is Heaven or not. It may well be Tvaṣṭar, called  “good craftsman” elsewhere (I.85.9) and in apparent parental relationship with  Indra in some passages (e.g., III.48.2–4; see also the next hymn, IV.18.3). Verse 12ab  casts even more doubt on his parentage, which Indra himself seems not to be clear  about. This birth motif foreshadows the next hymn, the famous IV.18 featuring the  direct speech of Indra’s mother at the time of his birth.
### 1
You, Indra, are great. To you did Earth, to you did Heaven
magnanimously yield dominion.
After you smashed Vr̥tra with your strength, you let loose the rivers,  which had been swallowed by the serpent.
### 2
At your birth Heaven trembled and Earth flinched in fear of your  turbulence and of the battle fury that is yours.
The well-founded mountains throbbed, the wastelands shuddered, and  the waters ran.
### 3
He split the mountain, hurling his mace with his strength, revealing his  power, displaying his might.
He smashed Vr̥tra with his mace in his exhilaration. With their bull
struck down, the waters ran swiftly.
### 4
Rich in heroes, Heaven is considered to be your begetter. The best  craftsman was the creator of Indra, who begot him, booming and bearing the good mace, not to be moved,  any more than the Earth from its seat.
### 5
Who, just alone, sets the lands in motion—the king of the separate  peoples, Indra invoked by many.
All celebrate him, the real one, and celebrate the generosity of the god  to the singer and the patron.
### 6
Entirely his were the soma-drinks; entirely for the lofty one were the  most exhilarating exhilarating-drinks.
Entirely the goods-lord of goods you became. You placed all the
separate peoples in (the path of) your giving, Indra.
### 7
And on first being born, you placed all the separate peoples in (the path  of) your onslaught, Indra.
With your mace you hewed apart the serpent who was lying against the  (mountain) slopes, o bounteous one.
### 8
(I call upon) him who smashes entirely, bold and brawny Indra, the  great and limitless bull bearing the good mace,
who is the smasher of Vr̥tra and the winner of the prize, the giver of  bounties, the bounteous one who brings good presents.
### 9
This one forces his united opponents into hiding, he who alone is famed  as the bounteous one in contests.
This one brings the prize that he wins. Might we be dear to him in his  partnership.
### 10
And this one is famed for conquering and smiting, and this one brings  the cows forward to become his through battle.
When Indra makes his fury real, everything, both what stays firm and  what flinches, becomes afraid before him.
### 11
Indra conquered the cows altogether, altogether (the bounties) in gold and  horses—he who through the many (autumns) is a bounteous patron,
the best of men with these able men of his, the apportioner of wealth  and the one who brings the goods altogether.
### 12
How much does Indra know of his mother, how much of his father, his  begetter, who begot him?
He who in an instant raises his tempest, as the wind does when sped by  thundering clouds,
### 13
He deprives the man dwelling peacefully of his peace. The bounteous  one raises the dust in confusion,
a shatterer like Heaven with its missiles. But the bounteous one places  his praiser in goods.
### 14
This one impelled the wheel of the Sun and stopped Etaśa as he ran. Moving crookedly, he [=Agni?] sprinkles it [=Sun? Sun’s horse or
wheel?] at the black base of the hide, on the womb of this realm,
### 15
Like a Hotar performing his own sacrifice on the dark (hide).
### 16
Seeking cows, seeking horses, seeking prizes, we, inspired poets, rousing  the bull Indra for partnership;584 IV.18
seeking wives, we bestir the wife-giver providing imperishable aid, like a  bucket in a well.
### 17
Become our protector, showing yourself as a friend who watches over  and dispenses mercy to your comrades in soma,
our partner and father, the best father of fathers, the creator conferring  vitality on the man longing for wide space.
### 18
Become the helper and partner of those seeking your partnership. Being  sung, Indra, confer vitality on the man who praises,
for we have fervently acted for you, exalting you with these
labors, Indra.
### 19
Indra the bounteous, praised when he (smashes) obstacles, alone  smashes those many and unopposable (obstacles).
The singer is dear to him, under whose protection none, neither gods  nor mortals, obstruct (him [=the singer]).
### 20
In just this way shall bounteous Indra, conferring abundance, make  these things come true for us, as the unassailable sustainer of the
bordered domains.
You, as king of (all) the races, set fame upon us, which is a great thing  for the singer.
### 21
– Now praised, o Indra, now being sung, make refreshment swell for the  singer like rivers.
A new sacred formulation has been made for you, o you of the fallow  bays. Through our insightful thought may we be charioteers who
always win.

18 (314) Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
13 verses: triṣṭubh
A famous and enigmatic hymn recounting the prodigious and unnatural birth of  Indra, partly in dialogue form. The hymn begins with a two-verse exchange between  Indra’s mother and the as-yet-unborn Indra: she tries to persuade him to be born  in normal fashion, but, like many heroes world-wide, he insists on an unusual exit,  from her side. Indra is already conscious of his great destiny (see vs. 2cd). The preg
nancy has lasted abnormally long (see vs. 4ab), and after the birth Indra’s mother  appears to abandon him to make his own way (vss. 3ab, 4ab, 8ab, 10cd), but also  hides him (vs. 5ab) and worries about his fate (vs. 11ab). Again like heroes the world  over, Indra is born full-grown and ready to perform great feats (see vs. 5cd), so  that his mother’s protection is not necessary. In verse 3 he follow his mother as she  abandons him and ends up at Tvaṣṭar’s house, where he drinks Tvaṣṭar’s soma.  Elsewhere Tvaṣṭar is presented as Indra’s father (e.g., III.48.2–4, possibly in the previous hymn IV.17.4), and by stealing and drinking his soma, Indra defeats him  (see III.48, where Indra’s mother abets him). Our verse contains no mention of this  rivalry and conflict, but it may be alluded to indirectly toward the end of the hymn  (see below).
In the middle part of the hymn (vss. 6–9) another set of voices (at least in our  opinion) joins the dialogue, that of various waters. These waters seem to represent  benevolent foster mothers (see esp. vss. 7–8), like the rivers attending the birth of  Urvaśī’s son in X.95.7, and their protective aid for Indra contrasts with his mother’s  ambivalence and alienation. But they are also assimilated to the waters released by  Indra in the Vr̥tra myth, as Indra’s mother makes explicit in verse 7. It may be that  both identities were suggested by a natural phenomenon, the breaking of a preg
nant woman’s waters right before birth; the sudden release of those waters is remi niscent of the release in the Vr̥tra myth, while the association of the waters with the  infant being born suggests their beneficent relationship with the fetus in the womb.  Indra’s mother ends this section by disavowing any blame for Indra’s temporary  disadvantage in the Indra–Vr̥tra battle (vs. 9). If we are correct, the second pāda of  this verse alludes glancingly to snakes’ ability to reconfigure their jaws to swallow  large prey, a striking naturalistic image—one of the incidental fragments of realia  to be gleaned from the R̥gveda.
The final verses of the hymn are even more puzzling than what precedes them.  After the episode of the waters and the Vr̥tra battle, we return to the original scene  of Indra’s birth and his mother’s abandonment of him (vs. 10), though in her worry  about his isolation she follows him (vs. 11ab), a mirror image of him following her  in verse 3ab. He does find a companion to aid in the Vr̥tra battle, namely Viṣṇu,  in verse 11cd. The next verse (12) asks a series of rhetorical questions—or they  would be rhetorical if we were certain of the answers. The questions center around  a family tragedy of a type very familiar from world mythology: a father with mur derous intent toward his son (possibly still in the womb; vs. 12b) and the killing  of the father by the son (vs. 12d), an act that leaves his mother a widow (vs. 12a).  Is the father Tvaṣṭar, mentioned briefly and without hostility in the earlier part of  the hymn (vs. 3), or Vr̥tra, whose destruction was depicted several times (vss. 7cd,  9)—or both, or neither? In any case the questions are reminiscent of the question  near the end of the famous Indra-Vr̥tra hymn I.32, when Indra flees after winning  the battle: verse 14 “Whom did you see, Indra, as the avenger of the serpent when  fear came into your heart after you smashed him, / and when you crossed over the  ninety-nine flowing rivers, like a frightened falcon through the airy realms?” And  the final verse of IV.18 (13) seems to depict Indra after such a flight, alone and  in exile, eating taboo food out of necessity and witness to the dishonoring of his  mother because of her widowed state. His own condition only improves when the  falcon steals soma and brings it to him (vs. 13d), a tale that will be treated later in  this cycle in IV.26–27.
Although the abrupt shifts of scene and chronology and the lack of context  in each new scene produce some frustration in the reader (not to speak of the
586 IV.18
translator), the vivid focus of each episode and the dramatic tension in each snippet  of speech cause the hymn to resonate in the imagination long after a more rational  account would have done.
### 1
[Indra’s Mother:] Here is the ancient proven path from which all the gods  were born.
Just from it should he be born full-grown.—Do not cause your mother  to fall [=miscarry] in that way.
### 2
[Indra:] I will not go out from there—it’s a hard plunge. I will go out  crossways, from your side.
Many are the things as yet undone that are to be done by me: I will do  battle with one and make peace with another.
### 3
[Narrator:] He gazed after his mother going away. “I cannot not follow— now shall I follow!”
In the house of Tvaṣṭar, Indra drank soma, a hundred’s worth of the  pressed (drink) in the two cups.
### 4
[Narrator:] How could she put aside the one whom she bore for a  thousand months and many autumns?
For surely he has no equal among those born and those yet to be born. 5. [Narrator:] Thinking him somehow a disgrace, his mother concealed  Indra, who overflowed with heroic strength.
But he stood up on his own, clothing himself in a cloak. He filled the  two world-halves as he was being born.
### 6
[Indra:] These (waters) flow, babbling, like truthful women together  shouting their witness.
Ask them! What is this they are saying? What rock, what barrier are the  waters battering?
### 7
[Indra’s Mother:] What did they say as invitations to him? Do the waters  intend to take on Indra’s disgrace?
It was my son who set loose these rivers, after having smashed Vr̥tra with  his great murderous weapon.
### 8
[Various voices of the waters:] It was not because of me that the young  woman cast you aside. It was not because of me that Kuṣavā (Evil
Birth) swallowed you.
But it was certainly because of me that the waters would show mercy  to the child. It was certainly because of me that Indra stood up with  his might.
### 9
[Indra’s Mother:] It was not because of me that the cobra, having  pierced you down, smashed apart his jaws (to swallow) you, o
bounteous one.
Then, (though) pierced down, having gotten the upper hand, you utterly  crushed the head of the Dāsa with your murderous weapon. 10. [Narrator:] The heifer gave birth to the sturdy, powerfully charging,  unassailable bull, the brawny Indra.
The unlicked calf—his mother impelled him to wander, seeking by
himself a way for himself.
### 11
And his mother followed the track of the buffalo, (thinking,) “Yonder  gods are abandoning you, my son.”
Then Indra said as he was about to smash Vr̥tra: “Viṣṇu, my
companion, stride out widely.”
### 12
Who made your mother a widow? Who tried to smash you as you lay,  as you wandered?
What god was merciful toward you when you destroyed your father,  having grasped him by the foot?
### 13
[Indra:] Out of need I cooked for myself the entrails of a dog. I found  none who was merciful among the gods.
I saw his wife being dishonored. Then the falcon carried the honey
here to me.

19 (315) Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
Until the end, this hymn focuses almost entirely on the Vr̥tra-slaying and espe cially on the release of the waters after the slaying. In the first two verses Indra  is chosen, by the gods and the world-halves, for the task, and he assumes the  kingship. The actual slaying and the splitting of the mountains to set the waters  free occupy the next verses (through vs. 5), and other feats of Indra regarding  the waters—stopping them for his clients Turvīti and Vayya in verse 6, impreg nating them in verse 7—are mentioned. Indeed, verse 7 lushly depicts the fertile  and fructifying power of liquid in many forms. This main section of the hymn is  brought to a close in verse 8, which efficiently summarizes the main points of the  Vr̥tra myth.
Verse 9 serves as a somewhat bizarre coda. It celebrates three of Indra’s great  deeds that are regularly mentioned together:  he rescues the shunned son of an  unmarried girl, makes a blind man see, and causes a lame man to walk (cf., e.g.,  II.13.12, 15.7; I.112.8). But here each of these deeds has an odd twist: the boy is  being eaten by female ants; the blind man “takes a serpent” (an unrecoverable pun  or piece of slang, in our view); and the lame man is “broken in the ‘pot’” or “breaks  the pot” (slang for “hip”?). And it is also unclear why this verse has been tacked  onto the end of a hymn that is otherwise remarkably consistent thematically. It may  be that the “unwed girls” (agrū́) in verse 7, a metaphor for the rivers, suggested to
588 IV.19
the poet the episode of the unwed girl (agrū́) who abandons her son out of shame,  and it may also be that this proverbial episode of a mother’s abandonment of her  son resonated with Indra’s own experience with his mother at his birth, treated so  dramatically in the preceding hymn (IV.18).
The hymn ends with two summary verses (10, 11). In the former the poet  announces to Indra the hymn he has just completed, while the latter is the refrain  verse of the Vāmadeva Indra cycle (see IV.16–17, 20–24).
### 1
So it is you, mace-wielding Indra, that all the gods, our easily invoked  helpers,
and both world-halves choose now—singling you out, the great one  alone, strong and lofty, at the smashing of Vr̥tra.
### 2
Like old men the gods let go, and you became the universal king, Indra,  acquiring your own true womb [=place].
You smashed the serpent lying around the flood; you dug out the courses  for all the nourishing streams.
### 3
The insatiable serpent, stretched out, lying against the seven slopes, did you dismember with your mace in his jointless part, o Indra—
(making him) not to be awakened, unawakening, gone to sleep.
### 4
Indra made the earth shake to its bottom with his strength, as the wind  does the water with its forces.
He knotted up the strongholds, eager in his own strength; he cut down  the peaks of the mountains.
### 5
They burst, as women burst out their embryo. Like chariots the stones  went forth all at once.
You satisfied (the waters) flowing widely, and you subdued their waves.  You made the blocked rivers flow, Indra.
### 6
For Turvīti and Vayya you brought to rest the great flowing watercourse  with its all-nourishing streams
and the moving flood, because of their reverence. You made the rivers  easy to cross, Indra.
### 7
He made the unwed girls swell like surging spurts (of water)—the  parched young women knowing the truth.
He saturated the wastelands and thirsty fields. Indra got milk from the  barren cows, who thus had a husband of wondrous power.
### 8
Having smashed Vr̥tra, he set loose the rivers, welcomed [/gurgling]  through many dawns and autumns.
Indra drilled out the streams, which had been surrounded and hard
pressed, to flow along the earth.
### 9
You brought the son of the unwed girl, as he was being eaten by female  ants, out from their lair, o master of the fallow bays.
The blind man saw after taking the serpent. The man broken in the
“pot” [=hip?] set out; his joints fit together. 10. Knowing them, I speak forth your ancient deeds, o inspired one, to  (you) who know the deeds,
in just the way that you accomplished them, o king—the bullish and  manly labors welcomed for themselves.
### 11
– Now praised, o Indra, now being sung, make refreshment swell for the  singer like rivers.
A new sacred formulation has been made for you, o you of the fallow  bays. Through our insightful thought may we be charioteers who

Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The general pattern of an invitation/journey hymn is followed here. Indra’s journey  to our sacrifice is treated in the first two verses, with his attendance at the sacrifice  and acceptance of the offerings found in the following two (3–4). The invitation is  summarized in verse 5. His reciprocal obligation to give generously to his worship
ers dominates the rest of the hymn, and without overt mention of the Vala myth,  the poet repeatedly likens Indra’s acts of giving to his opening of the cowpen and  releasing its contents (vss. 6, 8, 9). A subtle reference to the Vr̥tra myth may be  found in verse 7: no “obstructor” (vartár) keeps Indra from giving, using the root vr̥
“obstruct,” found in Vr̥tra, whose name is literally “obstacle.”
The hymn several times uses gambling vocabulary (vss. 3, 8), and there are some  other striking images, such as the two similes in the first half of verse 5.
### 1
Here to us from afar and here to us from nearby will powerful Indra  drive for help, creating his own superiority—
the lord of men with the mace in his arm, with his most powerful (men)  overcoming battlers in combat and conflicts.
### 2
Here to us let Indra drive with his fallow bays, right here, turned our way  for help and benefit.
He will stand—that mace-bearing, bounteous one, conferring
abundance—beside this sacrifice of ours at the gaining of prizes.
### 3
Setting this sacrifice of ours in front, o Indra, you will gain our intention. Like (a gambler) with the best throw to gain the stakes, with you, o
mace-bearer, might we win the contest with the stranger.
### 4
Being eager and of favorable mind in our midst, now (drink) of the  well-pressed soma, o autonomous one.
Drink, Indra, of the honey brought before you. You will reach complete  exhilaration with the soma-stalk coming from the back (of the
mountain).
590 IV.21
### 5
He who abounds in new seers like a fruited tree, who is a winner like a  man with a sickle,
much-invoked Indra do I invite here, setting my mind on him like a
dashing youth on a maiden.
### 6
He who is self-strong like a mountain, lofty and powerful Indra, born  from of old for conquest,
he splits open the *cowpen as a fearsome (wild beast) does a sturdy
(pen), (the pen) overflowing with goods like a bucket with water.
### 7
For whom by nature there now exists no obstructor and no hinderer of  benefit and bounty,
o strong and powerful one, boiling up and over, give riches to us, o
much invoked one.
### 8
You are master of wealth and of the peaceful dwelling of the settled  domains, and you open the pen of cows.
Doing your best for men in the clashes, hitting the jackpot, you are the  guide to an abundant heap of goods.
### 9
Because of what ability is he famed as the most able?—that ability by  which the lofty one does everything instantly.
He is the best at prying apart narrow straits for the man who does
much pious service, and he establishes material property for the
singer.
### 10
Do not neglect us! Bring and give us what of yours is to be given in  abundance to the pious man.
At this new gift we shall proclaim it in this hymn recited for you,
praising you, o Indra.

21 (317) Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The first verses of this hymn, especially 1 and 3, are quite reminiscent of the open ing of the preceding hymn, IV.20, with the invitation to Indra to come to our sac rifice from wherever he might be, and the hymn promises to be a straightforward  celebration of Indra’s presence at the sacrifice and our praise and offering to him, in  the hopes of his goods and help. But the hymn veers off into a different, and deeply  puzzling, direction. The pivot is verse 5, which begins with a relative clause as does verse 4, leading us to expect that the referent in verse 5 will be the same as in verse  4, namely Indra, the subject of our hymn. But it is not, as the last word reveals, but  rather the Hotar, here almost certainly the god Agni.
The next three verses (6–8) share a number of features: repeated phrases (espe cially the góhe phrase of 6b, 7c, 8c), metrical irregularity in their odd pādas (6c,  7a, 7c), morphological and syntactic parallelism, and patterns of phonological and  morphosyntactic repetition. But what they especially share is almost impenetrable  obscurity. In our admittedly speculative interpretation, these verses take off from  the Agni verse (5) and treat simultaneously the kindling of the ritual fire, which  initiates the sacrifice here and now, and the Vala myth. As we noted in the introduc tion to IV.20, the twin of this hymn in some ways, the Vala myth, is a backgrounded  model for Indra’s generous giving in that hymn. It should also be remembered that  the Agni hymns of this maṇḍala frequently take the Vala myth as their subject (see  esp. IV.1 and 2), despite the fact that Agni is not usually a participant in that myth.  Thus a condensed version of the Vala myth embedded in an Indra hymn but focus ing on Agni is compatible with the larger concerns of the Vāmadeva poets.
In verse 6 the gods coming to the sacrifice seem to be compared to the Aṅgirases  going to the Vala cave—though neither group is mentioned by name—and the seat  of both groups is identified as the “secret place” (góha) of the Auśija, a vr̥ddhi  derivative that we interpret as referring to the whole company of Uśij-priests, or  fire-priests. In the second half of the verse the ritual fire is kindled, though with  difficulty. The kindled fire roars to life in verse 7a, enabling the sacrifice to proceed  (pāda b) and the cows in the Vala cave to go forth (pādas cd)—expressed in increas ingly compressed phraseology. The final verse of this section (8) is the one that most  clearly alludes to the opening of the Vala cave, using several of the signature words  of that myth, including the verb vidát “found, finds,” which several times in the Vala  myth takes “cows” as object (I.62.3, V.45.8, X.68.11). But in our verse the object is  omitted, presumably to allow the simultaneous reading “cows” (for the Vala myth)  and “goods” (for the ritual here-and-now).
Having thus provided Indra with a mythic model for generous giving (however  cryptically phrased), the poet then reproaches Indra in verse 9 for not participating  in the sacrificial give-and-take. The poet ends the hymn with a more conventional  summary verse and plea for goods and help (vs. 10), followed by the Vāmadeva  Indra-cycle refrain (vs. 11).
### 1
Let Indra drive here, near to us, for help. Praised, let the champion be  here as our feasting companion,
he whose powers are many when he has grown strong, (whose)
overwhelming dominion, like heaven, will thrive.
### 2
Here will you praise the bullish forces of him alone, the powerfully  brilliant and powerfully generous man,
whose resolve, conquering and victorious like a sovereign king making  ceremonial distributions, overwhelms the separate peoples.
592 IV.21
### 3
Let Indra along with the Maruts drive here from heaven or from the  earth, swiftly from the sea or from fertile ground,
from the realm of solar glory, or from afar, from the seat of truth, to  help us.
### 4
Who is master of substantial, lofty wealth, him will we praise at the  ceremonial distributions—Indra,
who is the winner along with Vāyu when (refreshments) consisting of  cows are at stake and who boldly leads (us) forth to a better state. 5. Whoever, piling reverence upon reverence, rouses speech, begetting it in  order to perform the sacrifice,
aiming straight, granting many favors, he should bring Indra here to  the (ritual) seats with his hymns—he, the Hotar [=Agni?].
### 6
When they [=the gods/Aṅgirases?], seeking a holy place, will hasten to  the rock with holy fervor, taking their seats at the secret place of (the  company of) the fire-priests [=ritual ground/Vala cave?],
the Hotar [=Agni] of (the company) belonging to the household,  (though) he is hard to kindle, (comes into being) here—he who is the  great draft-horse for us in the (ritual) enclosures.
### 7
When in its entirety the explosive force of the devouring bull [=Agni]  accompanies him [=Agni?], for the praiser to take his reward,
when (it accompanies) him secretly to the secret place of (the company  of) the fire-priests, when (it accompanies him) in order (for the
praiser) to go forth to insight, forth to exhilaration—
### 8
When he opens out the mountain’s enclosures into wide spaces and  quickens the swift currents of the waters with gushes of milk,
he finds (the cows?) in the secret place of the buffalo, of the bull, when  those of good insight convey him for the prize.
### 9
Auspicious are your hands and well-fashioned your palms, as ones that  hold out largesse to the praiser, o Indra.
Why are you sitting it out? And why do you not find exhilaration? And  why do you not rouse yourself higher and higher to give?
### 10
Just in this way, Indra, the real sovereign king of goods, the smiter of  Vr̥tra, made wide space for Pūru.
O you praised by many, in accordance with your will, show your power  over wealth for us. Might I have a share in your divine help.
### 11
– Now praised, o Indra, now being sung, make refreshment swell for the  singer like rivers.
A new sacred formulation has been made for you, o you of the fallow  bays. Through our insightful thought may we be charioteers who  always win.

22 (318) Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
Within a slender frame depicting Indra’s presence at and participation in our sac rifice is fitted a celebration of Indra’s great deeds and, especially, his aggressiveness  in performing them. The hymn begins (vs. 1) with a brief catalogue of the elements  Indra wants at the ritual, which leads immediately to the praise of Indra’s uncon trolled power, the terror he inspires in the cosmos, and the fortunate result of his  greatest deed, the release of the waters following his defeat of Vr̥tra (vss. 2–7). Verse  8 marks a return to the ritual here-and-now, with a hope that our preparations will  bring Indra to our sacrifice. Verses 9–10 then list the various things we want Indra  to do for us, marked by the heavy repetition of “for us/to us” at the beginning of  every half-verse (a pattern actually begun in vs. 8c with “toward us,” and ending  with an extra repetition in the final pāda 10d). The hymn ends with the Vāmadeva  Indra-cycle refrain (vs. 11).
### 1
What of ours Indra enjoys and what he is eager for, that of ours will the  great, explosive one arrange to be right here:
the sacred formulation, the praise song, the soma, and the recitations— he, the bounteous, who goes on bearing the stone with strength,
### 2
The bull, hurling with his arms the four-edged (weapon), which is the  repository of bullish strength—the powerful, most manly, able one,
clothing himself in Paruṣṇī River [/gray] wool [=foam] for beauty—(the  Paruṣṇī River) in whose tufts he has wrapped himself for partnership  (with the Maruts).
### 3
The god who, being born as the best of gods, is great by reason of his  prizes and his great explosive powers,
having taken the eager mace in his arms, he makes heaven tremble by his  onslaught, as well as earth,
### 4
(And) all the (river)banks and the many (river)beds—(and) heaven  trembles, and the earth, before the towering one at his birth.
The explosive one brings the two mothers here [=Heaven and Earth?],  (brings) here (the milk? [=rain?]) of the cow. The winds in their
circling roar constantly like men.
### 5
These great (deeds) of you, the great one, o Indra, are to be proclaimed  at all the pressings:
that, o daring champion, having dared with daring, you worked over the  serpent with your mace and strength.
### 6
These (deeds) of yours all come true, o powerfully manly one: the cows  stream forth from the udder of a bull;
then, being afraid of you, o you of bullish mind, the rivers charge forth  at speed.594 IV.23
### 7
Right now, o Indra, master of the fallow bays, with your help these  goddesses, the sisters, are praised,
when you let loose those (waters) that had been hard pressed, to let
them flow along their long trajectory.
### 8
The (soma-)plant has been squeezed out like an exhilarating river. By  the labor of the laboring (priest), might the skill
of bright blazing (Agni) pull you here toward us, as a swift (horse pulls  on) the powerfully strong reins of the cow [=leather?].
### 9
For us activate your highest, most distinguished manly strengths and  powers altogether, o overpowering one.
For us weaken obstacles to become easily smashed: smash the deadly  weapon of the rapacious mortal.
### 10
To us listen well, Indra; to us mete out glittering prizes.
To us you impel all plentiful gifts. For us become a giver of cows, o
bounteous one.
### 11
– Now praised, o Indra, now being sung, make refreshment swell for the  singer like rivers.

23 (319) Indra (1–7, 11), Indra or R̥ta (8–10)
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The most salient feature of this hymn is the insistent series of questions that domi nate its first six verses. These questions all concern the sacrificers’ relationship to  Indra—which sacrificers have managed to attract and please Indra, how does Indra  know who is sacrificing and where, who receives Indra’s bounty and comradeship  and by what means. A preliminary and oblique answer is given in the second half  of verse 4: “the god will take cognizance of my truths,” that is, my praise and sacred  formulations, which will ensure that Indra will come to our sacrifice and share his  bounty. This answer is elaborated upon in the last verses of the hymn. After this  partial answer in verse 4 the questions take on a more intimate tone, inquiring into  the nature of Indra’s friendship with his worshipers, who are now his comrades,  whereas the first four verses were more concerned with the mechanics of attracting  Indra to our particular sacrifice. A striking feature of these question verses is that,  despite the poet’s eagerness for the presence and intimate comradeship of Indra,  the god is always referred to in the 3rd person, and indeed the poet and sacrificers  are almost always in the 3rd person as well. This 3rd-person distancing of Indra  reminds us somewhat of the doubts expressed about Indra’s existence or at least his whereabouts in other R̥gvedic hymns; the 3rd-person reference suggests that the  poet has not established the direct personal contact with the god that he desires. Verse 7 serves as a transition to the amplified answers of verses 8–10. In verse  7 Indra prepares to destroy “the lie,” the deceit that is inimical to the proper func tioning of the cosmos. After Indra’s destruction of the lie, the ubiquitous and  all-powerful force of “truth” can be celebrated in the remaining verses (8–10, before  the refrain verse 11). These three verses contain twelve instances of the word r̥tá “truth,” most of them initial in their pāda. As Paul Thieme illuminatingly pointed  out (1964: 30), r̥tá is the implicit answer to the questions posed earlier—the “how?”  questions answered with “by means of truth,” the “which sacrificer?” questions by  “the one who produces truth.” And we already saw that r̥tá as the answer was fore shadowed in the middle of the hymn (vs. 4cd). Thus we can satisfactorily resolve the  apparent lack of connection between the first two-thirds of the hymn, with its bar rage of questions about Indra and the sacrifice, and the last third, with its insistently  repeated “truth” and absolutely no mention of Indra, that led the Anukramaṇī to  suggest the possibility of two different divinities for the hymn (Indra 1–7, 11; R̥ta  8–10). Indra by destroying the lie (vs. 7) gave free rein to the workings of truth  described in verses 8–10.
### 1
How did he [=priest?] strengthen the great one [=Indra]? Enjoying the  sacrifice of what Hotar—(coming) to the soma as to an udder,
eager for, enjoying, and drinking the stalk—has he waxed high for the  blazing stakes?
### 2
What hero has reached shared exhilaration with him? Who has attained  it with his good favor?
Has his bright (course) appeared? Will he be here with help for the
strengthening of the one who has labored, eager to sacrifice?
### 3
How does Indra hear (the call) being called? How, hearing it, does he  know (the place for) his unhitching?
What are his many distributions (of goods)? How do they call him a  provider for the singer?
### 4
How will the man who has zealously labored and produced insights  attain the material goods that belong to him [=Indra]?
The god will take cognizance of my truths, when he has accepted the  homage that he will enjoy.
### 5
How and what comradeship with a mortal does the god enjoy at the  breaking of this dawn?
How and what is his comradeship for his comrades, who have tugged  their well-harnessed desire to him?
### 6
Is his comradeship then a drinking vessel for his comrades? When will we  proclaim his brotherhood to you?
The surges (of soma?) for him are a marvel, lovely to see for their beauty.  He seeks (the milk?) from the cow, very bright like the sun.
596 IV.24
### 7
Desiring to smash the lie, which is injurious and contrary to Indra, he  sharpens the edges sharp for jabbing,
after the powerful avenger of debts has also thrust our debts far away  to unknown dawns.
### 8
Of truth there exist many riches. The vision of truth smashes the  crooked,
and the signal call of truth bored open deaf ears—(the signal call) of  Āyu [=Agni], awakening and blazing.
### 9
Of truth the buttresses are firmly fixed; many are its gleaming marvels  to be marveled at.
By truth the nourishments urge themselves along the long way, and by  truth the cows approached truth.
### 10
(Whoever) holds fast to truth, just he wins truth. The explosive force of  truth hastens swiftly as it seeks cattle.
For truth the two (worlds) are wide, ample, and deep; for truth do they,  as the two highest milk-cows, give their milk.
### 11
– Now praised, o Indra, now being sung, make refreshment swell for the  singer like rivers.

## 24 
24 (320) Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 10
For most of its length (vss. 1–7), this hymn expresses in vivid language the familiar  notion of competing parties invoking Indra for help and offering him sacrificial  oblations and praise in return. Verses 3–5 are especially focused on the desperate  efforts of the human antagonists to enlist Indra’s might on their own side. It is also  clear that the offerings made by the successful supplicants must be made just so: in  addition to soma, a whole sacrificial menu is specified, with a special emphasis on  cooked foods (see esp. vss. 5, 7).
The last three verses (8–10, before the Vāmadeva refrain in 11) lay bare the mecha nism of the divine–human bargain that lies behind the first part of the hymn, and  indeed behind the whole R̥gvedic enterprise more generally. Rather than casting the  exchange relations between men and gods in the rosy light of mutual benefit and  voluntary cooperation, the verses present the acquisition of Indra’s aid by mortals  as a matter of cold-blooded haggling and crass calculations of price versus value  received. In our interpretation, Indra even has an agent, in the person of his own wife.  These verses are difficult, enigmatic, and apparently use the lexicon and phraseology of commercial transactions, a linguistic level barely attested elsewhere in Vedic.  Consequently the meaning of the verses is much disputed, and we will provide here  only our own interpretation (which follows Geldner’s in many, but not all, ways).
In verse 8 Indra (or perhaps his wife, a possibility raised by Oldenberg and  Geldner) takes a long hard look at the hostilities he’s being asked to participate in,  and his wife calls him back home, presumably to sit out the conflict or at least to  hold out for a better offer. In fact, in verse 9 Indra reports on a failed bit of hag
gling. An unidentified party seems to have made a bad deal, offering a higher price  for an inferior product, in this case probably the help of a god less powerful than  Indra (9a). With Indra’s own offer not accepted, he goes happily home “unsold”  (9b), remarking that the other party did not seize his chance to replace the inferior  product with a greater one, namely Indra himself (9c). He ends with what appears  to be a maxim, mocking the negotiation prowess of the other party (9d). Verse 10,  in our view (and ours alone?), is spoken by Indra’s wife, hawking her husband and  his obstacle-smashing talent and naming her price for his sale. The price, ten cows,  seems very low for such a god (especially considering how many hundreds of cows  are elsewhere given to mortal poets and priests, at least according to dānastutis),  and so it is possible or even likely that this is a bitter and rhetorical question, com plaining about the stinginess of mortal purchasers. In any case, it’s a limited-term  offer, as she expects Indra to be returned at the end of his mercenary service.
The allusion to dānastutis above was purposeful, for this little set of verses not  only occupies the position of a dānastuti in this hymn, but also has the slangy  and derisory tone of many dānastutis and the same recognition of the commer cial underpinnings of the relationship between patron and client. It may even be  that, using Indra’s withdrawal as model, the poet is indirectly complaining about  an ungenerous patron and threatening to withhold his poetic production unless he  receives a better deal.
### 1
What good praise will turn Indra here—the son of strength, facing our  way—for our benefit?
For the hero is the giver of good things to the singer, and he is the
herdsman of our tribute, o peoples.
### 2
He is to be summoned at the smashing of obstacles, he is to be invoked,  and he is well praised—Indra, whose benefit is real.
Here on his journey the bounteous one establishes wide space for the  mortal soma-presser devoted to the sacred formulation.
### 3
Just to him do men separately call at the encounter. Having given up  their bodies, they make him their preserver,
when the men of both camps, on opposite sides, have come to abandon  (their bodies) in the winning of offspring and descendants.
### 4
The settled peoples show their resolve at the hitching up (for battle), o  powerful one, while they are gasping on opposite sides in the winning  of the flood.
598 IV.25
When the battling clans have rolled together, just then do those on the  one side seek Indra at the moment of confrontation.
### 5
Just then do those on the other side perform sacrifice to his Indrian  strength; just then would the cooked food succeed the offering cake;
just then would soma exclude the non-pressers; and just then does he  [=Indra] find pleasure in the bull [=soma] for the sacrifice to proceed. 6. He [=Indra] makes wide space for the one who presses soma in just this  way for Indra who is eager for it.
The man with fully focused mind who never loses the track—just him  does he [=Indra] make his comrade in battles.
### 7
Whoever will press soma for Indra today, will cook the cooked foods,  and will roast the grains—
upon him will Indra, gladly receiving the recitations of the zealous one,  confer his bullish explosive force.
### 8
When the ballsy one surveyed the clash, when he looked upon the long  (war)drive of the stranger,
his wife roared the bull (back) into the house, though he had been
whetted sharp by the soma pressers.
### 9
[Indra:] “With a greater price he got a lesser deal. Unsold, I took  pleasure in going (home) again.
He did not replace the lesser with a greater. Skimpy skills milk the
bargain [?] dry.”
### 10
[Indra’s wife:] “Who buys this Indra of mine with ten cows,
when he’s going to smash obstacles? Then will he return him to me
again?”
### 11
– Now praised, o Indra, now being sung, make refreshment swell for the  singer like rivers.

25 (321) Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Although this hymn is superficially organized like IV.23, with a series of questions  in the first part of the hymn that are answered in the second part, it lacks the struc tural subtlety of IV.23, where the answers to the questions are implied, not stated,  and the questions themselves are quite varied. In this hymn the first three verses  pose a set of questions about the sacrificer, all but one (kásya “whose?” in vs. 3c)  introduced by nominative káḥ “who?” The benefits that accrue to the sacrificer so identified are detailed in most of the rest of the hymn (vss. 4–7), benefits highlighted  by the corresponding ill fate of the non-presser and non-giver described in verses  6–7. The hymn ends (vs. 8) with a comprehensive list of all who call upon Indra.
A salient feature of this hymn is the focus on the various kinds of relationships  a mortal may have with Indra: especially comradeship (vss. 1, 2, 6, 7), but also fel lowship (literally yoke-fellowship, vs. 2), brotherhood (vs. 2), friendship (vs. 6), and  kinship (vs. 6).
### 1
Who, a manly one with a desire for the god, eagerly enjoys the
comradeship of Indra today?
Or who, having his soma pressed when his fire has been kindled,
reverently invokes him for his great and decisive help?
### 2
Who shows reverence with his speech to him deserving of soma, or  becomes zealous at the breaking of the dawn?
Who is eager for the fellowship of Indra, who for the comradeship, who  for the brotherhood? Who (joins) together with his [=Indra’s] help for  the poet?
### 3
Who chooses the help of the gods today? Who reverently invokes the  Ādityas and Aditi for light?
Of whose pressed soma-plant do the Aśvins, Indra, and Agni drink  without losing track in their mind?
### 4
For him will Agni, the fire of the Bhāratas, hold out shelter, and for a  long time he will see the sun rising,
who says, “Let us press soma for Indra”—for the manly man, for the  best man of men.
### 5
The many do not overpower him, nor the few. Aditi will hold out wide  shelter for him.
Dear to Indra is the good performer (of sacrifice), dear the zealous man,  dear the hard-striver, dear the provider of soma.
### 6
The swaggering victor, the hero—Indra—makes the cooked food of the  hard-striver, the (soma-)presser, his own exclusive property.
No friend of the non-presser, nor comrade, nor kinsman, he strikes  down, deep down, the ill-strivers.
### 7
Indra does not agree to comradeship with a rich miser, nor does he, the  drinker of pressed soma, (agree to it) with one who does not press.
He rips away his possessions and smites him naked. He becomes
manifest exclusively to the presser, for his cooked food.
### 8
Indra do they call—those higher, those lower, and those in the middle;  Indra those travelling and Indra those settled down;
Indra those dwelling peacefully and those fighting; Indra superior men  competing for the prize.

## 26 
26 (322) Indra (1–3), Praise of Falcon (4–7) [Soma-Theft]
Vāmadeva Gautama
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The next two hymns treat the famous myth of the theft of Soma from heaven. Soma  was being held captive in a well-fortified citadel there, guarded by an archer named  Kr̥śānu. A falcon carried him off by stealth, and though shot at by Kr̥śānu, the  bird only lost a single feather (a tale told more fully in several Brāhmaṇa accounts).  Delivered to Manu, the first sacrificer, the soma was then available to be ritually  prepared for Indra, who cannot perform his great deeds without it.
The first of the two hymns is entirely couched as the speech of Indra (in our  view, though the Anukramaṇī assigns at least vss. 4–7 to the poet Vāmadeva and  takes the first three verses either as Vāmadeva’s speech [impersonating Indra] or  as Indra’s himself). It begins (vss. 1–3) as a standard Indra ātmastuti (self-praise),  with 1st-person boasting about his deeds and identities; see, for example, X.48–49.  (On the ātmastuti in general, see Thompson 1997.) In verse 4 he addresses his usual  warrior band, the Maruts, with a laud of the falcon as the best of birds because of  his soma-stealing exploit, which he then narrates in overlapping sequence (focusing  on the central deed, “he brought [the soma]”) in the remaining three verses (5–7).  The last half of verse 7 alludes glancingly to the associated departure of the shad owy figure Plenitude, the personification (or rather deification) of plenty, a frequent  companion of Soma’s, presumably because of the association of the distribution of  gifts with the performance of the Soma Sacrifice, especially the Morning Pressing.  Judging from verse 7 in this hymn and verses 2–3 in the next one, Plenitude prob
ably was carried away from heaven at the same time as Soma—though the poet  expresses some doubts in IV.27.3.
### 1
I became Manu and the sun. I am Kakṣīvant, the inspired seer.
I steered myself down to Kutsa, the son of Arjuna. I am Kavi Uśanā.  Look at me!
### 2
I gave land to the Ārya; I (gave) rain to the pious mortal.
I led the bellowing waters. It is my will that the gods followed.
### 3
I, in my exhilaration, broke apart all at once the nine and ninety
fortresses of Śambara,
and the hundredth, his dwelling place, to complete it, when I helped  Divodāsa Atithigva.
### 4
Let that bird stand out from (all other) birds, o Maruts, the swift-flying  falcon from (all other) falcons,
because the fine-feathered one, with his independent power that needed  no (chariot-)wheel, brought to Manu the oblation that is pleasing to  the gods.
### 5
When he brought it from there, quivering (in fear), the bird, swift as  thought, was sent surging along the wide path. He traveled swiftly with the somian honey, and the falcon found
fame here.
### 6
Flying straight, the falcon, the bird, hanging onto the plant, brought  from afar the gladdening, exhilarating drink,
the soma, holding it firmly, having the gods on his side, having taken it  from yonder high heaven.
### 7
Having taken it, the falcon brought the soma, a thousand pressings and  ten thousand all at once.
Plenitude left behind the hostilities then, (as) in the exhilaration of soma  the non-fool (leaves behind) fools.
## 27 
27 (323) Falcon (1–4), Falcon or Indra (5) [Soma-Theft]
Vāmadeva Gautama
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except śakvarī 5
The second of the pair of hymns devoted to the soma-theft, this one is told from  Soma’s point of view, with Soma speaking the first two verses (again, in our opin ion), in which Soma engages in some ātmastuti of his own. He boasts of his own  knowledge (vs. 1ab) and power (vs. 2ab), but also in almost breathlessly abrupt  fashion relates the sudden appearance of the falcon, his rescuer (vs. 1d) from con finement (vs. 1b). Asserting that he was complicit in his escape (vs. 2ab), he then  describes their departure, including that of Plenitude (see the introduction to the  last hymn).
The next two verses (3–4) freeze the dramatic moment when the archer Kr̥śānu,  guardian of Soma, shoots at the fleeing falcon with his precious cargo, and man ages only to shoot off one feather. The final verse (5) depicts Indra about to drink  the soma, now ritually prepared and offered by the priests. In keeping with the  archery theme, the verb used of Indra’s approach to the soma is an idiom (práti √dhā) ordinarily used of fixing an arrow to a bowstring and aiming it at the target.
### 1
[Soma:] Even though still in the womb, I knew all their births through  and through—those of the gods—
but a hundred metal fortifications guarded me. Then the falcon!—and  swiftly I flew away.
### 2
[Soma:] He certainly did not carry me away against my will; I was  superior to him in energy and valor.
Plenitude left behind the hostilities (which were just standing) still, and  (the falcon), swelling with strength, overtook the winds.
### 3
When the falcon then roared down from heaven, when—or if—they  carried Plenitude away from there,
when the archer Kr̥śānu, alert in mind, released and let fly his bow-string  down toward him,
602 IV.28
### 4
Flying straight, the falcon brought him to the companions of Indra from  the lofty back (of heaven), just as (the Aśvins brought) Bhujyu (home,  with their birds).
A feather *of the winged one, of the bird launched then on its course,  flew between (heaven and earth).
### 5
Now then the gleaming tub anointed with cows [=milk], the swelling,  glistening stalk,
the foremost of the honeyed drink held out by the Adhvaryus—
bounteous Indra will aim it for drinking—
the champion will aim it for drinking to exhilaration.
## 28 
28 (324) Indra, or Indra and Soma
Vāmadeva Gautama
5 verses: triṣṭubh
After the preceding two hymns devoted to the theft of soma and the preparation  and offering of this ritual drink to Indra, this hymn shows the results, celebrating  the great martial deeds that Indra was capable of, once he had acquired the soma.  Indeed, Soma is presented as the equal partner of Indra in the performance of  these deeds. The deeds themselves are the familiar ones:  the slaying of Vr̥tra in  order to free the waters (vs. 1), the tearing off of the Sun’s wheel with the Śuṣṇa  saga obliquely alluded to (vs. 2), the destruction of earthly foes (vss. 3–4), and  the opening of the Vala cave (vs. 5). The hymn is marked by a clever bit of ring  composition: the waters freed from Vr̥tra’s imprisonment are as if “covered over”  (ápihitā) in verse 1, while the same adjective “covered over” is found also in verse 5  (ápihitāni), where it refers both to those waters and to the cows freed from the Vala  cave—thus suggesting the deep-structure similarity of those two myths.
### 1
With you as yokemate, o Soma, and in partnership with you, Indra made  the waters flow for Manu.
He smashed the serpent; he let the seven rivers stream. He opened them  up, like holes that had been covered over.
### 2
With you as yokemate, o drop, Indra with his strength in a single day tore  down the wheel of the Sun,
which was rolling along the lofty back (of heaven). A whole lifetime of  great deceit was set aside.
### 3
Indra smashed and Agni burned the Dasyus before midday at the  moment of confrontation, o drop.
With his missile he laid low many thousands of them, who were
travelling to the house of no exit [=grave] as if by their own intention. 4. O Indra, you made the Dasyus the lowest of all and the Dāsa clans  deprived of laud.
You two oppressed and crushed down your rivals and found requital  with your deadly weapons.
### 5
In just this way (did it come) true, o bounteous ones: you two, o Indra  and Soma, kept pounding the horse-pen and that of the cow;
you gave leave to the things that were covered with the stone [=waters/ cows] (to flow), having drilled through even the places of the earth.

Vāmadeva Gautama
5 verses: triṣṭubh
A fairly straightforward invitation and journey hymn. Indra is urged to drive to  our sacrifice, ignoring rival pressers, to drink soma jointly with us, and, as usual, to  provide us with help and with wealth.
### 1
Praised, o Indra, with your fallow bays drive here right up to us, with  prizes and with help, to find exhilaration for yourself;
(drive) even across the many pressings of the stranger, being hymned by  songs, as one whose benefit is real.
### 2
For the manly one, ever attentive, drives here, when being called by the  pressers to the sacrifice—
he who, with his good horses, thinking himself non-frightening, becomes  exhilarated along with the heroes who have pressed the soma.
### 3
Cause his ears to hear—to rouse him, to make him reach exhilaration  following our pleasing instruction.
Boiling up and over for our benefit, powerful Indra will make
fearlessness and good fords for us.
### 4
He who will come here with his help to a man in distress, to an inspired  poet who calls and hymns just so—
the mace-bearer putting his swift (horses) to the chariot-pole in person— hundreds and thousands (of them).
### 5
Aided by you, bounteous Indra, might we—inspired poets and patrons— hymning (you) be yours,
for your giving of desirable (wealth) consisting of much livestock, as we  receive our share of the wealth coming from lofty heaven.

30 (326) Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
24 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 8, 24, arranged in trcas ̥
This long hymn, constructed of triplets, begins with a celebration of Indra’s  supreme power (vss. 1–3) and ends with a summary of the same (vss. 22–23, with604 IV.30
24 a pendant). In between lies a catalogue of many of Indra’s famous, and not  so famous, deeds—though avoiding the most famous of these, the Vala and Vr̥tra  myths (save in the repeated epithet “Vr̥tra-smasher,” vss. 1, 19, 22). The most  detailed treatments are of Indra’s theft of the Sun’s wheel (vss. 4–6) and the smash
ing of Dawn’s cart (vss. 8–11), myths whose contents are not entirely clear to us,  despite regular allusions to them. Both myths are also treated in X.138, and as in  that hymn (see introductory remarks there), we see in both myths a reflection of  Indra’s assertion of control over cosmic time by deregulating it, at least temporar
ily. This theme seems to be announced in verse 3c, immediately preceding the story  of the Sun’s wheel.
The other deeds are related in cursory fashion, one per verse, and the abundance  of forms of utá “and” emphasizes the additive nature of the hymn, especially in its  second part. In this it resembles the catalogue hymns devoted to the Aśvins’ rescues  and favors to men.
### 1
There is no one higher than you, Indra, and no one superior, o
Vr̥tra-smasher—
no one who is exactly as you are.
### 2
Altogether do the peoples turn, like wheels, following all things that  are yours.
Altogether are you famed as great.
### 3
Not even all the gods (altogether) fought you, Indra, because of this: that by night you passed over the days.
### 4
When, for those hard pressed and for Kutsa as he fought,
you stole the wheel from the Sun, o Indra;
### 5
When you fought the swaggering gods, all of them, even though you  were alone,
and you smashed the rapacious ones, o Indra;
### 6
And when for the mortal you let the Sun slip,
and you helped Etaśa through your powers.
### 7
And after that are you (still) the one best possessed of battle fury, o  bounteous smasher of obstacles?
At that time you passed over Dānu (lying there),
### 8
And you performed this manly and masculine deed, Indra:
that you smote a woman, the evilly angry daughter of Heaven.
### 9
The daughter of Heaven: though she was honored as great, you,  the great,
crushed Dawn completely.
### 10
Dawn ran away in fear from her cart, which was completely crushed, when the bull jabbed it down.
### 11
This cart of hers lies, very completely crushed, here at the Vipāś (River). She has run into the far distance. 12. And the River Vibālī, which had spread out upon the earth,
did you hem in, Indra, by your magic power.
### 13
And you boldly seized the possessions of Śuṣṇa,
when you completely crushed his fortresses.
### 14
And you struck Śambara, the Dāsa son of Kulitara,
down from the lofty mountain, Indra.
### 15
And you smote the hundreds and thousands (of men) of the Dāsa  Varcin,
and five in addition, like the outer parts of wheels.
### 16
And to this unwed girl’s son, who had been shunned, did Indra of a  hundred resolves
give a share in the recitations.
### 17
And these two, Turvaśa and Yadu, who could not swim, did the lord of  powers,
the knowing Indra, bring to the far shore.
### 18
And these two Āryas, Arṇa and Citraratha, did you strike at the  same time
to the far side of the Sarayu (River), o Indra.
### 19
You led along the two that had been abandoned, the blind man and the  lame, o Vr̥tra-smasher:
that favor of yours is not to be equaled.
### 20
Indra threw open the hundred fortresses made of stone
for the pious Divodāsa.
### 21
For Dabhīti, Indra “put to sleep” with his blows thirty thousand Dāsas by his magic power.
### 22
And you are that same herdsman, o Indra, Vr̥tra-smasher,
who set all these things in motion.
### 23
And now what masculine deed worthy of Indra you will do, o Indra, that no one shall thwart today.
### 24
Let the god Aryaman give everything of value to you, o Āduri— Pūṣan a valuable, Bhaga a valuable, the gap-toothed god a valuable.

Vāmadeva Gautama
15 verses: gāyatrī, probably arranged in trcas ̥
Indra’s help to us, in its manifold varieties, is a major subject in the hymn, which  opens with a question about this help and regularly returns to the topic (vss. 3,  10, 12, 13). Because Indra’s presence is required in order for us to receive his help,
606 IV.31
the hymn is also framed as a journey/invitation hymn. The second verse asks  which soma drink will most appeal to Indra, a semi-disguised expression of the  usual worry that Indra will be attracted by rival pressers. This worry seems also to  underlie the difficult second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6), with its condensed phraseology. Here  the poet first calls on Indra to come here (vs. 4), then seems (in our interpreta
tion at least) to chide him slightly for tarrying (vs. 5), but finally announces (vs.  6) that Indra has arrived with both high spirits and equipment. (The references  to the sun in vss. 5 and 6 are opaque, but we tentatively suggest that they refer to  the early-morning soma sacrifice.) In the next tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) the poet seems reas
sured: despite Indra’s wide-ranging travels his generosity never flags and nothing  gets in its way.
In contrast to the middle verses 4–9, the last two tr̥cas (vss. 10–15) are quite  straightforward and characterized by the insistent fronting of the pronoun “us/ our,” which opens every verse, as well as several intermediate pādas (10bc, 12c). The  message is simple: help us and give to us in every way possible, ending with a wish  for fame among the gods, fame higher than heaven itself (vs. 15).
### 1
With what help will our brilliant, ever-strengthening comrade be there  for us—
with what most powerful troop?
### 2
Which trusty one among the exhilarating drinks, which most bounteous  one from the soma-stalk will exhilarate you
to break loose good things, even though they are held fast?
### 3
As the helper of us, your comrades and your singers,
you will prevail by your hundred means of help.
### 4
Turn toward us here—like a chariot-wheel turned toward its steeds— with your teams of the separate peoples.
### 5
For through the days you come here along the slope of your intentions,  as if by foot.
I have taken my share in company with the sun(rise).
### 6
Since your battle-frenzies, o Indra, since your chariot-wheels have  converged (here),
(I have taken my share) sometimes in (company with) you and sometimes  in (company with) the Sun.
### 7
And because it is just you they always call a bounteous one, o lord  of power,
a giver who never thinks twice,
### 8
And (you) always (circle) around (the peoples? realms?) in a single day;  on the laboring presser
you bounteously bestow many goods.
### 9
For not even a hundred hindrances can block your generosity,
nor your exploits when you will do them. 10. Let your hundred means of help help us, us your thousand,
us all your superior powers.
### 11
Choose us here for comradeship, for well-being,
for great, heavenly wealth.
### 12
Help us through all the days with wealth in profusion, o Indra— us with all your means of help.
### 13
For us open up these pens filled with cattle, as a sharpshooter (would), with your new means of help, o Indra.
### 14
Our brilliant chariot, not to be diverted, boldly
speeds in its search for cattle and horses, o Indra.
### 15
Our fame—make it most preeminent among the gods, o Sun,
and highest, as if above heaven.

32 (328) Indra
Vāmadeva Gautama
24 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
This long final hymn of the Indra cycle of Maṇḍala IV is, in contrast to the earlier  hymns in this cycle, quite straightforward for most of its length. The poet urges  Indra to come to us, with help and gifts, and promises praises of his great deeds  (though the celebration of his specific deeds within the hymn is cursory—consisting  of part of vs. 10) and oblations.
Toward the end of the hymn, the requests for gifts become specific (esp. the tr̥ca  of vss. 17–19) and somewhat peremptory (see esp. vs. 20). These verses (17–21)  have the “feel” of a dānastuti, though they are without doubt addressed to Indra.  The real dānastuti occupies the last tr̥ca (vss. 22–24), though the praise of Indra’s  gifts in the preceding verses obviously serves as model for the human patron. These  last three verses, and especially the middle verse 23, are quite opaque and, like  many dānastutis, contain slangy expressions and words belonging to a different,  and lower, linguistic register. All three verses praise “the two brown ones,” and the  first of the verses announces itself as a formal praśasti (panegyric), with the verbal  lexeme prá...śáṃsāmi. The referent of the two brown ones is unclear. The default  assumption is horses, but the very peculiar verse 23 casts considerable doubt on  this interpretation. We will not rehearse here the many strained interpretations of  verse 23 (among which are some that concern puppets, some eyeballs) and simply  provide our own. We suggest that the “two brown ones” are the two breasts of a  woman given to the poet as a gift (along with cows and the like). (For what we take  as similar praise of a gift-woman’s breasts in a dānastuti, see VIII.2.42.) In verse 23  the poet compares the now-bared breasts to dolls on a post (the slender trunk of the  woman, presumably), and the travels he refers to in verses 23–24 are, in our inter pretation, their movements during sex. Although this interpretation is not entirely
608 IV.32
secure, the competing interpretations are even less so, and the prurient nature of  our suggested contents would fit the marked linguistic register of the dānastuti.
### 1
Come here to us, o Indra Vr̥tra-smasher, here to our side,
as the great one with great means of help.
### 2
You are a whirlwind, constantly lunging. O brilliant one, you put the  brilliance
in the brilliant (females [=means of help?]) right here, for our help.
### 3
With only a few you smash the more numerous overweening (force)  with your power,
with the comrades who are in company with you.
### 4
We in company with you, Indra—we keep bellowing to you:
“Help us, only us!”
### 5
Come here to us, o master of the stone, with your brilliant means  of help,
which cannot be faulted or challenged.
### 6
Might we be comrades of one like you, Indra, possessed of cows, and be your yokemates for the sake of the thrilling prize.
### 7
Since you alone, Indra, are master of the prize possessed of cows, offer us great refreshment.
### 8
They cannot deflect you to another way, when, praised, you wish to  give bounty
to the praisers, o Indra longing for songs.
### 9
The Gotamas have bellowed to you with their song, for you to give the thrilling prize, Indra.
### 10
We shall proclaim your heroic deeds: that you in your exhilaration  broke into
the Dāsa fortresses, after having attacked them.
### 11
The ritual masters sing these deeds of yours—the manly deeds that you  performed—
at their pressings, o Indra longing for songs.
### 12
The Gotamas, whose vehicle is praise, have become strengthened in  your company, Indra.
On them confer glory in heroes.
### 13
Even though you are the support common to each and every one, Indra, we summon you to us.
### 14
Become inclined toward us, o good one. Among us achieve exhilaration  from the stalk,
o Indra, soma-drinker of the soma-juices.
### 15
Let the praise song of our thoughts guide you here, Indra.
Turn your two fallow bays this way. 16. Our offering cake you shall eat, and you shall take pleasure in
our songs,
as a bride-seeking man does a maiden.
### 17
We beg Indra for a thousand paired horses in harness,
for a hundred measures of soma.
### 18
Let us get hundreds and thousands of your cows driven here.
Let your largesse come among us.
### 19
We have acquired ten tubs of golden (goods).
You are the giver of much, o Vr̥tra-smasher.
### 20
O giver of much, give much to us. Not a little!—bring much here. Surely it is much that you want to give, o Indra.
### 21
Since you are famed in many places as the giver of much, o champion,  Vr̥tra-smasher,
give us a share in your largesse.
### 22
I solemnly proclaim the two brown ones of yours, o far-gazing
grandson of the Goṣan.
(But) with (the gift of) these two, don’t slack off on (the giving of) cows! 23. Like two little baby-dolls on a post—the two new little ones,
undressed—
the two brown ones go in beauty on their travels.

Ready for me when I travel at dawn, ready (for me) when I don’t, the two brown ones don’t falter on their travels.

33 (329) R̥bhus
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
This is one of the most interesting of the R̥bhu hymns and one of the most sig nificant for the interpretation of the R̥bhus. The R̥bhus are gods, but they are also  priests, and much of the hymn refers to their work as sacrificial performers in the  third soma pressing, the pressing with which they are associated (cf. vs. 11). This  sacrificial work is sometimes directly expressed (e.g., vss. 2ab, 3cd, 9), but most  often it is described in mythic narrative. For example, while verse 4 has been contro versial, it likely refers to a distinctive rite of the Third Pressing in which the soma  stalks already used in the first two pressings are beaten again to extract the soma  juice for the Third Pressing. The “cow” that one R̥bhu tends is the soma stalks,  which are thoroughly mangled or “carved” in the pressing and then “carried” away.  Because the R̥bhus prepared the soma or perhaps even created the Third Pressing,  they “attained immortality” and became gods. This leaves unexplained the verse’s
610 IV.33
repeated reference to the “year,” but perhaps the year represents the sacrificial day  or even the period of the Third Pressing.
The next verses (5–6) describe the institution of the Third Pressing. The princi pal soma recipients in the Third Pressing are Indra and the three R̥bhus. The four  soma cups that the R̥bhus construct from the one made by Tvaṣṭar thus represent  the four soma recipients and the extension of the soma rite into the Third Pressing.  Unfortunately, the narrative returns to deeper obscurity in verse 7. The story of  the R̥bhus and Agohya occurs in other R̥bhu hymns (I.110.2–3 and 161.11–12),  but none of the hymns provides enough information to know who Agohya is or  the significance of the R̥bhus’ slumber in the house of Agohya. If there is a ritual  reference here, it may be to an Atirātra or overnight soma rite, in which the Third  Pressing is extended through the night into the next day. If that is the case, then  the poet could be conflating different units of time as in verse 4, and the “twelve  days” they remained with Agohya could be the hours of the night. One possibility  is that Agohya is Savitar (cf. I.110.2–3), and that identification too would point to  the night since Savitar is associated with the night. In verse 8 the “smooth running”  chariot that stands still may be the sacrifice, elsewhere compared to a chariot, but  the “all-rousing milk-cow of all shapes” remains elusive.
Although there is significant competition for this honor, perhaps the most obscure  of the stories is that of the R̥bhus’ rejuvenation of their parents (vss. 2–3ab). Their  parents could be the sacrificer and his wife, who has an important ritual role in the  Third Pressing and whose sexual power is a theme of that pressing. Or they could  even be the two Aśvins, who in the classical soma rite are invoked in the morning fol
lowing an overnight soma rite. The word pitárā, though understood here and usually  as an elliptical dual referring to father and mother, can mean “two fathers,” perhaps  an oblique reference to the Aśvins. The Aśvins are part of the Morning Pressing and  their reappearance at the end of the rite could constitute a kind of rejuvenation.
The difficulties in the interpretation of the narratives in this hymn are reflected  in some of the language of the hymns, especially at its beginning and end. The first  verse imitates the clever artisanship of the R̥bhus by its own verbal intricacy. In  pāda c the phrase taráṇibhir évaiḥ could be translated “along their transiting ways”  and mean that the R̥bhus move actually or figuratively along the courses that cross  heaven. But taráṇi can also mean “surpassing,” and therefore the phrase might also  refer to the “surpassing” ritual skill of the R̥bhus by which they encompass heaven.  With equal justification, therefore, we could translate “(The R̥bhus,) sped by the  wind, by their surpassing ways have encompassed heaven....” Pāda b interrupts  and separates pāda a from cd, which continue it. In pāda b it is not clear what the  “śvaitarī cow” is—it could be a kind of cow as Geldner suggests—but śvaítarī car ries or suggests the sense of “gleaming white” and points to the identification of  the cow as milk. If the priest has just drunk it, milk might form an underlayer of  his speech, which he then offers to the gods. The infinitive upastíre “to spread an  underlayer” evokes the upastáraṇa, the underlayer of butter that accompanies a  puroḍāśá or barley cake offering. The last verse has a different kind of complexity. Pāda b begins ná r̥té śrāntásya,  and the problem particularly involves the word r̥té. The simplest and most common  reading is to translate r̥té as “except,” but it would then normally govern an ablative  noun and there is none to be had. Our suggestion is that there is an ellipsis of an abla
tive sakhyā́t “companionship.” But further, we also suggest that r̥té is a śleṣa, a pun,  and means not only “except,” but also “in the truth,” that is, “according to the proper  order of the sacrifice.” In this sense the word is construed with śrāntá “labored.” To try  to capture the double meaning, we have translated the word twice in these two senses.
### 1
To the R̥bhus I send forth my speech like a messenger—I call upon the  śvaitarī milk-cow to spread an underlayer (for it)—
to the artisans who, sped by the wind along their transiting ways, have  encompassed heaven in a day.
### 2
When the R̥bhus made fit preparations for their parents by their  attentiveness, industry, and wondrous skills,
right then they came into companionship with the gods. Clever, they  brought prosperity to their zeal.
### 3
They who made their parents, lying aged like two old posts,
youths again—
let them—Vāja, Vibhvan, and R̥bhu together with Indra—delighting in  the honeyed (soma), help our sacrifice.
### 4
When the R̥bhus guarded the cow through the year, when the R̥bhus  carved the meat through the year,
when they carried her leavings through the year, they attained
immortality by these labors.
### 5
The eldest said, “I will make two cups (from one).” The younger said,  “We will make three.”
The youngest said, “I will make four.” O R̥bhus, Tvaṣṭar wondered at  that speech of yours.
### 6
The noble men spoke the truth, for they did exactly that. According to  their will, the R̥bhus followed that (will of theirs).
Having seen the four cups, Tvaṣṭar gazed at them, bright shining
like days.
### 7
When the R̥bhus enjoyed the hospitality of Agohya for twelve days,  sleeping (there),
(then) they made the fields good and led the rivers; plants arose upon the  dry land and waters upon the low ground.
### 8
Who made the chariot smooth running and standing still for men, who  (made) the all-rousing milk-cow of all shapes—
let these R̥bhus fashion wealth for us, they of good help, good work, and  good hands.
### 9
Because the gods were pleased at their work, reflecting on it according to  their purpose and with their thought,
612 IV.34
Vāja became the doer of right action for the gods, R̥bhukṣan for Indra,  and Vibhvan for Varuṇa.
### 10
They who by their wisdom, finding exhilaration in the hymns, made the  two fallow bays for Indra, they who made his easily hitched horses— you!—establish for us possessions and the prospering of wealth.
Establish an alliance (with us), R̥bhus, like those dwelling in peace.
### 11
At this time of the day they have established drink and exhilaration for  you. The gods are not in companionship (with men) except (for their  companionship) with him who has labored in the truth.
Now, o R̥bhus, establish good things for us at this Third Pressing.
## 34 
34 (330) R̥bhus
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is built upon an urgent appeal that the R̥bhus and Indra reward and  prosper the sacrificers. That desire is expressed especially in the repetitions of the  noun ratnadhéya “the conferring of treasure” and adjective ratnadhá/-dhā́ “con ferring treasure.” Ratnadhéya (1b, 4a, 11d) occurs in the first and last verses and  thereby frames the hymn; ratnadhá/-dhā́ (6d, 7d, 8d) is in the opening verses of the  second half of the hymn. This repetition is amplified by the closely related phrases  rayíṃ √dhā “confer riches” (10b) and rātíṃ √dhā “confer a gift” (10d), in the final  verse before the extra-hymnic concluding verse 11.
Such word and sound repetition is a broader strategy of this poet. So pādas 5a,  5c, and 6a all begin with ā́ “here” and their following pādas open with an m-sound  and repeat nasals, while using relatively few stops: 5b mahó naro dráviṇaso gr̥ṇānā́ḥ,  5d imā́ ástaṃ navasvà iva gman, 6b imáṃ yajñáṃ námasā hūyámānāḥ. The result is  a humming sound reminiscent of stotra chants in the classical Vedic rite. Then 6c,  7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 8c, and 8d begin with forms of sajóṣas “together” to emphasize the  collectivity of gods who receive the soma. And finally, in a mirroring of verses 5–6,  pādas 9a, 9c, and 10a begin with yé “who.”
Implicit in the hymn is an insistence that the R̥bhus, even if they were once mor tals, are now gods, able to bestow gifts on the sacrificers. Verse 3 defines their dual  status as divine recipients of soma and as priests who offered soma. The sacrifice  belongs to them, for as priests “like Manu” they long ago offered the sacrifice, but  they also received it as gods. They are called sūrí “patrons” (6c), a term that can apply  to sacrificers or to gods who reward the priests of the sacrifice. In 11cd the R̥bhus are  invoked to receive the soma together with unnamed kings, who again could be divine  or human. But the poet places particular emphasis on their divinity. The linking of  the R̥bhus with Indra, especially at the beginning and end of the hymn (1a, 5a, 6c,  11c), more than just names the principal divine recipients at the Third Pressing; it also reaffirms the divinity of the R̥bhus through their close relationship to Indra. In verses  7–8 the poet directly addresses Indra and invites him to drink the soma together with  many of the other deities who receive offerings at the soma pressings, and then adds  the R̥bhus (8b) to his address and to these divinities. The poet even creates an icon of  their achievement of divinity. The one time in this hymn that they are directly called  gods is the very last word of the last verse, which forms a climax to the hymn.
One final note:  at the beginning of the hymn, the poet names the three  R̥bhus: R̥bhu, Vibhvan, and Vāja. Normally, the three together are called R̥bhus,  of course, but elsewhere and here they can also be invoked by elliptical plurals of  either of the other two names. In this hymn they are called Vājas in successive verses  (3d, 4c, and 5a), an address likely inspired by the epithet vā́jaratna “whose treasure  is victory’s prize” in verse 2. In 9d they are called Vibhūs, obviously patterning with  Vibhvan. In the first half of verse 9 the poet associates the name “R̥bhu” with the  gods’ typical deeds: they created a chariot for the Aśvins, rejuvenated their par ents, and fashioned a cow and two horses. As noted before, most of these deeds  refer to priestly action, since the chariot can be the sacrifice, the parents either the  Aśvins themselves or the sacrificer and his wife, the cow the soma stalks, and the  two horses the horses that bring Indra to the sacrificial area. In 9cd the poet uses the  name “Vibhū” (or the form may be “Vibhu”) and the deeds he describes are more  unusual. The R̥bhus do not elsewhere make armor, so the significance of this story  is obscure. The other two deeds echo the plea for prosperity. As Geldner has noted,  Yāska understands ŕ̥dhak both in the sense of “separate” (pr̥thak) and “prospering”  (r̥dhnuvan). The first is the proper meaning of ŕ̥dhak, but if the second is suggested  by the word’s similarity to √r̥dh “prosper,” then the verse implies that the Vibhūs  both create and prosper the sacrificer’s world.
### 1
Let R̥bhu, Vibhvan, Vāja, and Indra travel here toward this our sacrifice  and toward their conferring of treasure (here),
for at this time of the day [=evening] the goddess Holy Place has placed  the drink (of soma) for you. The exhilarating draughts have gathered  for you.
### 2
And knowing of your origin, o you whose treasure is victory’s prize, find  exhilaration according to the ritual sequences, o R̥bhus.
The exhilarating draughts have gathered for you, (as has) Plenitude. Send  here a wealth of good heroes for us.

R̥bhus, this sacrifice now has been made for you, which you, like Manu,  established for yourselves from of old.
Those (draughts of soma), giving pleasure, have come forth for you here,  and you all have come to the fore (to receive them), o Vājas.
### 4
Now there has come to be the conferring of treasure for him honoring  you, for the pious mortal, o fine men.
Drink, o Vājas, o R̥bhus! The great Third Pressing has been given to you  for your exhilaration.614 IV.35
### 5
Travel here toward us, o Vājas, o Master of the R̥bhus [=Indra] and  R̥bhus, o you fine men of great possessions, since you are being sung  (by us).
These (soma-)draughts have come here for you in the evening of the  day, as newly calved (cows come) home.
### 6
O children of strength, travel here toward this sacrifice, being
summoned with reverence.
Together, o patrons and (the one) to whom you belong [=Indra], drink  of the honey [=soma] along with Indra, as those who confer treasure. 7. Together with Varuṇa, o Indra, (drink) the soma. Together with the  Maruts, drink the soma, o you longing for the songs.
With those drinking first, with those drinking in ritual sequence, (drink)  together; with the Wives (of the Gods) conferring treasure, (drink)
together.
### 8
Together with the Ādityas become exhilarated; o R̥bhus, together with  the mountains;
together with the divine Savitar; together with the rivers, conferring
treasure.
### 9
The R̥bhus, who (did for) the two Aśvins and who (did for) their  parents, who fashioned the cow through their help, who the two
horses;
the Vibhūs, who (made) the armor (of the gods?), who (made) the
two world-halves to be separated, and who have done (the deeds)
bringing good descendants,
### 10
You who confer riches abundant in cattle, in prizes of victory, in good  heroes, in goods, and in much livestock—
o R̥bhus, as those drinking first and finding exhilaration, confer your  gift on us and (on those) who sing of it.
### 11
You have not kept away. We have not let you be thirsty, o R̥bhus, nor are  you unpraised in this sacrifice.
You become exhilarated along with Indra, along with the Maruts, and  along with kings for the sake of your conferring of wealth, o gods.

35 (331) R̥bhus
Vāmadeva Gautama
9 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins by addressing the R̥bhus with a patronymic Saudhanvan “sons  of Sudhanvan.” This use of the patronymic and thus the emphasis on their birth  accents their original humanity. But through their ritual work, they “went along  the path of immortality” and so entered the community of gods (3cd). The poet returns to this theme also at the end of the hymn in verse 8.  He states that the  R̥bhus became gods through their work (8a) and recalls that they were human— once again through addressing them with their patronymic—before they became  immortal (8d). The concluding verse then invites the divine R̥bhus together with  Indra to receive the soma at the Third Pressing.
In the middle section of the hymn the poet mentions several of the R̥bhus’ great  deeds (vs. 5), but his focus is on their act of dividing one soma cup into four (vss.  2–4). According to this hymn, Indra alone is the recipient of soma in the Midday  Pressing, but Indra and the three R̥bhus are the principal soma recipients in the  evening (vs. 7). The creation of four cups from one thus marks the transition from  the single soma offering to Indra at midday to the four offerings in the evening and  the institution of the Third Pressing.
### 1
Travel here, children of strength! Do not keep away, o R̥bhus, sons of  Sudhanvan,
for in this pressing the conferring of treasure is yours. Let your
exhilarating draughts follow after Indra.
### 2
The R̥bhus’ conferring of treasure has come here; the drinking of  well-pressed soma has become (yours),
since by your good work and your good labor you divided the single cup  fourfold.
### 3
You divided the cup fourfold; you said, “O companion, work to cut it  apart!”
Then, o Vājas, you went along the path of the immortality to the throng  of gods, o R̥bhus of skilled hands.
### 4
Of what was this cup made, which you divided into four by your artistry? Now then press the soma-pressing for your exhilaration; drink of the  soma-honey, o R̥bhus!
### 5
By your ability you have made your parents to be young; by your ability  you have made the cup from which the gods drink.
By your ability you fashioned the two swift-running fallow bays that  convey Indra, o R̥bhus whose treasure is victory’s prize.
### 6
Who presses for you in the evening of the day the sharp pressing for  exhilaration, o Vājas,
for him, o R̥bhus, fashion wealth that consist of hale heroes since you  find exhilaration, o bulls.
### 7
In the early morning you drank the pressed soma, o you with the fallow  bays [=Indra]; the Midday Pressing is yours alone.
Drink together with the treasure-conferring R̥bhus, whom you made  your companions by their good work.
### 8
You who became gods by your good work—settle down upon heaven like  falcons!
Confer treasure, o children of strength! O sons of Sudhanvan, you
became immortal.
616 IV.36
### 9
The Third Pressing, the conferring of treasure, which you made by your  good labor, o you of skillful hands,
that is poured all around here for you, o R̥bhus. Drink it along with the  exhilarating draughts belonging to Indra!

36 (332) R̥bhus
Vāmadeva Gautama
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 9
The first half of this hymn turns on the “proclamation” of the divinity of the R̥bhus  and of their deeds (vss. 1, 3, 5) and the second on the prosperity they bring. The  first verse already establishes the central themes of the hymn. The chariot with three  wheels that rolls through space is likely the ritual with its three fires or possibly with  its three soma-pressings. And just as the ritual flies from earth to heaven, so the  R̥bhus prosper both earth and heaven.
The ritual is key to the R̥bhus, since it is through their ritual acts that they became  divine, and they continue to perform ritual acts, even as divinities. Verse 2 again refers  to their perfect chariot—the perfect ritual that the R̥bhus carried out through their  insight. Because they rode to heaven on that ritual, they are now offered soma at the  Third Pressing (2cd). Verses 3–4 rehearse three of the well-known deeds of the R̥bhus,  which are united by a sonic repetition: they rejuvenate their parents in order for them  “to keep going” (caráthāya); in order to make the four principal soma offerings at the  Third Pressing they “divided” one “cup into four” (ví cakra camasáṃ cáturvayam); and  “out of a cowhide” (cármaṇaḥ) they made a milk-giving cow. The cowhide in 4b may  be a hide on which the stalks of the soma plant are beaten (the adhiṣavaṇacarman)  to produce the soma juice. Since at the Third Pressing the stalks used in the first two  pressings are beaten again to extract the soma juice, therefore the great deed of the  R̥bhus might have been that they were able to extract more soma juice on the cowhide  from old stalks and in that way make the cowhide into a cow once again, who gives  soma as its milk. Or the cowhide may refer to the soma stalks themselves, the shredded  remains of the previous pressings that are made to yield soma once again.
In the second half of the hymn (vss. 5–9) the poet turns principally to the rewards  that the R̥bhus bring. The poet announces the theme in verse 5 by proclaiming that  those whom the R̥bhus help have “wide boundaries”—broad horizons, we might  say. Great men, whether poets or warriors, are great because of the R̥bhus (vs. 6),  and through the R̥bhus people gain wealth (5a, 6c, 8d), vigor (8d), fame (5a, 9bc),  and descendants (9a).
### 1
Produced without horse and rein, the praiseworthy chariot with its three  wheels rolls through the airy space.
This is the great proclamation of your divinity: that you prosper heaven  and earth, o R̥bhus. 2. The very perceptive ones who made from mind by insight the
smooth-running chariot, which never overturns—
(to you,) o Vājas, o R̥bhus, we now dedicate (the soma) of this pressing  for you to drink.
### 3
Your greatness became well proclaimed among the gods, o Vājas, R̥bhus,  and Vibhūs:
that you fashion your parents as youths for them to keep going, even  though they were enfeebled, worn out by age.
### 4
You divided the single cup into four; out of a cowhide you made a cow to  flow (milk) by your insights.
So then you attained immortality among the gods by your obedience, o  Vājas, R̥bhus: that is your praiseworthy (attainment).
### 5
From the R̥bhus comes wealth that best brings the foremost fame, which  the men famed as Vājas have produced,
that is fashioned by the Vibhvans, that is to be proclaimed at the ritual  distributions. Whom you help, o gods, he has wide boundaries.
### 6
He is a prizewinning charger; he a seer through his verbal artfulness; he a  champion, an archer, who is difficult to overcome in battles;
he has received an increase of his wealth and he an abundance of good  heroes—he, whom Vāja and Vibhvan, whom the R̥bhus have helped. 7. An excellent, beautiful robe has been placed upon you: (this) song of  praise, o Vājas, R̥bhus. Take pleasure in it!
Because you are insightful poets perceiving inspired words, we dedicate  (it) to you with this formulation.
### 8
You who know all the things that nourish men, for us (fashion) from the  Holy Places [=the ritual ground]
the highest heavenly prize that brings the explosiveness of a bull; fashion  for us wealth and vitality, o R̥bhus.
### 9
Giving offspring here and wealth here, fashion here for us the fame that  heroes accompany.
The bright prize by which we would be brilliant beyond others, o R̥bhus,  have you given to us.
## 37 
37 (333) R̥bhus
Vāmadeva Gautama
8 verses: triṣṭubh 1–4, anuṣṭubh 5–8
Meter divides this hymn into two parts: the first half is in trimeter and the second in  dimeter. That might indicate that the two parts were originally two different hymns,  but the two parts show a thematic unity. Running through the hymn is the explicit  and implicit image of the horse, although the meaning of the horse is constantly
618 IV.37
changing. The first verse does not mention a horse, but it invites the R̥bhus to come  in their chariots to the sacrifice, so the horse implicitly carries the R̥bhus. In 4a the  bahuvrīhi pī́voaśva might mean “(having) fat horses,” but we have taken it to refer to  the butter offerings belonging to the R̥bhus, and therefore we have translated “(hav
ing) horses of fat,” just as the R̥bhus’ “blazing chariots” in the bahuvrīhi śucádratha likely refers to the sacrificial fires. In 4b the R̥bhus themselves are addressed as prize winning horses. The theme then becomes more pronounced in the second half of the  hymn. In verse 5b they are summoned as a team of horses, and in 5d at least one of  them is called a horseman. In verse 6 the sacrificer’s horse, here probably the hymn,  is a steed that makes him a winner. And finally in verse 8 the wealth that the R̥bhus  bring may be a horse, but this verse is problematic and discussed in more detail below.
One of the lexical features of the hymn is the wording of the invocation to the  Vājas and R̥bhukṣans. These are elliptical plurals. The “Vājas” refers to all three  R̥bhus, who are most commonly named R̥bhu, Vāja, and Vibhvan. “R̥bhukṣan,”  which means “Master of the R̥bhus,” can refer to Indra, but it can also be a  name for one of the R̥bhus, that is, the R̥bhu who is named “R̥bhu.” The plural  R̥bhukṣans here, therefore, are probably again just the three R̥bhus. In verse 5  the poet encodes two R̥bhus in the appellative use of their names: R̥bhu in R̥bhú “craftsman” (5a) and Vāja in vā́ja “prize” (5b). The name of the third R̥bhu,  Vibhvan or Vibhū, does not appear in this verse, or anywhere else in the hymn.  However, he may be the horseman (aśvín) in 5cd, for horses are “wide-ranging”  (vibhú), as in III.6.9b vibhávo hí áśvāḥ “for your horses are wide-ranging.” The  word aśvínam also anticipates the invocation of the Nāsatyas, that is, the Aśvins,  in verse 8. The addition of the Aśvins may point to the use of this hymn in an  Atirātra or Overnight Soma Rite, since in that rite the Aśvins are summoned in  the early morning after the soma-pressing day.
Verse 3 poses some difficulty because tryudā́ya, here translated “thrice ascend ing,” is a hapax of unsure meaning. Perhaps wisely, Geldner does not try translating  it at all. Sāyaṇa links tri- “three” to the three soma pressings, but the R̥bhus do not  receive soma at the Morning or Midday Pressings. Therefore, while -udā́ya likely  does describe soma pressing (sávana), tri- may refer to three soma offerings to the  three R̥bhus.
But the most problematic verse is the last, and our interpretation is tentative.  The verse appears to refer to a Horse Sacrifice. In the classical rite the horse is  released to wander through various territories before it is finally sacrificed. Here  the horse is the wealth that the R̥bhus, Indra, and the Aśvins bring from surround
ing lands. As the sacrificial horse is slaughtered and cut up, so wealth is generously  apportioned to the sacrificers.
### 1
Travel toward our rite, o Vājas, o R̥bhukṣans, you gods, along the paths  the gods travel,
just as you established the sacrifice for yourselves among these clans of  Manu on a clear day of days, o you who bring joy. 2. Let the sacrifices be (pleasing) to your heart and mind: pleasing, they go  today clothed in ghee.
The full pressings will give you joy, and when drunk, they will inspire  you to determination and skill.
### 3
Just as the thrice ascending (soma-pressing) has been established by the  gods for you and the praise song has been given to you, o Vājas, o
R̥bhukṣans,
I, like Manu, offer the soma among the clans below [=humans] to you  together with the (clans) of lofty heaven [=gods].
### 4
Be those with horses of fat and blazing chariots, with lips of bronze and  fine neck-ornaments, o you prizewinners!
O son of Indra and children of strength, the first (of the soma) has been  assigned to you for your exhilaration.
### 5
O R̥bhukṣans, we summon the craftsman who is wealth, the team of best  prizewinning horses at (the contest for) the prize, and,
together with Indra, the horseman who is always best at winning.
### 6
The mortal whom you and Indra help, o R̥bhus—
through his insights, let just him be a winner in winning wisdom and let  him (be a winner) with his steed.
### 7
For us clear away paths (to enable us) to sacrifice, o Vājas, o R̥bhukṣans, in order (for us) to cross all regions, since you are praised, o patrons. 8. (Cut up) that wealth for us, o Vājas, R̥bhukṣans, Indra, and Nāsatyas, (which is the sacrificial) horse from the border lands. Cut it up
abundantly to give (us) bounties.

38 (334) Heaven and Earth (1), Dadhikrā (2–10)
Vāmadeva Gautama
10 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn and the next two (IV.39–40) are dedicated to a horse known as  Dadhikrā(van), a prizewinning racer and a warhorse. Although no doubt in part  referring to a real horse belonging to Trasadasyu, king of the Pūrus, it also repre sents the sacrificial horse of the great royal sacrifice, the Aśvamedha, and a symbol  of Pūru, and then general Ārya, hegemony. In this capacity it is compared to the  sun, in the last, triumphal verse.
What the reader will notice most, however, is the exuberance and precision of  the equine imagery, emphasizing especially the headlong speed of the horse and his  constant goal: groups of female animals, presumably mares. The sense of speed is  enhanced by the regular use of “and” to string verses together; indeed, the hymn  begins with one. Unfortunately some of the imagery is not entirely clear; see espe
cially verse 4, where some of the translation is provisional.
620 IV.38
Although the Anukramaṇī assigns the first verse to Heaven and Earth, it is more  likely that Mitra and Varuṇa are the referents of the unspecified duals.
### 1
And since the earlier gifts were from you two [=Mitra and Varuṇa], the  ones that Trasadasyu was to send spilling down for the Pūrus,
you have (also) given the one [=horse] who wins dwelling places, who  wins meadows, a bane for the Dasyus, overwhelming, powerful.
### 2
And a prizewinner providing many fulfillments have you given— Dadhikrā, who belongs to all the communities,
a straight-flying falcon, frothing at the mouth, swift, to be constantly  celebrated by the stranger, a champion like a lord of men.
### 3
The one whom every Pūru applauds in excitement as he runs as if down  an easy slope—
greedy with his hooves like a champion seeking his meal, outstripping  chariots, swooping like the wind.
### 4
The one who, hemming in the things to be seized in battles, keeps going  to (the contests for) cows as one better at winning,
foaming visibly, setting his attention on the (rites of) distribution,
across the circlet (of fire? the sun?), around the waters of Āyu.
### 5
And the settled peoples shriek after him at his raidings as if after a thief  who steals clothes,
as he makes his way downward like a famished falcon toward fame and  a herd full of livestock.
### 6
And desiring to run first, he keeps bearing down upon them (fem.  [=mares?]), with the ranks of chariots,
garlanding himself like a resplendent groomsman, constantly licking  the dust, having bitten the grit.
### 7
And this prizewinner, victorious, truthful, himself seeking fame with his  own body in the clash,
hastening headlong toward them (fem. [=mares?]) as they go hastily,  straight-flying, scatters dust up to the eyebrows as he stretches out
straight.
### 8
And they take fear at his charge as he shows his mettle, as if at the  thundering of heaven.
When a thousand have battled him, the fearsome one becomes difficult  to obstruct, as he stretches out straight.
### 9
And the peoples admire the speed of him who fills the territories, the  superiority of the swift one.
And they say about him as they disperse at the encounter: “Dadhikrā has run away with thousands.”
### 10
Dadhikrā has stretched over the five peoples with his vast power, like  the sun over the waters with its light.
Gaining thousands, gaining hundreds, let the prizewinning steed infuse  these words with honey.

Vāmadeva Gautama
6 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 6
In this celebratory hymn the very real and physical horse of the preceding hymn  (IV.38) has become a mere recipient of and occasion for a formal encomium. He is  invoked along with a number of gods and thus appears to have achieved a measure  of divinity, but the artistry of IV.38 has been replaced by the deployment of stiff  and conventional formulae. It is, however, interesting to see how an encomium of  this sort, presumably a particular type of occasional verse, would be constructed.
### 1
The swift Dadhikrā—him will we now praise, and we will pay tribute to  Heaven and to Earth.
Let the Dawns, dawning, sweeten me. They will lead me across all
difficult passages.
### 2
Fulfilling my conception, I pay tribute to the great steed, to
Dadhikrāvan, the bullish one of many favors,
whom, triumphant, shining like fire, you gave to the Pūrus, o Mitra and  Varuṇa, as one triumphant for the Pūrus.
### 3
Whoever has paid tribute to the horse Dadhikrāvan when the fire has  been kindled at the break of dawn,
him let Aditi make without offense, in concert with Mitra and Varuṇa. 4. Once we (have paid tribute to) the refreshment and the great
nourishment of Dadhikrāvan, and have brought to mind the
auspicious name of the Maruts,
we call upon Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, and mace-armed Indra for well-being. 5. Both (sides) vie in invoking (him) just like Indra, as they rouse
themselves and reverently approach the sacrifice.
Dadhikrā, who makes sweetness for the mortal, have you, o Mitra and  Varuṇa, given to us as our horse.
### 6
Dadhikrāvan have I paid tribute to—the victorious, prizewinning horse. He will make our mouths fragrant; he will lengthen our lifetimes.

40 (336) Dadhikrā (1–4), Sūrya (5)
Vāmadeva Gautama
5 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 1
The first verse of the hymn is in the same formal style as the preceding hymn, and  in fact is almost slavishly based on IV.39.1; it is also in the same meter (triṣṭubh) as  that hymn. But when the hymn turns to jagatī, its style changes dramatically—to  the exuberant, inventive, playful descriptions of the first Dadhikrā hymn, IV.38.  The three middle verses (3–5) capture the dizzying speed and agility of the horse
622 IV.41
as he races around the track, as they compare him to a bird swooping in full flight.  The language is equally dizzying and agile: the poet is fond of phonetic and mor phological figures, several of them involving morphologically impossible hapaxes  concocted by phonologically manipulating underlying morphology. (See esp. vs. 2.)
The final verse (5) is an explosion of morphological figures: eight compounds  ending in -sád- “sitting” (pādas abc), growing closer and closer together, followed  by four ending in -jā́- “born” crammed into the final pāda—which culminates in the  last word r̥tám “truth.” The referent of all these compounds is no longer the horse  Dadhikrā, at least not directly. Rather, as with the last verse of IV.38, the horse is  now identified with cosmic forces—the sun, but probably also the ritual fire—and  these in turn identified with the king. (See Proferes 2007:  127–28.) This verse is  much repeated and employed in later Vedic texts.
### 1
Just to Dadhikrāvan will we now pay tribute—let all the Dawns
sweeten me—
and to the Waters, Agni, Dawn, and the Sun, also to Br̥haspati Āṅgirasa,  the victorious.
### 2
A consummate warrior seeking plunder, seeking cattle, he will seek  fame in a rush to the distance, in a headlong rush to the refreshments  of Dawn.
The real thing—running, running faster, flying—Dadhikrāvan gives  birth to refreshment, nourishment, and the sun.
### 3
And (the wind) fans up his “feathers” [=mane], like the feathers of a bird  in greedy pursuit, while he runs and rushes headlong,
while he swoops like a falcon around the curving (racecourse), while he  keeps advancing with his vigor—Dadhikrāvan.
### 4
And this prizewinner, bound at neck, shoulder, and mouth, rushes  headlong to the lash—
Dadhikrā, growing stronger and stronger following his will, galloping  and galloping following the curves of the paths.
### 5
A goose sitting in the gleaming (waters), a good one sitting in the  midspace, a Hotar sitting at the vedi, a guest sitting in the dwelling,
sitting among men, sitting in the choice place, sitting in truth, sitting in  high heaven, water-born, cow-born, truth-born, stone-born—Truth.

Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
Though immediately preceding the great Indra–Varuṇa dialogue hymn IV.42, with  its themes of contested sovereignty and complementary divine and human royal functions, this hymn, also dedicated to Indra and Varuṇa, is a relatively simple and  straightforward joint praise of and appeal to the two divinities as an undifferenti ated pair. The poet speaks repeatedly of his desire for the friendship and compan ionship of the two gods, repeatedly asks them for their help, and seeks material gain  from them as well. Although the gods are not treated separately, the contents reflect  Indra’s qualities more than Varuṇa’s, for the two are especially beseeched for aid in  defeating rivals in contest and battles (vss. 2, 4, 6, 7, 11, with imagery derived from  contests in vss. 8–9).
### 1
O Indra and Varuṇa, which praise song obtains your favor, bringing  oblations like the immortal Hotar?
(The one) spoken by us, which, filled with resolve, filled with homage,  will touch your heart, o Indra and Varuṇa.
### 2
Indra and Varuṇa—the mortal who has made the two gods his own  friends for comradeship, bringing them pleasing offerings,
he smashes obstacles and his rivals in clashes; by your great forms of  help he becomes far-famed.
### 3
Indra and Varuṇa are the best at providing treasure to men who have  performed (ritual) labor just so,
when as comrades for comradeship they will make themselves
exhilarated with the pressed soma juices and the very pleasing
offering.
### 4
O Indra and Varuṇa, you powerful ones—smash your missile, your most  powerful mace down on him
who turns his evil ways on us, who is wolfishness and deception
(personified). Against him show the measure of your
overwhelming power.
### 5
O Indra and Varuṇa—become the lovers of this insight, like bulls of a  milk-cow.
She should yield her milk to us like a great cow with her milk in a
thousand streams who has gone to the pastures.
### 6
When progeny and posterity are at stake, when fields, the sight of the  sun, and the masculine power of the bull,
Indra and Varuṇa should be here for us, the wondrous pair with their  forms of help at the turning point.
### 7
For it is just you (we choose) for your age-old help because of your  pervasive preeminence, o good friends of the cattle-seeker;
we choose you for your dear comradeship, the two champions, most  munificent like parents, who are luck itself.
### 8
As those seeking prizes go to a contest, these insights, seeking you, have  gone to you for help, o you of good gifts [/drops].
As cows [=milk] approach soma for mixing, my hymns and inspired  thoughts have approached Indra and Varuṇa for splendor.624 IV.42
### 9
These inspired thoughts of mine have come up to Indra and Varuṇa,  seeking material goods.
Like those who enjoy a good thing, they have approached them,
seeking a share of goods as fleet mares (seek a share) of fame.
### 10
Might we by ourselves be lords of prosperity in horses and chariots, of  our own proper wealth,
making the two (gods) our own along with their newer forms of help.  Let riches in teams accompany (them) among us.
### 11
O lofty Indra and Varuṇa, with your lofty forms of help drive here to us  at the winning of prizes.
When the missiles will play in the battles, (thanks to) you might we be  the winners of this contest.

42 (338) Indra and Varuṇa
Trasadasyu Paurukutsya
10 verses: triṣṭubh
According to the Anukramaṇī, the author of this hymn is King Trasadasyu, and the  first six verses are his own self-praise. Beginning from a similar premise, Lommel  (1951) argues that verses 1–6 were spoken by King Trasadasyu on the occasion of  his royal consecration. Lommel points out that in the later royal consecration rite,  the king is compared to both Varuṇa as dharmapati “lord of dharma” and to Indra  as vr̥trahan “smasher of Vr̥tra.” Thus Trasadasyu identifies himself as both Indra  and Varuṇa, and because of these identifications the poet of the hymn affirms that  the king is “half a god” (vs. 8). Schmidt (1992) elaborated on this thesis, locating the  hymn in a different ritual context. He argues that according to later Vedic tradition  Varuṇa and Indra are dominant in different seasons, and this alternation between  the two gods is visible in this hymn. So according to Schmidt (1992: 340), “King  Trasadasyu impersonates both Varuṇa and Indra by performing their functions  according to the demands of the seasons.” This hymn marks the transition from the  settled period, in which the king enacts the role of Varuṇa, to the period of raiding  and battle, when he becomes Indra. Thus it begins with the king’s identification  with Varuṇa, but “in the third stanza the king affirms that he is not only Varuṇa but  also Indra and thus announces the transition to his Indra-like activities which he  details in the fifth and sixth stanza.” However the ritual context is interpreted, the  hymn provides insight into the nature of kingship in the R̥gvedic period.
It is not clear whose voice it is in verse 7. For Lommel it is the poet; for Geldner  and Renou, Varuṇa. Schmidt (1992: 341) offers the interesting suggestion that these  two possibilities need not exclude one another if at this point in the rite or at this  time of the year, a priest impersonates Varuṇa. He surmises that when the king left  for war, he installed a caretaker in the settlement, represented here by the poet. Verse 8 refers to a legend about the birth of Trasadasyu, but its details are  uncertain. According to Sieg (1902:  97–98), following a tradition mentioned in  Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa XIII.5.4.5, Purukutsa performed a Horse Sacrifice with a  horse named Daurgaha, and his son Trasadasyu was born as a result. As Lommel  (1951: 37) points out, this reference to Trasadasyu’s birth would have enhanced his  dignity and further justified his identification with Indra and Varuṇa because of  the favor those gods showed to his mother. Sāyaṇa gives another, less likely ver
sion of the legend. According to this version, King Purukutsa Daurgaha had been  captured. Seeing that the kingdom was left without a king, the principal wife of  Purukutsa appealed to the Seven Seers, who offered a sacrifice to Indra and Varuṇa  on her behalf, and the gods then gave her Trasadasyu as her son.
In the final verses (9 and 10) the poet addresses Indra and Varuṇa in a dual  dvandva compound indrāvaruṇā, which signals the gods’ close connection to one  another. Thus, while the rest of the hymn describes the two sides of kingship,  these last verses emphasize the unity of the kingship represented by the two gods  and their union in King Trasadasyu. The poet’s final request for a cow “that does  not kick” (ánapasphurantī) may be explained by its possible double meaning. On  the one hand, a cow that doesn’t kick is one that is easy to milk and therefore  represents the prosperity that the poet hopes for (10a). On the other hand, as  Renou notes, the description “never kicking” (ánapasphur) is applied to the soma  when it is compared to a cow in VIII.69.10. So then the cow in this verse may  also be good soma, which will “elate” the gods (10b). Therefore, the cow “that  does not kick” is both the successful sacrificial performance and the successful  result of the sacrifice.
### 1
[As Varuṇa:] Now as before, mine is the kingship of a lifelong ruler, so  that all the immortals (are) ours:
the gods follow the will of Varuṇa; I am king of the boundary of the  highest covering [=the boundary of heaven].
### 2
I am King Varuṇa. For me (the gods) uphold these foremost lordly  powers;
the gods follow the will of Varuṇa. I am king of the boundary of the  highest covering.
### 3
I, Varuṇa, am Indra. By my greatness, these two realms, wide and deep,  have strong support.
Like Tvaṣṭar, knowing all living beings, I pressed together the two
world-halves and upheld them.
### 4
I swelled the splashing (and mounting) waters; I upheld heaven on the  seat of truth.
Through the truth the son of Aditi possesses the truth, and he spread  wide the threefold earth.
### 5
[As Indra:] Men call upon me as they race to victory with their good  horses; surrounded in battle they call upon me.
626 IV.43
I make the contest—I who am generous Indra. Of overwhelming power,  I raise the dust.
### 6
I have done all these things. No divine power will block me, who am  unopposable.
When the soma juices, when the hymns, have exhilarated me, both
endless realms become afraid.
### 7
[The poet:] All living beings know this of you, and you proclaim these  things to Varuṇa, o you ritual adept:
you are famed as he who smashed obstacles; you, Indra, made the
blocked rivers to flow.
### 8
Our forefathers, the Seven Seers, were here, when Daurgaha was  being bound.
For her [=Purukutsa’s wife] they won by their sacrifice Trasadasyu, who  overcomes obstacles like Indra (and) who is half a god.
### 9
Because the wife of Purukutsa served you two with oblations and acts  of homage, o Indra and Varuṇa,
so then to her you two gave King Trasadasyu, who smashes obstacles  (and) who is half a god.
### 10
Having won, we should become elated by wealth, the gods by the  oblation, and the cows by pasture land.
All our days, o Indra and Varuṇa, grant to us the milk-cow that does  not kick.

Purumīḷha Sauhotra and Ajamīḷha Sauhotra
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The first four verses of this hymn are filled with questions, with the poet seeking  to identify the god or gods who will be most attentive to him. He begins by casting  his net widely, with any and all gods potentially the answer to his petitions. (These  plural possibilities are signaled grammatically and lexically: katamá “which one?”  [1a, 2a, 2b] explicitly requires a choice from three or more possible answers, and “of  those worthy of the sacrifice” [1a], “among the immortals” [1c], and “of the gods”  [2b] allow these choices to be made from the full set of divinities.) But the questions  soon pick the Aśvins out as the correct answer to the earlier questions. A query  about their chariot (2cd), which the maiden Sūryā chose as her bridal conveyance,  obliquely but uniquely identifies the Aśvins, and the remaining questions (vss. 3–4)  focus on their ability and willingness to aid us.
With our benefactors now identified as the Aśvins, the next two verses (5–6)  concern their chariot journey (somewhat obscurely), with the announcement of  the first sight of their chariot made in the second half of verse 6. In the final verse, identical to the last verse of IV.44, the poet reminds the gods that he has provided  them with nourishment and asks for their return favor.
The hymn displays a neat, but uninsistent, ring composition. In verse 1d the poet  asks where to “fix” his praise and offerings to the god, using a form of the root śri;  the same root is found in the final pāda of the hymn (7d), where our desire of the  gods is, reciprocally, “fixed.” This complementarity is emphasized by the two mor
phologically parallel words that express what we offer to the gods (suṣṭutí “good  praise,” 1d) and what we hope for in return (sumatí “good favor,” 7b). The hymn twice mentions the involvement of the Aśvins (and their chariot) in  the marriage of Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun (vss. 2, 6), the second time in the  present tense coinciding with our own first sight of their chariot. While most refer ences to Sūryā and her marriage in Aśvin hymns are set in the mythic past, in this  short Aśvin cycle (IV.43–45) Sūryā is present with the Aśvins when they come to the  sacrifice, travelling with them on the same chariot (see IV.44.1, 45.1).
### 1
Who will listen? Which one of those worthy of the sacrifice? Which god  will take pleasure in our extolling?
In whose heart among the immortals shall we fix this dearest divine good  praise accompanied by good oblations?
### 2
Who will have mercy? Which one (will be) the first to come? Which one  of the gods (will be) the most wealful?
What swift chariot with speeding horses do they say is the one that the  Daughter of the Sun chose?
### 3
For during days such as these you two come right away, like Indra to his  ability at the decisive turn.
You two, born from heaven as fine-feathered heavenly birds—by which  one of your abilities do you become the most able?
### 4
What is your distribution (of goods) and with what (distribution) do you  come here to us when called upon?
Who is yours? Make wide space for us in close quarters, even out of  great neglect, with your help, o honeyed, wondrous pair.
### 5
Your chariot reaches widely around heaven. When it rolls here to you  from the sea,
(its wheel-rims) splash honey upon honey on you, you two honeyed ones,  when cooked nourishments are roasted [?] for you two.
### 6
The Sindhu River sprinkles your horses with the Rasā; your ruddy birds  avoid the glowing heat.
Your speedy vehicle has just appeared, with which you two become the  masters [/husbands] of Sūryā.
### 7
Since I have nourished you two, whether here or there, in the same way, so  (let there be) this good favor for us, o you who bring prizes as treasures: make wide space for the singer. Our desire is fixed in your direction, o  Nāsatyas.

Purumīḷha Sauhotra and Ajamīḷha Sauhotra
7 verses: triṣṭubh
Connected with IV.43 by their shared final verse, this hymn begins with another  reference to the wedding journey of Sūryā on the Aśvins’ chariot, also expressed  in the present tense (like IV.43.6; see also IV.45.1). Thereafter the hymn concen trates solely on the Aśvins’ chariot journey to our sacrifice and the reciprocal ritual  exchange (aid and goods for soma and other oblations) that will occur there. The  threat of other sacrificers attracting the gods elsewhere is also on the poet’s mind  (vss. 3–5).
### 1
Today, o Aśvins, we would call your chariot of broad expanse here to its  meeting with the cow,
(the chariot) that conveys Sūryā, providing her a standing place, the best  of many, whose team is hymns, the one seeking goods.
### 2
You two, o Aśvins, you sons of heaven, win splendor among the gods by  your abilities.
Nourishments escort your wondrous form when the humped horses [?] convey you on the chariot.
### 3
Who today, having bestowed his oblation, will attract you here with his  chants, for help or for drinking the pressed soma,
or, having held fast to his reverence, will turn (you) here for the foremost  striving for truth, O Aśvins?
### 4
O you who appear in many places, with your golden chariot drive right  up to this sacrifice here, o Nāsatyas.
Just you will drink of the somian honey, and you will establish a treasure  for the person who distributes it.
### 5
Drive right here to us from heaven and from the earth with your golden,  smooth-rolling chariot.
Let the others who seek the gods not hold you down, because our
ancient umbilical tie is attached to you.
### 6
Now, wondrous ones, measure out lofty wealth conferring many heroes  to us both [=singers and patrons].
As the superior men furthered your praise, o Aśvins, the Ājamīḷhas have  come to your joint praise.
### 7
Since I have nourished you two, whether here or there, in the same way,  so (let there be) this good favor for us, o you who bring prizes as
treasures:
make wide space for the singer. Our desire is fixed in your direction, o  Nāsatyas. 

## 45

Vāmadeva Gautama
7 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7
This hymn represents the culmination of the chariot-journey sequence in the three  Aśvin hymns of Maṇḍala IV. In IV.43 the poet began by asking who among the gods  will listen to his prayers and come to him with aid. Having identified the Aśvins  as his target, he briefly describes their chariot and its journey and announces its  arrival. In IV.44 the poet once again calls the chariot and the Aśvins to his sacrifice  and urges them to avoid the sacrifices of others.
Here in this hymn (IV.45), the Aśvins’ chariot journey is depicted as happening  simultaneously with the performance of the sacrifice, and in fact the two realms  are to some extent conflated. Their chariot(s) and horses behave in the same way  and are described with the same verb (vs. 2ab) as the beam of the kindled ritual fire  (vs. 1a), and the Aśvins both come bringing honey and come for the honey offered  them. (Honey is a leitmotif throughout the hymn, occurring at least once in each  of the first five verses.) The ritual is also depicted in more detail than in the last two  hymns: see the actions of the priest in verses 5ab and 7d. Moreover, the exact time  at which the journey and the sacrifice are happening, namely dawn, is repeatedly  mentioned (vss. 2, 4, 5), and the other light sources associated with the break of day  have their place in the hymn: the ritual fires (1a, 5ab) and the sun (vss. 2, 6).
As in the other two Aśvin hymns in this series, Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun,  is present not merely in mythological memory but in the present, ritual time—but  in this hymn she is not mentioned by name. Instead, an ingenious turn of phrase  “three ...are on (the chariot) as a pair” in verse 1 must refer to the pairing of the  two Aśvins with Sūryā, especially since the word for “pair” mithuná is regularly  used for a sexual pairing. Her anonymous appearance in the first verse of the hymn  suggests the fertile fruitfulness that the overflowing honey in the rest of the hymn  also represents.
The final verse of the hymn formulaically celebrates the Aśvins’ chariot, and  this verse sums up not merely this hymn but the triad of Aśvin hymns that it closes.
### 1
Now this radiant beam arises; the earth-encircling chariot is hitched up  upon the back of this heaven.
Three bringing nourishment [=Aśvins and Sūryā] are upon it [=the
chariot] as a pair; a fourth, a skin-bag, teems with honey.
### 2
Up rise your nourishing, honey-filled chariots and horses at the break  of dawn,
uncovering the darkness that had been confined and stretching like the  blazing sun through the dusky realm.
### 3
Drink of the honey with your honey-drinking mouths and hitch up your  own dear chariot for honey.
630 IV.46
You quicken the course of the path with honey, and you carry your
honey-filled skin-bag, o Aśvins.
### 4
Your geese—honeyed, unfaltering, golden-feathered, calling “uhu” [?],  waking at dawn,
swimming in water, invigorating, stroking the invigorator [=soma]— (along with them) you go to the pressings of the honeyed (soma) like  flies to honey.
### 5
Providing good ceremonies, honey-filled, the ruddy fires awaken at dawn  in response to the Aśvins,
when the wide-gazing (priest), his hands washed, advancing (across the  ritual ground), has pressed the honeyed soma with stones.
### 6
(Your horses) keeping watch nearby through the days, in constant  agitation, stretching like the blazing sun through the dusky realm—
hitching up his own horses, the Sun also comes speeding. By your own  independent power, you two perceive all the paths.
### 7
I have (now) proclaimed (this chariot of) yours, o Aśvins, setting my  insight before you—the unaging chariot that has good horses,
with which in a day you drive around the dusky realms to the provider  offering oblation, as he advances (across the ritual ground).

This simple hymn never strays from its ritual purpose:  at the Morning Pressing  of the soma sacrifice, Vāyu and then Indra and Vāyu receive the first offerings of  soma. Here they are urged to come to the sacrifice and drink their shares.
### 1
Drink the foremost of the honeys, the pressed (soma), o Vāyu, at the  rituals of daybreak,
for you are the first drinker.

With a hundred forms of help for us, (come,) provided with a team,  having Indra as charioteer.
O Vāyu—may you both become sated on our pressed (soma).

Indra and Vāyu, let your thousand fallow bays convey you here, to the  pleasurable offering,
to drink the soma.

O Indra and Vāyu, here is the pressed (soma): in concert with the gods drink it in the house of the pious man.

Vāyu, the clear (soma) has been held out to you, the foremost of the  honey, at the rituals of daybreak.
(Since you are) craved, drive here to drink the soma, o god, (on a

O Indra and Vāyu, you two have the right to the drinking of these soma  drinks,

48 (344) Vāyu
Vāmadeva Gautama
5 verses: anuṣṭubh
Unlike the two preceding hymns to Vāyu and Indra (IV.46–47), with their simple  diction and single purpose, this hymn to Vāyu alone, although it also continues  the journey motif, especially in the refrain of verses 1–4, contains some enigmatic  phraseology and striking images. In particular both the sense and the syntactic con
struction of the simile in the second pāda of verse 1 are much disputed. On the  basis of VI.14.3 we believe “the riches of the stranger” (rā́yo aryáḥ) to refer to Ārya  people in general and their poets in particular.
Note that the soma-drinking, the purpose of Vāyu’s journey, is mentioned only  in the refrain, and that the time of day for the ritual, early morning, is only obliquely  referred to, in verse 3.
632 IV.49
### 1
Pursue the invocations not (yet) pursued, just as “the riches of the  stranger” [=the poets of the Āryas] pursue poetic inspirations.
– O Vāyu, drive here with your glittering chariot, to drink of the pressed  (soma).
### 2
Taking taunts out of harness, (but yourself) provided with a team, with  Indra as charioteer,
o Vāyu, drive here with your glittering chariot, to drink of the pressed  (soma).
### 3
The two black treasure chambers [=Night and Dawn], with all their  ornaments, have directed themselves after each other in turn.
– O Vāyu, drive here with your glittering chariot, to drink of the pressed  (soma).
### 4
Let the ones with mind as yoke, the ninety-nine yoked ones, convey you. – O Vāyu, drive here with your glittering chariot, to drink of the pressed  (soma).
### 5
O Vāyu, hitch up a hundred flourishing fallow bays,
or, since you have thousands, let your chariot drive here with its (full)  dimension.

49 (345) Indra and Brhaspati ̥
Vāmadeva Gautama
6 verses: gāyatrī
This simple hymn is reminiscent of the nearby Vāyu and Indra hymns (IV.46–47),  elementary in diction and simple in purpose, inviting the two divinities to come and  drink the soma. It seems likely that IV.49 was indeed based, somewhat artificially,  on those former hymns, as there is no standard ritual offering of soma to Indra  and Br̥haspati as there is to Indra and Vāyu. Indeed, Br̥haspati does not otherwise  drink soma in the R̥gveda (save for IV.50.10). Evidence for the dependence of this  hymn on Indra and Vāyu hymns is found in the second pāda of verse 3, which is  also found in I.135.7 with the grammatical subjects Indra and Vāyu. The elemen tary and derivative nature of this hymn contrasts strongly with the richness of the  following hymn (IV.50) to the same divinities.
### 1
This dear oblation here is in your mouth, o Indra and Br̥haspati;
the solemn speech and the exhilarating drink are being announced.
### 2
This soma here is being poured in circles for you, o Indra and Br̥haspati, pleasing, to be drunk to exhilaration.
### 3
Come here to our house, o Br̥haspati and Indra,
as soma-drinkers to drink the soma.
### 4
In us, o Indra and Br̥haspati, place wealth in hundreds of cows,
rich in horses, thousand-fold. 5. Indra and Br̥haspati we invoke with hymns when (the soma) is pressed, to drink of this soma here.
### 6
Drink the soma, o Indra and Br̥haspati, in the house of the pious one. Become exhilarated, being at home with it.
## 50 
50 (346) Br̥haspati (1–9), Br̥haspati and Indra (10–11)
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 10
This hymn falls naturally into several sections, but although some scholars con sider it to be a composite of up to three independent hymns, an overall unity can  be detected. (Of course, this unity may results from the combining of once sepa rate elements.) Indeed, the hymn seems to encapsulate the historical development  of the Vala myth, which concerns the freeing of the cows from the Vala cave where  they were imprisoned, and its principal participants, Indra, Br̥haspati, and the  Aṅgirases. As Schmidt has clearly shown (1968), Indra was the original hero of  the Vala myth, in his role as priest-king and with his priestly weapons—songs  and correctly formulated true speech—with the Aṅgiras singers as his helpers. In  this role he received the epithet “br̥haspati.” But in time the epithet was split off  into a separately conceived divine figure Br̥haspati, first as an alloform of Indra  and then detached from Indra as an independent divinity who served as Indra’s  priest—taking with him Indra’s priestly role, while Indra retained the roles of king  and warrior. In this hymn we first see a unitary (Indra-)Br̥haspati figure, then the  human equivalent of the split figure, in the form of king and “Formulator” priest.  And finally the split divine figures, Indra and Br̥haspati, are invited to share the  ritual.
The first six verses are dedicated to the mythic deeds of Br̥haspati (or  “Br̥haspati”) with the Vala myth occupying verses 2–5. The Aṅgirases are promi nent, though not named. The final verse of this portion (6) clearly brings the sec tion to a close, returning it to the present with explicit treatment of our ritual  honoring of Br̥haspati, and wishes for our continued prosperity typically found  in hymn-final verses. Verses 7–9 promise success of all sorts to the king who does  honor to Br̥haspati and to his earthly representative, the “Formulator” (Brahmán),  a role that will evolve into the later Purohita (house-priest of the king) (note the  verb phrase puró √dhā in vs. 1). This section seems to apply the lessons of the  mythic past found in verses 1–6 to the contemporary situation and to establish a  symbiotic relationship between Formulator and king, matching the relationship  between the mythic Br̥haspati and the (unnamed) Indra, from whom Br̥haspati  has been split. It follows logically that the last two verses (10–11) invite Br̥haspati  and Indra to the sacrifice to drink the soma and bestow blessings on us. The uni tary role in the opening mythic section has evolved into the double divine figures634 IV.50
summoned in the final section, by way of the mediating section showcasing these  complementary roles in the human domain.
### 1
He who with his strength propped apart the ends of the earth, with a  roar—Br̥haspati possessing three seats—
him with the gladdening tongue did the seers of old, the inspired poets  in meditation, set in front—
### 2
Those [=Aṅgirases] of noisy tread, exulting at the good sign,
o Br̥haspati, who for us have battered at
the dappled, glossy, uncheatable (cow-)enclosure [=Vala cave].
O Br̥haspati, (after their action) guard its womb [=(the contents of)
the Vala cave, the cows].
### 3
O Br̥haspati, that which is the farthest distance, (coming) from there  have those who touch the truth [=Aṅgirases] sat down here (for
sacrifice) for you.
For you do the deep-dug springs, milked by the stone, drip an
abundance of honey all about.
### 4
Br̥haspati, on first being born from the great light, in the farthest  distant heaven,
he, possessing seven mouths [=Aṅgirases] and seven reins [=seers?],  being powerfully born, blew apart the dark shades with
his roar.
### 5
He with his flock possessing good rhythm, the flock possessing chant— he broke Vala, broke its bolt with his roar.
Br̥haspati drove up the ruddy (cows) who sweeten the oblation, who  kept lowing as he was bellowing.
### 6
Thus to the father to all the gods, to the bull, we would do honor with  sacrifices, with homage, with oblations.
O Br̥haspati, may we, possessed of good offspring and of heroes, be  lords of riches.
### 7
Only that king surmounts all the (forces) belonging to his opponents  through his tempestuousness and heroism
who supports Br̥haspati (to be) well-supported, behaves agreeably  to him, and extols him as the one receiving the first
portion.
### 8
Only he dwells peacefully, well-situated in his own home; for him  refreshment swells at all times;
to him the clans bow just of themselves—for which king the
Formulator comes first.
### 9
Unopposable, he wins riches belonging to his opponents and those  belonging to his allies.
The king who makes wide space for the Formulator seeking aid, him do  the gods aid. 10. Br̥haspati and Indra, drink the soma, becoming exhilarated at this  sacrifice here, you who have bullish goods.
Let the drops that stand by you enter you. In us deposit wealth
consisting of hale heroes.
### 11
Br̥haspati, Indra, strengthen us. Let this benevolence of yours keep  company with us.
Aid our insightful thoughts; awaken plentiful gifts. Exhaust the
hostilities of the stranger, of the rapacious ones.
## 51 
51 (347) Dawn
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is remarkable first for the fact that the dawns are always presented and  addressed in the plural (“Dawns”) rather than the singular, as so often. Indeed,  when the poet wishes to refer to a single dawn, he uses instead the word “light”  (vs. 1)  or an unspecified pronoun (vs. 6). The grammatical plurality of the sub
ject Dawns serves a thematic purpose: as in other dawn hymns the poet notes that  each day’s dawn is different, yet paradoxically all dawns are the same, coming in an  unbroken chain from the east day after day (see, e.g., vs. 8).
As V. Yareham suggested (in an unpublished paper presented at the University  of Texas Vedic Workshop, May 2007), the hymn is structured around an ompha los verse (6), with concentric matching verses surrounding it: 1–2 / 10–11 and  3–5 / 7–9. The omphalos poses a central and essentially unanswerable question,  the one that always arises about the dawn(s): how can they be both the same  and different, and the poet expresses his anxiety that he cannot identify the  particular dawn in the swarm of identical ones. Behind this anxiety is another  one, seen especially in verses 4, 6, and 7, namely whether we, the current sacrifi cers, will have the same material success with our dawn sacrifice as the ritualists  of old.
Otherwise, the imagery is of the usual type for dawn hymns:  the brilliant  beauty of the dawns in contrast to the darkness, which they banish; their abrupt  arising in the east and their subsequent journey; and the prayers for largesse,  reminding us that the dakṣiṇā, the priestly gifts, were distributed at the dawn  sacrifice.
### 1
Here has this light, the latest of many, stood (up) out of the east from the  darkness, with its patterns.
Now the daughters of Heaven radiating widely, the Dawns, will make a  way for the people.
### 2
They have stood up—the bright Dawns—in the east, like the sacrificial  posts fixed at ceremonies.
636 IV.51
They have unclosed the doors of the enclosure of darkness as they  dawn, blazing and pure.
### 3
Dawning today, the bounteous Dawns brighten the benefactors for the  giving of largesse.
In (a place) without brightness let the niggards sleep, unawakening in  the middle of darkness.
### 4
Goddess Dawns, should it be the old course or a new one for  you today—
(or the one going) along which, you rich ladies, you richly dawned  on the Aṅgiras(-clan) of the Nine-Cows, of the Ten-Cows, of the  Seven-Mouths?
### 5
For you, goddesses, with horses whose yoke is truth, drive around the  creatures in a single day,
awakening the sleeping, every two-footed and four-footed living thing,  to activity, o Dawns.
### 6
Where is she, which one of them is she, the age-old one along  with whom they distributed the distributions of the
R̥bhus?
(I ask because) when the beautiful Dawns proceed in beauty, they  cannot be distinguished—the unaging ones having the same
appearance.
### 7
These same auspicious Dawns existed of old, those of superior  heavenliness, who were really born of truth,
at whose (time) one who had sacrificed and labored with
hymns, praising and chanting, reached wealth in a single
day.
### 8
They proceed, in the same way, from the east, spreading out from the  same place in the same way.
The Goddess Dawns, awakening from the seat of truth, like gushes of  cows, become wakeful.
### 9
Just these now—the same ones in the same way—with immutable  colors, the Dawns proceed,
hiding the black void with their bright (colors), glistening, gleaming,  shining with their own bodies.
### 10
O daughters of Heaven, radiating widely, bestow on us wealth in  offspring, o goddesses.
Being awakened from a comfortable place in response to you, may we  be lords of an abundance of heroes.
### 11
O daughters of Heaven, radiating widely—I whose sacrifice is a beacon  implore this of you, o Dawns:
May we be glorious among the peoples. Let both Heaven and Goddess  Earth ensure this.

A simple hymn in contrast to the immediately preceding dawn hymn, with Dawn  depicted and addressed only in the singular. The Aśvin pair is named in verses 2–3  because of their early-morning journey to the sacrifice.

Having filled it up, wide-radiant one, you have uncovered the darkness  with your light.
O Dawn, help (us) according to your independent power.
### 7
Through heaven do you stretch with your rays, through the midspace  wide and dear,
o Dawn, with your bright brilliance.

53 (349) Savitar
Vāmadeva Gautama
7 vereses: jagatī
A relatively straightforward hymn dedicated to Savitar, literally “the Impeller.”  Savitar’s natural control over the rhythms of life—alternatively setting the world  in motion and causing it to settle down—is emphasized, as is his omnipresence in  the cosmos. It is noteworthy that throughout the hymn, even in the requests for  Savitar’s protection and benefits (vss. 1, 6–7), the god stays in the 3rd person, gram
matically distanced from us despite his direct involvement in our affairs.
### 1
We would choose that great thing, worthy to be chosen, of god Savitar,  the provident lord,
with which by himself he holds out shelter to the pious. The great god  has held it up for us through the nights.
638 IV.54
### 2
The supporter of heaven, the lord of offspring of the living world, the  sage poet, fastens on himself a tawny cloak.
Wide-gazing, spreading out and filling the wide (midspace?), Savitar has  begotten praiseworthy benevolence.
### 3
He has filled the heavenly and earthly realms. The god makes his  signal-call to support his own.
Savitar has stretched forth his two arms, at his impulsion causing the  moving world to settle down and impelling it forth through the nights. 4. Undeceivable, watching over living beings, god Savitar guards his  commandments.
He has stretched his two arms for the offspring of the living world. He  whose commandments are upheld rules over the great road.
### 5
Savitar (encompasses) the midspace three times in his greatness; he  encompasses the three dusky realms and the three realms of light.
He speeds the three heavens and the three earths. With his three
commandments he guards us by himself.
### 6
Possessing lofty benevolence, the one who impels forth and causes to settle  down, who exerts his will over both the moving world and the stationary, let him, god Savitar, hold out to us shelter providing threefold protection  against distress for us and for our dwelling place.
### 7
The god has come according to the ritual progressions. Let him make  our dwelling place strong. Let Savitar establish for us refreshment that  brings good offspring.
Let him quicken us through the nights and the days. Let him speed
wealth that brings offspring.

54 (350) Savitar
Vāmadeva Gautama
6 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 6
This hymn conveys a much more intimate sense of our connection to Savitar than the  preceding hymn with its formal praises. This intimacy is achieved by the aorist of the  immediate past that opens the hymn announcing his epiphany—“he has arrived!”— and by the vocatives and 2nd-person address that follow. The closeness of our rela tionship with the god allows us to ask him for something more personal than the  shelter and support requested in IV.53, namely (in the middle verse, vs. 3) for Savitar
to intercede on our behalf with anyone, divine or mortal, whom we have offended. The hymn also makes heavy use of the verb sū “impel” from which Savitar’s  name is derived: it is found in all verses but the first.
### 1
He has arrived—god Savitar to be greeted by us now and at this very  time of day to be invoked by superior men— he who apportions treasures to the sons of Manu so that he will establish  the best material wealth for us here.
### 2
For you first impel immortality to the gods worthy of the sacrifice as  their highest share;
just after that, o Savitar, you reveal your gift: lives following in
succession for the sons of Manu.
### 3
Whatever we have done to the divine race, because of heedlessness, or  scant skills, or excess of power, or our sheer human nature,
o Savitar, among both the gods and the sons of Manu, impel us to be  without offense here.
### 4
The (commandment?) of the divine Savitar is not to be violated, so that  he will support all the living world.
Whatever he of the beautiful fingers impels on the expanse of earth or in  the height of heaven, that of his comes true.
### 5
(You impel) those whose chief is Indra [=Maruts] from the lofty  mountains, and you impel the dwelling places that provide homes
[=clouds?] for them.
Just as they spread out while flying, just so do they stand still for your  impulsion, o Savitar.
### 6
O Savitar, as three times a day your impulsions impel good fortune day  after day,
Indra, Heaven and Earth, the Sindhu with her waters, Aditi with the  Ādityas, will extend shelter to us.
## 55 
55 (351) All Gods
Vāmadeva Gautama
10 verses: triṣṭubh 1–7, gāyatrī 8–10
The only hymn dedicated to the All Gods in Maṇḍala IV, it is clearly a composite  hymn in two different meters, divisible into 1–7, 8–10. The last three tacked-on  verses are extremely simple; not so the first and more substantial part of the hymn,  which is full of difficulties and uncertainties, especially in verses 2 and 6.
This first section opens with questions about identity (vs. 1): who among the  gods will protect and defend us, and who (among mortals?) will provide a safe space  at the sacrifice for the gods. The hymn provides a number of possible answers to the  first question, starting in fact in the first verse: Heaven and Earth, Aditi, Mitra and  Varuṇa. All of these recur in subsequent verses, along with others: Night and Dawn  (vs. 3); Aryaman, Agni, and Indra and Viṣṇu (vs. 4); the Maruts (vs. 5); in addition  to lesser divinities and powers like the Sindhu (vs. 3); Ahi Budhnya (vs. 6); and so  on. It is likely that the hymn does not envisage a single answer to the question,  though Aditi and the Ādityas continually surface in these verses, and Aditi, Mitra,
640 IV.55
and Varuṇa, named in verse 1, are again named in verse 7, which forms a ring with  verse 1. Although a clear answer to the first question is not given, the verses describ ing or invoking these named gods’ help are relatively clear (3–5, in addition to 1, 7).
This leaves the second and second-to-last verses (2 and 6), symmetrically paired  in this structure. In examining the hymn thus structurally, one can form the hypoth esis that, since the other verses suggest answers to the first question in verse 1, these  two verses provide the answer to the second question (1d): “Who will establish wide  space for you at the ceremony, o gods?” Although this hypothesis does not solve all  the difficulties, especially of the cryptic verse 2, it does offer a means to approach  the problems. Certainly verse 2 can be interpreted as the depiction of a dawn sacri fice: the Dawns appear to be the subject of pāda b (discriminators because they mark  the boundary between night and day), and the chanters of pāda a can then be the  priests. Pāda c can then refer to the distribution of the dakṣiṇā, priestly gifts, at the  dawn ritual, and the subjects of pāda d can be the Dawns, the gods present at the  sacrifice, or the poets—or all three. The sacrificial context returns, somewhat more  clearly, in verse 6, where it seems that the priests reveal the actual sacrificial sub stance in the same manner as the gods revealed the contents of the Vala cave (using  the same verb). In both of the “sacrificial” verses, then, it seems that divine charac teristics and mythical exploits are attributed to the presumably mortal participants.
If these speculations about the structure of this hymn are at all correct, it is  striking that the gods are identified by name and by role quite clearly, but the rit ual participants are left deliberately unclear. This may be another example of the  poets’ reflection on the mystical nature of the sacrifice and of the transformations it  effects not only in the sacrificed substance but in the sacrificers themselves, tempo rarily endowing the latter with a touch of divinity.
### 1
Who is the protector among you (all), o good ones, who the defender? O  Heaven and Earth, o Aditi—you should protect us
from the stronger mortal, o Varuṇa and Mitra. Who will establish wide  space for you at the ceremony, o gods?
### 2
Those [=priests?] who will chant forth the ancient ordinances while the  discriminators who are never fooled [=Dawns?] will dawn widely—
they are the untiring distributors who make distribution. The wondrous  ones whose insights are truth have shone.
### 3
I reverently invoke the Housegoddess, Aditi, the Sindhu with chants,  (invoke) divine Well-Being for comradeship.
Night and Dawn, the undeceivable, will arrange it so that both day
halves will keep guard over us.
### 4
Aryaman clears out a path, and Varuṇa; the lord of refreshment, Agni,  (clears out) a way easy to traverse.
Indra and Viṣṇu—when you are being praised in our manly way, hold  out shelter to us and defense along with attack.
### 5
The help of the Mountain, of the Maruts, of the divine Protector, of  Bhaga have I chosen. The lord [=Agni? Varuṇa?] will guard us from anxiety stemming from  (our own) people; Mitra from that stemming from our allies, and he  should make wide space for us.
### 6
Now, you divine World-Halves, one should praise (you) along with Ahi  Budhnya, with watery sacrifices.
They [=priests?], desirous of gain, have revealed them [=the watery
sacrifices?] gurgling like the gharma pot, (like) rivers in their
converging on the sea.
### 7
Let goddess Aditi, with the gods, keep guard over us. Let the god  Protector protect us, not keeping his distance,
for we ought not to violate the wellspring of Mitra and Varuṇa nor the  back of Agni.
### 8
Agni is lord of a mass of goods, Agni of great good fortune.
He will grant these to us.
### 9
Bounteous, liberal Dawn, convey hither many valuables
to us, you who are rich in prize mares.
### 10
So to us Savitar, Bhaga, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman—
to us Indra—will come with generosity.
## 56 
56 (352) Heaven and Earth
Vāmadeva Gautama
7 verses: triṣṭubh 2–4, gāyatrī 5–7
Like the preceding hymn, this one is divided into two by meter: 1–4, 5–7; the two  were presumably independent hymns originally. The first four verses mix invoca tions of Heaven and Earth at the current sacrifice with cosmogonic accounts of  their creation (see esp. vs. 3 and its present-time counterpart in 1cd), but the ritual  context is dominant. There are a number of puns. The short second hymn continues  the ritual focus.
### 1
Let great Heaven and Earth, the preeminent ones, come to be here with  their light, with their gleaming rays [/at our gleaming chants],
when, fixing the two lofty ones apart as the widest, the bull bellows to  them along the ways that spread broadly.
### 2
The two goddesses deserving the sacrifice, along with the gods
deserving the sacrifice—they stay, not confounding (the heavenly
commandments) [/not altering (their color)], growing strong
[/dripping (ghee)],
truthful, without deceit, the two whose children are the gods, the
two leaders of the sacrifice with its gleaming chants [/with their
gleaming rays].
642 IV.57
### 3
He certainly was the good artisan among the creatures who begot these  two, Heaven and Earth:
the two wide, deep, well-fixed realms did the wise one fit together in
propless (space) with his skill.
### 4
Now, you two World-Halves, with your lofty defenses, nurturing us in  concert with (the gods) accompanied by their wives,
protect us, o you of wide extent, who entirely deserve the sacrifice.
Through our insightful thought may we be charioteers who
always win.
### 5
We present to you two, great (Earth and) Heaven, a praise-invocation to be proclaimed to you two gleaming ones.
### 6
Purifying your own bodies mutually, you two rule each through your  own skill.
You have constantly conveyed the truth from of old.
### 7
You two great ones assure it success, as you further and fulfill the truth  of Mitra.
You have stationed yourself around the sacrifice.
## 57 
57 (353) Agricultural Divinities
Vāmadeva Gautama
8 verses: anuṣṭubh 1, 4, 6–7; triṣṭubh 2–3, 8; puraüṣṇih 5
This hymn is in a variety of meters, alternating throughout the poem, and it is  dedicated to a number of different divinities related to agriculture. With its num ber of verses it is out of place in the collection, and its subject matter and tone  are more “popular” than those of the core R̥gveda. It is not possible to determine  whether the hymn we have now was assembled out of several separate hymns, but  at least verses 1–3, dedicated to the Lord of the Field, hang together, though they  are not metrically uniform. A curious feature in the later part of the hymn is the
dual address (via a dual dvandva compound) to “Prosperity and Plow” (vss. 5, 7). Hymns like this give us precious glimpses into everyday life and the technical ter minology of particular professions. The hymn is notable also for its address to the  Furrow (vs. 6, see also 7), the first appearance of the feminine noun sī́tā, renowned  in later Sanskrit of course as the name of Rāma’s noble wife in the Rāmāyaṇa.
### 1
By means of the Lord of the Field as if by a concluded (alliance),  may we win
what prospers the cow, the horse. He will be gracious to one such as us. 2. O Lord of the Field, as a milk-cow yields milk, milk out upon us a  honeyed wave,
dripping with honey, well-purified like ghee. Let the lords of truth be  gracious to us. 3. Honeyed the plants, the heavens, the waters—honeyed let the midspace  be for us.
Let the Lord of the Field be honeyed for us. Without suffering harm  may we follow after him.
### 4
Prosperity (be) the draft-animals, prosperity the superior men; for  prosperity let the plow till.
For prosperity let the straps be bound; for prosperity brandish the goad. 5. O Prosperity and Plow, take pleasure in this speech here. When you have  made milk in heaven,
with it besprinkle this (earth) here.
### 6
Become inclined our way, well-portioned Furrow. We will extol you, so that you will be well-portioned for us, so that you will be well-fruited  for us.
### 7
Let Indra lay down the Furrow; let Pūṣan extend her straight.
Let her, full of milk, yield milk to us, summer after summer.
### 8
For prosperity let our plowshares till through the earth; for prosperity let  our plowmen advance with their draft-animals.
Prosperity (let) Parjanya (be) with his honey and milk drinks. O
Prosperity and Plow, place prosperity in us.

58 (354) Ghee
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 11
The Anukramaṇī provides a bewildering variety of choices for the divinity of this  hymn: Agni, or the Sun, or the waters, or the cows—or ghee (ghr̥ta), the clarified  melted butter regularly used as an oblation in sacrifice. The last is clearly correct.
Ghee is here given the same type of exalted, high-style rhetorical treatment as  the other crucial ritual substance, soma, with which it is also identified in this poem.  Phraseology appropriate to soma is applied to the streams of ghee throughout, and,  like soma, ghee becomes the focus of mystical speculations and also the subject of  vivid images. It is not surprising that this significant sacrificial substance should  receive such poetic glorification, especially given the importance of cows and cow  imagery in the R̥gveda.
What should really surprise us is that only this poet in this late and final hymn in  just one maṇḍala should have seen fit to make ghee his subject. Soma, after all, has a  whole maṇḍala of 114 hymns to itself. Grammatical accident may help account for  the difference: sóma is grammatically masculine and thus easily personified, while  ghr̥ta is grammatically neuter. However, the prominence of the cognate substance in  Old Iranian (Aves. haoma, Old Persian hauma) and the existence of a lengthy praise  hymn to deified Haoma in Younger Avestan (the Hōm Yašt, Yasna 9–10) testify to  a long tradition of celebration of soma, which is not shared by ghee.644 IV.58
### 1
From the sea a honeyed wave has arisen; along with the (soma-)plant it  has reached all the way to immortality.
The name of Ghee that is hidden: “the tongue of the gods,” “the navel  of the immortal.”
### 2
We will proclaim the name of Ghee; at this sacrifice here we will uphold  it with reverences.
The formulator will hear it as it is being announced. The four-horned  buffalo [=soma] has vomited it.
### 3
Four are his horns, three his feet; two heads, seven hands are his. Triply bound, the bull keeps on roaring. The great god has entered  mortals.
### 4
Triply deposited, being hidden by the niggards—the gods discovered the  ghee in the cow.
Indra begat one; the Sun begat one; from the seeker they fashioned one  through their own power.
### 5
These (streams) rush from the sea found in the heart. Having a hundred  barriers, they are not to be spotted by the cheat,
but I keep gazing upon the streams of ghee. A golden reed is in  their midst.
### 6
These nourishing liquids flow together like streams, being purified  within by heart and mind.
These waves of ghee rush, like wild beasts retreating from a javelin. 7. As if on the straightaway of a river, they fly—the youthfully exuberant  ones, swift-battering, confounding the wind—
the streams of ghee—like a ruddy prizewinning horse splitting
the wooden race-course barriers [/splintering the sticks (in their  current)], swelling with their waves.
### 8
They float—like lovely young women to (marriage) assemblies— smiling, to Agni.
The streams of ghee approach the kindling sticks. (Agni) Jātavedas  delights, taking pleasure in them.
### 9
I keep gazing upon them, who are like maidens smearing on unguent to  go to their wedding.
Where the soma is pressed, where the sacrifice (is performed), toward  that do the streams of ghee go purifying themselves.
### 10
Rush toward the lovely praise hymn, to the contest for cows; on us  confer auspicious chattels.
Lead this sacrifice here to the divinities for us. The streams of ghee  purify themselves like honey.
### 11
All the living world is firmly fixed in your domain, within the sea in  your heart, within your lifespan.
The one that was borne hither at the forefront of the waters in their  joining, that one may we attain—your most honeyed wave.Volume II
