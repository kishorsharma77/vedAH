Agni here is compared with soma, though without mention of that word.

The comparison is esp. obvious in the verb marmrjyánte ‘they keep grooming’, since √mṛj is a signature word for soma, and in the descriptive phrase in b. As Old (SBE) points out, soma is often called aruṣá- ‘red’ (though it must be admitted that Agni is too), and ‘child of heaven’ (diváḥ śíśu-) is also a somyan epithet (IX.33.5, 38.5, though cf. VI.49.2 where it modifies Agni). As discussed in the publ. intro., this covert reference to soma ushers in the Dānastuti for Prince Sāhadevya, whose nickname is Somaka (9c).
