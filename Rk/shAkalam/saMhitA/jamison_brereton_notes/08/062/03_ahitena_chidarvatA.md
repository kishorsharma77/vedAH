Gr, Ge take áhita- as ‘useless’ (untauglich), the negation of what I think of as a later specialized sense of hitá- as ‘useful, beneficial, friendly’, which is not, as far as I know, found in the RV. In his n. Ge allows the possibility of connection with √hi ‘spur on’ (which is Sāy’s view), and this seems the better choice. Parallel phraseology supports it: IV.7.11 hinvé árvā, V.36.2 árvato ná hinván, plus the numerous exx. of √hi + áśva-, átya-, and other words for horses. Ge’s cited parallel, VI.45.2 anāśúnā cid árvatā “even with a steed lacking speed,” also provides support.

I use the “be about to” sense, always possible for desideratives, to tr. siṣāsati, rather than ‘desires to win’. The question is not whether Indra wants to win - of course he does - but that he is about to win despite unfavorable circumstances. The ‘about to’ sense also works better with the future part. kariṣyatáḥ in d.
