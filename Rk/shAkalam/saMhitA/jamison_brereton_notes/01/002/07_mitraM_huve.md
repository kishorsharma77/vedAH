Here and everywhere else it is found, the word riśā́das-, an epithet of various gods, is opaque. There are currently two competing and entirely different interpretations: that of Karl Hoffmann (Aufs. 564 n. 16) as ‘discriminating, fastidious’ (< ‘picking at food’) and Paul Thieme’s ‘caring for the stranger’ (Fremdling). See EWA s.v. The contexts are not diagnostic, and it is probably the case that the epithet was no longer understood even as it was being deployed (note that it is almost always pāda-final, possibly a sign of formulaic freezing).

Throughout our translation we have followed the Thieme interpretation, but not with any great conviction. One thing in favor of the Thieme interpretation is that the word is regularly applied to one or more of the Ādityas (as here), who might be expected to show care for humans in their charge. That it is also regularly used of the less ethically inclined Maruts might give us pause (though these contexts are generally benevolent ones) - except that ‘fastidious’ is even less a likely quality of the Maruts than ‘caring for the stranger’.
