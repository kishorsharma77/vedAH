The diction in this vs. is somewhat difficult to apply to the chariot that is its subject. What does it mean for a chariot to be “difficult to deceive/trick” (dūḷábha-, reprised from 2a)? Perhaps it always follows the right route? And the lexeme pári √(n)aś, which barely exists (an infinitive in I.54.1), in conjunction with viśvátaḥ should mean “reach around/encircle on all sides,” again an odd action to ascribe to a chariot. Given the paint-by-numbers style of the hymn, I attribute these lapses to an inattentive or unskilled poet. Note the careless combustion in vs. 1.
