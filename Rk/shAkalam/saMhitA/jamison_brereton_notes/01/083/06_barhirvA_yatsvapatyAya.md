The relation between the three subordinate clauses (abc) and the main clause is irregular in that tásya in d does not pick up a relative pronominal referent. I take it as referring to the sacrificer who has been regularly present in the hymn (the presenttime vss. 1-3). Ge and Re may well be right that the kārú- ‘bard’ of c, which is identified with the pressing stone, is its logical referent.
