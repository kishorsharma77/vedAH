The morphological ambiguity of bhúvaḥ (injunctive or subjunctive) allows for several possible interpretations of the first half-vs. Ge takes bhúvaḥ as imperatival “sei,” though this is unlikely given the morphology. Hoffmann (Injunk.

262) takes it as a “generell oder resulativ konstatierend” injunctive and tr. “du bist” (so also WG). By contrast, I think these two fronted bhúvaḥ are subjunctives and questions. There is of course no way to tell. However, the purpose clause with subjunctive in 20cd .. yáthā … ásan naḥ ... avitā “so that he will be our helper,” matching our pāda a bhúvo ‘vitā́, suggests that bhúvaḥ is indeed a subjunctive and that further we are not at this point certain that Indra will become what we want him to -- hence a question rather that a statement is more appropriate. As for how bhúvas,

-at came to be aor. injunctives homonymous with the morphologically more
transparent root aor. subjunctives, I find KH’s scenario (56) plausible, that they were secondarily generated to 1st sg. bhuvam (e.g., X.48.1; 49.1, 4; 86.5), which is the properly built injunctive to the root aor. (though cf. TS II.5.1.1 bhūvam). However, I do not follow KH in taking the motivation for this formation the avoidance of monosyllabic forms, since injunc. bhū́s, bhū́t are quite common. (A more likely explan. in the Hoffmannian mode would be that, since bhū́s, bhū́t can do double duty as imperative substitutes, bhuvas, -at make the injunctive value clearer.) I’d rather suggest a different reason why injunctive bhúvas, -at took hold and could exist simultaneously with the subjunctives of the same shape, while putative injunctives káras, -at, secondarily built in the same way as bhúvas, -at to 1st sg. karam, are essentially only subjunctives. Because of the lack of ablaut of √bhū, the zero-grade of the root syllable of the subjunctive bhúvas, -at doesn’t accord with standard subjunctive formations and must have seemed at best equivocal, whereas káras, -at is a perfect specimen of a subjunctive and does not invite other morphological interpretations.
