Notice the very un-Ārya phonology of the name of the patron, Bṛbu with two plain b’s. (On Bṛbu as patron see Kuiper, Aryans, p. 6.) It is probably not an accident that this vs. contains only one of two reff. to the Gaṅgā in the RV (the other a voc. gaṅge in X.75.5), since the Gaṅgā is at the limits of the RVic geographical horizon.

The simile is more lit. “(he is) broad like the Gangetic girth.”
