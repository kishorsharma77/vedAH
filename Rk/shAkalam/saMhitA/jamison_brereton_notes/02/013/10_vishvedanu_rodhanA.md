Although víśved … rodhanā́(ḥ) must belong together semantically, it is difficult to make this work grammatically: rodhanā́in this sandhi pos. can’t be neut.

-ā, but must stand for -ā(ḥ) -- so Pp. -- (or, far less likely, -ai). It therefore can’t
properly be modified by a víśvā extracted from víśvéd. Old sees the problem, but Gr simply lists the form as neut. -ā; Ge [/WG], Re don’t mention and tr. as a phrase. The sandhi of either víśvéd or rodhanā́asya has to be tampered with to harmonize the two words; I have no opinion on how to make this work. The only other RVic occurrence of the noun is differently accented: ródhanā, a neut. pl. (I.121.7); AiG II.2.190 considers our form a fem. stem rodhanā́- beside root-accented neut. ródhana-, acdg.

to an existing pattern.

The awkward doubling of asya … asmai should be noted in the tr.: “… have conceded his manliness to him,” with both pronouns referring to Indra. Perhaps the asya is there because most exx. of ánu √dā ‘concede’ involve the subject conceding some quality of its/his own to a third party, so the fact that the paúṃsya- is Indra’s to begin with needs to be emphasized.

I have no idea what the second hemistich is about, except that it obviously involves some cosmogonic activity and the viṣṭíraḥ and the saṃdṛ́śaḥ are implicitly contrasted. In d pári paró shows phonetic play, but I do not understand the function of paráḥ here.
