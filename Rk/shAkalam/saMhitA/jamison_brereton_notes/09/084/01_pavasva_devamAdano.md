Acdg. to Ober (I.526), this vs. is concerned with the “landerobernde Funktion (König) Somas,” which makes sense. Pāda c directly asks Soma to provide us with wide space, and his epithets vícarṣaṇi- ‘unbound(ari)ed’ and apsā́- ‘waterwinning’ in ab belong to this conceptual realm. In d urukṣitaú ‘in the wide dwelling place’ may as well, if it refers to our (newly acquired) dwelling, per Ober. Re takes it rather as the dwelling place of the divine folk, but given the context Ober’s view is more persuasive.
