The standard tr. take pāda b as a nominal sentence (“the praise song is a doorpost”), but the verb of pāda a, aśrāyi ‘has been fixed, propped’, fits b very nicely, as Old argues. Ge suggests such an interpretation in his notes, without rendering it in tr.

The poet Kakṣīvant mentioned in vs. 13 is associated with the Pajras, who are mentioned a number of times in the hymns attributed to Kakṣīvant. ET points out that pāda b probably contains a pun on the PN pajrá-, which literally means ‘sturdy, steadfast’, a meaning which works well with the fixed doorpost.

I take prayantā́in d as a periphrastic future, not a straight agent noun.
