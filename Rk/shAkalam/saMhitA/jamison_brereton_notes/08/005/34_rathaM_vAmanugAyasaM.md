The hapax -gāyas- (a hapax) in ánugāyasam- is generally taken as a primary s-stem to the diphthongal root √gā i̯ ; see Whitney (Roots), AiG II.2.235, EWA s.v. √GĀ2 . The contextual question is what is following what. For Ge the song is sounding after/following the chariot (“Gesang schallt eurem Wagen nach”), but most ánu- compounds have the structure “following X,” where X is the 2nd member (e.g., ánu-patha- ‘following/along the path’; with diff. accent anu-kāmá- ‘following/according to desire’). I therefore think the chariot is following the song; in other words, it is making its way to the ritual ground, drawn to the song being sung there. Rather like the modern expression “follow the money.” Pāda b seems to be a clear embedded relative clause -- or else, at least as I have punctuated it, a parenthesis.

The point of c seems to be that the wheel doesn’t knock against the chariot no matter how fast it moves. Such knocking presumably would be a problem with wheels that were not securely fastened to their axle and well balanced, so the Aśvin’s chariot is, not surprisingly, well constructed.
