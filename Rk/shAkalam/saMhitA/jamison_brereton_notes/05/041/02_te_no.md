After the cat’s cradle of vs. 1, this vs. comes as a welcome relief -- or at least in its first half, which consists of a list of gods in the nom. and a verb they can all serve as subject to. With 6 gods (and an epithet -- or 7 gods if ṛbhukṣā́is taken separately) to fit into 22 syllables, the poet can’t get into too much trouble.

The 2nd hemistich is slightly more complex. It consists of an elliptical vā rel.

cl.: “or (in those) who …,” with the gapped ‘those’ parallel to enclitic naḥ in pāda a.

The final word sajóṣāḥ I take as referring to the gods; the stem(s) sajóṣa(s)- is generally used of gods (see sajóṣāḥ in 4b), and note that their verb juṣanta ends the first hemistich. But, with the standard tr., it may refer to the mortals providing the gods’ praise.
