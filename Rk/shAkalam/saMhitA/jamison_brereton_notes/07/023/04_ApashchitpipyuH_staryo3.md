‘Teams’ (niyút-) often appear in context with Vāyu and his driving. Often, of course, they are his teams, but here and frequently elsewhere the ‘teams’ clearly stand for our poetic thoughts. Cf., e.g., I.135.2, VI.47.14, X.26.1. Therefore, it is unnecessary to supply, with Ge, a verb of guiding or yoking to make the teams into Vāyu’s.

The instr. dhībhíḥ is taken in the publ. tr. as an instr. of accompaniment, but it could also be an instr. of price/exchange: “in exchange for (our) visionary thoughts.”
