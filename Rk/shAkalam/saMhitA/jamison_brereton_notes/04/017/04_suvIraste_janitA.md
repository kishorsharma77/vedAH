This vs. shows a clever twist on ring composition. Like vss. 1 and 2 it contains occurrences of both heaven and earth (here dyaúḥ a, bhū́ma d), and in fact pāda a ends exactly as 1b does: manyata dyaúḥ. But the two phrases mean very different things: in vs. 1 manyata is construed with ánu in the lexeme meaning ‘concede’, whereas here there is no preverb and the verb means ‘be considered as’.

Moreover, although in the 1st two vss. heaven and earth functioned as a pair, though expressed as two singulars, here they have nothing to do with each other, and indeed earth is found only in a negative simile (sádaso ná bhū́ma, which in Engl. has to be awkwardly rendered by “any more than …”).

On the tangled paternity here, see publ. intro.
