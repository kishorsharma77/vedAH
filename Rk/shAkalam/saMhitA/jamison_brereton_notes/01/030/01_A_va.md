The word krívi- makes trouble wherever it shows up. In some of its occurrences it appears to be a personal name, but that is unlikely here. It is not even clear if all the occurrences of krívi-, even in non-personal uses, belong to a single stem -- in fact it seems unlikely (see comm. ad V.44.4). Here the context favors an equine reference, and I have taken it as designating a particular color of horse, viz., ‘blood-red’. Assuming, with most scholars, that krívi- in at least some of its usages is connected with krívis- in the hapax adj. krívir-dant- (I.166.6), which possibly means ‘having gory teeth’, and that both are etymologically connected with kravís- ‘raw, bloody flesh’, as a color term ‘blood-red’ would work well. The details of the derivational relation I leave to others, but a putative -i-stem to the underlying root krū < *kruh2 (in krūrá- [AV+]) would have the shape *kruh2-i- > *kruv-i-, and assimilation to krívi- would not be difficult.

The verse is structured by number disharmony — the pres. part. vājayántaḥ is nom. plural, but the finite verb siñce is singular — reflecting the common conceptual fluctuation between the collectivity of priests and singers and the priest-poet speaking in his individual voice.
