The simile in pāda a requires a hidden term of comparison. The “reddish horses” (áśvāḥ … aruṣā́saḥ) must be, covertly, the flames of a fire; that is why they have the same lineage, because they all flare up from the same source. I doubt that the poet was telling us that all red horses have the same bloodlines! The two middle similes (b, c) seem redundantly phrased, in that in each case one of the terms applied to the subject also provides the verb: prayúdhaḥ prá … yuyudhuḥ (b), suvṛ́dho vāvṛdhuḥ (c). I do not understand the stylistic point of this redundancy, but since it’s repeated in adjacent pādas it must be deliberate.

I also don’t understand the utá in b, placed between preverb and verb (prótá yuyudhuḥ) and with nothing obvious to conjoin. Klein (DGRV I.373-74) takes it as conjoining b with a, but gives no explanation for its position, whose extreme rarity he notes.

Another anomaly in b is the metrical shape of the verb, in pāda-final position: yuyudhuḥ would be far better read *yūyudhuḥ. Although no forms of this poorly attested perfect is transmitted with long reduplication, it’s worth noting the hapax redupl. i-stem yū́yudhi- (X.149.4), a variant of yúyudhi- (2x).
