This vs. is somewhat curiously constructed. It contains, probably, a dual dvandva whose 2nd member is itself dual: índra-nāsatyā ‘o Indra and the two Nāsatyas’. Since the form is in the voc. it is actually impossible to determine if it is in fact a dual dvandva or two separate vocc., índra nāsatyā, sg. and du. Although in most dual dvandvas the first member also has dual inflection (type índrā-váruṇā), see indra-vāyū́, with stem form in the first member and a single 2nd member accent; its voc. is índra-vāyū, which would match the template found here. In any case, the verb is dual (gatam), and the rest of the verse (pāda c) is couched in the dual. This either means that Indra is being ignored (which is possible, since the hymn is dedicated to the Aśvins) or that the dual dvandva índra-nāsatyā is being treated as if it contained two entities, rather than one+two (which is also possible). For another number mismatch, see vs. 11.
