Since Agni is often called the mouth of the gods, Ge (and others) assume that the loc. āsán in d refers to Agni, and the gods have produced a drinking cup (pā́tram) to put in his mouth. But this requires Ge to treat the three-pāda accusative phrase that opens the hymn and refers to Agni as grammatically untethered, as an anacoluthon with the referent picked up in the loc. in pāda d (see his n. 1d). But, with Re, I see no reason why Agni cannot be conceptualized here as the cup that the gods drink from.

Re considers āsán simply an attribute limiting the pā́tra-, a “récipient pour la bouche, récipient à boire,” while I take it as referring to the gods’ (collective) mouth.

Note the phonologically matching words aratím and átithim stationed in the same metrical position in pādas a and c.
