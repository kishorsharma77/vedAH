The aor. impv. pāhi here implicitly contrasts with the pres. impv. píba in 1b, 2b, 4d. As usual, it is difficult to know how much semantic or functional difference to read into this contrast. See disc. ad III.35.10. In this particular case the root noun cmpd. ṛtupāḥ may have triggered the immediately following pā(hi).

Re tr. ṛtupāḥ as ‘guardien des temps-rituels’, with √pā ‘protect’ rather than √pā ‘drink’. I think it unlikely in a dull little hymn like this that there would be a pun of that sort, and the sequence ṛtúbhir ṛtupāḥ pāhi, with the two elements of the cmpd.

extracted from it and flanking it, seems to impose etymological identity.

The second hemistich refers to Indra’s allowing the Maruts a share in the soma because of their support in the Vṛtra battle. For a dramatization of this ritual situation, see I.165 and associated hymns.
