In the expression kā́vyam uśáneva the first word is the acc. obj. of bruvāṇáḥ, but it is also of course a play on the patrynomic of Uśanā, the differently accented kāvyá-.

In d the publ. tr. takes padā́as neut. pl., based on IX.12.8 abhí priyā́divás padā́, … arṣati “Soma rushes towards the dear tracks of heaven,” adduced by Re.

However, it is also possible and, I now think, desirable to interpr. it as an instr. sg.

“along the track.” I would not interpr. the instr., with Ge, as “mit dem Fusse.” On PREV eti rébhan# see IX.96.6=17, IX.97.1 (this hymn) and with emi VII.18.22; “snorting” or “grunting” would be a better rendering of rébhan in the boar context.
