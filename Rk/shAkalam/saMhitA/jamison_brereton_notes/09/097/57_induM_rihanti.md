The simile in b is one of the best pieces of evidence for my interpr. of √ribh as ‘squawk, creak,’ etc., rather than ‘sing’. The simile “like birds of prey” (ná gṛ́dhrāḥ) only makes sense if the verb that expresses the sounds of the voices of the poets (kaváyaḥ) is not a mellifluous one. Both Ge and Re struggle with this. Ge reduces rebhanti to ‘become hearable/known’: “… werden die Seher lautbar wie die Geier” (not the first quality one things of for a Geier); Re simply recasts the simile: “sur sa trace ils psalmodient, comme des poètes avides (de gain).”
