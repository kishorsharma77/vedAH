The hapax ā́kīm (so, e.g., Gr, Aufr, HvN, Lub) or, more likely, ā́kīm contains what is apparently a now meaningless particle kīm, matching the shape of the acc. particles īm and sīm. Though clearly derived from the interrogative *ku̯

-stem, it has
lost all interrogative value, presumably “laundered” through the weak negative indefinites ná kīm (or nákīm) and mā́kīm (or mā́kīm). It is not at all clear what, if anything, kīm is doing here.
