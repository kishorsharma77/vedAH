The use of the epithet vṛtrahán-, esp. in the superlative, for Agni is of course striking since this is overwhelmingly an Indra descriptor. The name agní- hasn’t yet figured in the hymn, but jā́tavedaḥ in vs. 1 clearly announces him as the recipient of this praise.

As noted above, the second pāda is technically an embedded relative (assuming that nonumaḥ in c governs tvā in a).
