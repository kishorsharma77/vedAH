Subordinating ca as in II.41.11, also with a subjunctive.

The root noun cmpd. abhibhā́- occurs only here in the RV, but 5x in the AV, which seems only to make it more obscure. Twice in the phrase “let not abhibhā́or aśasti find you” (i.e., parallel to this phrase), but also in conjunction with dogs and jackals once, once abhibhā́-s can speak, and once in conjunction with diseases. Wh.

transl. ‘portent’. Though not a lit. tr., Engl. “evil-eye” seems to correspond well to the contextual sense of the word; I have adopted it from Klein (DGRV II.240).

Pāda d should be read as a Jagatī, though neither Old nor HvN comment. The cadence is a Jagatī cadence and the proper number of syllables is achieved by reading víśvi yā as a trisyllable (so already Gr, also AiG III.78). The word is otherwise not found in the RV, but such a cluster begs to be distracted, and by Wackernagel’s analysis of it as modeled on urviyā́(AiG III.78, flg. Brugmann), it would have -iyā́ by nature.
