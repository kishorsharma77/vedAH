Based on my interpr. of the structure of vss. 7-8, I supply Agastya as the subject of 8ab, which not only lacks an overt subject but also an overt verb, for the reasons sketched above. Ge supplies “(opferte er),” WG “(ruft man an)”; I favor something like the latter (my ‘summons’), on the somewhat fragile basis that yuvā́m is fairly frequently the obj. of √hū ‘call, summon’ (cf., e.g., I.47.4=VIII.5.17 yuvā́ṃ havante aśvinā).

Curiously enough prá does not appear with verbal forms of √sru ‘flow’, but the preverb probably indexes the ritual fact that Aśvins receive their offering at the Morning Pressing, the ritual event that leads off the soma offerings of the day.

vírudra- is a hapax and difficult (but what is not in this hymn?), but with Ge, etc., I take it as a bahuvrīhi ‘having Rudra (or rather the Rudras=Maruts) away’, referring to soma. As Ge hints (n. 8b), this probably is a reference to the Agastya - Indra - Marut cycle that forms such a dramatic part of Agastya’s oeuvre. It would refer in part simply to the fact that this is the Morning Pressing, and the Maruts receive their soma at the Midday Pressing. But also more specifically to the fact that whether the Maruts should have any part in the soma sacrifice and whether in particular they should have a share in Indra’s part were fraughtly disputed in those hymns. Agastya is in effect pointing out that there was never any question of the Aśvins having to share with the Maruts. (That by some accounts the Aśvins only got included in the soma sacrifice belatedly might make this a question that would exercise them.) The actual form, vírudra-, is reminiscent of the nominal clause ví paṇíḥ … “the niggard is away” in 7b.

Pāda c is fairly straightforward, and it is worth noting that prá √śaṃs here is used of a human (though not a king, unfortunately), reflecting what I think is its original domain. There is some debate about the value of citayat, which belongs to the functionally malleable stem citáya-. But in the absence of anything that could serve as an object, I take it as the intransitive it regularly is, ‘appear, be conspicuous’.

As for sahásraiḥ, everywhere else where it’s clear, this instr. pl. refers to cows or other countable forms of wealth (so also WG in n.), and I take it as indicating the reason for Agastya’s perceived prominence.

Yet another hapax troubles us: kā́rādhunī. Both Ge and WG refuse to tr. it.

But given the other intractable problems in this hymn, it seems one of the lesser issues. The 2nd member -dhuni- is surely dhúni- ‘noisy’ or probably, substantivized ‘noise, tumult’. It also seems reasonably possible to connect kā́rā- to kārú- ‘bard’ and assign it a tenative meaning ‘praise-song’ (so also EWA s.v. kārú-, citing also AiG II.2, etc.). The form in the text (with probable but not certain -ī final, so Pp.) can be an instr. sg. The remaining problem is the accent, which should make the cmpd a bahuvrīhi, a grammatical identity at odds with my tr. “with a tumult of praise-songs.” AiG II.1.221 simply says it has abnormal accent, and with nothing better to offer, I will simply allow Wackernagel the last word on that subject. I take this simile with what precedes (“proclaimed as if with …”) rather than what follows (“is conspicuous by thousands as if by …”). Its position would allow either, despite the pāda break.
