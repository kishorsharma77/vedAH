With Klein (DGRV I.135, etc.), I take the double ca as conjoining morphologically parallel bhójanam and várdhanam, despite the preposed position of the 2nd ca. This preposing would be supported by 7a where a correctly positioned second ca in a double ca construction is found in the same metrical position and before an almost rhyming final word, dhármaṇā.

Because of the accent on dudóhitha, pāda b must continue the relative cl. of pāda a, rather than serving as its main cl. as in the publ. tr., which should be corrected to “You, who distribute … and who have milked ..., / you have hidden …” I’m inclined to take the loc. vivásvati here as “bei/chez Vivasvant” rather than “in Vivasvant” as in the publ. tr. That is, Indra set down a treasure in the vicinity of Vivasvant, presumably as a reward for V’s sacrifice, rather than within his body.

JL points out the complex mirror-image figure that straddles the pāda break in cd: #sá … dadhiṣe vivásvati, víśvasyaíka īśiṣe sá … The two interior elements, vivásvati and víśvasyaíka(ḥ), are phonologically similar and isosyllabic; they are flanked by 2nd sg. mid. perfects with rhyming ending -iṣe; and the pronoun sá with 2nd sg. reference provides an outer ring.
