Indra
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
11 verses: atyaṣṭi, except atiśakvarī 8–9, aṣṭi 11
The hymn begins with familiar, and positive, themes: calls to Indra to aid our actual  chariot in prize-contests and also our metaphorical chariot, the sacrifice (vss. 1–2),  and these themes recur throughout the hymn. But the poet seems preoccupied  with more negative topics—not only rivals and enemies in battle (vss. 3–5, 10) and  demons (vss. 6, 9, 11), but also evil thoughts and words (vss. 6–8, 11). Bad Thought  appears to be personified as a menacing female in verse 8, and more surprisingly  Indra seems himself to have potential bad thoughts toward us, his worshipers,  which we must combat by supplying him with good things to think about (vs. 7). Given the forces thus arrayed against us, the calls for Indra’s protection grow ever  stronger toward the end of the hymn (vss. 9–11).
