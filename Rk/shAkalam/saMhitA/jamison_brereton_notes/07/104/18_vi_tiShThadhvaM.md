I am not entirely certain why it is the Maruts who are tasked with the destruction of these creatures, though it is probably because the demons in question have taken the form of birds and therefore are moving in the midspace, which is the Maruts’ domain. Re also cites the well-known relationship between the Maruts and the víś- (see vikṣú here), and these animal demons may be associated with the “folk.” The root noun ríp- is otherwise used of cheats and swindles (cf. also ripú- ‘cheating, swindler’), and I am reluctant to allow a sense ‘defilements’ only here -- though it is the almost universal solution of other tr. (Wh, Brown, Klein [DGRV II.149: “impurities”], Lommel “Unsauberes,” but cf. Ge’s “Unredlichkeit” [dishonesty], which has a moral nuance). Deception and cheating are also characteristic of the animal-demons in this section: see the khargálā who conceals her own body “with deceit” (druhā́) in 17b, the flying dog-sorcerers that want to deceive Indra in 20b, and the oblation-stealers in 21b -- so the standard sense of rípfits the larger context. However, I do have to acknowledge that the root √rip does mean ‘smear’, and so ‘defilement’ is not out of the question.

It is difficult to avoid taking devé here as an adjective ‘divine’, modifying adhvaré ‘ceremony’, a temptation that all tr. (including me) have succumbed to and that is endorsed by Old.
