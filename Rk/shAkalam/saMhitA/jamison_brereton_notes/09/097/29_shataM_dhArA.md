I take the hapax sanítra- in its full lexical value, as a ‘means of winning’, rather than the bleached Spende, Gabe (Gr), Lohn (Ge), le bénéfice (Re) that prevails. On the accent of the word (and other -tra-stems to seṭ roots), see AiG II.2.701-2, which also glosses the word as I do: ‘Mittel des Gewinnens’, flg. Ludwig.
