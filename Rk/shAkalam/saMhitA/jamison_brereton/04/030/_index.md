Indra  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
24 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 8, 24, arranged in trcas ̥  
This long hymn, constructed of triplets, begins with a celebration of Indra’s  supreme power (vss. 1–3) and ends with a summary of the same (vss. 22–23, with604 IV.30  
24 a pendant). In between lies a catalogue of many of Indra’s famous, and not  so famous, deeds—though avoiding the most famous of these, the Vala and Vr̥tra  myths (save in the repeated epithet “Vr̥tra-smasher,” vss. 1, 19, 22). The most  detailed treatments are of Indra’s theft of the Sun’s wheel (vss. 4–6) and the smash  
ing of Dawn’s cart (vss. 8–11), myths whose contents are not entirely clear to us,  despite regular allusions to them. Both myths are also treated in X.138, and as in  that hymn (see introductory remarks there), we see in both myths a reflection of  Indra’s assertion of control over cosmic time by deregulating it, at least temporar  
ily. This theme seems to be announced in verse 3c, immediately preceding the story  of the Sun’s wheel.  
The other deeds are related in cursory fashion, one per verse, and the abundance  of forms of utá “and” emphasizes the additive nature of the hymn, especially in its  second part. In this it resembles the catalogue hymns devoted to the Aśvins’ rescues  and favors to men.
