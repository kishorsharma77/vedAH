Indra
Bharga Pragātha
18 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
This hymn begins with the invitation to soma (vss. 1–3), but the poet soon turns his  attention to the gifts Indra will bestow, a theme that dominates the rest of the first  half of the hymn (through vs. 8). The sacrificial context returns at this point, and in  verses 11–12 the sacrificers seek to harness Indra as their comrade, whose powers they  wish to marshal for their protection against hostile forces (see esp. vss. 13, 15–18).
The syntax is fairly straightforward, but there are a number of rare words and  hapaxes (e.g., the last two words of vs. 9) and pleasing verbal plays. The poet espe cially likes variable repetition (of the type “unassailable assailant” vs. 3).
