The first hemistich is taken universally as a reference to the Sun, and my publ. tr. follows this understanding. However, this identification may not be very strong: although, as Ge says, the Sun is sometimes imagined as a horse, sometimes as a chariot, it can scarcely be thought to whinny (kánikradat) -- this detail must simply be attached because of the horse image -- and the ‘high’ or ‘arched’ back (ūrdhvásānu-) may be appropriate to the path of the sun across the sky but does not fit the round shape of the actual heavenly body. Nonetheless, I don’t have a better idea.

In the publ. tr. the rendering of acíttam in c should be “(Though it) cannot be comprehended …” not “(Though it cannot be) comprehended …,” since the negation is plainly there. This should be corrected also in the first line of the intro. I do not understand the unusual accent (rather than expected *ácitta-). AiG II.1.226 cites a few other examples (e.g., amṛ́ta-) but gives no explanation.

In the publ. tr. “their ordinance” does not sufficiently make clear that it’s the ordinance of Mitra and Varuṇa (as in 4d mitrásya váruṇasya dhā́ma), not that of the youths.
