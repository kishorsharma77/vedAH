The “three” and “seven” have received various identifications; mostly likely for the “three” in my opinion are the three sacrificial fires, for the “seven” perhaps the priests or, as a generic number, his flames.

Most (explicitly Old [SBE], Re) take Agni’s two parents to be Heaven and Earth, and certainly some cosmic resonance may be secondarily meant. But the repeated focus on the fire-churning sticks in the birth of Agni in Dīrghatamas’s oeuvre (see reff. in publ. intro.) and the fact that the expression pitrór upásthe is used elsewhere of Agni’s birthplace in the kindling sticks (most clearly III.5.8, VI.7.5) make it likely that they are meant here as well. If so, this provides a solution for the two gen. sg. pres. participles in c, cárato dhruvásya. Instead of supplying yet more cosmic entities here (e.g., Old “and of whatever moves or is firm”), I take the two gen. singulars as specifying the two entities making up the pair in the dual gen. pitróḥ “of the two parents [lit. fathers]” in b, with one kindling stick held firm and the other moving across it to produce friction. I take the asya in c as referring to Agni; because it is unaccented, it should be used pronominally not adjectivally (despite WG “… dieses Gehenden”), and it should refer to something already in the discourse (as Agni is).
