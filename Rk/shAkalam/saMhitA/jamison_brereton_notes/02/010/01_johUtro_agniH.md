As noted in the publ. intro., the first word of the hymn, johū́tra-, forms a ring with johavīmi, the last word. The connection between them is emphasized by the intensive redupl. in johū́tra-; no other -tra- stems show redupl., much less intensive reduplication. Gr (and, it seems, WG, here though not in I.118.9; II.20.3 isn’t clear) take the stem as act. (‘laut rufend’), but a passive value makes better sense in all 3 occurrences (so Old [SBE], Ge, Re). The -tra- form in the next vs., víbhṛtra- (2d), is likewise passive. My tr. “invoked … on every side” is based on the possibility that the -tra- suffix evokes the -tra adverbial locatives (such as átra ‘here’), although this may be pushing the limits (likewise my ‘dispersed in many places’ for víbhṛtra- in 2d). It does, however, work with the thematics of the first few vss.: vs. 2 urgently begs to hear my call (hávam me, with the possessive prn. emphatically placed pādafinal), and the two occurrences of vícetāḥ ‘discriminating’ (1c, 2b) suggest that Agni is choosing among the various sacrifices he might attend on the journey described in 2cd.
