suśastíbhiḥ in pāda b is taken by Ge (also Gr) as modifying ūtíbhiḥ in pāda a (“mit diesen löblichen Hilfen”; Ge takes návyasībhiḥ as adverbial “aufs neue”), but this requires suśastí- to be adjectival. However, almost all occurrences of this stem -- and all seven other instr. -- are nouns (‘good laud’)(and see nominal suṣṭutím ‘good praise’, identically formed and nearly synonymous, in 30c below). Although in Gāyatrī the b-pāda more regularly construes with the a-pāda, it is not out of the question for it to go with c instead. In this case the instr. phrase of b goes well with c, and it would only represent one constituent fronted before the subordinating yád.
