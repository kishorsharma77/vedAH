This vs., esp. its 2nd half, bristles with difficulties and has been interpr. in an exhausting variety of ways (not only the usual tr., but also, e.g., Old at length in ZDMG 55.283-84=KlSch 742-43; Thieme Unters.; Lüders, AcOr 13 [=Phil.Ind.]; Scar 146-47; Gonda, Ved.Lit. 219). I will not treat these other interpr. in detail, but merely lay out my own, which is in closest agreement with Lüders (“Ved. heṣant-...,” Philol. Ind.: 781ff.) through the first half of c. The general point of the vs. seems to be, as often, to contrast the fearsome and militant aspects of Agni with his benign ones.

It might also be pointed out that pāda a, which is the most straightforward part of the vs., has a bad cadence that is not easily fixable; in fact it presents an unusual sequence of 5 light syllables: (sū́ro ná yá)sya dṛśatír a(repā́). I do not see any way to make -tír heavy. The first question, in the relatively transparent 1st hemistich, is what bhīmā́ modifies. Though Ge and Re take it with dṛśatíḥ -- that is, Agni’s appearance is both spotless (arepā́) and fearsome -- the pāda boundary weakly suggests that bhīmā́ should be construed with the other fem., namely dhī́ḥ. On the assumption that this dhī́- is Agni’s, bhīmā́identifies the dhī́- with the violent side of Agni.

In c, with Ge and Lü inter alia, I assume that a new clause begins with nā́yám and, also with Lü, that héṣasvant- means ‘possessing arms, armed’. The opening of this pāda héṣasvataḥ śurúdhaḥ then is a nominal clause, with the gen. héṣasvataḥ expressing possession. Cf. III.38.5 imā́asya śurúdhaḥ santi pūrvī́ḥ “here are his many proliferating riches”; sim. IV.23.8 ṛtásya hí śurúdhaḥ sánti pūrvī́ḥ “Of truth there exist many riches.” The rich spoils that fall to Agni are presumbly the various materials he burns.

The published tr. importantly omits aktóḥ. It should be corrected to “(But) on his own, by night, this one here …” This temporal adverb implicit contrasts with sū́ro ná of pāda a. That is, the appearance of the militant Agni is compared to the sun, the light of day, whereas the benign Agni described in the second half of c + d is a phenomenon of night.

On the famous crux nā́yám see comm. ad VIII.2.28 and my 2013 Fs. Hock article. Pace Thieme (1949: 51-52) and Lub, who classifies this passage separately, I believe that nā́yám here belongs with the other occurrences of this syntagm.

The adj. raṇvá- recurs here from VI.2.7. On its indirect association with ‘home, dwelling’ in that passage and its direct associations elsewhere, see comm. ad loc. Here it might be better to render the phrase raṇvó vasatíḥ as “delightful dwelling” rather than “cozy nest” to bring out the echoes with the passage in the previous hymn.

I take kútrā cid as temporal rather than spatial.
