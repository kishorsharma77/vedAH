My tr. of sū́ro anyā́“the other is the sun’s” follows Old, who adopted it from Ludwig. Ge (/Re) supply an instr. raśmíbhiḥ ‘with the rays’, parallel to stṛ́bhiḥ, on which sū́raḥ depends. This seems unnec. Re’s claim that the accent on pipiśé “déconseille l’interpretation de sū́raḥ donnée par Old.” does not convince: although by the Old reading pipiśé is not part of both anyā́clauses as it would be with the additional instr., it occurs at the boundary of two explicitly contrastive clauses, which would, I think, be sufficient to induce accent.
