For the switch between singular reference to the Marut collectivity in ab and plural reference to the same group in cd, see disc. ad 3cd.

A particularly insistent etym. figure in c: sáhāṃsi sáhasā sáhante. The metrical irreg. of the pāda, with a likely rest at 5 (so HvN), after sáhāṃsi, may draw attention to it.

On the address to Agni in d, see comm. ad 10.
