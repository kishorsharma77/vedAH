This vs. contains a fairly clever double meaning: the verb pári √sic means ‘sprinkle around / in circles’. When soma is the object, as it generally is, it refers to the sprinkling of the drops of soma; in other words, the acc. expresses the material that is being sprinkled. But here in the simile vā́je ná vājayúm, the acc. vājayúm ‘prize-seeking’ refers to a horse in a race or contest, which would be the target or the goal of the sprinkling, with some type of liquid being sprinkled upon it. The word play is cleverer still, in that vājayúm should be read twice, both as referring to the horse in the simile and to soma, which is elsewhere modified by this word (e.g., IX.44.4 sá naḥ pavasva vājayúḥ), in the frame.

Both Ge and Re construe vā́je in the simile rather loosely; I take it as a unmarked loc. absol. of the dháne hité (“when the prize is set,” e.g., IX.53.2) type, though without overt ppl. It adds to the somewhat slant syntax of the simile versus the frame that both contain a loc. (ávyo vā́reṣu in the frame), but the locc. have different functions. In fact ávyo vā́reṣu “onto the sheep’s fleece” expresses the goal of the sprinkling and is functionally parallel to vājayúm in the simile.
