Because it begins the second 5-syllable pāda, bhávā is correctly accented.

svàr ṇá jyótiḥ could be take as a quasi-compound in the Re mode, or it is possible that svàr indirectly continues an old gen. sg. See comm. ad II.35.6. Or svàr and jyótiḥ can be taken not as a single expression but syntactically separate, as Old (SBE) and WG do in different ways. I weakly favor the gen. interpr.
