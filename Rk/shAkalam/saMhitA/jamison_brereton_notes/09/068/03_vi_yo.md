As indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. significantly enlarges Soma’s domain: in vs. 2 he circles around the filter at the ritual; in vs. 3 he journeys across the two world halves, Heaven and Earth -- and in fact makes them swell up with his “imperishable milk” (the soma juice itself, presumably).

ákṣitā is most likely instr. sg. with páyasā, on the basis of IX.31.5 páyaḥ ...

duduhré ákṣitam, though Old suggests the possibility that it would be dual nom./acc. Although this would make reasonable contextual sense -- the two imperishable worlds -- it would need to be fem. and therefore *ákṣite. Old floats the possibility that the preceding dual adj. sākaṃvṛ́dhā could have influenced the ending. But on the whole, since páyas- ákṣita- is found elsewhere, it seems best to stick with that grammatically acceptable alternative.

The root affiliation of the intens. part. vivévidat is disputed. Though Gr assigns it to √vid ‘find’, Ge, Re (explicitly in his n.), Lü (228-29) take it to √vid ‘know’ (“Der … genau kennt”; “qui discernes”). I follow Schaef (183-84) (and Gr) in taking it to √vid ‘find’; the point, I think, is that at every soma-pressing Soma refinds and re-defines the domain he crosses, here encompassing the whole universe. It should be noted that the middle part. to this same intens. stem also governs rájasī in I.72.4 ā́ródasī brhat ̥ ī́vévidānāḥ, though I tr. it ‘ever possessing’ there. See comm. ad loc.
