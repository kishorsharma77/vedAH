There are again a number of ways to construe this vs., and I will concentrate on my own. Given the alternation I see in this hymn between the actions of gods and men, I think (with most) that the 2nd pl. subj. of prá … kṛṇudhvam is back to the mortal ritual officiants (as in 3cd), rather than the gods (as in 5a). I also take prá kṛṇudhvam to be the verb of all of abc, reinforced by prá opening b. This further means that the nominatives of c (iṣudhyáva ṛtasā́paḥ) refer to the mortals and the púraṃdhīḥ is acc. pl., not nom. as many take it. Crucial to this interpr. is the parallel cited by Old, X.64.7 prá vo vā́yuṃ rathayújaṃ púraṃdhiṃ, stómaiḥ krṇ̥ udhvam sakhyā́ya pūṣáṇam. “Set in front with your praises Vāyu, who hitches up the chariot, Plenitude, (and) Pūṣan for partnership,” with clear acc. púraṃdhim a parallel obj.

with vā́yuṃ rathayújam (as here) to prá … kṛṇudhvam.

I then take d as displaying the usual reciprocity found elsewhere in the hymn, but with a grammatical twist. The last set of divine beings honored by mortals, the acc. object púraṃdhi- of c, are, in my opinion, the unexpressed subjects of d and participate in a grammatical play. The noun púraṃdhi- is fem., though it is at most the animatization of an abstract ‘plenitude, abundance’. Furthermore, it looks synchronically like a cmpd. with a form of √dhā, even though that is not the current standard etym. (cf. EWA s.v.). I therefore think that the pl. obj. púraṃdhīḥ of pāda c, reconfigured as subjects of d, are depicted as explicitly female -- as ‘good wives’ (vásvīḥ … pátnīḥ) -- and serve as subject to a form of √dhā (dhuḥ) folketymologically extracted from púraṃdhi-. The unexpressed obj. is then (missegmented) *púram *‘plenty’. As was discussed ad vs. 5, dhuḥ also participates in a figure with dhiyé that reverses dadhīta dhī́ḥ in 5d.

I do not entirely understand the position of ā́, which appears to be a preverb with dhuḥ (so Gr), but appears to have been moved in tmesis to a position adjacent neither to a metrical boundary nor to a syntactic one (though this would be easier to argue). It may have been flipped (from a putative *dhiyé ā́dhuḥ) to allow the figure just discussed (dhiyé dhuḥ picking up 5b dadhīta dhī́ḥ).
