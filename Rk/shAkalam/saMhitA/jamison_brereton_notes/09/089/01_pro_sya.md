The explicitly conjoined loc. phrase mātúr upásthe vána ā́ca “in the lap of the mother and in the wood” is a bit puzzling; the ca implies that the two terms belong to a natural or reasonably comprehensible constructed class. Ge (n. 1d) suggests that “mother” refers to the earth, that is, (he further specifies) the surface of the ground or the Vedi, while “wood” refers to the wooden cup. The latter is quite likely, but I prefer Ge’s 2nd suggestion for the former - that “mother” here refers to Aditi. The phrase upásthe áditeḥ is found 3x in IX (26.1, 71.5, 74.5) as well as 2x in X. Although the exact referent is not entirely clear (see JPB, Ādityas 238-41), it obviously refers to something on the ritual ground or to the ritual ground itself. Aditi is of course the archetypal mother, so “of the mother” is an easy substitute “of Aditi” in the phrase. The referent would be more specific that simply “of the earth,” which could cover a lot of ground, as it were. Alternatively, if the mother = earth, this could be a reference to the soma plant growing on the earth, but the ritual setting of the vs. seems too insistent to allow that - though see 2d.
