Soma Pavamāna
Medhyātithi Kāṇva
6 verses: gāyatrī
The double affiliation of Soma with the ritual and cosmic realms leads off the  hymn: in verse 1 he performs major cosmogonic deeds while participating in his  ritual preparation, mixing with milk and being washed in water. This twofold theme  continues through the hymn, as, for example, in verse 4 where Soma begets the gods  while being poured in the filter. The hymn ends (vs. 6) with a wish for the same  material benefits found in the preceding hymn, IX.41.4.
## 1
Begetting the luminous realms of heaven, begetting the sun in the waters, clothing himself in cows, in the waters—the tawny one—
## 2
He, by means of an age-old thought, a god from among the gods,
purifies himself in a stream, when pressed.
## 3
For the ever-increasing victor [=Indra] to win the prize, they purify  themselves—
the thousand-faceted soma juices.
## 4
Milking out his age-old milk, he is poured around into the filter.
Roaring, he has begotten the gods.
## 5
Toward all desirable things, toward the gods who become strong through truth. Soma rushes while he is being purified.
## 6
O Soma, when you are pressed, bring us (wealth) in cattle, in heroes, in  horses and prizes,
and lofty refreshments in purifying yourself.
