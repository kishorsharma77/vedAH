rathín- should of course mean ‘possessing chariots’ or express some looser association with a chariot or chariots (such as Re’s “carried on chariots”) but since there’s no obvious association of refreshments with chariots, an idiomatic and figurative use like Ge’s “wagenvoll” seems appropriate - hence my “by the cartload.”
