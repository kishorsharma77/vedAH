I take the force of purā́+ PRES as past progressive / habitual: “was always speaking, used to speak.” Since the verse contrasts the previous behavior of the speaker (a good ritualist, a hard-working poet) with his current mentally unhinged state, I take tám mā as “this (same) me” -- -- identifying the new careworn me with the old unfazed me. However, the nearly rhyming 8a (see below) may have had something to do with the tám here.

Note that ādhíyaḥ occupies the same metrical position as dūḍhíyaḥ in 6d.
