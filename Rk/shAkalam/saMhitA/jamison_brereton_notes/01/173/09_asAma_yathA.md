The yáthā purpose clauses of this vs. are to be roughly construed with the initial evā́of 8a.

Inspired by Ge, I read instr. ena in two different ways, as accompaniment in pāda a and as indirect agent in b.

Note also the decomposed narā́ṃ ná śáṃsaiḥ (also 10a) recalling nárā-śáṃsa-.

For further disc. of these expressions see comm. ad II.34.6 and VI.24.2.

The curious hapax vandane-ṣṭhā́- ‘standing on praise’ must be a play on the phonologically similar, likewise hapax vandhure-ṣṭhā́- ‘standing on the chariot box’ (III.43.1), which is modeled on the venerable rathe-ṣṭhā́- ‘standing on the chariot’, two forms of which appear earlier in this hymn (4d, 5b).

The part. náyamāna(ḥ) is identical to the form in 3c, but there the part. is clearly passive, and here such a reading is well-nigh impossible to impose. WG’s tr.

has a self-beneficial meaning, “indem er (seine) Preissprüche mit sich führt,” but even that seems contextually difficult -- although I guess any praises Indra “leads” are ultimately for him. For leading song, see gāthā-nī́- (I.190.1 [also Agastya],VIII.92.2), the latter also of Indra.
