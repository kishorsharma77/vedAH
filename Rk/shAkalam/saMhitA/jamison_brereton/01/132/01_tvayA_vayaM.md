With you, bounteous Indra, aided by you, may we overcome those who  do battle over the foremost stakes—may we win against those who  
seek to win.  
On this, the nearest day speak on behalf of the soma-presser.  
At this sacrifice may we pull out the perfect (“hand” of dice) at the  
match—seeking the prize, (may we pull out) the perfect one at  
the match.
