Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Most of the hymn is devoted to generic praise of Indra, and especially of his immense  proportions (see the nicely balanced rhetoric of the middle verse 3). The last verse and  a half (4cd, 5) turn to the ritual situation, the early-morning soma-pressing for Indra.
## 1
Of you, the fighter, the bull, the sovereign king, the strong youth,  stalwart, ardent,
of the unaging bearer of the mace—great are the manly deeds of you, o  Indra, famous and great.
## 2
You are great, you buffalo, with your bullish powers—winning the spoils,  you strong one, overwhelming the others.
As sole king of all creation, cause the peoples to fight and to dwell in peace. 3. He projects in his dimensions, while shining; he projects on all sides,  unopposable by the gods;
Indra projects with his greatness beyond heaven, beyond earth;
projects beyond the great broad atmosphere—he who possesses the
silvery drink.
## 4
Him—broad, deep, over(whelmingly) strong (even) at birth,
encompassing all, a well of thoughts—
Indra—do the pressed soma drinks enter early in the day, like streams  the sea.
## 5
The soma that Heaven and Earth bear, like a mother an embryo, with  longing for you, Indra,
that do the Adhvaryus impel to you, that do they groom, o bull, for you  to drink.
