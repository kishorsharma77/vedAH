JPB suggests that the “face of the demon” spreading out against Indra is hood of the cobra, namely Vṛtra.

The referent of the expression beginning b, máhi jajñānám “having been born great,” is entirely ambiguous. It may be, as the publ. tr. takes it, an acc. with tvā, referring to Indra. Or it may be, as Gr and Ge take it, a neut. nom. modifying the neut.

s-stem pā́jaḥ. Technically speaking, of course, máhi is neut. and might therefore give weight to the latter possibility. But máhi can be adverbial here, evoking the apparently fixed expression máhi jātám (I.163.1, III.31.3, cf. I.156.2); cf. also V.60.3 máhi vṛddháḥ ‘grown great’. I now think the ambigity is meant, and the phrase can apply to either of the antagonists (or rather, in the case of the rakṣás-) its visage. The ambiguity is hard to convey in tr.; perhaps “… (each) born great.” The two verbs in the first hemistich, abhí … ví tasthe# and … abhí … tiṣṭha#, belong to the same root (√sthā), are positioned identically, and differ fairly minimally from each other: tense-aspect stem, voice, person, as well as an extra preverb with the first. Unfortunately the etymological connection can’t be easily capture in tr.: “has stood wide against you” is unidiomatic and opaque.

The 2nd hemistich seems implicitly to convey that our anxieties about our intimacy with Indra were well-founded. In 5ab our forebears were identified as Indra’s “ancient comrades” (pratnā́saḥ … sákhāyaḥ), with later generations apparently grandfathered into this select group (5cd). But here we learn who Indra’s “ancient comrade” really is — his mace: táva pratnéna yújyena sákhyā vájreṇa.
