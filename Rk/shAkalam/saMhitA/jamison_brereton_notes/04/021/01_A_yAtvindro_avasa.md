As indicated in the publ. tr., this vs. bears some resemblance to the first vs. of the preceding hymn: our first pāda ā́yātu índró ‘vasa úpa naḥ more or less lexically matches IV.20.1ab ā́na índro … ávase yāsat. See also vs. 3 below.

The second hemistich is syntactically problematic; see Old’s extensive n. The problem is that both nom. sg. vāvṛdhānáḥ and the gen. sg. rel. prn. yásya appear to refer to Indra. Ge interprets yásya as a reflexive rel. (see n. 1c): “der erstarkt seine vielen Kräfte,” but not only am I not aware of other reflexive uses of the relative, but this tr. requires that the med. participle vāvṛdhāná- be transitive, which it is usually not (though, to be fair, a reflexive transitive would probably require middle voice).

Although the publ. tr. is syntactically trickier (by cutting the pāda into two syntactic pieces), it avoids both problems by taking the participle as a separate clause (“when he has grown strong”) and the antecedent to yásya in a rel. clause that begins with táviṣīḥ. In this interpr. táviṣīḥ … pūrvī́ḥ is nom., not acc. The relative also has domain over the clause in d, with yásya limiting kṣatrám, which is taken as a nom., not acc. as in most tr. Ge’s “wie der Himmel seine überlegene Herrschaft entfalten möge” also violates the standard construction of similes, by making the simile clausal, with the verb púṣyāt in the simile seeming to correspond to the participle vāvṛdhānáḥ in the frame. (WG’s tr. of d avoids this problem; their rendering is quite similar to the publ. tr.)
