The two -várdhana- compounds express something of the same type of role reversal found in the last hymn, where the help given by Indra and received by Indra became conflated. Here we might expect Indra to be strengthened by the praises and recitations, rather than strengthening them. And in fact, contrary to grammar, both Gr and Ge so interpret the compounds (Gr ‘am Loblied sich erlabend’, Ge “Denn dir sind … die Lobgesänge, die Lobgedichte eine Stärkung”). But -ananominals have transitive-causative force and are associated with -áya- verb stems, and in compounds their first member serves as object. See other -várdhanacompounds such as nṛmṇa-várdhana- ‘strengthening manly powers’ (II.36.5), paśuvárdhana- ‘strengthening livestock’ (IX.94.1), as well as numerous other stems such as yajña-sā́dhana- ‘making the sacrifice succeed’ (2x). If we stay true to the grammar, the point is that Indra, by his presence at the sacrifice and his willingness to receive praise, strengthens the products of his praisers, and this in turn creates bhadrá- for them, as pāda c says.
