Agricultural Divinities
Vāmadeva Gautama
8 verses: anuṣṭubh 1, 4, 6–7; triṣṭubh 2–3, 8; puraüṣṇih 5
This hymn is in a variety of meters, alternating throughout the poem, and it is  dedicated to a number of different divinities related to agriculture. With its num ber of verses it is out of place in the collection, and its subject matter and tone  are more “popular” than those of the core R̥gveda. It is not possible to determine  whether the hymn we have now was assembled out of several separate hymns, but  at least verses 1–3, dedicated to the Lord of the Field, hang together, though they  are not metrically uniform. A curious feature in the later part of the hymn is the
dual address (via a dual dvandva compound) to “Prosperity and Plow” (vss. 5, 7). Hymns like this give us precious glimpses into everyday life and the technical ter minology of particular professions. The hymn is notable also for its address to the  Furrow (vs. 6, see also 7), the first appearance of the feminine noun sī́tā, renowned  in later Sanskrit of course as the name of Rāma’s noble wife in the Rāmāyaṇa.
