The s-stem neut. júvas- is a hapax, contrasting with the more conventionally formed and somewhat better attested jávas-. The zero-gr. root syllable is of course anomalous (see AiG II.2.232, without explanation), though see nearby dúvaḥ (vs. 3b), whatever its source. It may owe its form (or have been encouraged in maintaining its form) by the properly formed homonymous root noun pl. (vayo-)júvaḥ (to -jū́-) in the same metrical position in 26a below, as well as the aforementioned dúvaḥ also in the same position in 3b (cf. also ābhúvaḥ 27a, mayobhúvam 28a). A somewhat similar explan. is given by Re. Given the contextual triggers in this passage, it is probably wise not to invest too much in a deep diachronic account of the anomalous root syllable.

The simile in b, rūpáṃ ná (or rūpáṃ ná várcase), is difficult to interpr. Ge simply renders it literally “wie Schönheit unserem Aussehen,” but it is unclear to me what the basis of comparison is. Re’s rendering goes to the opposite extreme, with a flurry of parentheses: “comme (on ajoute) la forme-concrète pour (donner) l'éclat (à une idée).” My own interpr.

arises from the parallelism between vss. 17 and 18. In the former we ask Soma to bring material goods, esp. livestock. Here in pāda a we request abstract qualities, “strength and speed,” and I suggest that rūpáṃ ná “as if (in) physical form” is assimiliating them to the material goods of the previous vs. Re’s alt. interpr., given at the end of his n., “apporte-nous force et vitesse, tel un objet-concret,” is similar and preferable to his more elaborate first interpr.
