Indra and Agni
Nābhāka Kāṇva
12 verses: mahāpaṅkti, except śakvarī 2 and triṣṭubh 12
Unlike many Indra and Agni hymns, in this one the two divinities achieve some  measure of independence, with the more significant role falling to Indra, who is  mentioned alone in several verses, in part or wholly (2, 5, 6, 9, 10). Much of the  content is martial, appropriate to Indra, and also more appropriate to the Nābhāka  refrain than any other of the Nābhāka hymns. The freeing and winning of the  waters is celebrated several times (vss. 5, 8, 10/11). There are several paired verses: 4  and 5 where Nābhāka is mentioned by name, and 10/11, the first to Indra, the sec
ond, almost identical, to Agni. The hymn ends with a verse in a different meter,  without the refrain, that summarizes the hymn that precedes, as is often the case.
