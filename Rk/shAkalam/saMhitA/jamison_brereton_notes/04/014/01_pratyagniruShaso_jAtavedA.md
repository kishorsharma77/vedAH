The opening of the verse, práty agnír uṣásaḥ, matches that of 13.1 práty agnír uṣásām, though the difference in case of the dawn words signals that the verses will veer in slightly different directions. Both also share the verb akhyat, but in 13.1 it ends the first pāda, while in 14.1 it opens the 2nd pāda (accented ákhyat).

The 2nd half vss. of the two hymns deviate more, though both concern the Aśvins and contain the verb yātam (accented yātám in 13.1c). Sūrya (13.2d) is absent from 14.1.
