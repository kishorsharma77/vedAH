For this verse cf. VIII.32.2, 26-27. Gr takes niṣṭúraḥ as nom. pl., and Ge apparently follows this analysis, taking it as indicating the designated destroyers of Indra (“Diese sollen ... (deine) Niederstrecker sein”; sim. Scar 539, 642, though with more machinery). But I consider it rather a gen. sg. modifying a gapped gen. sg.

referring to Indra - quite possibly by haplology from té *te. The only other occurrence of the stem is in the dative and modifies Indra, in a verse immediately following an Emuṣa verse: … ugrā́ya niṣṭúre “… to the strong one who lays low.”
