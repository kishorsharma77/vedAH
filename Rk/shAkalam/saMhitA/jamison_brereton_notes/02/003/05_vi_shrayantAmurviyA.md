As Old points out, suprāyaṇá- is metrically bad here and worse in several other occurrences; it should be read *suprayāṇá-, which presumably belongs to √yā, not √i.

I take the adjectives in d (yaśásaṃ suvī́ram) as proleptic, the result of the purification, though this interpr. isn’t strictly necessary.
