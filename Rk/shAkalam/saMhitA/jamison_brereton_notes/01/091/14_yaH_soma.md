Although it is tempting to take dákṣa- as adjectival here (so Ge, WG), I am somewhat dubious that this stem can be an adjective, and in any case the emphasis on the skill associated with Soma in this hymn (vss. 2b, 3d, 7c) suggests a nominal reading here. Although the pairing of an abstract quality (skill) with an animate being (poet) might seem awkward, I see it as a variant reprise of 2ab, where krátu- (‘intention’) and dákṣa- were paired; as discussed ad I.2.7-9, krátu- and dákṣa- are two of the three qualities required to bring an action about and are regularly associated. Here kaví- stands in for krátu-. This substitution is enabled by the syntagm “the poet’s krátu-, as in the cmpd. kaví-kratu-. (Re’s interpr. is similar; see his n.)
