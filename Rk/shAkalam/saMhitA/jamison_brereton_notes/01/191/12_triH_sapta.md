Sāy. suggests that the “little sparks” (viṣpuliṅgaká-) are little sparrows.

This makes sense not only because of the birds in vss. 11 and 14, but because of the visual effect of flocks of small birds feeding: esp. when they are in bushes or underbrush they can burst up, out, and around at random almost like sparks. The viṣor course also recalls viṣá- ‘poison’. I do not understand why there are 21 of them, save for the fact that thrice seven is a satisfying number. Similar numbers are found in the next two vss.
