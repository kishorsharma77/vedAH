We are yours, Indra—as are the superior men born as a troop  
[=Maruts?] and the driving-chariots.  
As a consummate warrior he [=Indra] should come here to us, o you  with the serpent’s hiss—dear, like Bhaga to be invoked at our forays  [/dear like a portion to be offered at our (ritual) presentations].
