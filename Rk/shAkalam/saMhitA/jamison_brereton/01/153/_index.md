Mitra and Varuṇa
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
4 verses: triṣṭubh
This little collection of Dīrghatamas’s Mitra-Varuṇa hymns (I.151–153), which  have especially concerned their presence at and participation in the sacrifice, ends  with this short piece announcing the present sacrifice offered to the two gods. It  focuses on the ritual details and on the priestly personnel.
