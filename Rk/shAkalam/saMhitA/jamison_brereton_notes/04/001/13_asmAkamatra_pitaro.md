This is the first of the Vala myth vss. As noted in the publ. intro., the actors throughout must be the Aṅgirases, but they are never named.

The curious phrase ṛtám āśuṣānā́ḥ “panting over the truth” occurs three times in IV.1-2 (also 2.14, 16). It expresses the energy and effort of the Aṅgirases in singing the true song that opened the Vala cave and freed the cows. See Lü (514-15).

The med. part. huvāná- is ordinarily passive in value; pace Gr, only VII.30.3 is clearly trans. I therefore take huvānā́ḥ here as fem. acc. pl. modifying uṣásaḥ in passive sense. The standard interpr. is masc. nom. pl. in trans. value, ‘calling to’.

This would of course make just as much sense; my choice is based on the usage of the preponderance of occurrences of the stem.
