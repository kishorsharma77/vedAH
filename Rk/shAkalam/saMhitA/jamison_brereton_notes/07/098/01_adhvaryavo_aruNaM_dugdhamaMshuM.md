Verbal forms of the root √pā ‘drink’ do not appear with the preverb áva in the RV or, indeed, elsewhere in Skt. But this noun stem avapā́na- is found 5x in the RV (I.136.4, VII.98.1, VIII.4.10, X.43.2, 106.2); in 3 of these passages (all but I.136.4, X.43.2) it is used of a wild beast come to drink; cf. (besides our passage) VIII.4.10 ṛ́ṣyo ná tṛ́ṣyann avapā́nam ā́gahi “like a thirsting antelope, come to the drinking (hole).” These specialized contexts suggest that rather than meaning simply “das Trinken, der Trunk” (Gr), the stem refers to a drinking hole frequented by wild animals (so already MonWms). The preverb áva ‘down’ would refer to the physical stance of animals lowering their heads to drink. The image of Indra beating buffalos to a watering hole is rather charming.
