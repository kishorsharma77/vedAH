title = "17-19"

As noted in the publ. intro., the patron’s name Rathavīti (‘pursuit of the chariot’?) in 18, 19 is punned upon. In 17 (before he is explicitly mentioned, though the patronymic Dārbhya would presumably evoke him) Night is asked to carry the hymns “like a charioteer” (rathī́r iva); in 18 the 2nd cmpd. member -vīti- is derived from the same root √vī ‘pursue’ that supplies the verb ápa veti ‘goes off track’.
