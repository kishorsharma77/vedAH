The first pāda contains an example of an embedded relative that is difficult to sidestep: in ásmai vayáṃ yád vāvā́na tád viviṣma the first two words dat. ásmai and nom. vayám rightly belong to the main cl. tád viviṣma “we toil at that,” which follows the dependent cl. yád vāvā́na “what he holds dear.” The two preposed pronouns set the participants and case roles for the vs. (see esp. índrāya opening b and d, as well as the two 1st pl. verbs viviṣma and stumasi) -- hence my tr. as a cleft construction -- but the construction still seems unusual.

The opening of c, suté sóme stumasi, takes the same elements found in the figure in vs. 1ab and plays on different phonological similarities. Here sut(é) and stu(masi) are scrambled versions of each other, while sóme stands somewhat apart.
