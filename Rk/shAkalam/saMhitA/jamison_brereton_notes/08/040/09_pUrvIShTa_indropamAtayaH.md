In my interpr. the verse is structured by two complementary pairings of reciprocal gifts between “us” and Indra. Both involve Indra’s gifts (úpamātayaḥ a, āpṛ́caḥ d) and our praiseful thoughts (práśastayaḥ b, dhíyaḥ e).

úpamāti- is variously rendered, but I take it to úpa √mā ‘mete out’; cf., e.g., VII.26.5 sahasríṇa úpa no māhi vā́jān “mete out prizes to us in thousands.” Ge’s ‘Zuwendungen’ (‘contributions, donations’, but also ‘care’) could belong either to √mā or to √man, but I surmise he links it to the former. Both Gr and Re connect it to the realm of speech/thought (‘Anrede’ and ‘pensées-appliquées’ respectively) with Gr explicitly positing a root affiliation with √man. Re gives no disc. in his comm. ad loc. (EVP 14), but in EVP 16 (ad IV.43.4) he rejects a root affiliation with √mā. Cf. also his comments in EVP 13.155 (ad VIII.60.11). A root syllable mā cannot be derived from the aniṭ root √man in any straightforward fashion, though AiG II.2.630 derives both úpamāti- and abhímāti- from -mati- via metrical lengthening, citing Meillet. Metrical lengthening is, of course, a non-explanation except under very controlled conditions, and the fact that other compounds with -mati- (e.g., metrically identical ánumati-) maintain the short vowel make it even less likely in this case.

In both d and e I supply ‘many’, based on the parallelism with ab pūrvī́ḥ …, pūrvī́ḥ ... HvN’s loosing of the sandhi in d as vīrásya apṛ́caḥ is incorrect: the initial vowel is ā-, which is supported by the meter and so given by the Pp (see Scar 324).

Ge takes āpṛ́caḥ as adjectival modifying dhíyaḥ, but I follow Old’s interpr. (so also Scar 324-25) as a nom. act.; the vásvaḥ with it is an objective gen., the vīrásya a subjective gen.
