For this vs. see publ. intro.; as pointed out there, the simile in c can either refer to sex or to childbirth.

It is interesting that sakthā́ni is plural. Although there are plural ‘men’ (náraḥ) and therefore twice as many thighs as men, in Classical Sanskrit it is my impression that the dual would ordinarily be used in such a situation, where a number of men each spread their two thighs. RV seems more flexible.
