salalū́ka- is yet another peculiar word that brings our interpr. to a standstill.

The current standard interpr. is “indulgence, patience” vel sim. (Ge [/WG] “Nachsicht”). I do not understand where such a meaning would come from.

Mayrhofer (KEWA s.v.) suggests √sṛ in the meaning ‘sich erstrecken’, but the semantic channel from one to the other seems blocked to me. Although a deriv. from √sṛ seems likely, a more literal sense of that root, ‘run, flow’, provides better sense.

(The older interpr. of the word was ‘zerflossen’ or ‘umherschweifend’ [Gr, etc.].) Both the l’s and the affective -ū́ka-suffix suggest a slangy or low-register word -- hence my “send scooting.” Gr suggests a preform *salsalū́ka-, presumably because - ū́ka- is often added to intensively reduplicated stems (see AiG II.2.498)(cf. jāgarū́kaIII.54.7). This seems possible (though not, of course, necessary), and “send scooting” is also meant to reflect an intensive/iterative sense. Note that salalū́kam phonologically resembles sahámūlam in pāda a (in almost the same metrical position), which may help account for the presence of salalū́kam in the vs. and could also have facilitated a dissimilation from *salsalū́kam.
