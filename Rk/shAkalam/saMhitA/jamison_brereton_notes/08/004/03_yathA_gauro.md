apā́is one of the few singular forms of the áp- ‘water’ stem.

On íriṇa- as ‘salt-pocket’, see EWA s.v., citing esp. Falk, Bruderschaft.

VIII contains two other occurrences of āpitvá-, both clearly derived from āpí- ‘friend’ and meaning ‘friendship’ (VIII.20.22, 21.13), but the presence of the temporal designation prapitvá- here suggests a similar temporal analysis, ā-pitvá-. It is surely a pun, as indicated in the publ. tr.
