How to construe maháḥ in c is not clear. I tentatively take it as the gen. sg.

of máh- and supply ‘prize’ or “wealth’. Lub groups it with the adverbial maháḥ ‘greatly’, which is also possible. I do not understand how Ge takes it grammatically, given his tr. “der grosse Beute macht,” which must somehow be rendering mahó vājínam.
