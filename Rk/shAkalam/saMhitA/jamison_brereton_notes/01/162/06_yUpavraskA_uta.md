The list of personnel involved in the sacrifice here includes some apparently marginal and humble roles, perhaps to implicate the largest possible group in the potential blood-guilt of the sacrifice.

I render the utó in d with ‘also’; this is also Klein’s tr., though his disc. of the passage seems to seek a straight conjunctive role (DGRV I.448-49). See the same expression in 12d.
