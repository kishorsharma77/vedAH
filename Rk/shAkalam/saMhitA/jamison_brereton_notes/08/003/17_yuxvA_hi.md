Ge takes parāvátaḥ in b with the second hemistich (“aus der Ferne komme…”), but the idiom √yuj + ablative (“yoke out of X,” that is, hitch up your horses and come from…) is found elsewhere; cf. esp. I.48.7 eṣā́yukta parāvátaḥ, sū́ryasyodáyanād ádhi “This one has hitched herself up from out of the distance, from (the place of) the rising of the sun” (also I.115.4, V.87.4, VII.60.3, 75.4, X.94.12, etc.).

On hí with the imperative, marking that clause as the causal basis for the following imperative clause, see Brereton 2012.
