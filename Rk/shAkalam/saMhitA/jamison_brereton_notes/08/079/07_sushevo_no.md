With Gr I take avātá- as the negated ppl. of √vā ‘become extinguished’, in the sense ‘unextinguishable, unquenchable’, also in I.38.7, 52.4, and 62.10. It is separate from the homonymous avātá- ‘without wind, windless’ in VI.64.4 and X.129.2 and also from differently accented ávāta- (√van ‘win’) ‘unvanquished’. Ge takes the avātá- forms here and in I.38.7 as ‘windless’ (as well as those in VI.64.4 and X.129.2) and in I.52.4 and 62.10 as ‘unvanquishable’. Re takes this occurrence as ‘invincible’; see his disc. ad loc. My interpr. rests partly on semantic, partly on formal grounds. On the one hand, “windless Soma” (or, as Ge has it, “ohne Wind zu machen”) makes no sense to me; on the other, though ‘invincible’ does make sense, I prefer to respect the accent otherwise found with that form, noting also that occurrences of that stem almost always appear with the participle vanván belonging to the same root. As for the occurrences in Maṇḍala I, avātá- once modifies mist (míh- I.38.2), once ‘streams’ (avánīḥ I.62.10, with phonological play), and once Indra’s śúṣmāḥ (I.52.4, there tr. ‘gusts’). In all cases (even, or esp., the last) ‘windless’ does not work; the point in all three cases is, I think, that the entity does not “go out”

-- dissipate or disappear. Exactly how this applies to Soma here is less clear, but I
assume that the point is that Soma is reliably present and available.
