All Gods  
Atri Bhauma  
20 verses: triṣṭubh, except atijagatī 16–17, ekapadā virāj 20  
This hymn is quite intricate on the verbal level, though in paraphrase and in  translation it may seem to lack interest. Every verse (but 17) names at least one  divinity—many verses have several—chosen from among both the most promi nent gods of the Vedic pantheon (e.g., Mitra and Varuṇa in vs. 1) and distinctly  marginal figures like Āptya (vs. 9). There does not seem to be any one dominant  god or set of gods: though the Maruts are mentioned more than any other gods  (vss. 2, 5, 11, 13, 16), there is little particularly Marutian vocabulary or imagery.  (It might be remembered, however, that the longest series of Marut hymns in the  R̥gveda, the Śyāvāśva hymns of remarkable poetic quality, immediately follow the  All God hymns in this maṇḍala [V.52–61]). The content of the hymn as a whole  seldom deviates from invitations to the sacrifice with promises of offerings, and  prayers for divine gifts in return. Verses 16–17 are in a different meter and seem to  be bringing the hymn to a close, especially 17, in which, as often, the poet makes  a meta-reference to the hymn just concluded. If this is so, verses 18–20 are an  afterthought.  
The seemingly unordered series of gods who receive the honor of a verse (or part  thereof) may exemplify a covert theme of choice or alternatives, underlined by the  

use of the simple conjunction “or” (vā) as the verbal “hero” of the beginning of the  hymn (vss. 1–3, returning at the end, vss. 15, 19).  
Unfortunately other pieces of verbal play are essentially untranslatable, like  the unusual sequence of two monosyllables at the end of the first half-verse of  verse 1:... vā dé (“or...to be given”), which, scrambled, produces the target of the  hymn: devā(ḥ) “gods.”
