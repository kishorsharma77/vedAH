The parallel but oddly assorted dative phrases kṣáyāya pányase “to/for the praiseworthy dwelling place’ and jánāya … adrúhe “to/for the race without deceit” I take as a possible elaboration on the disjunctive pair “men and gods.” Although Re wants the latter to refer to “l’être-humain,” he himself points out that adrúh- is generally an epithet of the gods (though see adrúhaḥ with ‘rivers’ in 4b). By contrast to “the race without deceit [= gods],” kṣáya- may refer to the ritual ground as the ‘dwelling place’ and by extension to the humans who create and inhabit it.
