On krāṇā́as instr. see comm. ad IX.86.19. It is echoed by the instr. krátvā in the ring-compositional final vs., 8a. As noted ad IX.86.19, with Lü and Re (see also Tichy Kl.Sch 210) but contra Ge, I construe mahī́nām with śíśuḥ here.

As noted in the publ. intro., the phrase hinvánn ṛtásya dī́dhitim in b forms a ring with the same phrase in the final vs. of the hymn, 8c. Both occurrence fill a pāda, but the repetition in 8 is followed by the 4-syl. extension prā́dhavaré (i.e., prá adhvaré), which needs to be integrated into the clause.

It is not entirely clear what “all the dear things” are that Soma encompasses in c, but on the basis of vs. 2 they may be Soma’s domains (dhā́man-) or places, i.e., the various stations on the ritual ground that the soma passes through.

The 4-syl. extension in this vs., ádha dvitā́, has the look of a new syntactic unit, since ádha is almost always pāda/clause initial, but it also has to be integrated into what precedes.
