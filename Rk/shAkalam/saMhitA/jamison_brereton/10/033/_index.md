Lament of a Singer [Anukramaṇı: All Gods 1, Indra ̄ 2–3, Dānastuti of Kurusravan ́ ̣a Trāsadasyava 4–5, Upamasravas ́ Mitrātithiputra 6–9]  
Kavaṣa Ailūṣa  
9 verses: triṣṭubh 1, br̥hatī 2, satobr̥hatī 3, gāyatrī 4–9  
A poignant yet proud 1st-person lament of a poet whose patron has died, the hymn  also serves as a sort of job application to his erstwhile patron’s son. The progress of  the poem is marked by changes in meter. In the first verse the poet remembers his for mer privileged position and, in its last pāda, the sudden advent of disaster. The next  two verses (a pragātha) describes his present miserable state (in terms found also in  part in I.105.8) and begs Indra for help. In the last six verses, in gāyatrī, the poet first  recalls how he “chose” (a telling expression) his former patron Kuruśravaṇa (vss. 4–6).  He then introduces himself to the son, Upamaśravas (vs. 7), but returns in the final  two verses (8–9) to his helpless sorrow over the death of his patron and companion.
