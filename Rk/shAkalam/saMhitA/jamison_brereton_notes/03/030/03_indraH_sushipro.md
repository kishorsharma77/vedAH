The 2nd member of tuvikūrmí-, an epithet of Indra, is generally now derived from the seṭ root √cari , a derivation already found in AiG I.24, 141, 152 -- hence my ‘powerfully ranging’. See EWA s.v. tuvikūrmí-. The older deriv. from √kṛ (e.g., Gr., Wh Rts; explicitly rejected by AiG II.2.776) is nonetheless still reflected in the standard tr.: Ge “der Tatenreiche,” Re (with hesitation) “aux actes (?) puissants,” WG “der mächtig Wirkende” -- even though AiG I (1896) predates all of them by a good margin, well over a century in the case of WG! There is number incongruence between the neut. sg. yád of the rel. clause and neut. pl. tyā́… vīryā̀ṇi. The yád is, as it were, an anticipatory collective: “what(ever) you did … where are those deeds?”
