The conjoined verbs in ab, mandayā … papráthaś ca, are in different moods, imperative and subjunctive respectively. Or so it seems: in the sandhi context mandayā góbhiḥ the apparent impv. mandayā could represent subjunctive *mandayās.

However, I don’t think this is necessary; impv. and subj. are both future-oriented moods, and in fact in this passage the pairing functions as a sort of covert conditional: “(if) you invigorate it, it will spread.” Kü (321), fld by WG, construes candrávatā rā́dhasā with the 2nd verb, but both the accent on papráthaḥ and the position of the ca make it clear that papráthaḥ must begin a new clause.
