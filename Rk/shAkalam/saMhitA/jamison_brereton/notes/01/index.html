  <p>[I.1 JPB]
I.2: Vāyu, etc. (Praügaśastra)
The recipients of the various tṛcas making up these two rather simple hymns
are clearly signalled. All three verses making up the first tṛca to Vāyu (vss. 1-3) open
with a voc. vāyo; the second tṛca (to Indra and Vāyu, vss. 4-6) opens with the voc.
índravāyū, while the next two begin with the famous “Vāyav Indraś ca” construction
(on which see Jamison 1988). The pattern is varied in the Mitra and Varuṇa tṛca (7-
9), with the conjoined accusatives mitrám and váruṇaṃ ca opening the first and
second pādas of vs. 7, and the dual dvandva mitrā́váruṇā(v) in second position in the
next two verses, first as a vocative, then as a nominative.
There appears to be some attempt to create bridges between the tṛcas: verses 3
and 4 both sketch a reversal of the usual ritual model; vss. 6 and 7 both concern our
‘insight’ (dhī́).</p>
<h3 id="i22">I.2.2</h3>
<p>Ge. suggests that jarante here can be ambiguous, belonging not only to ‘sing’,
but also to ‘awaken’, with identical present stem. This is possible, but only with an
intransitive sense of ‘awaken’: “the singers awaken / wake up to you,” since the
‘awaken’ present is only intrans. (see Gotō 1987: 150). In any case surely the
primary sense is ‘sing’, given the the etymological figure produced by its
grammatical subj. jaritā́raḥ ‘singers’.</p>
<h3 id="i23">I.2.3</h3>
<p>The difficult words dhénā and prapṛñcatī́complicate the interpretation of this
verse. The former, investigated in detail by H.-P. Schmidt (Gd. Nyberg), is now
generally interpreted as ‘(milk)stream’, rendering Geldner’s ‘lip’ and Renou’s
‘tongue’ out of date. As for prapṛñcatī́, the simplex pṛñcatī́appears in another
Praügaśastra hymn (I.23.16), modifying waters and referring to the mixing of milk
(acc.) with honey (instr.). Given the similarity of context, a direct object referring to
a liquid should be supplied.
What is also puzzling here is in what way the ‘stream’ is Vāyu’s: it should not
originate with him, but rather be destined for him, but then why is the ‘pious man’
apparently receiving the benefit of it? As in the next verse, there seems to be a bit of
role reversal here, with the gods depicted as providing the ritual benefits rather than
receiving them. Presumably the point is that the pious man gets the benefit
secondarily, by having pleased the god, but the dative dāśúṣe is striking, esp. as it is
apparently parallel grammatically (though it cannot be functionally) to the dat.
sómapītaye ending the verse. Although the verse presumably depicts the sacrificer’s
offering of soma to Vāyu to drink, the lexicon and the case usage complicate the
message.</p>
<h3 id="i24">I.2.4</h3>
<p>As noted in the comment on the last verse, the ritual model here is shaken up a
bit: Indra and Vāyu are urged to come with práyobhiḥ, a word generally used of
2
‘pleasurable offerings’ that are presented to the gods and to which they come (cf.
VIII.60.4 abhí práyāṃsi &hellip; gahi). Our translation “with delight,” agreeing with most
other translators, avoids, and conceals, the problem. The gods should not be bringing
práyāṃsi. The little disturbance of the ritual model is confined to these two verses in
this hymn.
The pāda-final position of hí here is unusual, and I have no explanation for it,
esp. as it does not take second position in its clause as is usual.
I.2.7-9: As mentioned in the intro., this tṛca contains the trio dhī́‘insight’ (vs. 7),
krátu- ‘intention’ (vs. 8), and dákṣa- ‘skill’ (vs. 9), the three elements necessary to
conceive and carry out an action. Their interconnection is emphasized by the fact that
all three are in the accusative and each is stationed initial in the last pāda of its verse.
The juxtaposition across vss. 8-9 of krátum (beginning 8c) and kavī́
(beginning 9a) may also be meant to evoke the well-established compound kavíkratu- ‘having the will/resolve of a poet’, ‘having a poet’s purpose’, an occurrence of
which is found in the preceding hymn by the same poet (I.1.5).</p>
<h3 id="i27">I.2.7</h3>
<p>Here and everywhere else it is found, the word riśā́das-, an epithet of various
gods, is opaque. There are currently two competing and entirely different
interpretations: that of Karl Hoffmann (Aufs. 564 n. 16) as ‘discriminating, fastidious’
(&lt; ‘picking at food’) and Paul Thieme’s ‘caring for the stranger’ (Fremdling). See
EWA s.v. The contexts are not diagnostic, and it is probably the case that the epithet
was no longer understood even as it was being deployed (note that it is almost always
pāda-final, possibly a sign of formulaic freezing).
Throughout our translation we have followed the Thieme interpretation, but
not with any great conviction. One thing in favor of the Thieme interpretation is that
the word is regularly applied to one or more of the Ādityas (as here), who might be
expected to show care for humans in their charge. That it is also regularly used of the
less ethically inclined Maruts might give us pause (though these contexts are
generally benevolent ones) – except that ‘fastidious’ is even less a likely quality of
the Maruts than ‘caring for the stranger’.</p>
<h3 id="i28">I.2.8</h3>
<p>The unaccented voc. ṛtāvṛdhāv opening the 2nd pāda has been thus transmitted,
though we would expect *ṛ́tāvṛdhāv. In fact there is a striking string of 13 unaccented
syllables in this hemistich, starting after the first word of the vs., ṛténa (14, counting
-na). See Old, who has no good explanation for the lack of accent on the first word of
the 2nd pāda, though he considers it an old error. It cannot be simply a peculiarity of
this hymn, because I.3.1b (forming part of the Praügaśastra sequence with I.2, as
discussed in the publ. intro.) opens with an initially accented voc. drávatpāṇī (to the
stem dravátpāṇi-).
I.3 (Praügaśastra continued)
As in I.2 the recipients of the various tṛcas are emphatically signalled. In vss.
1-3 to the Aśvins, the voc. áśvinā opens the first two verses, while their alternative
3
name nāsatyā opens the second pāda of the third. The voc. índra opens all three
verses of the next tṛca (4-6). The Viśvedevāḥ tṛca contains three instances of that
phrase: the voc. in 7b, nominatives opening vss. 8 and 9. The final tṛca to Sarasvatī
likewise contains three occurrences of her name in the nominative, but all three end
their pādas (10a, 11c, 12a).</p>
<h3 id="i32">I.3.2</h3>
<p>śávīra- rendered as ‘powerful’ in the publ. tr. But see disc. below ad I.30.17.
dhíṣṇya- and related forms are obscure and much discussed; indeed Ge.
refuses to translate the word. We generally follow the view of Pinault (UTexas Vedic
Workshop), who takes it to mean ‘related to / proper to the holy place’, thence
simply ‘holy’.</p>
<h3 id="i33">I.3.3</h3>
<p>In the compound rudra-vartanī, number is of course neutralized in the first
member. The Maruts are regularly called Rudras (without vṛddhi or derivational
suffix) after their father. The ‘course of the Rudra/Maruts’ is simply a reference to
the midspace (antarikṣa) much frequented by the Maruts, where the Aśvins are now
driving.</p>
<h3 id="i35">I.3.5</h3>
<p>The peculiarly formed stem vāghát- clearly refers to a ritual officient of some
sort, but in the absence of both a set of diagnostic contexts and a convincing
etymology, it is hard to narrow his function down. Because his voice (vā́ṇi-) figures
in a simile (I.88.6 vāgháto ná vā́ṇiḥ); because he is associated with verbal products,
like the bráhmāṇi here; because Vāghats are the agents at vying sacrificial
invocations (e.g., I.36.13 vāghádbhir vihváyāmahe; cf. III.8.10, VIII.5.16); and
because they are associated with the Aṅgirases, the singers in the Vala myth (X.62.7),
we chose to render the term by ‘cantor’, though this is only a guess – esp. since in
most of the occurrences the ritual role and priestly activity are pretty generic. The
word is also twice applied to the Ṛbhus (I.110.4, III.60.4).</p>
<h3 id="i37">I.3.7</h3>
<p>On the voc. of víśva- see comm. ad X.15.6.</p>
<h3 id="i38">I.3.8</h3>
<p>A small grammatical mismatch here: the phrase viśve devā́saḥ and the
adjectives modifying it (aptúraḥ, tū́rṇayaḥ) are nominatives and should not be the
subject of the imperative ā́ganta. Ge. (and WG) ignore the problem by translating
the nom. as voc. (“Ihr Allgötter”). Although the effect is minor, my translation
reflects the grammatical disjunction by rendering pāda b as an interjection.
Another question is why 7b contains the same 2nd pl. imperative, except with a
different grade of the root: ā́gata vs. ā́ganta. Both forms are reasonably well
attested, with 7b a repeated pāda (=II.41.13a, VI.52.7a). Whatever the history of the
distinction, the synchronic distribution seems to be metrical, with ā́gata almost
always final, providing an iambic cadence in dimeter verse, and ā́ganta found earlier
in the verse.
In b tū́rṇayaḥ was carelessly omitted from the tr., which should read “Come
here swiftly…”
4</p>
<h3 id="i39">I.3.9</h3>
<p>I follow the analysis of the hapax éhimāyāsaḥ as a frozen 2nd sg. imperative
phrase, “éhi mā́+yāḥ” (“come! don’t go”), transformed into an adjective in the nom.
pl. masc. – an analysis that goes back at least to Sāyaṇa. Ge also follows this analysis,
though it is somewhat difficult to excavate from his “willkommen und ungern
fortgelassen.” I interpret it as representing the words of the singers’ invitation
regularly heard by the VDs. The other currently competing explanations, as a frozen
phrase “éhi māyā” [better voc. māye?] “come here, magic” (Old) or as a deformation
of áhi-māya- ‘vielgestaltig’ (Gr) [=‘snake-sly’ (J+B)] (BR, followed by Gr), fit less
well into the content of the hymn, which after all focuses on calling the various gods
to the ritual; note the ā́gata, ā́ganta of vss. 7-8 addressed to the same VDs. Support
for this analysis may also come from the next hymn (I.4), attributed to the same poet,
in which successive vss. (3c, 4a) contain the imperatives ā́gahi ‘come here’ and
párehi ‘go away’, with at least the former addressed to the god Indra.
I.3.11-12: Note the contrastive values of the simplex pres. cétantī ‘perceiving, taking
note’ and the -áya-pres. (prá) cetayati ‘makes perceived, reveals’ in successive vss.</p>
<h2 id="i4-indra">I.4 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="i42">I.4.2</h3>
<p>godā́(ḥ) of pāda c echoes godúhe of 1b. I consider pāda c a proverbial
expression – when a rich man is pleased, he gives cows – though it’s obviously
applied to Indra here.</p>
<h3 id="i44">I.4.4</h3>
<p>Striking is the abrupt change of subject of the 2nd sg. imperatives, from Indra
(3c) to an unidentified human companion (4a).
My interpretation differs substantially from those of most others in pāda b. In
my view, the accusative índram marks Indra as the one directly interrogated, rather
than (with most interpretations) the one to be asked about. Most interpretors take
vipaścítam as identifying the person to be interrogated (e.g., Ge. “einen Weisen”),
thus assuming two different referents for the accusative singulars in that pāda: “ask
the wise one about Indra.” I find that unlikely, in part because, though vipaścít- can
be used of humans, it more often qualifies gods.
Taking Indra as the one interrogated has further effects on the interpretation.
For others the relative clause in c has Indra as its subject (yáḥ) and the 2nd ps. te
refers to the human interrogator: it is Indra who is dear(er) to you, the poet, than your
comrades. I, on the other hand, take pāda c as a syntactic hybrid, with an underlying
direct discourse question, directed to Indra, “who [expected káḥ] is your choice from
among your comrades?” incompletely converted into a relative clause in indirect
discourse “ask (Indra) about (the one) who [yáḥ] is your [=Indra’s] choice…” In my
view the 2nd ps. ‘your’ of “your choice” in pāda c refers to Indra, not to the subject of
the imperatives párehi and pṛchā of ab, while Indra is in the 3rd ps in pāda b. (I will
not even contemplate the possibility that pṛchā in b is a 1st ps subjunctive: “Go away.
I will ask / let me ask Indra…”)
5
Although this interpretation complicates the syntax, in my opinion it fits
better into its tṛca and better reflects the relationship between Indra and humans. As
often in Indra contexts, the poet worries that Indra will favor others over the poet
himself, and this verse poses the question directly to Indra: who do you like best?
Indra’s presumed and desired answer is “you!” This answer then allows the poet to
dismiss those who criticize him for not spreading his devotion around to other gods
(vs. 5) and defends this exclusive focus as a good bargain, as the rest of the world has
to admit (vs. 6). The first defense of henotheism?
I should admit, however, that the standard view is somewhat compatible with
my larger interpretation, in that “… ask about Indra, who is your [=poet’s] choice
from among your comrades” could reinforce that message that our focus is only on
Indra, not on other gods. But I do not see how questions about Indra fit with the next
two verses.
I.4.5-6: Most interpretations take these two verses as syntactically parallel (e.g., Ge.
“Mögen … Und mögen …”), but the impv. bruvantu and the opt. vocéyuḥ are surely
doing different things: the imperative is concessive: “let them say / even if they
say &hellip;” while the optative expresses the conclusion that the rest of the world would
have to draw. The parallel utá’s that open these verses might give us pause, but they
may have something like the value “on the one hand … on the other.”</p>
<h3 id="i47">I.4.7</h3>
<p>(JL) The b and c pādas both end with an adjective modifying the implicit object
soma, a compound of the root √mad ‘exhilarate’ (the second time in its byform
mand) and a noun expressing the personal object of the verb, but in exactly opposite
order: nṛ-mā́dana- and mandayát-sakha-, what might be called a “compound
chiasmus.” A less complex etymological figure is found at the beginning of the
verse: āśúm āśáve.</p>
<h3 id="i48">I.4.8</h3>
<p>My occasional tr. of ghaná- as ‘bane’ was inspired by my husband’s treatment
of etymologically related nominal constructions in Greek and Germanic (Watkins
1996: 418ff., 423). I think JL for reminding me of this.</p>
<h3 id="i49">I.4.9</h3>
<p>(JL) Etymological figure also in vā́jeṣu vājínam, immediately followed by
vājáyāmasi, which, however, is synchonically distinct from the ‘prize’ words.</p>
<h3 id="i410">I.4.10</h3>
<p>There may be bit of ring composition here, with 10b supāráḥ echoing the first
word of the hymn, 1a surūpa-.</p>
<h2 id="i5-indra">I.5 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="i51">I.5.1</h3>
<p>Seems deliberately to echo the last vs. of the preceding hymn (I.4.10), with
pāda b índram abhí prá gāyata “sing forth to Indra” matching I.4.10c tásmai índrāya
gāyata “sing to him, to Indra” (the difference in case being governed by the presence
of the preverb abhí in I.5.1). I.4.10 is then exactly repeated in I.5.4c. The sákhāyaḥ of
6
I.5.1c also recalls I.4.10b sákhā — though the latter refers to Indra and the former to
the priest-poets. But I.4.4c contains a pl. sákhibhyaḥ, which in our analysis has the
same human referents as I.5.1, showing the reciprocal relation between men and
gods that was one of the points of I.4.</p>
<h3 id="i52">I.5.2</h3>
<p>purūtámam purūṇā́m is pleonastic, meaning literally “the first of many, of the
many ones.”</p>
<h3 id="i53">I.5.3</h3>
<p>My interpretation of these sentences as questions is not overtly marked in the
text, but seems a reasonable use of the subjunctives.</p>
<h3 id="i55">I.5.5</h3>
<p>The double dative sutapā̎vne … vītáye with yanti is more literally “… go to the

<h3 id="i510">I.5.10</h3>
<p>A whiff of ring composition – 10c ī́śānaḥ ‘having control over’ echoes 2b
ī́śānam, both modifying Indra. In 2b the god controls something undeniably positive,
“choice things,” which he will presumably distribute to this favorites. In 10a he
controls “the deadly weapon” that other mortals might wield against us. The identity
of expression ties together the very different sentiments.
I.6 Indra and the Maruts (per Anukr.)
As noted in the intro. the Anukramaṇī’s identification of the divinities as
Indra (1-3, 10), Maruts (4, 6, 8-9), and Indra and Maruts (5, 7) does not conform to
the content of the hymn, which is quite disjointed, but appears to concern, at least in
part, the Vala myth. The Maruts do not seem to figure at all in the hymn; the plural
entities with Indra are probably the Aṅgirases. For my view of the structure (which is
informed by the discussions of Ge and Old), see publ. intro.
I.6.1-2: These verses begin identically (yuñjánti ‘they yoke’), inviting the audience to
equate the action of the two verses.
1b: The referent of the apparent acc. plural tasthúṣaḥ ‘(those) standing still’ is
not given. Ge. (/WG) thinks it refers to stable things on the earth, but if the sun is
referred to in the first pāda, it is more likely to “move around” celestial features than
earthly ones, and the stars or other luminous heavenly bodies are referred to in the
next pāda. Re’s interpretation (flg. Ludwig) of tasthúṣaḥ as an abl. sg. (“from the one
standing still” – “à partir de (l’espace) immobile”) is ingenious and would match the
minor syntactic idiom ‘yoke from ABL’ (e.g., I.115.4 yadéd áyukta harítaḥ
sadhásthāt), so it cannot be dismissed. The ablatives in the final verses (9-10) might
lend weak support for Re’s view.
2b: The hapax compound vípakṣasā is difficult and has been variously
interpreted. The second member, pákṣas- (and related and more common pakṣá-),
can mean either ‘wing’ or ‘side’; the first member, ví-, is most likely the preverb ví,
but in compounds this element has a number of possible meanings: ‘without’, distant’,
‘wide’,‘alternating/opposite/different’, ‘dispersed’. It could also possibly represent
7
ví- ‘bird’, which has been claimed as the first member of some other compounds (see
EWA s.v. váy-, KEWA III.266). The possible combinations of these two ambiguous
elements allow for a number of interpretations. I more or less follow the Sāy/Gr
interpretation, ‘auf beiden Seiten des Wagens gehend’, though I take it as an
adverbial instrumental, not a dual. (The presence of a number of duals in -ā in the
verse does not favor an adverbial interpretation, however.) Re’s “aux ailes d’oiseau”
obviously takes the first member as the ‘bird’ word, while WG “die mit weiten
Flügeln” takes ví as the preverb, but with the second member meaning ‘wing’ as in
Re’s interpretation. Ge’s ‘auseinanderstrebenden(?)’ treats the second member quite
loosely.</p>
<h3 id="i63">I.6.3</h3>
<p>The baffling part of this verse is the voc. plural maryāḥ ‘o young men’ in b,
embedded in a verse that otherwise has 2nd singular reference (ajāyathāḥ c, along
with sg. ptcpl. kṛṇván in a). There is no clear referent for this voc., though it may
refer to the unidentified plural subjects of the verbs in vss. 1-2 (yuñjánti) and 4
(eriré). In the plural márya- is often used of the Maruts, which may account for the
Anukramaṇī identification of them as divinities of the hymn. Though Ge suggests
they may constitute the audience for the singer and Re that they are the singers
themselves, this seems unlikely because when márya- has an identifiable referent, it
is never a human. I tentatively assume that it refers to the Aṅgirases as the firepriests who first kindled Agni, the subject of the verse.
As for the subject of ajāyathāḥ, contrary to most interpretations I take this as
primarily referring to Agni, not the sun, though perhaps, with Re, “Agni solaire.”</p>
<h3 id="i64">I.6.4</h3>
<p>Grammatically problematic is the accent on the verb eriré in b, a fact that
seems to have been elided in most translations, including mine. Old suggests that the
particle áha may have conditioned the accent, but this seems unlikely because áha
doesn’t have this effect elsewhere. I would now alter the translation to make vs. 4
syntactically dependent on vs. 3, without an overt subordinator. Thus, “you were
born together with the dawns, / (as/when) just after that they once again roused …”
Again, though most commentators (save Old) consider this to concern the rebirth of
the sun, I think it more likely that Agni/the ritual fire is the object, esp. as erire +/- ní
is regularly used of establishing the ritual fire (e.g., I.134.4). As for c, the service to
the ritual fire of the unnamed subjects (=Aṅgirases?) would account for their
receiving a name worthy of the sacrifice; see, e.g., I.72.3.</p>
<h3 id="i65">I.6.5</h3>
<p>As noted in the intro., this verse helps resolve the unclear referents in the
earlier part of the hymn by giving a relatively clear sketch of the Vala myth, with
Indra finding the cows after his companions “break the stronghold (=Vala).”</p>
<h3 id="i66">I.6.6</h3>
<p>This verse contains, in my opinion, what Re might call a “legère zeugma,” in
which the verb anūṣata “they bellowed” takes (as is usual) an acc. of the target of the
bellowing (“to the finder of goods,” i.e., Indra) in the frame, but in the simile it takes
an acc. of the content of the bellowing (“their thought”). Ge avoids this mismatch of
8
acc. function by removing matím from the simile by supplying a form of √bhṛ ‘bear,
present’, leaving devayántaḥ as the only term directly compared in the simile: “Wie
Gottverlangende, die das Lied [vortragen], so haben die Lobreden … hergerufen.” It
is certainly true that matí- is common as the object of √bhṛ and that √nu doesn’t
normally take an acc. of content, but since the poet of the hymn has pushed the
linguistic limits elsewhere, I prefer to think he meant the jarring figure. Note that
there is also a mismatch between the two subjects, with the simile referring,
implicitly, to human actors, while the frame has ‘songs’ (gíraḥ) as subject (unless we
take the Aṅgirases or the cows as subj. and allow anūṣata to take two accusatives:
“they bellowed their songs to the finder of goods” – however, √nu doesn’t take two
acc., to my knowledge).
The zeugma may iconically represent the fact that the verse connects across a
temporal gap as well: the simile seems to refer to present-day worshippers producing
their praise, but the frame (with augmented verb form) refers to the mythic past of
the Vala tale. This verse thus serves as a transition to the here-and-now of the current
ritual, which is treated in vs. 7.</p>
<h3 id="i67">I.6.7</h3>
<p>As noted in the intro., this verse pairs structurally with vs. 3; I therefore take
Agni to be the subject, with the verse expressing the kindling of the fire at the time
when Indra arrives to receive the morning offering.
The form dṛ́kṣase is isolated, but its grammatical identity is fairly clear (see
Narten, Sig. Aor. p. 146): a 2nd sg. mid. s-aor. subj. with the “wrong” grade of the
root (expect *darkṣase); it is probably based immediately on the other s-aor. middle
form, 3rd pl. indic. adṛkṣata (5x, once accented) of the same metrical shape (minus
augment), which always appears final, as does dṛ́kṣase, and usually in dimeter verse
as here.
The two beings in pādas ab, one as unexpressed sg. subj. of the verb, one in
the instr., are then referred to as a pair in the du. nom. of pāda c, the predicate of an
unexpressed nominal sentence “you two are…”</p>
<h3 id="i68">I.6.8</h3>
<p>The Aṅgirases are presumably the referents of the instr. phrases, and the verse
is, like 5, a pretty clear allusion to the Vala myth.</p>
<h3 id="i69">I.6.9</h3>
<p>As suggested in the intro., this is the last real verse of the hymn, as vs. 10 is a
mere variant of 9, and it shows a bit of ring composition: the diváḥ … rocanā́t echoes
rocanā́diví of 1c, and if we were to accept Re’s interpr. of 1b tasthúṣaḥ as an
ablative, the ablatives átaḥ and rocanā́t would match it grammatically.
This is a rare example of the present middle ṛñj not taking an acc. (see Tucker
2002: 284 n.17, HS 115 “RV rgmín-, ṛgmíya- and ṛñjate”). (JL)</p>
<h2 id="i7-indra">I.7 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="i71">I.7.1</h3>
<p>anūṣata provides a link to the immediately preceding hymn, I.6.6.
9</p>
<h3 id="i72">I.7.2</h3>
<p>Though a number of interpreters (Gr, WG, Scar) take vacoyújā as an instr. sg.
and supply ráthena ‘chariot’, this form otherwise (4x) is only du. and modifies hárī
‘the two fallow bays’. Thus, it seems better to follow the Sāy/Ge/Re interpr. As Ge
points out, the untethered ā́in b allows a form of √sthā to be supplied, in the idiom ā́
√sthā ‘mount’. The verse is then slightly unusual in referring to Indra’s twin horses
in two grammatical cases in the same sentence (háryoḥ loc., [hárī] vacoyújā acc.).</p>
<h3 id="i73">I.7.3</h3>
<p>A more felicitous tr. of dīrghā́ya cákṣase might be “to be seen for a long time,”
but “for the long view” allows the phrase to be read as referring to either time or
space (“to be seen for a long distance”) or both.
The usage of the instr. góbhiḥ is somewhat strange; it is clearly not meant
either as an instr. of agent/instrument or of accompaniment, at least of simple
accompaniment. It might be an instr. of separation, or, as in this tr., an adjunct or
accompaniment to the obj.: “the rock (which was) with cows.” ET points out to me
that such a construction would be very unusual; I suggest that it could derive from an
instr. of accompaniment: “the rock along with its cows.”</p>
<h3 id="i76">I.7.6</h3>
<p>For the pot, see intro. The doubling of the 1st pl. pronoun (naḥ in a, asmábhyam
in c) is probably simple redundancy, with naḥ a Wackernagel placeholder at the
beginning of the sentence, anticipating the full pronoun that opens c. However the
naḥ could possibly be construed with the voc. sátrādāvan ‘who give in every way’ in
b, though it seems a bit distant from the enclitic.</p>
<h3 id="i77">I.7.7</h3>
<p>Improper relative, as shown best by Re’s rendering, “Les corps-de-louange qui,
poussée, (vont toujours) plus haut…” (Re’s suspension dots). The masc. nom. pl. yé
… stómāḥ of ab has no matching grammatical referent in the main clause of c,
though it is picked up by its semantic and etymological equivalent, fem. sg. suṣṭutí-.</p>
<h3 id="i78">I.7.8</h3>
<p>Connected to vs. 6 by shared vocab., vṛ́ṣan- (a) and (the rather rare)
ápratiṣkuta-, though separated by vs. 7.</p>
<h3 id="i79">I.7.9</h3>
<p>Incomplete sentence, consisting only of rel. cl., completed by main cl. of 10.
The ékaḥ opening this last sentence of the hymn and the kévalaḥ ‘exclusively’ that is
its last word are more insistent counterparts of íd in the opening pādas of vss. 1-2.
Once again Madhuchandas seems to be faintly signalling ring composition.</p>
<h2 id="i8-indra">I.8 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="i82">I.8.2</h3>
<p>Incomplete sentence, with relative hanging off rayím ‘wealth’ in the previous
verse. Two methods of fighting are contrasted: ‘fighting (-hatyā́-) by fist’ (muṣṭi-, my
‘bare-knuckled’) and ‘on horseback’ (árvatā). Although the two terms are
grammatically parallel (instrs. muṣṭi-hatyáyā and árvatā), they are not semantically,
since it’s the first member of the compound, muṣṭi- that corresponds to árvatā, and
‘fighting’ must be supplied with the second term.
10
The verse shows overt signs of late grammatical features: esp. the -ai ending
of the middle subjunctive ruṇádhāmahai (rather than -e), but also the longer -ā-stem
instr. -áyā (rather than -ā́), though of course the latter is fairly well distributed
throughout the RV.</p>
<h3 id="i83">I.8.3</h3>
<p>Concatanation of tvótāsaḥ (pāda a) with the same form in 2c, though the one in
2c requires distraction (tuvo-), but not the one in 3a. Ge/Re take ghanā́as (an
archaic) instr. sg., but nom. pl. ghanā́(ḥ) seems preferable, esp. as Madhuchandas
uses the same word in the sg. as a personal designation in I.4.8 (where it applies to
Indra and which I tr. ‘bane’). So Old. Although designating animate beings (namely
“us”) as “hammers” may seem unusual, it’s not unprecedented, at least in English: cf.
the rock song entitled “Sometimes you’re the hammer and sometimes you’re the nail,”
and (gleaned from Google) a quotation from an American poet unknown to me,
Edwin Markham (1852–1940), “For all your days be prepared, and meet them ever
alike. When you are the anvil, bear – when you are the hammer, strike.”</p>
<h3 id="i86">I.8.6</h3>
<p>The whole verse is a relative clause with accented verb (yá ā́śata), with no
overt antecedent available in either the preceding or the following vs. My solution
follows Old, who suggests that it implicitly hangs off vs. 5: Indra’s power is (for
those) who… This fits the message of the hymn, that men’s success is entirely
dependent on Indra’s aid and intervention, a message that is reinforced by the
interdependence of various vss. already noted (1-2 [main cl., rel. cl.], 2-3 [lexical
concatenation]) and to be described below [7-10].
Though ā́śata lacks expressed obj., ‘him’ (=Indra) should be supplied, on the
basis of passages like I.85.7, VIII.97.9.
In the publ. tr. I follow Gr’s deriv. of samohá- from sám √ūh ‘shove together’,
but I now think that it is better analyzed as sa-mohá- to √muh ‘be confused’ (see
comm. ad IV.17.13) and would slightly modify the tr. here to “in the confusion (of
battle).”</p>
<h3 id="i87">I.8.7</h3>
<p>Yet another untethered rel. cl. In my view, the description of Indra’s physical
capacity serves as the basis for the expressions of Indra’s vast liberality and help in
vss. 8-9, each of which begins with evá hí “for just in the same way.” Therefore the
yáḥ ‘which’ of 7a seems a substitute for yáthā ‘even as’, the usual relative with evá.
Although I do not so translate it, 7-8 could be rendered “even as his cheek … swells
…, even so is his liberality…”
For kukṣí- as ‘cheek’, not ‘belly’, see Jamison 1987 (Gs. Cowgill).</p>
<h3 id="i88">I.8.8</h3>
<p>The image of Indra’s generosity as “a ripe branch” is an unusual one; I do not
know of a parallel. In any case, “ripe branch” must be a condensed expression for
something like a branch laden with ripe fruit. (JL)</p>
<h3 id="i810">I.8.10</h3>
<p>Despite sharing the evā́hí opening with vss. 8-9, this verse is not entirely
parallel with those two, which express the vastness of Indra’s liberality and help.
11
Here it is what we owe Indra, praise and recitation, that are implicitly suggested to be
as vast as what he gives us. A tr. more parallel to the previous two verses would be
“Just the same [that is, just as vast] are those things beloved of him, the praise-song
and recitation to be proclaimed …” However, I favor the published tr., with śáṃsyā
‘to be proclaimed’ as predicate, because it provides a hortatory end to the hymn.</p>

<p>somapárvan- ‘soma-joint’ could refer either to the segments of the stalk of the

interpretation.

<p>In my view gṛṇánta(ḥ) is an instance of the comparatively rare (but more

<h3 id="i910">I.9.10</h3>
<p>As Thieme (Fremdling, pp. 11f.) points out, the verse sets up an implicit
contrast between Indra, who is “at home” (nyòkas-) wherever soma is pressed, and
the stranger – but this opposition also implicitly suggests that, despite being a
stranger or foreigner, any man can offer soma and praise to Indra, who will make
himself at home in those foreign parts. This contrast would be better expressed by
“even the stranger chants…” rather than the published “the stranger himself chants…”
The position and function of ā́(embedded in éd) in b are unclear. The verb
√arc doesn’t take ā́and in any case preverbs don’t usually ended up stranded in the
middle of a pāda (of course the etymological figure bṛhád bṛhaté could have been
fronted around it); a mid-pāda position suggests a role as adposition, but as an
adposition ā́doesn’t take a dative.</p>

<p>The first three pādas almost, but not quite, provide a tripartite ritual speech
division: Sāmaveda, Ṛgveda, X? Veda. The last is the problem: the “formulators”

brāhmaṇa priest to be associated with the Atharvaveda, as in later Vedic.

<p>The case usage here is somewhat odd, in that the three benefits we beg Indra
for, in strict parallel structure, are in loc., dat., and loc. respectively (underlying
forms sakhitvé … rāyé … suvī́rye). However, all end in -e — showing that surface
phonetic agreement can sometimes trump case function.
The transformation of an epithet (śakrá- ‘able’) into its associated verb (śakat
‘he will be able’) is a neat little figure and demonstrates the importance of gods’
dynamically living up to their verbal attributes. (For the almost identical pāda see
VIII.32.12.) It is an example of a type of verbal transformation of divine epithets into
desired divine action that Elizarenkova (1968: 267–68) attempted to claim as the, or
an, organizing principle of RVic hymnic composition., despite its relative rarity. Of
the other standard translations, only Re (“… le puissant; qu’il exerce .. sa puissance”)
captures the etymological figure.</p>
<h3 id="i107">I.10.7</h3>
<p>The two compounds in pāda a, suvivṛ́taṃ sunirájam, do not occur elsewhere
and are grammatically and interpretively ambiguous. The semantic reference of the
two words is clear — the easy opening (ví √vṛ) of the Vala cave and the easy driving
out (nir √aj) of the cows, using the standard lexemes for those actions — but 1) what
are their stems? and 2) assuming they are adjectival, what do they modify? Gr/Lub
analyse them as -a-stems &ndash; also AiG II.1, though AiG II.2 takes sunirájam as
belonging to an a-stem (p. 86) but suvivṛ́tam to a root noun (p. 43) [and Hauschild’s
Index to AiG lists them both as root nouns, somewhat emphatically] &ndash; while, e.g.,
Old and Scar take both as root nouns. There is another formal anomaly: the pāda they
form, suvivṛ́taṃ sunirájam, has only one internal heavy syllable, the final syllable of
the first word, where the initial consonant of the second makes position. A very
unusual metrical line. Arnold (VM 125–26, 290) suggests the possibility of reading
13
suvīvṛ́tam on the basis of the lengthening of the final vowels of the preverbs ápi, abhí,
pári, etc., before forms of √vṛ. Thanks to ET for pointing this out.
As to their reference, the general approach has been to take them as
modifying an unexpressed índram, supplying the whole structure of 6a (tám …
īmahe “we beseech him”) or some similar verb phrase to provide a grammatically
acceptable referent for the two forms in 7a. But this solution is not very satisfying:
Indra appears in the 3rd ps. nominative in 6c and as 2nd ps. vocative and subject of
impv. in 7bcd, so extracting an acc. from a pāda in the past seems arbitrary. Scar
suggests that the two words might instead modify yáśaḥ in b, which has the merit of
providing a referent close by; however, this would technically eliminate the
possibility that the two are root nouns, since yáśaḥ is neut. and presumably nom., and
if the two words in pāda a are root nouns, they can only be acc. sg. I am nonetheless
attracted by this solution (and would therefore be open to the -a-stem interpretation),
with the possible modification that the two might actually be nouns (“the easy
opening …, the easy driving …”) that specify the glory (yáśaḥ) of b. I have not
troubled myself to figure out how the accent and other details of the formation would
work, however.

<p>jéṣaḥ: The standard translation take this s-aor. subj. as a functional impv.
parallel to dhūnuhi in d, whereas I take it as having real subjunctive value. This has
the merit of providing a main clause to the subordinated hí clause of ab. Moreover,
the otherwise identical pāda VIII.40.10 with 3rd sg. subj. jéṣat has clear subjunctive
value, and in addition there is already a well-attested “-si imperative” jéṣi (7x) that
fills that function for the s-aor., so it seems unlikely that jéṣaḥ would be so used.</p>

<p>Though it may seem odd that the enemy Vala is called ‘fearless’, the other
solution, to take ábibhyuṣaḥ as an “irregular” nom. pl. masc. pf. part. (expect
ábibhīvāṃsaḥ) (so Sāy/Old), is not satisfying, esp. as it’s hard for me to see how the
gods could be both “fearless” and “being pushed back” (although ET points out that
they could have come to Indra’s aid without fear, even though being pushed back).
The question is what syntactic function the gen./abl. ábibhyuṣaḥ is fulfilling. Re
seems to take it as a gen. agent with tujyámānāsaḥ (“pressés par le (dieu) sans peur”),
but gen. agents are rare and confined to semantically and grammatically specialized
situations (see Jamison 1979), and an ablative value “before,” as implied by Ge,
seems better. Since expressions of fearing take the ablative, we can even assume an
underlying implicit contrast: “the gods, (fearful) of [=from] the fearless one…”</p>
<h3 id="i116">I.11.6</h3>
<p>Although Ge suggests simply that the poet is announcing Indra’s gifts to the
river of his native land, this may have a further mythological reference. Esp. in
X.108 (Saramā and the Paṇis), the (Vala) cave in which the Paṇis have trapped
Indra’s cows is on the edge of the world, across the river (Rasā) that borders the
world. Here the poet may be evoking this myth to indicate the efforts that he (and
Indra) must expend to retrieve the good things his community desires, and to
emphasize that poets and wise men (see also vs. 7) must bear witness to Indra’s
deeds performed far away in order to attract his munificence.</p>

<p>The plethora of ritual fires implied by the āmreḍita agním-agnim in vs. 2 is
made more explicit in this expression of the kindling of one fire by another,
presumably (as Ge suggests) through the taking out of the Āhavanīya fire from the
Gārhapatya, much treated in the later ritual lit. The Āhavanīya may be referred to in
5a ghṛ́ta-āhavana- ‘whose oblation is ghee’, and in this vs. the second pāda (6b)
might contain allusions to the three ritual fires, gṛhápati- ‘houselord’ a transparent
reference to the Gārhapatya and yúvan- ‘youth’ referring to the newly kindled
Āhavanīya (see pāda a). However, this would leave kaví- ‘poet, sage-poet’ as a
designation of the Dakṣināgni, which doesn’t make a lot of sense, as far as I can see.</p>

<h3 id="i143">I.14.3</h3>
<p>All these gods names are in the accusative, but there is no verb to govern
them, either in the verse or in the immediately preceding or following pādas. One
solution is to reach back to 2a ā́ACC káṇvā ahūṣata “The Kaṇvas have called ACC
here,” though skipping over the intervening syntactic constructions is not appealing.
However, the recurrence of a similar construction in 5ab īḷate ACC … káṇvāsaḥ “The
Kaṇvas solemnly invoke ACC” may suggest that the structure of invocation underlies
the hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i144">I.14.4</h3>
<p>Acdg. to Gr, mádhvaḥ is a nom. pl. masc. adj., modifying drapsā́ḥ. But it is
surely a gen. sg. of the neut. noun: “drops of honey” (so also, e.g., Ge). Note the
identical form in 7c, which has to be a gen. sg., varying with mádhoḥ, also gen. sg.,
in the flg. vs. (8c) in the same metrical position. In fact, no exx. of mádhvaḥ
identified as m. or f. nom. or acc. pl. are secure; they can all be interpr. as the gen. sg.
of the noun. See further disc. ad IX.89.3.</p>
<h3 id="i146">I.14.6</h3>
<p>By making pāda a a nominal sentence, from which the relative clause of bc
hangs, I avoid the need to supply a main clause verb for c that other tr. encounter.
E.g., Ge “Die … Fahrrosse, die dich fahren, (mögen) die Götter … her(fahren).”
However, in the following vs. (7) Agni himself is urged to bring the gods here, so
lumping together the transport of Agni and the gods as in my interpretation of 6 may
not be in the spirit of their separation in 7. Nonetheless, I still feel that the syntactic
argument is strong.</p>
<h3 id="i147">I.14.7</h3>
<p>The ab pādas literally mean “make (the gods) possess wives,” but we know
from the ritual that this refers to the coming of the gods along with their wives. Cf.
III.6.9 pátnīvataḥ … devā́n … ā́vaha. Ge translates our phrase literally: “Die
Opferwürdigen … mache beweibt,” but then paraphrases it in his note: “D. h. bring
ihre Frauen mit.” The problem would be solved by supplying the preverb ā́, because
ā́√kṛ generally means ‘bring/attract here’. Although I am generally loathe to supply
material without a clear warrant, it is the case that the immediately preceding pāda,
6c, begins with ā́, which might have been taken to have domain over what follows.</p>
<h3 id="i149">I.14.9</h3>
<p>The hapax ā́kīm (so, e.g., Gr, Aufr, HvN, Lub) or, more likely, ā́kīm contains
what is apparently a now meaningless particle kīm, matching the shape of the acc.

-stem, it has
lost all interrogative value, presumably “laundered” through the weak negative
indefinites ná kīm (or nákīm) and mā́kīm (or mā́kīm). It is not at all clear what, if
anything, kīm is doing here.
16</p>
<h3 id="i1410">I.14.10</h3>
<p>Instrumental plurals begin (víśvebhiḥ) and end (dhā́mabhiḥ) the verse. The
question is whether they should be construed separately or together. Ge chooses the
latter path: “Mit allen Verkörperungen des Mitra (der Freundschaft).” But because
the hymn is dedicated to the Viśve Devas and there is an emphasis on them
throughout (see esp. vss. 1, 9, with ‘gods’ or words referring to them collectively in
vss. 2, 6, 7, 8), I prefer to supply ‘gods’ with víśvebhiḥ and take dhā́mabhiḥ
separately (sim. Re, WG), interpreting mitrásya not as the god’s name (or not
principally the god’s name) but as referring to the alliance that undergirds the
sacrificial system.</p>
<h3 id="i1412">I.14.12</h3>
<p>The construction involving the normally causal particle hí and the imperative
is a troubling one. Brereton (2012 Bronkhorst Fs.) plausibly argues that in cases like
this, with two imperative clauses in sequence, the hí clause expresses the action
necessary for the second one to take place. In other words, the usual causal value of
hí is found there as well, though the addition of imperative modality makes it
difficult to render in English.
I.15 Sequential deities (for the ṛtugrahas)
Although this hymn is in some ways a rote and formulaic listing of the
Ṛtugraha deities with invitations to drink of their respective cups, the poet does inject
some life in the hymn by varying the expected phraseology. After having established
the formula DRINK ṛtúnā in the first few verses, the poet introduces deviations from
that formula. In vs. 5 he urges Indra to drink not from the Brahman’s cup (as would
be standard: see II.36.5), but from the Brahman’s “largesse” (rā́dhasaḥ) and ṛtū́m̐
ánu substitutes for ṛtúnā (note the phonological crossing of únā: ánu). In vs. 6 there
is no invitation to drink, though ṛtúnā is found in another expression. In vs. 7 the
expected deity (“Wealth-giver”) appears in the nominative (draviṇodā́(ḥ)) as
expected, but there is no attached predicate: the verse goes off in a different direction.
The Wealth-giver is the subject of the next three verses (8-10) as well, but it is only
in vs. 9 that any drinking goes on. Here the imperative “drink!” is replaced by the
desiderative “desires to drink” (pipīṣati), and though there is an ablative of a priestly
cup, it is one belonging to a different priest and the verb used with it is not ‘drink’.
Although this is not high art, it does show that even the most cut-and-dried litany
affords some room to tinker with the verbal form.</p>
<h3 id="i151">I.15.1</h3>
<p>The accent on píba is syntactically unnecessary and not well explained.
Oldenberg (ZDMG 60) suggests either that it&rsquo;s a not explicitly marked foundation
clause for the following clause, or that píba has a tendency to emphatic accentuation.
Although he does not want to get the accent from píbata ṛtúnā in the next verse,
where the accent is correct (following voc. márutaḥ; cf. also píba ṛtúnā in 4c, again
with correct accent), this seems a possibility. One might also note that in the second
Ṛtugraha hymn sequence (II.37.1-3), the verb is accented in the phrase píba ṛtúbhiḥ,
though again the accent is unnecessary. So perhaps píba ṛtúnā/ṛtúbhiḥ was a
17
separable refrain-phrase in the Ṛtugraha ritual, and therefore received accent even
when incorporated into a hymnal context. See now comm. ad III.32.1.</p>
<h3 id="i152">I.15.2</h3>
<p>sudānavaḥ lacks accent and is therefore a vocative, not (as the tr. implies) a
predicative nominative. The predicated vocative has been much discussed in the lit.;
see Old, Noten ad loc. and Bloomfield, RR. On this repeated pāda see comm. ad
VIII.7.12.</p>

<h3 id="i156">I.15.6</h3>
<p>The voc. dhṛtavrata ‘of steadfast commandments’ is apparently a singular in
the Saṃhitā text, though the Pp. reads -ā. There is, however, no sandhi situation that
could have triggered a shortening of the final vowel. Although the epithet is several
times found in the du. modifying Mitra and Varuṇa (VIII.25.2, 8), it is more often in
the singular modifying only Varuṇa (e.g., I.44.14, 141.9), and this may have been the
intent here. The vratá is really Varuṇa’s province, not Mitra’s. However, the matter
is complicated by the fact that the clear dual dvandva voc. mítrāvaruṇa in b also has
a singular ending, rather than expected -ā.. I would attribute this shortening to an
attempt to match the short final of sg. dhṛtavrata, rather than assuming the
shortening affected both words for the same reason. Alternatively, as JL points out to
me, it would be possible to consider the final short vowel of dhṛtavrata an example
of Kuiper’s Law, with loss of final laryngeal in pausa, though this could not account
directly for the following mítrāvaruṇa, which is the real problem.</p>

<p>It’s not clear why Indra’s horses are called sū́racakṣas- ‘having the eye of the
sun’, a word otherwise (3x) used of gods. The awkward doubling of the enclitic tvā
(found in both a and c, as object of the same verb) might suggest that the c pāda was
borrowed from elsewhere. And indeed this hymn gives the impression of being
assembled from ready-made formulae; the proportion of repeated pādas is fairly high
(see Bloomfield, RR), not to mention sub-pāda repetitions. JL suggests, however, that
the repeated tvā might not be the result of careless doubling, but rather the stranded
object of a gapped repetition of vahantu in pāda a.
I.17 Indra and Varuṇa
18</p>
<h3 id="i173">I.17.3</h3>
<p>The other standard translations take tarpayethām as a self-beneficial reflexive
“satisfy yourselves” with anukāmám referring to the gods’ desire (e.g., Ge “freuet
euch nach Herzenslust”; Re “Rassasiez-vous à votre gré”), but this doesn’t make
sense. The whole hymnic context depicts Indra and Varuṇa as givers, not takers, and
it’s not clear to me that gods ever desire wealth, per se. It is much more likely that
the poet is asking the gods to grant us wealth, and that the kā́ma is the mortals’, not
the gods’. For further discussion, with a strikingly parallel usage, see Jamison 1983:
140-41 and esp. n. 73, though I would not now emend the text to ánu kā́mam, as I
suggested there. Curiously, though Ge translates the verb as a reflexive, he goes to
elaborate pains to interpret the whole phrase as urging the gods to give us their
wealth, in other words much the same meaning as I favor.
In b rāyá ā́is ambiguous as to case; it could be either dat. rā́ye or abl./gen.
rā́yas (so Pp.). Ge takes it as a gen., construed with anukāmám, but rā́ya ā́is a fairly
well-established expression (e.g., I.81.7, III.56.6) and the rā́ya seems too distant from
anukāmám to be naturally construed with it. Most other tr. seems to favor the dat.
(see esp. disc. of Old ad loc, also Re.), but I weakly favor an abl. reading “from
(your) wealth.”
A further question is what noun to supply with nédiṣṭham ‘closest’ or what
else to do with it. Ge suggests ‘wealth’ in a note; Re seems to take the word as
adverbial (“de la manière la plus proche,” whatever that means). My supplied
“friendship” is based on two occurrences of ā́pyam (VII.15.1, VIII.73.6) and one of
āpím ‘friend’ with nédiṣṭham. Esp. telling is VIII.73.6 nédiṣṭhaṃ yāmy ā́pyam “I
beseech (you two) for closest friendship,” with the same verb as here.</p>
<h3 id="i174">I.17.4</h3>
<p>A curious construction: √bhū + GEN., which seems to express partitive value:
“become (part of) X” à “partake of,” though the path to partitive meaning is not
straightforward. (Other translators seem to feel less guilt about making this leap than
I do.) Closest to it formulaically is vidyā́ma + GEN, “might we know of X.” Cf.
vidyā́ma sumatīnā́m (I.4.3, X.89.17) “might we know (of) your favors.” The oddity
of the construction is exacerbated by the emphatic pāda-initial repetition (a, b) of
indeclinable yuvā́ku ‘of you two’.</p>
<h3 id="i175">I.17.5</h3>
<p>As noted in the intro., this is the middle verse of the hymn and the only one in
which Indra and Varuṇa are separated, and in my view translations that don’t take
this into account are likely to be on the wrong track. (So, Ge’s “Indra, Varuṇa sind
der preisliche Rat der rühmlichen Tausendschenker,” which puts all nominatives and
all genitives together.) The rhetorical structure of ab, nom. sg. – gen. pl. / nom. sg. –
gen. pl., invites an association of each nom. sg. with its immediately following gen.
pl., producing a contrastive pair of Indra associated with thousand-giving and Varuṇa
with (something) to be proclaimed. I have followed this rhetoric clue and, further,
have tentatively supplied a noun (‘master’) to head the gen. phrase. Alternatively,
krátuḥ of c may be the head (“Indra becomes the krátu of …”), as WG take it (also
Ge).
19
There is the further question of what śaṃsyā̀nām refers to. I have somewhat
reluctantly supplied ‘riches’, since this is a theme of the hymn and śaṃsyà- several
times modifies rayí- and similar words (e.g., VIII.60.11, X.47.2). However, it also
regularly qualifies verbal products like ukthyà- or ukthá-, and given Varuṇa’s nature,
an association with “(solemn words) to be proclaimed” is probably more likely than
with “(riches) to be proclaimed.” I might therefore modify my published translation,
though the desire for wealth is quite strong in this hymn (see vss. 3-4, 6-7).</p>
<h3 id="i178">I.17.8</h3>
<p>The doubled nū́nú ‘now now, just now’ is found only here, though doubling
with an intercalated particle is found (nū́cin nú I.120.2, VI.37.3, VII.22.8). It is
possible that the sequence nū́nú vām is meant to evoke a form of √nu ‘bellow, shout’,
in this verse concerning the poet’s praise of the gods. Various forms of song and so
forth serve as subjects of √nu. Cf. nearby I.6.6, 7.1.</p>
<h3 id="i179">I.17.9</h3>
<p>suṣṭutí- ‘lovely praise’ is not a particularly good obj. of huvé, which ordinarily
takes the addressee, not the content of the call. (See … vām … huvé in vs. 7.) Here
the semantic disharmony may suggest that the lovely praise is personified and urged
to do her part to please Indra and Varuṇa.

<h3 id="i181">I.18.1</h3>
<p>Though somā́nam is assigned to a -man-stem by Debrunner (AiG II.2.760), it
seems preferable to analyze it, with Kuiper (IIJ 15 [1973]: 190–94 [my thanks to ET
for the ref.]), as having the so-called “Hoffmann suffix” (*-Hon- / -Hn-) (Hoffmann
1955 = Aufs. II, 378-83) added to the thematic noun sóma-, of the same type as Aves.
mąϑrān- ‘possessing mąϑras’ to mąϑra-. Our somā́nam is a hapax, so there are no
diagnostic forms; a masc. agent noun in -mán would also have suffixal accent and a
long suffixal vowel (cf. dharmā́nam, -as ‘upholder(s)’). In favor of the Hoffmannsuffix interpretation is the quadrisyllabic scansion, inviting distraction of the -ā-,
which should not occur in a man-stem. The accent might be a problem; Hoffmann is
somewhat cagey about the accent of these forms (not difficult, since most of his
examples are Avestan), but he does suggest (p. 381) that the original accent of the
acc. sg. might fall on the suffix, as here. Kuiper makes no mention of the accent.
Most translators (Ge ‘Lautsingenden(?)’, Re, Schmidt B+I, WG) take
sváraṇam to the ‘sound’ root √svar, though Gr connects it with svàr- ‘sun’
(‘glanzreich’). The metrical distraction to suváraṇam might favor a connection with
the ‘sun’ word, since, as far as I know, the ‘sound’ root is never so distracted. This
hapax is also phonologically reminiscent of svàrṇara- ‘possessing solar glory’,
whose initial cluster is always distracted and which almost always occupies the end
of the pāda, as our word does. At the very least, it is likely that svàraṇa- is a pun.
It is surprising to find Kakṣīvant Auśija, the dazzling poet of I.116-26, in the
context of this rather simple and mundane hymn, for Medhātithi certainly lacks
Kakṣīvant’s skill. The request must then be seen as a species of wishful thinking. I
translate auśijá- literally, as ‘descendant of a fire-priest’, though it is also
20
Kakṣīvant’s patronymic, because I think the word previews the Agni theme of the
second half of this hymn. The publ. tr. follows Ge in assuming a desired
identification of Medhātithi with Kakṣīvant: Ge “Mach … zu einem (zweiten)
Kakṣīvat.” ET points out that there is actually no overt mention of Medhātithi and the
verse could simply mean “make Kakṣīvant a possessor of soma …” But then we still
must explain the presence of Kakṣīvant here.</p>
<h3 id="i183">I.18.3</h3>
<p>The śáṃso áruruṣaḥ … mártyasya “(male)diction of the grudging mortal,”
which is dreaded by the poet, anticipates the desirable nárāśáṃsa- ‘praise of men’
that opens the last verse of the hymn (9).</p>
<h3 id="i186">I.18.6</h3>
<p>ayāsiṣam: I take this form to the root √yā ‘beseech, implore’, not to √yā
‘drive, go’, which does, admittedly, have a well-attested –siṣ-aorist. So also WG,
though other translators (including Schmidt, B+I) render as a verb of motion (Ge
“habe ich … angegangen”). That interpretation isn’t impossible, but ‘beseech’ fits
the context better.</p>
<h3 id="i187">I.18.7</h3>
<p>If the referent of yásmāt is Agni and the two halves of the hymn concern the
verbal and the physical parts of the sacrifice respectively, as I argue in the intro., this
verse makes particular sense: even a skilled poet has to get the oblations right.</p>
<h3 id="i188">I.18.8</h3>
<p>All standard tr. take hótrā as nom. sg. and the subject of the clause. But since
the point of this verse and the last is the labor Agni expends in making the sacrifice
succeed, it seems better to keep him as subj. of gachati, as he was of ṛdhnoti (a) and
kṛṇoti (b). hótrā can then be an instr. sg. of the ā-stem, as commonly. The ritual
model in which Agni goes to the gods with the offering is of course quite widespread
in the RV.</p>
<h3 id="i189">I.18.9</h3>
<p>Note the high proportion of sibilants in this verse.
The meaning of makhá- and its relatives (here represented by the second
cmpd. member -makhas-) is much discussed. I consider it to have both martial and
bountiful senses. I take the original sense to be martial and, despite some difficulties,
believe the often suggested connection with Grk. μάχομαι. The ‘bounteous’ sense
comes, in my opinion, from secondary association with maghá-, etc. In this
compound sádmamakhas- most tr. take the second member in a ‘give, be bounteous’
sense (e.g., Ge “der einen Wohnsitz beschert,” Re “qui confère-généreusement un
siège,” WG “den … mit einem Himmelssitz freigebigen”). However, the martial
sense fits the context well. The image is of the smoke of the ritual fire rising to, and
thus visually ‘besieging’, heaven itself (so Gr). See Old’s disc.; Scar (277)
questioningly suggests both.
I.19 Agni and the Maruts

<h3 id="i194">I.19.4</h3>
<p>Note the double etymological figures arkám ānr̥cúḥ ‘chanted the chant’ and
ugrā́ḥ &hellip; ójasā ‘strong ones … through strength’, with the former nested inside the
latter. There is also phonological play between &hellip;ám ānr-̥ and ánādhr-̥
I.19.7–8: Ge (sim. Re) supplies a verb (“kommen”) with 7b. I am, as usual, reluctant
to do so, but as ET points out, swinging the mountains across the sea is a very
peculiar image. I would prefer to supply the ‘stretch’ (ā́… tánvanti) of the next verse,
since the b pādas of 7–8 are structually identical, producing a tr. of 7ab “Those who
make the mountains swing, (as they stretch) across the undulating sea.” However,
Ge/Re don’t construe the ‘stretch’ verb with 8b either.</p>
<h2 id="i20-ṛbhus">I.20 Ṛbhus</h2>
<h3 id="i201">I.20.1</h3>
<p>Calling the Ṛbhus “the godly breed” (devá- jánman-) is a bold way to begin
this hymn precisely because they did not begin as gods but obtained immortality by
their wondrous deeds — the deeds about to be recounted in the hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i202">I.20.2</h3>
<p>Although vacoyújā is principally a dual acc., modifying the two fallow bays
(hárī) as usual, it could also secondarily be taken as an instr. sg., modifying mánasā
‘with mind’. In any case, ‘speech’ and ‘mind’ are implicitly contrasted in this verse,
and in addition mánasā contrasts with āsayā́‘by mouth’, referring to the means of
creating.</p>
<h3 id="i203">I.20.3</h3>
<p>Though Ge (/WG) takes sabardúgha- as the cow’s name, the word has a

I.21 Indra and Agni
The verbal “hero” of this hymn is the nom.-acc. du. pronoun tā́‘these two’,
which represents the pairing of the otherwise very different gods Indra and Agni.
The form appears 6x in the hymn, with an additional gen.-loc. táyoḥ in 1b.</p>
<h3 id="i216">I.21.6</h3>
<p>The opening of this vs., téna satyéna, is of course the standard signal of the
later truth formulation (satyakriyā). It is difficult to impose such a value here, but the
phrase can be seen as a summary of the praise-hymn that precedes this final vs. and
therefore as the grounds on which the poet asks for their vigilance and help.
Ge (followed by WG) considers the padá- that is to be watched over the track
or traces of something demonic or monstrous (“Die Spur der Unholde”), presumably
the rákṣas- of the previous vs. But Re (XIV.121) points out that the root √gṛ ‘be
watchful, wakeful’ always governs an object with favorable sense. Still, the exact
reference of padá- is unclear. As the word is often used of the ritual ground (e.g., in
the phrase iḷás padé “in the footprint of refreshment” [I.128.1, etc.]), I have
interpreted it in this way in the transl. But it’s also possible to invoke another
22
common use of the word, for the cosmogonic footsteps of Viṣṇu, an example of
which is in the last verse of the next hymn, also close to a form of √gṛ (I.22.21):
jāgrv̥ ā́ṃsaḥ &hellip; víṣṇor yát paramám padám “watchful (over) what is the highest
footstep of Viṣṇu.” These two views can in fact be reconciled. As noted below, the
“highest footstep of Viṣṇu” in that verse is probably a reference to the sun, identified
with the ritual fire, and therefore here “the footprint of discernment” can be both the
ritual ground and Viṣṇu’s footprint in heaven.
I.22 Various divinities</p>
<h3 id="i224">I.22.4</h3>
<p>The use of the diminutivizing -ka-suffix on dūraké ‘at a (little) distance’
reinforces the point of the verse, that it’s not much of a trip for the Aśvins to come
here.</p>
<h3 id="i226">I.22.6</h3>
<p>It is not entirely clear why we “desire the commandments (vratā́ni)” of
Savitar, though I think it is likely that it is because his vratá keep the world
functioning, esp. the cyclical rising and setting of the sun.</p>
<h3 id="i2210">I.22.10</h3>
<p>Note the opening phonetic figure ā́gnā́agna.
The shadowy goddess figures mentioned here are difficult to sort out. I
assume that there are three goddesses here, with Hotrā Bhāratī the double name of
the deified libation belonging to the Bharatas. In this passage Ge takes them as two
different figures (also in II.1.11, III.62.3), but in I.142.9 as a doubly named single
figure. See Old (SBE, ad I.142.9): “Hotrâ Bhâratî, i.e., the personified Offering of
the Bharatas, seems to be one goddess, more usually called simply Bhâratî,” with reff.</p>
<h3 id="i2211">I.22.11</h3>
<p>The goddesses “with unclipped wings” (áchinnapatra-) are found only here
in the RV, but appear in a set of YV mantras used in the Agnicayana at the placing
and heating of the ukhā pot (for firing the bricks). See VS XI.61, MS II.76, KS
XVI.6, ŚB VI.5.4.8, etc. A number of other female divinities are mentioned in the
same context. What áchinnapatra- actually refers to is unclear to me. Griffith (ad VS
XI.61) suggests “moving freely and without interruption.” It mightb evoke the myth
of the originally winged mountains, whose wings Indra clipped so that they would
settle down. But the mountains are masculine fitures. I also do not see any sign of the
later Agnicayana employment here, simply an association with other female divine
figures.</p>
<h3 id="i2213">I.22.13</h3>
<p>mahī́is grammatically ambiguous, as it can be either fem. singular or fem.
(or neut.) dual. Most tr. take it as the former, modifying only dyaúḥ, but all things
being equal, it is preferable to take dyaúḥ as masculine (though fem. occasionally is
unavoidable), esp. as mahī́by itself can refer to the earth without further
specification. I see no reason why mahī́cannot be dual here, modifying the conjoined
NP dyaúḥ pṛthivī́ca.
23</p>
<h3 id="i2214">I.22.14</h3>
<p>The meaning of this verse is entirely obscure to me, and it comes as a
surprise in a hymn (or set of hymns) displaying no other verbal tricks at all. (It is true
that the Gandharva spreads obscurity almost every place he appears in the RV.) I
might speculate that what the verse is conveying is that by their inspired hymns the
poets have achieved a place in the highest firmament, where the Gandharva often
seems to be located, and where they consume the luscious food produced by Heaven
and Earth. If this speculation has any merit, the instr. dhītíbhiḥ should not be taken as
an instrument of licking (“lick … with their poetic insights”), but rather as an instr.
of cause (“by reason of their [prior and successful] poetic insights”), so the publ. tr.
could be amended accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="i2215">I.22.15</h3>
<p>On anṛkṣará- as ‘not sweeping men away’, rather than ‘thornless’, see
Jamison 1993 (Fs. Rix). The standard ‘thornless’ interpretation has no real support; I
derive the word instead from a-nṛ-kṣara-, to the root √kṣar ‘flow, stream’, cognate
with Greek φϑείρω ‘I destroy’. Formulaic and textual support for this analysis is
given in the art. cit.
“A place to settle down” (nivéśanī) might have been better tr. adjectivally
“bring to rest, causing to settle down,” but this causes awkwardness in the English.
I.22.16-18: This tṛca is marked by minor ring composition: the átaḥ [sandhi áto]
‘from there’ that begins 16a also begins the last pāda of 18, in the same sandhi form.</p>
<h3 id="i2220">I.22.20</h3>
<p>The image in pāda c needs a little unpacking. The “eye in heaven” is of
course the sun; the incongruity is that it is depicted as “stretched out,” which might
suggest an elongated ovoid sun, not a happy picture. The concentrated expression of
pāda c rests on the common formula of the sun stretching (through space) with its
rays (raśmí-), as in VII.47.4 yā́ḥ sū́ryo raśmíbhir ātatā́na “towards which [=waters]
the sun has stretched with its rays.” Note that sūráyaḥ ‘patrons’ ending b
phonologically evokes the absent sū́r
i
ya- in c.</p>
<h3 id="i2221">I.22.21</h3>
<p>This verse also contains some semantic incongruities: “kindling the footstep”
is of course a curious expression, and that poets, presumably human, perform this
action on the “highest footstep of Viṣṇu,” usually an expression for highest heaven,
makes it all the odder. Ge (also Old, WG) plausibly identify “the highest footstep of
Viṣṇu” here as the sun, and the verse would therefore express the common notion
that priests kindling the ritual fire at dawn cause the sun to shine.
I.23 Various gods (Praügaśastra)
I.23.4-6: This tṛca to Mitra and Varuṇa stations the two names in three different ways
in the three verses. In 4 mitrá- opens the first pāda and váruṇa- the second; in 5 they
are expressed in the dual dvandva mitrā́váruṇā in c; in 6 they again open the first two
pādas, but with váruṇa- first and mitrá- second.
24</p>
<h3 id="i238">I.23.8</h3>
<p>It is striking that all of ab is made up of vocatives, with each one accented:
because of the place of the accent, three of the four words have to be vocatives; only
índrajyeṣṭhā(h) could be nom. pl., since índra- has inherent initial accent. The first
word of c, víśve, may also be and probably is a voc., making a pair with voc. dévāsaḥ,
which opens the preceding pāda. On the voc. of víśva- see comm. ad X.15.6.
It would be satisfying to have three GOD-X bahuvrīhis parallel in semantic and
morphological structure, but although Ge (followed by WG) interprets the rāti- in
pū́ṣa-rātayaḥ as an agent noun (“mit Pūṣan als Gönner”), rātí- both as simplex and in
its fairly numerous compounds is always an abstract ‘giving’ or concretized version
thereof (‘gift’), as its morphology as a deverbal feminine abstract would require. I
therefore take the third cmpd as a tatpuruṣa pūṣa-rātí- the gift(s)/giving of Pūṣan’. It
owes its initial accent to the fact that it is a voc. (as does the bahuvrīhi márudgaṇāḥ
[expect *marúdgaṇa-].) The ‘gift’ or ‘giving’ of Pūṣan is described as auspicious
(bhadrā́) in VI.58.1.</p>
<h3 id="i239">I.23.9</h3>
<p>Ge (WG), following Gr, tr. sáhasā as an adj. modifying Indra (“mit dem
starken Indra”), but this is of course impossible. With that accent it must be a neut.;
accent shift to *sahás- would turn it into an adjective, but this form is unattested
(versus, e.g., yáśas- ‘glory’à yaśás- ‘glorious’).
On the analysis of fairly common 3rd sg. īśata (always with mā́(kiḥ)) as an
injunc. to a reduplicated aor., see Hoffmann 1967 (Injunk.): 64-66 (seemingly
accepted by Lub, Concordance). Although he adduces semantic and syntactic factors
that impose this interpretation, it nonetheless does not seem entirely satisfying,
because the thematic stem envisioned (īśa- [never accented]) seems insufficiently
distinguished from the presential perfect stem ī́ś-, and Hoffmann does not suggest a
mechanism for deriving such an aorist stem from either the presential perfect stem or
directly from the root. Moreover, his argument that mā́preventive clauses should
have an aorist might falter in the face of a root that simply lacks an aorist. (See now
IH’s work demonstrating just that.) I prefer Debrunner’s explanation, rejected by
Hoffmann, that īśata represents a re-marking of īśa with -ta to make it more clearly a
3rd sg. Judging from the accent (ī́śe, ī́śāna- [versus īśāná-]), the old presential perfect
had been mostly reanalyzed as a root present, and īśa would be an anomalous 3rd sg.
injunctive to such a present.
I.23.13-15: As noted in the intro., I take the “king” that Pūṣan is returning as Agni,
not, with most tr., Soma. The theme of the finding and returning of the god-in-hiding
in 14 is much more appropriate for Agni than for Soma, and the “glitttering barhis”
is also more likely to be associated with Agni. Both Agni and Soma are called
“buttress, support” (13) (Agni in V.15.1–2) and both are called king (14). The drops
(índu-) in 15 might seem rather to indicate Soma, but in VI.16.16 Agni is
strengthened by drops (índubhiḥ), which must be drops of ghee.</p>
<h3 id="i2315">I.23.15</h3>
<p>The ritual referent of the “six yoked” entities (ṣáḍ yuktā́n) is unclear, no
matter whether Soma or Agni is taken as the main referent: those in the Soma camp
25
consider the yoked ones to be the dakṣiṇās due the poet; I consider them the flames
of the recovered Agni, roused by the drops of ghee. In terms of the simile in c, the
six yoked ones are clearly the teams for plowing. See esp. AV VI.91.1, cited by
Schaefer (1994: 197). On anu √sidh as ‘entlangtreiben’, see Schaefer 1994: 196–97.
In my translation I have reversed the renderings of the finite intensive
(unaccented carkṛśat in c) and the intensive participle (accented anuséṣidhat) to
make the relationship between simile and frame clearer.</p>
<h3 id="i2316">I.23.16</h3>
<p>Contra Ge and others but with Re, I construe the gen. pl. adhvarīyatā́m ‘of
those performing the rites’ with ádhvabhiḥ ‘along the roads’, as I do not think the
waters are the mothers of the priests (Ge “Die Mütter der diensttuenden (Priester)”).</p>
<h3 id="i2318">I.23.18</h3>
<p>Ge and others attach b to a, with c a separate sentence, which is also possible.</p>
<h3 id="i2319">I.23.19</h3>
<p>Again I disagree with most tr. in the disposition of the b pāda. I take it with a,
because I think we mortals are to glorify the waters. Others think the gods should
become strong or victorious in order to praise the waters – but gods are not usually
the agents of such praising.
I.23.20-23 = X.9.6-9, save that the fourth pāda of 20 is missing in X.9.6.</p>
<h3 id="i2320">I.23.20</h3>
<p>The semi-direct speech and esp. the casual conversational tone of this verse
are quite unusual for the RV. Although most tr. take the whole as indirect speech
(“Soma said to me that…”), the construction of the verse seems to me to mix direct
and indirect speech, with c, couched in the acc., shading into indirect speech. I take
the final pāda separately, as it is absent from the parallel in X.9.6.
Note the distraction of the apsú antár phrase that opens 19a into two pāda
opening words: 20a #apsú … b #antár.</p>
<h3 id="i2322">I.23.22</h3>
<p>The construction of the 2nd hemistich is complex, containing a double vā
conjoining two yád clauses and an utá, which reaches back to conjoin the indefinite
yát kím ca duritám mama “whatever trouble is in me” (b) and the final word of the vs.
ánṛtam (d). The two yád clauses of cd are alternative expansions of the indefinite
expression of b, while ánṛtam is a new term. So Ge, WG, and, with explicit disc. of
the construction, Klein (DGRV I.301). By contrast Lü (417; sim. Ober II.37) takes
ánṛtam as part of the 2nd yád vā clause and seems to ignore the utá: “… was immer
Sunde an mir ist, was ich betrogen habe oder was ich geschworen habe als Lüge</p>
<h3 id="i2323">I.23.23</h3>
<p>Most tr. take ā́paḥ as acc. here (“I have followed the waters.”). This is of
course possible: the nom. of this stem does get used for acc. occasionally in the RV.
However, such an interpr. is not nec. in this case, since it is easy to supply an acc.
“you.” And the fact that the two previous vss. (21a and 22a) contain vocatives ā́paḥ
and āpaḥ respectively supports a vocative interpretation here.
26</p>
<h3 id="i2324">I.23.24</h3>
<p>It is difficult to know what, if anything, is the referent of asya. I have
tentatively supplied ‘hymn’, but the poet may simply be calling upon the gods to
witness the general situation (so Ge). The same expression √VID me asya is found in
the refrain of I.105, except with accented asyá, for which reason I more confidently
supply ‘speech’ there.

<p>As often, the hí in the first of two imperative clauses marks the action urged

<h3 id="i262">I.26.2</h3>
<p>As on some other occasions the pāda-final vácaḥ, superficially a nom.-acc. (or
a stem form), is to be construed as an instr. with the instr. adj. (divítmatā in this case),
whatever the source of this truncated form. (See M. Hale [Fs. Melchert] for an
attempt, unsuccessful in my view, to see it as an archaic zero-grade s-stem instr. [*-
es-H, not the renewed and standard *-es-eH]. For further disc. see comm. ad
VIII.39.2.) In this particular phrase, the existence of a fully instr. parallel in X.76.6
vā́cā divítā divítmatā strongly suggests that vácaḥ should indeed be construed with
divítmatā here. On divítmant- itself, see comm. ad IV.31.11.</p>

<p>In the phrase … asyá naḥ, mándasva sakhyásya ca most tr. render the ca as
‘also’ and construe the demonstrative with the noun (Ge “… freue dich auch dieser
Freundschaft mit uns”). However, the most natural way to take the syntax is as a
conjoined NP: “of this (x) and the comradeship of ours.” The question is what asyá is
modifying. Following Gr I supply ‘ritual grass’, because barhíḥ is the most recent
ritual referent (4a). Although “rejoicing in ritual grass” may seem an odd activity, cf.
VIII.13.4=VIII.15.5 mandānó asyá barhíṣo ví rājasi, with the same verb √mand
‘rejoice’ and the fuller version of the nominal phrase. (As it happens, in that passage
I construe the barhis phrase with the main verb ví rājasi, but it is certainly
ambiguous.)</p>
<h3 id="i268">I.26.8</h3>
<p>Although most tr. implicitly take pāda a as subordinated to b (e.g., Ge. “Denn
wenn …, so…”), again the ca suggests rather that they are coordinate structures, with
pāda a a nominal sentence (svagnáyaḥ predicated of devā́saḥ) coordinated with the
finite verb dadhiré in b. This verb is accented because it is under the domain of hí in
a. In this reading, pāda c functions as the main cl. of ab.
27
I also supply ‘him’ (=Agni) as first object of dadhiré, again unlike most tr.
(eg., Ge “so bringen sie auch uns Erwünschtes”). For the reasons for this in the
structure of the hymn, see disc. in intro.</p>
<h2 id="i27-agni">I.27 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="i271">I.27.1</h3>
<p>vandádhyai is a predicated infinitive, serving as the main verb.
Pāda a contains a likely et, the possessive -vant-stem adj. vā́ravantam
modifying Agni. In the first instance it means ‘having (that is, providing) choice
things’ (vā́ra-, to √vṛ ‘choose’), but the homonym vā́ra- means ‘hair, tail-hair’ (cf.,
e.g., nearby I.32.12) and so the -vant-stem can mean ‘possessing (long) tail-hair’.
Either of these meanings is applicable to the horse of the simile, which has tail-hair
by nature and brings choice things by winning races and contests. ‘Bringing choice
things’ is more applicable to Agni than ‘having hair’, but his flames could be so
conceived. Note that Agni is characterized as “ghee-haired” (ghṛtá-keśa-) in
VIII.60.2.</p>
<h3 id="i272">I.27.2</h3>
<p>With Old I supply śávasaḥ with sūnúḥ, to complete the common epithet of
Agni “son of strength,” which is suggested by the associated instr. śávasā. Indirect
support might come from the parallel voc. sahaso yaho ‘o young (son) of strength’
(with a different word for strength, also regularly appearing as an epithet of Agni)
that ends the preceding hymn (I.26.10c). However, this supplement is not strictly
necessary, and most tr. do not supply it (e.g., Ge simply “unser Sohn”). In favor of a
translation like Ge’s is the presence of naḥ in pāda a. However, this could simply be
a Wackernagel place-holder for asmā́kam in c. Although the difference might seem
slight, in fact the two interpretations are quite different. Ge’s emphasizes that we
have created Agni, supplying ‘our’ with śávasā (“unser Sohn durch (unsere) Kraft”);
this might suggest that Agni is in our debt because we begot him and he ought
therefore to become our benefactor. The other tr. invest Agni with his own strength
and hopes that he will graciously use some of it to benefit us.</p>
<h3 id="i276">I.27.6</h3>
<p>With Ge (/WG) and Re I take the expression in pāda b as a simile or
comparison that provides the basis for the verb ‘stream’ (kṣarasi) in c. Agni/the fire
cannot literally be on or in a river’s wave.</p>
<h3 id="i277">I.27.7</h3>
<p>It is difficult not to interpret the agent noun yantā́in c as a periphrastic future,
given the subjunctives in ab, pace Tichy 1995: 226. Although it is sometimes
claimed that no examples (or “no certain examples”) of this usage are found in the
Saṃhitās (see esp. Macdonell VGS §152), there are too many passages in the RV
where a future interpretation of the -tar-stem is more natural and fits the context
better than a purely agentive one.</p>
<h3 id="i278">I.27.8</h3>
<p>Since this verse continues the thought of 7, the agent noun paryetā́in b should
likewise be future in value, despite Ge’s “Keiner überholt ihn.”
28
asya … káyasya cit: most tr. take these two genitives as coreferential, with the
indefinite referring to a person – so Ge’s “Keiner überholt ihn, wer er auch sei.” But
the person in question has already been defined as a client of Agni’s, and so an
indefinite seems odd in context. Moreover, the other two instances of paryetár- both
take inanimate complements; cf. VII.40.3 ná tásya rāyáḥ paryetā́sti &ldquo;There exists no
one who can encompass his wealth.&rdquo; Therefore I take káyasya cit as referring to
anything belonging to the favored man, expressed by asya. Ge’s note seems to lean
in this direction, but not his tr.

<p>The supposed voc. járābodha in a is problematic on several grounds. It is
generally taken to mean something like “attentive to the early call,” but 1) the first
member, jarā́-, is only attested in the meaning ‘old age’ (hence Old’s suggested “im
(bis zum) Greisenalter wachend”), and 2) the second member, the thematic nominal
bodhá-, is not otherwise found in the RV (though it does occur in the AV). I
therefore prefer to interpret it as a pair of linked imperatives, járā bodha. The latter
is found 5x in the RV, as impv. to the thematized aor. to √budh ‘awake’; the former
would belong to the thematic pres. jára- of √gṛ/jṛ ‘sing’. Although this present is
ordinarily only middle (vs. járati ‘make old’), attraction in voice would not be
surprising in a construction like this. The long -ā of járā simply reflects the common
lengthening of the 2nd sg. impv. Although we might expect bodha to be accented, it
may have lost the accent when the construction ceased to be understood, or it may
never have received it in this close semantic nexus. Under this analysis the order of
imperatives is actually “sing (and) awake!” which I have reordered for clarity.
Alternatively, we might take járā to √gṛ/jṛ ‘awake’, which likewise builds a Class I
middle pres., and translate “awake (and) take heed.” See Gotō 1987: 150-56 for
discrimination of the various Class I jára- presents.
Since dṛ́śīka- is otherwise a neut. substantive, I have rendered it as
appositional to stómam rather than as an adjective (e.g., Ge “ein schönes Lied”). So
also Re (“un corps-de-louange, chose belle à voir”). Note also the synesthesia, with
the praise-song something to be seen, not heard. This usage somewhat anticipates the
later Vedic notion that ṛṣis “see” divinely bestowed sāmans.
I.28 Indra (Abbreviated Soma Rite)
See intro. for detailed discussion of my interpretation of the context of the
hymn, which differs significantly from the standard view. I discuss this further in a
treatment of the prehistory of the śrauta/gṛhya ritual split: “Vedic Ritual: The
Sacralization of the Mundane and the Domestication of the Sacred” (Thite Fs., 2019,
ed. Lauren Bausch).</p>
<h3 id="i281">I.28.1</h3>
<p>Both pṛthúbudhna- ‘having a broad bottom’ and ūrdhvá- appear to be doubleentendres. The salacious references continue, more clearly, in vss. 3-4.
29</p>
<h3 id="i284">I.28.4</h3>
<p>The word mánthā- occurs only here in the RV; it clearly refers to the churning
stick later known as mantha or cāt(t)ra-, which is bound around with cords that,
manipulated by a priest, move it rapidly back and forth while its bottom tip is
inserted in the hole (yoni) of the lower kindling stick (aráṇi-) to create the friction
that produces fire. The cords here are obviously likened to reins. For equine imagery
in this context and for further disc. of the process, see comm. ad X.27.14.
Here there is a bit of slippage between frame and simile (as Ge also notes, n.
4a): though acc., the reins (raśmī́n) should not be directly compared to the churning
stick, also acc. (manthā́m), and we might rather expect instr. *raśmíbhiḥ. However,
it’s quite possible that raśmī́n is actually dependent on yámitavaí and is not directly
parallel to manthā́m. So perhaps “when they bind the churning stick, as if to control
the reins” (vel sim.); for other passages in which raśmī́n is obj. of √yam see I.144.11,
VIII.35.21.
What is somewhat puzzling is what the reference to the churning stick is
doing in this hymn focused on the preparation of soma, since the implement and the
process are characteristic of the production of the ritual fire. Either kindling the ritual
fire is considered part of the soma preparation here, or, more likely, the pestle used
to pound the soma stalks has been homologized to the churning stick, in great part
because of the highly sexualized nature of that implement in the fire-kindling ritual
(see comm. ad X.27.14).
The inf. yámitavaí here is one of the few not appearing in the configuration -
tavā́u, on which see Klein, Particle u, 164–67. Inter alia, the substitution of iva for
*u gives the desired iambic cadence.</p>
<h3 id="i286">I.28.6</h3>
<p>The reference in this verse is not entirely clear, but “the lord of the wood”
(vánaspáti-, ordinarily a word for tree, or an esp. prominent tree, then applied the
sacrificial post) is probably here the pestle and metaphorically the erect penis. If so,
ágram might be better tr. ‘tip’ than ‘top’ and the whole clause as “the wind blows
across [rather than ‘through’] your tip.” In an unpublished paper on this hymn,
&ldquo;Rgveda I.28 and the Two Forms of Pressing Soma,&rdquo; Hanns-Peter Schmidt cites a
Kuntāpa verse AV 20.136.6 = ŚŚS 12.24.2.7, which he tr. &ldquo;The harlot, stepping over
the mortar, said, &lsquo;Just as on thee, o tree (o wooden mortar), they strike (with the
pestle) so may they strike on me,'&rdquo; which also shows the connection of mortar and
pestle with unlicensed sex. If the tr. is correct, the “lord of the wood” there is the
mortar, not the pestle, as it seems to be here. In vs. 8 below, both the mortar and the
pestle seem to be so called.</p>

<p>Ge takes … táva daṃsánā as a nominal sentence “du hast ja die

<h3 id="i301">I.30.1</h3>
<p>The word krívi- makes trouble wherever it shows up. In some of its
occurrences it appears to be a personal name, but that is unlikely here. It is not even
clear if all the occurrences of krívi-, even in non-personal uses, belong to a single
stem &ndash; in fact it seems unlikely (see comm. ad V.44.4). Here the context favors an
equine reference, and I have taken it as designating a particular color of horse, viz.,
‘blood-red’. Assuming, with most scholars, that krívi- in at least some of its usages is
connected with krívis- in the hapax adj. krívir-dant- (I.166.6), which possibly means
‘having gory teeth’, and that both are etymologically connected with kravís- ‘raw,
bloody flesh’, as a color term ‘blood-red’ would work well. The details of the
derivational relation I leave to others, but a putative -i-stem to the underlying root
krū &lt; *kruh2 (in krūrá- [AV+]) would have the shape *kruh2-i- &gt; *kruv-i-, and
assimilation to krívi- would not be difficult.
The verse is structured by number disharmony — the pres. part. vājayántaḥ is
nom. plural, but the finite verb siñce is singular — reflecting the common conceptual
fluctuation between the collectivity of priests and singers and the priest-poet
speaking in his individual voice.</p>
<h3 id="i302">I.30.2</h3>
<p>The number disharmony continues here, at least in my view. Ge. takes the sg.
rel. pron. yáḥ as referring to Indra and then supplies the verb ‘drinks’ to governing
the ‘hundred’ and ‘thousand’ phrases referring to soma. But if yáḥ is instead taken as
referring to soma and coreferential with the (unexpressed) subj. of the verb in the
main clause rīyate, no material needs to be supplied. Instead the singular ‘which
(soma)’ is defined as consisting of a hundred or a thousand separate drinks. So also
Re.</p>
<h3 id="i303">I.30.3</h3>
<p>The form śuṣmíṇa (in sandhi) can represent either śuṣmíne (dat. sg.) or
śuṣmíṇaḥ (in turn, either gen.-abl. sg. or nom.-acc. pl.). (The Pp. reads -e.) Any of
these possibilities is possible in context, and so it may well be that the ambiguity is
meant. As a nom. pl. it could characterize the subj. (‘they’ = soma drinks), as Re.
takes it. As a gen. sg. it could refer to Indra, who is indeed regularly modified by this
adj. As a dat. sg. it could modify mádāya (so Ge), or it might still refer to Indra, in
well-known double dative construction of the type “for the tempestuous one for his
exhilaration” à “to exhilarate the tempestuous one.” I favor an interpretation that
attributes the word to Indra; among other things, this makes the unaccented asya in b
easier to account for. Preferably genitive śuṣmíṇaḥ, though I have not been able to
find a parallel expression.
On the surface, pāda a lacks a main verb, but it is possible that it is lurking
there. The subordinator yád appears as yán in sandhi before a nasal. The otherwise
unattested 3rd pl. injunctive of √i ‘go’ would have the same shape and is the expected
31
verb in this idiom (cf., e.g., 3rd pl. impf. sám āyan X.27.8). I therefore suggest we
have a notional haplology sáṃ *yád yán.
I do not understand the function of hí in b, which triggers accentuation of the
main verb dadhé in c. I would at all costs prefer to avoid attributing pure emphatic
function to hí, but this passage comes perilously close to that.</p>
<h3 id="i304">I.30.4</h3>
<p>ohase is generally taken as a 2nd sg. mid. to the root √ūh / oh, which has a
messy set of forms. Cf., e.g., Ge. “Diese Rede von uns weisst du gewiss zu würdigen.”
However, I interpret it as a 1st ps. -se form of the type stuṣé ‘I shall praise’, gṛṇīṣé ‘I
shall sing’, all of which fall into this semantic sphere. Indeed the root has a -se
formation of different shape in VIII.5.3 vā́cam … ohiṣe, with almost identical object
(our passage: vácaḥ). For the thematic/(pseudo-)subjunctive form here, cf. arcase ‘I
shall address” (X.64.3). Despite the complications involved in positing a second 1st
ps. -se form to this root and separating ohase from the identical form in VIII.80.9,
which I take as a 2nd sg. in passive usage, I prefer my interpretation to that of Ge
(/WG) ‘value’, Re ‘take into consideration, take note of’, because these latter
seriously attenuate or alter the meaning of the root, which otherwise means
‘solemnly proclaim, praise, vaunt oneself’.</p>
<h3 id="i305">I.30.5</h3>
<p>The word order of ab is rather tortured. The clause is simply a nominal
sentence forming a relative clause, but the relative pronoun phrase yásya te, instead
of appearing in 2nd or modified position after pāda-initial stotrám as is
overwhelmingly common (see, e.g., modified 2nd in 2a śatáṃ vā yáḥ … above),
comes at the very end of the hemistich, separated from its noun by three vocative
phrases, which take up the rest of pāda a and most of pāda b: … rādhānām pate,
gírvāho vīra &hellip;. This still counts as 2nd position since the vocc. are extra-syntactic, but
the poet is cheekily pushing the limits. The te is simply there to indicate that the rel.
pron. has 2nd ps. reference, which is of course not syntactically coded onto the
relative. Cf. the common phrase táṃ tvā (e.g., 10a below), where the 2nd ps. pronoun
has the same function: to give 2nd ps. ref. to the demonstrative.</p>
<h3 id="i308">I.30.8</h3>
<p>yádi here stands for yád *ī, ‘when … it’ rather than ‘if’. The pronominal
enclitic ī has been shortened before the initial cluster of śrávat. See Jamison 2002.</p>
<h3 id="i309">I.30.9</h3>
<p>Although huvé in c is morphologically problematic, its interpretation is
imposed by context: a past-tense 3rd ps. ‘he called’. But this is the only 3rd ps. huvé
(in contrast to over 70 exx. of 1st ps. huvé, -e), and it must be preterital not present, as
huvé otherwise is. I have no explanation.
The referent of te ‘your’ in the same pāda is unclear. Assuming the relevant
constituent is “your father’ (te … pitā́), te should refer to the poet, or some poet, in
whose lineage “you” are, but I would expect the poet to be the 1st ps. speaker of the
first huvé (pāda b). Perhaps the reference to the “ancient house” in pāda a indicates
that another, more venerable poet is on the scene, whose model (and that of his
forebears) the current poet is following. The publ. tr. of pāda a supplies “your” with
32
“ancient house” – implying that the current poet is modeling himself on “you” and
“your father,” but it should be remembered that the “your” of a is not explicit in the
text. It could well be “my ancient house” (or indeed someone else’s). Though the
pāda is repeated in VIII.69.18, that passage is not helpful in interpreting this one.
However, I.87.5 contains an occurrence of pratná- modifying father that seems to
assert a similar entitlement to poetic speech by lineage: I.87.5 pitúḥ pratnásya
jánmanā vadāmasi “We speak by virtue of our kinship with our primordial father.”</p>
<h3 id="i3011">I.30.11</h3>
<p>Though it modifies asmā́kam ‘of us’ and “we” are definitely male,
śipriṇīnām ‘of the (well-)lipped ones’ is a feminine gen. pl. The form must be
contextually motivated: the other two pādas end with (masc.) gen. pls. in -Vnām / -
Vnaam (somapā́vanām [my preference, for HvN somapā́vnãm], sákhīnãm). Esp. the
latter, with -īnãm, invites a type of dittography: *śipriṇãm à śipriṇīnãm. Although
this form reminds us of the equally unexpected fem. for masc. návyasīnãm V.53.10,
58.1, I explain the latter differently. See comm. ad V.53.10.</p>
<h3 id="i3012">I.30.12</h3>
<p>Ge (WG) take iṣṭáye as “dass du rasch kommst,” without comment, but it is
not clear to me what root they are using to produce ‘come quick’. There are several
roots √iṣ to which iṣṭáye could belong: ‘seek, desire’ and ‘send’ are the most likely,
along with the marginal root ‘prosper’ found in iṣáyati. A zero-grade of √yaj
‘sacrifice’ could (and does) also produce iṣṭí-. None of these comes close to ‘come
quick’; my conjecture is that they are connecting it with ‘send’, but forms of this root
are always transitive. Re more reasonably assigns it to the ‘seek’ root: “… que (tu)
cherches (des biens pour nous),” but must supply much material for it to work. I
suggest that it belongs to this same root, but in the sense ‘desire, want’, and that the
message here is the mutually reinforcing “we want you to want what we want.” This
expression is somewhat reminiscent of sá naḥ sanitā́sanáye in vs. 16: “he the winner,
for us to win it,” though using two different but synonymous roots, rather than the
etymological figure of 16.</p>
<h3 id="i3013">I.30.13</h3>
<p>A noun needs to be supplied with revátīḥ ‘rich (fem.)’. Old suggests íṣaḥ
‘refreshments’, which works formulaically with the rest of the lexicon in the passage
(including the verb in c; cf., e.g., VII.64.3 iṣā́madema, with an instr. as in our yā́bhir
madema). Ge’s “Geschenke” (gifts) is not so happy.
sadhamā́da out of sandhi could end in either -e (so Pp., followed by most) or -
aḥ. Complicating the decision is the fact that both a thematic stem sadhamā́da- and a
root noun sadhamā́d- are well attested. Though most tr. take presumed underlying
sadhamā́de as loc. to the thematic stem (Ge “bei dem Mahlgenossen”), I think it
possible that it is the dat. of purpose to the root noun. It may be that Re’s “pour le
symposion” also assumes such a dative.</p>
<h3 id="i3014">I.30.14</h3>
<p>Vss. 14–15 are parallel in structure and phraseology, but this does not help
as much as we might like. To begin at the beginning, it seems odd to refer to Indra as
“one like you” (tvā́vān), and grammatically it is also problematic, because tvā́vant-
33
ordinarily takes a 3rd ps. verb, not 2nd ps. as here. It is tempting to follow Ge’s path
and make ab into a subordinate clause (“Wenn einer wie du…”), but this doesn’t
work because the initial ā́of pāda a must be construed with the ṛṇóḥ of c. The rest of
the first hemistich, two participial phrases, is somewhat awkwardly phrased (at least
in translation) but comprehensible: the praisers obtain Indra (or his like) in his own
person and implore him for aid, which he provides in c. That pāda uses an idiomatic
expression for fitting an axle between two wheels. As the presence of ná in 14c and
the structure of vs. 15 show, this expression is a simile, to which some other action of
Indra is being compared, even though in 14 there is no obvious frame. The meaning
of ā́ṛṇóḥ in the frame is somewhat different from the idiomatic usage, but not, to my
mind, the “untranslatable wordplay” that Ge sees. I take it mean ‘fit out’, namely
‘provide’. In 14c I supply ‘refreshments’ from the preceding vs. (13), the first vs. of
the tṛca. Nonetheless, this translation of the tṛca, esp. 14–15, strikes me as less than
satisfactory.</p>
<h3 id="i3017">I.30.17</h3>
<p>śávīra-. Although this may just have a suffix –īra-, it is tempting to see it as
a bahuvrīhi containing a Caland form śavi- (root śū; cf. śū́ra-) plus írā- ‘refreshment’,
so ‘possessing powerful refreshment’. For the accent, see the many compounds with
śuci-, e.g., śúci-jihva- ‘having a blazing tongue’. If this is correct, the translation of
the same word in I.3.2 should be modified. There it modifies dhī́- ‘insight’, which
might not be as apt, but thoughts and hymns that provide refreshment are not foreign
to the RVic conceptual universe. Although we might expect *śuvi-, ET suggests
comparing presumed Caland forms RV ákravihasta- and PN dabhī́
ti-, which
apparently show full grade of the root.
The neut. adjectives gómat and híraṇyavat are generally taken to refer directly
to the gifts that the Aśvins will provide us (e.g., Ge “Rinderbesitz … Goldbesitz (sie
uns)!” But (as Ge suggests in his note) in I.92.16 and VIII.22.17, where the pāda is
repeated, the adjectives modify vártiḥ ‘circuit, course’, in turn the object of forms of
√yā ‘drive’ in VIII.22.17 (and often elsewhere). Since 17b contains yātam, I supply
vártiḥ here as well.</p>
<h3 id="i3018">I.30.18</h3>
<p>Because yójana- has a number of different meanings (‘yoking, stage of
journey, distance, route’), the compound samānáyojana- has received a number of
different translations. The analytic phrase samānéna yójanena occurs in I.92.3 of
Dawn’s journey, where again ‘route’ best fits the context.</p>
<h3 id="i3019">I.30.19</h3>
<p>Other passages also depict the Aśvins’ chariot with one wheel at rest
(presumably on earth, on the ritual ground) and the other in motion (V.73.3,
VIII.22.4), as Ge explains in his note.
The “head of the inviolable (bull)” is somewhat opaque, but is probably a
mystical expression for the ritual ground – more clearly expressed in mūrdhán
yajñásya “on the head of the sacrifice” (II.3.2, IX.17.6). Others have speculated that
the whole complex (the two wheels and the bull’s head) refer to a constellation. See
WG n.

<h3 id="i3020">I.30.20</h3>
<p>“Fair-weather friend” translates the voc. kadhapriye and is an attempt at an
idiomatic English rendering of ‘when-friend’, i.e., ‘uncertain, fickle, or capricious
friend’ – following Bloomfield’s (RR, ad I.38.1) attractive explanation of closely
related kadhaprī́- as built to the Aśvins’ epithet adhapriyā ‘then-friends’. The epithet
is appropriate to the usually reliable Dawn in this verse because the poet questions
her as to where she will bestow her presence and favors.</p>
<h3 id="i3021">I.30.21</h3>
<p>All of pāda c is a vocative, though it is syntactically peculiar for the noun in
the simile to be in the vocative: áśve ná, literally “like o mare.” It must have been
attracted into the voc. by the voc. adjectives that are the points of comparison: citre
aruṣi “bright and ruddy.” See also I.57.3 below.</p>
<h2 id="i31-agni">I.31 Agni</h2>
<p>This is the first of five hymns attributed to Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa and the
only one addressed to Agni. It is noteworthy that the hymn begins and ends with
references to the Aṅgirases: 1a (agne &hellip;) áṅgirā ṛ́ṣiḥ, 2a (agne &hellip;) áṅgirastamaḥ and
17a (the last vs. before the extra-hymnic summary vs.) (agne) aṅgirasvád aṅgiraḥ, a
reference to his parentage and a word that often plays off its phonological similarity
to agní- (cf. RV I.1), a voc. of which occurs in every vs. in this hymn.
I.31.1-2: Some reciprocal vocabulary: in 1c the kavis (the Maruts) are born under the
vrata of Agni, while in 2b Agni as kavi tends to the vrata of the gods.</p>
<h3 id="i311">I.31.1</h3>
<p>Wackernagel treats the structure of the bahuvrīhi vidmanā́pas- differently in
different parts of the grammar. It is clear that the first member is the instr. of vidmán-
‘wisdom, know-how’, but in some places (II.1.234, III.268) he suggests that the 2nd
member is the secondary adj. apás- (so also Gr) and that the first member is accented
(as is customary in bahuvrīhis), but with end-accent vidmanā́, rather than the attested
independent vidmánā (I.110.6, etc.)(so explicitly III.268). Elsewhere (esp. II.1.301)
he groups it with other bahuvrīhis containing -as-stems as 2nd members, which have
accented 2nd members (on the 1st syllable), such as pṛthu-pákṣas- (and cf. purū-rávasin 4b). The latter analysis must be correct: inter alia, we don’t expect bahuvrīhis of
similar sense to have adjectives as 2nd members, and it seems arbitrary to assume
ending accent of the instr. against the independent usage of -n-stems. Therefore, the
cmpd. must represent vidmanā-ápas-, built to the neut. -as-stem ‘work’, inflected as
a masc. nom. pl. because the cmpd. is a bahuvrīhi and hence an adjective. The
meaning should be literally ‘having/displaying work with know-how’.</p>
<h3 id="i312">I.31.2</h3>
<p>In c note the phonetic figure vibhúr víśvasmai bhúvanāya, with the two
elements of the first word distributed over the next two.
Note that Agni here is said to have “two mothers” (dvimātā́), while in vs. 4 he
swells in his “two fathers” (pitróḥ; see also 9a) &ndash; in both cases referring to the
kindling sticks. Although both “two mothers” and “two fathers” can refer pregnantly,
35
as it were, to a mixed gender set of parents, it is striking that both are used so close
together here, and of the same referents.</p>
<h3 id="i313">I.31.3</h3>
<p>The mythology behind ab is related in I.143.2, as Ge points out; see also
VI.8.4. It is not clear here why a mythological situation should be couched in the
imperative (“become manifest!”), esp. as the second hemistich contains three
augmented imperfects, but I cannot see any way to fix it. As Old points out, various
scholars have suggested reading injunc. bhavaḥ but it is not easy to switch that form
in, esp. because 1) the hymn has no other injunctives, and 2) the stem bháva- doesn&rsquo;t
have any clear injunctives, certainly no bhavaḥ, in the RV. In I.143.2 the same myth
is related in the same phraseology in the impf.: ā́vír agnír abhavan mātaríśvane.
sukratūyā́must mean something more than simply krátvā / krátunā; see the
denom. sukratūyase in X.122.6.</p>
<h3 id="i314">I.31.4</h3>
<p>Purūravas is found only here in the RV outside of his dialogue with the
Apsaras Urvaśī in X.95. It’s not entirely clear why he is here, but his is a speaking
name (‘having much roaring’), which fits with the bellowing in pāda a. Moreover his
son Āyu figures several times in this hymn (vss. 2, 11), and Iḍā, said to be
Purūravas’s mother in X.95.18, also appears in vs. 11.
Contrary to most tr., I have segregated sukṛ́te sukṛ́ttaraḥ as a separate clause,
since this expression is found in different context in I.156.5. sukṛ́t- is usually used of
the priest or ritual performer, and this interpretation fits with the 2nd hemistich, which
refers to the ritual here and now. Starting a new sentence in pāda b also helps
mitigate the tense disharmony in this verse, where the present in the subordinate
clause (múcyase) is by most accounts connected to an imperfect in the main clause of
d (anayan), the action of which should temporally follow the verb in c (or to the
imperfect avāśayaḥ in a). By connecting c instead with the last part of b, this
temporal reversal is avoided.
Ge (following Gr) tr. śvātra- as simply “Kraft,” but the noun belongs with the
root √śū ‘swell’, and the image in this pāda is a vivid one: Agni’s “swelling” in his
two parents refers to the flaming up of the fire created by the kindling sticks (already
referred to in 2d). Both Re and WG render the ‘swell’ sense. With Sāy. (see Ge’s n.
4c) I take pitróḥ with śvātréṇa, not with múcyase. On “two fathers” see comm. ad vs.
2. Because of the contrast between the two mothers in 2 and the two fathers in this vs.
and 9a, I would now alter the tr. of both 4 and 9 to “in your two fathers.”
I do not understand what the final pāda is conveying. I have tr. pū́rvam …
áparam punaḥ as “to the east … then again to the west”; Ge has “vorwärts und
wieder zurück.” But in either case the ritual ref. is hard to decode, since generally the
fire “taken out” of what will later be called the Gārhapatya fire, situated at the west
of the ritual ground, is carried to the east to become what will later be called the
Āhavanīya fire. Sāy. (see Ge’s n. 4d) takes the vedi as the reference point, with one
part of the fire going to the east (Āhavanīya) and one to the west (Gārhyapatya), but
this is not how the placement of the ritual fires happens.

<h3 id="i315">I.31.5</h3>
<p>údyataśruce … śravā́yyaḥ: Ge’s (/WG’s) “ruhmbringend” is not possible for
śravā́yya-, because this is a (pseudo-)gerundive and hence passive. The dat.
údyataśruce can serve as agent, because RVic gerundives can take dat. agents (see
Jamison 1979 [Die Sprache 25] 137–38 n. 14), as also in other IE languages.
The publ. tr. renders bhavasi śravā́yyaḥ as “should be celebrated,” because a
more lit. “become one to be celebrated.” However, despite its awkwardness, the
more literal tr. should probably be prefered. The use of √bhū + GRDV may well
indicate that Agni/the ritual fire only deserves celebration after he/it has been kindled
and placed to the west. The ā́huti- in the next pāda may be an indirect ref. to the thusplaced fire as receiver of oblations, what will, by the time of the AV, be called the
Āhavanīya.
The rel. pronoun yáḥ in c has double reference: in c it refers to the priest in
the 3rd ps. and is the subject of accented védā; in d it refers to Agni in the 2nd ps. and
is the subject of the accented āvívāsasi. Both referents are present in the main cl.: the
priest as údyataśruce in b and Agni of course as tvám agne in a. This grammatical
play cannot be easily rendered in English.
ékāyu- is a hapax and also probably a pun. On the one hand it is formed like
viśvā́yu- ‘having a complete lifetime’, dīrghā́yu- ‘having a long lifetime’, hence
‘having a single lifetime’; on the other, it can contain the proper name of Āyu, who is
found in vss. 2 and 11 of the hymn, hence Ge’s tr. “im Alleinbesitz des Āyu,” WG
“den Āyu (als) einzigen (Opferer) hatte.” Although Ge (/WG) do not recognize the
“lifetime” possibility, the parallel formations make such a reading hard to avoid. In
the lifetime meaning, the compound presumably refers to the ritual fire’s duration
through a single sacrifice or, perhaps more likely, through the lifetime of the
sacrificer. In the personal-name reading, it would mean that Agni and our ritual fire
have the ur-Aryan sacrificer and clanlord (see 11b) Āyu on their side (‘having Āyu
as [yours] alone’?). In vs. 11 Agni is identified with Āyu the clanlord, and so here, in
that identity, he brings together the víśaḥ ‘clans’. The publ. tr. does not register the
personal-name reading, which should be remedied: I would add as an alternative tr.
“having Āyu as yours alone.”
ágre: Although in absolute usage this word can refer to the beginning of time,
as it were, that sense seems unlikely here because of the present tense verb. I
therefore consider it to reflect a phrase like ágre yajñásya (VII.15.5), at least in the
primary reading. Secondarily, with the second meaning of ékāyu- (‘having Āyu as
yours alone’), it may allude to the primal sacrifice.
I added the parenthetical “divine” qualifying “clans” because gods (or their
qualities) are the usual object of āvívāsa-, and I still think that is the more likely
interpretation. However, ET points out to me that, in light of vs. 11b tvā́m … devā́
akṛṇvan náhuṣasya viśpátim “You … did the gods create as the clan-lord of Nahuṣa,”
it might instead refer to human clans. Proferes (2007) argues at length, though not
mentioning this hymn, that a royal fire can unite several clans.</p>
<h3 id="i316">I.31.6</h3>
<p>sákman is a hapax, rendered by Ge as “in der Freundschaft” but by Re as “en
détresse” (followed explicitly by WG “aus der Not”). The former interpretation is
37
surely the correct one, taking it as a derivative of the very common root √sac
‘accompany’ and directly cognate with Aves (O+Y) haxman- ‘association,
community’. (So EWA s.v.) Re suggests a derivation rather from √sac2 ‘dry up’, but
the semantics of the derivation are not straightforward, and such a connection
requires both the apparent Avestan cognate and RVic hapax sákmya- ‘comradeship’
to be decoupled from sákman-. It is hard to see the motivation for this proposal. It
must have been that the context seemed not to be one of comradeship, but in fact
there is no problem with that meaning in context: Agni demonstrates his
comradeship with the man at issue by giving him aid.
I interpret the first hemistich to be entirely concerned with the sacrifice, as the
loc. vidáthe ‘at the ceremony’ suggests. In my view vṛjiná-vartani- ‘having twisting
turns’ envisions the sacrifice as a race-course, which the sacrificer must navigate, esp.
the tricky turn at the further end. That the sacrifice was commonly envisioned as a
course to traverse is clear from the word adhvará- ‘ceremony, rite’, related to
ádhvan- ‘road, way’ and found in expressions like rathī́r adhvarā́ṇām “charioteer of
the rites” (I.44.9, cf. VI.7.2). Although vṛjiná- ‘twisted, crooked’ often has a morally
negative sense (like its English glosses), in this case the twist(s) would simply be
tricky (that is, challenging) to steer. It is possible, with some other tr., to assume that
the twisting turns are not ritual but refer to unfortunate life circumstances, but then
vidáthe is hard to account for.
The image of the sacrifice as a race-course in ab then transitions to the image
of a race or contest in general in pāda c. páritakmye ‘at the crucial turn’ picks up the
vṛjinávartani- of pāda a. As so often, dháne is a truncated loc. absol. for the common
expression dháne hité (I.40.2, etc.) “when the stake is set.” Contra Gr and Ge, I do
not take páritakmye as an adj. with dháne; like me, Re. and WG keep the two
expressions separate, and Re. suggests that páritakmye dháne is “abregé” from
páritakmyāyām … dháne hité. Although I am leery of characterizations like “abregé,”
in this case I think that the form we have has been manipulated in some such way. Gr
lists an adj. páritakmya- to which our form is said to belong, but this stem does not
exist: all clear forms belong to the fem. noun páritakmyā-, almost all of whose forms
are loc. sg. páritakmyāyām at the end of a Triṣṭubh line. This stem is subject to
various poetic deformations: see comm. ad V.30.113–14. I believe that our
páritakmye here also belongs to this noun stem and reflects a loc.; it is positioned
exactly like the páritakmyāyām forms, at the end of a trimeter line after an opening
of 5. But to conform to the Jagatī line this loc. has been replaced by an apparent
masc./neut. loc. in -e, and the independent loc. absol. dháne has been added to supply
the requisite light + anceps ending. For further on the phrase dhána- hitá- see comm.
ad VI.45.
The last pāda thus turns the contest image into an actual battle; the line
between contest and battle is a thin and permeable one in the RV.</p>

In the 2nd hemistich kṛṇóṣi has a complex direct and indirect object phrase:
ubháyāya jánmane máyaḥ kṛṇóṣi práya ā́ca sūráye, with the chiasmic structure DAT.-
IO ACC-DO VERB ACC-DO DAT-IO arranged around the verb. In such a structure we
might expect coordinating ca to be positioned immediately after the 1st term of the
second object complex, that is, after práyaḥ (práyaś ca); see Klein DGRV I.54 and
passim. The interruption of this balanced construction by ā́is also curious; the point
seems to be that Agni makes refreshment for the first, mixed set of beneficiaries in
an unspecified place but the meal for the patron right here (ā́) on the ritual ground. It
may be that the propensity of ca to follow preverbs in tmesis (/adverbal usage) has
dictated the position; Klein implies as much (DGRV I.134 and n. 49, 227).</p>
<h3 id="i318">I.31.8</h3>
<p>The question in ab is who is winning the stakes. I take it to be “us,” with our
winning enabled by Agni’s giving glory to our poet. Most take it to be the poet
himself, a poet identified as ours (“for our bard to win the stakes”). This is certainly
possible. Indeed Old (SBE) actually interprets sanáye … kṛṇuhi as a periphrastic
causative “make/cause to win,” with the poet the first object. Although Zehnder
(Periphrastic Kaus., 2011) does not discuss this passage, he does recognize (p. 61)
other examples of periphrastic causatives to √san ‘win’, which does not build a
morphological causative (expect *sānáyati, or possibly *sanáyati, neither of which
would cause phonological problems). Of course at this period of the language,
underlying transitive verbs like √san should not build double transitive causatives
(“cause X to win Y”).
apásā návena: the suffixal accent of apásā should rule out a tr. ‘work’, but
most tr. ignore (Re actually cites it in his notes as ápas-) or overrule the accent. So
Ge “durch das neue Machwerk” (i.e., the hymn), sim. Re, WG. Although Gr cites
other forms of apás- in the meaning ‘work’, none of these is convincing. Therefore,
although it would simplify the tr. to take it as neut. ‘work’, the transmitted text can
only mean ‘worker, laborer’. My tr. implies that we have a new poet, or perhaps the
bard, made glorious by Agni in pāda b, who takes a new lease on his poetic life.
Alternatively, we might follow Old (SBE), who alone paid attention to the accent and
tr. “with the help of the young active (Agni).”
The introduction of Heaven and Earth as recipients of our prayers in the last
pāda of this vs. is odd, giving the vs. the appearance of a hymn-final vs., since
extraneous gods are often brought in at that point. The fact that the vs. is in Triṣṭubh,
rather than the Jagatī that prevails in the hymn (save for 16 and 18) also supports the
view that this vs. marks at least an internal boundary, and though the initial tváṃ (no)
agne sequence continues in the vss. that follow, the subject matter subtly changes.
See publ. intro.
Note the phonological play in bc (… kārúṃ kṛṇuhi … kárma), which may
imply a folk-etymological connection of kārú- ‘bard’ with √kṛ, and in d (devair
dyāvā pṛthivī prā́vatam)
I.31.9-11: Some patterned responsion in these two verses: 9 tanū-kṛ́t … prámatiḥ / 10
prámatiḥ … vayas-kṛ́t. However, although these two verses are roughly in the middle
39
of the hymn and patterned responsion is characteristic of omphalos verses, the
repetitions do not seem sufficiently important to constitute an omphalos. On the
relationship between prámati- and váyas- and between tanū- and váyas- see disc. ad
I.71.7, where it is suggested that tanū́- and váyas- are the tangible and intangible
elements that together make up a living being.
The “two fathers” in 9a ushers in the paternal imagery found in the rest of 9–
11 (and beyond). Besides the tanū-kṛ́t- ‘body-creator’ and váyas-kṛ́t- ‘life-forcecreator’, which jointly define the parental contribution to a new human being, we
have the repeated word prámati- ‘solicitude’, which is strongly associated with the
father (see disc. ad I.71.7). Here the word first appears by itself in 9c, then along
with pitā́- in 10a (as well as 14c, 16c). The father figure in these vss. switches back
and forth: Agni is first “in the lap of his two fathers” (thus implicitly the son) in 9a,
but has the fatherly role in 9cd, 10ab &ndash; then switching back to the son in 11d. The
two remaining allusions to the father (14c, 16c) cast Agni in that role again.</p>
<h3 id="i319">I.31.9</h3>
<p>As noted above (ad vs. 4), I would now change “your two parents” to “your
two fathers” because of the contrast with the “two mothers” of 2.
The naḥ in 2nd position in the vs. does not fit easily into the first hemistich
(though cf. Ge “Du Agni (sei) uns im Schosse der Eltern als Gott …”). I have
postponed it to the 2nd hemistich &ndash; with no verb in the 1st this seems possible &ndash; and
taken it as a gen. dependent on kāráve ‘bard. It could also be taken as a dat. with
tanūkṛ́t in a chiasmic construction exactly like that of 7cd discussed above. Hence,
“become body-creator for us and fatherly solicitude for the bard. Otherwise it might
be possible just to assume that it was generated to the pattern tváṃ (no) agne in the
rest of the hymn, when another syllable was needed. Both Re and Old (SBE) simply
ignore it.</p>
<h3 id="i3111">I.31.11</h3>
<p>On Āyu and Iḍā see disc. ad vs. 4 above. This verse clearly refers to the
primal institution of the ritual fire at the Ārya sacrifice, but the details are somewhat
obscure.
Because of the tense differences between c and d (augmented impf. akṛṇvan
vs. pres. jā́yate), I follow Re in taking d as the content of Iḍā’s instruction, namely
that in mundane current-day terms Agni/ritual fire has a mere human father, the
sacrificer, though it was the gods who originally created him/it.
I would now tr. mánuṣasya as “of Manu,” since this refers to the original
establishment of the sacrifice.</p>
<h3 id="i3112">I.31.12</h3>
<p>The theme of protection gets hammered home by the use of three different
roots in this semantic sphere: √pā (pāyúbhiḥ a), √rakṣ (rakṣa b, rakṣamāṇaḥ d), and
√trā (trātā́c ).
In the conjoined NP maghónaḥ … tanvàś ca, tanváḥ must be reflexive “(we)
ourselves,” despite tanū-kṛ́t, where tanū- refers specifically to the body.
40
In c the standard tr. construe the genitives tókasya .. gávām with trātā́, but I
take them with tánaye, which they flank, as in the symmetrical constructions
discussed above ad vss. 7 and, possibly, 9.
Pāda d can be seen as a paraphrase of 9b, with ánimēṣaṃ rákṣamāṇaḥ
“unblinkingly watchful” an expansion of jā́gṛviḥ “wakeful,” and of 10d, with
rákṣamāṇas táva vraté “watchful in accord with your commandment” expanding
vratapā́- “protector of the commandment.”</p>
<h3 id="i3113">I.31.13</h3>
<p>The man who lacks even a quiver lacks weapons and is therefore defenseless.
My interpr. of cd differs significantly from the standard (though it is close to
Ge’s alternate, given at the end of his n. on 13cd). Most take yó rātáhavyaḥ as a
nominal rel. cl. referring to the worshipper, with coreferential resumptive pronoun
tám in the main clause vanóṣi tám, whose subject is Agni (e.g., Ge “Wer Opfer
spendet … den begehrst du.”). (Its initial position in its clause would of course
account for the accent on the main verb.) This interpretation has several merits: the
skeletal syntactic structure is clear; it explains the unusual position of the tám; it
parallels the structure of 14b; and rātáhavya- is more often used of mortals than of
gods (a usage that might be supported here by the parallel compound
práyatadakṣiṇa- in 15a). However, it makes the phrase kīréś cin mántram mánasā
impossible to construe: the acc. sg. mántram has nothing governing it, and the
“solution” in such tr. is simply to set it off by dashes and hope for the best. I
therefore prefer to take cd as a single relative clause with Agni as subject. The adj.
rātáhavya- can modify gods, including Agni in IV.7.7. This reconfiguring of the
syntax allows mántram to be the obj. of vanóṣi, with the point being that Agni, by
properly performing his ritual duties, acquires a powerful mantra for the weakling in
his charge. (The perhaps overly heavy tr. “mental spell” was meant to highlight the
etymological relationship with mánas- ‘mind’.)
My interpretation differs from the standard in other smaller ways. In c I take
dhā́yase not as a quasi-infinitive to √dhā ‘place, establish’ (e.g., Ge “um sich
Sicherheit zu schaffen”), a formation not otherwise found, but to the standard s-stem
dhā́yas- ‘nourishment’ to √dhā(y) ‘nourish’. I also take kīréś cid with the preceding
dative phrase, rather than with mántram.</p>
<h3 id="i3114">I.31.14</h3>
<p>Again my interpr. differs from the standard, though not as radically as in vs.
13. Most tr. take ab as a single clause with, implicitly, an embedded nominal relative
clause spā́rhaṃ yád réknaḥ paramám. The main clause resumes with vanóṣi, hence
the accent, and the yád clause is picked up by tád. The problem is that the RV does
not ordinarily allow embedded relatives; (almost) all relative clauses are either preor postposed, as M. Hale has argued in the past. I therefore supply the frame “you are
kindled as protector” + DATIVE from the parallel vs. 13ab. Note that Agni as
protector also begins the next verse (15).
The phrase prá pā́kaṃ śā́ssi prá díśaḥ in d causes problems, because, despite
the strong superficial parallelism, the two accusatives pā́kam and díśaḥ do not appear
to be parallel. I have translated them as parallel, but admit the awkwardness. If the
41
verb prá śāssi is used in the same way in both iterations, the “quarters,” that is, the
geographical directions, are receiving the same instruction as the simple man. In
support of this interpretation ET remarks “my guess is that the poet intends a contrast
between two extremes (the limited simple man and the vast semi-divine quarters) as
recipients of instruction from the one who is superior to all in knowledge.” Ge supplies a
different verb with the second prá phrase: “du (gibst) Weisungen,” suggesting that
while pā́kam refers to the person who receives the instruction, díśaḥ might rather
express the content (“directions”) of the instruction.</p>
<h3 id="i3115">I.31.15</h3>
<p>In upamā́I prefer to see the first attestation of the root noun compound
upamā́- ‘likeness’ (&lt; ‘measure’), rather than the adverbial instrumental preferred by
Old and apparently followed by the standard tr. How an instr. would function here is
not clear to me, and Ge’s “der kommt zu oberst im Himmel” seems to push sópamā́
diváḥ further than the meager expression will take it. Old’s objection is that for such
a root noun we would expect nom. sg. upamā́ḥ, but this isn’t apposite: in this sandhi
situation upamā́would be the outcome in any case, so it is only the Pp. reading that
enforces an underlying -ā́final. Moreover, the parallel compounds pramā́- and
pratimā́- are attested in the RV with clear asigmatic nom. sg. (X.130.3), suggesting
that they have been reinterpreted as -ā-stems (see Scar p. 378). There is no reason
that an upamā́- wouldn’t have been treated similarly. See also upamā́in VIII.60.13.</p>
<h3 id="i3116">I.31.16</h3>
<p>I interpret mīmṛṣaḥ slightly differently with its two different objects, as
“make X forgotten” and “make us forget X” respectively. The verb ‘forget’ is an I/T
verb of perception (in the terms of my 1983 book), and its causative thus can take
two different types of constructions.
Agni is “whirling” (bhṛ́mi-) because of the movements of his smoke and
flames.
[I.32 JPB]
[SJ] I.32.9: John Clayton (p.c.) points out the phonological similarity of the
coreferential dā́nuḥ and dhenúḥ, polarized at the beginning and end of pāda d, in
frame and simile respectively. This is one of two places in the RV where we meet
Vṛtra’s mother by name (and indeed at all), the other being in the bahuvr. sahádānuin III.30.8. Vṛtra himself is called dānavá- on several occasions (II.11.10, V.30.1, 4,
7, probably V.29.4, the only 5 occurrences of this stem). I am inclined to see this
designation of Vṛtra as equivalent to YAves. dānauua- (Barth. 2
dānav- “bezeichnet
einen den Iraniern feindlichen tūrischen Volksstamm”), with the name of Vṛtra’s
mother Dānu backformed from that – rather than taking Dānu as the name of a
riverine goddess, who may or may not be attested elsewhere in IE (esp. Celtic), as
some others do.
In any case the stem(s) dā́nu- are difficult to sort out. In addition to the fem.
form here (perhaps coerced into that gender), there are 4 masc. forms referring to a
demon or demons (pl. only in the late X.120.6), with the 3 sgs. either referring
clearly to Vṛtra (II.11.18, also containing dānavá- in vs. 10; II.12.13) or with Vṛtra
42
as likely referent (IV.30.7). In addition there are the neuts. dā́nu- ‘gift’ and dā́nu-
‘drop’, which are hard to separate in context, since “drops” (of rain, esp.) are also
“gifts.” There is also a single fem. form that must belong to one of these otherwise
neut. stems, in I.54.7, whose non-neut. gender is shown by the nom. sg. -s and its
specifically fem. gender by the adj. úparā (dā́nur asmā úparā pinvate diváḥ “For him
the gift [/drop] of heaven swells here below.”). In context this fem. obviously cannot
designate Vṛtra’s mother. I have no explanation. It is worth noting that what anchors
dā́nuḥ as a fem. in I.54.7 is the adj. úparā based on the directional preverb úpa, just
as in our passage the feminine is established earlier in the hemistich by the phrase
úttarā sū́ḥ “the mother was above,” with the adj. based on the directional preverb úd.
[SJ] I.32.12: This vs. contains a famous crux. The first hemistich reads áśvyo vā́ro
abhavas tád indra, srké yát tv ̥ ā pratyáhan devá ékaḥ, rendered (up through
pratyáhan) in the publ. tr. as ‘You, Indra, then became the tail of a horse when he
struck his fangs at you’. Indra is clearly addressed in the 2nd ps., as shown in pāda a
by the 2nd sg. abhavaḥ and the voc. indra and in pāda b by acc. tvā. This means, by
easy process of elimination, that the subject of the verb pratyáhan ‘struck at’ must be
Vṛtra. What then to do with the following nominative phrase, devá ékaḥ ‘the one god,
the god alone’? Indra’s arch-opponent in the Rig Veda is emphatically not a god, and
certainly with Indra on the scene he could not be the one god. There are several
alternative solutions to this conflict between grammar and sense: to read this
nominative phrase as an independent nominal clause, or as a continuation of the
clause in pāda a with the dependent clause sr̥ké yát tvā pratyáhan embedded within it
(the solution in the publ. tr.), or as anticipating the next hemistich, where Indra
returns as the 2nd sg. subject of the verbs ájayaḥ ‘you conquered’, etc. Thus, the first
possibility: ‘you became the tail of a horse when he struck his fangs at you; (you are)
the one god / (you as) god (were) alone’ (etc.); for the second: ‘o Indra, you became
the tail of a horse &ndash; when he struck his fangs at you &ndash; (you) the god alone’; for the
third: ‘you became the tail of a horse when he struck his fangs at you; as god alone,
you conquered …’. None of these is impossible, but they are all ad hoc, constructed
under desperate circumstances to avoid the semantic clash between the undoubted
subject of the verb pratyáhan, namely Vṛtra, and the immediately following
nominative phrase that should not modify him.
There is a potential way out of this conundrum, however. The verb áhan is the
3rd sg. imperfect to the famous root present hánti; its older form should have been
*ahant. I tentatively suggest that the sequence *áhant evá, containing the emphatic
particle evá, at an early stage underwent external sandhi voicing assimilation to
*áhand evá and then resegmentation to áhan devá, rather than displaying the
expected synchronic sandhi development to *áhann evá. This aberrant
resegmentation was facilitated by the existence of the ubiquitous noun devá- and the
following adj. ékaḥ, with which that noun could be construed. My proposed
underlying original *áhand *evá ékaḥ has the particle evá stationed after the verb to
emphasize the unusual use of Indra’s signature verb áhan, found in this hymn five
times with Indra as subject (1c, 2a, 3d, 4a, 5a; cf. also 11c jaghanvā́n in the vs.
43
immediately preceding ours), with Vṛtra as subject. The following ékaḥ emphasizes
the single combat between Indra and Vṛtra: the equal balance between the two
opponents is a feature of this part of the hymn &ndash; cf. esp. 13c índraś ca yád yuyudhā́te
áhiś ca “When Indra and the serpent fought with each other …,” with middle dual
verb and conjoined subject NP. This contrasts sharply with the much more one-sided
depiction of the battle in the earlier parts of the hymn. I would therefore translate 12b
as ‘when just he, alone, struck his fangs against you’.
One major stumbling block to accepting this scenario: the sandhi of *evá ékaḥ.
The hiatus found in the transmitted text in the sequence devá ékaḥ is of course
expected from underlying *devás ékaḥ (/*deváḥ/z), with loss of the final consonant of
the nom. sg. and the resulting hiatus maintained. But we would ordinarily expect the
final vowel of the particle evá to coalesce with the initial of ékaḥ to produce *evaíkaḥ
(as in IV.54.5, X.44.7 evaívá, X.173.2 ihaívaídhi). However, the application of the
sandhi rules governing the coalescence of final and initial vowels is by no means
exceptionless. For further discussion, with reff., see my “Hidden in Plain Sight:
Some Older Verb Endings in the Rig Veda” in a forthcoming festschrift.</p>

The transitive thematic subjunctive vāvṛdhāti is assigned to the “Aorist des
Caus.” by Gr, but the properly formed redupl. caus. aorist ávīvṛdha- occupies that
slot. Other than our form, all forms belonging to the vāvṛdha- stem are medial, and it
seems best to follow Kü (471) in seeing this thematic stem as built to the perfect in
order to allow the root-final consonant to be maintained in forms like 2nd sg. impv.
vāvṛdhásva (since athem. *vāvṛtsvá could be taken to the root √vṛt ‘turn’); see now
further my 2017 art. on perf. impv (García Ramón Fs.). These medial intrans./reflex.
forms in turn generated the oppositional trans. act. vāvṛdhāti.
I take kétam páram in d as referring to Indra’s “distant intention” (which we
hope to move closer to us; see úpa in 1a, 2a), rather than our “highest wish,” as is
standard. The middle voice of āvárjate may support this. However the other
interpretation is certainly possible.</p>

The phrase ékaś cáran is a first instantiation of the lexeme famous in much
later times from the Rhinoceros(-horn) Sūtra. For the phrase in the dharma lit. and
the association with the rhinoceros (not, in my opinion, its horn), see Jamison 1998.
upaśāká- is only here, but śāká- is several times used of the Maruts or
Aṅgirases in their roles as helpers of Indra (IV.17.11, V.30.10). Therefore, though
there is a disjunction between “going it alone” and being accompanied by a host of
helpers, I take upaśākébhiḥ as personal here. The upa- may mark them as particularly
subsidiary, or it may simply have been prefixed to the stem because it is a signature
word in this part of the hymn.
Other tr. take sanaká- as the name of a group, but it seems a perfectly wellformed -ka-suffixed form of sána- ‘old’, with a pejorative diminutive sense
appropriate to belittling one’s enemies. So Edgerton (1911 [k-suffixes]): 53): “the old
rascals.” My “old codgers” is also an attempt to capture the slangy and deprecatory
tone. On the demotic value of -ka- see Jamison 2009 (IIJ 52).
Ge takes prétim īyuḥ as an idiom “gingen in den Tod,” but despite the later
such usage of pra √i, this idiom does not appear in the RV. As indicated in the intro.,
I take this as referring to the separation of sacrificers from non-sacrificers.</p>
<h3 id="i335">I.33.5</h3>
<p>Because the verb in d, adhamaḥ, is unaccented, something must be supplied to
complete the subordinate clause of c (prá yád …). It seems simplest to supply a form
of the verb √i ‘go’, esp. as prá √i is found in 4d. Ge’s solution, to supply the same
verb as in d, is possible, but seems pleonastic.</p>
<h3 id="i336">I.33.6</h3>
<p>The Navagvas are ordinarily adherents of Indra’s. In order to preserve this
alliance, we must assume that the plural reference in pādas a-c alternates, with a and
c referring to Indra’s enemies, and b to his friends.
vṛṣāyúdho ná vádhrayaḥ is the clearest echo in this hymn of the phraseology
of the immediately preceding, very famous hymn depicting the Indra-Vṛtra battle:
I.32.7c vṛ́ṣṇo vádhriḥ pratimā́nam búbhūṣan “a steer who tried to be the measure of a
bull.”
citáyantaḥ is unclear, as forms built to this stem often are, and the tr. differ
appreciably: Ge “zu Einsicht kommend,” WG “erkennend,” Re “se rendant compte.”
In my opinion, it is in its usual intrans. value “appearing” and adds a simile-like
aspect to the main verb āyan, a sort of utprekṣā.</p>
<h3 id="i338">I.33.8</h3>
<p>The verse is full of adornment/clothing terms; clear are śúmbhamāna-
‘adorning themselves’ in b and pari √dhā ‘clothe’ in c. In pāda a the middle
participle cakrāṇā́saḥ has a clear parallel in the adornment phrase in VIII.14.5
45
cakrāṇá opaśáṃ diví “creating for himself a headdress in heaven.” As in the previous
verses, there seem to be two contending sides, the enemies found in pādas abc and
the friends in d. “Having made for themselves a girdle from the earth” in a is easily
interpretable in this framework: the enemies have fallen and are perhaps dead,
partially covered by earth. But “adorning themselves with a golden amulet” in b is
more difficult, since a golden amulet sounds like a positive decorative item. However,
Younger Avestan has a compound zarənu-maini (Yt. 14.33), apparently made of
related verbal material, which is the epithet of a vulture, found in a passage in which
the vulture espies bloody meat from far distances. If there is a connection between
the two (see EWA s.v. maṇí), “to adorn oneself with a golden amulet” may mean
figuratively “to become food for vultures.” In contrast to Indra’s doomed adversaries
in ab, in d he clothes his “spies” with the sun; sunlight is often a symbol of
untroubled life, as in the often repeated wish “to see the sun” (sū́ryaṃ dṛśé and
related expressions).
For a detailed discussion of this vs., esp. pāda b and its Iranian correspondents,
see my “A Golden Amulet in Vedic and Avestan” (Ged. H.-P. Schmidt). I would now
emend the publ. tr. of pāda a to “having made for themselves a coverlet from the
earth.”</p>
<h3 id="i339">I.33.9</h3>
<p>ET points out that the verb of ab pári … ábubhojīḥ “you coiled around” might
be more appropriate as a description of Vṛtra; it is almost as if Indra is appropriating
the qualities of his opponents in addition to his own and thereby showing himself to
be even more powerful. The form ábubhojīḥ itself is isolated, the only reduplicated
form to the root √bhuj ‘bend’. Kü gives it a lemma in his monograph on the perfect
(351–52) but does not commit himself further, beyond stating that the form is a 2nd sg.
preterite “in der statisch-attingenten Bedeutung” and suggesting that there might
have originally been a stative perfect that is no longer alive in Vedic. This would
allow a plausible analysis of our form as a pluperfect, with a renewed ending –īs, to
avoid expected but non-transparent *abubhok. JL points to the mirror-image phonetic
echo ubhe ábubhojīr across the pāda boundary.
adhamaḥ in d needs to be read with both pādas, c and d.</p>
<h3 id="i3310">I.33.10</h3>
<p>The rel. clauses with plural subj. in ab have no possible connection with
anything in the second hemistich. I take them instead as completing the portrayal of
the conflict between the two moieties depicted in the earlier parts of the hymn. The
pl. rel. prn. yé has no direct antecedent in the preceeding pāda (9d), though it can
pick up the intent of sg. dásyum; it can also hark a little further back to 9c
ámanyamānān ‘heedless ones,’ as H-P Schmidt suggests (B+I).
If pādas ab close the preceding myth, the rest of the verse seems to allude
glancingly to the Vṛtra (c) and Vala (d) myths.</p>
<h3 id="i3311">I.33.11</h3>
<p>abhí dyū́n: acc. pl. dyū́n almost always refers to ‘days’ (as in the expression
ánu dyū́n “through the days,” which regularly occupies this same metrical position.
However, pace Re’s “pour toujours” (which is, in any event, not equivalent to
46
“through the days”), a temporal interpretation does not work here. Ge (/WG) “für die
Himmels(götter),” for which there is no support (their I.190.4 is better tr. otherwise)
and whose datival “für” is an odd rendering of abhí. My “to high heavens” (the “high”
being imported from the English idiom) rests on the adj. abhídyu- ‘heaven-bound’; as
ET suggests it can be taken as a decomposition of this adjective, which, as it happens,
is almost always pāda final.</p>
<h3 id="i3312">I.33.12</h3>
<p>Bloomfield’s disc. of the 2nd hemistich (RR) is interpretively useful, though
somewhat dismissively phrased. It is too long to paraphrase here, but he acutely
observes that previous translators have glossed over the problem that Indra is
uncharacteristically depicted as at the end of his strength.</p>
<h3 id="i3313">I.33.13</h3>

<p>“Three times a day” (tríḥ … adyá) opens the hymn, announcing the hymn’s
“three” theme and also linking it to the three pressings of (some Ṛgvedic versions of)
the Soma Sacrifice.
Predicative voc. navedasā here rendered as part of a phrasal verb, with impv.
bhavatam.
The second hemistich is built on an etymological relationship between the
instrument noun yantrá- (c) and the gerundive abhyāyaṃsénya- (d), both built to the
root √yam ‘hold’ (the second form presumably to the s-aor. of that root; so AiG
II.2.503, though the reason for using this base isn’t clear). This word play is lost in
Ge’s (/WG’s) tr., but I have aimed to keep it, unfortunately producing some
awkwardness in the English.</p>
<h3 id="i344">I.34.4</h3>
<p>suprāvyè: prāvī́- and related forms I take, following Old (Noten ad II.13.9;
also Scar. 501) to √vī ‘pursue’, rather than to √av ‘help’ (e.g., Gr). The forms are
specialized for the pursuit of ritual activities.
tredhéva “as if threefold” presumably refers to the Aśvins, who, though only
being a pair, are as effective as if they were three.
With Ge (/WG) I take akṣárā (in akṣáreva) as nom. sg. fem., corresponding to
the Aśvins, who are subject to pinvatam. See Old’s somewhat inconclusive disc.
(ZDMG 63 [=KlSch p. 310]) of the various options. Rivelex (I.16–17) takes it as a
neut. nom. pl. collective; Gr. also as a neut. pl., though without specifying case.</p>
<h3 id="i345">I.34.5</h3>
<p>sū́re duhitā́“daughter of the Sun” preserves, by most accounts, the archaic
sandhi of final -as &gt; -e before initial dental. For further disc., see Jamison 2010 (Fs.

Melchert). The myth on which this pāda is based, Sūryā’s marriage, is not otherwise
mentioned in this hymn. On the formulaic representation of the myth in the RV see
Jamison 2001 (Fs. Parpola).</p>
<h3 id="i346">I.34.6</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) take mámakāya as referring to the poet himself (“… meiner
Wenigkeit”), with sūnáve in apposition and identifying the poet as the Aśvins’ son
(“als (eurem) Sohne”). This is certainly possible and in line with the self-deprecatory
use of mámaka- in I.31.11 for the poet-sacrificer’s self-reference. It is by no means
necessary, however, and it does introduce extra machinery.</p>
<h3 id="i347">I.34.7</h3>
<p>On aśāyatam see VI.33.2.
ātméva vā́taḥ is an underlying grammatical pun. Though vā́ta- is of course an
Indo-Iranian word for ‘wind’, historically it is actually a thematized present
participle to the ‘blow’ root. Here I think it is an adjective ‘blowing’ qualifying ā̛tmā́,
which is itself being compared to wind in this simile. ātmán- here shows its older
‘(life-)breath’ sense, not the ‘self, soul’ that already begins to take over in the RV.</p>
<h3 id="i348">I.34.8</h3>
<p>I take the kṛtám in b as predicated of both āhāvā́ḥ and havíḥ, with number
agreement with the nearer noun and slightly different senses (at least in English).</p>
<h3 id="i349">I.34.9</h3>
<p>The “three wheels” (trī́cakrā́) here are surely imposed by the insistent “three”
theme of this hymn. Vedic chariots ordinarily had two wheels (see Sparreboom, Ved.
Ch., 10–11), and how a third wheel would even be affixed isn’t clear to me.</p>
<h3 id="i3410">I.34.10</h3>
<p>It is a physical oddity that the two Aśvins are apparently credited with plural
mouths. There are two possible solutions: 1) The plural expression has been adopted
from elsewhere. There is one other occurrence of madhupébhir āsábhiḥ (IV.45.3),
unfortunately also in an Aśvins hymn; however, other examples of āsábhiḥ occur in
plural context. 2) The mouths don’t belong exclusively to the Aśvins, but to other
soma-drinking gods. The 33 gods who accompany the Aśvins here for drinking in the
next verse might support this possibility.</p>

<p>I take kṛṣṇā́rájāṃsi loosely as an accusative of extent. Others (Ge, Re) supply
a verb to govern this phrase (‘verbreitend’ and ‘pour traverser” respectively), while
still others (Macd., Falk 1988, WG) take it as a second acc. with dádhānaḥ, as
appositive to táviṣīm “assuming the dark realms as his power.” This latter solution is
possible grammatically and does not require additional material to be supplied, but I
am somewhat dubious that the dark realms constitute his power.
48</p>
<h3 id="i356">I.35.6</h3>
<p>This verse of cosmic mystery decked out in numerology comes as a surprise
after the simple, descriptive beginning of this hymn. The syntax of c is ambiguous:
Ge (Re / WG) takes amṛ́tā as nom. pl., supplying “him” as acc. with ádhi √sthā:
“Alles Unsterbliche ruht (auf ihm)…” I follow Old, who takes it as acc. pl., citing
III.38.4 ā́viśvárūpo amṛ́tāni tasthau “Having all forms, he mounted on the immortal
(things?).”</p>
<h3 id="i357">I.35.7</h3>
<p>In some ways a responsive verse to the previous one(s): ví … akhyat (a)
parallels 5a ví … akhyan; ciketa (c) responds to cíketat in 6d; and the three heavens
of 6a are alluded to in the query in 7d katamā́ṃ dyā́m “to which heaven (of three or
more)?”</p>
<h3 id="i358">I.35.8</h3>
<p>In b I read trī́with both dhánva and yójanā (taking both as neut. pl.). The
position of the numeral favors taking it with dhánva, which could, however, be
singular; in favor of reading the numeral (also) with yójanā is X.86.20 dhánva ca yát
krntátram ca, káti svit t ̥ ā́ví yójanā “Wasteland and chasm &ndash; how many yojanas (of
distance) are they away (from here).” (Note that dhánva is singular in that passage.)</p>
<h3 id="i3510">I.35.10</h3>
<p>On svávām̐as nom. sg. of the -s-stem sv-ávas-, see AiG III.287. The Pp.
analyses it rather as svá-vān ‘possessing property’. Curiously Macdonell (Ved.
Reader, ad loc.) claims to be following the Pp., but tr. ‘aiding well’.
Most tr. take pratidoṣám as a temporal, “towards evening” or “every evening.”
I think rather that it’s spatial, construed naturally with ásthāt ‘took his place, stood’.
The god is facing west. (Cf. Peter Pan: “straight on ‘til morning,” presumably
meaning ‘east’.) The same expression, also of Savitar, is found in VI.71.4, though it
does not clinch the interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="i3511">I.35.11</h3>
<p>Although it is possible to construe c directly with d, it seems best, following
Ge, to supply a verb of motion in c. The d pāda has a close parallel in I.114.10,
suggesting that it is independent.
Note the unusual duplication of the nominal referent in both rel. and main
clause: yé … pánthāḥ … / tébhiḥ … pathíbhiḥ.</p>
<h2 id="i36-agni">I.36 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="i361">I.36.1</h3>
<p>purūṇā́m is generally construed as qualifying yahvám, but this requires taking
the latter as an implicit superlative (Ge “den Jüngsten unter vielen”), which it is not.
(JL points out that a derivative of the real superlative, yáviṣṭhya, appears twice in the
hymn, vss. 6, 15.) Better to take it as parallel to viśā́m, though, since víś- is fem., not
modifying it as Proferes (2007: 31) does.
I.36.10, 17: As often, it is difficult to know when to tr. analyzable words as PNs
rather than literally. There is no particular reason that I explicitly allowed both
possibilities in vs. 10 and only the PN in 17.

<p>On vidā́versus vidā́ḥ, see comm. ad IX.19.6. Since the verb is parallel to
three impvs. (pāhi a, daha b, kṛdhī́c), an imperatival interpr. works better than a

<p>Ge (/WG) takes dásyave sáhaḥ as a phrasal personal name “Dasyave Sahas,”
a personal name that would have to be neuter. Better to follow Old (SBE) by taking it
as a qualifier of Agni. Re also rejects the personal name interpr., but considers it a
pāda-final truncation of the instr. sáhasā. (Because sáhaḥ can be construed without
problem as the nom./acc. neut. it appears to be, there is no reason to resort either to
Re’s truncation or to an archaic instr. sg. zero-grade ending *-h1 in the mode of Hale
[Fs. Melchert].) Old’s interpretation finds support in 19, where the second pāda
contains an entirely parallel phrase qualifying Agni, with neut. noun construed with
benefactive dative: jyótir jánāya “a light for the people.”</p>
<h3 id="i3619">I.36.19</h3>
<p>ukṣitá- is ppl. to both √vakṣ/ukṣ ‘grow’ and √ukṣ ‘sprinkle’; both meanings

<h2 id="i37-maruts">I.37 Maruts</h2>
<h3 id="i371">I.37.1</h3>
<p>There are two ways to take the apparent masc. acc. phrase anarvā́ṇaṃ
ratheśúbham in b. In the publ. tr. I interpret ratheśúbh- as a noun, ‘beauty on a
chariot’, modified by masc. anarvā́ṇam, with the phrase an appositive to the neut.
śárdho mā́rutam in pāda a. But there are some problems with this. First, the indep.
noun śúbh- is fem. Of course, its acc. is also śúbham, and it is arguable that the
bahuvrīhi adj. anarván- would make a fem. of the shape -ā́ṇam, rather than a deriv.
fem. *anarvaṇī- (acc. *-aṇīm). So the interpr. of the publ. tr. remains (barely)
possible. However, the standard tr. treat the phrase as adjectival with the preceding
neut. acc. This interpr. finds support in V.56.9 śárdhaṃ ratheśúbham, with masc.
śárdham, and also from VI.48.15, where masc. acc. anarvā́ṇam apparently modifies
the same neut. phrase as here, but in a simile śárdho ná mā́rutam. See comm. ad loc.
To construct a proper neut. for our phrase here is enough to provide the answer:
50
*anarvá *ratheśúp is remarkably unappealing, and a slide into a form more
recognizably acc. and more recognizably associated with the underlying stems is
easy to understand. For anarvá- see comm. ad I.185.3.
I.37.1-2: An “improper” relative construction, with masc. pl. yé in 2a picking up
śárdhaḥ ‘troop’ of 1a, which is grammatically neut. sg., though conceptually plural.</p>
<h3 id="i373">I.37.3</h3>
<p>The Pp. reads pl. káśāḥ ‘whips’ here, and standard tr. follow this, making it
the subj. of vádān. But káśā- is otherwise only sg. in the RV, even when plural
entities wield it. I therefore take it as sg. káśā and as the subj. of śṛṇve, with the
Maruts as unexpressed subj. of vádān. This also makes better sense of the positions
of both eṣām and yád: most tr. construe eṣām with hásteṣu, which means the
unaccented pronoun would begin a clause. And yád would be too far to the right in
its clause: we expect yá-forms to follow at most one constituent. (Of course, it might
be possible to interpret eṣām káśā hásteṣu “the whip in their hands” as a single
constituent, but this would be pushing it.)</p>
<h3 id="i375">I.37.5</h3>
<p>It is possible to take prá śaṃsā as 1st sg. subjunctive, as Re. does, though there
seems no compelling reason not to continue with a 2nd sg. impv., following the 2nd pl.
gāyata in the previous pāda (4c).
Pāda b seems an incipient izafe construction, with an appositive introduced by
yád &ndash; even though it is grammatically impeccable as a standard rel. cl. (allowing for
the attraction in gender to neut. yád of putative *yám, whose antecedent ághnyam is
masc.).
Ge unaccountably interprets the med. pf. vāvṛdhe as a 1st sg. (“Ich habe mich
… gestärkt”; so also WG), though he doesn’t read prá śaṃsā in a as 1st ps. Although
this is grammatically possible, context suggests that the Marut troop is the subj. of
this verb.</p>
<h3 id="i376">I.37.6</h3>
<p>Although nouns not in the vocative case generally lose their accent in
vocatival phrases (type sūno sahasaḥ “o son of strength”), the conjoined genitives
diváś ca gmáś ca retain their standard accent though being part of the voc. phrase
headed by dhūtayaḥ “o shakers” – presumably in part because the pāda needs to
begin with an accented word and also because this particular voc. phrase is not only
structurally complex (with a conjoined NP as gen.) but also not a fixed idiom. Of
course, since diváś ca gmáś ca opens the pāda, it would have to be accented one way
or other other, but if it had received default voc. accent we would expect dívaś ca
gmaś ca.</p>

<h3 id="i379">I.37.9</h3>
<p>The syntactic structure of this verse is not clear, in great part because it
contains no finite verbs, and most tr. leave the structure undefined. In my interpr.
51
pāda a is a causal clause dependent on the main clause of pāda b, with yát … śávaḥ in
the relative clause of pāda c coreferential with the váyaḥ of b. The point is that at the
point of birth, in a stable situation (a), the Maruts had the strength to leave their
mother’s womb on their own (nír √i is a lexeme specialized for birth contexts; cf.,
e.g., IV.18.2, V.78.9) (b), and that same strength remains with them (c).
I construe ánu with preceding sīm (“follows them”); cf. I.141.9.</p>
<h3 id="i3710">I.37.10</h3>
<p>The standard tr. separate pādas a and b and supply a verb with the former
(e.g., Ge “stimmen”) with no obvious source. I prefer to take the two pādas together
and take kā́ṣṭhāḥ as an unmarked simile: “their songs (like) race-course posts.” The
lexeme úd √tan then has the meaning ‘stretch upward, erect’; this is the only finite
form of the idiom in the RV (or, it seems, anywhere), which is mostly attested in the
frozen adjective uttāná- ‘stretching upward, stretching out’.
Why their knees are bent is a matter of speculation, but it probably refers to a
crouching position suitable for driving (cf. VIII.92.3).</p>
<h3 id="i3711">I.37.11</h3>
<p>Although most tr. take the “child of mist” to be the rain, its physical
description here (“long and wide”) makes better sense for a cloud.
ámṛdhra- normally means ‘not neglectful, not slighting’, but this doesn’t yield
much sense here. I therefore take it in the passive sense ‘not (to be) neglected /
slighted’; English “not negligible” provides a perfect idiomatic counterpart.</p>
<h3 id="i3713">I.37.13</h3>
<p>The mutual chatter of the Maruts on their journey refers of course to the
thunder.</p>

<h3 id="i3715">I.37.15</h3>
<p>This final verse is oddly disjointed. For one thing there must be a change of
person from 2nd (vaḥ) to 3rd (eṣām) in ab in reference to the Maruts; it is difficult not
to take these pl. pronouns as coreferential. I supply dúvaḥ in a, because this pāda is
structurally similar to 14b; however, this is not strictly necessary, and an
interpretation like Ge’s “Denn es gibt etwas für euch zum Schwelgen” is certainly
possible. As for pāda b, it is generally taken to mean “we are theirs,” and, again, this
is possible. But given its structural similarity to the immediately preceding pāda, I
interpret it in similar fashion, as suggesting that we have something to offer them.
The last pāda then expresses what our service to the Maruts should bring about for us.</p>
<h2 id="i38-maruts">I.38 Maruts</h2>
<h3 id="i381">I.38.1</h3>
<p>For kadhapriyaḥ see I.30.20. In this passage the connection of this voc. with
the interrogative is esp. clear, since the pāda begins kád dha “what indeed?” kád is
translated twice, for clarity.
52</p>
<h3 id="i382">I.38.2</h3>
<p>The gen./abl. form of diváḥ and pṛthivyā́ḥ is somewhat surprising, but, with
Old, it is best to assume they depend on kvà. Although the ná separating them is also
somewhat surprising, it is possible to take it as a real simile particle rather than a
bleached connective (Re’s “aussi bien que…”). Since the point of this tṛca is the
anxiety occasioned by the Maruts’ absence from our sacrifice, the poet worries that
the Maruts have disappeared to some other sacrificer on earth as definitively as if
they had gone off to heaven.
In the simile in c, “in a pasture” is supplied on the basis of the formula √RAN
gā́vo ná yávase (V.53.16, etc.). Note that the expected yávase shows up below in 5a,
in a slightly off-kilter simile. This might be taken as “poetic repair” (see Jamison
2006: Paris poetics), but simultaneously “de-repair,” in that it introduces an element
from one verbal complex into another, where it is unexpected.</p>
<h3 id="i385">I.38.5</h3>
<p>See remarks ad vs. 2 on the simile here.
The “path of Yama” is of course the path to death (or after death, to Yama’s
world). The prohibitive mā́of pāda a must have domain also over pāda c.</p>
<h3 id="i386">I.38.6</h3>
<p>durháṇā and related forms are most likely Middle Indic developments of
*durhṛ́ṇā (etc.) ‘evil rage’ from √hṛ ‘be angry’. See EWA s. HAR I

Ge (WG) take párāparā as representing pára+apara- ‘further and nearer,
earlier and later’, but Old’s interpr. (followed by Re) as an āmreḍita preposition
‘further and further, ever further’ is more appealing. As Re points out, the adv. párā
and related forms are characteristic of nírṛti-.</p>
<h3 id="i387">I.38.7</h3>
<p>The standard interpr. of avāta- here is ‘windless’, but with Gr (see also Lub) I
take it to the homonymous stem ‘unextinguishable, unquenchable’ (√vā ‘extinguish’).
The point here is that even in a waterless place the Maruts can make rain: wind is
irrelevant, but water that doesn’t give out is crucial. Cf. avánīr avātā́ḥ “unquenchable
streams” in I.62.10.</p>

a sg. form of reja- to be supplied), but an acc. extent-of-space interpretation works
just as well, without needing an extra verb. So also Re.
The last three verses (7–9) describing the thunderstorm are all couched in the
present tense, so the augmented imperfect árejanta is somewhat surprising. Vs. 10
does begin a new tṛca, however.</p>
<h3 id="i3811">I.38.11</h3>
<p>ródhas- is a bulwark or fortification (√rudh ‘obstruct’), in this context
indicating the ‘banks’ of a river, which keep the waters within.
53</p>
<h3 id="i3812">I.38.12</h3>
<p>The change of person between pādas, 2nd pl. vaḥ in a, 3rd pl. eṣām in b, is
exactly the same as in I.37.15 and equally inexplicable. I have therefore failed to tr.
eṣām. It is possible, of course, that eṣām doesn’t refer to the Maruts, but to part of the
listed equipage, perhaps the chariots – hence “Let your wheel-rims be steady, and
(your) chariots and their horses” – but the parallel structure in the previous hymn
makes that unlikely.</p>
<h3 id="i3813">I.38.13</h3>
<p>I have tr. jarā́yai as ‘to awaken him’, but this is probably wrong, however
appealing in context. The noun jarā́- only means ‘old age’, and therefore some
version of Ge’s “dass er das Greisenalter (uns schenke)” is better. Its intent would
match the last pāda of the previous hymn, I.37.15c “in order (for us) to live a full
lifetime,” and the two hymns have much in common.</p>
<h3 id="i3814">I.38.14</h3>
<p>The first two pādas contain two punning verbs, whose double meanings
reinforce each other: mimīhí can belong to √mā ‘bellow’ and √mā ‘measure’
(generally assigned only to the latter and so tr.). In the first meaning it refers to the
sound of the song, in the second to its regulated production, that is, to its meter.
tatanaḥ can belong to √tan ‘thunder’ and √tan ‘stretch out’ (Gr assigns to the former,
but standard tr. reflect the latter). In the first meaning it again refers to the sound of
the song, in the second, again to its method of production – in this case, the
prolonging of a tone or note. The second meanings of both verbs clearly belong to
the technical vocabulary of singing (see the next pāda, 14c, as well), the former
connect the poet’s sounds to those of the Maruts’ thunderstorm (cf. mimāti ‘bellows’
in 8a).</p>
<h3 id="i3815">I.38.15</h3>
<p>The two occurrences of tveṣá-, 7a and 15b, both referring to the Maruts,
should have been harmonized in tr. (currently ‘dazzling’ and ‘glittering’
respectively). A regrettable if minor lapse.</p>
<h2 id="i39-maruts">I.39 Maruts</h2>
<h3 id="i391">I.39.1</h3>
<p>mā́na- seems to activate the same pun on the homonymous roots √mā as was
noted in the preceding hymn, I.38.14. The Maruts project both their bellowing and
the measure of their song. (Standard tr. only recognize the ‘measure’ sense.)
“Like a flame” – what does śocíḥ correspond to in the frame of the passage?
Ge (/WG) take it as parallel to “you” (=Maruts), as the agent of throwing, and supply
an object “(ihren Schein).” But since śocís- is a neuter, it can as easily be an
accusative and express the thrown object, and this seems to me the more likely
interpretation (perhaps influenced by the modern flame-thrower). In a Marut context
it could stand for the lightning they deploy in addition to the thunder represented by
mā́nam. For further on this image see disc. at vs. 10.</p>
<h3 id="i392">I.39.2</h3>
<p>The two contrastive pādas of the first hemistich express offensive and
defensive procedures respectively.
54</p>
<h3 id="i393">I.39.3</h3>
<p>Standard treatments (including Old) divide pāda a into a rel. cl. and main
clause (e.g., Ge “Was fest ist, stosset ihr um”), accounting for the accent on hathá by
its placement immediately after the rel. cl. However, this interpr. requires taking yát
sthirám as an embedded relative, preceded by the preverb+part. associated with the
main verb (párā ha). Since RV does not (ordinarily) have embedded relatives, it is
best to take yád as the subordinator for the whole hemistich (with domain over
vartáyatha as well). This also makes the two pādas more parallel: Ge’s tr. of b as also
consisting of rel. cl. main cl. (“was schwer ist, bringet …”) is impossible.</p>
<h3 id="i394">I.39.4</h3>
<p>The opening of pāda c is identical to 2c. The rest of this hemistich presents a
few problems. The phrase tánā yujā́is rendered variously. My translation is based on
the observation that in almost every single instance yujā́follows an instr. in an
expression meaning “with X as yoke-mate” (X may either be animate [e.g., I.8.4
tváyā yujā́] or inanimate [e.g., X.83.3 tápasā yujā́“with fervor as yokemate”]). In
this case, I take the root noun tán- to refer to the Marut’s entire lineage, in other
words their family heritage and their sibling connections to each other. The instr.
phrase sárvayā viśā́“with your whole clan” in the next vs. (5d) may convey the same
meaning. Taking tánā as ‘lineage’ here also has the merit of allowing a semantic
connection with tánāya in 7a.
I separate the two pādas (so also Re), in great part because of the position of
nū́cid, which usually opens its clause (here after an extra-sentential voc. rúdrāsaḥ).
However, a tr. similar to Ge’s, “your might is never to be open to challenge,” would
also be possible.</p>
<h3 id="i395">I.39.5</h3>
<p>The two other occurrences of durmáda- ‘badly drunk’ (I.32.6, VIII.2.12) are
both in martial context and seem to refer to warriors intoxicated on the frenzy of
battle. The other occurrences are quite negative, whereas here we must take the word
as positive or neutral in describing the Maruts, who are, to be sure, frequently
depicted as being almost out of control. I think this is the point of comparison.</p>
<h3 id="i398">I.39.8</h3>
<p>The threatening ábhva- (&lt; privative á- + √bhū; cf. WG “Unwesen”) that
besets us represents the Vedic fear of formlessness. See my forthcoming “The Blob
in Ancient India.”</p>
<h3 id="i399">I.39.9</h3>
<p>The signature word of this final tṛca is ásāmi-, Ge’s “vollkommen”
“complete.” It literally means “without a half, not halved,” and the insistence on this
unusual form merits a literal translation, in my view, although it is less fluent than
the paraphrase.
káṇvaṃ dadá “you gave Kaṇva” &ndash; the grammar is clear, but the meaning
somewhat odd. What is presumably meant is the ancient poet Kaṇva, ancestral to the
current line.
55</p>
<h3 id="i3910">I.39.10</h3>
<p>This verse shows a type of ring composition with vs. 1, in sense though not
vocabulary. The hymn begins (1b) with a shooting/throwing metaphor, śocír ná
mā́nam ásyatha “(when) you cast your measure/bellowing like a flame.” The last
pāda of the hymn (10d) makes the shooting image more pointed: íṣuṃ ná sṛjata
dvíṣam “you launch your enmity like an arrow.” The “shooting” verb √as of 1b is
replaced by more generic √sṛj ‘launch, release’, but the simile specifies an arrow,
rather than the potentially destructive but less specific ‘flame’. The responsion
between these two expressions may give added support to the interpretation of śocíḥ
as an accusative in vs. 1; see discussion there.</p>
<h2 id="i40-brahmaṇaspati">I.40 Brahmaṇaspati</h2>
<h3 id="i403">I.40.3</h3>
<p>The sense of the hapax paṅktírādhas- ‘whose gifts come in fives’ is
unexplained. It may of course be some ritual reference (and the range of available
explanations tends in that direction), but I suggest that it might be a reference to the
fingers and mean that gifts come by the handful, that is, abundantly.</p>
<h3 id="i406">I.40.6</h3>
<p>The ca in c is subordinating, as the verbal accent shows (pratiháryathā). See
Klein: DGRV I.240.</p>
<h3 id="i407">I.40.7</h3>
<p>Although the standard tr. take antarvā́vat as referring to territory “in between”
(e.g., Ge “das dazwischen liegende (Land)”), I follow Schmidt’s (B+I, 102; see also
Old ad loc., AiG II.2.893) suggestion that it is a pleonastically marked variant of
antárvant- ‘pregnant’, an interpretation that works nicely with the following verse.
Although my translation implies that antarvā́vat modifies kṣáyam, this cannot be true
because kṣáya- is masc. My rendering is an abbreviated form of “made his dwelling
place into (something) pregnant” (cf. Schmidt “seinen Wohnsitz hat er zu etwas
gemacht, das … schwanger ist”).
Where I differ from Schmidt (and some others) is in the interpr. of pastyā̀bhiḥ
in pāda c. Opinion is split over whether this stem (and pastyà-) means ‘stream’ or
‘dwelling place’, and Schmidt goes with the former. Although that meaning works
well in this passage &ndash; Schmidt takes pāda d as meaning “pregnant (with streams),”
that is, well-watered &ndash; on balance the ‘dwelling place’ interpretation fits more
contexts better. (Curiously in the same work [B+I, p. 64] Schmidt renders pastyā̀nām
in VII.97.5 as “der Häuser.”) For disc. see EWA s.v. pastyà- (favoring ‘dwelling
place’ for pastyà- and, less strongly, for pastyā̀-) and Brereton (Ādityas, 94–96 n. 45).
For additional if indirect evidence for ‘dwelling place’ see comm. ad IX.97.18.</p>
<h3 id="i408">I.40.8</h3>
<p>Most tr. (including Schmidt) render pṛñcītá with the anodyne ‘increase’, but
úpa √pṛc is a sexual idiom (‘inseminate’ &lt; ‘engorge’; see, e.g., VI.28.8). The accent
on this verb probably results from its adjacency to accented hánti (on which see, HO
and JSK – reff.).
56
Note the gapping out of compound in the contrastive phrase mahādhané …
árbhe “when there is a large stake or a small,” where the independent loc. árbhe is
functionally parallel to the 1st compound member mahā-.</p>
<h2 id="i41-ādityas">I.41 Ādityas</h2>
<h3 id="i414">I.41.4</h3>
<p>The voc. ādityāsaḥ was omitted from the tr. “O Ādityas” should be added at
the end of the first line.</p>
<h3 id="i418">I.41.8</h3>
<p>The first two pādas have elicited a fair amount of discussion and disagreement.
The questions are these: 1) What is the nuance of práti √vac and, in particular, what
is the function of the accusative construed with it? 2) Are ghnántam, śápantam, and
devayántam parallel accusatives, or is there a dependency relationship among them?
Ge (/WG) take devayántam as the object of ghnántam and śápantam (Ge “der den
Gottergebenen schlägt oder flucht”), while Re (EVP V) and Old consider the three
accusatives parallel, with the first two given as negative examples, the third one as a
positive one. Although I think the latter view is correct, I do not follow these scholars
in their assessment of the function of the accusative with práti √vac: both take it as
the topic spoken about (as opposed to Ge and WG). However, though práti is rare
with vac (one other occurrence in the RV, VIII.100.5, non-diagnostic because it is
not construed with an accusative there), when that preverb appears with other verbs
of speaking (√vad, brū, ah), the complement identifies the person spoken to, not the
contents of the speech. I therefore take the clause to mean that “I” will not bother to
answer back to a man who behaves badly, either physically (ghnántam) or verbally
(śápantam), though I would to a godly man. The parenthetical “as if” could be
omitted here, as ET points out. With devayántam freed from its potential as object of
the first two participles, they can instead take vaḥ ‘you’ as their object (though
admittedly how a mortal can “smite” the Ādityas is a bit unclear).</p>
<h2 id="i42-pūṣan">I.42 Pūṣan</h2>
<h3 id="i421">I.42.1</h3>
<p>Note the regularly contrasting preverbs sám and ví opening the first two pādas.
Though Re and, judging from his tr., Ge take sákṣvā to √sac ‘accompany’,
following Gr., according to Narten (265 and n. 834, and already so in BR, Whitney’s
Roots, etc.) it belongs with √sah ‘conquer’. That prá √sah is fairly common in the
RV (including nominal compounds) while prá √sac occurs only once (X.27.19) may
support this root assignment. I am, however, disturbed by the position of the preverb
and its accompanying enclitic pronoun naḥ: the collocation looks like the start of a
new clause. I wonder if we don’t in fact have two imperative clauses here, the second
with a gapped ihi. Cf. VIII.17.9 índra préhi purás tvám. My translation “go forth …
to victory” reflects this possible interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="i423">I.42.3</h3>
<p>On huraś-cít- see comm. ad IX.98.11.
57</p>
<h3 id="i424">I.42.4</h3>
<p>tápuṣi- is attested only twice elsewhere, both times modifying hetí-, hence the
supplied ‘weapon’ here.
I.42.7-9: vidaḥ is formally an injunctive and therefore functionally multivalent.
Hoffmann (1967: 263) is not certain that it has modal value, though most tr. (Ge, Re,
WG) take it as an impv. (e.g., Ge “schaff hierfür Rat!”). The other question is
whether the krátu- that Pūṣan is to find is his own or meant for us (e.g., Re “procure
(nous)…”). I have chosen to take the injunctive not as an impv. but a future-oriented
indicative and to interpret the krátu- as Pūṣan’s, not ours – the point being that Pūṣan
will find the resolve at our sacrifice to fulfill the requests we make of him in the
imperatives. However, the other possibilities sketched above are not excluded, and at
least in IX.20.3 an imperatival value of vidaḥ is likely; see comm. ad loc. I therefore
put forth the alternative tr. “find resolve” for the refrain in this tṛca.</p>
<h3 id="i428">I.42.8</h3>
<p>My “with” tr. of pāda b obscures what I think the grammatical structure is.
Pace Gr and Old, on accentual grounds navajvārá- should not be a bahuvrīhi, but
rather a karmadhāraya ‘new suffering’. The question is what relationship its pāda
bears to the previous one. Re’s suppressed purpose clause (or so his supplied “qu’il
n’y ait” suggests) may be the best possibility syntactically. If we simply assume an
imperatival “let there not be …” (so Maurer, sim. WG “nicht (sei uns)…”), parallel
to pāda a, we should expect mā́, not ná as the negative. It may be, however, that
existential prohibitives (of the “let there not be” type) are blocked, because the root
√as ‘be’ does not build an aorist and also lacks injunctive present forms, although
functionally similar mā́bhūt does occur. I have not found a discussion of this issue in
Hoffmann 1967, but I may have missed it.</p>
<h3 id="i429">I.42.9</h3>
<p>Though most of the verbs represented in this catalogue of imperatives
normally take objects, the rhetorical point of this listing is the stark abruptness, and
the inclusion of an object (udáram ‘belly’) with the final verb lays particular stress
on this last desire expressed, to eat one’s fill.
I.43 Rudra and Soma</p>
<h3 id="i431">I.43.1</h3>
<p>Tr. of vocéma repeated for clarity.
I.43.2-3: It is striking that Aditi and her two most illustrious sons, Mitra and Varuṇa,
are depicted here as closely connected with Rudra. It is not entirely clear why,
though perhaps it is simply an attempt in this relentlessly upbeat hymn to associate
Rudra, who can be viewed ambivalently, with these powerful and positive figures.</p>
<h3 id="i434">I.43.4</h3>
<p>jálāṣa- is “of unclear meaning” (so EWA s.v.) and shows non-Indo-Aryan
phonology. In the RV it occurs twice independently and twice in this compound
jálāṣabheṣaja- (and one of its independent occurrences is adjacent to bheṣajá-),
58
always in association with Rudra. The translation ‘healing’ (see also Kuiper, Aryans
25-26, 46) therefore makes contextual sense, despite the lack of etymological support.</p>
<h3 id="i435">I.43.5</h3>
<p>A verse-length relative clause, which can be construed either with vs. 4 (so
Ge) or, by my preference, with vs. 6 (so also Re, WG). There is no strong evidence
either way, however.</p>
<h3 id="i436">I.43.6</h3>
<p>Global ref. to human kind as “men and women” is vanishingly rare in the RV.
I know only one other potential case, the identical dative phrase in VIII.77.8, though
it has a more restricted sense in that passage.</p>
<h3 id="i438">I.43.8</h3>
<p>Although juhuranta and related forms are assigned to the root √hṝ ‘be angry’
by Insler (1968: 219ff.), an assignment accepted by Mayrhofer (EWA s.v. HARI
) and
further developed by Kü (602–3), such a meaning simply doesn’t make sense in this
passage or in III.55.2, and so I take the form to √hvṛ ‘go crookedly, go amiss’. The
phonology is perfectly apt, with a zero-grade having vocalic u and consonantal r
before vowel, despite the metathesized zero-grade hru found in some forms.</p>
<h3 id="i439">I.43.9</h3>
<p>The construction of the various parts of this rhetorically ambitious verse is not
entirely clear, and various tr. make various choices. (In addition to the standard ones,
see Lüders [231–32] and Hoffmann [Injunk. 260].) I take amṛ́tasya as modifying te,
rather than construing it with prajā́ḥ (as, e.g., Ge does). I consider the two locatives,
párasmin dhā́man ṛtásya and nā́bhā, to be parallel and to express the two
geographically opposed places where Soma will be searching: highest heaven and the
navel of the earth (supplying pṛthivyā́ḥ with nā́bhā as often). The larger meaning of
this verse is addressed in the publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="i44-49">I.44-49</h3>

among these hymns, see Jesse Lundquist 2014 (25th UCLA IE Conf., Proceedings).</p>

<h3 id="i442">I.44.2</h3>
<p>sajū́s-, opening pāda c and here rendered ‘jointly’, is etymologically related to
júṣṭa- ‘enjoyable, delightful’, which opens the verse, and the poet clearly recognizes
the connection. A tr. “in joint enjoyment with…” seems too heavy, however.</p>
<h3 id="i443">I.44.3</h3>
<p>My interpretation of bhā́ṛjīka- I owe to Thieme (Unters. 40 n. 2; see EWA s.v.
ṛjīka-).
adhvaraśrī́-. Pace Gr, Old (SBE) Ge (/WG), I very much doubt that -śrī́- in
this compound (or others) has transitive value: ‘das Opferfest verschönend’. For
extensive disc. see Scar (545-46), who lays out a number of interpretive possibilities
but seems to lean towards the one I also favor. (So also Re.)
59
Related to the analysis of this compound is the interpretation of yajñā́nām
adhvara-. Ge (WG) take the former as dependent on the latter (clearest in WG “der
die Opferhandlungen der Opfer verschönt”), but I think it more likely that the two
nouns are parallel and depend on -śrī́-, one as an independent gen., one as 1st
compound member. So Re.; Scar adduces VIII.44.7 adhvarā́ṇām abhiśríyam, with an
independent gen. of adhvará-, which supports this analysis.</p>
<h3 id="i444">I.44.4</h3>
<p>The initial word of this verse, śréṣṭham is the superlative associated with śrī́-,
the last word of the previous verse. A translation “glory … / Most glorious…” would
have captured this connection.</p>
<h3 id="i446">I.44.6</h3>
<p>All standard tr. take suśáṃsa- in an active sense (e.g., Ge “der …Schönes
sagt”) with the singer the recipient of Agni’s good speech. Certainly when applied to
mortals, this has to be the sense, but when applied to gods I take the adj. in passive
sense ‘good to proclaim/laud’, with here the singer in the dat. (gṛṇaté) as the agent of
the praising.</p>
<h3 id="i447">I.44.7</h3>
<p>The very common epithet viśvávedas-, used especially of Agni, has a potential
double sense in all its occurrences: ‘possesing all possessions’ and ‘possessing all
knowledge’. In fact, although the latter is generally favored in standard RV
translations, the former may be the more stable sense, in that its 2nd member védas- is
widespread in the meaning ‘possession, property’, but not found as a simplex in the
meaning ‘knowledge’. The parallel formation jātávedas- (see above, vs. 4) has a
similar problem. Though generally rendered as ‘who has knowledge of the beings’ it
could as well mean ‘who has possession of the beings’. Since jātávedas- seems to
have become more opaque to its users than viśvávedas-, which does often (?)
participate in its context, in the publ. tr. we do not translate jātávedas-.</p>
<h3 id="i448">I.44.8</h3>
<p>Pāda a, with the list of gods in the accusative, is an expansion of devā́n in 7d.
Though b begins with a god’s name in the acc. (agním), this is to be construed with
the following pādas.</p>
<h3 id="i449">I.44.9</h3>
<p>As with vs. 4, the beginning of this verse connects with the final word of the
previous one: 8d … svadhvara ‘o you of good ceremony’ / 9a … adhvarā́ṇām ‘of the
ceremonies’.
svardṛ́ś- is a difficult word, with multiple interpretations. See Scar (pp. 234-
39) for discussion of the various possibilities, though his favored one (“das
Sonnenlicht sehend”) seems to me the less common, since the adj. generally modifies
gods. I generally take it as meaning ‘having the look/appearance of the sun’, that is
‘looking like the sun’, but occasionally as ‘having the sight of the sun’, that is,
‘seeing the sun’. Interpretations like Ge’s “deren Auge die Sonne ist” are unlikely
because dṛ́ś- is not ‘eye’. See Re (EVP XII.81). In this particular passage, it is
possible that ‘seeing the sun’ might also be appropriate, as anticipating the
description of Agni in the next vs. (10b) viśvádarśata- ‘visible to all’. In other words,
60
the gods in 9 “see the sun” and in 10 Agni, often homologized to the sun, is
something that everyone sees.
I.44.10, 12: In my opinion, purohitá-, though preserving its literal meaning ‘set in
front’, also already refers technically to a priestly office, the figure later known as
the Purohita. Agni is called purohitá- both because he is literally ‘set in front’, that is,
moved to the east to serve as the offering fire (later called the Āhavanīya), and
because he serves as priest. JPB, however, does not believe that the word has
developed this technical meaning in the RV. See esp. his 2004 “Bráhman, Brahmán,
and Sacrificer,” in Griffiths and Houben, eds., The Vedas: Texts, Language &amp; Ritual:
Proceedings of the Third International Vedic Workshop, Leiden 2002, 325-44.</p>
<h3 id="i4410">I.44.10</h3>
<p>As just noted, this verse also shares lexicon with the previous one: 9d X-dṛ́ś-,
10b X-darśata-.
“Rich in radiance” is a less clumsy alternative for a literal rendering of the
bahuvrīhi vibhā́-vasu- ‘whose goods are radiance’.</p>
<h3 id="i4411">I.44.11</h3>
<p>Another lexical reminiscence across verses: 10d mā́nuṣaḥ# ‘descendant of
Manu’ and 11c #manuṣvát ‘like Manu’. As with the other examples, it is the last
word of the previous verse that is matched in the next.</p>
<h3 id="i4412">I.44.12</h3>
<p>Again, lexical echo, though in this case it’s the next-to-last word of the
preceding verse: 11d dūtám / 12b dūtyàm.
Note the synaesthesia in the second hemistich, with the sounds of the river’s
waves compared to the flashing of fire. The gen. agnéḥ here is a common noun
referring to the substance fire, not to the god. Its parallelism with síndhoḥ, also pādainitial, helps ground this usage.
I.44.13-14: The emphasis on hearing in these verses is continued in the next hymn
(vss. 2–3, 5, 7).</p>
<h3 id="i4413">I.44.13</h3>
<p>váhni- is usually ‘conveyor’, but here the gods cannot be conveying Agni,
and the word seems to be quite loosely connected with the notion of conveyance. My
‘passengers’ is probably pushing it beyond where it should go.</p>
<h3 id="i4414">I.44.14</h3>
<p>The final pāda makes a little ring with 2c.</p>
<h2 id="i45-agni">I.45 Agni</h2>
<p>The theme of “hearing,” found also in the last two verses of I.44, is further
explored here, with its complement, the “call” that the gods should hear.</p>
<h3 id="i451">I.45.1</h3>
<p>My understanding of the structure of this verse is quite different from the
consensus, which takes yájā of 1c as a 2nd sg. imperative, addressed to Agni,
governing all the accusatives in the verse (“sacrifice to the Vasus …”). I instead take
61
yajā as 1st sg. subjunctive, governing only the accusatives of the 2nd hemistich, and
supply ā́vaha ‘bring here’ from 2d to govern those in the 1st hemistich. (This is
supported by the fact that tráyastriṃśatam ‘three and thirty’ in 2d is a virtual
shorthand for 1ab vásūn … rudrām̐ādityā́m̐utá, the three divisions of the gods,
adding up to 33).
Despite the extra machinery, I think my interpretation better accounts for the
contrast between the accusatives in ab and cd: the first set names the large generic
groups of gods expected to attend the sacrifice, brought by Agni. The accusatives in
the second set do not fit this category; in fact, their most likely referent is Agni
himself: svadhvará- ‘of good ceremony’ is primarily and characteristically applied to
Agni, including in the previous hymn (I.44.8, a hymn that insistently associates Agni
with the adhvará- in 2b, 3d, 9a; see also 4c of this hymn), and mánujāta- ‘born of
Manu’ cannot be applied to other gods, but is appropriate to Agni; see mā́nuṣa-
‘descendant of Manu’ in the previous hymn (10d) and also used elsewhere of Agni,
as well as passages like VII.2.3 &hellip; agním mánunā sámiddham “… Agni, kindled by
Manu.” It’s true that ghṛtaprúṣ- ‘ghee-sprinkling’ is not a particularly Agnian epithet,
though it could work if a passive interpretation of the root noun pruṣ- is allowed
(‘ghee-sprinkled’; cf. I.58.2), and that jána- is somewhat awkward as a designation
of Agni (see my uneasy ‘being’).
Still, the standard interpretation of the verse is more awkward: if the
accusatives in cd are held to refer to the gods (“the divine race”; see 10a daívyaṃ
jánam), they are described by adjectives that ill befit them; if Agni is held to be their
referent (as supported by the above arguments), then the verse calls upon Agni to
sacrifice to himself; if the accusatives refer to the human race, then the verse calls
upon Agni to sacrifice to humans, which is entirely contrary to the Vedic model of
sacrifice. By separating the two halves of the verse into different clauses and by
interpreting yájā as a 1st singular, I account for the different referent types of the two
sets of accusatives and avoid having Agni sacrifice to himself by providing another
agent for the verb in cd.</p>

object of bíbhrataḥ, parallel with havíḥ. This in some ways makes better sense,
62
though the word order weakly favors my tr. Old (SBE) also takes the phrase as the

<p>I tr. sudānavaḥ as “you of good drops,” rather than “of good gifts,” which is

position. But as a general descriptor of the gods in this verse it might be better as “of
good gifts.”

The pāda break favors taking bhū́ri with the verb, as most do (e.g., Ge “geben
sie sich viele Mühe”), but semantically it goes better with pāda a. Cf. expressions
like bhū́ri te vásu (I.81.2, 6, VIII.32.8), bhū́ri vā́mam (I.124.12, VI.71.4), and esp.

<h3 id="i483">I.48.3</h3>
<p>Most tr. take jīrā́as agentive with an objective genitive (e.g., Ge “die Wagen
in Bewegung setzend”), but I think this unlikely because it would be the only such
usage of jīrá-. (gó-jīra- in IX.110.3 is sometimes so interpreted [Ge ‘die Kühe
zutreibend’] but need not be.) Although not taking jīrā́as transitive leaves ráthānām
without any clear governing word, that seems preferable to claiming a unique value
for jīrá- in this passage. That Dawn may be “the lady of the chariots” is also
suggested by her hundred chariots in 7c.
The referent of yé in c and the affiliation of that rel. cl. are disputed. Ge takes
the rel. pronoun as referring to the ráthānām of b. This has the merit of associating
the rel. with an adjacent noun in the proper number and gender and keeping the
relative clause syntactically confined to the verse in which it appears. However, it
affords these chariots more agency and significance than I think they deserve. Instead,
the rel. cl. of cd seems to group more naturally with the identically structured yé
clause in 4ab, which also has a 3rd pl. presential reflexive verb preceded by a loc. pl.
and also contains a genitive referrring to Dawn. The two clauses also begin with a
metrically irregular 11-syllable pāda with a rest right before the caesura, an
irregularity that also speaks for their association. This pair of relative clauses is
resolved by the main clause in 4cd. Such an enjambed structure is characteristic of
pragāthas. (Re also take the two verses this way.)
63
Then there is the question of the meaning of dadhriré. It belongs to the root
√dhṛ ‘hold, support’, and in this (rare) middle usage seems to have reflexive value
‘hold oneself’/‘hold oneself fast’, with the possible pregnant sense ‘hold oneself
ready’ (so Re, WG, Ge n.). I take it as having slightly different meanings in simile
and frame (a favored poetic strategy of Vedic bards). In the simile it depicts sailors
(or some sort of boatsmen) standing firm against the rigors of the voyage, whereas in
the frame the subjects (who are identified in the parallel rel. clause of 4ab as patrons)
hold themselves ready to give, an action that is also the topic of that parallel rel.
clause. In fact, one could almost construe (or supply) the dānā́ya of 4b with dadhriré
as well as with its own clause.</p>
<h3 id="i484">I.48.4</h3>
<p>This verse is somewhat oddly constructed, especially the distribution of
elements in cd. The opening of c, átrā́ha tád, seems overburdened with functionless
elements, esp. the tád, which has no obvious referent. As it turns out, this opening is
found elsewhere (I.135.8, 154.6), with a likewise referent-less tád. I therefore assume
that the tád here emphasizes the temporal/logical átra. Then we find two gen. plurals,
eṣām and nṝṇā́m, separated from each other, but probably ultimately coreferential. I
assume that enclitic eṣām serves as the correlative for yé in pāda a (though we might
expect téṣām) and that the unusually heavy opening of the pāda has bumped it into
pseudo-second position after the first real word of the clause, káṇvaḥ. But until we
understand more about the interaction of the placement of these various elements,
this is simply an after-the-fact description. It should be noted that eṣām generally
does not show the standard Wackernagel’s Position behavior (modified 2nd position)
that we might expect from an enclitic, and in particular has a tendency to take final
position. The nṝṇā́m at the end of the verse simply doubles and further specifies eṣām.
I have tr. nā́ma twice, for ease of English.</p>
<h3 id="i486">I.48.6</h3>
<p>The first pāda depicts the usual effect of Dawn – sending all creatures on
their daily business.
ódatī: Though this form appears to be a fem. pres. participle to a Class I
present (also in its other occurrence VIII.69.2), such an analysis is formally
troublesome, because the feminine stem is weak (-at-ī), though a strong suffix is
expected in Class I (e.g., bhávantī-). Moreover, there are no other forms to the
putative present *ódati; the standard present is nasal-infix unátti with transitive value.
And ódatī- lacks participial sense: it simply means ‘wet’. It thus seems best to take it
as a non-participial -ant- adjective (as járant- is often interpreted). It is worth noting
that Whitney (Roots) classifies it as a primary derivative of the root and gives no
Class I present and that Gotō makes no mention of it in his monograph on Class I; it
is likewise undiscussed in Lowe’s monograph on RVic participles.
As for its meaning here, it is used simultaneously in two senses: the literal one,
‘wet’, referring to the dew characteristic of early morning, and ‘lubricious’, referring
to Dawn’s notorious hyperfeminine and sexual qualities, also reflected in 5ab yóṣeva
… prabhuñjatī́“giving delight like a maiden.”
64
vājínīvant- (also vājínī-vasu-). This fairly common adjective is obviously a
derivative of extremely well-attested vājín- ‘prize-winning (horse)’, itself a
possessive adjective formed to vā́ja- ‘prize’. The usual tr. of vājínīvant- are rather
attenuated — Gr ‘gabenreich’, Ge (here) ‘du Reichbelohnende’, Debrunner (AiG II.2.
875) ’gabenreich’ — or render it as if it were identical to vā́ja-vant-; so Re. (here)
‘porteuse des prix de victoire’, WG ‘du Rennpreisbesitzende’. By contrast, I feel that
both the apparent feminine vājínī and the second possessive suffix (-vant- in addition
to -in-) should be noted and I interpret the stem as meaning ‘possessing prizewinning mares’. vājínīvant- is esp. characteristic of Dawn and other female figures
(e.g., Sarasvatī), who might be expected to have female animals; though vāj́inī-vasuis almost entirely confined to the Aśvins, those gods are very closely associated with
Dawn. Debrunner (AiG II.2.409) instead ascribes the -ī- to “Erweiterung durch -īnach Analogie anderer Wörter,” but doesn’t in this case suggest what other word(s)
might be involved.</p>
<h3 id="i489">I.48.9</h3>
<p>The standard tr. take the injunctive uchat as a modal (Ge “soll … hinweg
leuchten”), but since this verb is parallel to a presential perfect nānāma (so Kü 278-
79, pace WG “hat sich … gebeut”) and a pres. indic. kṛṇoti, I see no reason to ascribe
modal value to uchat.</p>
<h3 id="i4810">I.48.10</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. “with your lofty chariot … heed our call” implies that the
chariot is the instrument of her hearing. This was not the intent: the chariot is simply
one of her attributes.</p>
<h3 id="i4811">I.48.11</h3>
<p>sukṛ́taḥ is multiply ambiguous. Though it literally means ‘doing/performing
well’ / ‘of good action’, it is ordinarily specialized for performing the sacrifice well
and refers to the human actors in the ritual. However, it can also on occasion be used
of gods (e.g., X.63.9). In this passage most tr. take it as a gen. sg. referring to the
sacrificer and dependent on adhvarā́n (e.g., Ge “zu den Opfern des Frommen”).
However, this leaves ā́vaha without an object. I therefore read sukṛ́taḥ as acc. pl.,
and in fact I read it so twice — once as obj. of ā́vaha and referring to gods (so also
Gr) and once as the goal of ā́vaha and referring to the mortal sacrificers. The first
reading seems confirmed by the first pāda of the next verse, 12a, which “repairs” the
less clear expression with víśvān devā́m̐ā́vaha, using the same verb. The second
reading, referring to the sacrificers, allows the yé of 11d to have an antecedent of the
right grammatical number. It would of course be possible to take sukṛ́taḥ only once,
as referring to the gods, assuming the gapping of a pronominal antecedent to yé, but
this loses the neat equation of gods and sacrificers.</p>
<h3 id="i4814">I.48.14</h3>
<p>The relative clause of ab (lit. “which previous seers …” yé … ṛ́ṣayaḥ
pū́rve…) has no explicit referent in the main clause, but implicit is the notion that our
praises should receive the same favorable response from Dawn as theirs did, so there
is a suppressed gen. pl. téṣām or the like. The other passage containing the 3rd pl. mid.
pf. juhūré (VIII.8.6) is constructed almost identically to this one, though in dimeter
65
meter, with a similar implicit understanding of the relation between subordinate cl.
and main cl.</p>
<h2 id="i49-dawn">I.49 Dawn</h2>
<p>On this hymn and, especially, on its “versified sandhi paradigm” (in JL’s
felicitous phrase) and the aberrant voc. uṣar (4c), see Lundquist 2014. The
appearance of this entirely anomalous form in the final verse of Praskaṇva’s Dawn
ritual series (I.44-49) defines this series as a type of ring: uṣar- as an -ar locatival
occurred in the first verse of the series (I.44.1) in the compound uṣar-budh- ‘waking
at dawn’.
The hymn itself has a simple ring structure: bhadrébhiḥ in 1a (with which
‘rays’ is supplied on the basis of I.48.13) matches ráśmibhiḥ in 4a, rocanā́t in 1b
matches rocanám in 4b, while the genitive diváḥ of 1b anticipated in 3d.</p>

<h3 id="i503">I.50.3</h3>
<p>I separate pādas a and b and supply a verb of extension with b. Most tr. take
ádṛśram as the main verb of the whole verse. Although my interpretation requires
more machinery, it takes account of the fact that ví is vanishingly rare with the root
√dṛś (though it must be admitted that there’s an example in the nearby Praskaṇva
hymn I.46.11), while it is common with roots like √tan ‘stretch’, which also appears
regularly with raśmí-. Cf. X.129.5 vítato raśmíḥ. However, the standard tr. is
certainly possible. ET also suggests that since ví is fairly common with √bhrāj, that
might be the verb to understand with bc: “… his rays flashing widely through the
peoples like fires.” Of course, ordinarily participles with preverbs are univerbated,
but not always.</p>
<h3 id="i504">I.50.4</h3>
<p>I don&rsquo;t understand Ge’s “pünktlich” for taráṇiḥ, which does not seem to
reflect any of the possible meanings of √tṝ ‘cross over, surpass, etc.’. Here the idea is
clearly that the Sun crosses the sky.</p>
<h3 id="i506">I.50.6</h3>
<p>The first mention of any divine being but the Sun. The question here is
whether we have two additional gods or one. The two vocatives pāvaka and varuṇa
are in two different pādas (a, c), and the former is almost exclusively used elsewhere
of Agni. However, already in the hymn (vs. 1) another standard epithet of Agni,
jātávedas-, has been applied to a different god (Sūrya), and so it may be that aspects
of Agni, an alter ego of the Sun in some sense, are being distributed to other gods in
66
this hymn. Moreover, the sun is regularly considered Varuṇa’s eye, but not, I think,
Agni’s. Re, however, takes pāvaka as Agni.
The other question is the identity of the “bustling one” (bhuraṇyánt-). The
root √bhur and its derivatives are sometimes used of Agni and this referent is
possible here, but I think it more likely that it refers to the human ritualist, who is
active at the dawn sacrifice.
I.50.8–9: I assume that the seven mares of vs. 8 are the same as the sleek daughters
(śundhyúvaḥ … naptyàḥ) (or granddaughters) of the chariot, but I do not know why
the rare word naptī́- is used of them. Thieme (KlSch: 220), on the basis of
śundhyúvaḥ, thinks they are wild geese (“…hat sich sieben Wildgänse als Tochter
des Wagens angeschirrt”), but this seems to introduce an unnecessary complication
since śundhyú- can be taken in its literal meaning.</p>
<h3 id="i508">I.50.8</h3>
<p>The reassignment of Agni epithets continues in this verse: śocíṣkeśa- ‘flamehaired’ is otherwise only of Agni.</p>
<h3 id="i509">I.50.9</h3>
<p>sū́raḥ: Although most take this as nom. sg. (Gr, Ge, Th, Lü), Re makes a good
case for it as gen. sg. (followed, it seems, by WG), also adducing V.31.11 sū́raś cid
rátham.</p>
<h3 id="i5012">I.50.12</h3>
<p>ET comments “1.50.12 is AVS 1.22.4, AVP 1.28.4, the final verse of 4-verse
compositions for getting rid of jaundice. However, it&rsquo;s interesting that in both AV
recensions the first verse refers to the sun, but it&rsquo;s not the same as RV 1.50.11. The RV
seems to have a tṛca which incorporates the verse that appears as 1.50.12 whereas AV
tacks it on to a different tṛca. On the other hand, the 1st pl verb forms are jarring
in RV 1.50.12, but in the AV they harmonise with other 1st pls.” This formal and
structural argument suggests that the verse was taken over from Atharvan context, a
possibility that its contents also support.</p>
<h2 id="i51-indra">I.51 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="i512">I.51.2</h3>
<p>This verse displays a type of “poetic repair”: the first hemistich has a
grammatical subject that is ordinarily inanimate (ūtáyaḥ ‘[forms of] help’) with a
verb that ought to have a personal subject (abhí .. avanvan ‘they attained to / gained’),
with an object possessing a number of qualities, but unnamed; the third pāda solves
this slight puzzle by giving names to both: the subject is the Ṛbhus, the object Indra.
The spatial contrast in b between filling the midpace, but being himself
enclosed by his own powers (muscle-bound?) is nice.
jávana- occurs only here in the RV, but the -ana-suffix ordinarily makes
transitive nominals (pace Ge’s “raschhandeln,” Re’s “véloce”).</p>
<h3 id="i513">I.51.3</h3>
<p>Though the verse starts promisingly, with two identifiable myths (Vala, pāda
a; Atri, pāda b &ndash; though the 100-doored [house] is not otherwise known), the second
hemistich brings obscurity. As noted in the intro., the standard myth about Vimada
67
involves the Aśvins bringing him a wife, usually with the verb (ní) √vah. Is this the
same story, with vásu ‘good thing’ a generic substitution for ‘wife’, or is Indra’s
relationship with Vimada of a different sort from the Aśvins’? As for pāda d, the
action here is completely obscure (see Ge’s somewhat desperate note attempting to
make this about a rocky nest [Felsennest] of robbers), and what it has to do with the
Vimada story is equally obscure. Since nartáyan in d is only a participle, it should be
attached to the main clause in c rather than relating a separate myth. A final bit of
obscurity is saséna ‘with grain’, which opens c. The stem sasá- generally shows up
in enigmatic phrases referring, probably, to the ritual grass and/or the cereal ritual
oblations.</p>
<h3 id="i514">I.51.4</h3>
<p>This verse, by contrast, clearly concerns the Vṛtra myth and is for the most
part unchallenging. It is worth noting that its first pāda is structured almost exactly
like 3a and begins and ends identically: tvám … (a)vṛṇor ápa. The verse also
contains an occurrence of vásu (in b), which unfortunately doesn’t shed any light on
the mysterious vásu in 3c. In fact 4b is the only part of this verse that is somewhat
unclear: the dā́numad vásu (‘drop-laden goods’, taking dā́nu to ‘drop’ with Gr and
Re, rather than ‘gift’ with Ge [/WG]) is of course the water confined in the mountain
by Vṛtra, which Indra releases. But why does Indra hold it fast (ádhārayaḥ) in the
mountain rather than releasing it as usual? The passage is similar to the Indra
ātmastuti X.49.9 aháṃ saptá sraváto dhārayaṃ vṛ́ṣā. Perhaps he gave the waters, as
it were, emotional support – but this doesn&rsquo;t sound like either the Rigveda or Indra.
At best we’re left with an attenuated meaning like “help out.” Or — a long shot —
this is an expression like I.103.7 sasántaṃ … abodhayó ‘him “you ‘awakened’ the
sleeping serpent,” where abodhayaḥ is meant to evoke its opposite, ‘put to sleep’.
See intro. to that hymn and Jamison 1982/83. In that case ‘hold fast’ would evoke ‘let
go’. For a possibly similar passage with Indra “bringing to rest” the waters rather
than releasing them, see V.32.1 and comm. thereto. However, the formulaic nexus
between √budh ‘awake’ and √sas / svap ‘sleep’ is very strong, whereas √dhṛ is not
regularly paired with, say, forms of √sṛj ‘release’, and so I advance this possibility
only very tentatively. ET offers another intriguing suggestion. She cites the wellknown Old Persian PN Dāraya-vahu (corresponding phonologically to Skt.
*dhāráya- + vásu, and wonders “Could the poet be deliberately using, perhaps even
punning on, an inherited Indo-Iranian collocation of the verb *dhṛ with object *vásu?”</p>

<p>Note alliteration: … pipror … prā́rujaḥ púraḥ, prá …</p>
<h3 id="i516">I.51.6</h3>
<p>JL cleverly suggests that the verse contains a word play on the PN of Indra’s
defeated opponent Arbuda: by characterizing him as ‘great’ (mahā́nt-), the poet
implicitly evokes the semantic opposite árbha-, arbhaká-, which resembles the PN
phonologically and would help regularize the non-IndoAryan -b- in arbudá. So, “you
trampled down Arbuda (the little one), though he was great.” As JL points out,
support for this interpretation comes from 13a ádadā árbhām mahaté …, kakṣī́vate
vṛcayā́m … “You gave little Vṛcayā to great Kakṣīvant.

<h3 id="i517">I.51.7</h3>
<p>The phrasing of pāda b is conceptually backwards, strikingly so. Ordinarily
Indra drinks the soma and is moved to be generous, whereas here his (latent)
generosity rouses itself in anticipation of the soma.
víśvāni carelessly omitted in publ. tr.: “all the bullish strengths.”
More alliteration: vṛścā́śátror áva víśvāni vṛ́ṣnyā, with sequences of v with
either i or ṛ, followed by ś or ṣ (with a few more v’s and a ś thrown in).</p>
<h3 id="i519">I.51.9</h3>
<p>The avratá- ‘having no commandment’ of 8b is transformed into the even less
savory ápavrata- ‘against/rejecting commandments’ and contrasted with their
opposite number, the ánuvrata- ‘following commandments’.
The image of Indra’s transformation into an ant (vamrá-) presumably
concerns his ability to pass unnoticed in the enemy camp and then bring the
fortifications down from within. However, “smashing apart” (ví √han) doesn&rsquo;t seem
a likely action for an ant, or even a huge nest of ants, so the combined image is
somewhat unsettled.
The identity of the enemy in this hemistich is not clear. The other occurrence
of the phrase dyā́m ínakṣant- (X.45.7) refers to Agni, but that identification seems
unlikely here. It should also be noted that the other genitive phrase referring to this
enemy, vṛddhásya cid várdhataḥ “the one who, though already full grown, kept
growing,” is grammatically problematic because the active present participle
várdhant- should be transitive, as the rest of this extremely well-attested active
inflection is. Gotō (1987: 291) notes the problem but has no explanation either.
Expected middle *várdhamānasya would of course not fit this metrical position, but
that is not enough for a Rigvedic poet to contravene grammar. However, the active
part. more nearly matches the paired ppl. phonologically: vṛddha… vardha…, and
this may have influenced the poet to use the active form.</p>
<h3 id="i5110">I.51.10</h3>
<p>A nice adjacency figure, nṛmaṇo manoyujaḥ.
Ge (/WG) supplies “with strength” with pū́ryamānam ‘being filled’, but Re’s
“with soma” (an alternative allowed by Ge in his n.) seems more likely on the basis
of other “fill” phrases involving Indra. Esp. apposite is V.34.2, adduced by Ge,
where Indra fills his belly with soma while Uśanā offers him a weapon, much as here.
Indra’s exhilaration in the immediately following verse here (11a) also supports the
soma interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="i5111">I.51.11</h3>
<p>vaṅkū́vaṅkutárā is generally taken as characterizing the speed of the two
horses, and I agree that that is the general idea &ndash; but think this meaning arises
indirectly. Ge takes it as ‘flying’, Re as ‘rapid’, Hoffmann (Inj. 221) ‘ever faster
moving’, WG ‘ever faster galloping’, but this basic meaning does not fit the root to
which it most likely belongs, √vañc ‘move crookedly’, or the other occurrences of
vaṅkú-, esp. I.114.4. I think the nuance here is the same one found in the deriv. adj.
vákva(n)- ‘billowing’ à ‘surging’. The non-linear movement of the root is here
69
concretized as a wave motion, with the attendant speed and power associated with
waves.
The c pāda presents some difficulties of construction, particularly the two
accusatives yayím and apáḥ, which do not match in number. Ge and Re supply
‘mounts’ (ádhi tiṣṭhati) from the end of pāda b (or perhaps ā́… tiṣṭhasi from 12a)
and ‘chariot’ with yayím and begin a new clause with nír. So, “the powerful one
(mounted) the speeding (chariot); he released the water in a stream.” Alternatively
Ge suggests that c is a single clause, but that apáḥ is not an acc. pl., as is usual, but
the rare gen. sg. construed with srótasā, so “the powerful one released the speeding
(chariot) with the water’s stream(speed) [mit des Wassers Strom(schnelle)].” Neither
of these fussy solutions is appealing. With regard to the latter, nir apáḥ [acc.pl.] √sṛj
appears to be formulaic (cf. I.103.2, X.124.7, the only other examples of níḥ √sṛj that
I know of), and so a gen. sg. is unlikely; with regard to the former, it seems overly
elaborate to supply so much material in a pāda that can be read as a unity. I follow
Old in taking yayím as an epithet of (so Old) or, better, an appositive or qualifier to
the waters. Since áp- ‘water(s)’ is in essence a plurale tantum, a parallel singular
would not be surprising. For yayí/ī́- qualifying waters, cf. X.78.7 síndhavo ná
yayíyaḥ “coursing like rivers,” adduced by Old (also X.92.5). My tr. “for coursing”
rather than “as coursing” or the like is a concession to English.</p>
<h3 id="i5112">I.51.12</h3>
<p>Another verse with tricky constructions. In the first pāda the loc. vṛṣapā́ṇesu
goes misleadingly easily into English (“you mount the chariot to…” like “the bus to
town”). Despite my tr. I think it more likely that vṛṣapā́ṇesu is functionally a loc.
absolute of the type “when bullish drinks (are available)” à “on the occasion of
bullish drinks / when there are bullish drinks.”
In pāda b most tr. (Gr, Ge, Re, WG) take prábhṛtā as representing -āḥ out of
sandhi – following the Pp., hence a nom. pl. m. past participle – but as Old points out,
this is very disruptive to the syntax. Better, with Old, to interpret it as a loc. sg. to the
-i-stem prábhṛti- ‘presentation’, a possibility suggested by Pischel (see Old) and
mentioned by Ge in his n.
Pāda c is standardly taken as preposed to d and the verb is tr. as indicative
(e.g., Ge “du … deine Freude hast,” Re “tu prends plaisir”), but cākánaḥ is
undeniably subjunctive; yáthā + subjunctive regularly builds purpose clauses, which
are regularly postposed. I therefore take pāda c with ab: the purpose of Indra’s
mounting of the chariot is the pleasure he will receive at the soma sacrifice.
In d all tr. take ślókam as ‘fame’, but the noun refers rather to a very
perceptible noise or call that signals some event. The event is often the sacrifice and
the ślóka-, the noise, is often issued by the pressing stones (e.g., I.113.3, 139.10,
III.53.10); the noise of the ślóka- is loud enough to reach to heaven (e.g., I.83.6,
190.4). This pāda contains this same notion of the ślóka-, the audible signal of the
sacrifice, going to heaven, but it seems also, oddly, to suggest that Indra follows it
there. Perhaps this refers to Indra’s departure to heaven at the end of the sacrifice, a
common theme.

<h3 id="i5113">I.51.13</h3>
<p>Indra’s transformation into a human female is no more surprising than his
changing into an ant in vs. 9, and is better supported. See Ge’s note, as well as my
1991 Hyenas, where in a widespread story in Vedic prose Indra is transformed into a
female hyena.</p>
<h3 id="i5114">I.51.14</h3>
<p>The standard tr. take pāda b as a nominal sentence (“the praise song is a
doorpost”), but the verb of pāda a, aśrāyi ‘has been fixed, propped’, fits b very nicely,
as Old argues. Ge suggests such an interpretation in his notes, without rendering it in
tr.
The poet Kakṣīvant mentioned in vs. 13 is associated with the Pajras, who are
mentioned a number of times in the hymns attributed to Kakṣīvant. ET points out that
pāda b probably contains a pun on the PN pajrá-, which literally means ‘sturdy,
steadfast’, a meaning which works well with the fixed doorpost.
I take prayantā́in d as a periphrastic future, not a straight agent noun.</p>
<h2 id="i52-indra">I.52 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="i521">I.52.1</h3>
<p>The verb mahayā can either be a 2nd sg. imperative (so Ge [/WG]) or a 1st sg.
subjunctive (so Re). In favor of the former interpretation is the parallel initial verse
of the last hymn, I.51.1. abhí tyám meṣám &hellip; madatā, with imperative (2nd pl.); in
favor of the latter is the other main verb in this verse, 1st sg. opt. vavṛtyām. Either is
possible; I weakly favor the 1st ps. subjunctive.
Since subhū́- ‘of good essence’ is adjectival, a noun should be supplied as the
subject of pāda b (pace Ge, who simply tr. “Kräfte”). The likely solution is found in
vs. 4 subhvàḥ svā́abhíṣtayaḥ “his own superior powers of good essence,” and I have
supplied abhíṣtayaḥ here. (So also, it seems, WG.)
The standard tr. take cd as a single clause, with the acc. índram of d identified
with the rátham of c. Although this is not impossible, turning the literal chariot of a
god towards the sacrifice is a common practice in the RV, just as turning the god
himself is, and an equation of Indra and the chariot is somewhat awkward. I therefore
think we have two separate clauses, with ā́… vavṛtyām applicable to both.
The c pāda has, in my interpretation, a non-insistent but appealing syntactic
play, with the compound havana-syád- “rushing to the summons” parallel to the
simile átyaṃ ná vā́jam “like a steed (rushing to) the prize” — the suppressed term
being a form of the root √syand and the accusative vā́jam matching the first
compound member havana-.</p>
<h3 id="i523">I.52.3</h3>
<p>A challenging verse, describing Indra in unusual ways and deploying unusual
words and constructions.
The first pāda contains the difficult but clearly related words dvaró dvaríṣu,
which seem also to belong with vṛ̥́ka-dvaras- (II.30.8) ‘having the X of a wolf’.
Wackernagel (1918 [see details in EWA s.v. dvará-] = KlSch 325-26) adduces the
Avestan root duuar, which expresses a daevic way of moving. If vṛ̥́ka-dvaras- means
71
‘having the movement/gait of a wolf’, I tr. the words in this passage as ‘skulking,
skulker’, as characteristic of a wolf.
The rest of the first pāda consists of vavrá ū́dhani. The latter is clearly a
locative, but the former is taken by the Pp. as vavráḥ, nom. sg. of vavrá- ‘cave,
cavity’ out of sandhi, an interpretation followed by the standard tr. and argued for by
Old. (Gr, however, takes it as a 3rd sg. pf. to √vṛ ‘cover’, vavré.) The sense is taken to
be “a cavity at the (soma) udder”; that is, Indra’s mouth, throat, and stomach are an
enormous empty space to be filled with soma. By contrast I take it as a loc. to the
same noun vavrá- and a simultaneous reference to the Vṛtra myth and the Vala myth,
as well as fitting the image conjured up by the dvar-words. To start with the last,
caves are good places to skulk and quite possibly a haunt of wolves. As for the Vṛtra
myth, Vṛtra himself is called a vavrá- in V.32.8, while Vala is itself a cave and the
word vavré is several times used of this myth and Indra’s involvement in it (IV.1.13,
V.31.3). Thus Indra is “skulking” in the vicinity of these mythological enemies in the
first part of this verse. The published tr. limits the reference of vavré to the Vṛtra
myth; I would now expand that.
I then take the adjacent loc. ū́dhani as contrastive and construe it with pāda b:
Indra skulks near his enemies (the “cavities”), but at the (soma-)udder he becomes
roused to elation and display his golden foundation, that is, the riches he will
dispense in return for the soma. Indra’s bright budhná- here contrasts with the
budhná- associated with Vṛtra in vs. 6, where the latter lies on the budhná- “of the
dusky realm” (rájasaḥ).
The last part of the last pāda, sá hí páprir ándhasaḥ, is also problematic. It is
universally interpreted as “he is filled / fills himself with soma,” which makes good
sense. Unfortunately it does violence to the grammar. First, pápri- does not
otherwise mean ‘filling’ (in my opinion, but see, e.g., Grestenberger, JAOS 133.2:
271, though she does not give exx.), but either ‘providing’ or ‘delivering’.
Furthermore, reduplicated -i-nominals are otherwise agentive (AiG II.2.291-93) and
regularly take accusatives (see esp. VI.50.13 dā́nu pápriḥ ‘supplying gifts’)(see
Grestenberger JAOS 133.2). Ge is aware of the morphological problem (though not,
it seems, the semantic one) and in his n. suggests that the form is either reflexive or
that jaṭháram ‘belly’ should be supplied, but there is no basis for either of these
solutions. Therefore, although I see the attractions of “is filled with soma,” I do not
see a way to wrest this meaning out of the text. Instead I take ándhasaḥ as a causal
ablative and pápriḥ in the same fashion as VI.50.13. The clause then paraphrases
pāda b: Indra provides wealth because he becomes exhilarated on soma.</p>
<h3 id="i524">I.52.4</h3>
<p>It is not clear to me why Indra’s superior powers have barhis as their heavenly
seat, but this does not license the grammatically impossible tr. of Ge and Re, who
seemingly take sádmabarhiṣaḥ as modifying índram.
For avātá- see comm. ad I.38.7 and VIII.79.7.</p>
<h3 id="i525">I.52.5</h3>
<p>svávṛṣṭi- is found only here (and 14c below, in the same phrase), and the
etymological identity of vṛṣṭi- is not clear. Easiest (with Gr) would be to take the
72
second member as vṛṣṭí- ‘rain’, but ‘having his own rain’ doesn’t make much sense.
Ge (n. to 14bc) connects it with várṣman- ‘height’, várṣiṣṭha- ‘highest’, vṛ́ṣan- ‘bull’,
tacitly positing a root √vṛṣ ‘be high/great’ and tr. ‘Eigengrösse’. One of the
difficulties with this interpretation is that the word should be a bahuvrīhi (so Old) not
a karmadhāraya, judging from parallel formations (cf. svá-yukti, svá-vṛkti [pace Gr,
Old]). I prefer the interpretation that links the word to the IE root *uer̯ ǵ ‘work’,
found in Aves. varəz (and of course Engl. work, Grk. ἔργον)(see EWA s.v. svávṛṣṭi-).
So, evidently, Re: “son action propre,” though Re also takes it as a karmadhāraya.
Because of the formal parallels, I interpret it as a bahuvrīhi ‘having his own work’,
even though this causes some problems: in this clause Indra must be referred to both
in accusative, in this compound, and in the genitive, in the phrase asya yúdhyataḥ,
which depends on máde. Nonetheless, as usual I don’t feel we can ignore grammar
whenever it complicates interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="i526">I.52.6</h3>
<p>durgṛ́bhiśvan- clearly belongs with durgṛ́bhi-, but the -śvan- is curious.
Probably best to explain it, with Scar (116) as a Kunstbildung based on ṛjíśvan- and
possibly mātaríśvan-. For this reason I’ve translated it as a nickname.</p>
<h3 id="i527">I.52.7</h3>
<p>I take yújyam as having gerundive force, construed with te, rather than simply
‘his own’ &lt; ‘associated (with himself)’ of other tr.</p>
<h3 id="i529">I.52.9</h3>
<p>Another puzzling verse, and my interpretation is accordingly not at all certain.
I take the first pāda, couched in the neuter, to refer to the sun (n. svàr-), the placing
of which in heaven (as m. sū́ryam) was Indra’s last act in vs. 7. In the 2nd pāda the
subjects of ákṛṇvata (note the middle, which should have self-beneficial force) make
this sun into their own means of getting to heaven. As an -ana-nominal, róhana-
(only here) should have transitive-causative force.
However, I think there is more going on here, for in the 2nd hemistich Indra is
identified as the sun (n. svàr), while his helpers, the Maruts, are associated with
humans, the descendents of Manu (mā́nuṣa-), and their activities. If Indra is the sun,
then the sun of pāda a, which the Maruts/gods used to get themselves to heaven in
pāda b, may well be Indra. For this identification note the -(ś)candra- reminiscent of
Indra’s candra- in 3b, and in 6a the glowing heat surrounding Indra and his flaring
power seem to depict something very like a solar Indra. The Maruts’ aid to Indra in
the Vṛtra battle (4c, where they are called ūtáyaḥ as here) stood them in good stead,
enabling them to bridge the distance between the human world and heaven by
hitching their wagon to a star (=sun, =Indra).
I do not quite understand the bhíyasā of b, though it obviously must be
considered in connection with the same word in the same metrical position in the b
pāda of the next verse. I assume it refers here to the awe- and fear-inspiring aspects
of Indra in his celestial form.
73</p>
<h3 id="i5210">I.52.10</h3>
<p>I agree with Ge (against Pp, Gr, Old, Re, WG) that loc. vájre should be read
for Pp. nom. vájraḥ and that this locative is functionally, but not grammatically,
parallel with áheḥ svanā́t “from the sound of the serpent.”
With Ge and Old (and back at least to Ludwig), I see no choice but to accent
the apparent voc. rodasī as ródasī. In the publ. tr. it should therefore be marked with
an asterisk.</p>
<h3 id="i5211">I.52.11</h3>
<p>I supply a form of √tan ‘extend’ in the first pāda, though with a general
injunctive sense, not the subjunctive of tatánanta in b. The “ten coils” of pāda a
invite an interpretation of increased or increasing space, as do the next verses with
their emphasis on distance and vast space.</p>
<h3 id="i5213">I.52.13</h3>
<p>The 2nd sg. act. forms bhuvaḥ and bhūḥ that serve as the main verbs of the
first two pādas respectively are difficult to distinguish. (Note that Hoffmann [Inj.
214–15] translates them both as “bist.”) The problem is made more acute by the fact
that though bhūḥ is definitely a root aor. injunctive, bhuvaḥ can either be the
injunctive (on which see comm. ad IV.16.18) or the subjunctive to the root aor., as it
is, in fact, in 11d. I have made an effort to distinguish them in tr., and given the
general preterital cast of this verse and the previous one I am reluctant to interpret
bhuvaḥ as subjunctive (“you will become the counterpart of earth”), though that
interpretation is not beyond possibility.</p>
<h2 id="i53-indra">I.53 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="i531">I.53.1</h3>
<p>I am puzzled by Ge’s (/WG) interpretation of this pāda, which introduces a
thief with no support from the text (“Noch nie hat ja einer das Kleinod wie (ein Dieb)
bei Schlafenden gefunden”). As far as I can tell, the proposed purport is that it’s easy
for a thief to find (and presumably steal) a treasure that belongs to people who are
asleep, but not so easy for us to do so in this case. WG remark that stealing
something from sleepers is a favored theme in later literature. But it is not otherwise
met with in the RV, as far as I know, and it doesn’t fit the context very well. I think
the point is rather simpler: we had better get to work presenting our praise to Indra
because the lazy and somnolent don’t get rewarded – “asleep at the switch” is an
English idiom for people who don’t pay attention.</p>
<h3 id="i532">I.53.2</h3>
<p>The slightly slangy tone of the previous verse is continued here, in the
repeated verb duráḥ ‘break out’ and the cpd. ákāmakarśana- ‘not shorting desires’,
as well, perhaps, as śikṣānará- (for which see AiG II.1.316–17, which classifies it
with cmpds of the type trasá-dasyu- with verbal 1st member governing the 2nd).
There is surely more to be said about śikṣānará-; among other things, its accent
doesn’t match the trasádasyu- type. But at least for now I will avoid the very
contentious topic of such cmpds. śikṣānará- is also found in IV.20.8.
74</p>
<h3 id="i533">I.53.3</h3>
<p>mā́… kā́mam ūnayīḥ “don’t leave the desire lacking” matches the compound
akāmakarśanaḥ “who does not short their desires” in 2c.</p>
<h3 id="i536">I.53.6</h3>
<p>tā́ni vṛ́ṣṇyā can be either nom. or acc. Most tr. opt for the former, but I do not
see how “bullish powers” can be the agent of exhilaration in the same way that soma
drinks are. Surely the point is to rouse Indra’s bullish powers for the fight to come.
Ge (/WG) take dáśa … sahásrāṇi as “ten thousand,” while Re separates the
two numbers as I do. The former interpretation is certainly possible, although the
distance between the words mildly supports taking them separately. The compound
numbers in vs. 9 are adjacent to each other. However, note navatím … náva ‘99’ in
I.54.6d.

<h3 id="i541">I.54.1</h3>
<p>The mā́prohibitive lacks a verb, and there is nothing nearby to supply. The
universal solution, “leave, abandon,” does the trick, although it would be nice to have
some support for it.
róruvad vánā is variously interpreted. I have taken vánā as extent-of-space,
though construing it as a second object of ákrandayaḥ (WG) would also be possible,
save for the fact that the same phrase recurs in 5b and WG must construe it with a
different verb. There seems no reason to supply a separate verb to govern it, as Ge
does: “(du knackest),” and taking vánā as agreeing with róruvat as Re does (“les
arbres (ont) grincé-violemment”) introduces unnecessary grammatical complications.
(Is he thinking of this as a variant on neuter pl. + sg. verb?) For an expression similar
to my suggested interpretation see váne … vacasyate “display his eloquence in the
wood” in the next hymn (55.4).</p>
<h3 id="i543">I.54.3</h3>
<p>The construction of the second hemistich is not entirely clear. Most tr. take
barháṇā kṛtáḥ together (e.g., Re “créé par une pression-violente”), but this requires
supplying a verb with the first part of pāda d (e.g., Re “(s’est mis)”). I instead think
the idiom is puráḥ √kṛ ‘put in front’ (I.102.9, VIII.45.9, X.171.4, of which the first
two have ‘chariot’ as obj. – e.g., VIII.45.9 rátham puráḥ … kṛṇotu). I do not take
háribhyām as an ablative, because 1) puráḥ + ABL is only dubiously attested, and 2)
setting Indra-as-chariot in front of his horses would be literally putting the cart
before the horse. I take háribhyām as dative, and think the idea is that Indra/the
chariot is set out front for the horses, that is, for them to be hitched up.
Ge and Re take vṛṣabháḥ with rátho hí ṣáḥ, but this is basically impossible,
given the position of the hí, which overwhelmingly takes 2nd position. Nonetheless I
agree that Indra is being identified with the chariot (not, however, with Ge the
75
chariot(-fighter)); WG supply “word” as the referent of sáḥ, but the striking equation
of Indra and chariot better fits the extravagance of the praise of Indra.</p>
<h3 id="i545">I.54.5</h3>
<p>ní … vṛṇákṣi is here tr. ‘yank down’, whereas in the preceding hymn, 9d, I
render ní … avṛṇak as ‘wrenched down’. The two should have been harmonized in
the publ. tr. More serious is the question of what object the verb takes here. Most tr.
use vánā, which, admittedly, is the only available accusative, but I am reluctant to
follow this interpretation for two reasons: 1) As noted above róruvad vánā also
appears in 1c, which suggests that these words belong together and one shouldn’t be
extracted to serve as a complement for a different verb; 2) I really doubt that there’s
an alternate version of the Śuṣṇa story that involves felling trees on his head. In fact
Śuṣṇa himself serves several times as the object of (ni) √vṛj (I.101.2 śúṣṇam aśúṣaṃ
ny ā́vṛṇak, also VI.18.8, 26.3). In nearby I.51.11 Indra destroys Śūṣṇa’s fortified
strongholds (dṛṃhitā́ḥ … púraḥ), and I’m inclined to supply them here, with Indra
wrenching them down onto the head of their hapless defender. Note that Indra also
destroys púraḥ in the next vs. (6d). I would thus change the publ. tr. to “as you
wrench down (the fortresses) of the snorting Śuṣṇa onto his head.”
The question in the last pāda, kás tvā pári, lacks a verb, but it does contain the
preverb pári, which suggests the solution: pari √vṛj is a common idiom meaning
‘evade, avoid’, and since the root √vṛj supplies the main verb of the earlier part of
the verse (5a ní … vṛṇákṣi), there is support for supplying it here, with the pleasing
effect that the two different preverbs used with it provide two different idioms.</p>
<h3 id="i546">I.54.6</h3>
<p>Support for supplying ‘help’ in pāda c (from āvitha in a) comes from
VIII.50.9 yáthā prā́va étaśam kṛ́tvye dháne, with the same root √av ‘help’ and the
same situation depicted.</p>
<h3 id="i547">I.54.7</h3>
<p>As Ge notes, práti inoti is not otherwise attested, and so its sense here is
unclear (Ge “der sich an das Gebot hält,” Re “qui … va au-devant de l’ordonnance,”
WG “der … das Gebot entgegensendet”). I prefer to read the práti as adverbial ‘in
turn’, not as a preverb, and ínvati in its usual transitive sense ‘drive, advance [smtg]’.

<h3 id="i5410">I.54.10</h3>
<p>A poetically dense verse with striking images and concomittant difficulties.
The first problem is the isolated compound dharúṇa-hvara-, modifying támaḥ
‘darkness’ in pāda a. The compound is generally interpreted as a tatpuruṣa, with -
hvara- in verbal sense governing the first member (e.g., Ge &ldquo;die den Urgrund der
Gewässer zu Fall brachte&rdquo;), but the accent is wrong: we would expect final accent of
the type puraṃ-dará- ‘fortress-smashing’, brahma-kārá- ‘formulation-making’. By
accent the compound should be a bahuvrīhi (so WG “deren Wölbung ihr Grund
war”). The s-stem hváras- means ‘snare, tangle’ (from the meaning of the root √hvṛ
‘go crookedly’). I suggest that hvará- has a similar meaning and the whole
76
compound means ‘whose tangles were the foundation (of the waters: apā́m)’. And
what would this mean?
In order to decode it, we must first note the use of dharúṇa- elsewhere in the
Savya hymns: 52.2: párvato ná dharúneṣu ácyutaḥ “like a mountain, immovable on
its foundations” and 56.5-6: ví yát tiró dharúṇam ácyutam … “when you traversed
the immovable foundation” and … divó dharúṇam … pṛthivyā́ḥ … “the foundation
of heaven and of earth.” Given the connection of dharúṇa- with ácyuta- and párvataelsewhere, I think we can confidently take the támaḥ in a and párvataḥ in b as
coreferential (unlike Ge [/WG], Re). Remember also that Vṛtra is associated with
murky darkness (e.g., his lying “on the foundation of the dusky realm” in I.52.6). In
other words the mountain within Vṛtra’s belly in pāda b is the pure darkness of pāda
a. Its “tangles” represent the inability to see a clear path in the dark and may also
represent what happens to vision as it gets dark, the blurring and distortion of objects.
These tangles provide a foundation, and an enclosure, for the waters. If I am correct,
it is a powerful image.
The second hemistich is also problematic. At issue is the meaning of anuṣṭhā́ḥ,
which Indra smashes. The form must be acc. pl. feminine (though Scar [644] allows
the possibility of a nom. sg. masc., which would necessarily separate it from the
preceding víśvāḥ). The lexeme ánu √sthā straightforwardly means ‘stand by, stand
following, stand along’ and can be used for helpers who stand by a leader (as indeed
in nearby I.52.4); see exx. adduced by Scar. Scar then reasonably suggests that
anuṣṭhā́ḥ here refers to ‘Gefolgsleute’ (sim. WG). But this introduces a set of
subordinates and helpers to Vṛtra that do not otherwise figure in this well-known
myth. Ge takes it as “Einsperrer” (barriers), which makes sense but is hard to extract
from the form. Re’s “les positions-successives” is apparently an attempt to render
Ge’s translation in a lexically legitimate way, but it doesn’t make much sense. My
“rows (of palings) … in succession” is a similar attempt, with the palings a complete
invention. I do not feel that a satisfying solution has yet been reached.</p>

<p>The object of the verb práti gṛbhṇāti in the frame, which would correspond to

<p>As Ge notes, √bhuj ‘enjoy, derive benefit’ is formulaically associated with
mountains, however odd that association may be to us. The question is then what
does Indra enjoy like a mountain. Ge takes it to be one of the elements in b, either the
‘principles’ (neut. pl. dhárman-) or the ‘manliness’ (neut. sg. nṛmṇá-), and interprets
masc. sg. tám in pāda as attraction from tā́ni or tád respectively. This is not
impossible, but I prefer to take the object in the frame as soma, which has the correct
gender and number, appeared in the previous vs. (2c), and is certainly something
Indra enjoys (although I have found no passages in which soma is explicitly
construed with √bhuj). The message of this first hemistich of vs. 3 – that Indra
displays manly power in order to enjoy the soma – is essentially the same as that of
2c, where he “acts the bull” to drink the soma.
Re rather trickily interprets the simile / frame construction with one verbal
expression in the frame (irajyasi “tu règnes sur”) and one in the simile (bhujé
“comme on jouit”), but this completely violates the structure of RVic similes, which
always hold the verbal notion constant between simile and frame. See Jamison 1982
(IIJ 24). WG supply soma, as I do, but also supply the verb ‘drink’ in pāda a and
separate it syntactically from pāda b. There seems no reason to do that.
In c I am very tempted to read *devátāti with one accent, the loc. sg. of
devátāt-, rather than the transmitted devátā́ti, that is, devátā + áti, with the adverbial
instr. to devátā plus the preverb áti. (An asterisk should therefore be inserted in the
publ. tr.) The loc. *devátāti would convey essentially the same meaning as devátā,
and though prá √cit is very common, prá-áti √cit would only occur here. For a
parallel construction with prá cékite + instr. and loc., see VI.61.13 prá yā́mahimnā́

great (rivers).”</p>
<h3 id="i554">I.55.4</h3>
<p>What’s going on in this verse is a little baffling, but it seems to concern
Indra’s participation in the ritual as a (quasi-)priest-poet, speaking along with the
other priests (namasyúbhiḥ)(a) and (b) announcing his own name at that ritual. (That
‘name’ should be supplied here is clear from I.57.3, another Savya hymn, with nā́ma
indriyám.) Indra’s “singing along” with the human priests, as it were, is also found in
the passages adduced in Ge’s n. to 4a. It is a familiar topic.
Indra also seems to be homologized to soma in the first pāda: the only other
occurrence of vacasyate is found in a soma hymn (IX.99.6), where soma “displays
his eloquence” while sitting in the cups (camū́ṣu). Our word vána- ‘wood(en)’ is
often used in the soma maṇḍala for the wooden cup in which soma is put, and a wellattested formula combines váne, the bull (there =soma), and noisemaking, as here:
IX.7.3 vṛ́ṣā́va cakradad váne “the bull has roared down into the wood(en) cup” (cf.
IX.74.1, 88.2, 107.22). This superimposition of soma imagery on Indra contributes to
the obscurity of this pāda, esp. what “in the wood” means in reference to Indra. Ge (n.
4a) seems to think of a sort of summer camp in the woods for ṛṣis and their families,
78
while Re suggests a “marche” in the forest. I doubt both scenarios, although I do not
have a satisfactory solution of my own. If váne … vacasyate evokes the phrase
róruvad vánā of the immediately preceding hymn (54.1, 5), it can on the one hand
refer to Indra’s loud roar while doing battle in a natural setting; but in a ritual context
it might refer to the sacrificial posts or to the wood for the ritual fire, though I am not
entirely persuaded by either.
Indra’s benevolent aspect, despite his bullish nature, is emphasized in the
second hemistich.</p>

<p>As noted in the intro., this martial verse contrasts with the peaceful preceding
one, a contrast emphasized by their parallel structure.
A cute play in nighánighnate, where the preverb ni appears to repeat in the
middle of the word, although the second ni consists of the root-final n of the
intensive reduplication followed by an i-liaison.</p>
<h3 id="i556">I.55.6</h3>
<p>This verse cannot be a single clause (as Re, WG seem to take it) because the
finite verb sṛjat in d lacks accent, while hí in the first pāda should induce accent on
the verb. But if we separate the last pāda from the rest, there is no main verb, just the
pres. participles vināśáyan and kṛṇván. Although present participles are rarely
predicated (as opposed to past participles), there are cases of such predication (pace
Lowe 2012), and I consider this one of them. In fact I connect the first three pāda of
this verse with the preceding verse, 5cd – with 6abc giving the reasons why the
people trust Indra – and the present participles in some sense reflect the intensive
(that is, iterative-frequentative) participle of 5d: he “is doing” rather than “did/does”
the actions; they are repetitive and ongoing.</p>
<h3 id="i557">I.55.7</h3>
<p>“mind on” is the English idiom and is therefore used here, despite the Skt.
dative dānā́ya.
kéta- can belong either to gods or to men; here they must be Indra’s since they
are identified with his sā́rathi- ‘coachmen, charioteers’. His intentions are
presumably to come to the sacrifice for praise and soma and, more to the point from
our point of view, to give to us, as expressed in the first pāda.</p>
<h3 id="i558">I.55.8</h3>
<p>The etymological figure in b, áṣāḷhaṃ sáhaḥ, rendered here with the
somewhat awkward “undominatable dominance” and belonging to the root √sah
‘vanquish, conquer’, is notable in part because the two root syllables ṣāḷh and sah
share no surface phonemes, since the past participle has undergone several regular
phonological processes that obscure its relationship to sah. Nonetheless any Vedic
speaker would instantly see the connection.
The simile in c is a little unclear in the absence of real-world knowledge of
life in Vedic India. WG suggest that, on departure from a temporary stopping place,
wells need to be covered over to avoid their getting filled in or otherwise damaged;
this seems reasonable, although I don’t see that this action needs to be restricted to
camps that are being left. In general it makes sense also in permanent settlements to
79
cover wells to avoid their being contaminated. In any case, the simile seems rather
more pointed and precise than necessary: that Indra has many hidden powers, mental
and physical, is a commonplace, and the image of wells seems, at least to me, a bit of
a distraction.</p>
<h2 id="i56-indra">I.56 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="i561">I.56.1</h3>
<p>A bit of a mess, but very clever, once decoded.
For the first hemistich two features of interpretation are crucial: 1) I read
*avatásya ‘of the well’ instead of áva tásya, a reading already suggested by Gr (s.v.
áva). The ‘well’ word appears in the last verse of the preceding hymn (55.8c) and so
belongs to Savya’s diction. 2) The simile / frame structure of ab involves a
disharmony, with the verb to be interpreted in two different senses. In the frame, prá
… úd ayaṃsta, with the medial s-aorist to √yam ‘hold’, has a fairly literal meaning:
‘raised forth for himself’. The object is the “many dippers” (pū́rvīḥ … camríṣaḥ) of
the well (*avatásya). (In the publ. tr. “this” should probably be replaced by “the,”
since tásya is by my reading no longer there.) The word camríṣ- is found only here,
but it appears to be related esp. to camrīṣá- (I.100.12), apparently ‘beaker’, and the
‘cup’ words (camasá-, camū́-) specialized for the serving of soma. The well is of
soma; in X.101.5-7 the preparation of soma is likened to raising water from a well. In
the simile (pāda b) the verb is used reflexively: the horse “raises himself up and
forward” to (mount) the mare, a pretty good representation of equine copulation. The
acc. yóṣām in the simile is not parallel to the acc. pū́rvīḥ … camríṣaḥ of the frame:
the latter is a direct object, while the former is a goal. The excitement of the
mounting stallion is implicitly transferred to Indra’s excitement at the many drinks of
soma in store for him.
In c I take dákṣam … hiraṇyáyam “golden skill” as a descriptor of soma:
golden because of its color, skill because drinking it gives Indra the ability to do
battle. It is a bit like calling alcoholic drinks “Dutch courage.” (In the next vs. Indra
is, or has become, the “lord of skill.”) The verb pāyayate is a lovely example of a
reflexive double I/T (in the terminology of my 1983 book): “he causes himself to
drink X,” with the appropriate middle voice. It is hard to know what (if anything) to
supply with mahé. I supply kárman- ‘deed’, whose only appearance in the RV is in
the preceding verse (55.3), Ge (/WG) “Kraft,” while Re takes mahé as standing for
an abstract, “pour (sa) grand(eur).” Any of these is possible; none is highly favored
over the others.
In d “ingenious” may not be the happiest tr. of ṛ́bhvas- as applied to an
inanimate thing. The word refers to craft or skill, and Re’s “habile(ment construit)”
may be the point.</p>
<h3 id="i562">I.56.2</h3>
<p>On nemanníśaḥ see the lengthy treatment by Scar (55-56). I take párīṇasaḥ
somewhat loosely, following Gr, as an adverbial ablative.
In c Ge takes sáhaḥ as a pāda-final truncation of instr. sáhasā as sometimes
elsewhere, but this seems unnecessary. In the final verse of the preceding hymn
(55.8) Indra took sáhas- into his body. It does not seem odd that he would here be
80
identified as sáhas- itself. The odd placement of nū́may support this analysis: the NP
vidáthasya … sáhaḥ may be structurally parallel to pátiṃ dákṣasya, and the 2ndposition nū́could mark the second NP as a new syntactic unit.</p>
<h3 id="i563">I.56.3</h3>
<p>“Like a mountain peak, … glints with its thrusting” – the image seems to that
of a pointed, snow-capped mountain, with the snow shining in the sun and the point
appearing to thrust into the sky, though of course it doesn’t move.
Again Ge suggests that pāda-final śávaḥ could be for instr. śávasā, though he
doesn’t so tr. – only wistfully remarks that ab could be a single sentence if śávaḥ
were instr.</p>
<h3 id="i564">I.56.4</h3>
<p>arhariṣváṇiḥ is completely unclear; -sváni- is ‘sound, noise’, but the first
member appears nowhere else and has no etymology. All tr. take it as a cry of
triumph, but this unanimity reflects a dearth of other choices rather than conviction
in its rightness. Ge suggests arhari might be onomatopoetic, but it’s hard to see what
sound it’s imitating. One tack might be to play with MIA possibilities, but juggling
the phonology according to known MIA sound laws has not so far yielded anything
useful.</p>
<h3 id="i565">I.56.5</h3>
<p>Though Gr and Lub take tiráḥ as the prepositional adverb, standard tr.
interpret it as the 2nd sg. injunctive to tiráti, which is surely the correct analysis.
There is a surprising disagreement among tr. as to what ácyutam ‘immovable’ should
modify. I take it with dharúṇam on the basis of Savya’s I.52.2 dharúṇeṣv ácyutaḥ. I
take rájaḥ as obj. of átiṣṭhipaḥ, despite the pāda boundary, since otherwise this
causative aorist is left without an expressed object.</p>
<h3 id="i566">I.56.6</h3>
<p>pāṣyā̀has neither an etymology nor a secure meaning; it occurs only once
elsewhere (pāṣyòḥ IX.102.2). Although the stem is given by Gr as (pāṣýa), pāṣía, it is
better taken to a vṛkī-type -ī́-stem pāṣī́- (see Old ad loc.; AiG I. Nachtr. p. 126;
tentatively also EWA s.v. pāṣāna-). By this analysis both forms can be du., and both
contexts support an interpr. as a twinned body part. In this passage it is used of
something belonging to Vṛtra that gets broken apart, so “jaws” is a contextually
attractive translation. Savya’s I.52.6 vṛtrásya … nijaghántha hánvor indra tanyatúm
“when you, Indra, struck your thunder down upon the two jaws of Vr̥tra” is similar to
our ví vṛtrásya … pāṣyā̀rujaḥ “you broke apart the two pāṣī́of V.” In IX.102.2 the
ref. seems to be to the two jaws of the soma-press. Despite the similarity of their
aberrant phonology, it is hard to connect our pāṣī́- with later pāṣāna- ‘stone’, widely
distributed also in Middle and New IA. See EWA s.v. pāṣāna- and, for the rejection
of the connection, Old.</p>

<h3 id="i571">I.57.1</h3>
<p>Unlike the standard tr., I take d to mean not that his generosity is meant to
display his power, but rather that his generosity has opened up to, that is, has been set
in motion by his exercise of power.
I.57.2–4: A bit of word play in the sequence haryatá(ḥ) (2c), haríto (3d), harya tád
(4d).</p>
<h3 id="i572">I.57.2</h3>
<p>Note the Wackernagel particle ha positioned between the preverb ánu and the
verb asat, despite the material preceding it in its clause.
With Ge I supply a verb of motion in b, because the “like waters to the depths”
simile regularly appears with one (e.g., V.51.7 nimnáṃ ná yanti síndhavaḥ).</p>
<h3 id="i573">I.57.3</h3>
<p>The phrase úṣo ná śubhre is quite problematic. In the first place, it is
syntactically odd to have a voc. in a simile (“X like o Dawn”). úṣaḥ may be vocative
by attraction from an underlying nominative, as in I.30.21 áśve ná citre aruṣi “O you,
dappled bright and ruddy like a(n o) mare.” Then, for reasons given in the intro., I
am certain that the fem. voc. śubhre in b cannot be addressed to the Sacrificer’s Wife,
despite the standard view, but that leaves the identity of the addressee baffling. Fem.
śubhrā́- is ordinarily used of Dawn herself, not someone or something like Dawn.
However, its other standard referent is Sarasvatī or another river or rivers (III.33.1-2,
VII.95.6, 96.2, V.42.12; waters V.41.12, maybe II.11.3; drops IX.63.26), so it is
barely possible that the water similes of vss. 1–2 here evoke an actual river to bring
the materials to the sacrifice. Better, but textually problematic: perhaps the identity
of simile and frame should be reversed, and the phrase means “O Dawn, like a lovely
(river), assemble …” (assuming an underlying *úṣaḥ śubhrā́ná…). This would make
fine sense in the passage: Dawn comes at the beginning of the sacrifice, bringing
materials for it, and is compared to a river that picks up material from its banks.
Although this requires more manipulation of the text than I would like, a sequence
such as I just reconstructed, with the ná following two feminine singulars, might
have seemed anomalous and been restructured to a more conventional order: X ná X’.
On balance and with due caution, I endorse this solution and would now translate the
phrase as suggested above.
As for the object of sám … ā́bharā, I supply ‘everything’, based on víśvam in
2a, also referring to the sacrificial materials.
The semantic basis for the simile in d is somewhat obscure. On the one hand,
the “tawny mares” (harít-) are often the horses of the sun, so that Indra has been
made a light (jyótiḥ) like the sun’s horses. On the other hand, Indra’s name and form
(dhā́ma … nā́mendriyám) are as suited for fame as horses are for running.
In d nā́yase is analyzed (starting with the Pp.) as ná áyase, but this produces a
bad cadence. I do not see any obstacle to assuming a preverb ā́, so ná ā́yase ‘for
coursing hither’, which fixes the cadence.</p>
<h3 id="i574">I.57.4</h3>
<p>The translation “Here we are &ndash; those of yours” reflects the annunciatory imé
as well as the te … té vayám, which identifies the speakers as Indra’s own.
82
In c I take cárāmasi as an independent verb, meaning to ‘carry on’ with life
and activities, though it is possible that it is an auxiliary verb with the gerund
ārábhya, as Ge takes it.
On kṣoṇī́- as ‘war-cry’, see Thieme (1978[79]: KZ 92: 46), EWA s.v.</p>

<p>The “cut” in the first hemistich is ambiguous in English but is a past tense
rendering pf. cakartitha. I added ‘apart’ despite the absence of ví because unadorned
English “cut the mountain” sounds odd. The vájreṇa vajrin opening pāda b at least
provides the desired v-.
Verbal play, in which two unrelated words mimic an etymological
connection: párvatam (a) … parvaśáḥ (b) “mountain … joint by joint.” The two
items are in the same metrical position, and each is in a pāda that begins with an
alliterative pair: t
u
váṃ tám and vájreṇa vajrin.</p>

<p>Phonetic figure spanning the end of the first hemistich and the second (esp. its

The lexeme ní √tud is generally taken to mean something like ‘spur on’, but
that tr. fails to render the ní. I prefer to take it in the literal sense ‘push down, force
down’, meaning that, in the English idiom, you can’t keep Agni down.
I connect pāda b with c, rather than with a, as the standard tr. do, because of
the difference in tense (pres. ní tundate, impf. ábhavat). This tense mismatch requires
the yád of b to have the sense “ever since” (Ge[/WG] “seitdem,” Re “depuis que”),
which does not seem to me to be natural to it. By contrast, Agni’s assuming the
office of messenger in b leads directly to his journey in c.</p>
<h3 id="i582">I.58.2</h3>
<p>In b tiṣṭhati can mean, as I take it, “stays (within)” or, with Ge, “stands up
(in).” In the latter case, the image would be of a forest fire, fed by brush, flaring up.
This is possible, but in the absence of the preverb úd or similar directional
indications, I prefer the former.</p>
<h3 id="i583">I.58.3</h3>
<p>On krāṇā́‘successfully’, derived from the old fem. instr. sg. of the med. root
aor. participle of √kṛ in adv. usage, see Old (Fs. Kern [1903] 33–36 = KlSch 1111–
14 [details in EWA s.v. kṛāṇā́]).
Since ví / ápa + ṛṇóti/ṛṇváti regularly refers to the unclosing of doors and the
like (e.g., I.128.6 dvā́rā vy ṛ̀ṇvati; IX.102.8 ṛṇór ápa vrajám), the tr. ‘distribute’ (Ge
‘teilt … aus’, WG ‘verteilt’, Re ‘répartit’) seriously manipulates the idiom. I
therefore prefer ‘disclose’ – that is, unclose and reveal to sight. (So also Old SBE.) In
this usage the stem has clearly assimilated itself to ūrṇoti (√vṛ) + ápa / ví ‘open’, and
one wonders if they were felt to belong to different roots by the poets. For further on
this stem see Kü 104–5.

<p>The voc. rúśad-ūrme ‘o you possessing gleaming waves’ should, strictly
speaking, not be accented. It may owe its accent to IV.7.9 krṣṇ̥ áṃ te éma rúśataḥ
puró bhā́ḥ “Black is your course, (though) you are gleaming; your light is in front,”
with a gen. sg. part. rúśataḥ following an identical opening. (So tentatively Bl RR.)
Or perhaps as the first of two voc., in post-caesura position, it was felt to begin a new
syntagm.</p>
<h3 id="i585">I.58.5</h3>
<p>On pā́jas- see Re ad loc. (n.; EVP XII) and EWA s.v., with lit. It seems to
refer to a surface or face, then to shape, area, or dimension in general, often with the
sense of “full dimension.”</p>

<p>On sthātúḥ (in the pair sthātúś carátham “the still and the moving”) as neut.
sg. to the -tar-stem (&lt; *-tṛ́) see AiG I.23, 301; III.204 and most recently Frotscher
2012. Tichy (1995: 71) rejects this explanation, but her alternative (a masc. nom. sg.
to a -tu-stem) breaks the tight rhetorical structure of this merism by pairing a
masculine with a neuter (carátham). Thus, whatever phonological problems there
may be in assuming an *-ṛ# &gt; -ur# change (as opposed to *-ṛs &gt; -ur as in the gen. sg.
of -ṛ-stems), I favor the older view. Frotscher’s suggestion that accented final -ṛ́
develops to -úr may help solve the problem. In any case the nom./acc. neut form here
would also be reinforced by the semantically identical genitive sg. phrase sthāthúś
ca &hellip; (jágataś ca (I.159.3, II.31.5).</p>

<p>The last halves of the two hemistichs are parallel and complementary,
referring to humans and gods respectively: b: … jánebhyaḥ# / d: … divyā́ya
jánmane#
In c mitrám is of course ambiguous: it can refer simply to the god of that
name (so Re), but more likely is at least a pun on the meaning of the common noun
‘ally’. Agni is often so called because he serves as go-between between gods and
men.</p>
<h3 id="i587">I.58.7</h3>
<p>The “seven tongues” (saptá juhvàḥ) are somewhat puzzling, or rather the
phrase has several possible interpretations. Re takes it as a “pré-bahuvrīhi” (probably
better expressed as “de-composed” bahuvrīhi), referring to the priests “having seven
offering ladles” (juhū́- meaning both ‘tongue’ and ‘ladle’); it is, of course, also
possible to take the ladles as subject without reference to an underlying bahuvrīhi (so
Old SBE, Ge), since inanimate things often have agency in the RV. But the other
meaning ‘tongue’ could also be meant literally (either in a de-composed bahuvrīhi or
not): (priests having) seven tongues, that is seven voices devoted to praising Agni.
See Ge’s n. (also WG). This interpretation would make the first pāda semantically
parallel with the second, where ‘cantors’ (vāghátaḥ) is the subject. And I will add
another, more distant possibility, but one that makes better sense of the ‘seven’ – viz.,
the seven rivers or streams. The seven rivers are credited with giving birth to and
nourishing Agni in a mystical passage in III.1.3–6, where they are also identified as
84
seven vā́ṇīḥ ‘voices’ (III.1.6d). Seven is a number especially characteristic of rivers,
and since rivers are often said to be noisy (indeed the word nadī́- ‘river’ is derived
from the root √nad ‘roar), calling the rivers “seven tongues” here would fit
semantically. In the end I don’t think that choosing one of these possibilities and
eliminating the others is the right strategy; the phrase is meant to be multivalent,
evoking a number of features of the ritual context.
I.58.8–9: Vs. 9 is essentially a paraphrase of vs. 8, with several parallel expressions.
And the final pāda of 9 is the Nodhas refrain.

<h3 id="i594">I.59.4</h3>
<p>The first pāda of this verse is metrically disturbed, which, in conjunction with
its syntactic incompleteness, leads some tr. to consider the text corrupt. I’m afraid I
find that reasoning too convenient.
This verse is variously interpreted, with its difficulties in great part arising
from the fact that there is no finite verb, but it can be decoded by paying attention to
the functional roles of the nominal complements. What seems to unify the verse is
the presence of a dative recipient in pādas a, cd, and I therefore (with most tr., but
not Ge) take the verse to be a single sentence, with the datives throughout referring
to Agni. The objects presented to Agni are songs (gíraḥ b), qualified as many (pūrvī́ḥ
c), and implicitly compared to exuberant maidens (yahvī́ḥ d), based on the fact that
gír- ‘song’ is feminine in gender. The grammatical subject is hótā in b, with parallel
subjects in similes: the two world halves (ródasī) in the first pāda and “skill”
(dákṣaḥ) in the second. The manuṣyàḥ in b I read twice: on the one hand, its position
directly before ná marks it as the first word of the simile, going with dákṣaḥ, hence
“Manu’s/manly skill,” but I believe it should also be read with the immediately
preceding hótā (“manly/human Hotar”). In Agni hymns the title Hotar is ordinarily
specialized as a designation of that god (see, e.g., immediately preceding I.58, vss.1,
3, 6–7), and manuṣyàḥ here would make it clear that the human priest is at issue, with
Agni himself the dative recipient. The last question is what verb to supply, and in a
sense the exact identity of the verb is not terribly important, as long as it has
approximately the right meaning and the right case frame. With Old (SBE, Noten) I
supply ‘bring’ (√bhṛ), which is frequently used with gíraḥ and a dative recipient (e.g.,</p>
<h3 id="i7910">I.79.10</h3>
<p>… agnáye / bhárasva … gíraḥ), but ‘sing, present, give,’ etc., would all work.
I do not see any reason for, or justification of, supplying a 1st
-person subject,
however, pace Old SBE (1st pl.), Ge, Re (1st sg.).
I.59.5–6: 5d pāda here = VII.98.3d, of Indra, and Nodhas uses a similar expression of
Indra in I.63.7d. Vs. 6 is even more Indraic. As noted in the intro., this part of the
hymn is designed to associate Indra and his great deeds with Agni.

<p>Taking off from my comment below on vs. 5, JL has further articulated the structure
of this hymn. What follows is mostly verbatim from his comments, with some
additions and light editing of my own:
I think this little hymn might have a slightly more elegant structure than has
been appreciated (I thought of this following your mention ad vs. 5 of the “faint
ring”). It seems to me that the 5 verses are nicely balanced rings within rings
revolving around vs. 3, the omphalos-like jā́yamānam… jījananta, harking back to
Agni’s double birth in 1c. The outer rings would be, as mentioned ad vs. 5, vss. 1c
rayím iva praśastám = 5 pátim &hellip; rayīnā́m, prá śaṃsāmaḥ. Vss. 2 and 4 contain the
same word vikṣú; note esp. the alliterative and partly etymological figure in 2d
viśpátir vikṣú vedhā́ḥ. The hymn has not only a ring structure, but also forward
momentum provided by the movement from the larger social organization of the vís-,
in the full expression viśpátir vikṣú (2d), to the more intimate setting of the home,
emphatically presented in 4c dámūnā gṛ́hapatir dáme. The momentum can also be
tracked in the expressions of lordship involving páti-: viśpáti- (2d) to gṛhapáti- (4c)
and finally the solemnly pleonastic rayipátī rayīṇā́m (4d). Agni, celebrated (√śaṃs)
“like wealth” in 1c (rayím iva), is transformed into the lord of wealth in 4d. This final
title is repeated in 5a pátim agne rayīṇā́m, with his name interposed between the two
elements, and again the object of √śaṃs. The use of these three -páti- compounds
may convey the message that Agni will deploy his wealth in the arenas of clan and
house.</p>
<h3 id="i602">I.60.2</h3>
<p>diváś cit pū́rvaḥ is standardly taken as temporal “before day(break),” but this
case form of div/dyu is more often spatial than temporal (note diváś cid … bṛhatáḥ in
the immediately preceding hymn, 59.5), and pū́rva- + ABL. has a spatial sense
elsewhere in just this ritual context: e.g., X.53.1 ní hí ṣátsad ántaraḥ pū́rvo asmát
“for he [=Agni] will sit down (as Hotar) close by, in front of us.” Cf. also II.3.3

<p>ṛ́cīṣama-, an epithet of Indra, is an impossible word; Ge wisely refuses to tr. it.
However, it is difficult not to see in it a combination of ṛ́c- ‘chant, song’ and samá-
‘like, same’, however obscure the morphological details are – and obscure they
certainly are. The first member cannot, straightforwardly, be a case form of ṛ́cbecause the case-ending should be accented. The length of the -ī- might be analogical
to the long ī in phonologically similar ṛjīpín-, ṛjīṣín-, but motivating a short -i- (in
putative *ṛ́ci-) is hard enough (Caland compounding form, like śúci-?). It is tempting
(and some have succumbed to the temptation) to connect -sama- with another
designation of ritual speech, sā́man-, but the difference in vowel length is probably
fatal. Note that in our passage the word is adjacent to another old crux, ádhrigu-, the
controversies about which (see KEWA and EWA s.v.) should have been definitely
settled by comparison with OAv. drigu- ‘poor, needy’ (Narten, YH 238–40). Both
ṛ́cīṣama- and ádrigu- are disproportionately represented in the VIIIth Maṇḍala, the
home of much aberrant vocabulary. In the end those who elect to tr. ṛ́cīṣama- take it
as a compound of the two elements suggested above: Re ‘égal à la strophe’, WG
(somewhat peculiarly, though starting with the same elements) ‘der im Preislied
(immer) als dieselbe Person erscheint (?)’; so also the publ. tr. ‘equal to song’. For
further, see EWA s.v.

bhárāmi picks up both 1c harmi and 1d bráhmāṇi, and 2a asmā́íd u práyaḥ … prá
yaṃsi playfully echoes 1a asmā́íd u prá…, with práyaḥ of 1b substituted for the bare
preverb prá.</p>
<h3 id="i612">I.61.2</h3>
<p>In addition to the inter-verse echoes just noted, alliteration in 2c mánasā
manīṣā́and 2d pratnā́ya pátye. JL adds 2a práya iva prá yaṃsi.
bā́dhe in 2b is universally taken as a dat. infinitive (as it is in I.132.5), but this
makes semantic difficulties because √bādh means ‘thrust, press, oppress’. Ge’s “um
(ihn) … zu nötigen(?),” Re’s “pour contraindre (le dieu),” and WG’s “um (ihn) … zu
überhäufen” thus misrepresent the sense of the verb. The √bādh is esp. common with
the preverbs ápa and ví in the meanings ‘thrust away, thrust apart’, but I here take the
prá of pāda a with both verbs (bhárāmi and bā́dhe) in pāda b. As for morphology, I
take bā́dhe as a 1st sg. mid. pres. (the root is always inflected in the middle), rather
than as an infinitive, which allows the root to maintain its standard sense: I push the
hymn toward Indra with particular forcefulness. As a finite verb, bā́dhe owes its
accent to its initial position in the new clause.
suvṛktí- is a bahuvrīhi specialized for praise hymns (and occasionally the gods
who receive them) and is often simply tr. ‘praise(-song)’ (e.g., Ge ‘Preis’ here). I
prefer to render it literally; -vṛktí- belongs to the root √vṛj ‘twist’, and the English
87
idiom “good twist” refers to particularly clever turns in a plot or other verbal
products.
Most tr. take c with d, not ab. This is possible, but not necessary.</p>
<h3 id="i614">I.61.4</h3>
<p>As Ge suggests (in n. 3 to his n. to 4ab), the apparent pleonastic doubling of
the simile particle (ráthaṃ ná tā́ṣṭā-iva) may instead signal that two images have
been crossed here: one with a simplex hinomi (“I impel the praise like a chariot”) and
the other with sáṃ hinomi and the addition of the carpenter as subject (“I, like a
carpenter, put together praise, like a chariot”).</p>
<h3 id="i615">I.61.5</h3>
<p>juhvā̀has its standard double meaning, ‘tongue’ and ‘offering ladle’, a pun
that is enabled by the verb sám añje “I anoint”: anointing with the tongue means
producing praise, while ‘offering ladle’ fits better with the literal meaning of the verb.
dānaúkas- is likewise of double sense, both ‘accustomed to giving’ and
‘accustomed to gifts’, representing the reciprocal trade in praise and sacrifice given
to the gods, in return for the gods’ material gifts to us.</p>
<h3 id="i616">I.61.6</h3>
<p>The tváṣṭā here has been prepared for by 4b táṣṭā, and both appear in
alliterative phrases: táṣṭeva tátsināya and tváṣṭā takṣat.
Another word with a standard double sense: ráṇa-; both senses are possible
here, also in vs. 9 below.
The position of yéna in this subordinate clause is anomalous, as we expect at
most one constituent to precede the yá- form. I have no explanation, but there is
much that is off-kilter in the deployment of sentence parts in this hymn.
I’ve tr. the participle tuján as it were a finite verb, because the English
otherwise dribbles off into unintelligibility. In fact, because of the rel. cl. in c, it’s
better to take d as a new cl. with tuján as predicated participle (“Gaining mastery, he
was thrusting …”). On this stem see comm. ad IX.91.4.
The unclear kiyedhā́- is found only here and in vs. 12. See EWA s.v. and
Scar’s (250–52) discussions of previous attempts at explanation. I favor the
suggestion registered (and dismissed) by Scar that it consists of the weak stem of
kíyant-‘how much, how great’ + the root noun dhā́-, with the development *-nt̥-dh- &gt;
*-adzdh- &gt; *-azdh- &gt; -edh-, despite Hoffmann’s dismissal of the posited
phonological development (Aufs. 400)—although I recognize the phonological
problems of this solution. Re’s “lui qui confère (on ne sait) combien” represents this
etymology one way or the other.</p>
<h3 id="i617">I.61.7</h3>
<p>On the introductory gen. asyá referring to Indra, even though Indra is
otherwise in the nominative in this verse (as subj. of papivā́n [b] and of vídhyat [d]),
see disc. in intro. and in Jamison 2007 noted above.
The verse concerns Indra’s surreptitious drinking of his father’s soma right
after birth, an act enabled by his mother (ab), and Indra and Viṣṇu’s vanquishing of
the Emuṣa boar (cd), a rarely told tale. For Indra’s mother’s complicity in the somadrinking, see esp. III.48.2–3. In our passage Indra’s father is not directly referred to
88
(only by initial maháḥ ‘of the great [one]’ in b), but the beginning of the next word
promises the genitive of ‘father’ (i.e., pitúr), and only the final consonant of pitúm
removes that possibility — one of the many tricks Nodhas plays on us in this hymn.
(Ge ascribes the absence of pitúḥ to Worthaplologie, but I think rather that Nodhas is
laying a trap.)
On the basis of other tellings of the Emuṣa myth, the word to supply with
pacatám is odanám ‘rice-porridge’; cf. VIII.69.14, 77.6, 10.
The final pāda is quite artfully composed, beginning and ending with
alliterative phrases: vídhyad varāhám and ádrim ástā. Moreover, the first of these is a
variant of the very common formula that compresses the Vṛtra slaying, áhann áhim
“he/you slew the serpent.” Here, with the victim beginning with v-, the poet
substitutes a verb beginning with v-.</p>
<h3 id="i618">I.61.8</h3>
<p>Although I tr. devápatnīḥ as ‘wives of the gods’, it is of course grammatically
a bahuvrīhi ‘having the gods as husbands’ (with the fem. stem patnī- substituted for
the masc. equivalent pati- in this feminine adjective). It reminds us of dāsápatnī-
‘having a Dāsa for a husband’, applied to the waters confined by Vṛtra, often
identified as a Dāsa, most famously in I.32.11 but also twice elsewhere of the waters
and Vṛtra (V.30.5, VIII.96.13). Since the context here is the Vṛtra battle (ahihátye),
the complementary terminology is probably deliberate.
JL notes that there is complementarity also in the second hemistich: 8c has
pári jabhre with Indra as subject and dyā́vāprthivī ́as object, while 8d reverses this:
ná &hellip; pári staḥ with dyā́vāprthiv ̥ ī ́as implicit subj. and Indra as implicit
object (via his mahimā́nam). This theme and its lexicon are picked up in the
9ab: mahitvám / divás pṛthivyā́ḥ páry antárikṣāt.</p>
<h3 id="i619">I.61.9</h3>
<p>The phrase “reverberant tankard” (svarír ámatraḥ) is striking, but intelligible
in Ṛgvedic context. Indra is compared to a large drinking vessel because of his
immense capacity and size, also described in 8cd and 9ab; “tankard” hints at his
ability to drink vast quantities of soma and implicitly promises his generosity
because he can contain vast quantities of goods. I follow Old in taking all forms of
ámatra- as belonging to a single stem (pace Gr, Lub, and EWA). As for ‘reverberant’
(svarí-), it echoes svarā́ḷ, which opens the preceding pāda; it also suggests the deep
sound made when a large (empty) vessel is struck and Indra’s own war-cries. (For a
possibly similar image, see I.100.12.)</p>
<h3 id="i6110">I.61.10</h3>
<p>Numerous phonological plays in this verse: a śávasā śuṣántam; b ví vṛścad
vájreṇa vṛtrám; c gā́ná vrā́nā avánīr (in this last example note the rhyme of the 1st
two words with the 2nd one).</p>
<h3 id="i6111">I.61.11</h3>
<p>This verse nicely juxtaposes a well-known deed of Indra’s, when he stops
the waters to make a ford for his client(s), with the even better known deed of
releasing the stopped waters in the Vṛtra myth, treated in the preceding vs. (10). On
the playful transition between these two myths here, see Jamison 2007: 113–14 n. 20.
89
The stopping of the waters causes mild surprise immediately after a verse concerning
their release.
tveṣásā is universally taken as belonging to Indra, whereas my published tr.
ascribes it to the rivers. I would now probably correct this, also to take it as Indra’s:
“just this one – with his turbulence/glittering,” because of the parallelism between
10a asyéd evá śávasā and 11a asyéd u tveṣáśā. But I am still disturbed by the form.
Its accent suggests that it should be adjectival, not a neuter -s-stem abstract like
śávas-, despite AiG II.2.224, which implies that it is nominal despite its accent. It is
curious that the expected root-accented neut. noun (*tvéṣas-) is not attested, and this
is the only (supposed) attestation of the suffix-accented stem. If it is a real adjective,
it could modify vájreṇa in pāda b, but this not only breaks the parallelism between
10a and 11a just noted, but, more seriously, would have to be extracted from one
clause and plunked into the next. (Ge in his note suggests supplying vájreṇa in pāda
a.) The a-stem adj. tveṣá- is also sometimes used of waters, e.g., VI.61.8 tveṣáḥ …
arṇaváḥ “glittering/turbulent flood,” which accounts for my original connection of
tveṣásā with the rivers.
The distribution of elements in pāda b is odd, with the subordinating yád in
normal 2nd position, but sīm, ordinarily another 2nd position element, just before the
verb.
īśāna-kṛ́t- is variously interpreted, either with the 1st member in a direct
object relationship with the 2nd &ndash; “zum Herrscher, mächtig machend” (Scar’s tr; sim.
also Ge, Re, WG) – or in a sort of appositive subject relationship, “als Herrscher
handelnd” (Scar’s tr.; sim. Gr). Because the first member īśāna- is itself a participial
form ‘being lord, showing mastery’, I prefer the 2nd alternative. Note also that
independent ī́śāna- is used three times of Indra in this hymn (6d, 12b, 15b), and it is
more likely that the same form in the compound refers to Indra’s masterful ways, not
to someone else whom he makes masterful. Scar allows both, though somewhat
preferring the 2nd.
More phonological play: c dāśúṣe daśasyan; d turvī́taye … turváṇiḥ.</p>
<h3 id="i6112">I.61.12</h3>
<p>On this very tricky verse, I simply reproduce (slightly paraphrased) my
discussion of it in Jamison 2007: 66: The beginning of 12 appears to return us from
the mythological past to the realm of the current-day poet of vss. 1-5; not only does it
start with the dative pronoun after a series of verses with the genitive phrase but it
continues with a standard lexeme for presenting a hymn to a divinity: prá √bhr̥:
asmā́íd u prá bharā &hellip; Cf. from the same poet also with a dative recipient I.64.1b.
nódhaḥ suvrkt ̥ ím prá bharā marúdbhyaḥ “O Nodhas, present a well-turned (hymn) to
the Maruts.” But the phrase in 61.12 quickly goes awry. At the opening of the next
pāda, where Indra&rsquo;s name has been prominently placed in previous verses (índrāya
1d, 4d, 5b, 8b), we find, most shockingly, the name of his arch-enemy, vr̥trā́ya,
immediately followed by the accusative object vájram, Indra&rsquo;s weapon, not the word
for hymn we were expecting. The relevant parts of the half-verse asmā́íd u prá
bharā&hellip;, vrtr̥ ā́ya vájram&hellip; must mean &ldquo;Towards just this one, towards Vr̥tra, bear
down the mace&hellip;&rdquo; The poet has simply tricked us, having laid a trap with
90
conventional phraseology and syntax and with the stylistic patterns established
earlier in the hymn. He also skillfully exploits the morphological ambiguity of the
verb form bharā: given the pattern set in vss. 1-5 we are primed to interpret bharā as
a 1st sg. subjunctive (cf. indicative bhárāmi in vss 2-3), but as the half verse unfolds,
it becomes clear that bharā must rather be taken as a metrically lengthened 2nd sg.
imperative. [end of citation]
In order to let the audience in on the trick, the poet has imported much of
verse 6, the first mention of the Vṛtra conflict in this hymn: 6d reads tujánn ī́śānas
tujatā́kiydhā́ḥ “gaining mastery, thrusting with the thrusting (mace), while
conferring (who knows) how much,” while 12ab echoes this with … tū́tujāno, …
ī́śānaḥ kiyedhā́ḥ “thrusting, gaining mastery, conferring (who knows) how much.”
In d íṣyan echoes ī́śānaḥ of pāda b (as well as 11c) and anticipates iṣṇānáḥ of
13c.</p>
<h3 id="i6113">I.61.13</h3>
<p>On this verse as a species of “poetic repair” of verse 12, see Jamison 2007:
66–67. The expected offering of praise to Indra thwarted in 12ab is successfully
effected in 13ab.</p>
<h3 id="i6114">I.61.14</h3>
<p>dyā́vā ca bhū́mā has the appearance of a dual dvandva, interrupted by the ca
that connects it to the NP with which it’s conjoined, giráyaś ca dṛḷhā́ḥ. But the
uninterrupted dvandva is actually dyā́vābhū́mī, with a different stem for ‘earth’, and
bhū́man- (n.) has no dual attested (and its dual should of course not be bhū́mā, but
probably *bhūmanī). See the next hymn for a variant on this usage. It is likely that
the lengthened N/A sg. form or the N/A pl. form is being used, but why? On this
problem, see AiG II.1.152.
In the publ. tr., “other” was careless omitted at the end of the first hemistich:
it should read “against each other.”
The mention of the poet Nodhas at the very end of the verse has perhaps been
prepared by several not entirely expected o’s: úpo &hellip; jóguvāna oṇíṃ, sadyó, only the
last of which is a normal sandhi o &lt; -as. The poet’s fondness for his own vowel may
account for the appearance of several relatively rare words: the intensive jógu- and
the noun oṇí-.</p>
<h3 id="i6115">I.61.15</h3>
<p>I follow Ge’s suggestion (in n. to 15a, followed by WG) that the unexpressed
subject that is being conceded to Indra is the soma-drink. The parallel he adduces,
V.29.5, contains the gods, the soma-drink, the concession, and Etaśa:
ádha krátvā maghavan túbhyaṃ devā́ánu víśve adaduḥ somapéyam
yát sū́ryasya harítaḥ pátantīḥ puráḥ satī́r úparā étaśe káḥ
Then according to your will, o bounteous one, all the gods conceded the
soma-drinking to you,
when you put the flying golden mares of the Sun behind, though they were in
front, in Etaśa(&rsquo;s presence).
In the publ. tr. I take eṣām as a genitival agent, somewhat reluctantly. However, ET
suggests a much more attractive solution, which rescues the syntax: that eṣā́m is
91
dependent on asmaí “just to this one of them [=gods].” The singularity of Indra
would then be emphasized by the ékaḥ that begins the next pāda.
Etaśa is the horse of the Sun and is not, as far as I know, a soma-presser (the
physical image is a little comical). Against all tr., I therefore do not take súṣvim in d
as coreferential with étaśam in c, but rather as a second object with the verb. Nodhas
is now juggling the mythic past (the aiding of Etaśa) and the desired future (the
aiding of the soma-presser), as he nears the end of the hymn. I read the participle
paspṛdhānám twice, once with each object, with a different desired goal in the
locative for each. I also give the verb āvat two simultaneous morphological analyses,
fitting its two objects: the first as augmented imperfect to the Class I present ávati,
the second as perfect subjunctive to the pf. ā́va (cf. āpas, āpat taken by Hoffmann
1967: 64 n. 102, 101 n. 220, and Kümmel 2000: 118 as subjunctives to pf. ā́pa √āp
‘attain’). Although such an interpretation might be too artificial in some cases, I have
no hesitation in assuming Nodhas is capable of this.
Another phonetic play: d saúvaśvi
ye súṣvim</p>
<h3 id="i6116">I.61.16</h3>
<p>hāriyojanā is unaccented and therefore taken by most as a vocative
addressed to Indra. I follow Old in emending to an accented form (hāriyojanā́),
modifying bráhmāṇi. See in the next hymn bráhma hariyójanāya “formulation for
the fallow-bay-yoking.” As Old points out, taking it as a vocative with Indra requires
either shortening the last vowel or allowing a lengthened vocative ending (which is
not usual), and possibly also shortening the first vowel.
This verse is extra-hymnic in some ways: its opening breaks the pattern set in
the previous 15 vss.; it makes a meta-announcement about the contents of the hymn
just recited; and it ends with the Nodhas refrain. But it also forms a ring with the first
verse, with the repetition of bráhmāṇi, and with the first part of the hymn concerning
the presentation of praise-hymns, with the reappearance of suvṛktí, which was a
signature word there (2b, 3d, 4c).</p>
<h2 id="i62-indra">I.62 Indra</h2>
<p>Shares much vocabulary with I.61 and sometimes plays off the turns of phrase
in that hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i621">I.62.1</h3>
<p>Rich with phonetic figures: a śavasānā́ya śūṣám; b āṅgūṣáṃ gírvaṇase
aṅgirasvát [note that āṅgūṣám participates in both: it rhymes with preceding śūṣám,
but its initial matches aṅgirasvát, while gírvaṇase takes up the 2nd syllable of
aṅgirasvát]; cd ṛgmiyā́ya, árcāma arkám [this last also a clear etymological figure].
śavasānā́ya śūṣám recalls śávasā śuṣántam of 61.10a in the same metrical
position, with our phrase referring to Indra, the one in I.61 to Vṛtra.
The Pp. reads stuvaté in c, a reading that is universally followed. But this
dative is awkward: if it is coreferential with the other datives in the verse, it must
refer to Indra, and Indra “praising” is an odd concept in a hymn devoted instead to
presenting praises to him. Although Indra occasionally joins in the verbal parts of the
sacrifice (see above ad I.55.4), he does not ordinarily (or ever?) praise others.
92
Nonetheless, this is Re’s solution: “(dieu) louangeur.” Schmidt (1968, B+I, 163)
suggests a variant of this: “den mit guten Liedern (selbst) preisenden,” but self-praise
suggests a medial form, not the active we have. If the participle does not modify
Indra, another person in the dative needs to be introduced, despite the unlikelihood of
a separate dative referent. This is Ge’s solution: “ihn [=Indra], der für den Sänger …
zu preisen ist,” construing stuvaté with ṛgmiyā́ya. So also WG with slightly different
tr., though both they and Ge consider the “praising” possibility. But the difficulty
disappears if, against the Pp., we read instead stuvatáḥ, genitive sg. of the participle,
as I do.</p>
<h3 id="i622">I.62.2</h3>
<p>This verse is in some ways a double of vs. 1. They both begin with prá, and
the opening phrases prá manmahe and prá vo mahé rhyme, although the two mahe’s
have entirely different analyses. (Note also the mahé máhi play in 2a.) The next
phrase of 1a, śavasānā́ya śūṣám, is paralleled in 2b, with the first word identical and
sā́ma substituting for the second (both śūṣám and sā́ma referrring to the verbal
product offered to Indra). At the beginning of the second pādas, āṅgūṣyàm of 2b
matches āṅgūṣám of 1a. “Like the Aṅgirases” (aṅgirasvát) of 1b is picked up by the
Aṅgirases themselves áṅgirasaḥ in 2d, and the heavy etymology figure involving the
root √arc ‘chant’ is reprised by the participle árcantaḥ in 2d, which opens its pāda
just as the finite verb árcāma does in 1d.</p>
<h3 id="i623">I.62.3</h3>
<p>I follow Janert (1956, Sinne und Bedeutung des Wortes “dhāsi” und seiner
Belegstellen im Rigveda und Awesta) in taking dhāsí- as ‘wellspring’.
The post-caesura phrase in c bhinád ádriṃ vidád gā́ḥ contains rhyming verbs
followed by their objects; the disyllable ádrim contrasts with monosyllable gā́ḥ,
creating an almost syncopated effect. The strict parallelism of the two VPs may
account for the unnecessary accent on bhinát, which functions rhetorically like a
fronted verb, just like vidát. In fact, as my tr. indicates, I consider the initial subject
bṛ́haspátiḥ to be essentially extrasentential, a very topicalized topic.
The second of the VPs is also a mirror-image of the final phrase in 2d gā́
ávindan (imperfect in 2, versus aorist in 3), and it can be considered a “repair” of the
somewhat opaque vidát … dhāsím “found the wellspring” that intervenes (3b).</p>
<h3 id="i624">I.62.4</h3>
<p>The repetitions and lexical and phonological echoes that have served Nodhas
well in the first three verses increase here, to an almost incantatory level. To point to
a few of these: a sá suṣṭúbhā sá stubhā́(again a syncopation, as in 3c); b svaréṇa …
svarí
yo …; c: saraṇyubhiḥ echoes the sá’s of a and the s(v)ar’s of b, while finding its
own faint echo in the final śakra of the pāda; d ráveṇa is a virtual anagram of
svaréṇa in b, darayo is almost a rhyme form of svarí
yo in b in the same metrical
position, and both svarí
yo and darayo precede the hemistich-final words ending in -
gvaiḥ.
All other tr. take this verse as a single sentence with 2nd ps. subj. However, as
I have shown (1992: “sa figé”), sá with 2nd ps. reference is limited to imperatives and
should not appear with an injunctive like darayaḥ. I therefore consider the first
93
hemistich to continue the 3rd ps. reference of vs. 3, with a switch to 2nd ps. in the
second half. This type of switch is quite common in the RV.
In c I do not take saraṇyú- and phaligá- as personal names, pace Ge et al. The
tr. ‘bolt’ for the latter follows Hiersche (Asp., ‘Riegel, Vershluss’), based on a
possible connection with parigha- (Up+) ‘iron bar for shutting a door/gate’; see
EWA s.v. However, as ET points out, a less specific sense such as ‘barrier’ would fit
the contexts better and would also make fewer assumptions about early technology.</p>
<h3 id="i625">I.62.5</h3>
<p>The instrumentals in b (uṣásā sū́ryeṇa góbhiḥ) are not parallel with
áṅgirobhiḥ in a. The Aṅgirases there are the agents of the passively used participle
gṛṇānáḥ (and also potentially instrumental of accompaniment with the main verb, as
Indra’s helpers: “along with the A’s you uncovered…”). The instrumentals in b are
the additional elements that Indra uncovered.
ándhaḥ is a potential pun, as a homophone meaning both ‘blind darkness’ and
‘soma stalk’. The former is surely the first reading in this treatment of the Vala myth,
with the cave a black hole, as it were. So Ge, Re, WG. But soma is never far from
Indra’s mind, and the cosmogonic deeds with which he is credited in the second
hemistich are often performed under the influence of soma. Schmidt (p. 164) favors
‘(Soma-)Flut’, following Bergaigne and Lüders.</p>
<h3 id="i626">I.62.6</h3>
<p>This verse has to be Nodhas’s joke. It is conspicuously placed, as the central
verse of the hymn and thus a potential omphalos, and it announces Indra’s deed
(kárma) with extraordinary fanfare, including two superlatives (práyakṣatamam …
cā́rutamam). But in a hymn so far devoted to what is one of Indra’s greatest deeds,
the opening of the Vala cave, the poet springs on us instead a deed of utter obscurity
involving the swelling of four rivers, an act with no other clear mentions in the RV.
Ge valiantly seeks parallels, but the two passages he adduces (I.104.3–4 and I.174.7)
have little or nothing in common with our passage and it’s not even clear that there
are rivers in the second. Lüders (Varuṇa 335-37) predictably sees these as heavenly
rivers — four because they flow “nach den vier Himmelsgegenden.” Re also sees
them as associated with heaven, while Schmidt (B+I 164) and WG seem to see them
as being “under” (something unspecified). I have no solution for the affinities of this
scrap of mythology, although I tend to agree generally with Lüders that the rivers are
more likely to be celestial than terrestrial, and I would suggest that it may have to do
with producing rain. But I still think the point here is that Nodhas has set us up for a
grand announcement and then, by bait and switch, given us a myth that none of us
has ever heard of.
The asti in this hemistich may provide another bit of evidence for this view.
Unaccented asti almost always has existential value (“there exists…”) because the 3rd
sg. pres. copula in equational sentences (“X is Y”) is regularly (indeed, probably by
rule) gapped. But an existential sense here doesn’t work (“There exists this most
conspicuous deed…”). I suggest that the overt asti here signals a strong assertion in
the face of expected opposition (“This is his most conspicuous deed” – rather like
American children’s quarrels: “is too” “is not”).
94
The disputed word upahvaré adds to the obscurity of this bit of myth. It is
clearly a derivative of √hvṛ ‘go crookedly, deviate’, but the exact sense of this
nominal derivative is not clear. In this passage Ge takes it as ‘lap’ (Schoss), Re as
‘fold, crease’ (repli), WG as ‘abyss, chasm’ (Abgrund), while Schmidt bypasses any
literal rendering with “im Felsen.” Lüders considers it the name “für den Behälter
des himmlischen Urquells,” which of course fits his larger picture of the heavenly
ocean. I consider the word to convey in the first instance a visual image, that of a
meander or deviation from the straight. In connection with rivers (as also in
VIII.96.14) it refers to eddies, the circular or oval shapes produced against the
current by uneven flow &ndash; or to the “oxbows” or “meanders” created in a river’s
course by such uneven flow (Google images are quite striking). In other geographical
contexts it can refer to byways, detours from the straight path, and ultimately to
remote places, the backeddies, as it were, of the mountains.</p>
<h3 id="i627">I.62.7</h3>
<p>Nodhas continues to deploy his tricks in this verse. He has moved on from the
obscure four-river reference in the preceding verse, to a more standard domain for
Indra to display his power: the two world halves. But in the first hemistich Indra is
not depicted as filling them or propping them apart or any of his usual actions with
regard to them, but rather as “uncovering” them, using the same lexeme ví √vṛ as
was just used in a Vala-myth verse (5a ví var, 7a ví vavre). (That lexeme is close to
being the signature Vala verb, though it is actually more commonly ápa √vṛ, with the
same sense, but a different preverb.) Notice that the two occurrences of ví √vṛ
surround the pseudo-omphalos verse 6, in the usual manner in which concentric
lexical rings signal an omphalos. So Nodhas thus presents this new mythological
theme as if it were the old one, the Vala myth found in vss. 2-5, though he is entering
different mythological territory.
He also reuses the √ṛc lexical theme from vss. 1–2, with arkaíḥ in b, which is
apparently qualified by the middle participle stávamānebhiḥ (remember stuvatá in
1c). This participle is somewhat disturbing; like all middle participles to the root
√stu, it is used passively here, but unlike all the other passive uses, its subject is not
the god praised but the praises themselves. It may be that Nodhas want his audience
to take notice of such an aberrant usage. However, I am tempted to read
*stavamānaibhíḥ here – that is, nom. sg. stávamānas + pron. ebhíḥ, with rare double
application of sandhi: -as + e- &gt; -a + e- &gt; -ai-. The participle stávamānas would
modify Indra, as would be expected; ebhíḥ occurs several times with arkaíḥ (IV.3.15,
10.13) and the passive of √stu also appears with this instr. (see passages adduced by
Ge in n. 7b, where he suggests a similar, but far from identical, reanalysis of the form
in the text, calling it “vielleicht Hypallage”). If the emendation is accepted, I would
change the tr. to “the irrepressible one being praised by these chants.” The arkaíḥ
might also be construed secondarily as it currently is in the tr., with ví vavre, as the
instrument with which he performed the uncovering.
ayā́sya- regularly qualifies Indra; there is no reason to take it as a personal
name, identifying a distinct second figure here (pace Ge, Re).
95
Phonetic figure: sanájā sánīḷe taking up the sa’s in vs. 4 and prefiguring the
sa’s that will be conspicuous in the next few verses.
The second hemistich contains a clever pun between simile and frame. In the
frame (pāda d) Indra supported, that is, held up, the two world halves in familiar
fashion (somewhat repairing the less standard uncovering he performed in ab, though
cf. VIII.96.16). In this task he is compared to the god Bhaga (though it is not an
activity that I think of as particularly associated with Bhaga). But in the simile
bhága- is used as a common noun ‘(good) portion’, which provides support for two
consorts (méne) – the point presumably being that a man needs a particularly large
portion of property to support two wives. I do not follow Hoffmann’s view (1960:
245; KZ 76) that méne here is an elliptical dual referring to concubine and lawful
wife, and in fact believe that ménā in general has a wider sense than he allows. He
restricts it to concubines, but the derivation from √mi ‘exchange’ suggests a wider
application, with the wife as an “exchange token” in the economic transaction of
marriage.</p>
<h3 id="i628">I.62.8</h3>
<p>From the spatial dual females of vs. 7 Nodhas now moves to the temporal:
night and dawn, also dual females, whose activities have kept occurring “from of old”
(sanā́t), linking them lexically to the two world-halves of 7a who were born of old
(sanájā).
In dívam pári bhū́mā we encounter the not-quite-dvandva also met in 61.14;
there in dyā́vā ca bhū́mā, dyā́vā was definitely dual, but its partner bhū́mā was either
singular (with lengthened final) or plural. Here dívam is definitely singular, with
bhū́mā either of the choices just given, probably singular.
punarbhū́- later (already in the AV) has a specialized legal application as a
designation for a remarried widow (see Thieme Kl.Sch. 445-60 = KZ 78, 1963), but
this sense does not seem to be in play here or in the other RV passages.
Though most take aktā́(which only appears here) as the ppl. of √añj ‘anoint’,
serving as a poetic designation for ‘night’, I favor a root connection with the ‘night’
word, with zero-grade in the root syllable, esp. since aktú- ‘night’ is probably so
connected (pace EWA s.v.). See EWA s.v. and AiG III.234, though both are
skeptical. Of course secondary association with √añj would be natural.
JL notes the chiasmic kṛṣṇébhir aktā́-uṣā́rúśadbhiḥ of c; for a similar
chiasmus see 11c.
JTK suggests that vápus- here and in other dawn/night passages refers to
bridal clothing and suggests a tr. ‘finery’.</p>
<h3 id="i629">I.62.9</h3>
<p>Although the first hemistich is perfectly easy to tr., it is not at all clear what it
is referring to. First, what is the “partnership” (sakhyám)? Ge thinks it is with the
beings named in vss. 7-11, while Sāy thinks rather of the sacrificers. Nothing in the
context helps to define what type of partnership it is or with whom, and the verb that
governs it, “supported” (dādhāra), seems oddly chosen. The subject of this verb is
also not fully identified: the larger context of course points to Indra, and sudáṃsāḥ
‘possessing very wondrous power’ was just used in 7c of Indra (where he was
96
likewise the subject of a form of √dhṛ), and see dáṃsaḥ applied to his deed in 6b.
But who is he the “son” (sūnú-) of? and more to the point, the epithet śávasaḥ sūnúḥ
“son of strength” is ordinarily Agni’s. Here we have the variant sūnúḥ … śávasā
with instr., and sūnúḥ śávasā is used of Agni in I.27.2. On the other hand, śavasānáis twice use of Indra in the beginning of this hymn (1a, 2b) and śavasāvan in 11d,
śavasāna in 13c; cf. also the clear śávasaḥ sūnúm índram in IV.24.1. I tentatively
suggest that there is an attempt to blur the lines between Indra and Agni here, and
that the partnership or fellowship may be the mutually beneficial relationship
between gods and men centered on the sacrifice, where Agni officiates. But I cannot
point to hard evidence for this interpretation.
The paradox of the cooked milk in the raw cows is a standard one, often
trotted out as a natural wonder to contemplate. Here it seems to be taken further:
there are literal milk and literal cows in c, but in d the black and red cows are likely
to be the nights and dawns (as in 8cd) and the “gleaming white milk” the early light
known as the “milk of the dawn cows” (see Watkins MoreDawnCows). As far as I
can see, this hemistich has no integral connection with the first half of the verse, and
the shift from 3rd to 2nd person underlines this disconnect.</p>
<h3 id="i6210">I.62.10</h3>
<p>A nicely balanced alliterative pāda sanā́t sánīḷā avánīr avātā́, with the first
phrase picking up 7a sanájā sánīḷe. Note also that the first word of b, vratā́, echoes
avātā́. On avātá- see comm. ad I.38.7 and VIII.79.7.
Again the reference of this verse is somewhat obscure. Are the streams here
the same as the four rivers in 6cd? or are they the streams released from Vṛtra’s
confinement? (Ge suggests sensibly that Indra gave them the command to wander in
I.61.12, though it is their own commandments, not Indra’s, that they safeguard here.)
The identity of the sisters of cd, compared to wives, is even less clear. Are they the
same streams as ab? or possibly praise-songs (gíraḥ appear with the same simile,
jánayo ná pátnīḥ in I.186.7, and in our next vs., 11cd, “inspired thoughts” [manīṣā́ḥ]
are compared to eager wives). Again, I think the reference is supposed to be shifting,
with the literal streams of mythological time replaced by the thoughts and praises of
the ritual here-and-now, mediated by the feminine gender of the words used of both
streams and praises. The temporal shift in this part of the hymn, or rather the double
temporal vision, is signalled by the repeated initial sanā́t ‘from of old’ and related
terms (8a, 10a, 11a, 12a, 13a) and its contrast with the present tense verbs that
prevail in this section.</p>
<h3 id="i6211">I.62.11</h3>
<p>sanāyú- ‘age-old’ is found only here, and was clearly created to match the
other pāda-initial sanā- ‘old’ forms in this section, while matching its nom. pl.
sanāyúvo with vasūyávo, which opens the next pāda. JL suggests that part of the
motivation for creating this particular hapax is to invoke the paradoxical
juxtaposition of sana- ‘old’ and yuvan- ‘youth’. Verse 8 contains the same
juxtaposition: sanā́t … yuvatī́“from of old the two young girls,” and the theme of old
and new runs throughout this hymn, indeed in this verse.
JL also notes the chiasmic pátiṃ ná pátnīr uśatī́r uśántam of c.
97</p>
<h3 id="i6213">I.62.13</h3>
<p>sanāyánt- is likewise only here. Note its semantic opposite návyam at the
end of the pāda, the same contrast as sanāyúvo … návyo in 11a.
Like the last verse of the preceding hymn (I.61.16), this verse is extra-hymnic
in some ways, but also has connections with the rest of the hymn. The “old” pattern
continues to open the verse, and the voc. śavasāna in c forms a ring with the same
stem in the dative in 1a.</p>
<h2 id="i63-indra">I.63 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="i631">I.63.1</h3>
<p>The very first hemistich of this hymn presents us with a syntactic problem:
although the most natural way to read this is with a rel. clause beginning with yó ha
and continuing through the second pāda, the verb there, dhāḥ, is unaccented. There
are three possible ways to handle this. The first, the one I followed in the publ. tr., is
to assume that dhāḥ got de-accented for some reason. Several possible reasons are
available, though none of them strong: 1) it lost its accent redactionally from being
matched to (properly) unaccented dhāt in 2b, also at the end of its hemistich; 2) the
same idiom áme (…) dhāt is found in nearby I.67.3 (unfortunately by a different
poet) and this caused the loss of accent redactionally; 3) because the 2nd hemistich of
the verse in question is also a subordinate clause (beginning yád dha), the previous
subordinate clause lost its verbal accent and became a kind of “honorary” main
clause, because the action of cd is based on that of the relative clause that precedes it.
(This seems to be one possibility that Old floats, though he is rather sketchy about it.)
Though Ge does not mention the lack of accent, he tr. the whole as a rel clause.
The other two ways to deal with the problem involve having the rel. clause
end at the end of the first pāda. Old also suggested the possibility that the rel. cl. is
limited to yó ha śúṣmaiḥ. Re, Hoffmann (1967: 181), and WG all follow this path,
with tr. of the type “You are great, Indra, who are (so) because of your śúṣma.” I
rejected that because of its awkwardness, although I recognized that it solves the
accentless verb problem, since the main clause can occupy pāda b without problem.
A third way, also ending the relative clause with the end of the first pāda, seems to
me to be less clumsy, and that is to make all of the first pāda the relative clause.
Though yáḥ appears to be fairly far into that clause, in fact it is not preceded by more
than one constituent (plus a vocative, which doesn’t count). This produces a tr.
“(you) who are great because of your śúṣma-, you placed ….” This actually has a
parallel in IV.22.3 yó deváḥ …, mahó vā́jebhir mahádbhiś ca śúṣmaiḥ “The god who
… is great by reason of his prizes and his great śúṣma.” I would therefore now
change the tr. accordingly, to this third option.
The next problem in this half verse is the construction of áme √dhā. All the
standard tr. render it more or less as “you put Heaven and Earth in panic/fear.” This
makes sense of the syntax, but attenuates the meaning of the noun: áma- is an attack
or onslaught, or more abstractly offensive power, whereas ‘panic, fear’ suggests the
opposite. Therefore, although slightly more machinery is required, I tr. this idiom
(found also in I.67.3, IV.17.7) as “put X in the path/way of your onslaught.”
98
Notice that here Nodhas manages to deploy a perfectly orthodox de-coupled
dual dvandva for Heaven and Earth (dyā́vā … pṛthivī́). See remarks on I.61.14, 62.8.
The subject NP(s) of cd are neatly interwoven: with víśvā … ábhvā (neut.)
chained with giráyaś cid … dṛḷḥā́saḥ (masc.).
Hoffmann (p. 181) argues convincingly that naíjan should not be interpreted
as ná aíjan with the Pp., but with the injunctive éjan.</p>
<h3 id="i632">I.63.2</h3>
<p>If my new parsing of the syntax of vs. 1 is correct, these two verses are
structurally parallel, with a relative/subordinate clause in a, the main clause in b, and
a further subordinate clause, esp. dependent on the main clause, in cd.
Note the phonological trick, where (ā́) yád dhá(rī) opens 2a, apparently
matching yád dha of 1c (which in turn shows dha for ha, found in the grammatically
different rel. clause yó ha in 1a). The verse ends with more alliteration: d púra(ḥ)&hellip;
puru- &hellip; pūrvī́ḥ.
The meaning of vívrata-, several times of Indra’s horses, but also with a few
other referents, isn’t entirely clear, because it depends on which of the many value of
ví to assume. I favor ‘having separate commandments’, that is, acting independently
but each in obedience to Indra, but it could also mean ‘without commandments’
(which must underlie Ge’s ‘widerspenstige’ [stubborn], followed by Hoffmann [but
with ?]).
The c pāda lacks a caesura and in its place has a somewhat bizarre compound,
voc. aviharyata-kratu-. The second member is clear, and the whole must be a
bahuvrīhi. The first member appears to contain the well-attested adj. haryatá-
‘gladdening’, but this presents certain problems: the present háryati does not appear
with the preverb ví and it is difficult to construct an appropriate meaning, esp. one
that would harmonize with krátu- ‘resolve’. Possibly, with double negation via a + ví,
“whose resolve is not undelightful” – not a particularly compelling possibility.
Nonetheless, this derivation seems the path of least resistance and is probably
responsible for Ge’s “dessen Rat nicht verschmäht wird” and WG’s “… nicht
unbeliebt ist” (possibly also Hoffmann’s “… nicht zu unterschätzen ist” – it’s hard to
tell). But all of these must take the -haryata- in a passive sense, although the simplex
adjective never has that value.
I think it’s likely that the compound involves some complex word play,
scrambling and recombining the (d)hárī and ví(vratā) of pāda a. Despite the ad hoc
explanations required, I’m inclined to consider the -viharyata- somehow a derivative
of ví √hvṛ ‘deflect, swerve, overturn’, a well-established idiom. (Re’s “dont le
pouvoir est incontrariable” seems to reflect this.) Two negated nominal derivatives of
this lexeme are found in the RV: ávihruta- ‘unswerving’, jpb: ‘not overturned’
(V.66.2, X.170.1) and ávihvarant- jpb: ‘not overturning’ (IV.36.2). Unfortunately the
morphological details are not going to be easy. Accounting for the loss of the v in a
putative *avihvaryata- is not so difficult: it can be ascribed to dissimilation, in
combination with the word play on (d)hárī just mentioned. But what about the rest of
the word. For the suffix -ata- I can only invoke the (small) class of -ata- adjectives
with full-grade root syllable of the type darśatá- ‘(lovely) to be seen’, yajatá-
99
‘worthy of the sacrifice’, and the aforementioned haryatá- ‘delightful’. As for the
intermediate -y- between root syllable and ending, I again invoke the play on (d)hárī,
with the -y- representing the sandhi of -ī- before the suffix -ata-. If word play is
indeed involved here, it’s possible that a second reading of the first member could be
“not without his fallow bays” and the whole compound means “who has no resolve
without his fallow bays.”
I am fully aware of what a house of cards this is and only sketch these
scenarios because I think Nodhas is capable of such manipulations. I do think it
possible, however, that the lack of caesura and the problematic compound are
connected and that the transmitted text is not what Nodhas originally composed. It
should be noted that the word division yénā viharyatakrato is also a possibility, but
this doesn’t help either with the lack of caesura or the analysis of the compound.</p>

<p>I interpret dhṛṣṇúḥ as governing the acc. etā́n, though as a goal not a direct
object..
I.63.4–7: tváṃ ha tyád provides the opening of the next four verses. Although tyád is
a neut. pronoun and in 4a could function as the object of the otherwise object-less
codīḥ, in the following verses it does not have pronominal function; the expression X
ha tyád is a way of providing emphasis, particular of the 2nd ps. pronoun (cf., e.g.,
VII.19.2, VIII.96.16–18). I would now be inclined to tr. the vss. in this sequence with
“It was just you who …” rather than the rather recessive “You then, …”</p>
<h3 id="i635">I.63.5</h3>
<p>This verse contains many small problems of interpretation that hinder putting
together the whole. I’ll start with the details and turn to the construction of the whole
thereafter.
áriṣaṇyan is universally taken as intrans., patient-oriented ‘not receiving harm,
not being harmed’, but in all cases this stem is better taken as ‘not allowing harm’.
The finite verb riṣaṇyáti also has this meaning “intends harm, allows harm’. The
parallel stem áriṣaṇya- in II.29.4 has the same meaning and takes a genitive
(áriṣaṇyā tanū́nām “not allowing harm to our bodies”), and I construe the gen.
mártānām in b with áriṣyan: “not intending harm to mortals.”
The next problem is dṛḷhásya. Ge takes this as the causer of the harm to Indra
(gen. agent), while Hoffmann, followed by WG, construe it with ájuṣṭau, with the
gen. pl. mártānām dependent on dṛḷhásya (KH “bei Missfallen selbst eines
Feststehenden unter den Sterblichen”), but both the Ge and the WG interpretations
require that dṛḷhá- be a person. This is unprecedented: this past participle is virtually
always used of a place, a fortified stronghold. Indra is once (VIII.44.12) called dṛḷhá-,
presumably because he is as steadfast as a fortress (in the vein of “a mighty fortress
is our god”), but I know of no examples with people so called. If at all possible it
should have the standard meaning here. I think this is possible, by reading the verb ví
… var of pāda c also with the first hemistich and supplying the word dúraḥ ‘doors’.
In fact, the other two passages containing the gen. sg. dṛḷhásya strongly support this
solution, as they both contain the verb ví √vṛ and the headnoun dúraḥ: VI.62.11
100
drḷ̥hásya cid gómato ví vrajásya, dúro vartam &hellip; “Open the doors of the cattle pen,
even though it is shut fast” and VII.79.4 ví dr̥ḷhásya dúro ádrer aurṇoḥ “you opened
up the doors of the firm-fixed stone.” Note that ví … var is rather more appropriate
to this hemistich than it is to the pāda in which it’s found. (Recall the double use of ví
√var in I.62.5 and 7.)
The last word to be accounted for in this hemistich is ájuṣṭau. Unlike most tr.
I take it to be Indra’s displeasure. The object of his displeasure is not expressed, but
it is easy to supply — presumably Vala, since Indra is opening up his stronghold. His
displeasure at Vala (or other demonic enemies) is implicitly contrasted with his
benevolent care not to injure mortals.
I am less sure about what pāda c is conveying. I assume this is a racing image:
Indra starts the race by opening the barriers at the starting line. Ge and Re take the
injunctive ví … var as a functional imperative, but this is certainly not necessary. I tr.
as a past tense, in keeping with its rendering in the first hemistich, but it would be
possible to take it as a present in c, as Hoffman/WG do. The phrase asmád ā́
“(coming) from us” seems a bit heavy simply to express that it’s our horse, so there
may be some racing terminology embedded here.
In d ghanéva contains the old instr. ghanā́. The same phrase is found in</p>

<p>and IX.97.16.</p>
<h3 id="i636">I.63.6</h3>
<p>The gerundive atasā́yya- is taken by Ge as belonging to √at ‘wander’ and tr.
“soll … erreichbar sein,” while most (Gr, Re (?), AiG II.2.286, Hoffman, WG) take it
to mean “to be asked for/begged” and derived from the hapax atasī́- supposedly
‘beggar’ (VIII.3.13). But this is entirely circular, with the meaning of each of these
two words determined on the basis of the other, with an occasional nod towards √at
‘wander’ as their possible root (whose relevance Mayrhofer casts doubts on; see
EWA s.v. atasī́-). I instead take it as a negated gerundive to √taṃs ‘tug, yank, shake’,
which forms a similar gerundive to its intensive, vitantasā́yya-. Negated gerundives
do not ordinarily take accent on the privative (AiG II.1.217), and the derivational
opacity of atasā́yya- would make it likely to receive the usual -ā́yya- gerundive
accent. Ge also suggests the possibility of derivation from √taṃs in a note.</p>
<h3 id="i637">I.63.7</h3>
<p>“one after the other” is my attempt to render an “object-distributive” value for
the intensive dardaḥ. (For this notion see Schaefer 1994: 86–87, though she
considers dardar- lexicalized and does not attribute this sense to it, pp. 135–36.)
The use of várg ‘you twisted’ differs in tone in simile and frame. In the frame
it is distinctly hostile and destructive, but in the simile it simply expresses the ritual
action of twisting the barhis grass into seats for the visiting gods.</p>
<h3 id="i638">I.63.8</h3>
<p>ā́paḥ in b can certainly be the old nominative plural used as an accusative, as
occasionally happens in late RV (so Gr and implicitly most tr.), but as I suggested
elsewhere (1982: 260), it may be the nominative plural it appears to be; this may be
an example of case disharmony in a simile, exploiting the ambiguities in syntax of
the verb √pi ‘swell’ that the poets were always happy to capitalize on. In the frame
101
pīpayaḥ is transitive (“you swell the refreshment”), but in the simile intransitive (“as
waters [swell]”).
I take tmánam as functioning as a reflexive pronoun (“extend yourself”),
while most tr. take it as a noun (Ge ‘Lebensgeist’, WG ‘Lebenshauch’). This is the
only acc. to the truncated stem tmán-, and so its usage is hard to determine. The
oblique cases (dominated by inst. tmánā) generally refer to the self (‘by yourself, for
ourselves’, etc.), without a full-blown nominal sense, which accounts for my tr.
However, the active form of yáṃsi gives my pause, and so the standard tr. should be
considered (though I am not ready to adopt it). “Extend nourishment to us” seems to
be formulaic, with an active form of √yam, and so that voice may have prevailed
here, despite the reflexive tmánam; cf. III.1.22 prá yaṃsi … íṣo nah, IV.32.7 sá no
yandhi … íṣam.</p>
<h3 id="i639">I.63.9</h3>
<p>I supply ‘hymn’ as subject for ákāri in the first pāda and take bráhmāṇy ùktā
in b as a separate nominal clause. It is of course grammatically possible to take the
latter phrase as subject of ákāri, since neuter plurals famously can take singular verbs.
But, fame aside, this construction is quite rare in the RV, and in this case there are
two different recipients, Indra in a and the horses in b. However, I do not consider
the other interpretation impossible.</p>
<h2 id="i64-maruts">I.64 Maruts</h2>
<h3 id="i641">I.64.1</h3>
<p>Ge argues that apó (apparently the acc. pl. of ‘waters&rsquo;) should be emended to
ápo (neut. acc. sg. of ‘work’). His parallels are persuasive, and I accept the
emendation. Therefore the published tr. should have an asterisk * before ‘work’. The
accent shift may have been made redactionally, on the basis of vs. 6, which contains
apó ‘waters’ in its first pāda and vidátheṣv ābhúvaḥ in its second, as here. On the
other hand, if we choose to retain the reading apó (see below), the hemistich can
mean “Wise in mind, with dextrous hands I anoint the hymns, like waters standing
ready at the rites.” WG accept the reading as given, but take it as “Werkmeister,” i.e.,
to the internally derived adjectival stem apás- ‘possessing work’. This would be
appealing save for the fact that the masc. nom. sg. should be *apā́s (or ápā in this
sandhi context). This morphological problem is not mentioned.</p>
<h3 id="i644">I.64.4</h3>
<p>vy àñjate here responds to sám añje in 1d, though here the verb is reflexive
and in the 1st vs. it is transitive but with subject involvement (“I ornament [my own]
hymns”). I tr. the verbs slightly differently because the ‘anoint’ sense doesn’t work
very well in vs. 1, esp. with the simile, whereas here the etymological figure with
añjíbhiḥ ‘unguents’ enforces the more literal sense.
Gr suggests emending mimṛkṣur ‘they rubbed’ to mimikṣur ‘they were
fixed/attached’ (accepted by WG), since this verb √myakṣ is used elsewhere of
spears in similar contexts. However, ‘rub’ makes fine sense, and the poet may well
be playing with a well-known phrase. (This perhaps should give us pause about
emending apó to ápo in 1.)

<p>Very alliterative verse, esp. in 2nd half, with pāda c duhánty ū́dhar divyā́ni
dhū́tayo (cf. also dhúnayo in pāda a) and d … pinvanti páyasā párijrayaḥ. Cf. also b
vā́tān vidyútas (ta)vi(ṣībhir).
Most tr. take ū́dhar divyā́ni together (e.g., Ge “die himmlischen Euter”).
Although divyá- does modify ū́dhar- elsewhere in similar context (e.g., IX.107.5
duhāná ū́dhar divyám mádhu priyám), the collocation is not grammatically possible
here, since ū́dhar is definitely singular and divyā́ni is definitely plural. At best one
would have to argue that short-vowel neut. plurals to n-stems, which are identical to
their neut. sgs., provided some sort of model (cf., e.g., I.173.3 sádma mitā́“fixed
seats”). Old (ZDMG 55.273 n. 1 [=KlSch 732]) claims that this is a vicarious
introduction (“ein vicarirendes Eintretung,” whatever that means) of the sg. ū́dhar
since the plural of ū́dhar- doesn&rsquo;t exist. (We would expect *ū́dhāni, like áhāni to áhar,
though Old bizarrely produces *ū́dhṝṇi instead; I see no reason why *ū́dhāni could
not exist and assume its non-attestation is an accidental gap.) But the issue here is not
the singular of ‘udder’, but the plural of ‘heavenly’, which the poet could easily have
made singular (as in the parallels) if he had wanted. The root √duh can take a double
accusative, as in IX.107.5 just quoted: “milking the heavenly udder of its dear
honey”), and this is how I interpret divyā́ni here, supplying a form of vásu ‘goods’,
which divyá- regularly modifies. In one way or another this alternative goes back to
Gr and Delbrück AiS.80 and is accepted by WG. Again, Nodhas seems to be
playfully evoking a familiar phrase but modifying it.

<p>vidátheṣv ābhúvaḥ, repeated, as noted above, from 1d, is ambiguous. It can

gíraḥ) and, if apó of pāda c is not emended, those waters as well.</p>

<p>piśá- in b occurs only here in the RV, so although the meaning assumed by
most (‘mottled [deer]’ vel sim., beginning with Sāy) is plausible, it has no other
support. The plethora of wild animals in this run of verses (7: buffalos, wild
elephants, 8: lions, snakes) does suggest that this term names animals too. Re by
contrast tr. the etymological phrase piśā́iva supíśaḥ as “bien ouvragés comme des
oeuvres-peintes,” though he is more cautious in his n. Kulikov (JIES: 2009) suggests
‘cheetah’ or ‘leopard’ on the basis of the wild animal company it keeps in its AV
occurrence (AVŚ XIX.49.4 = AVP XIV.8.4). This is plausible but by no means
certain.</p>
<h3 id="i649">I.64.9</h3>
<p>As noted in the intro., ródasī is a pun. In pāda a it refers to the two worldhalves, but in cd the unexpressed subject is feminine and mounts the Maruts’ chariot.
103
This can only be Rodasī, the Maruts’ consort (for mounting their chariot, see
I.167.5–6), who ordinarily is accented rodasī́but here must be generated by
otherwise homonymous ródasī in pāda a.
áhimanyavaḥ should probably be unaccented, in a voc. phrase with śūrāḥ, but
since the phrase śávasā́himanyavaḥ is exactly repeated from the preceding vs., 8d,
where it is properly nom., it could hardly have failed to acquire an accent
redactionally.</p>
<h3 id="i6410">I.64.10</h3>
<p>Properly speaking, the tr. should read “have taken their arrow in their fists,”
since íṣum is singular. With dual gábhastyoḥ the passage is shorthand for “(each) has
taken his arrow in his two fists.”</p>
<h3 id="i6411">I.64.11</h3>
<p>payovṛ́dh- has several possible values. In addition to the ‘milk-strong’ in the
publ. tr., it would also be possible to take the -vṛdh- transitively: “strengthening with
their milk [=rain]” or “strengthening the milk [=rain]”; either alternative is supported
by vss. 5–6.
The lexeme úd √han is quite rare and occurs with the verb stem jíghna- only
here. Since the exact sense of the lexeme is not certain, it is difficult to know how to
complete the simile. I have interpreted the verb to mean ‘beat up’; with regard to
roads there is a nice parallel in the English idiom “pound the pavement.” I assume
that ā́pathi- refers to walkers on a path and supply ‘road’ as the object parallel to the
mountains and their feet as the instrument of pounding that is parallel to the wheelrims. ET compares the French idiom ‘frayer le chemin’, used of blazing a trail,
which may well be the sense meant here. Ge takes the verb as ‘aufreissen’ (tear
open/up) and supplies ‘stones’ as the object (sim. WG). I am a little puzzled as to
why his Strassenfahrer would be tearing up stones, but I suppose it might be to clear
a rugged path. Re: “… arrachent les montagnes, tels des frayeurs-de-voie.” I do not
know what he means by this.</p>
<h3 id="i6412">I.64.12</h3>
<p>The word sūnú- ‘son’ in the singular takes one aback in a hymn devoted to
celebrating the very plural Maruts. It clearly refers to the ‘flock’ (gaṇá-) in pāda c,
but I have tr. ‘offspring’ to avoid the misleading “we hymn the son of Rudra…”</p>
<h3 id="i6413">I.64.13</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) construes āpṛ́chyaṃ krátum with ā́kṣeti, giving the latter the
meaning ‘possess’. But this Class II present means only ‘inhabit, dwell’ (as opposed
to Class I kṣáyati ‘rules over, owns’ to a different [synchronic] root √kṣi). Re clearly
recognizes the problem and tries to reconcile the meaning of the root present with its
construal with an object, producing the very odd “il habite une force-spirituelle
digne-d&rsquo;être-recherchée.” It seems preferable to me to take āpṛ́chyaṃ krátum with the
previous pāda and tr. ā́kṣeti púṣyati separately. The two verbs (admittedly without
the preverb ā́) form a fixed expression (I.83.3, V.37.4, VII.32.9). The position of the
preverb also does not favor construing the preceding accusative with ā́kṣeti: we
might then expect the preverb to begin the clause, though this argument is
considerably weakened by the fact that the pāda would begin *ā́āpṛ́chyam, in sandhi
104
ā́pṛ́chyam, and the separate preverb would be essentially lost. As for the sense of
bharate … āpṛ́chyaṃ krátum, I interpret it as what I think Re would call a “legère
zeugma.” The first two objects of bharate, vā́jam and dhánā, are both physical
objects that the subject carries from one place to another; the third proposed object is
a mental attitude. The English idiom “carries himself” and the English noun “bearing”
use ‘carry, bear’ in a similar sense, to refer to a person’s mental self-presentation,
and the middle voice of bharate would neatly fit such a value.</p>

<p>I.65.2–3: These verses contain 3rd pl. act. root aorists ánu gman (2b) and ánu … guḥ
(3b) to the associated roots √gam and √gā respectively, with no apparent difference
in semantics. Here one might almost invoke the much over-used explanation of
metrical convenience: both of these 3rd plurals are always (gman) or almost always
(guḥ) pāda-final, with the first “making position” with a preceding light syllable
(often ánu) and the latter not.</p>
<h3 id="i653">I.65.3</h3>
<p>The second half of this verse is very economically and ingeniously expressed.
First, the syntactic modes of simile and frame are entirely different. The frame
consists of a single noun, nominalized from an underlying verb (páriṣṭiḥ ‘enclosing’
&lt; pári √as ‘enclose’), with the object (Agni, an underlying objective genitive) to be
supplied from context (“the enclosing [of Agni]”). The simile contains both subject
and object in the appropriate cases (nom. dyaúḥ and [presumably] acc. bhū́ma) but no
verb, which must be generated from the noun páriṣṭiḥ (“as heaven [encloses] the
earth”), which in turn was generated from the underlying verb. Thus, the frame and
the simile are in syntactic complementary distribution – the former with a verb (or
verb substitute) but no overt nominal complements, the latter with nominal
complements but no overt verb. That the verb-y half is expressed nominally and the
noun-y half as if it contained a governing verb is a further bit of cleverness. This
syntactic skew produces case mismatch, with the nom. “heaven” of the simile
apparently compared to nom. “the enclosing” (páriṣṭir dyaúr ná), and, further, the
mismatch between the single (presumed) complement of the frame and the two overt
complements in the simile gives an impression almost of case disharmony of the type
treated in Jamison 1982, although in fact the objective gen. “of Agni” that must be
supplied matches the acc. object bhū́ma in the simile.
Or at least it matches bhū́ma acdg. to the standard renderings (Ge, Re, WG,
Lü, Varuṇa p. 590, and the publ. tr.). However, bhū́ma is a neuter and ambiguous as
to case, and heaven enclosing the earth does not strike me as a standard Vedic image
— though it slips easily into our round-earth cosmological worldview. Far more
commonly in Vedic heaven and earth together encompass something else (e.g.,
X.27.7, under an epithet) or fail to (II.16.3, again under an epithet), or they
themselves are encompassed (see the expressions quoted in Jamison 1998). For a
nicely balanced passage in which the two appear both as object and subject, see
nearby (but attributed to a different poet) I.61.8cd pári dyā́vāprthivī́jabhra urvī́,
105
nā́sya té mahimā́nam pári ṣṭaḥ “He held encircled broad heaven and earth; they did
not encompass his greatness.” I therefore now wonder if bhū́ma should be taken as a
nominative parallel to dyaúḥ, with an object to be supplied (“… as heaven [and] earth
[encompass X]”) or even if dyaúḥ … bhū́ma should be recombined into a dual
dvandva (cf. dyā́vā-bhūmī́, with slightly different 2nd member) and taken as an object
(“as [X encompasses] heaven [and] earth”). (Note that the disyllabic reading of
di
yaúḥ could accommodate a dyā́vā.) In any case, I believe that the poet kept these
possibilities open by the ambiguous concision of his wording.
Yet another aspect of this little expression is its relation to other such
expressions in this small group of hymns attributed to Parāśara Śāktya (I.65-73):
twice elsewhere in this collection Agni is depicted as encompassing something else,
with the lexemes pári √bhū (I.68.2 pári … bhúvat, I.69.2 pári … babhūtha), while in</p>
<h3 id="i722">I.72.2</h3>
<p>something else is enclosing Agni, configured as a calf (vátsaṃ), using pári √as.
(I wonder if the somewhat pleonastic presence of bhúvat in our passage is meant to
resonate with those pári √bhū passages.) Thus, though in our passage Agni is clearly
the object of enclosure in the myth of his hiding in the waters, he himself can take the
role of encloser in this tight-knit collection – allowing for the possibility that he
might here be supplied as subjective genitive with páriṣṭiḥ, save for the mythological
context.
All in all, I.65.3cd packs a lot into its ten syllables and five words, as
witnessed by the many more words (more than ten times as many) in this entry
required to describe its syntactic and semantic tricks.</p>
<h3 id="i654">I.65.4</h3>
<p>The initial sequence in this vs. várdhantīm can, uncontroversially, consist of
the 3rd pl. act. pres. várdhanti and the enclitic pronoun īm, as the Pp. and all
subsequent analyses take it. I wonder, however, if it should not be analyzed like
nearby I.67.4 vidántīm (q.v.; also a Parāśara hymn), where I segment the sequence as
vidánt īm, with the old secondary ending *-ant preserved because it was misanalyzed
as -ánti + īm. In I.67.4 there is stronger motivation to accept my reanalysis because
vidá- is otherwise only an aorist stem and should not have indicative forms with
primary endings. Here, of course, várdha- is a present stem and várdhanti would be
perfectly at home. Nonetheless, the first four vss. of this hymn treat the
disappearance of Agni and his concealment in the waters and are couched in the past
&ndash; note esp. ánu guḥ ‘they followed’ in 3a, the vs. paired with this one. I would
therefore tentatively emend the published tr. to “the waters strengthened the lovely
child.” For this and other such passages (esp. I.65.4 and I.85.11), see my “Hidden in
Plain Sight: Some Older Verb Endings in the Rig Veda” in a forthcoming festschrift.
It is unclear with what part of the sentence the instr. panvā́ should be
construed. I take it with the verb várdhant(i) (though I do not go as far as Old, who
suggests that the phrase is equivalent to panáyanti), while Ge (/WG) and Re, in
slightly different ways, take it with súśiśvim. The stem is a hapax and there is no
obvious way to decide the matter, though the passages Re adduces for his instr. of
characterization (IX.85.11, 86.31 śíśum .. pánipnatam and III.1.13 apā́ṃ gárbham …
pániṣṭhaṃ jātám) may tip the scales in his direction. So I might modify the publ. tr.
106
to “The waters strengthen(ed) the lovely child in his wonder” or (see below) “…
strengthen(ed) the one growing well with/in wonder,” though construing it with
várdhant(i) still seems to yield more sense.
The matter is made more difficult by the fact that súśiśvi- is also a hapax. It is
generally taken as an adj. “schön wachsend” (ultimately to √śū ‘swell’), and this is
certainly possible. But because of śíśvā, instr. of śíśu- ‘child’, in 10c, I follow Old
(SBE, “the fine child”) and Re (“le beau Nouveau-né”) in taking it as a noun.</p>
<h3 id="i655">I.65.5</h3>
<p>It is tempting to take the adjectives raṇvā́, pṛthvī́, and śambhú as referring to
Agni and specifying the term of comparison with the item in the simile (“broad like a
place of peaceful dwelling,” etc.), and in fact Ge (mostly) and Re (entirely) give in to
this temptation. However, all three adjectives agree in gender with the noun in the
simile (fem. in the first two, neut. in the last), and although it would be possible to
explain this agreement as “attraction” (so Re), a simpler solution is to assume that the
adjective belongs with the comparandum. (So also WG.) The phrase girír ná bhújma
poses a different problem, in that girí- is masc., and therefore if bhujmá is an
adjective, it does not modify giríḥ — unlike the otherwise entirely parallel
expression in VIII.50.2 (Vālakh.) girír ná bhujmā́. We should either emend the text
(à bhujmā́, so Gr) to agree with that passage (“like a beneficial mountain”) or take it
as a nominalized neut. “source of benefit,” the solution adopted in the publ. tr. On
this characteristic of mountains, see, e.g., I.55.3.
I.65.6–7: The similes continue in these verses, but with less strict parallelism in
structure.</p>
<h3 id="i656">I.65.6</h3>
<p>The construction of síndhur ná kṣódaḥ is clarified by its occurrences in the
next hymn, I.66.10 síndhur ná kṣódaḥ prá nī́cīr ainot “Like a river its gush, he has
sent forth those [=butter offerings?] heading downward.” Hence the “(sending)”
supplied here.</p>
<h3 id="i657">I.65.7</h3>
<p>íbhya- is found only here in the RV, though it occurs later. It is a derivative of
íbha-, which is slightly better attested in the RV and seems to mean ‘(group of)
servants, retinue’. Tr. of íbhyān split dramatically between ‘wealthy’ (Ge “die
Reichen,” WG “die Begüterten”) and ‘vassal, servant’ (Re “les vassaux”), and the
Pāli cognate ibbha- is also glossed with both, though with the ‘vassal’ sense first and
dominant (see the newest ed. of the PTS dictionary, 2001 s.v.: “a member of a king’s
entourage; a vassal; dependent; wealthy”). I will not enter into a reexamination of all
the Sanskrit and MIA evidence, but in my opinion context here favors ‘vassal,
dependent’ rather than ‘wealthy’. See Proferes’s disc. of vss. 7–9 (2007: 111–12);
although he refuses to tr. íbhyān, he argues that it refers “to those who are
subordinated to the king,” quite possibly the clans — as the AV passage he adduces
suggests: AV IV.22.7 víśo addhi “eat the clans,” addressed to the king at his
consecration.
107</p>
<h3 id="i659">I.65.9</h3>
<p>Strictly speaking, given the position of ná, the apsú should go with the frame,
not the simile: “he hisses in the waters, like …” This is presumably a reference both
to the myth of Agni’s hiding in the waters treated earlier in the hymn and to his
identification with Apām Napāt, but the haṃsá- is surely sitting in the waters, too –
though the primary point of comparison is the hissing noise both make.
How to construe gen. viśā́m is not clear. I take it loosely as a datival gen. with
the cétiṣṭhaḥ, while Re considers it dependent on a “virtual” viśpáti- (“le plus
remarquable … de (ceux qui président aux) tribus”), and Ge and WG, in slightly
different ways, take it as dependent on uṣarbhúd (Ge “der Frühwache der
Ansiedelungen”; WG “der von Niederlassungen am Morgen wach wird”). Proferes’s
rendering is quite awkward, but closest to my own in intent: “the clans' brightest as
concerns strategems.”</p>
<h3 id="i6510">I.65.10</h3>
<p>The simile in cd is unclear; its purport depends on what meaning is assigned
to multivalent vibhú-, whose senses include ‘conspicuous’, ‘distinguished’, and
‘wide-ranging’, to which Ge adds ‘sich mehrend’, Re ‘abondant’, and WG ‘kräftig’.
In Ge’s and Re’s readings, the point of the simile would be the size of the herd and
its growth through the birth of its young. This is certainly possible, and the point of
contact with Agni would be the growth, that is, the blazing up, of the fire after its
kindling. However, I do not see ‘increase’ as one of the core meanings of ví √bhū
and prefer ‘wide-ranging’ here, with the simile expressing the grazing behavior of
herds and the frame the fire’s tendency to spread. See 8b vánā vy ásthāt “he has
spread out through the wood.” The final word of 10, dūrébhāḥ ‘far-radiant’, may
support this interpretation. I do admit, however, that śíśvā ‘with their young’ makes
less sense than in the Ge/Re interpretation.
Note that the opening of the last hemistich of the hymn, paśúr ná śī́śvā,
“unpacks” the hymn’s first word paśvā́in a type of ring comp., and that this phrase
was in a sense anticipated by 4b panvā́súśiśvim.</p>
<h2 id="i66-agni">I.66 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="i661">I.66.1</h3>
<p>The fem. gender of citrā́is a problem. The standard solution (see, e.g., Gr) is
to assume that rayí-, which is normally masc., is occasionally fem. (so also,
supposedly, in nearby I.68.7, though see disc. there). I find this unsatisfactory and
explain the gender by assuming that citrā́modifies not only rayíḥ but also fem.
saṃdṛ́k and agrees with the latter.
Gr takes sū́raḥ as the nom. sg. of the thematic stem sū́ra-; in this he is
apparently followed by Re: “(propre à la) vision (des hommes) comme le soleil.” I
find this unlikely, since saṃdṛ́ś- regularly takes the gen., incl. sū́ryasya (II.33.1,
X.37.6, X.59.5). I therefore take sū́raḥ as gen. of svàr-, with, apparently, Ge (/WG).
More problematic is ā́yur ná prāṇáḥ, where the first word should be the neut.
noun ā́yus- ‘lifetime’, since Gr’s supposed adjectival stem ā́yu- ‘beweglich’ does not
exist (only the neut. noun ā́yu-, also ‘lifetime’). Thus, properly speaking, we should
have an equational simile “breath like lifetime,” represented in Re’s “souffle-animé
108
comme la vie (même)” and WG “der Atem gleichsam als Leben.” Nonetheless I
consider the interpretation as an improper compound, as in Ge’s “wie der
Lebenshauch,” to make more sense.</p>
<h3 id="i662">I.66.2</h3>
<p>Both tákvan- and bhū́rṇi- have received diverse tr., which I will not treat in
detail here. For √tak as ‘plunge, rush’, etc., see EWA s.v. TAK; here and in takva-vī́-
I take it to refer to a “swooping” bird of prey. As for bhū́rni, it belongs to √bhur
‘quiver’, and I tr. it here as ‘restless’ to capture the constant circling and diving of
birds of prey. How then can he ‘cling’ (siṣakti) to the wood? The image must be of
the flames of the fire constantly licking and dancing (to use our preferred metaphors
in English), but always in contact with the wood. My “clings” is a more vivid version
of the literal “accompanies, keeps company with.” To avoid the appearance of
contradiction, the phrase might better have been rendered “ever restless, like a
swooping (bird), he (yet) clings to the wood.”
Note that the second syllable of vánā somewhat echoes the ná simile markers
of previous pādas.
The simile of c is syntactically problematic, consisting of a neut. NA sg.
páyaḥ ‘milk’ and a fem. nom. sg. dhenúḥ ‘milk-cow’, with the relation between them
unspecified. Ge simply takes it as a functional compound (“wie die Kuhmilch”),
though unlike “life-breath” in 1c, the order of the elements would be wrong; Re takes
dhenúḥ as if it were gen. (“comme le lait (de) la vache-laitière”), while Old (SBE)
and WG render it as two similes (Old “like milk, like a milch-cow”). I have supplied
a verb “(yielding),” allowing páyaḥ to serve as acc. object, on the basis of IV.57.2
dhenúr iva páyaḥ &hellip; dhukṣva. None of these solutions is immediately satisfying. One
clue might be whether the adjectives in d (śúcir vibhā́vā ‘blazing/gleaming and ‘farradiant’) are applicable to either the one or the other of the nouns in the simile, but
this doesn’t turn out to be very helpful. Although both adjectives are regularly used
of Agni, they are characteristic of neither milk nor cows. One exception is V.1.3
śúcir aṅkte śúcibhir góbhir agníḥ “blazing Agni is anointed with blazing cows,” but
there the “cows” stand for products of the cow, either milk (so the publ. tr.) or, more
likely, ghee, so that a metaphorical application to either noun is possible. And it may
be that the simile in c is to be taken by itself, detached from the adjectives in d; see,
e.g., 3cd, where the two pādas, one a simile, the other not, are semantically
independent.</p>
<h3 id="i663">I.66.3</h3>
<p>As Re notes, we might expect suffix-accented jetā́with gen. jánānām. WG,
following Tichy (1995: 343–44), interpret the gen. in datival function (“als Sieger für
die Menschen”) to avoid nominal rection with a root-accented agent noun. But since
this accentual “rule” is often broken, I see no problem with the standard interpr. as
objective gen. “conquerer of peoples.”</p>
<h3 id="i665">I.66.5</h3>
<p>The two halves of this verse are conceptually more complex than those
preceding. Most tr. take a and b as implicitly contrastive: Agni’s blaze is
undomesticated but he is nonetheless intimately familiar &ndash; e.g., Ge “Dessen Flamme
109
schwer heimisch wird, (und doch ist er) eingeboren wie die Einsicht.” This is
certainly possible. However, although I recognize the contrast between duróka- and
nítya-, I think the poet is equating the two elements in a clever play: Agni’s flame
can’t be controlled and “domesticated” anymore than a man in the grip of his own
will.
As for the second half, I find it hard to believe that the poet is implying that
one’s wife is at the disposition of everybody, with the distasteful sexual connotations
this implies &ndash; as in Re’s “(se mettent) à disposition pour chacun comme l’épouse sur
la couche.” Rather I think this is the Papageno situation: all it takes for anyone to be
happy is his own wife in his lap.</p>
<h3 id="i666">I.66.6</h3>
<p>The “horse” generally supplied with śvetáḥ ‘white’ is based on the regular cooccurrence of that adj. with áśva- and other expressions for ‘horse’, including
metaphorically of Agni (e.g., V.1.4). It of course also harmonizes nicely with the
chariot of cd.</p>
<h3 id="i667">I.66.7</h3>
<p>In the RV it’s necessary to allow sénā- to mean both ‘army’ and ‘weapon’;
although the latter could make sense here (so Re), an army is more likely to produce
an onslaught than a single weapon.</p>
<h3 id="i668">I.66.8</h3>
<p>As discussed in the publ. intro., this verse is quite opaque and breaks the
pattern of Agni-describing similes that has prevailed up to now in this hymn (and the
last one). It has, not surprisingly, stimulated much discussion and some fanciful
interpretations, all the details of which I will not rehearse here. The first question that
must be addressed is what the first word (and the fourth), yamáḥ, represents here. Is
it the PN Yama, naming the first man and the king of the dead? or the common noun
‘twin’? or even the common noun ‘controller’ (though we might then expect the
accent yáma-)? What one decides about this question determines the direction of
interpretation of the rest of the verse. Ge (/WG) take it as Yama, here identified with
Agni; Re and Old (and I) as ‘twin’, with the two twins displaying different
characteristics. The rhetorical structure of the verse favors this interpretation; not
only do the first two pādas both begin yamáḥ, a repetition that invites (but does not
require) a “the one … the other …” reading, but the contrastive characterizations
found in cd also support it.
The next problem is the gender discrepancy between jātáḥ (m.) and jánitvam
(n.) in what appear to be parallel equational clauses. To solve this Ge (/WG) simply
supply a verb with the second, to which jánitvam serves as object: “als Yama
(erzeugt er) das künftiges Geschlecht.” But this would disturb the balanced structure
of the verse, and it seems best to allow jánitvam to be predicated of yamáḥ, as Old
and Re (and I) do. Where I differ from these latter is in my interpretation of the two
equations. Old and Re take both twins to be identified with Agni, with each “twin”
representing one aspect of Agni’s nature. I think that each twin is identified first with
another entity, which is then secondarily identified with Agni. Although this might
seem complex, it allows the other parts of the verse to bear more meaning than the
110
exclusive “Agni = one twin, Agni = other twin” interpretation admits. As indicated in
the publ. intro., I take the verse as reflecting the circumstances of the early morning
ritual, when the fire is kindled at sunrise and the soma is pressed for the first offering.
Under that interpretation the twin that has (already) been born (jātáḥ) would be the
sun, at whose appearance the ceremony gets started. The twin that is the substance to
be born (jánitvam) would be the soma. The two are not only twins of each other, but
each is the twin of Agni. Soma and the sun are not infrequently identified (see, e.g.,
IX.66.18 tváṃ soma sū́ra éṣaḥ “you, Soma, are the sun”); the identification of Agni
and the sun is a commonplace; and Agni can also be identified with Soma (see, e.g.,
the tṛca IX.66.19–21), and they frequently share epithets (like śúci-, discussed above
2d, though in another context).
I then take the two pādas cd as referring to the sun and the soma respectively.
The sun is “the lover of girls” because he appears with the Dawns. For the same
phrase, in the acc., referring (most probably) to the sun, see I.152.4. Whereas in
IX.86.32 our same phrase pátir jánīnām is applied to Soma, where the
“women/wives” are the milk-drinks with which he is mixed. As for the secondary
reference to Agni, of these characterizations, either group of females (or both) might
refer to the offering ladles (fem. juhū́-) that approach the ritual fire with their
oblations or the streams (fem. dhā́rā-) of melted butter being offered. See the fem. pl.
nī́cīḥ in 10b.
Despite the complications of this interpretation, it provides a rich reading of
the enigmatic verse, which fits well with the two ritually centered verses that end the
hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i669">I.66.9</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., I consider the last two verses of the hymn to
reflect the ritual situation. This scenario is supported by the presence of 1st and 2nd
pronouns (vayám and vaḥ respectively), with the 2nd ps. enclitic indicating, as often,
the other human participants and observers besides the poet and priests, who are the
“we.”
The crux in this verse is carā́thā. The first problem with it is the long ā in the
2nd syllable, the only instance of such a stem in the transmitted RV beside regularly
formed carátha- (13x). However, the situation is more complex: 4 of the transmitted
carátha- forms occur in the Parāśara hymns (I.68.1, 70.3, 7, 72.6), but of these, 3
(68.1, 70.3, 7) would be metrically better if read *carā́tha-. I have no explanation for
the variation and will not pursue the issue further. More interesting is the
grammatical identity of the form and the semantic role it plays in the verse. Old
(SBE, Noten) and Ge (/WG) take it as a nom. pl. ‘wanderers’, neuter if flg. the Pp.,
though Ge suggests that it might reflect masc. carā́thāḥ. They further interpret it as
conjoined with vayám (Old, Ge) or identified with it (WG). However, in the Noten
(ad loc., fn. 1) Old allows the possibility that the form could be an instr. parallel with
vasatyā́(“mit Gehen und mit Verweilen”), an idea that Re develops, suggesting that
the pair are semantically parallel to the contrastive pair yóga / kṣéma (roughly
“activity and rest”). Re believes that the instrumentals characterize Agni (“(soit) dans
(sa) marche, (soit) dans (sa) demeure”). This is possible, though it would be a

slightly odd use of the instr. With Re I consider carā́thā an instr. contrasting with
vasatyā́, but think that the pair is applicable to “us”: we approach Agni with homage
with both our movable goods, that is, the livestock that provides the butter and milk
offerings, and our household establishment that supplies the rest.
The 3rd pl. nákṣante (nákṣanta in sandhi) does not agree with its 1st pl. subject
vayám. With Ge I take it as attraction to the immediately preceding simile, ástaṃ ná
gā́vaḥ. It is accented because it begins the pāda.</p>
<h3 id="i6610">I.66.10</h3>
<p>The fem. pl. nī́cīḥ has almost too many possible referents &ndash; waters, flames,
cows, or butter offerings (configured as cows) – all of which have been proposed by
one or more tr. I favor butter offerings. See also VIII.101.13, also containing nī́cī and
showing the same range of possibilities; sim. V.44.4. The cows of c may well be the
same offerings metaphorically.
See intro. for the ring compositional final pāda. As Re points out, svàr dṛ́śīke
is a nominalizing extension of the infinitive phrase svàr drś̥ é “to see the sun,” and we
need not try to interpret svàr as a genitive.</p>

<p>‘Demand’ may push √vṛ ‘choose’ a bit, but the simile suggests a degree of
coercion.
Adverbial ajuryám is lit. ‘undecaying, unaging’, but in the developed sense
‘unfailing’ or, in English idiomatic terms, ‘without fail’.</p>
<h3 id="i673">I.67.3</h3>
<p>On the idiom áme √dhā see disc. ad I.63.1; this expression must also be
considered in relation to Parāśara’s ámaṃ √dhā in the preceding hymn (I.66.7).
Although a tr. like WG “setzt er die Götter in Schrecken” is easier, I do not think we
should lose the sense of ‘onslaught’ for áma- by redefining it as ‘panic’ or ‘terror’ in
this idiom. Here I think the point is that the leaping flames of Agni put even the gods
in his way, even though he is, for the moment, sitting undetected. The first pāda of
the hymn (váneṣu jāyúḥ “a conquerer amid the wood”) also implicitly contrasts his
martial power with his apparently humble station.</p>
<h3 id="i674">I.67.4</h3>
<p>The anomalous 3rd pl. vidánti, to the thematic aorist ávidat, is the only
apparent primary indicative form to this stem and should belong to a present.
However, I think it can be eliminated: rather than following the Pp. vidánti īm, we
can instead read vidánt īm, an injunctive with secondary ending whose final -t was
preserved in this ambiguous sandhi situation. No alteration of the text is required.
The publ. tr. need not be altered either, though a preterital interpretation is in fact
better: “They found him there when they recited mantras…” – since this passage
appears to refer to the mythological tale of the gods finding Agni hidden in the
waters. Cf. I.72.2 (also a Parāśara product), where the immortals did not find him (ná
vindan) though they sought him; they are also described as dhiyaṃdhā́-, as here. For
112
this and other such passages (esp. I.65.4 and I.85.11), see my “Hidden in Plain Sight:
Some Older Verb Endings in the Rig Veda” in a forthcoming festschrift.</p>
<h3 id="i675">I.67.5</h3>
<p>Tr. of the subj. ajáḥ vary between ‘unborn’ (Ge, Re) and ‘goat’ (Old SBE,
WG), but parallel passages show that it must be the shadowy divinity Aja Ekapad
(“One-footed Aja”), whatever the ajá- signifies in that conjunction. (Old recognizes
as much in his n.) Cf. esp. AV XIII.1.6 tátra śiśriye &lsquo;já ékapādó &lsquo;dr̥ṃhad
dyā́vāprthiv ̥ ī bálena; also RV X.65.13 where ékapād ajáḥ is adjacent to divó dhartā́.
In our passage the word padá- appears in the next verse and gestures toward the
epithet.
The pf. dādhā́ra is ordinarily always presential (Kü 261); Kü cannot decide
whether the pf. of √stambh is presential or preterital, but at least in this context I
think it matches dadhā́ra in value.</p>
<h3 id="i676">I.67.6</h3>
<p>The verse is highly alliterative: ab: priyā́padā́ni, paśvó ní pāhi; d: guhā́
guháṃ gāḥ. For the stylistic figure guhā́guhám see Hoffmann, KZ 76 (1960) 242–48,
esp. 246–47 [=Aufs. I.113-19]. Note that guhā́has a different accentuation from
adverbial gúhā.
I.67.7–8: These two verses are syntactically dependent on each other, consisting of
three relative clauses (7ab, cd, 8ab) and a main clause with coreferential pronoun
(8cd). However, this structure is complicated by the fact that, though two of the rel.
clauses have singular rel. pronouns (yáḥ 71, 7c) and the pronoun in the main cl. is
likewise singular (asmai), the intermediate rel. cl. (8ab) has pl. yé, though all seem to
be roughly coreferential. There is no obvious solution for this jarring inconsistency;
Ge simply labels it Anakoluthon. However, certain features of the larger context may
have encouraged this syntactic anomaly. First, the relative/correlative construction is
of the indefinite “whoever …” type, where number is functionally, though not
grammatically, neutralized. That is, it doesn&rsquo;t matter how many (or few) people the
definitional relative clauses identify: if many people perform the functions, they
should all get the reward; if only one does, then only he would. Moreover, as Lüders
argues (p. 448), vss. 7–8 respond to vss. 3–4. In those earlier verses Agni goes into
hiding (3d), but the “superior men” (náraḥ) find him after they produce and recite
effective speech (4). In vss. 7–8 we seem to have the same situation, but in the
human realm: he/they who has/have recourse to and do(es) service to the truth (7cd,
8ab) and perceive(s) Agni in hiding (7ab) receive(s) acknowledgement from Agni
himself (8cd). Since in vss. 3–4 the discoverers of Agni, the gods, are plural, it may
be that the plural crept in here, too. And finally this sequence may anticipate the next
hymn, where it is emphasized that “all” (in the plural) perform the proper ritual and
devotional functions, and in particular the almost identical phrase ṛtáṃ sápantaḥ
(68.4c) echoes our ṛtā́sápantaḥ (67.8b).</p>
<h3 id="i678">I.67.8</h3>
<p>The verb ví … cṛntánti lacks an overt object, and several different ones have
been proposed: Ge (in n.) suggests it’s “the stream of truth” from 7d; Re supplies
113
“(l’énigme)”; and WG read ṛtā́with this verb as well as the participle sápantaḥ
(“welche … die Ṛtas aufknoten, (sie) pflegend”). Since the other two occurrences of
this root (impv. ví … cṛta I.25.21, ppl. vícṛtta-) are both construed with pā́śa- ‘fetter’,
that seems the likely object here as well. More speculatively, on the basis of VII.59.8
druháḥ pā́śān ‘fetters of deceit’, I have supplied that whole phrase here, since ‘deceit’
contrasts nicely with the emphasis on ṛtá- ‘truth’.
The pf. prá vavāca is one of the very few pf. forms to √vac with full
reduplication (against uvā́ca, etc.). On the basis of its agreement with Aves. vauuac-,
Kü (p. 441) considers this the older type of reduplication, with the newer type
spreading from Samprasāraṇa roots.</p>
<h3 id="i679">I.67.9</h3>
<p>The second half of the verse is metrically disturbed. As HvN note in their
metrical commentary, it actually reads better as a Triṣṭubh, as is occasionally the
case with Dvipadā Virāj.
The syntax of the verse is also problematic. The two utá-s of c are difficult to
construe, and partly for this reason Gr, Old (SBE [disavowed in Noten]), Re, and
Klein (DGRV 358) emend prajā́utá to prajā́su (presumably then *prajā́sūtá in the
Saṃhitā text, though it’s not stated). If the original text had read this, it is hard to see
why it would have become corrupted, given the two other loc. pl. in this verse. I
consider the problematic utá-s and the problematic prajā́ḥ connected and suggest that
the utá-s are connecting different entities: the first connects the nominatives yáḥ …
utá prajā́ḥ “who [Agni] and his offspring” (not grammatical in English, of course,
but possibly so in Skt; consider the common “X and which Y” construction), the
second the locatives vīrútsu … utá prasū́ṣu antáḥ “in the sprouts and within the
fruitful (plants).” Both Agni and his offspring grow in both media; note that because
of its sandhi position ródhan can be both sg. (ródhat) and pl. and thus construed with
both suggested subjects.
Note also that the verse begins ví REL, just like vs. 8, but with entirely
different referents for the rel. pronoun. This might be another reason why 8ab shifts
to the plural, to establish the difference between those who serve Agni and Agni
himself.</p>
<h3 id="i6710">I.67.10</h3>
<p>The exact sense of cittí- and the syntactic disposition of apā́m are the two
issues in this verse. Although cittí- ordinarily means ‘perception, insight’ and most tr.
so take it, I prefer to make it the abstract to a different, but well-represented, sense of
√cit, namely ‘appears’, hence ‘apparition’. I also, with Old SBE, take apā́m with
dáme rather than cittíḥ. I find tr. like “la pensée active des eaux” (Re), “der Verstand
der Wasser” (WG) hard to interpret, indeed even lacking sense. Since much of the
hymn has dealt with the theme of Agni’s hiding – and since his hiding place was the
waters, though this was not overtly stated earlier – I think that this verse describes
him glowing in the waters (and therefore detectible) and also makes reference to him
as Apām Napāt.
The sádma of c must be read with both simile and frame.

I consider these three hymns to be thematically and verbally linked, treating
the Vaiśvānara fire and encoding this theme by deploying the two words underlying
this vṛddhi compound, víśva- and nṛ́-. The first, víśva-, dominates I.68, the second,
nṛ́- I.69, and they are juxtaposed in the climactic verses of I.70.9–10. See the
introductions to the three hymns in the publ. tr., and for a detailed discussion,
Jamison, Fs. J. S. Klein (“Inter-hymnic Rhetorical Structure in Ṛgveda I.68-70:
Parāśara Śāktya’s Vaiśvānara Cycle,” 2016).</p>
<h2 id="i68-agni">I.68 Agni</h2>
<p>Note that Hoffmann tr. the entire hymn (1967: 141–42) because it contains 10
injunctives. I agree with Hoffmann’s tr. of these forms as presents, although I do not
think this requires a Zeitlos-type interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="i681">I.68.1</h3>
<p>For this interpr. of śrīṇán, which lacks overt object, see Narten 1987: 281
(=KlSch p. 351).
Rather than taking aktū́n as a second object with vy ū̀rṇot, I make it an acc. of
extent of time, as it often is elsewhere (e.g., V.54.4).
On the metrical shape of carátham see I.66.9.</p>
<h3 id="i682">I.68.2</h3>
<p>The second half-verse does not work as Dvipadā Virāj, since it would have
pādas of 4 and 6 syllables. It has long been suggested (for reff. see Old SBE and
HvN comm., both ad loc.) that putting devó devā́nām in the opposite order would fix
this problem. However, Old argues in the Proleg. (97) that this is unnecessary, that
Dvipadā Virāj has an affinity to Triṣṭubh, and that this line, though 10 syllables,
configures itself nearly as a Triṣṭubh. See I.67.9 above.
The verb pári … bhuvat lacks overt object, and various suggestions have been
made. I assume that its object is the same as the object of 1cd “the still and the
moving.” Hoffmann (sim. WG) tr. the verb simply as “überragt” (stands out), but this
interpr. ignores the emphasis on “encompassing” in this set of hymn (see disc. ad
I.65.3).
The unaccented gen. pl. eṣām presents a problem similar to that posed by
āsām in vs. 7, though I account for them in different ways. Given its lack of accent,
eṣām should be a pronominal, not adjectival, demonstrative, but it appears to be
construed with víśveṣām … devā́nām “of all these gods.” Because devā́nām is fairly
distant from both eṣām and víśveṣām and appears to be bound to immediately
preceding deváḥ, I would now take eṣām … víśveṣām together, separate from
devā́nām and emend the tr. to “When alone of all these, the god among the gods,
encompasses …” Though it may be difficult to maintain this in the face of vs. 7, as I
argue in the forthcoming article cited above, the poet is doling out the genitive
plurals here and does not want to specify that “these all” are the gods until the last
minute, since masc. pl. “all” in this hymn otherwise refers to the unified worshipers
of the Vaiśvānara fire.
115</p>
<h3 id="i684">I.68.4</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. has “All have a share in divinity and its name.” I would now
replace this with “… your divinity and your name.” As I argue in the art. cit., the “all”
literally share the name Vaiśvānara.
The contrast between the joint enterprise of those unified by the Vaiśvānara
fire, expressed by bhájanta víśve, and the separate actions of each of the members,
expressed by évaiḥ, is the theme of this verse as well as vs. 8.</p>
<h3 id="i685">I.68.5</h3>
<p>The logical and syntactic connections between the nominal expressions of ab
and the clause in cd are not clear. Ge simply pronounces ab elliptical and suggests
supplying cakruḥ from cd, while Re supplies “(telles sont/est)” with the two phrases.
My assumption is that the promptings and vision of truth are the indirect cause of the
actions in cd by defining the proper tasks that all should perform throughout their
lifetimes.</p>
<h3 id="i687">I.68.7</h3>
<p>There is a syntactic problem in cd that is ignored by all tr. as far as I can see,
though Old treats it briefly (ZDMG 61 [1907]: 829 = KlSch p. 260; see below): the
fem. gen. pl. demonstr. āsām is unaccented. Oblique forms of the ayám
demonstrative are unaccented when used pronominally, but accented when used
adjectivally. The two accented forms of āsā́m appear with NPs, pū́rvāsām …
svásṝṇām “previous sisters” I.124.9 and viśā́m .. ábhayānām “fearless clans” X.92.14,
and unaccented āsām (25x) is always pronominal (for VII.34.10 and X.75.4 see disc.
ad loc.) Yet all interpr. of our passage construe āsām with rayīṇā́m (e.g., Ge [/WG]
“der Herr dieser Reichtümer,” Re “le maître de ces richesses”). This produces
another anomaly: rayí- is overwhelmingly masculine and should not be modified by
a feminine demonstrative. (On supposed fem. rayí- in I.66.1 belonging to this group
of hymns, see disc. ad loc. It need not be, and in my opinion is not, feminine there
either.) Although it introduces some complexity, I therefore think that āsām “of these”
must stand for a different feminine noun also construed with páti-. The problem then
is what noun? It should already be present in the discourse, since unaccented forms
of ayám are anaphoric, but there are no obvious candidates – indeed, no candidates at
all if we limit ourselves to overt feminine plurals in the previous verses of this hymn.
However, an underlying feminine referent can be generated from the context. I see
two possibilities. 1) From ápatya- ‘progeny’ in the phrase mánor ápatye we can
generate the synonym, fem. prajā́- ‘offspring’ – note their juxtaposition in I.179.6
prajā́m ápatyam. The gen. pl. of prajā́- does not occur in Vedic (indeed no gen. pl. to
a root noun in -ā does; see Macdonell VG), presumably because it should be prajā́m
and identical to the acc. sg. (though with possible distracted 2nd syllable). By this
interpretation Agni would essentially be prajā́-pati. 2) More likely, in my view: the
underlying noun is víś- ‘clan’. Although no direct reference to clans is made in the
hymn, as I point out in the publ. intro. and argue in more detail elsewhere (Jamison
Klein Fs., 2016; see above), the repeated víśve ‘all’ triggers a pun with víś- in this set
of hymns (see esp. I.70.4) and so would be present in the minds of the poet and his
audience. Agni is regularly called viśā́m páti- and viśpáti-, sometimes at the same
time – e.g., III.13.5 hótāraṃ viśpátiṃ viśā́m, which also contains hótar-, as also here.
116
The mention of Manu might also have triggered the association; cf., e.g., V.4.3 viśā́ṃ
kavíṃ viśpátim mā́nuṣīnām “the poet of the clans, the clanlord of the (clans) of the
sons of Manu.” If this solution seems too fussy, it is possible to follow Old’s
explanation of the lack of accentuation (see ref. above): that āsām does not modify
rayīṇā́m but anticipates it (“he is the master of them, of the riches”), while being
anaphoric to sg. rayím in 6d. This does not eliminate the gender issue, however, and
also seems over-tricky. The eṣām … víśveṣām … devā́nām of vs. 2 makes some
problems for my interpretation here, but see discussion there.</p>
<h3 id="i688">I.68.8</h3>
<p>This verse has given rise to a number of different interpretations, which
cannot be discussed in detail here. I interpret it in the framework of Proferes’s
treatment of the joint clan-fire (see publ. intro.; also Fs. Klein), which must be
kindled and tended by members of the separate clans working together. This
cooperative and reciprocal enterprise is expressed by the phrase mithás tanū́ṣu
“mutually among themselves” (at least in my interpretation; it has received varying
tr., but with most rendering tanū́ṣu as ‘bodies’), by sáṃ jānata “they agree, act in
unison” to the resonant lexeme sám √jñā (see publ. intro. to I.68 and esp. I.68.9), and
by the middle voice of ichanta “they seek (from each other).” The rétaḥ they seek is,
I think, the means of kindling the fire, though I admit that this is not a usual sense of
that word. Again, as in 4cd, there is a contrast between joint action (sáṃ jānata) and
each individual’s contribution to it (svaír dákṣaiḥ).</p>
<h3 id="i689">I.68.9</h3>
<p>This verse returns us to vs. 3; the b-pādas of both are identical: krátuṃ juṣanta
“They take pleasure in your/his resolve.” In vs. 3 the subject is “all”; here we can
assume that the unidentified subject here is “all” as well, and, since vs. 8 follows
easily on vs. 7, we can superimpose “all” as subject there too. In vs. 3 the “all” found
this pleasure when Agni was born in cd; the parallelism between vs. 3 and vss. 8–9
supports my view that vs. 8 also concerns the kindling of the fire, and the birth
metaphor of 3cd (jániṣṭḥāḥ ‘you are born’) further supports my suggestion that the
rétaḥ ‘seed’ of 8a refers to the means of begetting the fire.</p>
<h3 id="i6810">I.68.10</h3>
<p>As Hoffmann points out, ví … aurṇot is the only augmented form in the
hymn and is esp. striking because it forms a ring with vy ū̀rṇot in 1d. The use of a
clear past tense form seems to me to mark the conclusion of the ritual kindling of
Agni and the attendant distribution of largesse. In other words, like so many final
verses it summarizes the ritual activity whose general description precedes it. The
final half-verse, in which Agni decorates the vault with stars, may seem out of place,
but it also forms a ring, thematic not lexical, with vs. 1, where Agni approaches
heaven and performs his tasks through the nights: the vault (nā́kam) reprises heaven
in 1ab, and the stars are appropriate to the nights.
Strictly speaking, rā́yaḥ is acc. pl., not gen. sg. (rāyáḥ), and a more literal
translation would follow Ge’s “Er schloss die Reichtümer, die Töre (dazu), auf,” or –
to match my tr. of 1cd and accommodate English idiom – “he disclosed riches,
opened wide (its) doors.” However, Old strenuously argues that it should be
117
interpreted as gen., and certainly the idiom rāyó dúraḥ (with the correct accent) is
found nearby in Parāśara’s oeuvre (I.72.8)
What exactly is meant by Agni’s decorating heaven with stars is unclear.
However, in a similar passage (IV.7.3) Proferes (p. 27) argues that the stars in the
sky represent the domestic fires distributed though many households.</p>
<h2 id="i69-agni">I.69 Agni</h2>
<p>As discussed in the publ. intro. and in the art. cit., this hymn is twinned with I.68.</p>
<h3 id="i691">I.69.1</h3>
<p>The etymological figure śukráḥ śuśukvā́n is not as redundant as it seems,
because both forms are found in similes with the sun — svàr ṇá śukrám (II.2.7,
IV.45.2) with the adjective and svàr ṇá śuśucīta (II.2.10, X.43.9) with the perfect —
both are found together in X.43.9 svàr ṇá śukráṃ śuśucīta. In other words, since the
similes &ldquo;like the lover of Dawn&rdquo; and “like the light of heaven” have the sun as their
underlying referent, at least one of the √śuc forms is, as it were, bound to it
formulaically.</p>
<h3 id="i692">I.69.2</h3>
<p>This verse is parallel to its twin in I.68, with the same verb: #pári …
babhūtha [/bhúvat 68.2]… ; the emphasis on Agni’s status among the gods (devó
devā́nāṃ 68.2, devā́nām pitā́69.2); and an instr. in -tvā (mahitvā́68.2, krátvā 69.2),
though to non-parallel stems (mahitvá-, krátu-). It is therefore surprising that tr. do
not note the parallelism of the two verses or necessarily treat them in the same way.
In particular, both Ge and Old (SBE) take the pári…bhúvat in 68.2 as ‘encompass’,
but pári … babhūtha in 69.2 as ‘be superior, excel’. (Re tr. both as ‘encompass’ and
WG both as ‘excel’.) Given the focus on encompassing/surrounding in this set of
hymns (see disc. ad I.65.3 above), I think both lexemes should be tr. the same way,
and each requires an object to be supplied. In 68.2 I supply “the still and the moving”
from the previous verse; here I would use the conjoined world-halves, also from the
previous verse.
The poet handles the parallelism between the two verses in almost a
syncopated fashion. As just noted, each verse contains the idiom pári √bhū; in 69.2
this is contained within the first hemistich, whereas the finite form bhúvat opens the
second hemistich in 68.2. But 69.2 has the almost identical form bhúvaḥ in that same
position, but not as part of the idiom (see also bhúvat I.67.2, 65.3). As Hoffmann
argues (e.g., 1967: 236–37), bhuvaḥ, bhuvat are formally ambiguous, both injunctive
to the thematic aorist and subjunctive to the root aorist of √bhū. In the publ. tr. I
render bhúvaḥ in I.69.2 as a subjunctive, but now I am inclined to take it as a
presential injunctive “you become…” parallel to my interpretation of bhúvat in 68.2.</p>
<h3 id="i694">I.69.4</h3>
<p>I supply mitráḥ ‘ally’ on the basis of a number of similar formulaic phrases:
jáne mitró ná X.22.1; mitráṃ ná jáne VIII.23.8 (of Agni); mitrá iva &hellip; jáne II.4.1 (of
Agni). This would be via the collocation mitrá śéva; cf. nearby I.58.6 mitráṃ ná
śévam divyā́ya jánmane “favorable like an ally to the divine race,” also of Agni, with
a different word for ‘people, race’ (cf. also śévam mitrā́ya X.113.5, a diff.
118
permutation). Note also, two hymns previously, I.67.1b márteṣu mitráḥ, where
márteṣu is a reasonable equivalent to jáne.
āhū́rya- is a hapax, universally taken to belong to √hvṛ ‘go crookedly, go
astray’; although this derivation is not impossible, it leads to some forced tr. (e.g., Ge
Durchgänger [‘bolter’, of horses]). I take it rather as the gerundive to the seṭ root √hṝ
‘be angry’.</p>
<h3 id="i695">I.69.5</h3>
<p>The phrase víśo ví tārīt is variously interpreted. The first issue it raises is
whether to take the acc. víśaḥ as direct object (so Ge, Re, WG) or to construe it with
the preverb ví as acc. of extent of space (Old SBE). Both usages are attested for ví
√tṝ, but it is worth noting that the latter usage is found in Parāśara’s oeuvre using the
same form ví tārīt (I.73.1), and I adopt it here. In the simile, “traverse the clans” may
refer to the year-long journey of the horse ultimately sacrificed in the Aśvamedha. In
the frame it reflects the idea of the Vaiśvānara fire spread through all the clans, not
limited to a single household or small family group.</p>
<h3 id="i696">I.69.6</h3>
<p>The intrusion of the 1st sg. speaker through áhve “I have summoned” is
remarkable. Who is he? Although ordinarily in the RV the default referent of a 1st ps.,
esp. a 1st sg., is the poet, I wonder in this instance if it is not the leader of the united
forces, the Kriegskönig, calling the clans and their leaders and best warriors to unite
them for action.
My tr. differs syntactically in several ways from most tr., though it agrees
with Re in both. First, I do not construe instr. nṛ́bhiḥ with sánīḷāḥ (“of the same nest
with the men”) but as an independent instr. of accompaniment. This would be the
only ex. of sánīḷa- with an instr. By specifying “the clans along with their men,” the
poet both refers to the whole social group and singles out its most conspicuous and
important members, perhaps the viśpáti-s.
Second, I take devatvā́as an instr. sg., not acc. pl. neut. with víśvāni. There
are several reasons for this. The first verse of the next hymn (I.70.1) contains the
same phrase víśvāny aśyāḥ, without further specification, and if at all possible the
two phrases should be rendered in the same way. Moreover, as Re points out, no
direct cases of the plural are attested in this type of derivative. It’s also the case that
Agni is characterized by instrumentals in -tvā in this group of hymns (mahitvā́I.67.9,
68.2; krátvā I.69.2), and his divinity is emphasized (I.68.2, 4, 69.2). I am, however,
given pause by several passages containing devatvám (sg.) √(n)aś: I.151.9 ná
devatvám paṇáyo nā́naśuḥ … and III.60.2 téna devatvám ṛbhavaḥ sám ānaśa.</p>
<h3 id="i698">I.69.8</h3>
<p>The first hemistich has 11 syllables and is best interpreted as a Triṣṭubh, with
HvN.
The verse is otherwise problematic, and my interpretation differs sharply
from that of others. The crucial point of difference is áhan, which is universally
taken as the 2nd sg. impf. of √han ‘smite’. This seems to me contextually very
unlikely: √han is a very rare verb with Agni as subject, and when it is found, it is
almost always of Agni’s special form as rakṣo-hán- (see IV.3.14, V.2.10, VI.16.29,
119
and with a different object V.4.5). The context does not favor a verb of violence, and
I find it hard to believe that √han would be attributed to Agni out of the blue, esp.
without specifying an object and esp. announcing this action as his particular
“wondrous power” (dáṃsaḥ). Instead I take it as the loc. sg. of áhar ‘day’, in the
formula samāné áhan “on the same day” (cf. I.34.3, 186.4), with the samāné
suggested by (or suppressed by) adjacent samānaíḥ. (Something like this possibility
is considered by Old in his n. in SBE and attributed to Aufrecht in Noten.)
The major argument against this interpr, as far as I can see, is the double yád,
which is unusual under any interpretation but passes better with two verbs (yád áhan
… yád … vivéḥ) than one. I do not have a good solution for this doubling. Either it is
rhetorical or simply pleonastic, or it marks off nṛ́bhiḥ … yuktáḥ as a quasi
circumstantial clause: “This is your wondrous power, that (yád 1) on the (same) day,
when (yád 2) yoked with the same men, you …” But I know of no parallels for such
a usage. Another argument for seeing √han here, made by Old (Noten), comes from
X.147.1, which contains both áhan and vivér apáḥ (see immed. below), but I do not
think that very late hymn, dedicated to Indra, should overly influence our
interpretation of this passage.
With Old (SBE and Noten) I read vivér ápāṃsi, against Pp. vivé rápāṃsi;
Old’s parallels are very persuasive, and this analysis does not require a change in the
Saṃhitā text. Ge’s tr. appears to follow the Pp. reading, however, as does Re’s,
though in his n. he accepts Old’s reading.</p>
<h3 id="i699">I.69.9</h3>
<p>The first pāda is identical to 1b and thus forms a ring.
Gr, Ge, Re (apparently), and Lub take usráḥ as gen. to uṣár-, but since there
exists a robust stem usrá- ‘ruddy’, I see no reason not to take it as nom. sg. to that
stem, esp. since vibhā́van- doesn’t otherwise take a gen.: the three passages Ge
adduces are not compelling.
As discussed in the publ. intro., I do not follow the standard interpr. of
sáṃjñāta-rūpa-, i.e., “having (his) well-known form,” since the idiom sám √jñā has a
quite specific meaning ‘come to agreement’. The idiom is distinctive enough, and the
compound is heavy enough, that that idiom is surely meant, esp. because it appears in
finite form in I.68.8. Instead of being an anodyne description of the fire, this is a
meaningful characterization of the shared clan-fire as the symbol of, and the product
of, the mutual and unified ritual activity of the clans. Unfortunately, to render this
comprehensibly in English requires a heavy and awkward locution.
The referent of asmai is not entirely apparent. The standard solution, going
back to Sāy, is that it is the sacrificer. This is basically correct. However, the lack of
accent on the pronoun should require that the referent is already present in the
discourse. I suggest that it is to be found in the 1st ps. subject of áhve “I have
summoned” in vs. 6, a subject that may be one of the ritual participants or, as
suggested above, the Kriegskönig. Switch between persons is of course extremely
common in the RV.
120</p>
<h3 id="i6910">I.69.10</h3>
<p>The phrase dúro vy ṛ̀ṇvan echoes ví … aurṇod dúraḥ, which opens the last
verse of the preceding hymn (I.68.10) and which itself forms a ring with vy ū̀rṇot of
I.68.1.
The tmánā ‘by himself/themselves’ must refer to the priests; since Agni is
regularly the subject of √vah, as the conveyor of oblations to the gods and of the
gods to the sacrifice, it is here emphasized that others are conveying him.
The last hemistich is identical with the last one of I.66.10, which itself forms a
ring with I.66.1. This set of hymns is very tightly knit together! As argued in the art.
cit., this verse marks the completion of the fire’s transformation into the Vaiśvānara
fire. Since that fire is identified with the sun, “all cry out on seeing the sun” is a
expression of the unified group’s first sight of and recognition of the fire that
symbolizes their unity – which has been presented to them by the priests who carry it
and throw open the doors for it to be seen in 10ab.</p>
<h2 id="i70-agni">I.70 Agni</h2>
<p>Again, for detailed discussion of the thematics of this hymn and its relation to
the two that precede it, see the publ. tr. and the art. cited above.</p>
<h3 id="i701">I.70.1</h3>
<p>It is perhaps appropriate that this last hymn in the Vaiśvānara series begins
with the martial verb vanema “may we vanquish,” since the function of the
Vaiśvānara fire is to unite the clans as a force to oppose its enemies.
The Pp. reads manīṣā́; most tr. read manīṣā́(ḥ) (see Old’s disc [Noten]).
However, I take it as both an instr. sg. -ā́and acc. pl. -ā́ḥ, with the poet, as so often,
taking advantage of potential ambiguity. This double reading is supported by I.73.9
(also Parāśara’s work), which contains the athem. opt. vanuyāmā corresponding to
them. vanéma here and three pairs of instr. + acc.: árvadbhiḥ … árvato nṛ́bhir nṛ́̄n,
vīraír vīrā́n vanuyāmā “Might we vanquish steeds with steeds, men with men, and
heroes with heroes.”</p>
<h3 id="i703">I.70.3</h3>
<p>sthātā́m and caráthām are pseudo-genitive plurals to this merism much
favored by Parāśara. There’s no orthodox way to generate them morphologically;
Re’s suggestion that sthātā́m is a compromise between *sthātrām and something that
looks more like a gen. pl. and that caráthām simply copied it seems a reasonable
proposal, however sketchy the details.</p>
<h3 id="i704">I.70.4</h3>
<p>A verse subject to numerous clashing interpretations. To deal with ádrau first
– Ge cites several passages in which Agni is born from or is the son of a/the stone. I
think it also likely that it is meant to contrast with duroṇé; the fire in the house is
actual and visible, while the fire in the rock is merely latent and not easily acquired.
Most tr. take the two hemistichs as independent units, which then necessitates
supplying something (what depends on the tr.) to make ab an actual clause. I prefer
to take the whole verse as a single clause, with svādhī́ḥ as the predicate, whose
complement is asmai (“… is very attentive to him [=Agni]”).
121
This leaves the enigmatic expression viśā́ṃ ná víśvo amṛ́taḥ. Most tr. want
this to refer to Agni; hence their interpretational separation of the two half-verses. I
think rather that it refers to those who serve Agni, both gods and humans. The two
groups are expressed in different ways and the connection between them is
actualized by a pun on víś- ‘clan’ and víśva- ‘all’; this pun in turn makes the secret
connection with Vaiśvānara, the clan fire (see Proferes p. 48). In the phrase, víśvaḥ
can be read both with amṛ́taḥ (“every immortal”) and with the gen. pl. viśā́m “every
(one) of the clans,” thus providing an indissoluble link between the mortal and divine
realms. And the ná makes clear that gods are exactly like men in their devotion to
Agni. I am reasonably convinced that this is the correct interpretation, but it does
trouble me that it is apparently identical to Max Müller’s (as reported by Old, SBE
n.), “To him also who dwells in the rock and in the house, every immortal like every
one among men is well disposed.”</p>
<h3 id="i705">I.70.5</h3>
<p>The interpretation of kṣapā́vant- as ‘earth-protector’, containing a zero-grade
form of the archaic noun kṣám- ‘earth’, goes back at least to the Petersburg
dictionary and is the overwhelming consensus in Western scholarship (see EWA, s.v.
kṣám-). However, a connection with the root noun kṣáp- ‘night’ has a more ancient
pedigree: the Pp. divides the word kṣapā́‘vān, and Sāy comments kṣapeti rātrināma /
rātrimān / āgneyī vai rātriḥ. At the very least we have a potential pun, and this pun is
actually realized in this hymn, since vs. 7b, two verses later, contains the relatively
rare root noun kṣáp-. Though vs. 5 has no mention of night and ‘earth-protector’
works fine in that context, the surfacing of kṣáp- ‘night’ so soon after might make the
audience reconsider and produce a secondary semantic association for kṣapā́vān.
With a suggestion of Scarlatta (1999: 303), we could then analyze kṣapā́vant- as
based on a syntagm with original predicative instrumental (kṣapā́“[he is] with
night”), which was then provided with a -vant- possessive suffix. Scarlatta (1999:
303) also suggests other ways to incorporate kṣáp-‘night’, e.g., by haplology from
*kṣápā + pā́- ‘protecting by night’ (his reconstructed initial accent reflects a posited
adverbial accent shift from inst. kṣapā́; see p. 303 and n. 452). The exact details
matter less than the fact that the Vedic audience could likely see a pun in this word,
between kṣa- as a combining form of kṣám- ‘earth’ and kṣap- ‘night’. The publ. tr.
“protector of riches on earth” reflects the standard Western interpr., though with an
adjustment to incorporate rayīṇā́m; I do believe that the pun on ‘night’ was available
to the audience, however. (See also X.29.1 and Jamison 2015 [Gerow Fs., IJHS 19].)
It should also be noted, however, that the analysis ‘earth-protector’ for kṣapā́vān is
reinforced in the next vs. (6ab) by an apparent paraphrase etā́… bhūmā ní pāhi
“protect these worlds.” The poet seems to be even-handedly offering alternative
views of kṣapā́vān.
Most tr. take ab as a nominal clause with suppressed dative (asmai or the like),
the antecdent of the yáḥ of the rel. cl. (“Agni is the protector … [for him] who…”). I
follow the interpr. of Velankar (1993: 41), who takes dā́śat as the verb of both main
and relative clauses, accented in the former because it is initial in its pāda (and in a hí
clause), in the latter because it’s in a subordinate clause. This grammatical and
122
semantic reciprocity would match that of the (asmai …) asmai, where the first,
suppressed dative refers to the worshiper and the second overt one to Agni. The
theme of reciprocity is prominent in this hymn group.</p>
<h3 id="i706">I.70.6</h3>
<p>mártān is almost surely an irregular gen. pl., rather than the acc. pl. it appears
to be. (Though “knowing the races of the gods and (knowing) the mortals” is possible,
the tight formulaic connection between gods and men/mortals throughout the RV
strongly favors the gen. pl.) Whether it is an archaism or is simply following the
morphologically sketchy lead of sthātā́m … caráthām in vs. 3 cannot be determined.</p>
<h3 id="i707">I.70.7</h3>
<p>The phrase pūrvī́ḥ kṣapó vírūpā(ḥ), lit. “many nights of differing form,” is
convincingly taken by most commentators as an elliptical pl. for “… nights (and
dawns)…,” since vírūpe regularly modifies the dual dvandva náktoṣā́sā ‘night and
dawn’, including in Parāśara’s I.73.7. (See Old’s lucid presentation in SBE n.) Most
tr. take it as the nom. pl. subject of várdhān, but, with Ge, I take it as an acc. pl.
expressing extent of time, supplying a pronominal subj. ‘they’, picking up “the races
of gods and men” in the previous vs. Either interpr. is possible, and there is little to
tip the balance one way or the other. Old argues that under the nominative interpr.,
which he favors, kṣapáḥ should probably be accented *kṣápaḥ (there are no other
nom. pl. forms), and the need to account for the wrong accent (if such it is) and the
fact that almost all occurrences of kṣapáḥ express extent of time (save for VIII.41.3,
where it’s a direct obj.) might favor the acc. interpr.
With essentially all Western commentators starting with Benfey, I read
carátham for the Pp. ca rátham, producing yet again Parāśara’s beloved, but
morphologically troubled, merism “the still and the moving.” With most tr. I take it
as neut. sg. and a second subject of várdhān (adjusted for number), though Ge
interprets it as a gen. dependent on the “Keim” he supplies.
The ppl. právīta- always means ‘impregnated’ (of females) or, as here,
‘conceived’ (see Scar p. 501); WG’s “den vom Ṛta gesuchten” seemingly rests on the
root etymology to √vī ‘pursue’, without taking into account the idiom.
I.70.8–9: See Proferes (pp. 47–49), esp. for the identification of the Vaiśvānara fire
in particular with the sun, and the publ. intro. and the art. cit, esp. for the encoding of
the Vaiśvānara fire by the successive grammatical subjects víśve (9cd) and náraḥ
(10ab).</p>
<h3 id="i709">I.70.9</h3>
<p>Note the vocabulary associated with human kingship: práśasti- ‘panegryic,
laud’ and balí- ‘tribute’. Since kings receive práśastis rather than bestowing them
and since the verb dhiṣe is medial (whatever else it is morphologically), the tr. of Old
SBE and Ge whereby Agni bestows the práśasti (e.g., Ge “du legst Wert auf die
Kühe, auf die Hölzer”) seem incorrect to me, esp. with the semantic bleaching of
práśasti to ‘worth, value’ (Old ‘excellence’). Although the phrase is distinctly odd, I
think the point of “you receive/acquire a laud among cows and firewood” is that both
the butter oblations represented by the cows and the firewood make noise when in
123
contact with fire, and this noise can be interpreted as an audible expression of praise.
For another instance of prá √śaṃs in Parāśara’s oeuvre, see I.73.2.
I.70.9–10: See Proferes (pp. 48–49) on these contrastive verses. Note the
complementary bháranta / bharanta beginning 9c and ending 10d respectively. Their
relationship and their semantic contrast is emphasized by the vi(…)s: bháranta
ví(śve)… ví … bharanta.</p>
<h3 id="i7010">I.70.10</h3>
<p>Neither of these hemistichs produces two proper Dvipadā Virāj pādas. The
first divides into 4 / 6 and presents as a Triṣṭubh lacking a syllable; the second has 11
syllables and is simply a Triṣṭubh, though with an irregular break.</p>
<h3 id="i7011">I.70.11</h3>
<p>What referent to supply with the adjectives sādhúḥ and gṛdhnúḥ isn’t
entirely clear. I follow Ge with ‘horse’, because sādhú- several times modifies horses
(see Ge’s cited parallels), though Re’s ‘warrior’ is equally plausible contextually.
As disc. in the art. cit., I do not believe, with Old (SBE, Noten) and others,
that this verse is a later addition. Rather it is a summary verse of the whole threehymn Vaiśvānara sequence, or even of all of Parāśara’s Dvipadā Virāj hymns to
Agni, and describes the Vaiśvānara as the ideal warrior and leader for the united
clans embarking on a joint enterprise.</p>
<h2 id="i71-agni">I.71 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="i711">I.71.1</h3>
<p>The meter of this first verse almost serves as a transition from Parāśara’s
Dvipadā Virāj hymns that precede it to his Triṣṭubh ones beginning here (–I.73), as
all four pādas (as well as 2a) have openings of 5 (as if in Dvipadā Virāj) and the first
two are syntactic units. The hymn then settles down into a pattern of mostly 4-
syllable openings.
The underlying fem. subject of this verse is universally taken to be the fingers
of the priest producing fire by friction from the kindling sticks. The qualifier sánīḷāḥ
can be read with both the simile and the frame: the fingers belong to the same hand
as the co-wives do to the same household. So Ge, etc. The sexual innuendo fits the
friction context well, in addition to setting the stage for the incest theme to come.
The object phrase śyā́viṃ áruṣīm “the dusky and the ruddy [fem.]” is
generally taken to refer to night and dawn (although Old [SBE and Noten] wishes to
emend the text to fem. nom. pls. modifying the sisters, a generally bad idea). The
identification with night and dawn is certainly supported by III.55.11, adduced by Ge,
etc., with the same vocabulary. However, it would essentially duplicate the simile of
d (“they delighted in night and dawn, like cows in dawn”), a clumsiness that seems
uncharacteristic of Parāśara, and one also wonders why the fingers would care about
night and dawn. I think, instead, that this is another of Parāśara’s tricks, using color
terms associated with the two time periods to pick out another referent entirely,
namely the aráṇi- (fem.) ‘kindling sticks’, which the fingers should care about, since
they are manipulating them. The color differentiation is a little odd, but I don&rsquo;t think
124
it&rsquo;s entirely out of the question. In X.184.3 the kindling sticks are called &lsquo;golden&rsquo;
(hiraṇyayī), and one can imagine that as the fire begins to catch hold, the upper stick
might glow red, while the lower one would be wreathed in dark smoke.</p>
<h3 id="i713">I.71.3</h3>
<p>A difficult verse with a discouragingly large number of competing
interpretations. In outline, though not in detail, I follow Ge’s interpretation: pāda a
concerns the production of poetry and the poetic vision by our side, in contrast to the
poetic visions of the stranger, our rival, in b. After the stranger’s attempts are gotten
rid of, the topic returns in cd to our poetic products, which have success. (WG
basically follow Ge, while Old [SBE] and Re take b as coreferential with cd.)
The first hemistich, esp. its first pāda, is highly alliterative and rhyming:
dádhann ṛtáṃ dhanáyann asya dhītím, ā́d íd aryó didhiṣvò víbhṛtāḥ. The two
parallel 3rd pl. verbs dádhan and dhanáyan technically do not match in mood, since
dádhan should be a subjunctive (the injunctive to this redupl. pres. should be either
*dadhat or dadhur, and the subjunctive of the latter verb should be dhanáyān; see
Hoffmann 1967: 271 n. 13, who produces a tr. with subjunctive contrasting with
preterite. However, in this context I think dádhan was created as a nonce injunctive
to match the two an sequences in dhanáyan. The subjects of these verbs are
simultaneously the Aṅgirases and the current poet-ritualists; the injunctive
conveniently elides the difference between past and present action.
The beginning of b, ā́d íd, generally has temporal value (“just after that”) and
is so tr. in the publ. tr. But Parāśara uses the expression in causal value in I.67.8 and
I.68.3, and a causal value is possible in the next verse (71.4); such an interpretation
works better here, and I would therefore change the tr. to “because of that …” The
launching of their own poetic vision by our side scatters the visions of our opponents.
The sentiment, but not most of the vocabulary, echoes that in I.70.1, where the arí- is
also the opponent.
The desid. adj. didhiṣú- to √dhā is based on the middle value of that root
(‘acquire’); so Heenen p. 165, though I do not subscribe to the additional semantic
baggage Heenen attaches to the stem. It means ‘desirous to acquire’, hence ‘greedy,
voracious’. With most tr. I assume a pl. of dhītí- as the referent.
Just as the injunctives of pāda a can have either presential or preterital value,
the lack of verb in b allows the temporal value to be set by the preceding clause,
hence applicable both to the current ritual situation and its mythological model. The
publ. tr. might be changed to “are/were dispersed.” There is no agreement on what
víbhṛtra- means here, but ví √bhṛ generally means ‘disperse, pull apart, carry away’,
and the form also needs to be considered in conjunction with víbhṛtaḥ in the next vs.
The “unthirsting” dhītí- belonging to us/the Aṅgirases are implicitly
contrasted with the voracious ones of the arí-, as Ge, etc., point out.
With Gr, Old, Re, I take apásaḥ as a nom. pl. fem.; Ge (/WG) rather as a gen.
sg. masc. referring to the singer/priest. This is certainly possible and would provide a
neat contrast to the gen. sg. aryáḥ of b. I would prefer, however, to keep the possible
reference to the Aṅgirases alive.
125
I would prefer not to take devā́n in d as a truncated gen. pl. construed with
jánma (or as a second acc. with vardháyantīḥ “strengthening the gods, their race”);
therefore, despite the pāda boundary, I take it with áchā, which frequently governs
devā́n (so, apparently, also Re); cf. esp. I.132.5 (=139.1) devām̐áchā ná dhītáyaḥ,
which is our underlying phrase.</p>
<h3 id="i714">I.71.4</h3>
<p>Another difficult verse, though it is clear that it alludes to the theft of fire by
Mātariśvan in the first hemistich. This theft is expressed through word play: the
verse begins máthīt, which can mean either ‘churn, rub’ (to produce fire) or ‘steal’.
In this Agni context, esp. given vs. 1, which concerns the churning of fire, ‘churn’
would be the most likely reading – and so it is tr. by Ge, Old (SBE), and Proferes
(2007: 31). But the name Mātariśvan ends the pāda, and this mythological allusion
would tip the balance towards ‘steal’ (so Re, WG).
The real problem comes in the middle of that pāda: the ppl. víbhṛtaḥ. This
form should mean ‘dispersed’ or ‘carried away’, and grammatically it should modify
mātaríśvā. However, sense would require it instead to qualify fire, the underlying
direct object in the clause; fire is often carried away and dispersed in various
locations. Cf. ví … bharanta in the preceding hymn I.70.10 and discussion there, as
well as the passages adduced by Old SBE, n. to vs. 4. There is no solution that
satisfies both sense and syntax. Ge suggests it&rsquo;s a transferred epithet, from Agni to
Mātariśvan; this seems a description of the problem, not a solution. Old suggests
simply displacing it rightward to read it with the assumed subj. of pāda b, namely
Agni (“When Mātariśvan had produced him by attrition, he …, who was brought to
many places, has come to every house”), and WG apparently follow. But this kind of
extraction from one clause and insertion in another is not syntactically possible in my
opinion, esp. given that in its clause it is placed between the acc. referring to Agni
(īm) and the nom. mātaríśvā, so that its grammatical affiliation is emphasized. Narten
reports a clever suggestion of Hoffmann’s, that the ví- is really ‘bird’, and the form
means ‘carried by a bird’ (“Das vedische Verbum math,” n. 38 [=KlSch p. 23 n. 38]),
but Mātariśvan should no more be carried by a bird than be dispersed. In the end the
least jarring rendering is Re’s “s’étant transporté çà et là,” presumably referring to
Mātariśvan’s journey. My “borne away” reflects a similar notion, and I also toyed
with the possibility that “carried away” may have the same extended meaning as the
English idiom, namely, “overcome with excitement.” No doubt Parāśara recognized
the trap he was setting, forcing the audience to find a way to interpret víbhṛtaḥ with
Mātariśvan rather than with the far more natural Agni.
As noted above, the subject of the next pāda must be Agni, established “in
every house” (cf. V.11.4, X.91.2). Because of the accent on bhū́t, the clause must be
parallel to pāda a and is not the main clause, which is introduced by ā́d īm in c.
On the second half of the verse see Proferes 2007: 30–31. Agni’s role as
messenger is of course well known: he travels between gods and men, heaven and
earth. This regular route may be prefigured here by Mātariśvan’s theft in a, for
elsewhere it is clear that M. stole fire from heaven (e.g., I.93.6). It is also said that M.
bestowed the stolen fire on Bhṛgu (see nearby I.60.1), and so the epithet bhṛ́gavāna-,
126
whatever its morphology, is apposite. What is unfamiliar is the simile, in which Agni
serves as messenger as if for a more powerful king. According to Proferes, Agni is
here “depicted … as the symbol of the presence of a leader’s authority within each
household.” I’m not sure, because Agni’s dūtá role involves traveling, not staying
put. I am inclined to think the simile was generated simply from dūtyàm and is not
meant to apply directly to Agni and his relationship to royal power.</p>
<h3 id="i715">I.71.5</h3>
<p>This vivid account of the incestuous attack of Father Heaven on his own
daughter (elsewhere Dawn) comes as a surprise in this hymn. The connection must
be the fact that this incest led to the birth of the Aṅgirases, who were the subject of
vs. 2 (and possibly vs. 3); this birth is mentioned in the other incest verse, vs. 8cd,
though without naming the Aṅgirases. The other connection is that Agni, unnamed,
is the avenger in this verse, shooting Heaven as he released his semen into his
daughter. Although the avenger is usually identified as Rudra on the basis of postṚvic passages (see Ge n. to vs. 5, Re, WG), I have demonstrated (Hyenas, 288–97)
that the original avenger was Agni. Note that ástā ‘archer’ is used of Agni in the last
verse of the immediately preceding hymn (I.71.11). I also take Agni as the subj. of
pāda b: like a hunter on his prey, he creeps up on the pair, having noticed the
caresses (pṛśanyàḥ) Heaven was bestowing on his daughter.
In addition I consider Agni to be the subject of pāda a (with most tr.), but the
action there is harder to explain: how and why does Agni make the sap=semen for
Heaven if he disapproves of Heaven’s sexual designs on his daughter and in fact
punishes him for the rape? For one thing, fire is unlikely to produce anything we
might consider sap; in a naturalistic sense, making rása for heaven would seem to be
storing up rain. However, our notions of nature and Vedic India’s are often at odds.
That the same semen (or possibly its delivery agent, the penis) is called tvíṣi- ‘spark,
flare’ in pāda d and, even more telling, is referred to as “blazing semen” (śúci rétaḥ)
in 8b, brings it into fire’s conceptual sphere. It may be that the flaring up of fire
produces Heaven’s semen. But what is Agni’s motivation? I’m afraid this remains
mysterious; perhaps it was involuntary, produced by the flaring up just suggested.</p>
<h3 id="i716">I.71.6</h3>
<p>This verse returns us to the ritual here-and-now and is considerably easier to
interpret than the scraps of mythology in the previous two verses. Still, there are a
few puzzles.
The verb ví bhāti ‘radiates widely’ is surprising, since its subject must be the
mortal worshiper, even though Agni (or occasionally Dawn) is ordinarily the subject
of this common verb. Old (SBE, repeated in Noten) suggests emending it to ví dhāti
‘worships’ (in Old’s tr.). (I sometimes get the feeling that in the Noten Old felt the
need to stick with emendations he’d suggested in his far more free-wheeling SBE tr.,
even though in his later years he was otherwise very reluctant to emend.) But a
metaphorical sense of ‘radiate’ works fine in the passage, as Ge points out, citing
parallels like VI.5.5, also of a mortal worshiper. And this would be an instance like
víbhṛtaḥ in 4 in which the most natural referent of a word is not the grammatically
supported one.
127
Old (SBE and Noten) also proposes to read dat. uśaté in b, or rather suggests
that the underlying form in sandhi was a dat. uśatá, since the spellings uśató ánu and
uśaté ánu “belong to the inventions of Vedic grammarians” (SBE n. 2 to vs. 6). This
is certainly possible, but a gen. form uśató would reflect what we might call the
“proleptic” use of the genitive for dative to express indirect object: the reverence was
offered to you and so it is now yours. This colonization of the dative by the genitive
is very common both in Vedic and in Classical Sanskrit, and already here it may
reflect the weakening of the dative case that led to its disappearance in MIA. I
certainly see no reason to take the transmitted uśató as acc. pl. with dyū́n, as Old
(Noten) and Ge (n. to 6b) tentatively suggest.</p>
<h3 id="i717">I.71.7</h3>
<p>The second hemistich consists of two contrasting halves: in c the speaker
complains that his (“our”) vitality (váyaḥ), the same vitality that Agni was said to
increase in 6c, is not to be seen throughout his kinsmen; this leaves Agni as the sole
figure who will find solicitude (prámati-) for him among the gods. Put thus, the
passage does not make much sense in English. It relies on the close relationship
between ‘solicitude’ and kinship (see esp. I.31.9-10, I.108.1, X.23.7, also adduced by
Ge) in the RV. The word prámati- denotes the kind of care and concern a father
shows for his children (or sons) and is regularly associated with, and indeed
identified with, the pitár- ‘father’ (see, e.g., I.31.9, 10, 14, 16) and secondarily with
the kin-group; cf. X.23.7 vidmā́hí te prámatiṃ deva jāmivát “for we know your
(fatherly) solicitude, o god, like that of kin.” Since in our passage the jāmí- has
proved disappointing, the poet turns to Agni for satisfaction. The question then is
what is the relationship between vitality and solicitude, which seem conceptually
distant. This is less clear, but the connection is also found in the prámati-heavy I.31
already cited; cf. I.31.10ab tvám agne prámatis tvám pitā́si nas, tváṃ vayaskṛ́t táva
jāmáyo vayám “You, Agni, are (fatherly) solicitude, you a father to us. You are
creator of vitality; we are your kin.” In the immediately preceding verse (I.31.9)
Agni is also called tanūkṛ́t- ‘body-creator’. The balanced pairing of tanūkṛ́t- and
vayaskṛ́t- in a paternal context suggests that in producing children the father creates
both the physical body and the intangible essence of life that together make up a
living being – ‘life-force’ might be a reasonable rendering of váyas – and the father’s
prámati- seems to be the catalyst that brings them together. Moreover, at least on the
evidence of our passage, váyas- seems to be something that can be shared by the kingroup, but in this case is not, and in such circumstances if one cannot rely on the
shared vitality of his relatives, he must look only to his father and his father’s
solicitude. For another association of vitality and the father in Parāśara’s work, see
I.73.1.
The publ. tr. does not convey this very well. In c I would replace “is not
widely perceptible” with “is not widely evident” or “does not appear throughout.” I
also question my supplying an object (vitality) with cikitvā́n; I now think this simply
characterizes Agni as the perceptive one or indicates that he perceives the situation
as a whole. The same word cikitvā́n does seem to take an object in 5b, however.

Against the Pp. I prefer to take vidā́as a lengthened 2nd sg. imperative rather
than subj. vidā́s, though there are no real implications either way.</p>
<h3 id="i718">I.71.8</h3>
<p>The incest myth treated in vs. 5 returns here with no more clarity. The various
alternative treatments are too numerous to discuss here, so I will present only my
own version, some of whose details I have adopted from others. The first hemistich
describes again Agni as the avenger, loosing his weapon at Heaven in the midst of
the latter’s sexual encounter with his daughter. In pāda a the téjaḥ, the sharp point of
the arrow, reaches the lord of men (=Agni, in my view), so that he can shoot it. I do
not understand why his preparation for shooting should be described thus, and in a
phrase ā́naṭ + ACC we might expect the acc. to express the target of the arrow.
Nonetheless, Heaven is not otherwise called nṛpáti-, and it would be odd to give him
this positive epithet in this situation. For Agni as an archer whose arrow has a téjassee VI.3.5 sá íd ásteva práti dhād asiṣyáñ, chíśīta téjò &lsquo;yasā ná dhā́rām “He, just like
an archer, has aimed (his arrow), about to shoot. He has whetted its point like a blade
of copper.” I take iṣé in this pāda as an infinitive to √iṣ ‘impel, send’ (others interpret
it as ‘to enjoy’); I then supply a form of this same verb in the next pāda, which
otherwise lacks one.
Note that the product of this incest, the young troop (śárdham … yúvānam), is
characterized as both ‘faultless’ (anavadyám) and ‘well-intentioned’ (svādhyàm),
asserting their goodness despite the circumstances of their birth.</p>
<h3 id="i719">I.71.9</h3>
<p>As mentioned in the publ. intro., the reason for including this verse,
containing the Sun and Mitra and Varuṇa but no mention of Agni, isn’t clear.
However, it may be that Mitra and Varuṇa, the guardians of the moral and ethical
order, and their all-seeing eye, the Sun, who observes all behavior, are brought in as
witnesses of the shocking incest of the last verse and the appropriate punishment
inflicted by Agni.</p>
<h3 id="i7110">I.71.10</h3>
<p>Another apparent non sequitur. I have nothing to say about the morphology
of the famous crux vidúḥ, which occurs also in VII.18.2 in the same phrase with the
same irregular sandhi (abhí vidúṣ kavíḥ sán). I do consider it a nom. sg., not acc. pl.
For further disc. see comm. at VII.18.2.</p>
<h2 id="i72-agni">I.72 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="i721">I.72.1</h3>
<p>The lexeme ní √kṛ, literally ‘make/do down’, idiomatically means to surpass
one’s opponent with regard to some quality by “putting” or “bringing” [them]
“down.” Indeed the English idiom “put down” is very close, but I chose not to use it
because it doesn’t convey quite the right sense with the right case frame. The verb
generally takes an acc. of the quality in question; the person who is outdone can be
either in the acc. (X.49.8), hence a double acc., or gen. (II.23.12), and there is some
disagreement among tr. about which construction we have here, since vedhásaḥ
śáśvataḥ can be either gen. sg. or acc. pl. Ge opts for the acc. pl. in the tr., but offers
129
the gen. sg. as alternative in his n.; Old, Re, WG choose the sg., as I have done,
though for no principled reason.
The náryā ‘manly powers’ in b contrasts both with kā́vyā in a and amṛ́tāni in
d. The first contrast would be between, roughly, warrior skills and verbal skills, the
second between human (though of course nṛ́- can often be used of gods, too) and
divine. For the latter pairing note that the two acc. pls. are construed with similar
verbs: middle participles to reduplicated formations, dádhānaḥ and cakrāṇáḥ.</p>
<h3 id="i722-1">I.72.2</h3>
<p>After the general proclamation of Agni’s universal powers in vs. 1, the hymn
turns to the myth of the disappearance and recovery of Agni.
The immortals’ inability to find Agni “among us” (asmé) is contrasted with
the success of the mortal who finds him “on the highest track,” presumably in the
realm of the immortals, in vs. 4.
The acc. phrase vatsám pári ṣántam is ambiguous, since the participle can
either modify vatsám (“the calf enclosing …”) or take vatsám as object (“enclosing
the calf”). Ge (WG) interpret it as the latter, Old, Re the former. Ge is surely correct:
pári ṣántam elsewhere (IV.1.15, VI.17.5, adduced by Ge) qualifies the rock that is
the Vala cave and takes “cows” as its object; cf. VI.17.5c … ádrim pári gā́ḥ …
sántam “… the rock enclosing the cows.” Although in the usual myth of the
disappearance of Agni, he is hidden not in a rock but in the waters, this transference
of Vala phraseology is enabled here because Agni is called a calf, and cattle were
enclosed in the Vala cave.
There is a slight phonological play in the phrase amṛ́tā ámūrāḥ. Also note
víśve amṛ́tāḥ “all the immortals,” a variant of víśve devā́ḥ. The use of this phrase is
telling because in Parāśara’s Vaiśvānara series (I.68–70) víśve is reserved to evoke
“all (men).” See discussion esp. in I.68 and in Jamison Klein Fs. 2016. I.68.8 also
contains a pāda-final ámūrāḥ, there referring to men.
Although the perfect of √sthā without preverb is almost always presential
(see Kü p. 580), in this mythological narrative it must be preterital (or at least so tr.
into English), like the injunctive vindan in pāda a; perhaps we can think of it as a sort
of “honorary” injunctive, whose temporal value is determined by context.
The form cā́ru (so Pp.; Saṃhitā cā́rv) is taken as a locative by Sāy (cāru
cāruṇi śobhane). This unlikely analysis is followed explicitly by Ge and Old (SBE,
more doubtfully Noten) and implicitly by Re and WG. (Gr. takes it as an adverb.) I
take it rather as the neut. acc. it appears to be and an alternative locational expression
to the adjacent loc. padé paramé, supplying nā́ma ‘name’ on the basis of nā́māni in
the next verse (3c) and the frequency of the collocation cā́ru nā́ma. It’s worth noting
that cā́ru nā́ma can be hidden or secret (e.g., II.35.11, IX.96.16), and so it would be
appropriate to this tale of the hidden Agni. What exactly it would mean to take their
stand at his name is not clear, perhaps at the place where Agni’s name is invoked in
ritual performance. This would fit with the following verse. It’s also possible that if
Agni’s dear name is what’s at issue, then the padé paramé might be the highest word,
as well as or instead of the highest track. (See 6ab below.)
130</p>
<h3 id="i723">I.72.3</h3>
<p>For my interpr. of the purport of this verse in a Tānunāptra context, see publ.
intro.
The identity of the subjects in this verse is disputed: Ge “die Erzväter,” Sāy
the Maruts, Re the gods. I consider this vs. a continuation (of sorts) of vs. 2 with
víśve amṛ́tāḥ still the subject. I have no explanation for the “three autumns.”
The interpretation of the verb form saparyā́n is quite problematic. It certainly
appears to be a subjunctive, and contrasts with the 3rd pl. injunctive saparyan that
Parāśara places in the same pāda-final position in I.70.10. But a subjunctive does not
sit comfortably in the dependent clause whose main clause contains a preterital
perfect (dadhire) and an augmented imperfect (ásūdayanta). Ge (also Re) compares
várdhān in I.70.7 (which I take differently) and calls it the subjunctive “bei
Zeitangabe” (n. to I.70.7ab), whatever that means. He tr. it as a preterite. Hoffmann
calls it a “Konjunktiv in präterital Sachverhalt” (p. 244). Re “ont honoré et
honoreront encore,” attributing what seems to me a unique interpretation to the
subjunctive. I consider the form a straight preterital and have an admittedly quite ad
hoc way to account for the apparent subjunctive. The present participle to this stem,
saparyánt-, is found 7x pāda-final as nom. sg. masc. saparyán; I suggest that in order
to make it clear that the form here is not that pres. participle, the final vowel was
lengthened, perhaps redactionally. This lengthening has no metrical consequences, of
course. The lengthening did not happen in saparyan in I.70.10 because it was
unaccented and couldn’t be mistaken for a participle. I am quite unhappy with this
explanation but even more unhappy with the idea of a subjunctive in this context.</p>
<h3 id="i724">I.72.4</h3>
<p>I consider ródasī a word play. It is of course a dual, referring to the two world
halves, but it also evokes rodasī́, the consort of the Maruts. Properly speaking she
should be in the acc. sg., hence a putative rodasī́m, but this form is not attested. In</p>
<h3 id="i1674">I.167.4</h3>
<p>we find rodasī́in acc. usage: the singular consort has simply been
grammatically assimilated to the dual world halves in all her appearances.
The intensive part. vévidānāḥ could technically belong either to √vid ‘know’
or √vid ‘find’, whose middle generally means ‘acquire’, and it is somewhat difficult
to know which root is supposed to be represented in Ge’s “Gehör finden bei” and
Re’s “trouvant-accueil près de.” With Old and Schaeffer (p. 183–85) I take it with
‘find, acquire’, though I am somewhat puzzled by what the intensive part is supposed
to contribute – perhaps the sense of constantly keeping their acquisition close by; this
would work better for the consort than the two worlds. Schaeffer’s tr. (p. 185)
“nachdem sie die beiden hohen Rodasī gefunden haben” has no intensive nuance, and
she indeed suggests that the form does not really belong to the intensive, but is a
substitute for the perfect participle (*vividānā́ḥ) on metrical grounds, hence her
preterital tr. I find this substitution hypothesis unlikely, given that the intensive is
quite a marked formation and the accent patterns of the two formations are different.
The Pp. reads rudríyā (neut. pl.), not -āḥ with most tr. As Ge and Old (Noten)
point out, the Pp. reading is not impossible, but the masc. pl. works better. If the first
pāda makes reference to Rodasī, a nom. pl. referring to the Maruts makes better
sense.
131
Tr. differ on the interpretation of nemádhitā; I render it as close to my interpr.
of its other three occurrences, ‘when facing the other side’, used of battle arrays
(VI.33.4, VII.27.1, X.93.13). That it refers to men and gods being divided (so Ge,
WG) seems farfetched and ignores the evidence of the other identical occurrences
and inserts a referent (men and gods) that is simply not there.
The last pāda echoes 2d, except it is Agni standing on the highest track, not
his pursuers.</p>
<h3 id="i725">I.72.5</h3>
<p>On this verse as an expression of the Tānunāptra ritual see Proferes 2007: 59.
The verse begins with a form of the resonant idiom sám √jñā ‘come to an
agreement, act in harmony” that was so important in Parāśara’s Vaiśvānara cycle
(see I.68.8, 69.9 and disc. there and in Jamison Fs. Klein 2016). Here it expresses the
unity not of all men, as in the Vaiśvānara cycle, but of the gods, even including their
wives. Or so I interpret it; Ge and Re thinks the group includes both gods and men.
This seems unlikely to me, in part because pátnīvant- only qualifies gods (except for
pressed soma drinks in VIII.93.22). As I have discussed elsewhere, I do not think that
the Sacrificer’s Wife later called pátnī was yet established in the ṚV; she was only
being introduced (and this introduction contentious) in the latest strata of the text.
Most tr. take ririkvā́ṃsas tanvàḥ kṛṇvata svā́ḥ to mean “having abandoned
their former bodies, they took on their own (new bodies),” but this is somewhat
incoherent: were their old bodies any less “their own” than the putative new ones?
Proferes’s tr. (p. 59) seems self-contradictory, “Having yielded their bodies, they
made [their bodies] their own,” but his explanation makes sense of this: they
“overcome their atomization by relinquishing their ‘bodies’ in the course of a fire
rite; they thus make their own (svā́ḥ) the collectivity of their own individual bodies,
which is to say that each individual within the group identifies with the ‘bodies’ of all
the others.” By taking kṛṇvata as reciprocal, as I do, rather than just reflexive, this
sense can be found in the passage directly.</p>
<h3 id="i726">I.72.6</h3>
<p>The Pp. reads unaccented avidan, but accented ávidan should be extracted
from the ambiguous sequence padā́vidan.
As often with RVic numerology, the identity of the three times seven secret
padā́is not clear. Ge tr. padā́as Wörte (sim. Re), which is certainly possible and has
parallels (see Ge’s disc. in n. to 6ab), but the padé paramé that figured significantly
earlier in the hymn (2d, 4d) should be kept in mind. Moreover, in the next vs. Agni is
said to be “inwardly knowing the roads (ádhvanaḥ) leading to the gods” (7c), and
since the padā́were found in Agni here, it may be that these padā́are tracks and
identical to the ádhvanaḥ that he inwardly knows. As I argued in the publ. intro., I
think the padā́are the “tracks” of the ritual.
What amṛ́tam refers to is also unclear; it could be, as Sāy suggests, Agni, or
simply “immortality, the immortal principle” (so Re). It unfortunately cannot be the
body, which is fem. Note the “way towards immortality” (amṛtatvā́ya gātúm) in 9b
below.
132
The phrase sthātṝ́n caráthaṃ ca with its number mismatch shows Parāśara’s
fondness for this merism (I.66.9, 68.1, 70.3, 7) and the grammatical anomaly found
in most of the occurrences in his oeuvre; see disc. ad locc.</p>
<h3 id="i727">I.72.7</h3>
<p>The referent of “for them” in the tr. of b is the “settled peoples” of a.
On the possible relationship between the ádhvanaḥ here and the padā́of 6b,
see disc. there.</p>
<h3 id="i728">I.72.8</h3>
<p>The first pāda lacks an overt verb, but it is easy to read ví … ajānan from b
(with most tr.), rather than supplying an entirely different verb as Ge does
(“brachten”). The identity of the subject is likewise not given, but, with Ge, it is quite
likely the Aṅgirases. The qualifier svādhī́- ‘very attentive’ is a signature word of
Parāśara’s (I.67.2, 70.4, 71.8); the occurrence in 71.8 is applied to the troop,
presumably the Aṅgirases, that Agni begets in punishing Heaven’s incest.
The “seven youthful ones of heaven” are the heavenly rivers; note the
corresponding phrase in the previous hymn, I.71.7 (though in a simile) sravátaḥ
saptá yahvī́ḥ “the seven youthful streams,” and for divó yahvī́- III.1.6, 9, VII.70.3.
The position of ā́between diváḥ and saptá yahvī́ḥ does give one pause, however,
since postposed ā́with abl. can mean ‘from’. Perhaps this is a mixed construction:
“from heaven they discerned the … maidens of heaven.” I do not know what the
seven maidens of heaven are doing here.
The VP “discerned the doors of wealth” (rāyó dúro ví … ajānan) is a variant
of “opened the doors (of wealth)” found twice earlier in the Parāśara collection:</p>
<h3 id="i6910-1">I.69.10</h3>
<p>ví rāyá aurṇod dúraḥ … and I.70.10 duró vy ṛ̀ṇvan.</p>
<h3 id="i729">I.72.9</h3>
<p>This verse is the most baffling in the hymn, both for its contents and for its
connection to the rest of the hymn. Ge has a very busy interpretation (followed by
WG) that involves the Aṅgirases and the Ādityas separating themselves from the
earth and contending to reach heaven. His interpr. rests on scraps of later mythology,
and it is very difficult for me to see where he finds contending parties in the passage,
much less the signs that would identify them as Aṅgirases and Ādityas. It also
requires an unlikely reading of ví √sthā as ‘separate’, rather than the usual ‘spread
out’ (as Re points out). All in all, the interpretation requires a superstructure that the
verse cannot support, and examining the passage without the presuppositions Ge
brings to it yields a very different picture. Unfortunately, however, the picture isn’t
appreciably clearer.
I think that the verse continues the theme of the original discovery of the
hidden “tracks” of ritual performance: having discovered them (see 6ab), the subjects
of 9ab, the gods most likely, perform the required ritual actions, which lead both to
offspring and to “immortality.” The second hemistich is considerably more difficult,
but I tentatively suggest that it also depicts a primal sacrifice. The “stretching” of the
ritual ground in an ordinary sacrifice, that is, the laying out of its boundaries and the
positioning of the offering fire, is here expressed in cosmic terms: the earth herself
spreads out to provide the ritual ground; she does this through the actions of her sons,
133
the ritual participants. And she then “suckles the bird.” Most take the bird as Agni,
whatever else they do with the verse, and the suckling, that is, the tending of the
ritual fire with wood and oblations, would work fine in this scenario. Re thinks rather
the sun, and again the sun as cosmic representative of the ritual fire is thinkable.
I will now treat some of the elements of the verse in more detail. Although
svapatyá- can be substantivized to mean “good descendants,” it is originally and
more commonly an adjective, and even when a head noun is absent, it can be
supplied. In this case I interpret the word in the same way as VII.91.3c víśvén náraḥ
svapatyā́ni cakruḥ “The men have done all (ritual actions) bringing good
descendants.” Here the governing verb is “mount” (ā́… tasthuḥ), which I take as
metaphorical for ‘embark on’. With the journey theme of pāda b, the (actions of) the
sacrifice can be conceived of as a chariot, as so often in the RV.
The yé of ab is picked up by the “great sons” of cd (mahádbhiḥ … putraíḥ).
These can be the offspring produced by the ritual in pāda a or, more likely in my
opinion, the performers of those actions – the gods or, perhaps more narrowly, the
Ādityas – who are responsible for the cosmic sacrifice in which their mother, the
earth herself, spreads out as the ritual ground. I would slightly alter the publ. tr. to
“by means of her sons … the earth …” Keep in mind that the gods are the sons of
Heaven and Earth (cf. the bahuvrīhi in the dual devá-putre ‘having the gods as sons’),
so Earth is their mother. I am inclined against restricting the subject to the Ādityas. I
think rather that mother Earth is called Aditi because Aditi is an archetypal mother,
but her sons are all the gods, not just the Ādityas. The next verse (10b) simply refers
to the immortals, in what seems to be a continuation of this narrative, and the default
subject throughout seems to be the gods in general.
Note that “to suckle the bird” (dhā́yase véḥ) is a paradox that would be
recognized by any reasonably alert observer of nature (as the Vedic people certainly
were), in that birds aren’t mammals and don’t suckle. The sense of dhā́yase can of
course be bleached to something like Old’s (SBE) “for the refreshment of the bird,”
but I prefer to think this paradox was meant to be savored, along with the paradox of
the sons bringing about the action of their mother.</p>
<h3 id="i7210">I.72.10</h3>
<p>The first half of the verse may return to the Tānunāptra theme. Although I
would prefer a middle verb rather than active ní dadhuḥ, the first pāda could depict
the joint deposit of their shared śrī́in the ritual fire (cf. the echo of níhitā in 6b),
while the second pāda continues the cosmogonic theme of the previous verse. I
confess, however, that the very parallel I.73.4c ádhi dyumnáṃ ní dadhur bhū́ry asmin
gives me pause. Either I need to interpret that as also a Tānunāptra passage or delete
the reflexive implication here. Because of the active verb, I am inclined to change my
Tānunāptra interpretation and tr. simply “they deposited dear splendor in him,”
although since cā́ru- can have a quasi-reflexive sense ‘own dear’, it may be possible
to interpret the two passages differently.
As for the second hemistich, the rivers of pāda c are most likely the oblations
poured into the fire. The referent of the fem. pl. nī́cīḥ … áruṣīḥ is less clear, and in
fact most tr. (Ge, Old SBE, Re, WG) take the two feminines separately, with one
134
nom., the other the acc. object of prá … ajānan. I think rather that the two words
belong together as subj. and refer again to the oblations. The lexeme prá √jñā does
not otherwise take an object, but just means ‘know the way, think ahead’. As
underlying referent of the feminine adjectives I would supply dhā́rā ‘stream’ vel
sim.; ‘downward facing’ certainly applies to the oblations, though ‘ruddy’ is more
difficult. However, fem. áruṣī- can be used of cows; since the ghee poured into the
fire is a product of cows, it can be so described, even though ghee is of course not
ruddy itself.</p>

<p>For the complex relationship between ‘vitality’ (váyaḥ) and the father, see
disc. ad I.71.7. The “wealth acquired from one’s father” also reminds us of I.70.10,
where the sons divide and carry away the property of their aged father.
Agni’s traversing of the (sacrificial) seat (sádma … ví tārīt) in my opinion
refers to the removal of what is later called the Āhavanīya fire from the Gārhapatya
fire at the west end of the ritual ground and its ceremonial placement at the east end.
See 2d.</p>
<h3 id="i732">I.73.2</h3>
<p>Pāda a is more literally “who, like Savitar, possesses realized thoughts,” but I
have adjusted the English to avoid awkwardness.
In c most tr. take satyáḥ as the shared term in the simile amátir ná (Ge “wahr
wie ein Bildnis”) or as modifying amátiḥ in the simile (WG “wie eine verwirklichte
Erscheinung”). The latter is impossible because amáti- is feminine. The former does
not convey much sense. The purport of the simile of course depends on the meaning
of amáti-, which I consider to be more concrete and specific than the usual glosses
‘appearance, form, picture’. An amáti- can be golden (III.38.8), broad and wide
(V.62.5, VII.38.2, 45.2); it is associated with lordship (V.69.1 amátiṃ kṣatríyasya),
can be displayed on a chariot box (I.64.9), and is unloosed or unfurled (V.45.2,
VII.45.3). All of this suggests that it is a pennant or ensign or other flag-like object.
On the basis of its association with lordship, I suggest that it can be a royal emblem
and that that is the basis for the simile here. As discussed ad I.70.9 and in Jamison
forthcoming, prá √śaṃs ‘proclaim, laud’ is a lexeme particularly appropriate to
kings, and here Agni is lauded by many like the royal emblem, which is the symbol
of the king. This interpretation leaves pāda-final satyáḥ somewhat stranded, and I
read it with the following pāda. Perhaps it was stationed in the c pāda because of
satyá(manmā) in almost the same position in the a pāda. Alternatively it can simply
be another qualifier of Agni in b, independent of the simile: “lauded by many like a
(royal) emblem, real …”
Most tr. give a rather vague and general rendering of the morphologically
elaborate desiderative gerundive didhiṣā́yyaḥ, “desirable to hold/win’. I think it has a
more technical ritual sense, referring to the installation of the fire (so also in the
other occurrence of this form in II.4.1). This would reflect the same sense of √dhā as
the adjective puróhita-, of the fire ‘placed/installed in front/to the east’ and the later
135
ritual complex the Agnyādheya ‘establishment of the fire(s)’. If my interpr. of 1d is
correct, namely that the offering fire has been taken from west to east, then the next
step would be its installation in the east.</p>
<h3 id="i733">I.73.3</h3>
<p>For the first three pādas, cf. III.55.21.
The construction of this verse is more complex than the two preceding ones
and, in my opinion, displays some tricky relationships with Parāśara’s phraseology
elsewhere. To begin with, the first simile as it stands is pleonastic at best: Agni
should not be “like a god,” since he is a god. Nor should he be “like a god who
dwells on earth,” since in fact Agni is the only god, or (counting Soma) the primary
god, who dwells on earth. I suggest tentatively that the opening devó ná is there to
match ná rā́jā at the end of the hemistich. Even more tentatively I suggest that what
is really being compared is pṛthivī́ṃ viśvádhāyā(ḥ). Note first that in the preceding
hymn (10cd) mother earth spread out “to suckle the bird [probably =Agni]” (dhā́yase
véḥ) and elsewhere earth is called “all-nourishing” (II.17.5 pṛthivī́ṃ viśvádhāyasam).
I think here that Parāśara is covertly comparing Agni to the earth with regard to this
well-known trait of hers, but does so playfully and allusively by stationing acc.
pṛthivī́m next to nom. viśvádhāyā(ḥ) (in the same metrical position as II.17.5 though
in Triṣṭubh not Jagatī cadence) and by the intertextual associations evoked by his
stating that earth suckled Agni in I.72.9. So the, or an, underlying meaning of pāda a
is “the god who, all-nourishing like the earth, …,” though both the position of the
simile marker and the case of ‘earth’ disallow this as a surface meaning. (Let me
make clear that I am not suggesting emending the text to *pṛthivī́.)
The two compounds hitá(mitra-) (b) and puraḥ(sádaḥ) may make implicit
reference to the word I suggested is to be associated with didhiṣā́yyaḥ in 2d, namely
puró-hita, as a descriptor of the installed ritual fire. The second, puraḥsád-, is
essentially a synonym of puróhita-.
Although I try to avoid explanations like “attraction,” I am afraid I must
follow Ge in taking the common term of the similes in c and d as “attracted” to the
comparandum: puráḥsadaḥ to the pl. vīrā́ḥ from putative sg. *puráḥsad, anavadyā́to
the fem. nā́rī from putative masc. *anavadyáḥ. Although it would be possible to
avoid the attraction analysis by reading both terms as part of the simile proper (“like
heroes stationed in front and stationed for protection, like an irreproachable wife
pleasing to her husband,” so WG), this puts the simile marker one element too far to
the right and it also submerges the common term. This would be particularly
unfortunate in the first simile, since there is a play on two slightly different senses of
-sád- there. (In I.65.5 a similar gender mismatch is found, explained by Re as
attraction, an explanation I rejected. But there it does not involve a misplaced simile
marker.)</p>
<h3 id="i734">I.73.4</h3>
<p>As noted at I.72.10 our c is almost identical to pāda a there. The publ. tr.
treats the first as a Tānunāptra passage (“deposited their own śrī́”) but not this one,
and the two should probably be brought into harmony. I now favor taking neither one
as a Tānunāptra expression, but see disc. ad I.72.10. In this case the deposit of
136
‘heavenly brilliance’ (dyumná-) may be what allows Agni to become the foundation
of riches.</p>
<h3 id="i735">I.73.5</h3>
<p>The verb ví … aśyuḥ should be read with both pādas, but, in my opinion, with
slightly different senses. In pāda a pṛ́kṣaḥ is a straight acc. object to the lexeme in the
meaning ‘reach, attain’; in pāda b víśvam ā́yuḥ may be one too (“attain a whole
lifetime”) as most take it, but it may also be an acc. of extent of time (“reach through
a whole lifetime”). The meaning is almost the same, but it would be like Parāśara to
put the constructions slightly off-balance, and the compound viśvā́yuḥ is something
of a signature word for Parāśara (see the immediately preceding vs. 4d, plus I.67.6,
10, 68.5) as an adverb expressing extent of time (“lifelong,” etc.). Note the phonetic
echoes, pāda a: ví … aśyur, b: ví … ā́yuḥ; the first of these distracted sequences also
evokes viśvā́yuḥ.
Pāda c sanéma … aryó is reminiscent of I.70.1a vanéma … aryó …
The phrase bhāgáṃ devéṣu … dádhānāḥ is almost a paraphrase of I.68.4a
bhájanta … devatvám. I would therefore change the publ. tr. “a portion among the
gods” to “a share in the gods.”</p>
<h3 id="i736">I.73.6</h3>
<p>The referents of the “cows of truth” (ab) and the rivers (cd) are unclear, nor is
it clear whether they refer to the same thing. But I think they must be evaluated in the
context of this hymn, in which men (vs. 4), patrons (vs. 5), and gods (vs. 7) all serve
Agni in one way or another and seek rewards from him; the cows and the rivers then
must be another set of devotees and aspirants to his favor, esp. since the same phrase
sumatím bhíkṣamāṇā(ḥ) “seeking a portion of favor” is used of the rivers (6c) and the
worship-worthy (gods) (7a). I would tentatively suggest a twofold interpretation: 1)
A naturalistic one: the swelling cows are the rains, “apportioned by heaven,” with
their bellowing the thunder and the udders the clouds. The rains both are the
(heavenly) rivers and feed the (earthly) rivers. Recall the seven heavenly rivers of</p>
<h3 id="i717-1">I.71.7</h3>
<p>and 72.8. Thus, the natural world pays heed to Agni, along with men and gods.
2) A ritual one: as Ge points out, these can be the milk and the water needed for the
soma sacrifice, though I confess I would prefer ritual substances more associated
with Agni. See I.72.10 where I suggested that the rivers were streams of ghee. I do
not believe that we need to see a reference to the Vala and Vṛtra myths here, as Ge
suggests.
I do not think that the rivers flow through the rock, pace Ge, etc., but rather
over. There are three passages in IX with samáyā and ví+VERB OF MOTION, all
dealing with soma going across the fleece (IX.75.4, 85.5, 97.56; cf. IX.85.5 vy
àvyáyaṃ samáyā vā́ram arṣasi “You rush across the sheep&rsquo;s fleece all at once.”). So I
think the rivers are flowing across or over the rock, but it would help tremendously if
I had any idea what the rock represents.</p>
<h3 id="i737">I.73.7</h3>
<p>The voc. agne was inadvertently omitted from the publ. tr., so “o Agni”
should be inserted after “in you.”
137
The second pāda could also mean “they acquired fame in heaven.” The phrase
should be read with 5d bhāgáṃ devéṣu śrávase dádhānāḥ and 10c ádhi śrávo
devábhaktaṃ dádhānāḥ. The latter passage, especially, suggests that ‘acquire’ is the
better rendering.
The accented cakrúḥ in c can be explained, following Klein (DGRV I.176–77),
as triggered by the “rhetorically complementary nature of pādas c and d.” There is no
need to take the ca in c as a subordinator, particularly because subordinating ca
introduces conditional clauses. Note the contrast between ví(rūpe) and sáṃ (dhuḥ), a
common rhetorical pairing.</p>
<h3 id="i739">I.73.9</h3>
<p>Note the echo of I.70.1, with optatives to the same (synchronic) root and a
likely identical case frame. See disc. ad I.70.1.
The second hemistich reprises material from earlier in the hymn: “wealth
acquired from their fathers” is exactly the same phrase, though in a different case, as
the simile that begins the hymn (I.73.1a); the patrons with their long lives were
encountered in 5b.</p>
<h3 id="i7310">I.73.10</h3>
<p>Ge’s interpr. of pāda c is persuasive. II.5.1 śakéma vājíno yámam (also
III.27.3, VIII.24.22) contains the missing horses supplied here. I take sudhúraḥ as
proleptic.
For pāda d cf. 5d and 7b; for devábhakta- cf. dyúbhakta- in 6b.</p>
<h2 id="i74-agni">I.74 Agni</h2>
<p>Several verses in this hymn are linked in relative cl. / main cl. structures: 1/2,
4/5. Vs. 6 may also be connected to 4/5. See disc. below.</p>
<h3 id="i742">I.74.2</h3>
<p>This interpr. of snī́hitīṣu rests on a metaphorical use of the original sense of
√snih ‘snow’. On this root as warrior slang, see Hoffmann MSS 18 (1965) = Aufs.
447ff.</p>
<h3 id="i744">I.74.4</h3>
<p>The second pāda contains two forms of √vī ‘pursue’, which by most tr. get
reduced to one, with the finite veḥ seemingly playing merely a modal or auxiliary
role: Ge “du … die Opferspenden entgegenzunehmen wünschest”; Re “tu vas pour
agréer ses oblations”; Old (SBE) “to whose sacrificial food thou eagerly comest for
feasting.” The doubling is, however, captured by WG: “der du (die Götter) aufspürst,
damit sie die Opfergaben aufspüren,” resting on observations of Scar (498–99). I am
in independent agreement with WG on this construction. The root √vī regularly takes
both gods and oblation(s) as object; here the oblations are overt, but the gods are the
missing first object – the initial goal of Agni’s pursuit, to cause them in turn to
pursue the mortal worshiper’s oblations as underlying subject of the infinitive vītáye.
Cf. I.77.2 (also a Gotama hymn) agnír yád vér mártāya devā́n “When Agni, for the
sake of the mortal, pursues the gods,” where the gods are surface object of véḥ and
the benefit for the mortal worshiper is emphasized. In our own hymn vs. 6 has a full
surface realization of the structure presumed here, with the gods as subj. of the
138
infinitive and the oblations its object, though with a different main verb: ā́ca váhāsi
tā́m̐ihá, devā́n … / havyā́… vītáye “You will convey the gods here to pursue the
oblations.”</p>
<h3 id="i745">I.74.5</h3>
<p>I recast the acc. to nom. in English, in order to be able to preserve verse
structure.</p>
<h3 id="i746">I.74.6</h3>
<p>There is no obvious reason for the accent on the verb váhāsi. Ge (/WG), Re,
Klein (I.243-44) take it as triggered by a subordinating ca, as does, somewhat
tentatively, Old (ZDMG 60: 733 = Kl Sch 208). But this verse does not work very
well as a conditional clause for vs. 7, and in fact Re recognizes this semantic
disconnect by ending his tr. of vs. 6 with suspension dots. If vs. 6 is subordinated to
anything, it would be better to connect it with vs. 5, repeating the message of vs. 4,
which is likewise subordinated to 5. I would simply call attention to several passages
with this same conjunction of elements with an accented verb and no clear
motivation for the accent: III.43.4 ā́ca &hellip; váhātaḥ, X.110.1 ā́ca váha &hellip; We may be
dealing with a catchphrase or with spread of the accent redactionally from a passage
in which it was correct to superficially similar phrases.
On the vītáye construction, see disc. ad vs. 4.</p>
<h2 id="i75-agni">I.75 Agni</h2>
<p>I.75.1–2: Note the play between the two final words of these verses: āsáni / sānasí.
The two verses also contain four superlatives in -tama-, each to a stem ending in -as.
I.75.3–4: As noted in the publ. intro., only the first of the questions in vs. 3 is
answered in vs. 4, though the latter appears to be structured as the replies.</p>
<h3 id="i755">I.75.5</h3>
<p>The three pādas contain three 2nd sg. verb forms belonging to √yaj, two pres.
imperatives yájā (a, b) and a so-called “si-imperative” yákṣi (c). Though “siimperatives” do often function as imperatives, they are haplologized -s-aorist
subjunctives by most accounts. I so tr. yákṣi here, since the poet could easily have
repeated yájā in this context; it would have been metrically fine and in fact would
have produced a more iambic pattern. It is accented because it follows an
extrasentential voc. For another si-imperative that is better rendered as a subjunctive
see ní … satsi in I.76.4 in the next hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i7677">I.76–77</h3>
<p>These two Triṣṭubh hymns are out of sequence, in that they both contain
five verses. The preceding hymn I.75 in Gāyatrī also contains five verses, and among
hymns of the same number of verses to the same divinity, those in the longer meter
(in this case Triṣṭubh) should precede. Curiously, Old does not remark on this. The
proper sequencing is restored with I.78, five verses in Gāyatrī.</p>
<h2 id="i76-agni">I.76 Agni</h2>
<p>139</p>
<h3 id="i761">I.76.1</h3>
<p>As often, vā ‘or’ doesn’t present two balanced choices, but could be
paraphrased as “or, to put it another way…” That is, it rephrases and varies (often
substantially) a previous statement or question.
The first and last pādas contain forms of mánas-, which I have tr. differently.
The first, in the phrase mánaso várāya, is idiomatic in English as “heart’s desire,” not
“mind’s desire/choice/wish.” The expression in the last pāda, kéna … mánasā, might
better be rendered “in what spirit,” though I’ve chosen to stick closer to the ‘mind’
sense.
The pf. of √āp can be used presentially (so also Kü, though not with ref. to
this passage), and that value works best here: the focus in all four clauses is what we
can do to best serve Agni, not what someone has done in the past.</p>
<h3 id="i763">I.76.3</h3>
<p>The accent on dhákṣi is unmotivated. WG label it as antithetical accent, but
that is only found in sequences that are more tightly bound rhetorically than this one.
(If all imperatives in sequence received “antithetical accent,” there would be many
more of them, beginning with ní ṣīda and bhavā in 2ab.)
Ge and Re both assert that the referent of asmai in d, the recipient of the guest
reception (ātithyám), is Agni. This seems perverse to me, though grammatically
possible. Agni is urged to bring Indra (“the lord of soma”) to the ritual ground; the
guest reception is surely for this new arrival and will consist of the usual ritual
offerings given to Indra, including soma. It is of course true that Agni is regularly
called ‘guest’ (átithi-), but that doesn’t seem relevant here.
The two hemistichs end with two unusual -van- forms: (abhiśasti-)pā́van- and
(su-)dāvan-. Though parallel in formation, they are in different cases (nom. and dat.
respectively), which somewhat conceals their morphological match. They are near
hapaxes: the first is found only once elsewhere in the RV (VII.11.3) in a similarly
constructed pāda, the latter only here.</p>
<h3 id="i764">I.76.4</h3>
<p>Although the contents of this verse are pretty straightforward, the syntax is
particularly nasty.
The major problem comes in the first hemistich, with huvé, whose identity
and function are not clear. Or rather what it appears to be is not easily compatible
with the context. The form huvé and its unaccented counterpart are extremely
common and always 1st sg. mid. to √hū / hvā ‘call’, with the sense “I call / invoke X.”
If we take it in this sense and construe it with the nominative of pāda a, váhniḥ
‘conveyor’, there is semantic mismatch. The most likely referent of the expression
váhnir āsā́“the conveyor by mouth” is Agni, who carries the oblations to the gods in
or with his mouth; see havyā́júhvāna āsáni in the previous hymn (I.75.1) and the
next and final verse of this hymn where he performs sacrifice juhvā̀“with his tongue.”
He should properly be the object of huvé. Old and Ge (/WG) interpret the váhnir āsā́
instead as the human poet, who brings the god(s) to the ritual by mouth, that is, by
his hymns. This is a clever idea and does allow the 1st ps. interpretation. The problem
then is the accent of huvé, though it could be classified with the problematic accent in
140
ā́ca váhāsi in Gotama’s first hymn (I.74.6), which shares the opening ā́ca. Re does
not want to give up the identification of the váhnir āsā́with Agni (nor do I), and
attributes the syntax to anacoluthon: the first pāda is a nominative expression
describing Agni, which breaks off and gives way to an abrupt imperative “je
(l’)appelle.” The verbal accent remains a problem. I have another equally ad hoc
solution: that huvé is an infinitive (built like bhuvé to √bhū) and used predicatively,
as huvádhyai can be. This would solve the problem of accent, but the drawback is
inventing an otherwise unattested form that is homonymous with the extremely wellattested 1st sg. mid.
Note the sequence (vá)casā &hellip;āsā́(ā́) ca &hellip; ca sa(tsī).
The other syntactic issue in the verse is the predicated vocative phrase in d:
bodhí prayantar janitar vásūnām. My tr. fails to render the predication; others (e.g.,
Ge) fail to render the voc. There is no good way to do this in English (or German).
Note that vásūnām is accented, although oblique cases that are part of voc. phrases
often are not (type sūno sahasaḥ “o son of strength”).</p>
<h2 id="i77-agni">I.77 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="i771">I.77.1</h3>
<p>All tr. take the kṛṇóti in d as if it were ā́kṛṇóti as in 2b, with the meaning
“attract the gods hither.” But the ā́√kṛ idiom in vs. 2 is medial, and there is no ā́here.
I prefer to take kṛṇóti as a dummy verb, standing for yájati, extracted from yájiṣṭhaḥ
‘best sacrificer’. Hence “does so,” that is “sacrifices.” This also helps account for the
íd.</p>
<h3 id="i772">I.77.2</h3>
<p>On the basis of VI.49.6 I most likely want to rethink my interpr. of tám … ā́
kṛṇudhvam from “attract him here” to “make him your own.” See comm. ad loc.
Among other things, since “him” is Agni and Agni as ritual fire is already here, we
need not attract him here.
The injunc. véḥ (vér in sandhi) is by most analyses a 3rd sg. to the root pres.
to √vī ‘pursue’, despite the -s ending. The same form with the same 3rd ps. value is
found in II.5.3 and IV.7.7; see comm. ad locc. I would now be inclined to alter the tr.
to “when Agni … pursues,” to avoid the appearance of an aoristic interpr.
The verse contains yet another example in Gotama’s collection of
anomalously accented verbs, here bódhati in the sequence sá cā bódhati. Cf. ā́ca
váhāsi (I.74.6), ā́ca huvé (I.76.4), as well as dhákṣi (I.76.3). Although it would be
desirable to have a uniform treatment of these verbs, esp. those following X ca, a
unitary account does not come to mind, and I have explained them in separate ways.
Here I suggest that we read the adverb sácā at the beginning of d and group it with c
(“… pursued the gods altogether”). Lubotsky gives only two examples of lengthened
cā, this one and III.57.5, out of over a thousand occurrences of ca, so, as Old (Noten)
points out, the form is suspect. Old also considers but rejects a reading sácā, though
without giving reasons (beyond “kaum wahrscheinlich”). If sácā goes with the
preceding pāda, bódhāti begins a new clause and its accent is correct. Note that in the
previous hemistich (2ab), yáḥ …, hótā tám ū … ā́kṛṇudhvam, the second pāda begins
141
with a nom. hótā that likewise belongs to the previous pāda, and a new clause begins
with the second word tám, whose clause-initial status is emphasized by following ū.</p>
<h3 id="i773">I.77.3</h3>
<p>Note the verbal play in … ná bhūd ádbhut(asya) …</p>
<h3 id="i774">I.77.4</h3>
<p>There are a number of interconnected difficulties in this verse, mostly focused
on what is happening in cd and the relation of this hemistich with the first one. I take
… ca yé maghávānaḥ … as the second part of an “X and which Y” construction with
naḥ in pāda a in Wackernagel’s Position: “… for us and (for those) who, our
benefactors …” Old (SBE), Re, and WG (if I am reading this last correctly) also
consider “us” and our benefactors to be the conjoined terms, though with differences
in detail. Ge, however, takes the benefactors as conjoined with Agni, and they should
also √vī our hymns and thought along with Agni. The frequency with which
maghávānaḥ (and also sūráyaḥ ‘patrons’) are conjoined with forms of the 1st pl.
favors the non-Ge interpr.
Another issue is the identity of the verb iṣáyanta in d. Ge seems to take it with
the fairly well-established stem iṣáyati ‘prospers, derives benefit’ (“… soll günstig
aufnehmen”), similarly Re (“jouissent”) and WG (“sich … erquicken”). With Old
(SBE) I take it as meaning ‘send, propel’ and ultimately a deverbal formation from
iṣnā́ti, via *iṣāyáti, of the type gṛbhṇā́ti, gṛbhāyáti, gṛbháyati.
The final problem is the form tánā. Ge (/WG) and Re take it as an instr. of
accompaniment “along with their offspring/descendents.” This is not impossible, but
this meaning is ordinarily found in the collocation tanvā́tánā ca (e.g., VI.49.13). By
itself tánā occurs several times with girā́(e.g., I.38.13, II.2.1) “with song at length,”
and I take it that way here as well, semantically construable with mánma ‘prayers’ at
the end of the hemistich.</p>
<h2 id="i78-agni">I.78 Agni</h2>
<p>See the publ. intro. for the structure of this rather dull hymn. Not only is the
third and final pāda identical in the first four (of five) verses, but in these same
verses the opening of the first pāda is also rigidly structured: abhí tvā (vs. 1), tám u
tvā (vss. 2-4). The remainder of the first pāda of these verses consists of two variant
pairs: gótamā girā́(vs. 1), gótamo girā́(vs. 2); vājasā́tamam (vs. 3), vṛtrahántamam.
It is thus only the second pāda of each verse that contains fully independent material.
The tvā in the various a-pādas has a slightly different syntactic status in this
seemingly rigid schema. In vs. 1 it serves as the goal of the verb in pāda c, with
doubling of the preverb abhí (a, c). (Alternatively one can supply a verb in ab and an
object in c, as Ge (/WG) do, but this seems uneconomical.) In the following two
verses it is governed by a verb in pāda b (2 duvasyati, 3 havāmahe), leaving nonumaḥ
in c without an expressed object. In vs. 4 it is again the goal of the verb in c, with an
apparent embedded relative clause in b.</p>
<h3 id="i784">I.78.4</h3>
<p>The use of the epithet vṛtrahán-, esp. in the superlative, for Agni is of course
striking since this is overwhelmingly an Indra descriptor. The name agní- hasn’t yet
142
figured in the hymn, but jā́tavedaḥ in vs. 1 clearly announces him as the recipient of
this praise.
As noted above, the second pāda is technically an embedded relative
(assuming that nonumaḥ in c governs tvā in a).</p>
<h3 id="i785">I.78.5</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., this final verse breaks the pattern of the rest of the
hymn, although it maintains the refrain. The aorist ávocāma “we have spoken” marks
this as a typical summary verse, referring to the activity in the rest of the hymn.</p>
<h2 id="i79-agni">I.79 Agni</h2>
<p>See the publ. intro. for the structure of this hymn (or rather the four hymns
collected here) and for an analysis of the first three verses.</p>
<h3 id="i791">I.79.1</h3>
<p>As Ge notes, the identifications of Agni with sun (a), lightning (b), and fire
(cd) are Ludwig’s.
Most comm. take rájasaḥ as a subjective genitive with visāré (most clearly in
Ge’s “wenn der Raum sich weitet,” referring to morning in his view). I take it rather
to refer to the light of the sun’s rays (his golden hair) spreading through the midspace
at dawn.
The third pāda refers to the blazing up of the ritual fire at dawn. The fourth
pāda consists only of a simile, couched entirely in the feminine plural. The referent
of these feminine adjectives and the point of comparison with Agni are both unclear.
Ge supplies Frauen; Re suggests waters; Old (SBE) waters or dawns. The dawns
seem most likely (so also WG), since a sg. dawn already appears in c and dawns
make sense in this ritual context. Dawns are called apásas ‘busy’ in I.92.3, also a
Gotama hymn, and Uṣas is yáśasvatī in X.11.3. If the feminines are the dawns, the
point of comparison may be śúcibhrājāḥ ‘having bright blazing’, since the dawns are
also bright. If instead it is one of the adjectives in pāda d (‘glorious’ yáśasvatīḥ,
‘busy’ apasyúvaḥ, or ‘actually present’ satyā́ḥ), we must assume that an original
masc. sg. adj. has been attracted into the fem. pl. in the simile – not a problematic
assumption.</p>
<h3 id="i792">I.79.2</h3>
<p>Again, the interpretation of the image in pāda a depends on what the referent
is. Most (Ge, Re, WG) take suparṇā́(ḥ) as referring to Agni’s flames as birds. These
flames transform themselves (ā́… aminanta) into storm clouds. As indicated in the
publ. intro., I instead think this verse develops the image of Agni as lightning found
in 1b. The suparṇā́ḥ are then the lightning flashes. This entails a somewhat bold
interpretation of the verb (though I would say no bolder than ‘transform themselves’,
for which no parallels are cited), from ‘change, exchange, alternate’ to the physical
image ‘zigzag’, from ‘change/alternate back and forth’. The middle of √mī is several
times used of night and dawn swapping their colors back and forth (I.96.5, 113.2),
which can be conceived of as an alternating pattern like zigzags. Against the
flickering light of the lightning there appears the black bull, that is, the thunder cloud,
in b.
143
The nonce perfect nonāva, backformed to the intensive (see the repeated
nonumaḥ of the immed. preceding hymn I.78), I take as presential, with Narten (1981
“Vedisch lelā́ya,” p. 2 with nn. 7, 8, = KlSch. p. 234), against most comm., although
no harm would come of taking it as a preterite.
The pāda-final tag yádīmám is curious. It cannot be part of what precedes,
since nonāva is unaccented. The same phrase is found at IV.5.11, where I tr. “if it is
here.” I interpret it in the same fashion here, but in addition assume an enjambement
with the following pāda. Others keep it within its half verse (which I would prefer),
but in their interpretation the phrase seems like mere filler (e.g., Ge’s “wenn dies (so
ist)”).
The smiling females of c must be the lightning flashes (so also Ge, Re); cf.
V.52.6 vidyútaḥ … jájjhatīr iva “lightning flashes like giggling (girls).” Old (SBE):
rain showers, WG (tentatively): dawns. The “he,” subject of ā́gāt is the black bull of
b, the thundercloud as roaring fire.
For the semantic connection between these parts of the thunderstorm and the
aspects of fire see the publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="i793">I.79.3</h3>
<p>I take ab as a parallel and paraphrase of 2c, with Agni/the thunder cloud
leading (náyan) the lightning flashes, while himself swollen with rain. Others supply
different objects, and a radical (and in my view misguided) view of the passage
makes náyan a 3rd pl. finite verb with Agni as its object – quite awkward because he
is in the nominative in pāda a (píyānaḥ). Those who hold that view resolve the
syntactic problem in ad hoc ways, by emendation (*píyānaṃ Old [SBE],
subsequently rejected in Noten) or by taking ṛtásya páyasā píyānaḥ as a parenthetical
(Re).
It is unclear whether párijmā is meant as an epithet of Varuṇa or a separate
entity. Arguments can be made either way: in VII.40.6 the adjective qualifies wind
and is associated with rain, and having Wind (Vāta) involved in this thunderstorm
context would be understandable. On the other hand, a fourth god would break up the
unity of the standard Āditya triad. The same pāda is found in X.93.4, but in the
context of a longer list of gods.
Ge, Re take the “skin” as that of the earth, but I think it is rather the clouds in
the lower atmosphere. So, more or less, Old (SBE) and WG. Cf. nearby I.62.5

<p>The irregular sandhi of váṣuṣ kavíḥ may be based on that in nearby vidúṣ
kavíḥ in I.71.10, though the hymns are attributed to different poets. On this sandhi
phenomenon in general, see comm. ad VII.18.2.</p>
<h3 id="i796">I.79.6</h3>
<p>I take the point of the double utá construction (probably, with Klein DGRV
359, a nonce based on ca … ca) to be the contrast of the two time periods: at night
Agni must burn against the demons by himself (tmánā), but when Dawn comes, her
light helps him out.

<h3 id="i797">I.79.7</h3>
<p>Since this is the first verse of a hymn in Gāyatrī (vss. 7-9), I take gāyatrásya
as a reference to a composition in that meter, rather than just a song.
On the basis of X.4.1 vándyo no háveṣu, I construe the loc. in c with the
gerundive.</p>
<h3 id="i799">I.79.9</h3>
<p>I supply bhara from 8a; giving the matching verse openings, ā́no, and the
same object ráyim, this seems the correct choice (so also Ge, Re, WG). It would also
be possible to make ráyim here the object of dhehi (so Old [SBE]). There are no
consequences either way.</p>

<p>The middle voice of the impv. bhárasva is correlated with the self-addressed

<p>Old takes śaśā(ḥ) to √śā ‘sharpen’ rather than √śās ‘order’ (as does Re,
judging from his portmanteau and barely comprehensible tr. “as-chassé-comme-enaiguisant”), but there seems no advantage in this. Neither root is found elsewhere
with níḥ, but a literal additive tr. of níḥ √śās works well here. And √śā does not have
a reduplicated form of this shape, whereas √śās has a pf. śaśāsa (etc.), to which this
can be a (plupf.) injunctive. So Kü (521), as well as Gr, etc. The níḥ found in vss. 2
and 4 (also 10), also of the expulsion of Vṛtra, may account for the use of this
preverb here: it seems to be a signature word of this hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i803">I.80.3</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., this verse represents a quoted example of the
“cheering on” alluded to in the refrain.</p>
<h3 id="i804">I.80.4</h3>
<p>Ge suggests that the waters are “accompanied by the Maruts” (marútvatīḥ)
because the waters here are storm-rains. Although in a Marut context this would
seem reasonable, in this Vṛtra-smashing context the waters should not be rain but the
rivers confined by Vṛtra, and this interpretation is in fact possible here. Note that
Sarasvatī, the river par excellence, is called both marútvatī (II.30.8) and marútsakhā
(VII.96.2); this association must be a mediated one: the river is accompanied by or
the companion of the Maruts because their storm-rains swell the rivers.
I.80.5–6: I don’t see any real difference between áva jighnate (5) and ní jighnate (6)
that could account for difference in case frame: acc. in 5, loc. in 6.
145</p>
<h3 id="i807">I.80.7</h3>
<p>In c I supply a preterital form of the redupl. jighnate of the last two verses
(*ájighnathāḥ, though no forms with sec. endings exist to the stem), because the
main clause verb is the suppletive aorist to √han, avadhīḥ.</p>

<p>With Re I take the numbers to refer to the people producing the songs, rather
than the songs or song-types themselves (as in the interpretation of Ge [/WG]). The
problem is that viṃśatíḥ is undeniably nominative, so the tr. “zu zwanzig” (and
parallel “zu tausend”) (Ge, [/WG]) misrepresents the grammar.</p>
<h3 id="i8012">I.80.12</h3>
<p>Ge tr. vépasā as “durch seinen Wortschwall,” with the verbal (“Wort-“)
component presumably on the basis of vípra- ‘inspired poet’. But near-adjacent
vépete in 11b, which refers only to physical trembling with no verbal component, is
surely the word against which to interpret it.
Augmented āyata is one of the few clear occurrences of a thematic med. pres.
to √i.</p>
<h3 id="i8013">I.80.13</h3>
<p>The expression in ab is striking, with Indra presiding over a fight between
Vṛtra and his (=Indra’s) missile, but such is the usage of yodháyati, as opposed to
yúdhyati ‘attacks’ (see Jamison 1983: 151)</p>
<h3 id="i8014">I.80.14</h3>
<p>The phrase yát sthā́jágac ca is curiously formed, though the meaning is
clear. Because the verb rejate is unaccented, the yád cannot mark a “real”
subordinate clause. I wonder if it does not involve the imposition of an “X and which
Y” construction on an indivisible merism. In other words, with an “X and which Y”
we might expect *sthā yác ca jágat “the still and what is moving”; cf. X.88.4 (also
adduced by Ge) sthā́jágad yád with a similarly pleonastic and apparently misplaced
yád. But sthā́jágat is a fixed expression and nothing can be inserted into it.
Note the repetition of cit táva manyáve from 11a, again with a verb of
trembling (vépete 11b, vevijyáte 14d) and an instr. of fear (bhiyásā 11b, bhiyā́14d).</p>
<h3 id="i8015">I.80.15</h3>
<p>ná … káḥ must be read as a negative indefinite (“no one”) despite the

<h3 id="i8016">I.80.16</h3>
<p>Although the first hemistich begins with a rel. pron. (yā́m) and the second
with a form of sá/tám (tásmin), this is not a rel. cl. / main cl. structure, as the
difference in gender between yā́m and tásmin shows. The latter has Indra as referent,
and the former, which modifies dhíyam ‘poetic vision’ in b, is loosely picked up by
bráhmāni … ukthā́“sacred formulations and hymns” in the main clause. In fact, I
think the referent slippage is deliberate, with bráhmāṇi being the culminating product
in our day of the age-old dhī́of ab, attributed to legendary priest-poets. Recall that
this verse is in ring-compositional relationship with vs. 1, where a brahmán- creates
poetry in the new style.

an example of neut. pl. with sg. verb (dhīyate dhánā).</p>
<h3 id="i816">I.81.6</h3>
<p>This verse paraphrases and expands vs. 2. The nominal expression in 2b ási
bhū́ri parādadíḥ is turned into the verb parādádāti in 6b; śikṣasi in 2d is echoed by
śikṣatu in 6c; the phrase bhū́ri te vásu is repeated verbatim (2e, 6d); and the dative
beneficiaries in 2 (yájamānāya 2d, suvaté 2e) are replaced by dāśúṣe (6b) and, more
tellingly, asmábhyam (6c). The source of the wealth that Indra distributes is also
made clear: it belonged to the stranger and is presumably plunder.</p>
<h3 id="i817">I.81.7</h3>
<p>Most tr. render ab in the 3rd ps., but there is no 3rd ps. verb here, and the
phrase is surrounded by 2nd ps. constructions (táva 6e, 2nd ps. impv. gṛbhāya 7c).
Nothing forbids an underlying tvám in ab.
Ge supplies “us” with śiśīhi, but, although this collocation does occur, I don’t
feel it’s necessary in this context.</p>
<h3 id="i819">I.81.9</h3>
<p>On antár √khyā see disc. ad V.30.9. I suggest there that ‘detect’ is a semantic
development of ‘look within’, but also that a diff. tr., ‘distinguish between’ might be
a worthwhile alternative: Indra would be distinguishing between the possessions of
the unworthy, which he should bring to us, and those of the deserving.</p>
<h2 id="i82-indra">I.82 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="i821">I.82.1</h3>
<p>artháyāse owes its accent to íd.</p>
<h3 id="i822">I.82.2</h3>
<p>Most tr. take the two verbs ákṣann ámīmadanta as parallel (e.g., Ge “Sie
haben ja geschmaust, gezecht”), but the position of the hí after the second verb
strongly suggests that the second verb belongs to a separate clause that provides the
causal grounds for another clause. My translation reflects this: “for they have
brought themselves to exhilaration” explains what “they have eaten” actually refers
to: the consumption of soma or soma plus food-offerings. Then in b, as a
consequence of their having received nourishment from us, they repay us with goods.
Most tr. take priyā́(ḥ) in b as nom. pl. masc. referring to the Maruts; this
requires supplying an object for adhūṣata (e.g., Re “des biens”). I take it rather as an
acc. pl. fem., implicitly referring to a fem. noun like íṣaḥ ‘refreshments’; cf. X.134.3
áva tyā́bṛhatī́r íṣaḥ … dhūnuhi “shake down these lofty refreshments,” with the
same VP.
With Old, etc., víprā must be a fem. instr. sg. modifying matī́.
147</p>
<h3 id="i823">I.82.3</h3>
<p>The exact sense of the hapax pūrṇávandhura- ‘having a full chariot box’ is
not entirely clear. Ge suggests that it is full either because Indra has drunk so much
or because he is taking Opfergabe home with him; Re goes for the latter: “plein (de
biens).” This seems unlikely, since Indra is supposed to bring goods to distribute to
us, not take them away with him like party favors. Moreover the vandhúra- appears
to be the place where the charioteer stands (cf. the cmpd vandhureṣṭhā́-, as well as
I.139.4, III.14.3), not a container for cargo. Although a jocular interpretation like
Ge’s is possible, I wonder if a “full chariot box” is simply one that has the driver in
it; in other words, Indra has mounted the chariot and is ready to go. In any case,
pūrṇá- here has to be read in the context of the same word in the next verse.</p>
<h3 id="i824">I.82.4</h3>
<p>I am puzzled by the reference here. The referent of cd, the one who makes
sure Indra’s cup is full, should be the sacrificer, but the sacrificer should not be
mounting Indra’s chariot. We might entertain the possibility that Indra is actually the
referent (and is looking out for his own interests by making sure the cup is full), but,
though switch between persons is very common in the RV, referring to the same
referent in both 2nd and 3rd persons in the same clause does not happen, as far as I
know – and there’s a voc. indra in the 3rd ps. yáḥ … cíketati clause.</p>
<h3 id="i826">I.82.6</h3>
<p>With dadhiṣé we can supply either ‘reins’ or (as sometimes elsewhere with
√dhā and a loc. of ‘hand’) the vájra- (cf., e.g., VI.45.18 dhiṣvá vájraṃ gábhastyoḥ).
The presence of voc. vajrin in d might support the latter interpr.
The Pp. reads amadaḥ in d. This causes interpretational difficulties: Indra was
ordered to leave the ritual ground and drive off to his wife in the immediately
preceding verse; he is still here in this verse, so how can he have already become
exhilarated in the company of his wife? Re must have recognized the problem, given
his tr. “tu t’es (toujours) enivré avec ta femme,” but this doesn’t work very well.
However, nothing prevents us from reading pátnyā madaḥ, with an injunctive, not an
augmented form. It is true that injunctive forms are quite rare to this stem, but this
does not seem to me a decisive argument. (I now see that WG also take it as an
injunctive, independently.)</p>
<h2 id="i83-indra">I.83 Indra</h2>
<h3 id="i831">I.83.1</h3>
<p>Most tr. take vícetas- as ‘perceptive’ vel sim. (Ge “die verständigen (?)
Gewässer,” Re “les eaux discernantes”), but in this context it makes more sense to
use the intransitive sense of the root √cit ‘be perceptible, appear’ rather than the I/T
‘perceive’; hence, with ví, ‘widely perceptible, conspicuous’. The point of the simile
is surely that the goods with which Indra supplies the worshiper are abundant enough
to be easily visible, like the sparkling waters filling a river. Note the case
disharmony: logically the waters are compared not to Indra, but to the goods he
bestows.
148</p>
<h3 id="i832">I.83.2</h3>
<p>This verse presents a number of small problems of interpretation, and it helps
first to determine what the verse is about in general. It seems to involve the gods’
ritual approach to the place of the soma pressing. They are compared to the goddess
waters in a because waters are brought at the soma-pressing to mix with the pressed
soma (cf. IX.69.4, e.g.). The identity of “the one who seeks the gods” (devayú-) in c
is not entirely clear, but my assumption is that it is soma. I also assume that the acc.
in d does not refer to the soma, but rather to the priest-poet, though it is not
impossible that the two accusatives have the same referent, most likely in that case
the priest-poet.
In b (with Ge [/WG]) I take the shared term of the simile to be vítatam
‘extended, extensive’. Both Ge and WG supply “Opfer” in the frame, but I would
suggest that it is, more specifically, the soma-filter, which is elsewhere so qualified.
Cf. IX.83.2 tápoṣ pavítraṃ vítataṃ divás padé, where the filter has cosmic
dimensions, as it would here.
In d brahmaprī́- is universally taken as ‘loving the formulation’, and this
interpr. would match that of brahma-dvíṣ- ‘hating the formulation’. However, both
here and in its other occurrence in I.152.6 I take it instead as ‘pleasing [someone]
with the formulation’ with the transitive value of act. prīṇā́ti, etc. In this passage it
makes more sense that the gods would delight in someone attempting to please them,
rather than someone who is himself deriving pleasure from something else. The
passage in I.152.6 invites a similar interpr.</p>
<h3 id="i833">I.83.3</h3>
<p>With Ge (/WG) I take the two as the Hotar and Adhvaryu priests, with pāda a
appropriate to the former and b to the latter. Although it is something of a surprise to
find the charged word mithunā́, which is usually used of a sexual pairing, applied to
two males, it is presumably because the two priests have complementary duties. I do
not think that it refers to the sacrificer and his wife, contra Old (flg. Benfey). As I
have argued at length elsewhere (Jamison 2011, 2016 [UTexas Vedic conf.], and
forthcoming [World Skt. Conf. Edinburgh]), I consider the ritual Patnī to be a ritual
role introduced only in the late RV and very controversial at that time, and I doubt
that she would be so casually alluded to here.</p>
<h3 id="i834">I.83.4</h3>
<p>Assuming a thematic stem áṅgira- here is unavoidable, next to the far more
common s-stem áṅgiras-.
In order to give ā́d its usual temporal reading (“just after that”), I follow Old
in assuming that pāda b provides the grounds for the Aṅgirases’ acquisition of lifeforce.
The standard tr. (Ge, Re, WG) take prathamám … váyaḥ as a syntagm (“first
youth,” vel sim.), whereas I take prathamám as an adverb. Their evidence is VII.97.1
prathamáṃ váyaś ca, but there the position of ca favors separation of prathamám and
váyaḥ. See comm. ad loc.
Ge and Re supply a verb in d, but this seems unnecessary; the accusatives
here can simply expand on bhójanam in c.
149</p>
<h3 id="i835">I.83.5</h3>
<p>This verse seems to jumble together a lot of primal mythology that does not
seem to be connected (or, rather, whose connection eludes me). As noted in the publ.
intro., vss. 4–5 describe the first institution of the sacrifice and touch on a number of
the primordial players. It is esp. noteworthy (but I don’t quite know what to do with
it) that vs. 4 contains the Aṅgirases and vs. 5 Atharvan, reminding us of the old
designation for the Atharva Veda, atharvāṅgirasaḥ (see, e.g., Bloomfield, Intro. to
Hymns of the Atharvarveda [SBE 42, 1897]).
The form tate is a pseudo-perfect to √tan; at this period we would expect
*tatne (which we in fact get at X.130.2). The light root-syllable is metrically
guaranteed. Kü (210) points out that it is formed as if to a root √tā, and such a root
morpheme could have been extracted from the passive tāyáte. I would add that, as
with many aberrant forms, the context invites this form: note the immediately
following word, opening the next pāda, tátaḥ (recall also vítatam in 2b).
Note the chaining of ā́jani (b) … ājat (c) … jātám (d), with the middle term
belonging to a different root (√aj) from the first and last (√jan).</p>
<h3 id="i836">I.83.6</h3>
<p>The relation between the three subordinate clauses (abc) and the main clause
is irregular in that tásya in d does not pick up a relative pronominal referent. I take it
as referring to the sacrificer who has been regularly present in the hymn (the presenttime vss. 1-3). Ge and Re may well be right that the kārú- ‘bard’ of c, which is
identified with the pressing stone, is its logical referent.</p>
<h2 id="i84-indra">I.84 Indra</h2>
<p>See the publ. intro. for the structure of this composite hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i841">I.84.1</h3>
<p>Unlike the standard tr., WG take rájaḥ ‘Raum’ with the frame, not the simile:
“… soll dich (und) den Raum erfüllen, wie die Sonne …” I assume this is because
the simile particle ná, which usually follows the first word of a simile, here follows
the second word, by most interpretations (rájaḥ sū́ryo ná raśmíbhiḥ). This does not
seem to me sufficient reason to split apart this cosmological image. I attribute the
position of ná to the particularly close association of sū́rya- and raśmíbhiḥ, which are
frequently adjacent (cf. esp. the identical simile but without a third term … sū́ryo ná
raśmíbhiḥ in VIII.43.32, IX.41.5).</p>
<h3 id="i842">I.84.2</h3>
<p>Note the chiasmic structure of cd: [ṛ́ṣīṇāṃ (GEN.) ca stutī́ḥ (ACC.)] úpa
[yajñáṃ (ACC.) ca mā́nuṣānām (GEN.)]. This could have been sketched in tr. by “up to
the seers’ praises and the sacrifice of the sons of Manu.”
I.84.7–9: Bloomfield (RR, ad I.7.8) suggests that each of these three verses reads like
a brahmodya, with the last two words (the four-syllable tag índro aṅgá, which he
considers to be prose “quite out of the metre”) serving as the answer. This analysis
words best for vs. 7, but his separation of the two-word tag from the rest of the verse
is clearly correct for all three verses &ndash; though I do not think we need to consider
índro aṅgá “simple prose.”
150</p>
<h3 id="i847">I.84.7</h3>
<p>I take índro aṅgá as the main clause corresponding to the rel. cl. introduced
by yáḥ.</p>
<h3 id="i848">I.84.8</h3>
<p>The hapax kṣúmpa- is universally rendered by modern tr. as ‘mushroom’,
though there is no unanimity in earlier interpretations (cf., e.g., Gr: Staude [perennial
plant]). There is some etymological support for ‘mushroom’ from modern languages
(see EWA s.v.), and ‘mushroom’ works well in the simile, since kicking many
varieties of mushroom demolishes them, whereas a perennial plant is generally a
sturdier entity. I might go so far as to suggest specifically a puffball, since kicking
puffballs releases a satisfying cloud of dust (easily viewed on various YouTube
videos), and puffballs do appear to be found in the appropriate geographical area.</p>
<h3 id="i849">I.84.9</h3>
<p>A broken construction. The subject of the 3rd ps. verb in c (patyate) must be
Indra, though he is represented by 2nd ps. tvā in the apparent rel. cl. of ab. (The
parallel in III.36.4b ugráṃ śávaḥ patyate dhṛṣṇv ójaḥ, where Indra is undeniably the
subject, makes it clear that the mortal soma-presser of our ab cannot be the subject of
patyate.) The yá- clause of ab thus has no direct grammatical connection with what
ought to be its main clause in c, and I therefore take yáś cid as the functional
equivalent of the indefinite káś cid.
I.84.10-12: See publ. intro. for the structure of this tṛca and its relation to I.80. The
subjects of all three verses are feminine (gauryàḥ, yā́ḥ … sayā́varīḥ 10; tā́(ḥ) …
pṛ́śnayaḥ, … dhenávaḥ 11; tā́(ḥ) 12; vásvīḥ 10-12), but, in my opinion, the hidden
referent of all three verses is the Maruts. See also comm. on vs. 16.</p>
<h3 id="i8410">I.84.10</h3>
<p>Ge (followed by Re, WG) takes the feminine plurals as referring to the milk
streams, mixing with the soma, here called honey. This of course accords well with
the feminine gender, and I agree that this is the first layer of reference. But both the
refrain, echoing the refrain of I.80, which has the Maruts as one set of subjects, and
sayā́varīḥ ‘fellow travellers, driving along with’ point to the Maruts as a second layer.
The adj. sayā́van- is used 3x (out of 6) with the instr. pl. of devá-, once (X.113.2)
quite clearly of the Maruts along with Indra. Why would the hyper-masculine Maruts
be referred to with feminines? I think the point is to conflate two of the sources of
Indra’s mastery: the soma-milk mixture animatized as cows, which enhances his
physical strength, and the Maruts, who provide verbal encouragement and moral
support.
I construe instr. vṛ́ṣṇā with sayā́varīḥ rather than with mádanti as most tr. do.
The latter is of course possible.</p>
<h3 id="i8411">I.84.11</h3>
<p>This verse contains another clue that the Maruts are the underlying referent.
The fem. subjects are identified as pṛ́śnayaḥ ‘dappled’, but pṛ́śni- is also the name of
the Maruts’ mother. They would be called Pṛśnis here, just as they are regularly
called Rudras, after their father Rudra.
151
Note the phonetic figure pr̥śanāyúvaḥ &hellip; pṛ́śnayaḥ.</p>
<h3 id="i8413">I.84.13</h3>
<p>The use of the bones of Dadhyañc as a vajra-substitute is a particularly
puzzling part of this puzzling version of the Dadhyañc myth. The appearance of this
motif in the JB and MBh versions (see Ge n. on vss. 13–15) seems to me an afterthe-fact rationalization of the verse here.</p>
<h3 id="i8414">I.84.14</h3>
<p>The syntax of this verse is somewhat unclear. I take ab as a rel. clause with
the pres. part. ichán functioning as the main verb and an unusual, indeed disturbing,
position of the rel. pron. yád (we might expect *ichán yád áśvasya …), which is then
picked up by tád in the main clause of c. Most other tr. take ichán as part of the main
clause and the yád as the marker of an embedded rel. cl.: roughly “seeking the head
of the horse, which was set away in the mountains, he found it…” But not only
would I prefer not to allow embedded relatives in the RV, but the position of yád
makes this interpretation difficult, too (expect *ichánn áśvasya śíraḥ yád …?).</p>
<h3 id="i8415">I.84.15</h3>
<p>I confess myself to be entirely baffled by this verse, though the grammar is
straightforward. Ge’s reconstruction of the mythology (n. to vs. 15) is not entirely
compelling, nor is that found in WG.</p>
<h3 id="i8416">I.84.16</h3>
<p>The consensus of modern tr. is that the objects that the subject is struggling
to yoke are the priests (see esp. Ge), but I find this unlikely. The violent adjectival
descriptors seem uncharacteristic for priests, but quite suitable for the Maruts, to
whom the poet of this hymn (now drawing to a close) will dedicate the next four
hymns. Note esp. that both śímivant- and mayobhū́- are used of the Maruts, once in
the same hymn (VIII.20.3 and 24 respectively; for mayobhū́- see also I.166.3,
V.58.2). I therefore take the Maruts as referents of the acc. pls. and also suggest that
this verse is the pivot for the Marut reference found also (in my interpretation) in vss.
10–12. In that tṛca the Maruts are referred to in the guise of clearly feminine bovine
figures; here the cattle (gā́ḥ) are the first acc. object we encounter. Because gó- has
fluctuating gender, this form can of course be feminine (as the bovines were in 10–
12), but the immediate following adjectives establish it decisively as masculine. If
both 10–12 and this verse refer to the Maruts, this verse returns them to their proper
grammatical gender. Lüders (Varuṇa II.455) also thinks the Maruts are the referents.
ṛtásya can be construed with either dhurí or gā́ḥ, and tr. divide on which they
choose. I attach it to the chariot pole in part because ṛtásya is often construed with a
place (e.g., frequent ṛtásya yóni-), but the other is not impossible: cf. I.73.6 r̥tásya &hellip;
dhenávaḥ.</p>
<h3 id="i8417">I.84.17</h3>
<p>Contra the interpretation of íbha- as ‘elephant’ in Vedic (so Ge), see EWA
s.v.</p>
<h3 id="i8418">I.84.18</h3>
<p>yajātai is, as far as I can tell, the only RVic examples of a medial 3rd sg.
subjunctive in -tai, the form that takes over beginning with the AV, spreading from
152
the 1st sg. As such it may be a sign that at least this part of this last hymn in the Indra
group is late.
Pāda c presents a problem that has been glossed over by most modern tr.: the
active of ā́√vah should take an acc. of what is being conveyed, but it is distinctly
odd to say that the gods are bringing the oblation here. Ge (Re, WG) avoid the
difficulty by interpreting the verb as intrans. ‘fahren’ (/‘arriver-en-char’), a usage
associated with the middle, with hóma an acc. of goal. Old, however, disapproves of
this makeshift (as do I), setting out the arguments very clearly. Though he agrees that
“der Gedanke befremdet,” he sticks to the expected syntax (as do I) and cites a
number of passages in which gods do bring oblations. The closest is V.41.7 in which
Night and Dawn bring the sacrifice to the mortal (V.41.7d ā́hā vahato mártyāya
yajñám). I suggest that the role-switch in this verse (gods bring the oblation, rather
than coming to our oblation to take it away) is also found in the next verse, where the
god praises the mortal.</p>
<h3 id="i8419">I.84.19</h3>
<p>As in the last verse the usual ritual roles of god and mortal are reversed, with
Indra producing a praśasti of a mortal. I do not understand why, but, unlike 18c,
there is no way to wriggle out of the undeniable purport of this verb phrase – thus
supporting the “gods convey the oblation” interpretation of 18c.

<h3 id="i851">I.85.1</h3>
<p>Because of the frequent association of the root √śu(m)bh with verbs of motion,
esp. √yā ‘drive’ (cf., e.g., nearby I.88.2 śubhé káṃ yānti and cmpds śubhaṃ-yā́(van-
)), I interpret prá … śúmbhante more dynamically than most tr. (e.g., Ge “Die sich
wie Frauen schön machen…”), esp. given yā́man in the same clause.
The connection of the relative clause in pāda a with its presumed main clause
in d is interrupted by the hí clause in c. Ge convincingly suggests that the hí clause
gives an explanation or exemplification of the “wondrous power” attributed to them
in the last word of b, sudáṃsasaḥ, and he is followed by most tr. including me.
This clause contains a periphrastic causative cakriré vṛdhé with a medial
perfect as its base (see Zehnder, Das periphrastische Kausativ im Vedischen, pp. 23,
50–51). Although there is no doubt that the construction is a periphrasis, the reason
for its use is unclear. As Zehnder points out (pp. 23, 51), the imperfect of the well-
153
attested morphological causative occurs with just this object in VIII.12.7 yát …
ródasī ávardhayat. The context here, which contains two present indicatives
(śúmbhante a, mádanti d), does not call for a perfect. I suspect (but cannot
demonstrate) that the use of this periphrasis with the perfect has something to do
with the middle voice of cakriré, which is also apparently unmotivated in the
periphrastic construction, and that there is an underlying pun &ndash; on rodasī́, the consort
of the Maruts &ndash; namely “the Maruts made the two worlds/*Rodasī their own” (ródasī
… cakriré), which would require a medial form. Since, as I demonstrated long ago
(“Voice Fluctuation in the Rig Veda: Medial 3rd Plural -anta in Active Paradigms”
IIJ 21 [1979]), 3rd pl. medial secondary forms in -anta to -áya-formations are almost
universally interpretable as re-marked actives in -an, using *avardhayanta here
would not allow the proposed double reading, with a true medial value in the pun. A
different pun is also possibly latent here, involving a reflexive reading of the middle:
“they made themselves grow strong” (cakriré vṛdhé). This interpretation would feed
naturally into the beginning of verse 2: tá ukṣitā́saḥ “once grown,” and 7a té
‘vardhanta svátavaso mahitvanā́“Those self-powerful ones strengthened themselves
in their greatness” would echo this reflexive interpretation. In both of these
suggested puns, one of the words in the pāda has to be ignored (vṛdhé in the first,
ródasī in the second), but the suggestive if partial phraseology in both cases would
resonate with the audience.
It is also worth noting (though I don’t quite know what to do with this fact)
that of the fifteen occurrences of cakriré / cakrire in the RV, four of them are found
in this hymn (vss. 2, 7, 10 in addition to this one), a strikingly large percentage. And
that the three finite verbs in vs. 2 are all medial 3rd pl. with strong subject
involvement: pāda a mahimā́nam āśata “obtained (their own) greatness,” b cakrire
sádaḥ “made (their own) seat,” and c ádhi śríyo dadhire “put on (their own)
splendours.”</p>
<h3 id="i852">I.85.2</h3>
<p>On the verbs in this verse, see final comments on vs. 1.</p>
<h3 id="i853">I.85.3</h3>
<p>The pf. dadhire of b is not in harmony with the three pres. forms, śubháyante
a, bā́dhante b, rīyate c; in particular, the tenses of the subordinate-main clause dyad
in ab clash: “when they beautify themselves …, they have put on …” (The tr. avoids
the clash by using simply ‘put’, ambiguous between present and past in English, but
the Sanskrit is not so amenable.) It is difficult to wring a stative/resulative meaning
(“they have put on and now have on …”) out of dadhire, esp. given the identical
form in preterital use in 2d. It may be best to assume that dadhire here just echoes the
form in 2d, though it might be worth noting that the 3rd pl. mid. present indicative to
the redupl. pres., dádhate, which we might expect here, is quite rare. However, there
is another possible solution to this clash. The pres. śubháyante in the yád clause in
pāda a appears before vowel-initial añjíbhiḥ in the cadence, with, as is usual, the final
-e scanning short in hiatus (that is, probably as *-ay
). It is possible that the underlying
form of the verb was actually the injunctive *śubháyanta and that the primary ending
-ante was substituted editorially to prevent the redactional contraction that might
154
have resulted (*śubháyantāñjíbhiḥ). This would allow a past-time reading of the first
hemistich, “When they beautified themselves …, they put on …”</p>
<h3 id="i854">I.85.4</h3>
<p>This verse contains no main clause, just two different subordinate clauses
introduced by yé (ab) and yád (cd) respectively, with the first couched in the 3rd ps.,
the second in the 2nd ps. Although such switches of person in the middle of a verse
are far from rare in the RV (see in fact vs. 5), in this case it seems best to consider
the first half of this verse a pendant to vs. 3 (also in the 3rd ps.) and the second half an
anticipation of vs. 5 (also in the 2nd ps.), esp. since 5a is an abbreviated duplicate of
4cd.
The adj. manojúvaḥ ‘mind-swift’ could equally well be a nom. pl. masc.
modifying the Maruts or an acc. pl. fem. modifying pṛ́ṣatīḥ. Most tr. opt for the latter,
I think correctly on thematic grounds, but grammatically and semantically either is
possible. Gr and Macd (Vedic Reader) take it as a nominative; certainly its position
right before marutaḥ in pāda a, with pŕṣatīḥ appearing only in the middle of the
second pāda, suggests that the initial audience interpretation would be as a modifier
of the Maruts.
I.85.4–5: Verse 5 is an intrusive Triṣṭubh in this Jagatī hymn. (The final verse is also
in Triṣṭubh, but meter change is more usual in concluding verses.) The transition
between the meters is cleverly managed here (as Old already pointed out): the final
word of 4d (in Jagatī) and 5a (in Triṣṭubh) is áyugdhvam. The ending has the
distracted reading -dhu
vam in 4d, but is simply -dhvam in 5a. The reason for the
change in meter is unclear to me.</p>
<h3 id="i855">I.85.5</h3>
<p>As noted ad vs. 4, the person changes from 2nd to 3rd in the middle of this
verse. But this is not the only disruption: the main clause of 5cd begins with utá,
which has nothing to conjoin. Klein (DGRV I: 451) is puzzled and suggests,
somewhat desperately, that the utá “focuses on and emphasizes the second action of
the Maruts.” This seems to open the usage of utá unacceptably wide. It is possible
instead to see it as an example of “inverse utá,” conjoining the actions of the two
clauses of cd, with the parallel verbs ví ṣyanti and vy undanti (so also explicitly Macd,
Reader). Or it may be signaling the resumption of 3rd ps. discourse after the 2nd ps.
intrusions of 4cd–5ab.
The inundation of the skin in pāda 4 presumably refers to the wetting of hides

<h3 id="i856">I.85.6</h3>
<p>In vs. 1 the Maruts were themselves called sáptayaḥ ‘spans’, but here that
image is “repaired” by separating the Maruts from the spans of draught animals that
bring them here.
The two raghu- cmpds. pick up raṃháyantaḥ in 5b.
The phrase urú vaḥ sádas kṛtám could technically be in apposition to barhíḥ
and hence accusative &ndash; “Sit on the barhis, the broad seat made for you” &ndash; but none
of the standard tr. so render it. The position of the vaḥ favors, but does not impose,
155
this nominal sentence interpretation. For another reason supporting a separation into
two clauses see comm. ad I.85.7.
The seat made for the Maruts on the ritual ground is here contrasted with the
one they made for themselves in heaven in 2b (diví … ádhi cakrire sádaḥ), which
event is then repeated in the next verse, 7b urú cakrire sádaḥ, though there the seat is
in/on/above the “vault” (nā́kam).</p>
<h3 id="i857">I.85.7</h3>
<p>I tr. avardhanta as reflexive, rather than (with most tr.) intransitive ‘grew
strong’, in part because svátavas- suggests that their power comes by their own
efforts and in part because of its resonance with one interpretation of 1c, for which
see above.
On pāda b see comments ad 6c and the similar phrase in 2b. The accent of the
apparent main verb tasthúḥ is surprising. Macd (Reader) invokes the principle that
the first of two antithetical verbs is accented, but this seems a feeble explanation of
this particular situation. Ordinarily such antithetical verbs are adjacent to each other
and the semantic antithesis is clearer: “they mounted” and “they made” do not seem
particularly antithetical. I see two possible explanations: either the ā́… tasthúḥ
clause should be taken as an unmarked subordinate clause (“[when] they mounted the
vault, they made …”) or the “antithetical” explanation is correct, but the verb to
which it is antithetical is not the following cakrire. Instead it is found in 6c, whose
two clauses are in patterned contrast to 7b:
6c sī́datā́barhír urú vah sádas kṛtám
7c ā́nā́kaṃ tasthúr urú cakrire sádaḥ
The second part of both pādas contains urú sádaḥ √kṛ; the first parts contain the
preverb ā́, main verbs built to the semantically oppositional roots √sad ‘sit’ (sī́data)
and √sthā ‘stand’ (tasthúḥ), and an acc. of goal, again oppositional, in that the barhíḥ
of 6c is on the earthly ritual ground and the nā́kam is in heaven. I therefore think it
likely that the accent on tasthúḥ is meant to signal the contrastive relationship
between the two pādas.
The Pp. analyses dhā́vad as ha ā́vat, and most tr. follow this interpretation, as
containing an imperfect of √av ‘help’ (Ge “Als Viṣṇu dem … Bullen … beistand…”;
Re “eut aidé”; Macd “helped”). (An injunctive ávat would also be possible.)
However, we are likely dealing with a double, or even a triple, word play here, for
dhā́vat can also simply be the 3rd sg. injunctive belonging to the root (or rather roots)
√dhāv ‘rinse’ and ‘run’. This is recognized by WG, who translate with the second,
“Als Viṣṇu zu dem vom Rausch bewegten Stier läuft…,” but in the notes also raise
the possibility of ‘rinse’, referring to Gotō (Präsensklasse p. 186 n. 333), who in turn
refers to Pirart (IIJ 27 [1984] 102ff.).
I think that the two primary readings are “rinsed” and “aided” and that the acc.
object vṛ́ṣaṇaṃ madacyútam has different referents depending on the interpretation
of the verb, namely soma and Indra respectively. This ambiguity is made possible by
the fact that vṛ́ṣan- ‘bull’ is very commonly used of both Indra and soma. The
modifying cmpd. madacyút- also has two different interpretations, enabled by the
functional ambiguity of root noun compounds like this. Root noun second members
156
regularly have transitive force, governing their first members, hence here “arousing
exhilaration.” And in fact this compound is common in this sense, modifying soma
(IX.12.3, etc.). But passive value of the root noun with an instrumental or other
oblique sense of the 1st member is also possible, hence here “roused by the
exhilarating drink / roused to exhilaration.” For general disc. see Scarlatta pp. 128–
29. In this second sense Indra would be the obvious referent, as he is elsewhere (e.g.,
I.51.2).
While ‘rinse’ may strike the casual reader as an odd choice of words, in fact
rinsing is one of the standard steps in the preparation of soma. For Viṣṇu’s
participation in this process, see VI.17.11cd pūṣā́víṣṇus trī́ṇi sárāṃsi dhāvan,
vrtrahánam mad ̥ íram aṃśúm asmai “Pūṣan, Viṣṇu (and the others) rinse the
exhilarating Vrtra ̥ -smashing plant, three lakes (full), for him [=Indra].” In the ‘aided’
interpretation, Indra is the referent of the accusative and the allusion is to Viṣṇu’s
help given to him in various exploits including the Vṛtra-smashing. In the “ran to”
reading, which strikes me as the least interesting, presumably Indra is also the
referent of the accusative, though WG don’t make this exactly clear.</p>
<h3 id="i859">I.85.9</h3>
<p>The array of tenses in this verse requires comment. The subordinate–main
clause dyad of ab/c contains an imperfect ávartayat in the yád clause and a present
dhatté (dhattá in sandhi) in the main clause. Pāda d, which describes actions that
necessarily follow the one in pāda c, then has two imperfects (áhan and aubjat). I
consider the imperfect / present combination in the first sentence to be a makeshift
attempt to convey anteriority in a language without a semantic pluperfect. That is,
there is no structural means in Rigvedic Sanskrit to convey past anterior action
(“when he had X-ed, he Y-ed”) via a finite verb (though see recent work by IH with a
contrary opinion), since the “pluperfect” is simply the past tense to presential
perfects. In later Sanskrit the gerund serves as a non-finite way to express the value
(“having X-ed, he Y-ed”), but the gerund barely exists in the RV. In the RV the
perfect participle does serve this function, in contrast to finite forms of the perfect
system. Here the relative tense values are conveyed by the imperfect followed by the
present, since the imperfect does express action prior to that of the present tense. The
imperfects in pāda d then re-establish the past-time context. I therefore tr. the
imperfect and present of abc with the English pluperfect and preterite.
On náry ápāṃsi see disc. ad VIII.96.19.</p>
<h3 id="i8511">I.85.11</h3>
<p>Old suggests a clever, but ultimately unsatisfactory, reading in pāda a: rather
than táyā diśā́with the Pp., he divides tá(y) ādíśā, with the instr. of ādíś- and the
older sandhi form of té ‘they’. This would make the end of the pāda more parallel to
10a … tá ójasā. He thinks that the Maruts performed the action in 10a with brute
force, but that in 11a “durch klugen Anschlag.” Although I am drawn to this idea
because of the persistent parallelisms in this hymn, I cannot accept it in the end. For
one thing ādíś- does not occur in the instr., and it generally means ‘aim, intention’,
which does not fit here. Old’s proposed reading also involves altering the accent
from diśā́to ādíśā, so that it is not merely a matter of redividing the Saṃhitā text.
157
There is also the serious question of why tái̯would be preserved in one prevocalic
environment but not in another, in adjacent vss.
The sequence ā́gachantīm in c appears to contain the 3rd pl. pres. gachanti +
īm; this is certainly the default interpretation. However, as with vidántīm in I.67.4
and várdhantīm in I.65.4, I now think it should be analyzed as gachant + īm, an
injunctive with the inherited *-ant ending preserved because it was early misanalyzed
the primary ending fused with the enclitic pronoun īm. Vss. 11 relates how the
Maruts brought rain to “thirsting Gotama”; the first two pādas contain preterities (pf.
nunudre, impf. ásiñcan; note also vs. 10, devoted to the same theme, with 3 pfs.
nunudre, bibhiduḥ, cakrire), while pāda d has the functionally ambiguous injunc.
tarpayanta. Only present gachanti intrudes. The publ. tr. moves from past to present
in vs. 11 (allowing for a presential reading of tarpayanta): “They pushed the well
aslant in this way. They poured out the wellspring for the thirsting Gotama. / They
come hither to him with help &ndash; they of bright radiance. They satisfy the desire of the
inspired poet through their own essential qualities.” But the narrative sequence
would flow better with “they came … they satisfied,” and I would emend the
published translation accordingly. For this and other such passages (esp. I.65.4 and
I.85.11), see my “Hidden in Plain Sight: Some Older Verb Endings in the Rig Veda”
in a forthcoming festschrift.</p>
<h2 id="i86-maruts">I.86 Maruts</h2>
<p>On the structure of this hymn and its syntactic patterns, see publ. intro.</p>
<h3 id="i861">I.86.1</h3>
<p>I do not understand the function of hí here, which is doubly unusual in
occurring both in a relative clause and in the initial clause of a hymn. Hettrich
(Hypotaxe, p. 181) also finds it puzzling. Finding hí in the opening pāda of a hymn is
not unprecedented (cf., e.g., IV.1.1, VI.1.1, VI.2.1), but the relative clause is a further
complication.
The abl. diváḥ is construed by Ge and Re with the voc. vimahasaḥ (Ge “ihr
ausgezeichneten (Mannen) des Himmels”), but we might expect it to lose its accent
in the vocative phrase, like divo naraḥ (II.36.2, V.54.10) and divo duhitar (IV.51.10,
etc.). It is better taken with √pā ‘protect’, which is elsewhere found with the ablative
(e.g., X.158.1 sū́ryo no divás pātu), indicating the location of the protector and hence
the direction from which the protection comes. So also WG.
I.86.2–3: As discussed in the publ. intro., the syntax of these two verses is to be
interpreted in the template provided by vs. 1, namely a relative clause (or clauses)
expressing the beneficiary of the Maruts’ favor with the genitive yásya and a main
clause assigning a reward to him. The full structure is seen in 1ab (rel. cl. with yásya)
/ 1c main clause with coreferential sá. Verses 2 and 3ab serve as the relative clauses
to the main clause of 3c, also beginning sá. However, the relative pronoun is
suppressed until 3a and the structure of parallel relative clauses is only conveyed by
the repeated vā ‘or’ (2a, 2b, 3a). Indeed, though 2b contains a genitive of the human
beneficiary (víprasya), 2a lacks even that: we must infer a yásya to limit the yajñaíḥ,
158
as well as a verb to construe with that instrumental. I would diagram the structure as
follows, with what is to be supplied in parentheses:
template, vs. 1:
yásya … pāthā́(2nd ps. pl. verb) (1ab) / sá
for whom … you Maruts perform benevolent action (1c) / he is (rewarded)
complex variation, vss. 2-3
(yásya) yajñaíḥ vā (2nd ps. verb) (2a)
or by (whose) sacrifices (you were attracted?)
(yásya) víprasya vā … śṛṇutā́(2bc)
or of (which) poet … you heard
utá vā yásya vājínaḥ … átakṣata (3ab) / sá
or of which prize-seeker … you fashioned / he is (rewarded)
This interpretation differs significantly from that of other tr. In particular, vs. 2 is
generally taken as an independent sentence that does not parallel the yásya structures
of vss. 1 and 3 and that has śṛṇutā́as the verb of a main clause, not of a subordinate
clause, as I take it. (By that account śṛṇutā́is accented because it follows the extraclausal vocative that opens the pāda.) Although my interpretation requires several
elements to be supplied, esp. in vs. 2, most other tr. also supply a verb with 2ab, and
they fail to capture the structural parallelism that allows the ellipses to be filled in a
principled fashion.</p>
<h3 id="i862">I.86.2</h3>
<p>My interpretation requires matīnā́m to be construed with hávam “the call of
the thoughts”; for this expression see, e.g., VI.69.4 hávanā matīnā́m.</p>
<h3 id="i863">I.86.3</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., I take the vājín- here to be the patron, for whom
the Maruts create a worthy poet.
I take gántā as a periphrastic future. VII.32.10 gámat sá gómati vrajé is
entirely parallel, save for having a subjunctive (gámat) in place of the agent noun
here, which suggests a future sense for the latter.
I.86.4–5: As indicated in the publ. intro., the genitive of the human worshiper is
continued in these verses, though with the demonstrative, not relative pronoun.</p>
<h3 id="i865">I.86.5</h3>
<p>The condensed expression of the earlier part of the hymn continues here, and
there is no consensus on how to construe pāda c, which has no overtly signaled
connection with the rest of the verse. For example, Ge takes it as a simile, marked by
cid, with its comparandum in pāda b (roughly, “who dominates the peoples like the
flowing nourishments the sun”). But even if cid could mark similes (and I don’t think
it can), the simile doesn’t make sense. I will not rehash here the various possibilities
159
floated by other interpretations. My own generally follows Renou’s in supplying
asyá from 1a as the oblique predicate of a possessive nominal sentence: “(his) are …”
It would also be possible to take the perfect participle sasrúṣīḥ as the predicate: so
WG “Sogar zur Sonne sind (seine) Nahrungen gelaufen (erreicht),” but the exact
value of such a predicated perfect participle eludes me.</p>
<h3 id="i866">I.86.6</h3>
<p>There is an abrupt shift from the unidentified 3rd sg. worshiper rewarded for
his work who dominated vss. 1–5 to the 1st ps. plural, but the rhetorical structure
invites the audience to identify the “us” of vs. 6 with the 3rd sg. of the earlier verse.
The dadāśimá ‘we have done pious work’, combined with the causal hí ‘for’, seems
to offer a summary of the activities of the previous verses. The repetition of the pl.
carṣaní- in 5b and 6c also supports this identification: he who “dominated” the
carṣaní- in 5b can be the same as the “we” who accomplished what we have done
with the help of the carṣaní- in 6c. This lexical chaining should have been signaled in
the translation, where instead the two words are rendered differently: “bordered
domains” (5b), “separate peoples” (6c). I would now use “separate peoples” also for
5b.</p>
<h3 id="i867">I.86.7</h3>
<p>The 3rd sg. protagonist and the syntactic structure of vss. 1–5 return here, but
with the syntax reversed: sá … yásya.</p>
<h3 id="i868">I.86.8</h3>
<p>I take the vā here as inverse, connecting the two double gen. phrases
śaśamānásya … svédasya and kā́masya vénataḥ, though it appears after the first word
of the first gen. phrase (śaśamānásya vā … svédasya …). Klein (DGRV II: 205) also
thinks an inverse reading is possible (though he doesn’t use the term), but he also
suggests vā here might be equivalent to vaí. This seems unnecessary, and the inverse
interpretation gets some support from the inversion of the syntax in vs. 7.
Note the chiastic structure of the two genitive phrases: in the first the personal
participle śaśamānásya depends on the material svédasya, while the likewise
personal participle vénataḥ depends on kā́masya.</p>
<h3 id="i869">I.86.9</h3>
<p>The first two pādas show a nice syntactic conversion: the 2nd member śávasof the voc. bahuvrīhi satya-śavas- ‘having real strength’ (unaccented, but would be
satyá-śavas-) is implicitly extracted from the compound and represented by tát,
object of āvíṣ karta.
The third pāda has a striking phonetic figure vídhyatā vidyútā, which was
already anticipated by pāda-initial vidā́in 8c.</p>
<h3 id="i8610">I.86.10</h3>
<p>Another phonetic figure in a: gū́hatā guhyàm, whose -atā also echoes
vídhyatā.
In the publ. tr. guhyàm would have been better rendered as “to be concealed”
than “concealable,” since the concealment is not merely possible but desirable.</p>

<h3 id="i871">I.87.1</h3>
<p>Ge tr. usrā́(ḥ) as “Sternbilder (?)” because he considers the interpretation with

<h3 id="i872">I.87.2</h3>
<p>On upahvará- see disc. ad I.62.6.</p>
<h3 id="i874">I.87.4</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., in contradistinction to all standard tr. I take the
gaṇáḥ of d to refer to the poet Gautama, whose patronymic is Rāhūgaṇa, and
consider the 2nd sg. reference of the 2nd hemistich as Gautama’s self-address. The
other tr. assume that the flock of Maruts is being addressed.
All standard tr. also take pāda d as a single clause (e.g., Ge “darum ist die
bullenhafte Schar ein Gönner dieser Dichtung”). But this interpretation fails to
account for the medial position of áthā, which is otherwise almost invariably initial.
(Klein, DGRV II: 70–71, notes the anomalous position here but follows the standard
tr.) I take áthā as clause initial, proclaiming Gotama’s identification with the Marut
flock on the basis of the shared qualities stated previously.</p>
<h3 id="i875">I.87.5</h3>
<p>See the publ. intro. for discussion of the contents of this verse.
It may not be too farfetched to note, in connection with pāda d, where the
Maruts acquire “their names worthy of worship” (nā́māni yajñíyāni), that in 1d they
were explicitly unidentified and undifferentiated (ké cid “whoever they are”). The
acquisition of these names follows their “reaching” (ā́śata) Indra, presumably to
render him moral support in the Vṛtra battle with their chants (ṛ́k-) (pāda c). In other
treatments of the aftermath of this battle they successfully negotiate with Indra for a
share in the soma sacrifice (see I.165, etc.), and the expression “acquired names
worthy of worship / sacrificial names” may be a way of expressing this incorporation
of them into the dedicands of the soma sacrifice. Note that in VI.48.21 the Maruts
assume Indra’s sacrificial name (dadhire nā́ma yajñíyam), also in connection with
the Vṛtra battle.</p>
<h3 id="i876">I.87.6</h3>
<p>It is odd that the Maruts, just called ṛ́kvan- themselves (5c), here join
themselves with ṛ́kvabhiḥ. Ge suggests either that they have an “Anhängerschaft” of
singers or have gone among singers themselves; Re that it’s an instrumental of
identification (“en tant que chantres”). Gr invents, for this passage alone, a meaning
‘Glanz, Strahl’ for ṛ́kvan-. Given the identification of the human poet with the
Maruts in the same capacity in vss. 4–5, the singers of 6b may be human singers,
although the other instrumental attributes in this verse do not fit this picture. Ge
points out that in the first verse of the next hymn, I.88.1b, the Maruts’ chariots are
svarká- ‘equipped with lovely chants’, and so the ṛ́kva- here might refer to their
chariots, which are conspicuously absent from the list in pādas a–c. This is the
explanation I currently prefer.
The word iṣmín- is glossed by Gr as ‘eilend, stürmend’ (followed by WG),
while Ge and Re take it as ‘possessing arrows’, deriving apparently from a
suggestion of Bloomfield (see EWA s.v.), a suggestion emphatically rejected by
161
Mayrhofer (loc. cit.). Certainly a derivation from íṣu- ‘arrow’ is, to say the least, not
without problems. But in two of its other three occurrences, iṣmín- is found in a
weapons context as it is here, and the derivation therefore seems worth attempting.
Starting from íṣu-, the -in- possessive would be *iṣvín-. It is possible that the normal
distribution of -vant- and -mant- possessives, with -mant- regularly built to stems in -
u- (paśu-mánt-, etc.), as opposed to -vant-, would make *iṣvín- beside íṣu- appear
anomalous, and it was “corrected” to iṣmín-. Note the regularly formed íṣumant- (2x).</p>

<h3 id="i883">I.88.3</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. tr., I take the so-far-unnamed poets (who appear as
the Gotamas in the next verse) as the subject of kṛṇavante. They are erecting their
thoughts like trees for the Maruts to chop down with the axes in pāda a. By contrast,
most tr. take the Maruts as subject of kṛṇavante (so explicitly Re, implicitly WG; Ge
hesitates between the Maruts and the poets).
The simile in pāda b causes some minor grammatical problems. The Pp reads
medhā́, but if this word belongs to medhā́- (fem.) ‘wise thought’, we should rather
read medhā́ḥ (so Ge, Gr.). This is of course possible in this sandhi context, but pādafinal ūrdhvā́is not amenable to such an analysis: it must be neuter plural and
therefore can’t modify a fem. medhā́ḥ. Gr sets up a neut. medhá- ‘Schaft’ for just this
passage, presumably to deal with the apparent gender disharmony. But it is simpler
to assume that ūrdhva- has been attracted into the neuter by the vánā in the simile (so
Old).
The epithet tuvidyumná- is otherwise only used of gods, save for IX.98.1,
where it modifies the wealth brought by Soma. The only other plural form (V.87.7)
modifies the Maruts, but the standard tr. assume that it here qualifies the priests,
because the Maruts appear in the dative in pāda c and should therefore not be the
subjects of the verb in the same clause. The difficulty disappears if we read c with b,
rather than d. I then take the Maruts to be the subject in d, with the epithet
appropriate to them, and also take the middle dhanayante as intransitive with an acc.
of goal, rather than transitive “set the (pressing) stone in motion” with other tr.</p>
<h3 id="i884">I.88.4</h3>
<p>For the imagery here, see the publ. intro.
The sequence páry ā́va ā́gur with doubled preverb is curious. Ge provides
numerous parallels in his n. 4a, but none like this, with the two preverbs separated
only by an enclitic pronoun and contained within a preverb (pári) – verb sequence. I
have no explanation for this, though I would note that of the 8 occurrences of
supposed aguḥ / águḥ, 7 are pāda-final and are univerbated with the preverb ā́, as
ā́guḥ.
The hapax vārkār
i
yā́m is of course very obscure. Ge simply takes it as an
unanalyzable name of the “Sangeskunst” of the Gotamas. However, it is clearly a
compound and the compound members are easily identified: vār- ‘water’ and √kṛ
‘make’, and so it should be susceptible to meaningful analysis. As indicated in the
publ. intro. I believe that it has the same underlying referent as anubhartrī́in 6a,
162
namely the musical instrument, in my view the vīṇā, and that the poet was playing
with the paradox that the instrument is grammatically feminine but in some forms
looks remarkably like male genitalia. I therefore follow Gr’s gloss ‘Wasser …
schaffend’ and assume that it refers to the penis. The problem is what kind of
formation it is, and how to get an agentive-like meaning out of kār
i
yā́-. First, note
that the formation does not have gerundive accent and is therefore not a conventional
sgerundive despite the vṛddhi in the root and the shape of the suffix. Formally it is
most likely a verbal abstract ‘water-making, Wasserbeschaffung’, as Old takes it (so
also AiG II.2.832 following Old). However, because it was a feminine abstract, I
think that it was secondarily available to be identified with the underlying feminine
referent, the vīṇā, and animatized as a quasi-agent.
Note the phonological play between vārkār- (b) and arkaír (c).</p>
<h3 id="i885">I.88.5</h3>
<p>All standard tr. take ná as negating the verb aceti. It seems unlikely to me that
an annunciatory aorist would be negated (“this very thing has not just been seen”),
and its clause-internal position, not immediately preceding the verb, also seems
unusual for such an interpretation. I take it instead as negating only the following
word yójanam and expressing the surprise that what has just appeared is very close,
not (even) a trek away.
I thus take yójana- as a measure of distance, as it generally is, rather than as
“Gespann,” with most tr. Rather than yójanam I take the referent of etát tyát to be the
formulation (bráhma) that the Gotamas made in the previous verse. This formulation,
also referred to as a dhī́- ‘insight’ in 4b, providentially appears at the same moment
as the Maruts approach. In what sense does the formulation “appear”? I interpret this
verb to mean that the poem that Gotama created in private (sasvár 5b) is now being
performed in public (i.e., at the ritual welcoming the Maruts). This interpretation also
entails supplying the verb “made” in 5b (echoing kṛṇvantaḥ in 4c), rather than “saw”
(with most tr., anticipating páśyan 5c).
My last departure from the standard tr. in this verse is in taking the acc. pl.
masculines in cd, híraṇyacakrān, áyodaṃṣṭrān … varā́hūn as comprising two
separate but conjoined NPs without overt conjunction (as so often), rather than one
single NP, since I find “golden-wheeled boars” an unlikely entity even in the RVic
universe of discourse. With ‘golden-wheeled’ in c it is natural to supply ‘chariots’;
the “copper-tusked boars” in d can easily be an extravagant characterization of the
Maruts.</p>
<h3 id="i886">I.88.6</h3>
<p>For detailed disc. of this verse, see my 1981 article, “A Vedic sexual pun:
ástobhayat, anubhartrī, and RV I.88.6,” Acta Orientalia 42 (1981[82]) 55-63. The
gist of the article is the interpretation of anubhartrī́, a feminine agent noun built to
ánu √bhṛ, a euphemistic idiom that refers to sexual penetration &ndash; e.g., in the cosmic
incest myth (X.61.5). The paradox of creating a feminine agent noun from this idiom
is the trick of the verse and echoes the use of vārkāryā́- in vs. 4 &ndash; both, in my view,
referring to the vīṇā, a feminine noun but a musical instrument with a
characteristically phallic shape. The hapax causative ástobhayat ‘cause to sound’
163
(beside the simplex stobhati in b) has as its implicit subject the (male) player of the
instrument and taps into the (probably universal) notion of a man playing a woman
like an instrument in sexual encounters, with the added fun of the gender reversal in
anubhartrī́. The instrument both sounds (práti ṣṭobhati, b) and is caused to sound
(ástobhayat, c), a reasonable dual view of what a musical instrument does. I take
vṛ́thā āsām, with its unidentified fem. gen. pl., as referring to all women, who, in
male fantasy anyway, all “want it” &ndash; conveyed by my somewhat loose tr. “the way
women like it.” Other tr. supply ‘songs’ or ‘chants’ with āsām, for which there is no
particular support.

<p>Ge (/WG) take the repeated tád’s of a-c (but not the one in d) as referring to
the mayobhú … bheṣajám “the remedy that is joy itself” and supply verbs in pāda bc
to support this object. Re by contrast takes the repeated tád as adverbial, ‘ainsi’. This
is more or less what I arrived at, though ascribing somewhat more meaning to the
adverbially used neuter pronoun. I assume it refers to the call embodied in the nivídof 3a (though nivíd- itself is fem.), which call is finally the suppressed object of tád
… śṛṇutam “listen to this” in d.</p>
<h3 id="i896">I.89.6</h3>
<p>The rigid parallel structure of the four pādas is resolved by the final word of
the verse dadhātu, which verb must be supplied for the first three pādas. This rigid
structure, svastí naḥ GOD EPITHET, also allows the metrical irregularity of the first
two pādas to be kept under strict control. Under HvN’s interpretation each of those
two pādas has a rest after the s
u
vastí naḥ opening, with the GOD EPITHET phrase taking
the rest of the line. Old suggests reading trisyllabic indi
ra, as often, as well as pū̂ṣā́,
with distracted ū. The former seems more likely than the latter, but because of the
parallelism of a and b in HvN’s reading, I prefer theirs.</p>
<h3 id="i897">I.89.7</h3>
<p>The identify of the mánavaḥ in c is not clear. I take it as a continuation of the
description of the Maruts, though it is the case that mánu- and its derivatives do not
otherwise characterize the Maruts. Ge (/WG) suggests that it refers to men who have
become gods or been assimilated to the gods, like the Ṛbhus, while Re thinks c
belongs with d and refers to the All Gods, though this explanation runs into the same
problem as the Marut identification.

<p>The publ. tr. takes ā́yuḥ as obj. of rīriṣata, but it may be better to take naḥ as
the obj. of that verb and construe ā́yuḥ with the inf. gántoḥ. Cf. Krick’s rendering
(316): “Schädigt (tötet) uns nich mittendrinnen, bevor wir die volle Lebensdauer
erreicht haben.” I would differ from Krick in taking gántoḥ as a gen. dependent on
madhyā́“Do not harm us in the middle of our going through our lifetime.” For

<p>Pāda b is a textbook example of gender attraction of the pronoun in

<p>It is unclear from Ge’s ‘aussuchen’ (/WG’s ‘auswählen’) whether they
attribute ví … cyantu to √ci ‘pile’ or √ci ‘observe’, since the proposed meaning

‘dégager’, also Re), I take it to the ‘pile’ root, with the literal sense being ‘pile
[obstructions, detritus, etc.] apart or away’, thus ‘clear’, of paths. This idiom is found
several times elsewhere of paths: IV.37.7, IV.55.4, VI.53.4 (passages collected also

<h3 id="i911">I.91.1</h3>
<p>The multiple possible meanings of the root(s) √cit and the unclear
morphological identity of (prá) cikitaḥ make the interpretation of the first pāda
somewhat difficult. I follow Thieme’s solution (Plusq.), adopted also by Kü (176-77),
that it is underlyingly a medial injunctive to the perfect stem (that is, an unaugmented
pluperfect), patterning with pf. cikité, etc. But the underspecification of this posited
*cikita caused it to be re-marked with an active ending (like root presents of the type
aduha-t). It should not be a subjunctive, despite its thematic appearance, because of
the zero-grade root syllable, and, pace WG, it should not be a trans./caus.
reduplicated aorist because of the light reduplicating syllable (expect *cīkitas) &ndash;
although I do have to admit that acikitat in VII.80.2 does seem to function like a
redupl. aorist. WG supply panthā́m, from b, as object in a, but this seems
unnecessary. On a potential ring made by prá cikitaḥ here and prá cikitsā in the last
pāda of the hymn (23d), see publ. intro.
165
The other question in pāda a is whose inspired thought is at issue. I assume
that it is ours (that is, the poets’), in that the priests and poets create the ritual that
makes soma manifest.</p>
<h3 id="i912">I.91.2</h3>
<p>This verse is structured by a series of etymological figures involving a nom.
sg. modifying soma and an instr. pl. specifying his qualities &ndash; a: krátubhiḥ sukrátuḥ,
b: dákṣaiḥ sudákṣaḥ, c: vṛ́ṣā vṛṣatvébhiḥ, d: dyumnébhir dyumnī́. It is a not a subtle
device, but effective. On the first hemistich see further ad vs. 14.</p>
<h3 id="i913">I.91.3</h3>
<p>Soma is here identified with the three principal Ādityas. This vs. is identical
to IX.88.8, though the two publ. tr. differ in pāda b. I would now alter the tr. here to
“yours is his lofty, deep domain, o Soma.” See disc. ad IX.88.8.
The (pseudo-)gerundive dakṣā́yya- has attracted a number of different
renderings &ndash; in this passage alone, Ge “zu Gunst geneigt,” Re “qu’on doit-servirefficacement,” WG “als Zufriedenzustellender.” I prefer to tie it more closely with
dákṣa- ‘skill’, as “whose skill is to be sought,” despite the awkwardness of the
English gloss. In this passage Soma was just credited with skill (2b) and will later
dispense it (7c; cf. also 14c), and in both I.129.2 and VII.97.8 the ability of Indra and
Bṛhaspati to bring about good things is emphasized. JPB in VII.1.2 prefers “to be
skillfully tended,” quite close to Re’s rendering above. This latter tr. would work for
Agni (II.4.3, VII.1.2), who requires ritual tending, but less well for Indra, Bṛhaspati,
and (here) Aryaman.</p>
<h3 id="i914">I.91.4</h3>
<p>The perennially difficult dhā́man-, found also in 3b, is a bit difficult to
interpret here as well. In both 3b and 4ab, the dhā́man- appear to be concrete and
locatable in space, for which the tr. ‘domain(s)’ fits well (cf. also WG “Stätten”). But
then in cd Soma is urged to accept our oblations with them, which seems difficult to
do with a place and edges closer to Ge’s “Formen,” a nebulous and all-purpose
rendering that I try to avoid with this word. Re’s “structures” doesn’t help either. I
must assume that “accept with all your (domains)” is a compressed way of saying
“wherever you are, accept.” The same problem is found, to some extent, in vs. 19.</p>
<h3 id="i916">I.91.6</h3>
<p>A good example of subordinating ca.
On the use of vánaspáti- ‘lord of the forest’ for soma, see comm. ad IX.12.7.
This usage is found only here and in IX.12.7. Because our phrase priyástotro
vánaspátiḥ is almost identical to IX.12.7 nítyastotro vánaspátiḥ, I am now inclined to
translate the bahuvr. ‘who has praise as his own’, not ‘to whom praise is dear’.</p>
<h3 id="i917">I.91.7</h3>
<p>As Ge and Re both point out, the dat. yū́ne ‘youth’ in b suggests that the
parallel mahé in a refers specifically to an adult.</p>
<h3 id="i9110">I.91.10</h3>
<p>I take the pf. part. jujuṣāṇáḥ as expressing an action anterior to that of the
main verb, impv. upā́gahi. If this is correct, the verse is constructed chiastically, with
166
imáṃ yajñám construed with upā́gahi, while the call that precedes Soma’s arrival at
the sacrifice is nested in between (idáṃ váco, jujuṣānáḥ).
I.91.11–12: The two alliterative root noun compounds vacovíd- (11b) and vasuvíd-
(12b) nonetheless contain the two synchronically separate roots, ‘know’ and ‘find’.</p>
<h3 id="i9114">I.91.14</h3>
<p>Although it is tempting to take dákṣa- as adjectival here (so Ge, WG), I am
somewhat dubious that this stem can be an adjective, and in any case the emphasis on
the skill associated with Soma in this hymn (vss. 2b, 3d, 7c) suggests a nominal
reading here. Although the pairing of an abstract quality (skill) with an animate being
(poet) might seem awkward, I see it as a variant reprise of 2ab, where krátu-
(‘intention’) and dákṣa- were paired; as discussed ad I.2.7–9, krátu- and dákṣa- are
two of the three qualities required to bring an action about and are regularly
associated. Here kaví- stands in for krátu-. This substitution is enabled by the
syntagm “the poet’s krátu-, as in the cmpd. kaví-kratu-. (Re’s interpr. is similar; see
his n.)</p>
<h3 id="i9119">I.91.19</h3>
<p>Here again, as in vs. 4, the dhā́māni of Soma are recipients of the oblation;
Ge’s Formen again works more smoothly, but I still consider these to be the locales
listed in 4ab, each of which can be a site of sacrifice.
Note the disharmony in number between the neut. pl. subj. (tā́viśvā) and the
sg. pred. nom. (paribhū́ḥ) and verb (astu). This could be an example of the inherited
construction of neuter pl. with a singular verb, but I think it’s more likely just a
constructio ad sensum, with “all these” summarizing the plural subjects of the rel. cl.
as if in a mass. English “all this” can be similarly used, after a listing of discrete
entities. The Sanskrit has just been more punctilious about maintaining number
agreement.
Ge, Re, WG all supply ‘lifetime’ as the implicit object of pratáraṇaḥ, rather
than my ‘us’; they are most likely correct, given how common the idiom ā́yus- prá
√tṝ is. I might change the publ. tr. to “lengthening (our lifetime).”</p>
<h3 id="i9120">I.91.20</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) takes the final phrase of d yó dádāśad asmai as expressing the
indirect object with dadāti in b (“gives [to him,] who …”), rather than as a
qualification of vīrám (or even of pitṛ-, as Re almost seems to). I think this is correct,
but it is mildly disturbing that there is no overt expression of the datival recipient in
the main clause; we would expect tásmai (see Ge’s n. 20d). It may have been gapped
because of the asmai in the rel. clause. Note that asmai cannot be a part of the main
clause and refer to the indirect object, the man who does pious service, because it is
unaccented; it must be part of the rel. cl. and refer to Soma.</p>
<h3 id="i9121">I.91.21</h3>
<p>This verse plays a minor syntactic trick. It consists of a string of acc. sg.
masc. qualifiers; since the previous vs. also consists largely of an acc. sg. masc. NP
headed by vīrám, the audience would be likely to assume that the new series of
grammatically matching adjectives are also qualifiers of vīrám, esp. since this type of
167
syntactic dependence between verses is not uncommon in the RV. It is only when we
arrive at the middle of the final pāda that we encounter tvā́m and discover that the
accusatives of this verse refer to Soma, not to the hero he gives us in 22.
Ge accounts for the curious hapax bhareṣu-jā́- ‘born at raids’ by the fact that
soma is especially offered before battle. This is probably correct, though the
semantics could be tighter. Scar essentially accepts this explanation and cites III.51.8
(of soma) jātám … mahé bhárāya, though he explores some other possibilities as
well.</p>
<h3 id="i9123">I.91.23</h3>
<p>In the phrase devéna … mánasā we again confront a noun (devá-) that seems
to be used adjectivally (see vs. 14 above). I have half given in to this temptation, with
“god(like).”
The verb ā́tanat in c poses some difficulties in interpretation. Surprisingly,
none of the standard tr. who discuss the phrase notes that the same lexeme (ā́√tan)
appears in the previous verse (22c) in the same metrical position and in a common,
almost clichéd́ usage. I think that ā́tanat here is a slangy expression, deliberately
constrasting with the high-style cosmic-description usage of ā́tatantha in 22. I take
the subject to be the wealth (or share of wealth) of b, rather than the mánas- of a, as
Ge (/WG) take it, nor would I following Re in taking it as an impersonal construction.
It is not entirely clear who the “both” are in d: Ge singers and patrons, Re
men and gods.
Ge supplies ‘path’ with prá cikitsā (“sei … der Pfadfinder”) on the basis of
IV.47.20. This is possible, and might even be supported by the panthā́m in vs. 1,
since prá cikitsā seems to form a slight ring with prá cikitaḥ in 1a. However, the verb
does not need an object, in my opinion; the desiderative here can express a general
intention to be alertly perceptive.</p>
<h2 id="i92-dawn">I.92 Dawn</h2>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., vss. 1–4 and 5–8 appear to be parallel hymns,
the first with multiple Dawns, the second with just one.</p>
<h3 id="i921">I.92.1</h3>
<p>In pāda a my tr. differs slightly from the standard ones. I suggest that the
dawns have transformed themselves into a beacon, while in the standard interpr. they
have created/manufactured a beacon for themselves.
In b following Proferes 2003 (JAOS 123, pp. 330-31), I suggest, on the basis
of the fuller expression in the parallel verse 5c, that their “beam” is being anointed
like the sacrificial post (sváru-) at a ritual.
In c the poet exploits the syntactic ambiguity of the middle participle
niṣkṛṇvāná-. In the frame he takes it as a reflexive, “presenting themselves,” but in
the simile it is transitive “presenting arms.” The middle voice is still justified,
however, because the weapons belong to the subjects of the participle.</p>
<h3 id="i923">I.92.3</h3>
<p>The standard tr. are in agreement that árcanti only means “they sing” here and
that the meaning ‘shine’ for this verb stem is dubious. This judgment seems short-
168
sighted and unresponsive to the poetics of this hymn, and even if ‘shine’ is not the
normal sense of árca-, the nominal derivatives like arcí(s)- ‘ray, flame’ (see arcís- in
5a) would allow a ‘shine’ sense under the proper circumstances. And these are the
proper circumstances. This verse-initial verb, following on two verses describing the
color, brightness, and beams of the dawns, would most naturally be interpreted with
a ‘shine’ sense. The simile that follows, involving women at work, would then cause
the audience to rethink this assumption, producing the interpretation ‘sing’, with the
women singing work songs at their labors. But ‘sing’ makes little sense for the frame
of the passage: do dawns ‘sing’? While ‘shine’ makes little sense for the simile: do
working women ‘shine’? As in 1c the poet uses the ambiguity of the verbal pivot to
craft two incompatible but verbally impeccable pictures, but this time he relies not on
syntactic ambiguity as in 1c but synonymity &ndash; a pun on the verbal root underlying
the verb form. The pun may be even cleverer than so far presented. Although the
primary sense of árcanti for the dawns should be ‘shine’, it is possible that there is a
secondary sense ‘sing’, in that birds begin to sing at dawn and the ritual recitation
also begins at that time. Similarly, although ‘sing’ should be the primary sense for
the women in the simile, they may also be said to shine if they are glistening with
sweat from their labors. (Recall the old expression “men sweat, but women ‘glow.’”)
It should be noted that Ludwig thought the verb was “doppelsinnig” (see Ge n. 3a).
In terms of the publ. tr. (and other standard tr.), the simile particle ná is late,
since the simile is assumed to start with nā́rīḥ. However, it is possible that nā́rīḥ
characterizes the Dawns, and the simile consists only of apáso ná viṣṭíbhiḥ. In that
case, the chanting workers could be men: an alt. tr. “The ladies chant [/shine] like
workers at their labors.”
Pace Gr and Lub, áha should be taken not as the particle, but as short neut. pl.
to áhar / áhan- ‘day’, with víśvā; cf. the well-attested expression áhā víśvā.</p>
<h3 id="i924">I.92.4</h3>
<p>bárjaha- in b is a hapax, but related to dual barjahyè in AV XI.8.14 in a list of
body parts, found between the ribs and the sides. Whitney/Lanman tr. ‘nipples’ there.
The consensus tr. ‘udder’ seems reasonable, esp. on the assumption that usrā́‘ruddy’
designates a cow. However, the purport of the simile is a little unclear. Since cows
don’t wear clothes, their udders are not covered to begin with and uncovering is
unnecessary. Ge suggests that the simile is proleptic: Dawn’s breast becomes as
visible as a cow’s full udder, but this interpretation requires that the verb
(‘uncovers’) that should mediate between frame and simile has been semantically
elided.
The simile in d is similarly “off,” since cows don’t have the capacity to open
their own pens. Macdonell (Hymns from the Rigveda, 1922) tr. “as when cows break
from their stalls,” which makes more sense, but again misrepresents the pivotal verb.
The apparently wrong sandhi āvar támaḥ is, as has long been known, an ex. of
degemination in context: āvar represents the older 3rd sg. root aor. *āvart. See Old,
Prol. 424 n. 1, AiG I.304–5, 336.
169</p>
<h3 id="i925">I.92.5</h3>
<p>As noted before, vs. 5 seems to match vs. 1 and begin a new hymn parallel to
vss. 1-4, but adapted for a single dawn, not the multiples in vs. 1. The return of the
words bhānú- ‘beam’ and √añj ‘anoint’ (1b) is particularly salient, as also √śri (2d),
√arc (3a), and péśas- (4a).
The poet produces yet another complication of simile structure in cd. The
Daughter of Heaven in d is clearly the subject of the clause, but the simile occupying
c has a participle in the masc. nom. sg., añján, which cannot modify the grammatical
subject. We must here supply a masculine ritual officiant, who is propping up and
anointing the sacrificial post, as Dawn props up and anoints her beam. (Note that
bhānúm served as object of both verbs in the earlier parts of the hymn: 1b bhānúm
añjate, 2d bhānúm … aśiśrayuḥ.) The two distinct objects in simile and frame are
mediated by the word péśas-, which is appropriate to both. Dawn has just donned her
own péśāṃsi in 4a, but péśas- can also be used of ritual paraphernalia &ndash; e.g., the
pressing stones, which are called adhvarásya péśaḥ at VII.42.1.</p>
<h3 id="i926">I.92.6</h3>
<p>vayúnā kṛṇoti reprises ákran … vayúnāni in 2c.
chándaḥ is somewhat problematic. Gr takes it as a masc. nom. sg. to a them.
adj. chánda-, with the developed sense “der Gefallende, Schmeichler oder Buhle,”
and this tack is followed by the standard tr. (incl. the publ. one). But the only other
supposed occurrence of this stem, in VIII.7.36, I take to the much better established
s-stem neut. chándas- ‘metrical vs.’. However, that solution is not available here, at
least as far as I can see, and so I reluctantly follow the standard solution, without
much faith in its correctness. It does not help this interpr. that Dawn is being
compared to a masc. being, esp. since smiling is almost always a feminine action.
Redupl. ajīgaḥ must be a transitive redupl. aor. beside jā̆rayati ‘causes to
awaken’. Cf. I.113.4-6: uṣā́ajīgar bhúvanāni víśvā. I supply ‘us’ as obj. here, on the
basis of the 1st pl. subj. in pāda a.</p>

<p>Note the etymological, though no longer semantic, relationship between
sūnṛ́tānām (a) and nṛvátaḥ (c).
I.92.7–8: Contra Gr, áśva-budhya- cannot mean ‘durch Rosse bemerkenswerth’ with
a gerundive to √budh, among other things because of the bahuvrīhi accent. Rather it
belongs with áśva-budhna- ‘having a foundation of horses’, by way of *-budhnya-,
an analysis that goes back to Aufrecht. All 3 occurrences of this stem (I.92.7–8,
121.14) qualify wealth or prizes. On the related hapax áśva-budhna- see comm. ad
X.8.3.</p>

<p>‘Forelock’ for pravarga- may seem slightly flippant, but I wanted to capture
the ‘twist’ sense of prá √vṛj, in contrast to the anodyne ‘having slaves at the front’
found in the other tr.
The final bṛhántam of d obviously refers back to the rayím so carefully
detailed in ab, but is separated from that phrase by a considerable amount of material.

Rather than making it a long-delayed part of that NP I have taken it as a pseudo-goal
with vibhā́si, with vā́ja-prasūtā giving grounds for that goal.
I.92.8–9: vibhā́si (8c) and ví bhāti (9b) should have been rendered with the same
English verb, either “radiate” or “shine.” I would now change the publ. tr., to ‘radiate’
in both cases.</p>
<h3 id="i929">I.92.9</h3>
<p>Unfortunately it is not possible to render the three fronted forms of víśva-
(pādas a, c, d) in non-awkward English.
cákṣuḥ in b can be either nom. or acc. Most tr. take it as the latter, with Dawn
facing either the eye(s) of, presumably, humans (so Ge [/WG], Re) or the eye of the
sun (so Macdonell [Hymns from the Rigveda], Maurer). The latter is unlikely on
pragmatic grounds: although the eye of the sun is a standard trope in the RV (see in
fact 11d), the sun rises after dawn, and Dawn surely wouldn’t be looking behind her,
to the east. The former is certainly possible, but I prefer to take cákṣuḥ as nominative,
referring to Dawn as an eye, since she has just been said to oversee (abhicákṣyā) all
creatures.
I’m not entirely sure what pāda d refers to, but perhaps it means that by
dawning she has stimulated ritual speech and therefore “finds” it.</p>
<h3 id="i9212">I.92.12</h3>
<p>This last verse of the trimeter portion of the hymn plays more tricks with
simile structure. In pāda a prathānā́functions like niṣkṛṇvānā́in 1c; that is, it has
both reflexive and transitive values. In the frame it is reflexive (“spreading herself”),
in my view, though Ge, Re, Macd., Maurer all supply “rays” as the object, on no
contextual grounds. (However, Ge does allow for the reflexive possibility in his
notes 12a, 1c.) In the simile paśū́n is the object; the assumed subject might be
“cowherd” or the like (so tentatively Re). But the simile is quite appropriate to Dawn
for two reasons: first, it is often said that livestock go out to pasture at dawn and
return to the fold at night; second, the rays of Dawn are often referred to as cows (see
in fact vs. 2 above), and though I don’t think the stem paśú- is so used, it inhabits the
same semantic space as the more usual terms that participate in this metaphor.
The second simile, síndhur ná kṣódaḥ in b, is taken by Ge, Re, Macd., Maurer
with the verb of b, vy àśvait. Because this verb ‘whitened’ is intransitive, this
requires either taking kṣódaḥ adverbially (Re “comme le fleuve (en son) remous”) or
construing síndhuḥ … kṣódaḥ as a loose compound (Ge “wie die Stromflot”).
Although either is possible, the syntactic difficulties disappear if the simile falls
within the verbal domain of prathānā́, “like a river spreading its surge.” Given this
poet’s particular delight in manipulating similes, it is entirely in character to end this
section of the hymn with a triple play.
WG interpret the similes more or less as I do.
Pāda c is structurally parallel with 11c, using the same verb mī ‘diminish,
belittle’, though here in the negative (11c praminatī́, 12c áminatī), both playing off
āminānā́in 10c. The relationship between 11c and 12c is particularly close, with the
171
human and the divine playing off each other: 11c praminatī́manuṣyā́yugā́ni, 12c
áminatī daívyāni vratā́ni.</p>
<h3 id="i9214">I.92.14</h3>
<p>The tr. “rich in … / richly…” implies that there is an etymological
connection between gomati, áśvāvati and revát, which of course there is not. But
“possessing cows and horses” seems too flat.</p>

<p>The hí + imperative followed by áthā + imperative is the same structure as

<p>√yā is the usual verb that governs vártis- (I.34.4, I.116.18, etc. etc.), and I
supply a form of it here.
The publ. tr. implies that sámanasā is a vocative, but, by its accent, it’s a
nominative and would better be tr. “as like-minded ones.”</p>
<h3 id="i9217">I.92.17</h3>
<p>Gautama’s penchant for clever exploitation of syntactic possibilties returns
in this verse, after a series of unremarkable Uṣṇih verses (13–16). The verb in b,
cakráthuḥ, by my interpretation takes two different types of predicates and exhibits
slightly different root meanings: in pāda a “make your call to heaven,” that is, make
the call reach heaven; in b “make, i.e., create, light.” I am in agreement with the
standard tr. of pāda b, but diverge from them in a, where Ge (/WG) supply a separate
verb (“erhebt”) to govern ślókam and interpret ā́diváḥ temporally (“zu dieser Stunde
des Tages”), not spatially. Although ā́diváḥ is sometimes used temporally (e.g., in
the expression trír ā́diváḥ), I take the ā́here in the meaning “all the way to” (Gr’s
“Praep. mit folgendem Abl. … bis an, bis hin (räumlich)”). This usage of ā́was
prepared for in the immediately preceding vs., 16a asmád ā́“all the way to us”
(though in opposite order). For a closely parallel expression, in a Dawn hymn, cf.
III.61.4 ā́ntād [i.e., ā́ántād] diváḥ &hellip; ā́prthivy ̥ ā́ḥ “all the way to the end of heaven
and of earth.” For the ślóka- reaching heaven, cf. I.83.6, 190.4, and for ślókam as
object of √kṛ, IV.53.3.
I.93 Agni and Soma</p>
<h3 id="i931">I.93.1</h3>
<p>The expression in d bhávatam … máyaḥ echoes the compound in the final
verse of the immediately preceding hymn mahobhúvā (I.92.18) &ndash; both dual, though
applying to different divine pairs, the Aśvins (I.92.18) and Agni and Soma (here). It
is possible that this final hymn of the Gautama sequence, with its unique dedication
to Agni and Soma (see publ. intro.), was attached just here because of the duplication
of phraseology. This connection would be clearer in the publ. tr. if they were tr. in
the same way. I would therefore change “become refreshment” to “become joy” in
this verse.</p>

<p>As noted in the publ. intro., Bṛsaya, with his very non-Indo-Aryan name, and
the destruction of his offspring are found elsewhere only in VI.61.3, a hymn devoted
to Sarasvatī. The theft of the provender (avasá-) from the niggard (paṇí-) is also
found in that hymn, in vs. 1. The connection between the two hymns to different
gods, found in different parts of the Saṃhitā, is not clear to me, but the strong
similarity of the passages at least that Bṛṣaya is a paṇí-.</p>
<h3 id="i935">I.93.5</h3>
<p>Pāda b contains an inverse vāyav indraś ca construction: agníś ca soma.</p>
<h3 id="i937">I.93.7</h3>
<p>The three imperatives in b, vītáṃ háryatam … juṣéthām, all belong to roots
that ordinarily take accusatives, yet all must be construed with the fronted gen.
havíṣaḥ prásthitasya in pāda a. I don’t quite understand the case syntax, but assume
that these three verbs have been lumped together generically as verbs of consumption
and enjoyment, for which gen. complements are often possible.
In c bhūtám can be either imperative or injunctive and is taken as injunctive in
the published translation (as also by Ge and Re). However, since the immediately
preceding hymn (I.92.15) contains the clausal diptych hí + imperative, followed by
áthā + imperative, exactly matching the structure here, I now think it would be better
to interpret bhūtám as impv. here as well: “Become providers …, then establish …”
(So WG.) An imperative interpretation also works better with the three abrupt
imperatives that precede in b. For further disc. see comm. ad VII.99.3.</p>
<h3 id="i938">I.93.8</h3>
<p>saparyā́t in b echoes saparyáti in 2b, but displays the more usual case frame:
acc. (god) + instr. (means of service). The instance in 2b takes acc. (means of
service) + dat. (god), which is only otherwise found at X.37.1. The occurrence in this
verse thus functions as a species of poetic repair.</p>
<h3 id="i939">I.93.9</h3>
<p>The purport of the final pāda isn’t clear to me, but it may indirectly comment
on the unusual nature of the joint dedication of the hymn to these two gods.</p>
<h3 id="i9310">I.93.10</h3>
<p>dā́śati echoes dā́śāt in 3b.
I.93.10–11: 2nd du. dīdayatam (10c) and jujoṣatam (11b) are somewhat problematic
forms. They belong to redupl. thematic stems; other forms to these stems are
subjunctives to the perfect. However, they have secondary endings, and the act. 2nd
and 3rd du. subjunctive endings should be primary. Lub identifies them as impvs. (Gr
also jujoṣatam); Kü (35) treats them as “hybrids” &ndash; morphologically belonging to the
subjunctive but functioning as imperatives. They differ from some other secondarily
thematized pf. impvs. in having full grade of the root syllable, like the subjunctive
(versus zero-graade in pīpyatam √pi, √vāvrdhásva √vṛdh, etc. &ndash; but cf. pipráyasva
√prī). In the publ. tr. they are treated as subjunctives (“you will shine,” “you will
enjoy”), but they would might be better rendered as imperatives. For further disc. of
such forms, see my forthcoming article on the perfect imperative.

<p>BR corrected sám mahema to sám ahema ‘we would bind together’ to √nah,
an emendation accepted by Gr, Ge, Old (tentatively), KEWA I.153. Although I also
accepted it in Jamison 1983: 87, I now follow Gotō (1987: 243; accepted in EWA
s.v.) in seeing it as a form of √mah ‘bring about’, etymologically separate from
√mah ‘magnify’. Although I do not like multiplying entities, Gotō’s etymological
connections look reasonable; an interpretation with ‘make great’ is difficult; and a
thematic pres. or aor. stem aha- to √nah does not exist and the zero-grade (&lt;*nh̥ )
that would have to underlie it is not otherwise found to √nah.</p>
<h3 id="i942">I.94.2</h3>
<p>yásmai √yaj presents the classic parasmaipada configuration: “sacrifice for
someone else,” but āyájase is resolutely middle. I do not have a good explanation for
this beyond the fact that the functional distinction between act. yájati and mid. yájate
is not well developed in the RV, esp. with preverb ā́, and also that Agni, the subject,
is essentially sacrificing to himself.
Although act. sā́dhati can be transitive (and WG so tr. it), it also has
intransitive/absolute uses (cf. the same tag in VI.70.3). Moreover, in this hymn
sādháyati (3a, 4c) serves as the transitive counterpart; the poet seems to have
constructed an -ati /-áyati Grundverb/Kaus. relationship.</p>
<h3 id="i943">I.94.3</h3>
<p>A choppy series of clauses, five in the first three pādas, with only the last
dependent in any way on another.</p>
<h3 id="i945">I.94.5</h3>
<p>gopā́(ḥ) in pāda a can be either sg. or pl. All the standard tr. take it as the
former, referring to Agni, but this makes grammatical difficulties. Ge interprets the
following asya as a word-haplology for *asy *asyá, thereby getting the 2nd sg. copula
but gratuitously accenting the pronoun. Old reads *asy for asya and suggests
accenting *cáranti. Re takes viśā́ṃ gopā́(ḥ) as a 3rd sg. expression (“Agni est …”) and
seems to leave the following text alone. But all such tr. must introduce an accent on
whatever word they think follows the short initial clause, since, as it stands, two
unaccented words, asya caranti, would open that clause. These difficulties can be
avoided by interpreting gopā́ḥ as plural, subject of caranti and coreferential with
jantávaḥ. Pl. gopā́- is elsewhere used of Agni’s sidekicks, presumably his flames, in
VI.8.7. Though it is true that this same expression viśā́ṃ gopā́(ḥ) is found two hymns
later (I.96.4) as an undoubted singular referring to Agni, the grammatical
complications resulting from taking it as a singular here outweigh that argument for
me.
Most tr. take the two-footed and four-footed as appositional to jantávaḥ and
therefore as those who roam by night. This is contrary to the usual RVic vision of the
creatures settling down at night. Agni’s flames make more sense as the roamers,
evoking the flickering firelight that provides nightly illumination. The flames are
called “herdsmen” because people and animals gather around the fire then, like a
flock. This interpretation does raise the question of how to construe the nom. case of
174
that expression dvipác ca yád utá cátuṣpat. I take it as a definitional relative clause
expanding on viśā́m (so also Old). The ca … utá is a mix of two “both … and”
constructions: X ca Y ca and utá X utá Y, with the first half of the conjoined NP
fronted around the subordinating yád. This construction is very similar to 9b dūré vā
yé ánti vā ké cid, complete with the fronted first element.
The etymological relationship between citráḥ and praketáḥ in c is not easily
rendered in English.</p>
<h3 id="i9410">I.94.10</h3>
<p>All standard tr. take b vṛṣabhásyeva te rávaḥ as the main cl. to the yád cl.
beginning in a, while I take it as a part of that yád cl. There is no way to tell, since
the second cl. lacks a verb whose accent or lack thereof would settle the matter.
There are also no semantic implications; I weakly prefer mine because of the fairly
emphatic ā́d ‘then, just after that’ beginning the second hemistich.
All tr. take vanínaḥ as ‘trees’ (lit. ‘possessing wood’). This is doubtless the
primary sense here, since this sequence of vss. describes a forest fire, but ‘winners’ is
also possible, since the metaphorical context is that of a chariot race; see esp. 10a,
11c.</p>
<h3 id="i9411">I.94.11</h3>
<p>I supply ‘makes’ on the basis of 9c sugáṃ kṛdhi, though strictly speaking
“that is an easy way” is perfectly acceptable.
tāvaká-, the vṛddhi derivative of the genitive of the 2nd ps. pronoun, enlarged
with -ka-, is a striking form, though exactly what special effect it is aiming at is
unclear. For the use of -ka- in pronominal derivatives, see Jamison 2009 (IIJ 52). As
discussed there, the -ka- tends to signal a lower register or slangy tone.</p>
<h3 id="i9412">I.94.12</h3>
<p>Most tr. take Mitra and Varuṇa as the objects of dhā́yase: approx. “Agni is
for the suckling of Mitra and Varuṇa.” But Agni is the one more likely in need of
suckling (that is, feeding the fire); cf., e.g., II.5.7. In particular, in the next hymn,
I.95.1, Agni is the object of the transitive/causative dhāpayete. I therefore take the
gen. mitrásya váruṇasya as dependent on héḷaḥ in b, parallel to marútāṃ. héḷa(s)- is
characteristic of Varuṇa (cf. I.24.14, VII.84.2; in VII.62.4 Mitra is included).
avayātā́m is the problem in the second pāda. Most tr. take it as a 3rd sg.
imperative (e.g., Re “qu’il exorcise”), but if so, it must be a middle root pres.
imperative, and there are no middle forms to this root √yā (as opposed to √yā
‘implore’). There is also the problem that the form should not be accented on the
stem but on the preverb (*áva yātām; see Ge n. 12b). Lub appears to take it as a gen.
pl. of the act. part. to the root pres., but in the absence of a tr. it is hard to know how
he would interpret it in context. Best to follow Old (who follows BR) in emending to
*avayātā́, the nom. sg. agent noun. Re is tempted by this reading, save for the fact
that with the acc. complement héḷaḥ we should expect the accent ávayātā. However,
the “rule” about the case of complements to agent nouns is broken so often that this
objection is not cogent. The final -m could have been acquired from the following
marútām (so Old), and since √yā ‘drive’ is a characteristic Marut verb and a genuine
175
example of the gen. pl. part. yātā́m is used of the Maruts in the refrain V.55.1–9, it
may have been rhetorically natural to transform the agent noun into this participle.</p>
<h3 id="i9413">I.94.13</h3>
<p>Both a and b turn on interpreting one word as both an appellative and a
proper name: mitráḥ in a, vásuḥ in b, though they occupy different places in the
parallel structures.
I.94.15–16: The meter here changes to Triṣṭubh, and the intra-hymnic refrain is
dropped. The 2nd hemistich of vs. 16 contains the first example in the Saṃhitā of the
Kutsa refrain.</p>
<h3 id="i9415">I.94.15</h3>
<p>Contra standard tr., I do not take anāgástvam as the obj. of dádāśaḥ, since
√dāś seldom takes an object that is not a god, and when it does, it is a ritual offering.
Instead I take it as belonging to a parallel nominal clause, still in the domain of
yásmai.
The final phrase that is the ostensible main clause, té syāma “might we be
they,” violates number agreement: pl. té cannot properly pick up sg. yásmai. This is a
variant of a common tag and feels tacked on.</p>
<h3 id="i9416">I.94.16</h3>
<p>Because sá with 2nd ps. reference is restricted by rule to imperatives (see
Jamison 1992 [HS 105]), ab must be a single clause, pace Ge.</p>
<h2 id="i95-agni">I.95 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="i951">I.95.1</h3>
<p>Ge suggests that the sun is referred to in c, Agni in d. But it seems more likely
that Agni is the referent of both (or at least the first referent: since Agni = Sun is a
common identification, there may be secondary association), and the point is simply
that fire looks different in the daylight from at night.</p>
<h3 id="i953">I.95.3</h3>
<p>The riddles in this verse have given rise to much more speculation than can be
covered here. In the first hemistich the major question is whether the three births of
pāda a (trī́ṇi jā́nā) are matched by three birth locations in b or only two. That there
are three locatives (samudré … diví … apsú) might support the first view; that there
are only two ékam’s the second. Despite their polarized positions in the pāda, I
believe that samudré … apsú refer to one place of birth, diví to another. X.45.3,
where samudré … apsú is one place of kindling (pāda a), diváḥ … ū́dhan a second
(b), and a third is referred to in cd, supports the two-locale view. This then allows the
third birth to be the ritual kindling described in the first vss. of the hymn, while very
tentatively we might identify the birth in waters as that of Apāṃ Napāt and that in
heaven as that of the sun. The three births can also refer to the three ritual fires, and
that notion is taken up obliquely in the second half of the verse, in my opinion.
The second hemistich describes the carrying of the kindled fire to the east end
of the ritual ground, to become the Āhavanīya fire (not so called in the RV, but
clearly referred to often in the text). This pacing out of the ritual ground also
176
establishes the other ordered elements in the ritual, hence the VPs of pāda d. Gr and
Old both read *pradíśam for prá díśam, as also in IV.29.3. I am not certain that that
change is necessary here, though interrupting the pū́rvam ánu … díśam phrase with
the preverb is somewhat disturbing (though note that prá immediately follows the
caesura).</p>
<h3 id="i954">I.95.4</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. describes the kindling of the fire in
typically enigmatic fashion, with multiple referents possible for each entity. (See the
various tr. and comm. for disc.) It also contains in pāda b a version of the beloved
paradox in which the child gives birth to his parents, though in this particular case I
am uncertain what exactly is meant. The janayata in 4b picks up the janayanta in 2a,
but with the subject and object reversed: in 2a the ten (fingers) begat the infant (fire);
here the calf (fire) begets his mothers. Note that, while janayanta in 2a is a standard,
formal -anta replacement (see my “Voice fluctuation in the Rig Veda: Medial 3rd
plural -anta in active paradigms,” IIJ 21 ([1979] 146–69), janayata here seems to be
a real middle: the mothers Agni begets are his own. For further disc., see comm. on
the near-identical expression in IX.95.1.On the basis of the echoing of 2a, I assume
that the mothers here are the fingers, though waters are also a popular suggestion &ndash;
one that does not fit the ritual context, in my opinion. The hard-working women in c
are probably also the fingers, though kindling sticks are also possible, esp. on the
basis of 5b.
svadhā́(-van)- is a signature word of this part of the hymn: 1c, 4b, 4d.</p>
<h3 id="i955">I.95.5</h3>
<p>The hymn began with unnamed dual feminines attending to the young fire;
this verse also contains unnamed dual feminines in the same role. But the identities
of the two pairs are different: Night and Dawn in 1, the world-halves in 5cd, 6a.
Note the word play of pratīcī́… práti, with slightly different meanings.
I.95.5–6: The caus. (práti) joṣayete in 5d, 6a literally means “they two cause (him) to
take pleasure (in themselves),” but this tr. seems too heavy, esp. in adjacent pādas.</p>
<h3 id="i956">I.95.6</h3>
<p>The position of simile-marking ná is aberrant, preceding the simile’s noun
méne and following the verb. Since the full simile is bhadré … ná méne, it seems that
this syntagm was distracted in some fashion, with the verb placed in its middle. On
méne see I.62.7.
The etymological figure in c, dákṣāṇāṃ dákṣapatiḥ “skill-lord of skills,” then
participates in a phonological figure with semantically distinct dakṣiṇatáḥ “from the
right (/south)” in d.</p>
<h3 id="i957">I.95.7</h3>
<p>I take the first half-verse as a description of fire both sending its flames
upwards and stretching out horizontally. Most tr. interpret yatate in b as transitive
(e.g., Ge “er eifert beide Heeresreihen an”), but the medial forms of this pres. stem
are intransitive or reflexive. I instead take ubhé sícau as an acc. of extent and assume
that it refers to the seams between the two world-halves found in vss. 5–6. With these
177
two halves, heaven and earth, meeting at the horizon, as it were, the seams between
them would stretch horizontally.
The “new clothes” he leaves for his mothers in d are probably the ashes that
fall on the kindling wood as he burns it.</p>
<h3 id="i958">I.95.8</h3>
<p>The first three pādas of this verse sounds very somian: the cows [=milk] and
the waters of b are the standard ritual substances mixed with soma in the IXth
Maṇḍala; the beginning of a, tveṣáṃ rūpáṃ kṛṇute, is also found in a soma hymn,
IX.71.8; and √mṛj ‘wipe, groom’ in c is a signature soma verb. This may be an
example of the covert equation of the two ritual gods, Agni and Soma. Pāda a is
easily interpreted in an Agni context; b makes more difficulties: the cows can here be
the ghee poured into the fire (which could cause the creation of an “even higher”
form in a), but the waters would obviously have a diminishing effect on the fire if it
actually “mingles” with them. Ge (n. 8b) suggests that the vedi is being sprinkled
with water, but that’s not what the text says. I think better to assume that this is an
incompletely adapted somian description.
Pāda c has caused interpretational difficulties, in particular because of the
apparent equation of the poet (kavíḥ) and the insight (dhī́ḥ), both nominative and both
apparent subjects of marmṛjyate. Ge takes them as conjoined nouns with suppressed
conjunction, “the poet (and) his thought,” which are both tending to the Unterlage of
Agni. This is not a bad solution, but it assumes that the kaví- is the human poet. Since
Agni was identified as a “great poet” (mahā́n kavíḥ) in 4d, it’s desirable to maintain
this identification if at all possible. Another solution is to take dhī́ḥ as a separate
nominal clause, as Re does (“il est la Vision-poétique”). He takes the referent of both
kavíḥ and dhī́ḥ to be Agni. WG seem to take dhī́ḥ as the object of the verb, though
without comment. This is presumably inspired by the fact that acc. pl. dhiyáḥ does
elsewhere serve as object to marmṛjyáte (IX.47.4). However, making dhī́ḥ into an acc.
pl. is grammatically difficult (though, I suppose, not impossible).
My solution involves reading the intensive marmṛjyate simultaneously in two
syntactically different ways, both of which are paralleled elsewhere in the RV. The
stem marmṛjyáte is one of the new-style -yáte intensives, which have medial
inflection and passive accent even if they have active semantics and pattern with
active stems in their averbo. See, for example, IX.47.4 just cited. (On this type and
its origin, see Jamison 1983 [MSS 42: 41–73].) Thus, the poet can be stroking the
budhnám in this transitive interpretation, like the many active forms of this root
including the act. athem. intensive mármṛj-. But several instances of medial
marmṛjyá- have the passive value the morphology implies (e.g., IX.62.13
marmṛjyámāna āyúbhiḥ, of soma), and I take dhī́ḥ as the subject of the verb read this
time as a passive. This syntactic pun might be clearer in the publ. tr. if the same word
had been used for both readings; better might be “… keeps stroking … is being
stroked,” though ‘groom’ is actually better with the insight as subject.

<h3 id="i959">I.95.9</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) assume that pāda a treats the Paryagnikaraṇa or the ritual act of
circling around an object with a firebrand, but jráyaḥ ‘expanse, expansion’ seems to
me rather to depict the horizontal spread of the fire out from its original kindling
place.</p>
<h3 id="i9510">I.95.10</h3>
<p>In pāda a srótaḥ can be either nominative, as appositive to the underlying
subject Agni, or accusative, an object parallel to gātúm ūrmím. I chose the second
alternative, contra Ge / Re, but either is possible and the meaning is virtually
identical.</p>
<h3 id="i9511">I.95.11</h3>
<p>revát in b may be either adverbial (as I’ve taken it) or the object, with

either is possible and the effect is essentially the same.</p>
<h2 id="i96-agni">I.96 Agni</h2>
<p>The first verses of this hymn connect Agni with the semi-divine ancestors and
culture heroes of the Ārya: Āyu, Manu, Vivasvant (vs. 2), Bharata (vs. 3),
Mātariśvan (vs. 4).</p>
<h3 id="i961">I.96.1</h3>
<p>Most tr. interpret mitrám … sādhan as “they conclude an alliance” (so Re; Ge
“Freundschaft”), but since mitrá- is so often a descriptor of Agni as the go-between
between gods and men, I assume that Agni is the referent here as well. So also Old
SBE.</p>
<h3 id="i962">I.96.2</h3>
<p>This verse attributes primal creative power to Agni first in the ritual realm
(ab), then in the cosmic realm (c). Ge (/WG) supply a different verb in c
(“bescheint”), presumably because Agni is not usually credited with cosmogonic
powers. But there is no contextual support for a new verb here, and in parallel
clauses containing only one verb the default interpretation is to supply the same verb
with the second clause. Given how much generative power is ascribed to the Vedic
sacrifice, it is not surprising that Agni’s ability to engender Manu’s people, that is,
those who sacrifice like Manu, can then be extended to his ability to beget the major
cosmic features &ndash; esp. as in this enterprise he is partially identified with the sun.
Note that in 4c he is explicitly named as “the begetter of the two worlds” (janitā́
ródasyoḥ) as well as “the finder of the sun” (svarvíd).</p>
<h3 id="i963">I.96.3</h3>
<p>On the Bharata fire as “the focus of worship of multiple ārya clans,” see
Proferes 2007: 37.
Though sṛprá- receives various tr., it must be related to sarpís- ‘melted
butter’. See EWA s.v. sarpíṣ-; it has nothing to do with √sṛp ‘creep’.</p>
<h3 id="i964">I.96.4</h3>
<p>Contrary to the standard tr., I take pāda a as containing a separate predication:
in his capacity as Mātariśvan he ensures prosperity, while as Sun-finder he finds the
way.
179</p>
<h3 id="i967">I.96.7</h3>
<p>The full integration of the refrain into the syntactic structure of the verse is
signalled by the shift from nominative reference to Agni to accusative, clear first in
kṣā́m in b, since sádanam in a is neuter and could be in either case &ndash; the common use
of a morphologically ambiguous form as pivot.</p>
<h3 id="i968">I.96.8</h3>
<p>With the refrain having finally been integrated into the verse in 7, it is
abruptly dropped and its final and most salient word, draviṇodā́- explodes in vs. 8.
Though sánara- is a hapax, ‘having superior men’ seems a fairly safe bet, esp.
given semantically parallel vīrávant- in the next pāda. We might of course prefer
*sā́nara- given the init. laryngeal of the ‘man’ word, but in a nonce creation the
phonological history of the 2nd member would no longer be available.</p>
<h2 id="i97-agni">I.97 Agni</h2>
<p>The grammatically incomplete refrain of this hymn (ápa naḥ śóśucad aghám
“blazing away the bad for us”) is introduced first as the first pāda of this hymn and
then repeated as 1c. In that verse, the refrain’s participial construction is integrated
into the verse structure, modifying the subject of the main verb śuśugdhi in b. This
integration is not found again until vs. 6 and continues thereafter till the end of the
hymn (vss. 7–8). However, the semantic distance between the verse proper and the
refrain narrows as the hymn progresses. In vss. 2-3 there is no explicit mention of
Agni, but in vss. 4–5 he appears, as enclitic pronoun + voc. (te agne) in 4 and gen.
(agnéḥ) in 5, though neither is in the appropriate case to match the refrain.</p>
<h3 id="i971">I.97.1</h3>
<p>It does not seem worthwhile to try to replicate the difference between the two
reduplicated forms, the intensive participle (śośucat) and the perfect imperative
(śuśugdhi) in tr. — Re’s tr. of the inten. part., “écartant-par-ton-éclat-puissant,” is a
cautionary example of why. WG’s “immer wieder wegflammend” is somewhat less
clunky but still gets wearisome in repetition.
I.97.3–5: These three middle verses, before the refrain becomes reintegrated into the
verse, begin identically: prá yát, though the sense of yád in 3–4 differs from that in 5.</p>
<h3 id="i973">I.97.3</h3>
<p>The referent of bhándiṣṭha eṣām “the most fortunate one of these” is not clear.
However, since he is conjoined with “our patrons” and patrons are often conjoined
with “us” (as in the next verse), referring to the poet-performers (explicitly II.2.12
stotā́raḥ … sūráyaś ca), it is likely a singer or poet, perhaps even this very poet,
referring to himself in the 3rd ps.</p>
<h2 id="i98-agni">I.98 Agni</h2>
<h3 id="i982">I.98.2</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., I take this verse as an allusion to the well-known
story of Agni’s disappearance and the gods’ search for him (treated in detail in X.51–
53). (So also Old SBE.) However, this mythic allusion must be mediated by
180
reference to the here-and-now, given the hope for Agni’s protection expressed in the
final pāda. This mediation is perhaps signaled by pāda b, where Agni’s hiding place
is identified. Instead of the waters, where Agni takes refuge in the myth, he has
entered “all plants” (víśvā óṣadhīḥ). Agni’s hidden presence in plants, the quality that
allows him to be born from them, is a standard trope in hymns treating the kindling
of the ritual fire and is in fact alluded to at the end of a nearby Kutsa hymn, I.95.10d
antár návāsu carati prasū́ṣu “he roams within the new, fruitful (plants).”</p>
<h2 id="i99-agni">I.99 Agni</h2>
<p>The only single-verse hymn in the RV, it closes Kutsa’s Agni cycle. Though
attributed to Kaśyapa Mārīca by the Anukramaṇī, it shows clear connections with
other parts of Kutsa’s Agni hymns, for which see publ. intro.</p>

<p>In c, the presumed main clause to the relative clauses of ab, I have supplied a
verb of motion (“should come”), but it might be better, with Ge and Re, simply to
take c as the anticipatory qualifier of the subject (índraḥ) of the refrain in d.
The svébhiḥ of c is positioned between two other masc. pl. instr. and could
perhaps be taken with both, though I have tr. it only with évaiḥ because svébhir évaiḥ
appears to be a fixed expression: I.62.8, VIII.8.13, VIII.97.3, X.67.11.</p>
<h3 id="i1003">I.100.3</h3>
<p>Pāda a with its simile is interpreted variously, with the differences primarily
dependent on the construal of the participle dúghānāḥ. On the basis of III.31.10
páyaḥ pratnásya rétaso dúghānāḥ “milking out the milk of their age-old semen,” I
take the participle to be transitive and supply as object acc. páyaḥ, on which gen.
rétasaḥ is dependent. Since these are the only two occurrences of the stem dúghāna-
(as opposed to dúhāna-, etc.) and they share the word rétas-, it seems best to
interpret them in the same way. Ge, however, though adducing III.31.10, takes
dúghānāḥ as passive, “wie die gemolkenen (Ströme) des Himmelssamens” (sim. Re).
Both Ge and Re also take diváḥ as dependent on rétasaḥ, while I take it as parallel to
yásya, both dependent on pánthāsaḥ. The parallel expression in vs. 2 yásya …
sū́ryasyeva yā́maḥ “whose course, like that of the sun…” favors my interpr. of diváḥ,
though the passages adduced by Ge. (V.17.3, IX.74.1) do show that diváḥ can also
qualify rétas-.
Determining the syntactic structure here requires figuring out what image in
being depicted. We can begin with the gender paradox that figures prominently in
any interpretation: the milk(ing) and the semen. I do not think this can be separated
from Indra’s “male powers” (paúmsyebhiḥ) in c, and therefore think, contra most
other interpr., that it is Indra’s “paths” that are producing the semen-as-milk. Most
interpr. avoid this difficult image by taking dúghānāḥ entirely as part of the simile
(the milked-out [streams]), with the property shared by the frame (Indra’s paths) and
the simile only the anodyne verb yánti ‘go’. I freely admit that the image produced
by my interpr. is, to say the least, not straightforward, but it can be made intelligible
and it produces a richer semantics than the alternatives. In vss. 2 and 3 the trajectory
of Indra’s journeys is depicted as cosmic: his “course” (yā́maḥ) in 2 is like that of the
sun, his “paths” (páthāsaḥ) like those of heaven in 3. (See also his ‘routes’ in 4c.) I
therefore see these journeys as visually inscribed in the sky, almost like contrails
(however anachronistic that image is for the Vedic period). The cosmic equivalent of
these paths of Indras are likely the clouds, which produce rain. Now the refrain of
this hymn emphasizes Indra’s connection with the Maruts, and the Maruts are,
among other things, the gods associated with the thunderstorm and the monsoon and
are closely associated with the production of rain. So, Indra’s journey across the sky
with the Maruts can also be seen as producing rain, figuratively called semen
because of the Indra’s intensely male character. His “paths” on this journey are
compared to the clouds, whose visual “paths” as they move across the sky are deeply
familiar and which are the quintessential producers of rain.</p>
<h3 id="i1004">I.100.4</h3>
<p>In b sán is one of the (fairly few) examples of the nominative of the pres.
part. to √as that is not concessive (“although being &hellip;”). The phrase sákhibhiḥ sákhā
sán is, as Ge points out (n. 4b), structurally identical to I.76.5 kavíbhiḥ kavíḥ sán,
where the sán also lacks concessive force.
I.100.4–5: The pattern of instrumentals set in vs. 4 &ndash; “X with the X-es,” that is, “X
among the X-es” &ndash; appears to continue in 5a and c, but the instrumentals there are
used differently.</p>
<h3 id="i1005">I.100.5</h3>
<p>The participial phrase śravasyā̀ni tū́rvan has a close parallel in VIII.74.10c
yásya śrávāṃsi tū́rvatha. I translate the latter as “whose claims to fame you bring to
triumph.” Given the similarities I would change the tr. here to “along with the nestmates bringing to triumph (deeds) worthy of fame.”</p>
<h3 id="i1006">I.100.6</h3>
<p>The general opinion is that samádana- is simply an extension of samád-
‘battle’; Mayrhofer (EWA s.v. samád-) suggests that it’s a blend of samád- and
samáraṇa- ‘clash, battle’. I consider it rather a blend (with suffixal extension) of
samád- and máda- ‘exhilaration, elation’, hence ‘battle-elation’ or, in Re’s felicitous
tr. ‘l&rsquo;ivresse-du-combat’. In a nicely balanced expression, just as Indra reduces the
battle-fury of the enemy (manyu-mī́ḥ) he raises the battle-elation of those fighting
with him. This notion is continued in the next verse, where in pāda a the Maruts
cause Indra to enjoy the battle.
Ge and Re tr. sanat as a modal here (but not the repeated examples in vs. 18).
The form of course cannot be a subjunctive, given the augmented thematic forms that
belong to this paradigm (ásanat, etc.), and though injunctives can sometimes be
modal, there is no contextual reason for such an interpretation.</p>
<h3 id="i1007">I.100.7</h3>
<p>The abstract ūtí- ‘help’ is here personified, representing the Maruts. Cf.</p>
<h3 id="i529-1">I.52.9</h3>
<p>where the identification of ūtáyaḥ and marútaḥ is explicit.
karúṇa- is found only here in the RV; neither here nor in its very few other
occurrences in early Vedic (AV 1x, TS 1x) does it exhibit any semantic kinship with
later karuṇa- ‘pitiful’, karuṇā ‘pity’, though Mayrhofer (EWA s.v.) makes a valiant
effort to connect the meanings.</p>
<h3 id="i1008">I.100.8</h3>
<p>The apparent 3rd pl. med. verb apsanta is difficult. Ge simply refuses to
translate. Old suggests a connection with √sap but without conviction. Re and WG
(though both without disc.) must take it as a desiderative to √āp ‘reach, obtain’ (“…
cherchent à gagner,” “… wollen … erreichen”). But, though the standard desid. to
this root, ī́psati, is not attested until the AV, the lack of reduplication and the short
root vowel make the stem apsa- an unlikely desid. (This analysis is also rejected by
Ge in n. 8a.) I tentatively suggest that it belongs to the putative root √bhas ‘breathe’,
which Thieme (Gramm. Kat. 539) suggests underlies the various compounds in -psu-,
as well as Grk. ψυχή (see EWA s.vv. psu- and bhas2
) and that it means ‘inspire’. It
would then be the imperfect of a root pres. (or possibly a root aor.). Though we
might expect a weak form of the middle ending, *apsata, this may well be an -anta
replacement for act. -an of the type identified and described in Jamison 1979 (IIJ 21).
Old rejects a derivation from √bhas, but presumably referring to the other √bhas
‘bite’.</p>
<h3 id="i1009">I.100.9</h3>
<p>The standard tr., also Old and Tichy (1995: 42), take sáṃgṛbhītā as the nom.
sg. of an agentive -tar- stem, parallel to sánitā in pāda c, a form that should have fullgrade in the root syllable, *sáṃgrabhītā. I see no reason to reject the past participle it
appears to be, in order to assume a wrongly formed alternative. Although RVic poets
often make use of morphological parallelism, it is not a compositional requirement;
in fact, they often take pleasure in expressing semantically parallel notions in
morphologically dissimilar garb (see a nice example in 6a above, not to mention instr.
savyéna, loc. dakṣiṇé in this same hemistich). The verb yamati of pāda a can easily be
read with b as well, and sáṃgṛbhītā also modifies the neut. pl. kṛtā́ni with no
grammatical difficulty.</p>

<p>The verb samájāti lacks an overt object; the standard tr. supply ‘booty’.
This lexeme sometimes takes an acc. expressing the prize one wins (e.g., cows in
I.33.3), but other times the enemy one defeats (e.g., VII.32.7), and I see no way to
decide here.
Note how (saṃ)ájā(ti) echoes jā(míbhir) … ájā(mibhir).</p>
<h3 id="i10012">I.100.12</h3>
<p>The hapax camrīṣá- is taken by the standard tr. as a personal name. This
tactic may be safe, but it ignores the word’s similarity to several others, particularly
the hapax camríṣ- in I.56.1, a word usually rendered as ‘ladle’. Old, ad I.56.1, makes
the offhand suggestion that our camrīṣá- is related to camara- ‘yak’, a word not
attested until the gṛhya sūtras. Although ‘yak’ might work in our passage, the gap in
attestation and the morphological differences make this connection quite shaky.
More promising are several words found in the RV for soma cup/beaker: camasáand camū́-, as well as the root cam ‘sip, slurp’ (see Gotō 1987: 136). camrīṣá (and
camríṣ-) may be secondarily built to a *cam-ra- derived from this root (for the
suffixes -īṣá- and -íṣ- see AiG II.2.462–63 and 364–67 respectively) and thus
derivationally parallel to cam-ū́- and cam-asá-. I therefore take camrīṣá- as
belonging to the same semantic sphere as camasá- and camū́- and as the designation
of a large cup or beaker. The problem that then arises is why Indra would be
compared to such a thing; this aberrant simile may be responsible for the resistance
to connecting camrīṣá- with the other cam- words. But this is only an apparent
problem. The point of comparison is Indra’s vastness (śávasā), the capaciousness
with which he encompasses the peoples and natural features of the world (see also
14ab). An exactly parallel image is found in I.61.9, where Indra is called “a
reverberant tankard” (svarír ámatraḥ).</p>
<h3 id="i10013">I.100.13</h3>
<p>Most tr. take a and b as separate clauses, to avoid direct comparison of the
mace (vájraḥ) with the bellowing (raváthaḥ), but I consider this another example of
the condensed and deliberately off-balance syntax of this hymn: the mace that roars
is compared directly to the similar sound emanating from heaven; in other words, the
verb krandati in the frame is transformed into the noun raváthaḥ in the simile.</p>
<h3 id="i10014">I.100.14</h3>
<p>Having described the vastness of Indra’s power throughout the hymn, the
poet now implicitly attributes the same vastness to his own hymn (ukthám) by
juxtaposing it with Indra’s mā́nam ‘measure’, which encompasses the two worlds.
With Old I take mā́nam ukthám as “coordinated and asyndetic.”</p>
<h3 id="i10017">I.100.17</h3>
<p>The first hemistich appears to contain a pun on the patronymic of the poets
named in cd, vārṣāgirā́ḥ &ndash; with vṛ́ṣṇe in a, corresponding to the 1st compound
member, and (abhí) gṛṇanti in b, to the root √gṝ ‘sing, greet’ found in the 2nd. The
pun supports the derivation of vārṣagirá- from *vṛṣā-gír- ‘having a bullish song’ (so
Gr) rather than from *varṣā-gír- ‘welcoming the rain’, as suggested by Scar (112)
and endorsed by Mayrhofer (Personnamen, 82–83). The semantics of the proposed
bull-compound seem superior to the proposed rain-compound, and the pun provides
further evidence in its favor.</p>

phonological figure. It is generally taken as a derivative of √aś
i ‘eat’, meaning
‘gefrässig’ (standard tr., as well as Gr, AiG II.2.491, EWA s.v. aś
i
) &ndash; hence my
‘insatiable’, which is meant to produce a similar phonetic figure. I do wonder, though,
if it’s not a derivative of √śvas ‘snort, pant’, which would make it also an
etymological figure with śúṣṇa-, used proleptically to mean “(wrenched him down)
(to become) breathless.” The phrase is almost always the object of a verb of violence,
as here, and the proleptic adjective fits these contexts. For similar accent on a
negated -a-stem compound, cf. akṣára- ‘imperishable’, ajára- ‘unaging’, adábha-

<p>The referent of the dual dhéne “two streams” is not clear to me. Ge takes it
as ‘lips’ (&lt; ‘the sucking ones’; see ad I.2.3), but in no other passage is ‘lips’ a
possibility. Bloomfield (JAOS 46) suggests it is an elliptical dual, for prayers and
libations, expressed by dhénāḥ and dhā́rāḥ respectively in III.1.9, but this relies on
an outdated interpretation of dhénā- (see comm. ad I.2.3). H.-P. Schmidt (Fs.
Nyberg) also considers it an elliptical dual, but is himself somewhat elliptical about
what the ellipsis would be &ndash; it seems that he considers it both literal (streams of
milk) and figurative (streams of song). But RVic poets elsewhere do not resort to the
dual to express a literal/metaphorical split. Re takes it as two streams of soma
(without identifying which these would be), and WG as two milk-streams (again
unidentified). I am inclined to assume that it has been attracted into the dual from the
more regular pl. dhénāḥ by the immediately preceding śípre ‘two lips’, given the
strict parallelism in syntax and phonology in the two clauses in this pāda: ví ṣyasva
śípre ví sṛjasva dhéne, although the existence of another dual dhéne in V.30.9 in an
obscure context, may weaken this attraction hypothesis.</p>
<h3 id="i102-1">I.102</h3>
<p>Indra</p>
<h3 id="i1021">I.102.1</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., I interpret the first half-verse very differently
from the standard tr. The three major deviations from the ordinary interpretations are
the following: 1) I take te in pāda a as referring to the poet, who is also the subj. of
the 1st ps. verb prá bhare. This is the most radical of the departures and requires the
most special pleading. 2) Rather than the loc. sg. of neut. stotrá- ‘praise song’ (a loc.
not found elsewhere in the RV), I take stotré as the dat. sg. of the agent noun stotár-
‘praiser’, coreferential with te in a. This dat. is very common in the RV. 3) I take the
first two words of b (asyá stotré) with the main cl. in a, starting the rel. cl. with
dhiṣáṇā. This accords better with the placement patterns of yá- subordinators, which
ordinarily do not follow more than one constituent.
As for the first departure, as I have pointed out elsewhere (see comm. on
I.70.10), the 2nd sg. middle forms of the impv. (prá) bharasva/bhárasva (I.79.10,
VII.88.1) are specialized for the self-address of the poet. Here, with the middle prá
bhare I think the poet is speaking in the 1st ps. but addressing himself in the 2nd. I do
have to admit that prá √bhr̥+ DAT. otherwise has the divinity in the dative and so the
te in 2nd position in the verse would immediately be interpreted as referring to Indra -</p>
<ul>
<li>and, I have to argue, only as the verse unfolded would the referent be reinterpreted
as the poet. Despite the complications of my interpretation, it solves the difficulties
that arise from the standard interpr. First, that interpr. must take the maháḥ as
coreferential with te (e.g., Re “à toi (qui es) grand”), but this makes the whole phrase
genitival, and, as noted, the prá √bhṛ construction takes a dative (of the many exx.,
cf. I.143.1 prá … dhītím agnáye, … bhare). Then a referent must be supplied for the
asyá opening pāda b; most supply “the singer.” (Under my interpretation, the
genitives maháḥ … asyá are construed together and refer to Indra, while te … stotré
is the datival phrase.) And the problems I already mentioned, that stotré is otherwise
only the dative of the agent noun and that yád comes too late to govern the whole b
pāda, also remain in the standard tr.
But what does it mean, in my interpretation, when the poet says “I present to
you this thought,” with both “I” and “you” referring to himself. As I suggest in the
publ. intro., the poet is announcing that he has finished composing the hymn, which
can now be recited to the god at the ritual performance, also by himself (the poet). A
slightly attenuated alternative would be to take te as referring to a different member
of the larger group of ritual performers, who is charged with reciting the hymn that
“I” have just composed.</li>

<h3 id="i1022">I.102.2</h3>
<p>The phrase dyā́vākṣā́mā pṛthivī́is striking because pṛthivī́‘earth’ either
doubles the less common ‘earth’ word kṣā́mā in the du. dvandva or else serves as the
epithet (‘the broad’) it historically was. Indeed because pṛthivī́is grammatically
ambiguous (sg. or du.), it could modify both heaven and earth, or it could stand as a
second elliptical du. referring to both. The same phrase is found in III.8.8 and, with -
bhū́mī rather than kṣā́mā, in X.65.4.
I believe that there is a closer connection between the two halves of the verse
than the standard tr. seem to. In my opinion the sun and moon roam alternately in
order to provide constant illumination, so that we can see Indra’s “wondrous form
lovely to see” (darśatáṃ vápuḥ) and therefore put trust in him, that is, in his
existence. Remember that a constant source of worried speculation in the RV is
whether Indra exists or not &ndash; a worry that is regularly alleviated by his epiphany on
our ritual ground. Here the mere sight of his form will allay our worries and allow us
to trust that he exists. Ge attributes the actions of cd just to the fact that Indra is the
creator of sun and moon, while Re has us looking at the sky.</p>
<h3 id="i1023">I.102.3</h3>
<p>Re takes c with d as a single clause, but I follow Ge (/WG) in supplying
‘help’ from ab as the verb of c. Passages like I.176.5 ājā́u &hellip; prā́vaḥ&hellip; vājínam
support this latter interpr.</p>
<h3 id="i1025">I.102.5</h3>
<p>hávamānā(ḥ) is one of the uncommon, but not vanishingly rare examples of
a pres. part. functioning as the main verb of a clause. See also 103.4 below.
Given the fronted full pronoun asmā́kam in c and its contrast with the various
peoples in ab, more emphasis should have been placed on “our” in the publ. tr.</p>
<h3 id="i1026">I.102.6</h3>
<p>I tr. amita- as ‘matchless’ rather than ‘immeasurable’ because of its etym.
connection with pratimā́na- ‘match’ (6c, 8a), amātrá- ‘matchless’ (7c).
The Pp. reads akalpáḥ in c, and following this reading has led to very “free”
(so Old) tr. of the word and interpr. of the syntax (e.g., Ge “Durch seine Stärke
macht Indra ein Gegengewicht unmöglich”; Re is even freer), where “(macht)
unmöglich” for akalpá- seems distinctly odd and the syntactic relation between it and
pratimā́nam is loose at best. The difficulties disappear if we instead read loc. akalpé.
As Old points out, by accent the word should be a bahuvrīhi. The one example of
kálpa- in the RV seems to refer to arrangements, ritual or martial (IX.9.7: ávā
kálpeṣu naḥ pumas, támāṃsi soma yódhyā “help us in our arrangements, o male; the
shades of darkness must be fought”), and a bahuvrīhi “without arrangement/order”
modifying an underlying ‘battle’-word (perhaps khaja- ‘tumult’ extracted from
immediately preceding khajaṃkaráḥ) makes perfect sense in context.
This leaves an equational sentence índraḥ … pratimā́nam ójasā “by his
strength Indra is the match,” and we need only supply the specification of what he is
the match for. I sc. ‘all’ on the basis of II.12.9c, also describing Indra: yó víśvasya
pratimā́nam babhūva. However, esp. in conjunction with 8ab, it might instead be the
earth, or heaven and earth. Cf. I.52.13 (also of Indra) tvám bhuvaḥ pratimā́nam
pṛthivyā́ḥ (also 12); X.111.5 índro diváḥ pratimā́nam pṛthivyā́ḥ.</p>
<h3 id="i1027">I.102.7</h3>
<p>As in 2b we find an original epithet of the earth, mahī́‘the great one’, which
comes to be used as a straight designation of it, doubling a word that may also refer
to the earth, dhiṣáṇā. This combination also occurs elsewhere (III.31.13, X.96.10);
the former passage is an esp. close parallel to this one, in that mahī́… dhiṣáṇā sets
Indra on the attack. With Kü (224: “Dich &hellip; hat die Dhiṣaṇā entflammt”) I therefore
take titviṣe here as transitive, though in its other occurrences it is not. For another
passage in which the earth aids Indra in his heroic deeds, see IV.16.7b prā́vat te
vájram pṛthivī́…</p>
<h3 id="i1028">I.102.8</h3>
<p>Contra most tr., I prefer to take ab as separate clauses, rather than as
anticipating bhúvanam in c.
The difference between triviṣṭi-dhā́tu- and tri-dhā́tu- (used of bhū́ma in
IV.42.4) is not clear to me. The stem triviṣṭí- on its own (IV.6.4, 15.2) qualifies
Agni’s ritual actions as performed “with triple toil” (√viṣ ‘be active, labor’), but that
sense doesn’t work here. As far as I can see, it’s a way of indicating that the divisions
each have three divisions of their own, but the semantic pathway to this value is
unclear.</p>
<h3 id="i1029">I.102.9</h3>
<p>The standard tr. take upamanyú- as a PN. Mayrhofer (Personenname) voices
skepticism, however, and I see no reason not to take it as an adjective qualifying the
bard (kārú-). Though manyú- ‘battle fury’ can be a negative quality, it often is not so
viewed (esp. when it belongs to the gods), and the passionate energy it implies would
be a good trait for a poet.
The impv. kṛṇotu in d should be read (with the standard tr.) with both c and d,
with slightly different values: in c it has a straight “make X Y” sense, while in d it
participates in the idiom puráḥ √kṛ ‘make (i.e., put) in front’.</p>
<h3 id="i10210">I.102.10</h3>
<p>In b the singular loc. ājā́appears to be modified by two loc. plurals árbheṣu
and mahátsu (so Old, Ge, Re); cf. I.81.1 mahátsu ājíṣūtém árbhe with a different
imbalance of number. WG take the plurals separate from the singular (“im
Wettkampf um kleine (Dinge) und um grosse”) (see their note). This is possible but
unnecessary.</p>
<h3 id="i103-1">I.103</h3>
<p>Indra</p>
<h3 id="i1031">I.103.1</h3>
<p>On the interpr. of this verse, see publ. intro. Although my interpr. generally
follows Ge et al., I take the first two pādas as referring disjunctively to the two
locations of Indra’s power (not just to the heavenly one), an idea that is more
straightforwardly expressed in c, which I consider grammatically connected to ab.
For the notion in d of a ketú- linking heaven and earth, see III.55.2 and
VII.9.1. Despite its position I take iva as marking the following ketú- as a simile.</p>
<h3 id="i1032">I.103.2</h3>
<p>The presence of the shadowy Rauhiṇa here (otherwise only II.12.12) is an
intrusion in this Vṛtra-oriented verse. The verb that governs him, ví √bhid ‘split
apart’, returns in the next verse with ‘strongholds” as its object. The distraction of
verb and preverb with object in the middle (ábhinad rauhiṇáṃ ví) is almost iconic for
the splitting apart. For a potentially similar ex. see V.30.7.</p>
<h3 id="i1033">I.103.3</h3>
<p>The iconic splitting of verb and preverb in 2c is complemented here in b by
the polarized positioning of the NP “Dāsa strongholds,” the object of vibhindán, at
the beginning and end of the pāda: #púraḥ … dā́sīḥ#, while the preverb+verb are
univerbated in the participle (as against 2c).
Ge (/WG) take śraddádhāna ójaḥ as transitive-reflexive, “trusting in his own
power,” but as Old argues, śrád √dhā, a signature word of this set of hymns,
expresses the trust that people have in Indra, and the medial participle should
therefore be taken as a passive (so also Re). For the other occurrences of śrád √dhā
that support this interpr., see vs. 5 in this hymn (structurally paired with 3; see publ.
intro.), as well as I.102.2, 104.6–7.</p>
<h3 id="i1034">I.103.4</h3>
<p>The syntax and purport of this verse are somewhat murky, and my
interpretation differs from the various other standard ones (though it is closest to Re).
I will only present mine here, without cataloguing the differences from the others.
First, I take tád ūcúṣe as a separate clause, with a new clause beginning in the middle
of pāda a with mā́nuṣemā́yugā́ni, which I take as an acc. of extent of time, as it is
several times elsewhere (e.g., II.2.2).
The rest of the verse concerns the epithets or “names” Indra has and, in part,
how he acquires them: maghávan- ‘bounteous’ in b, vajrín- ‘mace-bearer’ in c, and
sūnúḥ (śávasaḥ) ‘son (of strength)’ in d. On Indra’s acquisition of a sequence of
names, see also VIII.80. I take c as containing the predication of the main clause,
with the pres. part. upaprayán functioning as the main verb (see I.102.5 above).
The referent of tád in the first clause is unclear. Though it may be nā́ma, as
most tr. think, I’m inclined to take it as an internal reference to the hymn that the
poet is presenting to him.
In d the expected epithet “son of strength” is truncated, lacking the śávasaḥ,
but the phonologically and derivationally parallel śrávase that immediately follows
sūnúḥ would evoke it.
On this verse as an omphalos, see publ. intr.</p>
<h3 id="i1037">I.103.7</h3>
<p>For the “deep-structure pun” in pāda b, see the publ. intro. and Jamison
1982/83 and 2007: 110-12. That the action in this clause is not to be taken literally is,
I think, signalled by the iva in the main clause in pāda a, which introduces the heroic
deed (vīryàm) supposedly depicted in b. My “as it were” renders the iva.
In c Ge takes the wives (pátnīḥ) as the wives of the gods, but in this Vṛtra
context it makes more sense to take them as the (fem.) waters whom Indra had just
released. Recall that in the great Indra-Vṛtra hymn I.32 (as well as in V.30.5,
VIII.97.18), the waters are called dāsápatnīḥ (vs. 11), “whose husband was a dāsa”
(that is, Vṛtra). This might be clearer if the publ. tr. read “His wives.”
The interpretation of the final part of this pāda, váyaś ca, is disputed. Ge
(/WG) and Re take it as an acc. of váyas- conjoined with tvā (“dir … und deiner
Kraft”). However, already Sāy considered it the nom. pl. of ví- ‘bird’, which is
equally possible grammatically, and I have adopted this interpr. (Old seems tacitly to
accept this interpretation, by citing X.80.5, which also contains birds.) Sāy’s
suggested referent is the Maruts, which makes good sense. The two groups on site at
the Vṛtra battle and able to give encouragement and praise to Indra then were the
waters and the Maruts, who, in many accounts of the myth, provided Indra with
moral and tactical support.</p>
<h3 id="i1038">I.103.8</h3>
<p>kúyava- ‘bringing bad harvest’ is ordinarily an epithet of Śuṣṇa, and I so take
it here even though it is separated from śúṣṇam by another PN. I ascribe this position
to the fact that kúyava- always appears after the caesura. However, in the next hymn
(104.3) Kuyava seems to be an independent personage, or rather there is no overt
mention of Śuṣṇa &ndash; so perhaps he should be accorded an independent existence here
as well (with the standard tr.).</p>
<h3 id="i104">I.104</h3>
<p>Indra</p>
<h3 id="i1041">I.104.1</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., s
u
vānó nā́rvā in b contains a triple pun, since the
participle s
u
vānáḥ can be read in three different ways: 1) as nom. sg. to the adj.
svāná- ‘sounding’ (√svan ‘sound’)(so Old, Re, WG); 2) as athem. med. part. to √sū
‘impel’, used passively (so Ge); 3) as athem. med. part. to √su ‘press’, also used
passively (mentioned by Ge in n. 1b). In this last case the simile would compare
Indra seating himself on the ritual ground to soma placed at the soma press. The
diction in the rest of this hemistich is quite similar to that found in soma hymns. Cf.,
e.g., IX.70.7 ā́yóniṃ sómaḥ súkrtḁ ṃ ní ṣīdati, with yóni-, a form of √kṛ
characterizing it, and the verb ní √sad. In the publ. tr. only the first of these is given,
because including a set of bracketed alternatives &ndash; &ldquo;[/ like a steed having been
impelled [/ like (soma) the steed being pressed]&rdquo; &ndash; seemed disruptive and distracting.
Pāda b contains the word váyaḥ, which raises the same question as in 103.7: is
this the plural to ví- ‘bird’ or the neuter sg. s-stem váyas- ‘vitality, vigor’? Neither of
them is an entirely natural object to vimúcyā ‘having released’ in this context. Ge
(/WG) opt for the latter, Old and Re for the birds. In the publ. tr. I treat it as a pun,
but I am not certain what either phrase would represent.
In d váhīyasaḥ is of course a comparative, but, again, so rendering it would be
awkward.</p>
<h3 id="i1042">I.104.2</h3>
<p>Unlike the standard tr. I take the two acc. plurals in b, tā́n … ádhvanaḥ,
separately, with the first referring to the ‘men’ (náraḥ) of pāda a. One might object
that since they “have come” (guḥ) to him in that pāda, he has no need to go to them
in the next, but, at least in English, “go to for help” is tantamount to “ask for help”
and need not involve any actual travel on the part of the men. And in any case he
would need to join them at the place of battle. I.71.9, which contains the phrase
ádhvanaḥ sadhá éti without tā́n, may support me.
For the pf. opt. jagamyāt, see Jamison 2009 (East and West); as exhaustively
demonstrated there, the pf. opt. has no special “perfect” value and here means simply
“should go.”
The publ. tr. reflects the emendation of ścamnan to *śamnan, suggested by Gr
and argued for in Jamison 1983: 103 n. 62. I am now less certain about this
emendation than I was then, being more sympathetic to Old’s questioning how this
corruption could have arisen. On the other hand, the Aves. gerundive scąϑβa-
(V.13.40), adduced by Ge as a cognate to a supposed root √ścam, provides no
support for a separate etymon of this shape, since it is, with Insler, better attributed to
the root *skand ‘break’, well attested in Avestan and elsewhere in Iranian. For details
see Jamison 1983 loc. cit.</p>
<h3 id="i1043">I.104.3</h3>
<p>For my general interpr. of this verse see publ. intro. I will not discuss the
various other interpretations in detail here or repeat what I said in the intro. I will
point out that most tr. take the subject of both a and b to be the Śiphā river in 4, but
this assumes that a and b are essentially repetitions of each other, which would
constitute an unartful duplication in a very artful hymn. Since pādas cd contain dual
feminines, it makes more sense to take ab as an implicit “the one … the other”
construction, with the two subjects the same as the duals in cd. One problem with
this interpr. is that the verb áva … bharate in pāda a lacks an overt object; I suggest
in the intro. that it might be defilement or pollution that is also removed ritually by
the avabhṛthá bath at the end of the classic Vedic sacrifice.
In d we find a periphrastic passive construction: haté … syātām “may the two
be smashed.” Though this periphrasis is somewhat unusual, even a stray thought of
what the 3rd du. middle opt. of the passive of √han would be (*hanyeyātām) may
explain the substitution. According to Macdonell (VG), such forms are not attested in
Vedic.</p>
<h3 id="i1044">I.104.4</h3>
<p>Likewise consult the publ. intro. for my interpr. of this verse.
In b prá … tirate, whose regular object is ā́yus- ‘lifetime’ (which I supply
here), plays off the name Āyu in the previous pāda. With Old and WG I supply
‘dawns’ with pū́rvābhiḥ, on the basis of V.48.2, adduced by Old.
I supply Sarasvatī in c, because the only other occurrence of vīrápatnī
(VI.49.7) refers to Sarasvatī.</p>
<h3 id="i1045">I.104.5</h3>
<p>Again, consult the publ. intro. As noted there, I think the unidentified female
in b is Dawn, who leads the Ārya forces across the river(s) and against the Dasyu.
The other standard tr. take her rather as Saramā, Indra’s canine sidekick, on the
fragile basis of III.31.6: the only point of contact between the two passages being the
rather generic jānatī́gāt “recognizing, she went.” I see no reason to introduce
Saramā here; Dawn has been anticipated by the apparent reference to the dawns in 4b
(pū́rvābhiḥ), and the revealing (ádarśi &ndash; a standard item of Uṣas vocabulary) of the
Dasyu’s streambed/strategy could easily happen at dawn.
In d niṣṣapín- is a hapax, but ‘without care, careless’ (√sap ‘serve, care for’)
makes sense.</p>
<h3 id="i1047">I.104.7</h3>
<p>The śrád √dhā lexeme is repeated here from the immediately preceding
pāda (6d; cf. also I.103.3, 5). Curiously the announced “trust” seems to be undercut
by manye “I think.” The phrase te asmai expressing the recipient of the trust requires
some comment. Ge seems to take te as a dative, parallel to mahatá indriyā́ya in 6d,
and asmai adverbially (“dafür”). But 6d also contains a te, which must be the
genitive limiting the dat. phrase, and such an interpretation fits better here, with te
dependent on asmai. What is the referent of asmai, whose referent should already be
present in the discourse because of the lack of accent on asmai? The easiest
interpretation is that it simply picks up indriyā́ya of 6d (so Re), but again, as in 3ab,
this would seem an unartful duplication. Although my interpr. requires taking into
account a longer stretch of discourse, it avoids the repetitive scenario. In I.103.1
Indra is credited with indriyá- in two locations, heaven and earth, and I think the dual
nature of this indriyá- is what is at issue here: the heavenly one in 6d, the one right
here (hence the near-deictic asmai) in 7a. So although asmai picks up the indriyā́ya
of 6d, it also refers to a different aspect of this referent.
Hoffmann (1967: 53, followed by WG) tentatively suggests taking cd as a
single clause. This avoids the need to supply a verb in a, but the “unprepared womb”
(Hoffmann’s “an unbereiteter Stätte”) of c does not seem to have much to do
semantically with d.
The object phrase váya āsutím in d, in conjunction with the dat. part.
kṣúdhyadbhyaḥ ‘hungering’, invites an interpretation of the pair as “food and drink”
(Ge “stärkende Speise und Trank”; Hoffmann just “Speise und Trank”; WG
“Nahrung und Trank”). But the abstract nature of váyas- should be respected, and I
also doubt that āsutí- is just any drink, rather than referring to the soma pressing. As
for what it all means &ndash; I would suggest that cd be interpreted in the context of the
rest of the hymn, particularly the outer framework depicting Indra’s aid to the Ārya
in conflict. They are here asking him not to drop them into battle without proper
means (“into an unprepared womb”); the d pāda then expresses what they need: vital
energy, that is, the physical and mental vigor required for combat, and the soma
pressing, that is, the ritual means to attract Indra and secure his aid. Vs. 9 then issues
the invitation to the soma drinking.</p>
<h3 id="i1048">I.104.8</h3>
<p>This verse details various possible bad outcomes if they do not manage to
secure his aid. As indicated in the publ. intro., I take the “eggs” (āṇḍā́) and “cups”
(pā́trā) as slangy references to male and female genitalia, or in the latter case perhaps
better ‘wombs’. I tr. -jānuṣāṇi loosely ‘contents’, but if the “cups” are wombs, then
‘progeny, offspring, brood’ would work.</p>
<h3 id="i105-1">I.105</h3>
<p>All Gods
For the structure and meaning of the hymn as a whole see the publ. intro. as
well as Jamison 2007: 82-85. In what follows here I will comment only on the details
of particular verses.</p>
<h3 id="i1051">I.105.1</h3>
<p>Most tr. take suparṇáḥ in b as referring to the moon (candrámāḥ) in a, but in
fact when suparṇá- refers to a heavenly body, it is always the sun. In keeping with
the depiction of cosmic and earthly order at the beginning of the hymn, the regular
alternation of the journeys of sun and moon opens the verse.
Most tr. take vidyutaḥ as referring not to the lightning flashes the word
usually denotes, but to stars &ndash; a departure that is simply incomprehensible to me.
The point of this verse seems fairly clear: three different sources of light in heaven
are mentioned: moon, sun, and lightning. The alternation and the courses of sun and
moon are predictable and regular, but that of the lightning is not &ndash; as “they do not
find your track” announces.
As stated in the publ. intro., I think the refrain is calling on Heaven and Earth
to bear witness to the poet’s musings. The double genitive (or dat.-gen.) me asyá,
with accented demonstrative, contrasts with te asmai in the last hymn (by the same
poet), I.104.7a. In that passage I take unaccented asmai as picking up a referent
already in the discourse, indriyá- in 6d (in accord with the usual distribution of the
accented and unaccented oblique forms of the demonstrative). Here I take it as
referring to a referent not yet in the discourse, the poet’s speech, again in accord with
the usual distribution. Ge (/WG) oddly tr. as if it were a loc. (“in solcher Lage” / “in
dieser Lage”; sim. Scar). Re takes it as coreferential with me: “moi tel (que je suis).”
Old (ZDMG 61.826 [KlSch.257]) is closest to my interpr. For a somewhat similar
expression see II.32.1ab, also X.10.5 in the Yama/Yamī hymn, in which Yama
asserts that Heaven and Earth know “this” about them: véda nāv asyá prthivī́utá
dyaúḥ.</p>
<h3 id="i1052">I.105.2</h3>
<p>Although pāda a lacks a verb, the parallel VIII.79.5 arthíno yánti céd ártham
suggests a form of ‘go’.
The rest of the verse depicts sex between a married couple, a particularly
important activity in maintaining earthly order and continuity. The mutual action,
expressed by the middle dual tuñjā́te, probably refers to the expressing of semen, as
in d, although the sexual juices of both husband and wife might be meant. In d either
the husband or the wife may be the subject of duhe, depending in part on which root
the gerund paridā́ya is assigned to: √dā ‘give’ (with pári ‘deliver, surrender’) or √dā
‘bind’. I favor a pun.</p>
<h3 id="i1053">I.105.3</h3>
<p>The first half-verse expresses fears about cosmic order, the second about
earthly order as maintained by the sacrifice. The verb in b, áva pādi, also picks up
the sex/procreation theme of 2cd, in that áva √pad is an idiom specialized for
miscarriage (Jamison, Hyenas, 203–4).</p>
<h3 id="i1054">I.105.4</h3>
<p>Most tr. take avamám as modifying yajñám, but I take it as referring to the
addressee, namely Agni (more clearly identified by his messenger role in b, dūtáḥ),
in the usual double acc. construction with √pṛch. For Agni as avamá- see IV.1.5 sá
tváṃ no agne &lsquo;vamó bhavotī́. The poet asks Agni about the fate of the sacrifice/hymn
(the “truth,” ṛtám) when it has been offered: where does it go and does anyone get
and keep it (in heaven). He wants Agni to answer, because Agni, as the messenger,
has access to both worlds.</p>
<h3 id="i1055">I.105.5</h3>
<p>Just as Agni was located in his realm, as the nearest one, in vs. 4, here the
gods’ location is given before they are asked their questions. The poet now worries
about what happens to his “truth” once it disappears from his sight and enters the
realm of the gods &ndash; is his “truth” theirs? Where did the offering he dispatched to
them end up?
Note the number discrepancy in triṣú … rocané. Though it is possible to
separate the two words (so WG) “in the luminous realm, in the three (worlds),” this
seems unnec., esp. in light of expressions like I.102.8 trī́ṇi rocanā́, V.69.1 trī́rocanā́.
Better to assume a truncated rocané(ṣu).</p>
<h3 id="i1056">I.105.6</h3>
<p>The formation of dharṇasí- is unclear; AiG II.237 classifies it as having the
almost unparalleled suffix -así-, and if it is formed to √dhṛ, as seems likely, the
intrusive -n- is another problem (though cf. RV hapax dharṇí-). The -n- could
perhaps be gotten from an extreme reduction of the -man-stem(s) dharmán- /
dhárman-, but the rest is hard to generate.
The function of the word in its pāda is also unclear, as there is no obvious
neut. for it to modify. (This adj. is otherwise always masc. and generally modifies
soma, which does not help here.) I take the two syntactically parallel pādas a and b as
each incomplete, to be completed by the other. In other words, I supply neut.
cakṣaṇam from b in a, and the neut. adj. dharṇasí from a in b.
The publ. tr. fails to tr. vaḥ in a, so modify the tr. to “Is your (vision) of truth
steadfast?” This helps solve one of the small puzzles of the verse: given Varuṇa in b
and Aryaman in c, we might expect Mitra in a &ndash; but instead we have “you,” as in 5c,
referring to the gods in general. As for the larger meaning of the questions, it may be
that the poet is asking whether rt̥á is always the same (= pūrvyám r̥tám of 4c and
pratnā́&hellip; ā́hutiḥ of 5d) or whether the gods change the rules on us.</p>
<h3 id="i1057">I.105.7</h3>
<p>I take the force of purā́+ PRES as past progressive / habitual: “was always
speaking, used to speak.”
Since the verse contrasts the previous behavior of the speaker (a good ritualist,
a hard-working poet) with his current mentally unhinged state, I take tám mā as “this
(same) me” &ndash; &ndash; identifying the new careworn me with the old unfazed me. However,
the nearly rhyming 8a (see below) may have had something to do with the tám here.
Note that ādhíyaḥ occupies the same metrical position as dūḍhíyaḥ in 6d.</p>
<h3 id="i1058">I.105.8</h3>
<p>Pāda a is almost a rhyme form with 7c tám mā viyanti ādhíyaḥ / 8a sám mā
tapanti abhitaḥ, and 8c ví adanti mā́dhíyaḥ cleverly picks up viyanti ādhíyaḥ of 7c in
a different metrical form (post-caesura trimeter, instead of dimeter).
Unlike the standard tr., I take the ribs (párśavaḥ) as a second simile, not
marked with a simile particle (unless also covered by the preceding iva) because in
the hymn in general the poet seems to express a “higher” distress than a backache &ndash;
instead a questioning of his previous mode of existence and his religious beliefs. That
pṛṣṭyāmayī́‘having a stitch in his side’ in 18d is also in a simile gives further support
to the simile interpr. here.
I.105.9–10: As noted in the publ. intro., these verses are the omphalos and are
marked, as often, by responsion and numerology. They seem to express the poet’s
vision of his connection with his distant ancestor Trita Āptya and also his vision of
(somewhat unclear) cosmic phenomena.</p>
<h3 id="i1059">I.105.9</h3>
<p>Various referents have been suggested for the seven reins. I tentatively take
them as the seven seers (note the phonological echo between raśmáyah and ṛ́ṣayaḥ),
which would allow a connection to be established both with the poetic tradition and,
if the seven seers are already equated with the stars in the Big Dipper (in the Great
Bear) as they are later, with that astronomical structure. That the next verse also
presents what appears to be an astronomical image supports this interpr. Moreover
the phrase tátrā me nā́bhir ā́tatā “to there my umbilical cord is stretched” recalls the
idiom “tie navel to navel” (sám / ā́√dā), which asserts a family connection between
the earthly poet and divine or semi-divine figures and elements in heaven. See comm.
ad I.139.1.
The verb ‘rasps’ (rebhati) may convey the sound of old man&rsquo;s voice, as would
be appropriate for an ancestor.</p>
<h3 id="i10510">I.105.10</h3>
<p>I have no idea what the exact referent of the “five oxen” is, but given their
stationing in the middle of heaven and their apparent retrograde motion, it seems that
an astronomical body (a constellation?) is referred to. Ge (/WG) take ní vāvṛtuḥ as
“sind … verschwunden,” but ní √vṛt ordinarily means ‘turn back / home’, of bovines,
and given that the subject is oxen, albeit metaphorical ones, this idiom works fine in
the passage.</p>
<h3 id="i10511">I.105.11</h3>
<p>I am completely baffled about what this verse actually describes, although
an astronomical reference is very likely. The many clashing interpretations of the
verse do not inspire confidence in any of them. I will simply point out that we seem
invited to identify the suparṇā́ḥ here with the ukṣáṇaḥ of 10a on the basis of the
repetition of the phrase mádhye (…) diváḥ and the semantic match between tasthúḥ
“they stand” (10b) and āsate “they sit” (11a), though the sg. suparṇáḥ in vs. 1 should
also be recalled.
I.105.13–14: I do not know why 13cd and 14ab are virtually identical. Perhaps it
shows that the poet/sacrificer can now make the ritual happen. The yakṣi of the 13d is
a praiṣa of sorts, and then the poet somewhat triumphantly reports that his command
worked.
I.105.12–15: This set of verses forms a small internal ring: 12 and 15 contain ṛtám
and návyam / návyaḥ (though not to the same stem: návya- in 12, the comparative
návyas- in 15, both neut. sg.), while 13–14 contain the responsive sattó (…)
manuṣvád ā́, devā́n … vidúṣtaraḥ.</p>
<h3 id="i10516">I.105.16</h3>
<p>Contains echoes of a number of previous vss. First, the asaú yáḥ opening
recalls the amī́yé openings of the two omphalos vss. (9–10), as well as the the amī́yé
of 5a, which anticipates the omphalos.
The “Ādityan path” (with one of the very rare instances of ādityá- used
adjectivally), which is not to be overstepped (ná … atikráme), recalls exactly 6cd …
aryamṇáḥ … pathā́, áti krāmema “Along the path of Aryaman might we pass beyond
[/step over] …” The path theme is also found in 11c and later in 18b.
The pravā́cyam of b repeats the proclamation theme that has also been
prominent in the hymn: pravā́cyam in 10c (an omphalos vs.), supravācanam (12b).</p>
<h3 id="i10517">I.105.17</h3>
<p>This verse, which provides Ge with his “Trita im Brunnen” interpretation,
does not seem to me to fit into the rest of the hymn, though Trita is found in 9cd in a
context much more in harmony with the rest. In the next hymn, I.106.6, it’s Kutsa the
poet who find himself in the same plight and calls upon Indra for help. The situation
fits I.106 much better than I.105, and I wonder if it has been adapted from I.106.</p>
<h3 id="i10518">I.105.18</h3>
<p>On the destabilizing effect of this verse on the structure of the hymn, see
publ. intro.

<h3 id="i1064">I.106.4</h3>
<p>The singular part. vājáyan in pāda a clashes with the 1st plural verb īmahe in
b. With Ge (/WG) we can supply a 1st singular verb (“bitte ich”) in the first pāda, but
the discordance could be ascribed simply to the loose structure of this hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i1065">I.106.5</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) take the 1st member of mánurhita- as functionally a dative (“für
Manu bestimmt.” Although this fits smoothly into the passage, I think it likely that
the standard agentive reading of 1st members of ppl. compounds should stand here.
Ge cites I.114.2 as parallel &ndash; yác cháṃ ca yóś ca mánur āyejé &ndash; but that passage
states that it was Manu who won the luck and lifetime by sacrifice. In other words he
was the agent, as he would be here in this compound.</p>

<p>All Gods</p>

An intransitive tr. is tempting (and see VII.59.4), but this stem is overwhelming
transitive elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="i108-1">I.108</h3>
<p>Indra and Agni</p>
<h3 id="i1081">I.108.1</h3>
<p>The image of the chariot looking upon the creatures is a slightly odd one.
Elsewhere (VII.61.1, X.85.18) almost identical pādas are used of the sun, and it may
be that Indra and Agni’s chariot here is identified with the sun, though such an
identification would be unusual for these gods. Bl (RR) thinks rather that the poet
“has borrowed and applied with a rather frenzied metaphor” the image of VII.61.1. It
is worth quoting his characteristically acerbic comment on the image: “The students
of the Rig-Veda are steeped in the experience of its bold, often grotesque figures of
speech, so that even a chariot that looks down from heaven excites no unusual
emotion.”</p>
<h3 id="i1083">I.108.3</h3>
<p>The signature word of this vs. is sadhryàñc- / sadhrīcīná- ‘joint(ly),
conjoined’, which occurs prominently in the first three pādas. The final pāda is dense
with phonological and etymological play: vṛ́ṣṇaḥ … vṛṣaṇā́vṛṣethām.
Ge (explicitly) and Re / Klein (DGRV I.373) / WG (all implicitly) take
vṛtrahaṇā in b as a predicate vocative (so, “you two, conjoined, are Vṛtra-smashers”).
I would prefer this interpretation, but think that the lack of accent should be taken
seriously. Moreover, given the repetition of sadhryàñc- / sadhrīcīná- just noted, it
may be that the conjunction of Indra and Agni is what is being highlighted, not their
Vṛtra-smashing.
I.108.3–4: As noted in the publ. intro., vs. 3 attributes Indra’s characteristic deed
(Vṛtra-smashing) to both gods, while vs. 4 attributes Agni’s characteristic ritual
behavior to both.</p>
<h3 id="i1084">I.108.4</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) construes the instr. phrase of pāda c with ānajānā́of pāda a (thus,
“being anointed with soma”). Since pāda b intervenes, depicting two further ritual
actions, I consider the syntactic connection of a and c unlikely, although I am
sympathetic to the desire to find something to construe the instr. tīvraíḥ sómaiḥ
páriṣiktebhiḥ with. I take that phrase rather as a loose circumstantial instrumental,
almost equivalent to a loc. absolute.
Another reason not to take this instr. with ‘being anointed’ is that soma is an
unlikely anointing medium for Agni, since it is more likely to quench the fire than to
make it blaze up. An unexpressed ‘ghee’ is the likely medium in a.
This argument leads indirectly to an issue that all comm. (Ge, Old, Re, WG,
Kü [p. 577]) raise: the actions of the first 3 pādas should be performed for the two
gods, not by them. Much energy is expended in these comments in trying to make the
gods into recipients, with the unexpressed agents being priests (e.g., Old’s quotation
of Benfey’s tr. of pāda b “für welche der Opferlöffel und das Barhis ausgebreitet ist”
[my italics]). This energy seems to me misplaced and the grammatical interpretation
over-fussy. One of Agni’s standard roles is that of priest, and the actions ascribed to
him (and Indra) here fall squarely within this role. Since Indra is identified with Agni,
he is just along for the ride, as it were &ndash; just as Agni was in the preceding vs. as
Vṛtra-smasher. Though it may seem a bit strange to have the gods already present on
the ritual ground, performing the preliminaries to the sacrifice in abc, but, in pāda d,
driving to the sacrifice, this merely switches the viewpoint to Indra’s perspective: he
always drives to the sacrifice; Agni is always already there. Since the two gods are
identified here, we see the characteristic actions of each separately, but ascribed
simultaneously to both.</p>
<h3 id="i1085">I.108.5</h3>
<p>I read cakrathuḥ of a also with b, though in a different sense. Ideally for this
sense (‘assumed, made your own’) the verb of b would have been med. cakrāthe.
The referents of tébhiḥ in d are syntactically the neut. yā́(ni) phrases in abc,
but it doesn’t make much sense to “drink with” those particular referents. It would be
possible to tr. tébhiḥ more heavily as “because of these” or the like, but I think the
answer is simpler: rhetorical patterning trumps semantics. The poet is leading up to
the loosely attached refrain of vss. 6–12, whose last pāda is identical to 5d but with
áthā rather than tébhiḥ; the tébhiḥ here serves as a transition between the earlier
verses, where the d pāda is integrated into the verse and the refrain-marked verses to
come. It is grammatically connected to but semantically estranged from the first
three pādas of 5.</p>
<h3 id="i1086">I.108.6</h3>
<p>See the publ. intro. for the place of this vs. in the structure of the hymn.
The “choosing” of pāda a reinforces the priestly roles of Agni (and Indra) in
the preceding vs., since the sacrificer’s choosing of the priests is one of the first
actions of the sacrifice &ndash; particularly common is choosing Agni as Hotar.
The lexeme ví √hvā means ‘vie in invoking’, generally referring to our
competition with other sacrificers in attempting to bring the gods, esp. Indra, to our
sacrifice. This is precisely the sense that it has here, in my view. With W. E. Hale
(Asuras 84–85), I take ásuraiḥ as referring to other human ‘lords’, in competition
with us for the attention of the gods. Given the almost complete absence from the RV
of the Asuras as a semi-divine group hostile to the Devas (for which see
Hale passim, also Jamison [Staal Ged.]), and given the standard use of ví √hvā for
competition between mortals, I cannot follow the near-universal assumption that the
later Asuras are present in this passage. The competitors that the poet is thinking of
may well be the brahmin and king in 7b and the various named groups in 8ab.
The phrasing of pāda c is unusual, and the interpretation depends crucially on
one’s interpretation of śraddhā́. As I have discussed elsewhere (1996: 176–84), I take
this resonant term to mean ‘trust’, particularly the trust between the parties involved
in a hospitality relationship (of which the sacrifice is a most important and fraught
subtype). Here the trust (śraddhā́m) of the 1st ps. speaker that his choosing will bear
fruit and his competitive invocation will be successful comes true (satyā́m) and
serves as a concretized goal of the gods’ journey that demonstrates that the trust was
not misplaced. satyá- is almost a proleptic adjective here. Most of the standard tr.
approximate this interpr; Re’s is closest to mine.
The hí in the refrain fragment ā́hí yātám (through vs. 12) is difficult to
account for under its usual functional headings. I have tentatively taken it as
emphatic (a cop-out, I realize) and tr. it as “yes!” I am not convinced by Hettrich’s
treatment (Hypotaxe 376, 379–80) ascribing its use to a conditional structure.</p>
<h3 id="i1088">I.108.8</h3>
<p>For the named peoples in ab as the sacrificers with whom the poet is
competing in vs. 6, see comments on that vs.
The two-pāda refrain of the rest of the hymn has finally taken shape here, out
of partial phrases found earlier. Note also that the beginning of the c pāda (átaḥ) and
that of the d pāda (áthā) are phonologically very close.
I.108.9–10: I do not see the purpose of two almost identical vss., but with the relative
positions of the various earths reversed. Re calls it a “renversement formulaire, d’un
type exceptionel” (EVP XIV.122).</p>
<h3 id="i10811">I.108.11</h3>
<p>The locations in pāda a are appropriate to both gods, but those in b are
distinctly odd, esp. for Indra. An almost identical pāda is found also in I.91.4, of the
domains of soma, where all three terms are fitting, and in I.59.3 of the locations of
goods over which Agni presides. A similar listing but without the mountains is found
in III.22.2 of Agni (yád óṣadhīṣv apsv ā̀…), which again is apt for Agni. One has the
feeling that the poet is trying to multiply the “wherever you are” verses and is not too
scrupulous about his sources.</p>
<h3 id="i109-1">I.109</h3>
<p>Indra and Agni</p>
<h3 id="i1091">I.109.1</h3>
<p>The kinship theme of the first hemistich is continued in pāda c, with
prámati- ‘solicitude’, since this abstract noun is regularly identified with the father &ndash;
e.g., I.31.10 tvám agne prámatis tvám pitā́si naḥ. See further disc. ad I.71.7.
I.109.1–2: These two vss. are parallel in structure, with an initial hí clause with a 1st
sg. augmented verb of perception (‘see’, ‘hear’), with kinship terms in the second
pāda, and in the last pāda a 1st sg. verb of production (‘fashion’, ‘beget’) with a
verbal product as obj. (‘thought’, ‘praise’).</p>
<h3 id="i1092">I.109.2</h3>
<p>The standard word for son-in-law is simply jā́mātar-; the ví- is presumably a
disparaging prefix (see Ge’s n. 2a), here rendered by “no-count.” śyālá- is found only
here in the RV, but is reasonably well attested in later texts and has good MIA
correspondents.</p>
<h3 id="i1093">I.109.3</h3>
<p>The context of this verse is clearly the soma sacrifice, but there is no general
agreement on the identity (/-ties) of the participants. I am inclined to see the pl. bulls
as the pressing stones, which are then renumbered as dual in the last pāda. Pressing
stones are called bulls, are yoked, have reins, and are plural in pressing-stone hymns
(for all these, see, e.g., X.94, esp. vss. 6–8). But it is also possible that the bulls here
are the priests guiding the stones. I find highly unlikely Old’s view that the two
stones in d are Indra and Agni.</p>
<h3 id="i1094">I.109.4</h3>
<p>In the ritual actions depicted in pāda d, apsú most naturally goes with ā́
dhāvatam and mádhunā with pṛṅktám. Old insists that this must be the interpr., and
all standard tr. follow him one way or the other. However, both the word order and,
more importantly, the accent on pṛṅktám make that impossible, if we take the text
seriously. The poet must have meant the ritual reversal.</p>
<h3 id="i1095">I.109.5</h3>
<p>The first hemistich echoes 2ab, with a 1st sg. past tense of √śru, a dual
pronominal obj. referring to Indra and Agni, of which a compared adjective
(comparative / superlative) is predicated. See also Watkins 1995: 187.
In d I read with Old (and the standard tr.) prácarṣaṇī; see also Thieme (KlSch
252). This requires no change to the Saṃhitā text, but only to the Pp., which analyses
the sequence as two words. The next pāda begins prá carṣaníbhyaḥ, which definitely
consists of two words, which could easily have led to the Pp. separation.</p>
<h3 id="i1097">I.109.7</h3>
<p>I do not entirely understand the purport of the second half-verse. Ge
compares VII.76.4, which shows some similarities and which refers to the forefathers
finding the light of the dawn cows in the Vala cave. Much closer by is vs. 12 of the
last hymn (I.108), in which Indra and Agni are urged to become exhilarated at sun
rise in the middle of heaven. One way or another this must be a reference to the dawn
sacrifice.</p>
<h3 id="i110">I.110</h3>
<p>Ṛbhus</p>
<h3 id="i1101">I.110.1</h3>
<p>As Ge points out, the mention of the All Gods (viśvádevya-) marks the ritual
reference as the Third Pressing, which is dedicated to the All Gods and in which the
Ṛbhus have their share. This suggests that the repeated stretching in pāda a need not
refer only to the periodic nature of Vedic sacrifice over the ritual year, but also
perhaps to the repeated rites of the Soma pressing day. Since the theme of the “leftover” is prominent in the Third Pressing (see Jamison 1996: 129–32), “being
stretched out again” fits this context.</p>
<h3 id="i1102">I.110.2</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., the wandering Ṛbhus seem here to be
compared to the poet and his ilk, tramp craftsmen in search of skilled work &ndash; as Ge
already suggests. (For more on itinerant priests and poets, esp. the Prātaritvan, see
Jamison 1996: 184–89.)
In pāda b ápākāḥ is universally interpreted as ‘westward’, derived from
ápāñc-, contrasted with immediately following prā́ñcaḥ ‘facing eastward’. So, e.g.,
Ge “Als ihr … westwärts, ostwärts weiter zoget.” Although the direction words
frequently co-occur, one might expect the stem formations here to be parallel, that is,
using a form of ápāñc- rather than a derivative. Cf., e.g., prā́g ápāg údāk (III.53.11,
VIII.4.1=VIII.65.1). Moreover, the Ṛbhus’ journey seems to be purposeful and
directed, given the two prá forms (… prá … aítana … prā́ñcaḥ) and the fact that
they reach a goal. I take ápāka- instead as a privative form of pā́ka- ‘callow,
simple(ton)’, hence ‘not simple; clever, shrewd’; cf. ámūra- ‘not stupid, no fool’ to
mūrá- ‘stupid’.
The tone of the locution máma ké cid āpáyaḥ is somewhat hard to read; it is
reminiscent of V.52.12 té me ké cin ná tāyávaḥ. The effect seems to be
approximative &ndash; “some kind of X,” “more or less like X” &ndash; and slightly slangy. The
referent of the máma is the 1st ps. speaker of vs. 1, contra Re, who takes the phrase as
the direct speech of (one of?) the Ṛbhus.</p>
<h3 id="i1103">I.110.3</h3>
<p>ā́suvat ‘impelled’ is of course a pun on Savitar, its subject.
The final pāda is parallel to 2a: … prá yád ichánta aítana / … yác
chravayánta aítana, each with a pres. part. combined with the main verb aítana.
What exactly is happening in 3d is unclear, since Agohya is a shadowy figure in
Ṛbhu mythology. In Ṛbhu hymns they sleep in his house (I.161.11, IV.33.7); the
most similar passage to ours is I.161.13, where the Rbhus ̥ after their sleep ask him
ágohya ká idáṃ no abūbudhat “O Agohya, who has awakened us here/now?” In our
passage the mirror-image action seems to be depicted &ndash; they&rsquo;re making him heed,
that is, waking him up. I do not know what to do with this observation, however.</p>
<h3 id="i1104">I.110.4</h3>
<p>I do not understand why the Ṛbhus are called vāghát- here, since this term is
ordinarily used of ritual officiants (see comm. ad I.3.5) and the Ṛbhus only indirectly
participate in ritual. Ge tr. “die fahrende (?) Sänger,” but he provides no support for
the itinerant part of the tr.
As Ge points out, sū́ra-cakṣas- is characteristic of gods; in I.89.7 it is used
almost as a definition of such. So it may well here be an ancillary indication that the
Ṛbhus achieved divine status.</p>
<h3 id="i1105">I.110.5</h3>
<p>úpastutā in the Saṃhitā text is universally taken, flg. the Pp., as the nom. pl.
of the past part., úpastutāḥ. I take it rather as the loc. sg. of úpastuti- ‘praiseinvocation’. It doesn’t make sense to me that, after having been praised, they would
be “crying in want” and seeking (further?) fame, whereas if they lack praise at the
praise invocation, their seeking fame is understandable. Loc. sg. -ā to -i-stems is
found only interior in the pāda as here, but almost always before consonants.
However, AiG III.152 counts 9 occurrences before -u-/-ū-, as here.
Ge and Re take upamám as the obj. of nā́dhamānāḥ, but that stem is never
transitive (as Re admits), and it appears in the preceding hymn (I.109.3) in clear
intransitive usage. I take the adj. with śrávaḥ in d. It would also be possible to take it
as an adverb: “in utmost need.” WG construe it with the cup in b; this seems the least
likely possibility, since the miraculous deed of the Ṛbhus is depicted only in the first
hemistich, quite separately their quest for fame in the second.</p>
<h3 id="i1106">I.110.6</h3>
<p>The conceptual basis for the common trope of “pouring prayers” is made
clear here by the simile “like ghee with a ladle.”
Because of its lack of accent asya cannot modify pitúḥ and it should have a
referent already present in the discourse. The referent is generally taken as the cup of
5 and its father as Tvaṣṭar. I do not have anything better to offer.
Ge’s tr. of c seems very loose and somewhat puzzling: “… die die
Pünktlichkeit seines Vaters erreichten &hellip;” He seems to be taking taraṇitvā́as neut. pl.
rather than instr. sg. (like taraṇitvéna in 4a) and imposing a meaning “erreichten” on
saściré that stretches the semantics of that stem. Re makes a good case for the instr.
interpretation, and supplies an acc. “(l’exemple)” that allows the usual ‘follow’ sense
for the verb. My tr. is similar.
vā́ja- in d is a low-key pun on the name of one of the Ṛbhus.</p>
<h3 id="i1107">I.110.7</h3>
<p>In my interpr. the individuation of the Ṛbhus continues in ab, though not
with their usual names.
Note the switch in number between the opening of 6d ṛbhávo vā́jam (pl. – sg.)
and that of 7b ṛbhúr vā́jebhiḥ (sg. – pl.).
In b the instr. pls. vā́jebhir vásubhiḥ are ordinarily taken as proper names and
instr. of accompaniment. I instead take them as defining the quality for which the
Ṛbhu gets designated ‘good one’ and ‘giver’. My tr. also assumes a chiastic structure
in vā́jebhir vásubhiḥ vásur dadíḥ, with the first instr. construed with the last nom. sg.
and the middle two terms belonging together.
The analysis of pṛtsutí- is debated (see, e.g., Re EVP XIII.108; AiG II.2.640
§473aβA.; III.73, §29b; II.1 Nachtr. 67). On the one hand, it appears to be a
compound consisting of the root noun pṛ́t- and a primary -ti-stem, probably to √sū
‘impel’ (with shortening, like sú-ṣuti to the other root √sū ‘give birth’). On the other,
since the root noun pṛ́t- is only attested in the loc. pl. pṛtsú (though the root is also
found in the derivatives pṛ́tanā-, etc.), pṛtsutí- appears to be a secondary -tí- stem
anomalously built to a case form. This seems to be the current standard view.
However, it seems entirely possible to me that we are dealing with a haplology of
*pṛtsu-sutí- (or -sūtí-), and my tr. reflects this analysis.</p>
<h3 id="i1109">I.110.9</h3>
<p>Again the standard tr. take vájebhiḥ as a proper name.</p>

<p>Ṛbhus</p>
<h3 id="i1111">I.111.1</h3>
<p>vidmanā́pasaḥ is formally odd, though clear in meaning. Given the
independent instr. vidmánā in the preceding hymn (I.110.6), we might expect a
phrase *vidmánā *apásaḥ “working with know-how,” with the internally derived
apás- ‘laboring’ to neut. ápas- ‘labor’. But though the sandhi would support this
interpr., the accents are wrong on both words. For Wackernagel’s somewhat
confused treatment of the cmpd., see comm. ad I.31.1. The correct analysis is, in my
view, vidmanā-ápas-, a bahuvrīhi built to the neut. s-stem ápas- ‘labor’, work’, with
the instr. to vidmán- as 1st member. The 2nd member receives the accent, somewhat
unusually for a bahuvrīhi, like some other cmpds. with -as-stems as 2nd member.
Ge refuses to tr. vṛ́ṣaṇvasū, which seems just peevish, given the far more
difficult words he’s willing to tr.</p>

<h3 id="i1121">I.112.1</h3>
<p>pūrvácitti- is variously interpreted and much discussed: see the long notes of
Ge and Re ad loc., as well as Old, KlSch 1152–56 (=NG 1916). The stem always
occurs in the dat. and displays (quasi-)infinitival usage. Although it would be
possible to take it as “(for me/us) to think first (of them)” and in the first pāda of a
hymn this would be easily interpretable as a ritual reference, I consider it to have the
opposite value: “(for them) to think first (of me/us).” Kutsa repeatedly calls on
Heaven and Earth to be witness to his speech in the refrain of I.105: vittám me asyá
rodasī. Cf. also X.35.1 mahī́dyā́vāprthiv ̥ ī́cetatām ápaḥ “Let great Heaven and Earth
take cognizance of (our) work.” For further on pūrvácittaye see comm. ad IX.99.5.
The stem iṣṭí- is a perennial problem, since it can belong to several different
roots: √iṣ ‘desire, seek’, √iṣ ‘send, impel’, or √yaj ‘sacrifice’. Ge (n. 1b) takes it
here to an intransitive iṣ ‘rasch, gern willig kommen, eilen’, though his tr. ‘sich
beeilen’ might seem to connect it with a reflexive sense of ‘send, impel’. By isolating
iṣṭáye from the acc. gharmám, he then needs to supply another verb to govern that
acc., namely “(zu kochen).” Old (KlSch 282–84 [=ZDMG 62 (1908)]), however,
gives good reasons to connect our iṣṭáye with ‘seek’, though his interpr. of this pāda
differs somewhat from mine. So also Re (see his n.). WG opt for ‘send’.</p>
<h3 id="i1122">I.112.2</h3>
<p>This verse is very dense and has been subject(ed) to a variety of
interpretations, the details of which can’t be laid out here. The first hemistich depicts
gifts or some other desirable things mounting the chariot of the Aśvins to be given.
The gifts are qualified as subhárāḥ ‘easy to carry (away?)’ and ‘inexhaustible’
(asaścatáḥ); the latter word generally qualifies ‘streams’, objects that are not
ordinarily capable of mounting anything. This already odd image (of gifts [implicitly
compared to streams] performing the mounting) is made odder by the simile in b,
which compares the chariot to something eloquent (vacasám) for thinking (mántave).
It is of course not unusual for a verbal product (a hymn vel sim.) to be compared to a
chariot, but the semantic distance traversed in this hemistich is quite far. This outré
simile referring to the chariot may anticipate 4c below.
I wonder if the hapax thematic vacasá- (in acc. vacasám) is wrongly accented
for *vacásam, which could be an internally derived possessive adj. to the neut. s-stem
vácas- ‘speech’. Although this putative *vacás- ‘having speech, eloquent’ would
likewise be a hapax, it would belong to a standard derivational type. BR (and
Monier-Williams) take just this word as a derivative of √vañc ‘move waveringly’,
which certainly would better fit a chariot. But the following the following mántave
strongly favors a derivative of √vac, given the common conjunction of thought and
speech.
The final phrase of c, kárman iṣṭáye echoes that of 1b yā́man iṣṭáye, and the
two forms of iṣṭáye should therefore be interpreted in the same way. I take dhíyaḥ
‘insights’ as the object of the seeking and supply “(us)” as the subject of the infinitive.
Others tr., with different interpretations of iṣṭáye, have taken different routes.</p>
<h3 id="i1123">I.112.3</h3>
<p>The phrase divyásya praśā́sane can be read in (at least) two different ways:
either the Aśvins are “in command” of the divine (that is, they command the divine)
or “at the command” of the divine (that is, the divine gives them the command). I
follow Ge in taking it as the latter; he cleverly suggests that this shows the Aśvins in
their proper position between gods and men &ndash; in other words, they are middle
management.</p>
<h3 id="i1124">I.112.4</h3>
<p>As discussed in the publ. intro., this verse seems to display extended double
reference between three gods associated with the morning pressing and the Aśvins’
chariot, an association produced by shared epithets, though I must admit that there
are many loose ends in this interpretation. See also Re’s n.
In pāda a párijman- ‘earth-encircler’ is a standard epithet of their chariot
(I.20.3, IV.45.1, X.39.1, X.41.1, IV.3.6)(and, in the dual, of the Aśvins themselves:
I.46.14, X.106.3). In a verse in an Aśvin hymn in which this is the first real word, it
is hard to imagine that an audience would not first think of their chariot. However,
the term also qualifies the Wind (e.g., VII.40.6, II.38.2), and the rest of pāda a,
tánayasya majmánā, fits a divinity better than a chariot.
In its other three occurrences dvimātár- ‘having two mothers’ refers to Agni,
as produced by the two kindling sticks. It is somewhat difficult to see how this word
could refer to the chariot, unless the Aśvins are configured as two mothers. On the
other hand the phrase dhūrṣú taráṇayaḥ, like our tūrṣú taráṇiḥ, is found in an Aśvin
hymn (VII.6.78) qualifying their horses in a verse also containing their chariot. (Cf.
also taráṇi- twice in another Aśvin hymn [IV.45.5, 7], but used of a priest, probably
Agni.) Note also that tūrṣú not only plays on the dhūrṣú in the passage just cited, but
also phonologically matches the ū ṣú of this hymn’s refrain.
In c vicakṣaná- ‘wide-gazing’ is otherwise esp. found as an epithet of Soma,
though occasionally of other gods. As a qualifier of a chariot, it could mean
‘conspicuous’ (&lt; ‘widely seen’). What it would mean for either Soma or the chariot
to be ‘of triple thought’ (trimántu-) is not clear to me. The word is a hapax, but it
should be interpreted along with the mántave of 2b, where the word is connected
with an image (however attenuated) of a chariot. It’s worth keeping in mind that the
Aśvins’ chariot is characterized as having three of everything in I.34.2, 9, 12, and its
three wheels are mentioned elsewhere. As for a potential connection with Soma, the
‘three’ of course suggests the three soma pressings, though exactly what the -mántuwould have to do with them isn’t clear to me. Perhaps more likely is the three types
of ritual speech deployed in the soma sacrifice.
Note that there is an implicit numerical ordering of the subjects of the three
pādas: (párijman = 1), dvimātár-, trimántu-.
In sum, although the vocabulary of this verse has tantalizing resonances with
other passages and although I am fairly certain there is a pervasive double meaning, I
do not feel I (or anyone else) has entirely “cracked” this verse. The tack taken by Ge
(/WG) of simply taking Parijman, Dvimātar, and Trimantu as PNs is the easy way
out but does not advance the interpretation.</p>

<p>On the lexeme medial ví √pā ‘extract by drinking, separate fluids by
drinking’ see disc. ad VII.22.4. Why this lexeme is used here of an ant (or someone
so called) isn’t clear. Perhaps it reflects a folk belief or observation about the
eating/drinking habits of ants. Popular Science Monthly (of May 1877) reports that
“Some species—such, for instance, as the small brown garden ant—ascend bushes in
search of aphides. The ant then taps the aphis gently with her antennæ, and the aphis
emits a drop of sweet fluid, which the ant drinks.” This could possibly be considered
extraction. And a more recent article (Smithsonian.com, Aug. 16, 2012) has
photographs of transparent Indian ants whose abdomens change color depending on
the color of what they drink. The photographs of the ants’ mouth parts attempting to
penetrate drops of colored water could also be viewed as extraction.</p>

<p>Note the phonological play in páṭharvā jáṭharasya. Because of its accent,
Ge (/WG) take jáṭhara- as an adjectival deriv. of jaṭhára- ‘belly’, hence ‘paunchy’
(supposedly of his wagon). But I think it likely that its accent simply follows its
phonological twin páṭharvā, which immediately precedes (see also Old). The only
possible indication of the independent existence of jáṭhara- is jáṭhala- in I.182.6.</p>
<h3 id="i11218">I.112.18</h3>
<p>The problem of the sg. voc. aṅgiraḥ is treated by Old.
The verb niraṇyáthaḥ is also problematic; in fact Ge declines to tr. it. Re
suggests that it might be a corruption of *ni(r)-riṇīthaḥ to nír √rī ‘let flow, let
escape’, but the corruption involved would have to be fairly massive and would be
unmotivated. Old sees it as a denom. to a form derived from √ran ‘take pleasure’.
WG tr. “ihr … innerlich Freude habt,” following Gotō 1987: 258 n. 582, who accepts
Gr’s connection with √ran ‘take pleasure’, though he attributes the accentuation not
to a passive stem raṇyá- (as Gr does, despite the active ending) but to a shift from the
standard pres. stem ráṇya- by association with denominatives like turaṇyá- (or
perhaps to its being a denominative itself). This analysis is accepted by Kulikov
(Vedic -ya-presents, pp. 605–5), with further discussion. Although a connection with
√ran makes more sense than Re’s suggestion, it does not make much sense in
context &ndash; or rather, although the tr. is harmless and not jarring, it has nothing to do
with the Vala myth treated in the following pāda. It is also the case that √ran does
not otherwise occur with ní and forms of this root are also almost always construed
with a source from which the pleasure is derived. By contrast, my tr. follows a
suggestion of Brereton’s that it is haplologized from *nirayaṇa-yá- ‘seek/find a way
out&rsquo;. Despite the further machinery required, this interpr. makes more sense in the
Vala myth context.</p>
<h3 id="i11220">I.112.20</h3>
<p>The problem in these obscure fragments of tales is to decide which of the
words are PNs and which are adjs. In c Ge takes the three fem. acc. as separate
names, but I prefer to take omiyā́vatīm and subhárām as proleptic adjectives, since
both stems are found earlier in the hymn in full lexical usage (omyā́vantam 7b,
subhárā(ḥ) 2a). Sim. Scar (p. 639), Remmer (Frauennamen, p. 85).</p>
<h3 id="i11221">I.112.21</h3>
<p>Pāda c presents a major disruption of the pattern that has monotonously
structured this hymn since vs. 5; this disruption may signal the approaching end of
the hymn. Unlike every c-pāda in the hymn (starting indeed with vs. 1) save for the
immediately preceding one, the pāda doesn’t begin with yā́bhiḥ (11c doesn’t actually
begin with yā́bhiḥ, but it is found within the pāda). Moreover the verb bharathaḥ is
not accented and therefore cannot be in even a notional relative clause, despite the
yád that immediately follows it. Curiously, most interpr. ignore or explain away
these deviations. Ge. tr. as a “wenn” clause and considers yád “Attraktion für yā́bhiḥ”
(attraction to what he doesn’t say). Old ascribes yád for yā́bhiḥ to metrical needs and
wishes to accent bharathaḥ, because switching to a main clause is “recht
unwahrscheinlich.” Since the poet clearly had no problem maintaining his template
in verse after verse, I find it impossible to believe that the departures from this
structure here are not deliberate &ndash; a kind of putting on the brakes before the end, just
as the full template took awhile to take shape at the beginning of the hymn. More
recent tr. reflect the verse’s structure better: WG make c a parenthetical clause
(though, oddly, repeating the “attraction” explan. in the n.); Scar (p. 444) also treats
the clause as parenthetical.
The formally ambiguous saráḍbhyaḥ is taken by Ge (/WG) as dative, but
given real-world knowledge &ndash; bees produce honey and don’t need it brought to them
&ndash; it surely makes better sense as an ablative (so also Lü., Scar.), in what looks almost
like an izafe construction: yát saráḍbhyaḥ.</p>
<h3 id="i11224">I.112.24</h3>
<p>To avoid vegetative confusion, ‘fruitful’ would be better tr. as ‘profitable’
(ápnasvatīm). See ápnaḥ in the next hymn (I.113.9d).
Ge tr. adyūtyé as “wo nicht der Würfel entscheidet”; this is certainly possible,
but I think it more likely refers to a situation dire enough that we don’t want to take
chances.</p>
<h3 id="i113-1">I.113</h3>
<p>Dawn</p>
<h3 id="i1131">I.113.1</h3>
<p>Ge suggests, probably correctly, that b concerns Agni.
Though most tr., explicitly or implicitly, take Night as subj. of c as well as d,
it makes more sense to me for Dawn and Night to be contrastive subjects of the final
two pādas, with Dawn going forth as Night cedes her place. The balanced contrast is
brought out strongly in the next two vss.</p>
<h3 id="i1134">I.113.4</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take citrā́as the subj. of ví … āvaḥ, not of áceti, but the
phonological and etymological figure áceti citrā́and the position of the preverb ví in
tmesis (surely initial in its syntagm) make this unlikely.</p>
<h3 id="i1135">I.113.5</h3>
<p>The form ābhogáya (thus in sandhi) has been much discussed. With Old I
take it as a loc. ābhogáye to the same stem (whatever its source) as ābhogáyam in a
previous Kutsa hymn, I.110.2. I do not think it is a dative, either in infinitival use or
as a dat. obj. parallel to rāyé of the infinitival iṣṭáye.</p>
<h3 id="i1136">I.113.6</h3>
<p>Ge takes ártham iva as a real simile, containing a pun on ártha- (though he
does not call attention to it): “um (an sein Geschäft) wie nach einem Reiseziel zu
gehen,” with ártha- ‘business’ in the frame and ‘goal’ in the simile. This is clever
and may well be right. In my publ. tr. I take iva as a sort of indefinitizer: “whatever
his goal.” WG by contrast seem to take it as a definitizer: “um just zum Ziel zu
gehen,” which seems an odd use of iva.
The standard tr. construe c with d and the phrase vísadṛśā jīvitā́as object of
abhipracákṣe (e.g., Re “Afins qu’ils considèrent les (modes d’) existence divers,
l’Aurore a éveillé toutes les créatures”). I am skeptical of the syntax, because the dpāda is a refrain. Although in some refrain hymns, the refrain is sometimes
integrated into the verse as a whole, this refrain does not seem to work that way.
Moreover, the sense conveyed seems contrary to what preceded it: the creatures in
5–6ab seems single-mindedly intent on their own particular goals, not open to
contemplating different “lifestyles.” I therefore take c as an independent clause,
summarizing 5–6ab: different people have different aims. This requires taking neut.
jīvitā́as ‘living beings’, rather than ‘modes of living’. I would prefer that it was not
neut., but cf. neut. bhúvanāni (in the refrain and often elsewhere) ‘creatures’. jīvitáis found only once elsewhere in the RV in IV.54.2, where it seems to mean ‘lives’.
I.113.7–13: These verses have a surprising density of forms of ví √vas ‘dawn forth’
(7b, d, 8c, 9b, 10b [2x], 11b, 12d, 13a, b, c), whereas vss. 1–6 lack any such forms &ndash;
though there’s a teasing echo in 4b ví … āvaḥ ‘She opened, uncovered’, belonging,
however, to √vṛ. See also comments on vs. 14.</p>
<h3 id="i11310">I.113.10</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., this is the most challenging verse of the hymn.
Note the phonetic figure kíyāti(y) ā́yát samáyā bhávāti, which may help
account for the unusual lengthening in kíyāti (for expected kíyati, which is the Pp.
reading). The only other occurrence of this loc. (II.30.1) is also followed by ā́,
though the figure stops there. See AiG III.256 for various alternative explanations of
the long ā.
The crucial term for the interpr. of the verse is the instr. adverbial samáyā,
which is universally taken as ‘in the middle’ in its various occurrences, presumably
from something like “with the same (on both sides).” But this doesn’t really make
sense here: since today’s Dawn is precisely in the middle between the former ones
and the ones to come, at what point she will be there is not a question we need to ask.
A different interpr. of the word arises from examining all the occurrences in context.
Every passage crucially contains the preverb/particle ví (save for VII.66.15, where
víśvam takes its place):</p>
<h3 id="i566-1">I.56.6</h3>
<p>ví vṛtrásya samáyā pāṣyā̀rujaḥ</p>
<h3 id="i736-1">I.73.6</h3>
<p>ví síndhavaḥ samáyā sasrur ádrim</p>

IX.75.4 rómāṇy ávyā samáyā ví dhāvati
IX.85.5 vy àvyáyaṃ samáyā vā́ram arṣasi
Since ví ‘apart’ and sám ‘together’ are oppositional preverbs that frequently work
formulaically with each other, samáyā seems to partake more in the semantics of sám
than of samá- ‘same’ and to mean ‘altogether’, ‘all at once’, or ‘together with’. I take
it in the last meaning here: the question being asked is when the current Dawn will
be (re)joined with her sister Dawns, both preceding and following her.</p>
<h3 id="i11311">I.113.11</h3>
<p>With Gr (et al.) I take praticákṣyā as the gerundive; cf. I.124.8.</p>
<h3 id="i11312">I.113.12</h3>
<p>Pāda b contains complex phonetic echoes: sumnāvárī sūnṛ́tā īráyantī, with
repeated su/ū as well as mirror-image árī / īrá mediated by ṛ́; the n in each word and
the final ī of the first and third could be added.
In c the phrase bíbhratī devávītim is somewhat puzzling; devávīti- generally
refers to humans’ ‘pursuit of the gods’, that is, the fervent invitation to the gods to
partake of our sacrifice. It should not, therefore, be something that Dawn “brings,” as
she brings prizes, for example. I therefore take the fem. part. bíbhratī in its birth
sense: she bears / brings to birth our pursuit of the gods by waking us up to initiate
this pursuit. Cf. a similar birth context in 19d.</p>
<h3 id="i11313">I.113.13</h3>
<p>Note that in this verse a single Dawn subsumes the various temporal dawns
of the surrounding vss.</p>
<h3 id="i11314">I.113.14</h3>
<p>This verse plays on the lexeme ví √vas that dominated vss. 7-13. The verse
begins with the preverb ví, setting up the expectation that a form of √vas will follow.
But instead the pāda ends with adyaut, a near synonym. The next pāda does end with
āvaḥ, which matches (vy) ā̀vaḥ of 13b but belongs instead to the root √vṛ ‘(un)cover’.
The verb is here construed with pāda-initial ápa, but the dominant preverb ví is
implied by the immediate preceding word (de)vī́(devy ā̀vah). Cf. also remarks on 4b
ví … āvaḥ ‘She opened, uncovered’ above.</p>
<h3 id="i11315">I.113.15</h3>
<p>Another in the series of ví SHINE verbs is found in d vy àśvait, whose ví is
reinforced by the pāda-initial vi in vibhātīnā́m.
Note also the chiastic phonetic figure in b: citráṃ ketúṃ kṛṇute cekitānā; the
distribution of i and u vowels is also chiastic, but skips the verb. This is also a triple
etymological figure, of course (minus kṛṇute).</p>
<h3 id="i11317">I.113.17</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take the singer, the subject of ab, as the human singer, which in
turn requires them to interpret the mid. part. stávānaḥ, which is overwhelmingly
passive in value, as having active meaning. I (and independently WG) take the
referent in ab to be Agni (so already, tentatively, Old). This not only allows stávānaḥ
to be interpreted in its usual fashion, but also fits the rest of the lexicon. Agni is
regularly called váhni- in his standard role as conveyor of the oblation, and he is also
called ‘hoarse-voiced’ because he crackles (cf. I.127.10, VI.3.6, VI.11.3).</p>
<h3 id="i11318">I.113.18</h3>
<p>My interpr. of the 2nd hemistich differs in several respects from the standard.
In d I take aśvadā́(ḥ) ‘giving horses’ as acc. pl. fem. with the dawns (so also Re,
Scar), not nom. sg. masc. with the soma-presser. Although the latter is possible (and
aśvadā́- is elsewhere used of mortal patrons), it seems here to belong with the
characterizations of the dawns in pāda a: gómatīḥ … sárvavīrā(ḥ). Note that Dawn is
addressed as aśva-sūnrt̥ e ‘liberal with horses’ in V.79.1–10.
More radical is my interpr. of pāda c, which is much discussed (see elaborate
notes of Old, Ge, and Re; also Scar 66–67, somewhat differently 202, 617). Most
take the simile vāyór iva to refer to the surging up of gifts as swiftly as the wind; in
other words the unexpressed common quality is the speed with which the gifts come.
I think rather that the hapax udarká- refers to the ‘raising’ of the litany that
accompanies the distribution of the dakṣiṇās at the Morning Pressing. (Cf. udṛ́c- RV
2x “when the chant is raised.”) And this litany is compared to the one accompanying
the first offering of the Morning Pressing to Vāyu. Note that personified sūnṛ̥́tā is
closely associated with Vāyu in the two nearby Vāyu hymns I.134.1 and I.135.7.
That it is not the physical aspect of wind that is at issue is suggested by the use of
vāyú- not vā́ta-, as Re points out.</p>
<h3 id="i114">I.114</h3>
<p>Rudra
By RVic standards this hymn is almost laughably simple and elementary, very
different from Kutsa’s usual products.
There is much repetition and chaining of vocabulary in this hymn:
kṣayádvīra- is prominent at the beg. (1-3, + 10), with vīra- reprised in 3 and 8. See

marked by 1st pl. verbs.</p>
<h3 id="i1142">I.114.2</h3>
<p>The weak pf. form (ā)yejé is anomalous in two regards: it does not agree
with the standard weak pf. īj- and it produces a bad cadence here. The form is found
twice elsewhere in the RV: āyejé in X.63.7 where Manu is also the subj. and the form
is in the same (bad) metrical slot – the two passages seem to be connected – and
VI.36.2 with the preverbs ánu prá and in an acceptable metrical slot. The weak pf.
stem īj is not found with preceding preverb. The forms are disc. at length by Kü
(391–92) with ample citation of previous lit. Schindler considers īj the older form, to
the laryngeal-initial root (PIE*Hia̯ ǵ) with reduplication *Hi-Hij-́ , in contrast to *ia̯ -
initial roots, which redupl. *ia̯ -iC. For Schindler the yej forms are metrically driven
replacements and serve to avoid the coalescence of the vowel of the preverb + īj, esp.
in the cadence. (Neither he nor Kü seems to recognize that the yej forms produce bad
cadences, a problem that undercuts the arguments that both of them use to explain
their appearance in this context.) Kü by contrast questions Schindler’s posited
distinction in redupl. between initial laryngeal roots *Hia̯ C and glide-initial *ia̯ C,
since the development of super-weak forms of the type ūcúr to √vac happens to roots
without initial laryngeals, only glides. Kü argues that whether or not the root had a
preceding initial laryngeal the redupl. to a *(H)i/̯u̯aC root was originally always
*(H)i/̯ua̯ -. The u/i-type redupl. developed by analogy to *(H)ai/̯uC̯ - roots. Therefore
īj is an inner-Vedic development, not an archaism per Schindler. Yet – even though
he thinks yej shows the older reduplication pattern – he still allows the possibility
that it’s a new formation nonetheless. Kü’s disc. is ultimately indecisive.
As for the metrical problem, Ludwig and Arnold want to emend to *āyajé, of
somewhat dubious morphological provenance. I very tentatively suggest another
possibility, that in this preverb-verb combination the underlying form was *ā
(H)i(H)ij-ai, with the i-reduplication becoming a glide between ā and the redupl.
syllable, which was then originally short: *āyijé. The drawback to this explanation
(or one of them) is that there is no obvious source for the -ej that was substituted at
some point in the redaction.</p>

<p>The bahuvrīhi áriṣta-vīra- ‘possessing heroes who cannot be harmed’ in 3d

pāda-init. mā́found through all of vs. 7 and the 1st half of 8 is broken here so that
rīriṣah / vīrā́n can be juxtaposed.
The final pāda of the vs. also recalls vs. 3, in a somewhat sly way: 3d ends
juhavāma te havíḥ “We will pour you an oblation,” with an etymological figure as

<p>The image of men stretching their yokes across may refer in part, as Ge

of the morning sacrifice: the root √tan ‘stretch’ is regularly used of the sacrifice

I.115.4–5: As indicated in the publ. intro., although at the time I was not certain what
these verses depict, I was (and remain) skeptical of the notion that the two hemistichs
refer to the so-called day-sun and night-sun respectively, as Ge (/WG in part) and Re
take it. Among other things, I find it unlikely that the unequivocal proclamation of
the Sun’s supremacy that begins this verse (tát sū́ryasya devatváṃ tán mahitvám
“This is the Sun&rsquo;s divinity, this his greatness”) would pertain to what these scholars
see in 4d: the rather ignominious bundling up of the Sun in Night’s garment to sneak
him back across the sky to rise again the next day. I now feel I have a much clearer
understanding of what is going on in these verses &ndash; I think I have cracked their code
&ndash; and it all refers to the rising sun. I will lay it out below.</p>
<h3 id="i1154">I.115.4</h3>
<p>Pāda b fairly clear refers to Night interrupting her weaving of darkness and
gathering up her work when the Sun hitches up his horses for his morning journey. I
take Night to be the subject of sáṃ jabhāra, not the Sun (as do Ge, Re, Maurer),
based on the similarity to II.38.4 púnaḥ sám avyad vítataṃ váyantī, madhyā́kártor ny
àdhāc chákma dhī́raḥ “Once again the weaver has wrapped up what was stretched
out; in the middle of his work the mindful (worker) has set down his craft,” where
the weaver is the one who wraps up his own work.
I would now likely connect c with b, rather than only with d: “in the middle of
(her) work (Night) has gathered together what was stretched out, when he (=Sun) has
yoked his tawny horses from their seat.” This would more clearly explain what the
divinity and greatness of the Sun consist of and sketch a cause-and-effect relationship
between the sun’s beginning his journey and Night’s breaking off her work.
This leaves pāda d. As noted above, Ge and Re think Night covers the sun
with her dark garment and turns him into the night sun (see Ge’s n.: “Die Nacht hüllt
jetzt den Sūrya in ihr Gewand, d. h. in Dunkel; sie macht die Tages- zur
Nachtsonne.”) However, the actual wording of the Sanskrit text doesn’t work
particularly well in this night-sun scenario: stretching the garment for him is not the
same as wrapping him in it. Still, on the surface it works even less well in my
scenario in which only the day-sun is depicted in this verse. Others take this pāda as I
do, as continuing the depiction of sunrise, but have not produced convincing ways to
make the Sanskrit work that way. Maurer tr. “then upon herself Night spreads her
garment,” with the comment (p. 174) “she puts the garment she has woven upon
herself, thus removing it from the world and allowing the light of the sun to take its
place.” This would solve the problem, but “herself” must render simásmai, which
must be masc. (or neut)., not fem. (though see Ge’s suggested way out of this
difficulty in his n. 5 to his n. 4d: that simásmai stands for a reflexive like ātmán- and
is therefore masc.). WG also believe that this verse concerns only the morning sun.
See disc. in the notes, though I am puzzled by how the disc. and the tr. relate. Their
interpr. of d seems to me to fall short.
In my view Night’s stretching her garment for him is in part a gesture of
submission: she recognizes the sun’s ascendancy (both literally and conceptually)
and removes her black garment and spreads it out for him to pass over, to indicate
that she yields to his superior power. (Fortunately she doesn’t have Clytemnestra
tendencies.) But this image also depicts a real-world phenomenon, that of the sun
rising through morning mist or dark clouds clustering at the horizon. These can be
seen as the remnants of the darkness of Night, the garment she has discarded at the
place on the edge of the visible world where the sun first emerges. The pāda begins
with ā́d ‘just after that’ &ndash; namely, just after he has yoked his horses from their seat,
the beginning of his journey &ndash; suggesting that this is the first moment of sunrise.</p>
<h3 id="i1155">I.115.5</h3>
<p>This verse (esp. cd) works better in the day-sun / night-sun model than vs. 4,
but I am still skeptical about that interpr. and can provide one that allows the verse to
confine itself to sunrise. I am especially dubious about the version of the day-sun /
night-sun model promulgated by Ge (/WG), Re &ndash; that the two surfaces of the sun are
Mitra (bright) and Varuṇa (dark) respectively &ndash; since this interpretation is likely
anachronistic as it rests on a later Vedic conception of the two deities. Freed from
that model, I take the genitives mitrásya váruṇasya of pāda a as dependent not on
rūpám in b with most tr., but with abhicákṣe, following Maurer’s rendering of the
syntax, hence my “for Mitra and Varuṇa to see.” This interpr. may be syntactically
problematic, as we would expect a dative subject &ndash; and do find a dative subject with
this infinitive, even several times in Kutsa’s oeuvre (I.102.2 asmé
sūryācandramásābhicákṣe “for us to see the sun and moon”; I.113.6 dabhrám
páśyadbhya urviyā́vicákṣe “for (even) those who see (only) a little to gaze out
widely”). The case discrepancy troubles me, but I must assume that, given that
infinitives are verbal nouns, nominal rection prevailed here. It might better be
translated “for the sight of M+V.”
This interpretation fits the verse better conceptually and makes a nice
thematic ring with 1b, which contains the common trope of the sun as the eye of
Mitra and Varuṇa, using the word cákṣuḥ, derivationally related to (abhi-)cákṣe. The
expression in our vs. is ambiguous; it could be turning the notion of sight on its head
&ndash; M+V are seeing the sun, not seeing by means of him &ndash; or, more likely, intends the
same idea as “the eye of M+V” in 1b, “so that M+V can see (the world).”
The position of anyád … anyád in cd requires that they be definite and in a
“the one … the other” relationship (so all tr.). The gleaming surface of c fits well into
my scenario &ndash; it is another image of the bright eye of M+V depicted in ab. I think it
is called anantá- ‘unbounded’ to represent the fact that it is not possible (certainly
not advisable) to look at the bright sun in the sky and see its outline, its edge. But the
complementary black surface of pāda d seems, on first thought, to impose the nightsun image. However, it is easily interpretable within the framework provided by the
other troublesome d-pāda, 4d. As I just argued, the garment that Night stretches for
the sun in 4d is her discarded black raiment that lingers at the horizon as mist and
clouds. When the sun rises through clouds, it can seem almost dark, certainly in
comparison to an unclouded sun, and its outline is clearly visible, as opposed to the
anantá- surface of the bright sun in pāda c. At such an occluded sunrise, individual
bright rays can shoot out of the clouds. In our passage these would be the harítaḥ
‘tawny horses’ that are jointly bringing him (sám bharanti), the same harítaḥ he
hitched up in 4c before beginning his journey through the mists of 4d.
Thus we can construct a consistent and convincingly naturalistic interpr. of
these two verses as referring only to sunrise, without the dubious baggage of the
“night-sun.” The second of the two verses, which is the last real verse of the hymn,
also forms a ring with vs. 1: not only is the sun identified as the eye/sight of Mitra
and Varuṇa (1b, 5a), but the “brilliant face” (citrám … ánīkam) of 1a is reprised by
the “gleaming surface” (rúśat … pā́jaḥ) of 5c.

<p>Indra or the All Gods
This is a very problematic hymn, and both the publ. tr. and this comm. are
tentative and tenuous on many points. There are some quirks that reappear
throughout the hymn: a remarkable no. of pāda-final góḥ (2b, 2d, 7b, 9a) – is this
some sort of hidden encoding? It’s also part of a pattern of favoring pāda-final
monosyllables (vrā́m 2c, rā́ṭ 3a, dyū́n 3b, 7c, dyā́m 3d, vaḥ 4d, nṝ́n 12a, 13a, dā́t 12c
– and, flg. Hoffmann, daḥ 10d). Also a fondness for pári and prá, the former esp. in
opaque contexts.</p>
<h3 id="i1211">I.121.1</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) take pāda a as a separate clause and consider pā́tram ‘cup, vessel’
a metaphorical designation of Indra (“Ist er wohl das rechte Gefäss für solch
gottergebene Männer?”). With Old I consider this to be an anachronistic application
of the much later sense of ‘cup, bowl’ to mean ‘appropriate recipient’. (It is true that
Indra is referred to as a ‘tankard’ [I.61.9] and a ‘beaker’ [I.100.12] elsewhere, but in
those cases it is his capacious size that is at issue.) Old and Re both avoid the Indra =
cup interpretation by supplying a verb (different verbs in each case). I see no reason
to supply a verb, since pā́tram can be an acc. goal with turaṇyán (see X.61.11 for
another acc. of goal with the same stem), a possibility also allowed by Old.
On nṝ́n as gen. pl. see AiG III.211–12.</p>
<h3 id="i1212">I.121.2</h3>
<p>Ge and Re take náro as the nom. sg. of a thematic form of the ‘man’ stem, a
nom. sg. that is otherwise not found in the RV (save possibly in svàrṇara-) and only
very sparingly in the rest of Vedic (see AiG III.212). I follow Gr, Old, and WG in
taking it as a gen. sg. of the athematic ‘man’ stem, even though the other two
occurrences registered by Gr are better taken as nom. pl. It replaces expected *nur
(cf. Aves. nərəš). It is parallel here to góḥ, and this gen. expression characterizes the
type of dráviṇa- that Indra is providing as a prize. Since dráviṇa- is a derivative of
√dru ‘run’, it really is ‘moveable wealth’, and both cattle and men would qualify.
The pair náro góḥ is echoed by the more conventional expression cátuṣpade …
dvipā́de in 3d, which also contains the qualifier náryāya.
The opening ṛbhúr vā́jāya contains the names of two of the three Ṛbhus,
though the words are not so used here.
As indicated in the publ. intro., the second hemistich is much discussed, and I
will not treat other interpretations in detail. It depicts a buffalo (mahiṣá-) gazing after
(and probably longing after) three females, or, in my interpr., one female in three
different shapes. These shapes are three standard female roles, arranged
chronologically: marriageable girl (according to my interpr. of vrā́- as ‘chooser’; see
comm. VIII.2.6), wife/consort (ménā- &lt; ‘exchange token’; see comm. I.62.7), and
mother. The mahiṣá- is Indra, as often; this word also evokes the term for the chief
wife of a king, máhiṣī-, thus indirectly adding another female role. I identify the
female referent of all three as Dawn. Kakṣīvant calls Dawn “begetter of cows”
(gávāṃ jánitrī) in nearby I.124.5, like our mātáraṃ góḥ, and also compares her to a
vrā́- in I.124.8. Since Dawn is always depicted in motion, “gaze after (a retreating
figure)” is an appropriate verb. (Cf. IV.18.3 where Indra anu √cakṣ his mother who
is going away: parāyatī́m mātáram ánv acaṣṭa.) If the referent is Dawn, then the
horse whose consort she is is probably the sun. For Dawn and the horse = sun, see
VII.77.3.
The term svajā́- ‘self-created’ has two applications in the passage. On the one
hand, it characterizes the vrā́- particularly. Since she is a ‘chooser’, the female
protagonist of a svayaṃvara (self-choice) marriage, she is ‘self-created’ because she
is not being given to someone by someone else, but is doing it herself. If marriage is
the equivalent of upanayana and second birth for women, then she’s her own parent.
On the other hand, it can characterize all the role transformations she undergoes in cd,
loosely “(re)creating herself as …” For further on vrā́- and this passage in general,
see Jamison 2003 (Fs. H.-P. Schmidt) pp. 45–47, also X.111.3.</p>
<h3 id="i1213">I.121.3</h3>
<p>In the publ. tr. this verse is couched in the English future because I took two
of the three verbs in the verse (nákṣat and tastámbhat) as subjunctives and the third
(tákṣat) as an injunctive but a rhyme form to nákṣat, each of them beginning a
hemistich. I considered the verse a continuation of the prospective questions in vs. 1.
about Indra’s coming to the sacrifice. I have now accepted the view of Narten
(Sig.Aor. 160; see also Hoffmann Injunk. 144) that nákṣat is instead an injunctive to
the thematic stem of the enlarged root √nakṣ. This then seems to strand tastámbhat
as a lone subjunctive in this sequence; Kü (575) labels it a subjunctive in preterital
context. However, the passage may originally have had the indic. pf. *tastámbha, and
tasthámbhat may have picked up a final dental from the initial of the following word:
tastámbhad dyā́m# to match preceding nákṣat and tákṣat. Since dyā́m begins with a
cluster, the meter is unaffected by a reading *tastámbha dyā́m. The cadence is
terrible (four heavy syllables), but the only thing that would improve it is reading
*tastabha(d), with a zero-grade root syllable appropriate neither to the indicative nor
to the subjunctive.
Revising my understanding of the morphology requires revising the
translation as well. I would now take the whole verse in the past: “The surpassing
king came through the days to the age-old call of the clans of the Aṅgirases for the
ruddy (cows). He fashioned the mace, his team-mate; he propped up heaven for the
sake of the two-footed and four-footed belonging to men.” The verse then provides a
reassuring model in the past for Indra’s hoped-for activity in the present. Note that
nákṣat picks up the aor. ā́naṭ (approximately) from 1c and tastámbha(t) the aor.
stámbhīt of 2a.
Ge takes aruṇī́ḥ as nom. sg. fem., appositive to rā́ṭ, which must then be fem.
and mean ‘queen’ (“die Morgenröte, die Königin”). Both of these are grammatically
possible: rā́ṭ must be fem. in V.46.8; aruṇī́ḥ must be nom. sg. in IV.1.16, 14.3. But
this leaves the apparent masc. nom. sg. adj. turáḥ without a head. I therefore take
aruṇī́ḥ as acc. pl., loosely construed with hávam. See Old. The ruddy ones are
presumably the cows imprisoned in the Vala cave, who reappear (with a different
color term, usríya-) in vs. 4.</p>
<h3 id="i1214">I.121.4</h3>
<p>Unlike the standard tr. I take c with ab rather than with d. I also take the
subject of that pāda, the referent of trikakúb ‘three-humped’, as the herd, not Indra
with most tr. The problem is the verb, nivártat. On the surface it is the only active
form to the quite well-attested them. pres. vártate. It could be taken as an
oppositional transitive active built (however temporarily) to the intransitive middle.
Since ní √vṛt generally means ‘turn back’ (of bovines), it could mean ‘(make) turn
back’, with Indra as subject (called trikakúb). The problem is that this doesn’t make a
lot of sense in context. He has just released them (or so I take ab); why then at their
“forward surge” (prasárge) would he make them reverse direction? What I think the
pāda depicts is the cows milling around in cow-like fashion and beginning to move,
but something stops or confuses them, turning them back (pāda c), and Indra has to
step in and show them the way out (pādas ab, d). A (partial) solution to this difficulty
was seen by Hoffmann (Aufs. II, 590), who identifies several forms as belonging to
an intransitive root aorist to √vṛt, to which this would be the subjunctive, rather than
belonging to the them. pres. stem. Since the forms are intransitive, this solves my
valency problem, but the subjunctive causes some difficulties. Hoffman takes pāda c
as a purpose clause “Damit er beim Losrennen (der Kühe) als Spitzentier
zurückkehre,” but why, again, would Indra turn back? To make it fit my scenario,
with the herd as subject, I need to read it as a past prospective. Indra got them on the
way to truth when they were going to / would have turned back. I would slightly
amend my tr. to “when the three-humped (herd) was going to turn back in its forward
surge.”
There is another possible conceptual solution, also utilizing Hoffmann’s
intransitive root aorist subjunctive. As already noted, ní √vṛt means ‘turn back’ of
bovines &ndash; see the extraordinary concentration of this lexeme in X.19, a hymn urging
the cows to return. If we assume that once the cows trapped in the Vala cave are
released, they will return home (which would be expressed by ní √vrṭ), then nivártat
is compatible with prasárge: “so that the three-humped (herd) will return (home) in
its forward surge.”
In d I take ápa … vaḥ in two slightly different senses with two different
objects: ‘uncover’ with drúhaḥ ‘deceits’ and ‘unclose’ (= ‘open’) with dúraḥ ‘doors’
(note the phonological similarity of the two objects). Unlike many tr. I therefore do
not take drúhaḥ as gen. dependent on dúraḥ; I also consider mā́nuṣasya as a gen. of
benefit rather than construing it with drúhaḥ (for both, cf. Re’s “les portes du Mal
humain”).</p>
<h3 id="i1215">I.121.5</h3>
<p>Under this elaborate disguise, the verse is simply about soma and Indra’s
possession of it. The parents are, acdg. to most, Heaven and Earth.</p>
<h3 id="i1216">I.121.6</h3>
<p>Another verse about soma.
Note the position of ná in the simile, where it is placed after the two-word
DET+NOUN phrase (asyā́uṣásaḥ) rather than after the first word. I do not know if this
placement is by rule; it might be worth looking for other examples with this
configuration. In fact, see I.129.1g with imā́ṃ vā́caṃ ná.
The syntax is somewhat clotted in the 2nd hemistich. With Ge I take yébhiḥ as
standing for *yád ebhíḥ vel sim., since there is no masc. pl. referent in the main
clause. Ge (/WG) and Re construe the instr. without further verbal support (Ge “mit
Hilfe der ihren Schweiss opfernden (Priester)”). I supply ‘being impelled’ to account
for the instr.; such expressions are relatively common in soma hymns; cf. IX.30.2 =
107.26 índur hiyānáḥ sotṛ́bhiḥ, etc. For sweat as an oblation, see Jamison 2015
(“Avestan xṣ̌uuīd-: A Relic of Indo-Iranian Ritual Vocabulary,” BAI 25).
The siñcán of d causes some conceptual problems. Active forms of this very
common stem are transitive (‘pour x’), but if the subject remains the drop (índuḥ), a
passive ‘being poured’ would seem to make more sense. However, this attribution of
agency to the drop &ndash; to pour himself, as it were &ndash; fits with the general tendency to
animatize soma and attribute exceptional powers to him.
WG take jaráṇā as a nom. sg. fem., an abstract “Langlebigkeit,” conceived of
as a goddess, as opposed to its standard interpr. as a neut. pl. adj. modifying dhā́ma
and essentially identical to differently accented jaraṇá- ‘old’ (Ge, Re, though not Gr).
For WG this goddess is the one who pours with the spoon and reaches the seat. This
is clever but runs into difficulties. First, forms to √jṛ generally convey a negative
sense of ‘age’ &ndash; not ‘long life’. And it interferes with a standard soma trope, of the
pressed soma going to / reaching his “domains,” which is straightforwardly present
here as long as índuḥ remains the subject. And as far as I know, there is no other
evidence for this goddess.</p>
<h3 id="i1217">I.121.7</h3>
<p>Another very obscure verse with multiple competing interpretations. I will
only discuss my own. As indicated in the publ. intro. I think the larger point of the
verse is that Indra’s presence alone is sufficient for an effective sacrifice, even if the
standard ritual trappings (like the wood for the fire) are absent. This rests in part on
very different interpr. of the individual lexical items, esp. in pāda a.
To start there, the hapax vanádhiti- is interpr. by Ge (/WG), Scar (57), going
back to Sāy, as an axe, the Holzmacherin, in part because of the phonological play
with a standard word for ‘axe’ svádhiti-. I follow Gr (Old, Re, Schmidt B+I 147) in
taking it rather as the pile of wood for the kindling of the ritual fire, formed like
vásu-dhiti- ‘treasure chamber, depository of goods’; cf. also mitrá-dhiti- in the
adjacent hymn (I.120.9). The verb in this clause, apasyā́t, is universally considered a
subjunctive to a denom. stem apas-yá- ‘be active’ (a stem that would appear only
here, though there are related nominal forms); I interpret it rather as the optative of
ápa √as ‘be’ (hence apa-syā́t) ‘be away, be distant’. True, this lexeme is not
common &ndash; I have found only one other RVic example (X.83.5) &ndash; but it would be
easy to create, with additive semantics, and semantically parallel ápa √bhū is better
established.
There is no agreement on the sense of pāda b or even its syntactic status:
because it lacks an overt verb, it is not clear whether it continues the subordinate
clause of pāda or functions as the main clause. (With Ge et al., I assume it is the main
clause, since otherwise the verse consists only of subordinate clauses.) It is generally
assumed that a finite verb should be supplied with pári; I supply the inoffensive ‘go’.
My interpr. of the pāda is, on the other hand, rather bold &ndash; there seems no other
choice with pādas like these. I take the cowpens (ródhanā góḥ) as a reference to the
ritual ground or to the vessels containing the milk to be mixed with soma or perhaps
to places where animals are kept for sacrifice. The “sun” that goes around them is
either Agni performing the paryagnikaraṇa, the circling around ritual objects or
sacrificial animals (the latter might make more sense with cowpens), or Soma
circling through the purifying filter. Both Agni and Soma are frequently identified
with the sun.
But the mediating image for pāda b is the radiant Indra of pāda c. When Indra
(such is my identification of the subj. of the 2nd sg. prabhā́si) shines forth, there is no
need of wood for the fire (pāda a). He can stand in for the ritual fire and/or the
gleaming soma and bring the sacrifice to a successful conclusion by himself, as it
were.
My identification of Indra as the subj. of c makes him unavailable to be the
referent of the datives in d, as Ge, Re take them. In my view, the poet Kakṣīvant is a
better candidate (see WG, who suggest “Sippenführer,” so at least not a god). For
one thing, if the curious hapax cmpd ánarviś- contains the (pseudo-)loc. ánar- to
ánas- ‘cart’, it seems unlikely that this would qualify anyone directly associated with
Indra &ndash; the cart is not a warrior’s vehicle &ndash; while on the other hand the Pajras,
Kakṣīvant’s clan (cf., e.g., I.116.7, 117.6), are ánasvant- ‘possessing carts / wagons’
(or, more accurately, compared to people who are ánasvant-) in I.126.5. Although
turá- was used of Indra in 3b and would here be applied to Kakṣīvant, this poet
would surely not mind getting a little reflected divine glory. Note, in passing, the
phonetic echo in ánarviśe paś
u
viṣe.</p>
<h3 id="i1218">I.121.8</h3>
<p>The major puzzle in this verse is the grammatical identity of its first word,
aṣṭā́. Ge takes as the agent noun to √aś ‘attain’, which is not otherwise attested (and
for which we should expect full grade *naṣṭár-), while Old, Re, Scar (602), WG take
it as ‘eight’ (which of course requires some clever manoeuvering with its head noun,
dual hárī). I follow Sāy, Gr in taking it as the ppl. to √(n)aś.
On the sense of vātā́pya- see comm. ad IX.93.5. The scansion of this stem is
unclear: HvN give it as vā̃tā́pyam, that is, presumably, vāatā́pyam, Arnold (p. 294)
vaatā́pyam (with short first vowel), but Old vātaā́pyam. Ad IX.93.5 he also suggests
vātā́piyam (which wouldn’t work here), pronouncing the scansion favored by HvN
the least likely. Gr also goes for -piya-.

is difficult to fit in, since as a gen.-abl. it can’t easily be a target. See the standard tr.,
plus Hoffmann (Inj. 191), for various attempts to wrestle with this possibility.
However, the VP can instead mean “roll the stone back,” with góḥ an ablative “from
the cow” and the action depicted a friendly and helpful one. I consider this to be a
variant of the Vala myth, referring to the opening of the cave. The problem is that the
Vala myth does not ordinarily intersect with the Śuṣṇa story, which occupies the 2nd
hemistich, but, as indicated in the publ. intro., the two myths are woven together in
this part of the hymn.
Another problem is the present tense pariyā́si of d, in a hymn otherwise
couched in the mythological past. In conjunction with anantá- ‘endless’, I suggest
that the present is used here to express a past continuative ‘kept Xing’.</p>
<h3 id="i12110">I.121.10</h3>
<p>The sequence of tense/mood in this verse is somewhat puzzling, with an
impv. in the first hemistich (asya, pāda b) followed by a 2nd sg. impf. (ā́-adar, so Pp.)
or injunctive (ā́-dar, so Hoffmann, Inj. 191). This discrepancy must be why Ge puts
the first hemistich in quotation marks, though he doesn’t explain who is speaking.
In my opinion the first hemistich concerns the Vala myth: the word phaligá-
‘bolt’ is associated with the Vala myth in two of its three other occurrences (I.62.4,
IV.50.5), once of the Vṛtra myth (VIII.32.25), never of Śuṣṇa. However, if this is the
Vala myth it is somewhat puzzling why the sun is entering the dark, since the Vala
myth is usually set at dawn. Perhaps this refers to a version in which the sun is also
trapped in the Vala cave.
I supply ‘fold’ in the temporal abl. expression in pāda a, since I would expect
an acc. of goal, and pā́thas- ‘fold’ is common with ápi √i (I.162.2, II.3.9, III.8.9,
VII.47.3). On the other hand, perhaps the abl.(/gen.) támasaḥ is simply by attraction
to the abl. infinitive ápīteḥ.
As noted earlier, ā́daḥ is analyzed by Hoffmann as an injunctive in
mythological context. Note also that it probably belongs to √dṛ ‘tear’, not √dā,
despite ā́do to the latter root in 8a. However, it could technically be underlyingly
identical to ā́do, and that pāda also contains a diváḥ. In that case it would mean “you
took …”</p>
<h3 id="i12111">I.121.11</h3>
<p>Hoffmann (191 n. 157) insists that ánu … madatām must be an impv. This
interpr. is of course possible, but I do not see its necessity. He also interprets
siṣvapaḥ as a subjunctive. This is also possible, esp. because the other two forms to
this redupl. aor. are athematic (síṣvap). However, again it is not necessary, since
redupl. aorists are overwhelmingly thematic, and old athematic ones get thematized
(cf. augmented ádīdharat beside dīdhar).
I have no idea why it’s worth mentioning that Heaven and Earth have no
wheels, a seemingly obvious fact, unless to contrast them with Etaśa and the Sun’s
wheel in 13b.
In d the easiest thing to do with acc. varā́hum ‘boar’ is to take it as an
appositive to vṛtrám (much earlier in the hemistich). But the problem, of course, is
that Vṛtra isn’t a boar but a cobra (/serpent). Indra’s boar opponent is Emuṣa, and
that may be the referent. (See I.61.6–7, where the Vṛtra and Emuṣa myths are told in
two successive verses.) However, given that the Śuṣṇa myth is related here in the two
preceding verses (9–10), I think that Śuṣṇa may be the referent. He does, after all,
snort (e.g., I.54.5 śvasanásya … śúṣṇasya).</p>
<h3 id="i12112">I.121.12</h3>
<p>Pāda a contains two ambiguous forms: yā́n, which can be either acc. pl.
masc. of the rel. pronoun or pres. act. part., nom. sg. masc., to the root pres. of √yā
‘drive’; ávaḥ, which can be either the 2nd sg. injunc. act. of the them. pres. to √av
‘help’ or the acc. sg. neut. of ávas- ‘aid, help’. If we take yā́n as a rel. pron., there is
the problem that there is no referent for it in the main clause (save for the Wind’s
horses, which are not likely). Despite the majority of tr., I therefore take it as the
participle, with the consequence that ávaḥ is a noun, serving as acc. of goal, rather
than a finite verb. (Its accent would be a problem in a non-relative clause.) As it turns
out, there are no injunctives to the thematic present of this root: we find either augm.
ā́vaḥ (etc.) or subj. ávāḥ (etc.); this is an additional, if weak, argument for not taking
it as a finite verb.
The adj. mandínam ‘exhilarating’ in c seems semantically far enough from its
apparent referent, vajrám in d, that Ge supplies a verb “(trink)” to produce a new
clause and allow mandínam to qualify the expected soma (see the same adj. in 8c).
This is unnecessary. Uśanā Kāvya’s major job is to give Indra the mace (see also
V.34.2) and for Indra to reach exhilaration in his company (I.51.11). In our passage it
seems as if these are conflated, and the vajra itself is what provides the exhilaration
(= the energy to kill Vṛtra bez. Śuṣṇa).</p>
<h3 id="i12113">I.121.13</h3>
<p>I take nṝ́n as a gen. pl. (see 1a) in beneficial sense.
For nā́yám see comm. on VIII.2.28 and Jamison (Hock Fs.).
In c rathyàḥ could simply mean ‘charioteers’, a parallel gift to the prizes
(vā́jān). So WG.</p>
<h3 id="i12115">I.121.15</h3>
<p>The root affiliation of sám … varanta is disputed. Most take it as belonging
to √vṛ ‘choose’ (Ge, Re [apparently, see below], WG); I follow Gr and Lub in
assigning it to √vṛ ‘cover’. Although it is difficult to judge, there are more clear root
aor. subjunctive middle forms to ‘cover’ than to ‘choose’ (though cf. I.140.13 where
varanta does belong to ‘choose’ and takes íṣam as object). Moreover, sám does not
appear to be found with ‘choose’, but is at least marginally attested with ‘cover’ (cf.
VIII.17.7 and X.16.7).
The other question about this verb is what is its subject. Ge takes íṣaḥ as the
acc. pl. obj. and supplies the singers or rich patrons as subj. (sim. WG): “Sie bitten
sich alle Genüsse (als Lohn) aus.” Inserting a 3rd ps. subject is a bit awkward in a
verse in which the human petitioners are otherwise in the 1st ps. (a asmát, c naḥ, d
syāma). Re takes íṣaḥ as the subject, in one of his finer sleights of hand: “Puissent les
jouissances-rituelles affluer (-comme-par-choix!),” where the supposed root verb
appears only in the parenthesis and the Sanskrit justification for “affluer” is entirely
unclear. I take íṣaḥ as the subject, with ‘us’ supplied as object: “completely cover
(us)” expresses the abundance of refreshments Indra will provide.</p>

<p>On pā́ntam see Old’s lengthy n. ad loc. The stem pā́nt(a)-, generally read
with distracted root syllable, occurs 8x in the RV. As Old demonstrates, there are
most likely two different stems involved: a them. noun pā́nta- ‘drink’ and the act.
part. of the root aor. of √pā ‘drink’. The noun is the more common (6x), while the
part. is most likely found only in vs. 4 of this same hymn (du. pā́ntā) and as nom. pl.
in IX.98.8 (q.v.). This distribution of forms is found in Lub, with the part. listed
under √pā (‘drink’) and the nom. stem pā́nta- separate.
The construction of the second hemistich is much discussed, including the
function of the instrumentals. See esp. Old and Re.
In this context “the lord (ásura-) of heaven” is most likely Rudra (see also
Hale, Asuras, 75), who is also the gapped object of the verb astoṣi: his heroes are his
sons, the Maruts mentioned in d.
On iṣudhyā́and the related verb, see comm. ad I.128.6 and my forthcoming
“Vedic iṣudhyá- and Old Avestan išud-, išūidiia-: The Aim of Praise.” In light of my
reconsideration of the word family of iṣudhyá- in that article, I now interpr. this vs.
somewhat differently from the publ. tr. Instead of taking ródasyoḥ as the target of the
aiming expressed by iṣudhyā́(“as if aiming at the two world-halves”), I now take
iṣudhyā́as an independent instrumental adverb of manner, with a dependent “praise”
understood: “… as if by the aiming (of an arrow of praise).” The simile particle iva,
which here, unusually, does not mark an explicit simile, draws attention to the
underlying metaphor of the aiming of praise. This image is especially appropriate for
Rudra, a god of course famous as an archer, and the Maruts, who are depicted in</p>
<h3 id="i6410-1">I.64.10</h3>
<p>ástāra íṣuṃ dadhire gábhastyoḥ as “archers taking arrows in their fists.” As
for ródasyoḥ, I take it as semi-parallel to diváḥ in c, with the two locations positioned
at the beginning and end of the hemistich. Just as Rudra is the “lord of heaven”
(diváḥ … ásurasya), the Maruts are associated with the midspace defined by the two
world-halves, not to mention their association with their consort Rodasī &ndash; so this is
also a pun. I would now tr. the hemistich as “I have praised (him) along with the
heroes of the lord of heaven; (I have praised) the Maruts of the two world-halvesas if
by the aiming (of an arrow of praise).”</p>
<h3 id="i1222">I.122.2</h3>
<p>The root affiliation of vyùta- is disputed. WG (flg. Rau) take it to √vā
‘weave’ and tr. ‘geflochten’; so also Gr. and (ultimately) Re (though he vacillates in
his n.). Most other tr. to ví √yu ‘separate’. My ‘cast-off’ comes via ‘separate, i.e., set
aside, get rid of’. Re’s “serti (d’étoiles)” (sertir =‘to set’, of jewels) does not seem to
have much to do with ‘weave’, but supplying “with stars” (stṛ́bhiḥ) as a play on
starī́ḥ is clever enough to make his interpr. appealing, though I do not in the end
accept it. A bejeweled Night does not fit well with her being starī́- ‘barren’: the
contrast is as usual between dazzlingly beautiful Dawn and dreary dark Night. Cf. the
black garment Night spreads at the horizon for the Sun in I.115.4. Night does get her
chance at ornaments in the one hymn addressed to her, X.127.</p>
<h3 id="i1223">I.122.3</h3>
<p>The 2nd member of the cmpd vasarhā́is taken by Gr and Re as -hán-, hence
‘striking at dawn’, but a connection with √hā ‘change position, move’ makes more
sense (so Ge [/WG], tentatively Scar 700). Wind does regularly rise at dawn, but it is
hard to conceive that it smites then. This probably requires us to take the underlying
form as -hā́s, contra the Pp. The 1st member vasar- is only attested here, as a variant
to the (likewise secondary) locatival uṣar. See Lundquist 2014 (25th UCLA IE Conf.,
Proceedings). The somewhat better attested vanar- ‘in the wood’, also found as 1st
cmpd member, may have provided the model for the shape of vasar-.
Ge (/WG) construe apā́m with vṛ́ṣanvān as “der Fuhrmann [coachman,
teamster] der Gewässer,” while I follow Re in tentatively supplying ‘child’ with gen.
apā́m on the basis of the next verse, which contains nápātam apā́m. Note that
elsewhere in the hymn (12b / 13a) an incomplete expression (dáśatayasya) is
repaired by the fuller form (dáśatayasya dhāséḥ). I don’t see how ‘possessing bulls’
would develop to ‘coachman’. In any case, neither of the alternatives makes much
sense as a designation of the wind; I do not know why he would be a coachman of
the waters, but I also don’t understand why he’d be the child of the waters &ndash; perhaps
because of the association of wind with rain or because wind blowing over open
water is very perceptible? (For another interpr., see Keydana, Inf., 315 n. 126 “der
Besitzer der Wasserhengste [water-stallions],” which seems to split the difference
between the ‘bull[s]/male[s]’ of the nom. and the fem. waters in a way not exactly
sanctioned by grammar.)
The curious dual dvandva indrāparvatā ‘Indra and Mountain’ is found 3x in
the RV (I.132.6, III.53.1 as well as here), always in the voc. I interpret the ‘mountain’
as a reference to Indra’s vájra-. For other passages with the vájra- as ‘mountain’, see
VI.22.6 and VII.104.19, as well as Re, EVP XVI.117 (ad VII.104.19).</p>
<h3 id="i1224">I.122.4</h3>
<p>The first hemistich is structured like vs. 2, with a nom. subject of a purpose
infinitive.
The root √śvit is a Dawn word (see I.92.12, 113.15, 124.11, the last in a
nearby Kakṣīvant hymn); I wonder if śvetanā́- is feminine because it&rsquo;s evoking Dawn
as the brightener.
Despite their similarity, with most tr. I take pā́ntam in 1a and pā́ntā here as
belonging to separate stems, the first to pā́nta- ‘drink’, the second to the act. part. to
the root aor. of √pā ‘drink’ (see disc. above ad v. 1). Immediately preceding vyántā
can be the clue to its participial identity; for the sequence see I.153.4 (of Mitra and
Varuṇa) vītám pātám páyasā …
The second hemistich with prá vaḥ … kṛṇudhvam echoes 1ab prá vaḥ …
bharadhvam, though in vs. 1 the verb is further distanced from the clause opening.
rāspiná- is a hopeless hapax, surely related to the likewise hopeless hapax
rāspirá- in V.43.14, a passage that also contains a mother (mātúṣ padé) and āyóḥ,
though not in the same configuration or meaning as here. Ge (/WG) wisely fail to tr.
Re: ‘fougueux’ (fiery, ardent), or, in his notes, ‘bouillant’ (boiling), though without
serious argumentation. (For other possibilities see KEWA s.v.; AiG III.215.)
Although it is foolhardy even to sketch derivational possibilites, I will toss out
several, with no conviction. My tentative tr. ‘abundant’(?) depends on a possible
deformation of reasonably well-attested virapśín- ‘id.’ (beside virapśá- ‘abundance’)
(derived in turn from vīra-p(a)śu-, in a well-known and generally accepted etym.).
The initial ví-, perceived as a preverb, could be lopped off, and the unusual internal
cluster -pś- metathesized and normalized to -sp-, whose order of segments and
sibilant type are both more phonologically natural. The apparent vṛddhi might be like
that of mā́hina- though they are differently accented. To account for rāspirá- we
must assume that rāspiná- was analyzed as containing a -ná-suffix, for which -ráwas substituted for no discernible reason. Another even less good possibility, which
partly goes back to Bollensen (ZDMG 22; see KEWA s.v., AiG III.215), starts from
the fact that in context both rāspiná- and rāspirá- could use an extra syllable. The
first member could be analyzed as a y-less genitive *rāás to rayí- / rāy- ‘wealth’,
compounded with a form of √pi ‘swell’. (Note that rāyás regularly shows -s sandhi
in syntagms before p: esp. rāyás póṣam, but cf. also rāyás pūrdhi.) However, our
current understanding of the historical morphology of the ‘wealth’ word makes it
well-nigh impossible to get such a -y-less form (since rāyás &lt; *raHi-̯as) without a
series of arbitrarily constructed analogies. Thus, the second possibility is essentially
ruled out, and, insofar as I think it’s worth even thinking about an etymology here, I
favor the deformation from virapśín-.
I do not know what role Āyu is playing here, as is often the case with this
figure.</p>
<h3 id="i1225">I.122.5</h3>
<p>Again the first hemistich has a predicated infinitive, like 2ab, 4ab. In fact the
structure is identical to that in 4: auśijó huvádhyai# (4b, 5a). But otherwise the verse
is difficult to comprehend (as Ge says in n. 5, “Voll dunkler Beziehungen”), and tr.
differ considerably. I will not treat them in detail.
The object(s) of huvádhyai should first be sorted out: the two acc. ruvaṇyúm
and sáṃsam. Are the two coreferential and what are their referent(s)? ruvaṇyú- is a
hapax but clearly derived from the denom. (/deverb.?) stem ruvaṇya- (also a hapax)
and ultimate from the root √ru ‘bellow, roar’. Ge (/WG) takes ruvaṇyúm as a
qualifier of śáṃsam, which he treats as a PN (“den lauten Śaṃsa”), perhaps standing
for Nāraśaṃsa. This is not impossible, but given the mysterious āyóḥ in 4d and
auśijáḥ in both 4b and 5a, I am reminded the phrase uśíjaḥ śáṃsam āyóḥ (IV.6.11,
V.3.4). In both passages we (SWJ and JPB respectively) take śáṃsam āyóḥ “the laud
of Āyu” as a designation of Agni; in both we take the form uśíjaḥ as the nom. pl.
designation of a type of priest, who do homage to Agni under this name. Note also
that II.31.6 contains śáṃsam uśíjām, with the Āyus featuring in the next verse
(II.31.7b) as makers of hymns. I therefore think that śáṃsam in this verse should be
combined with the mysterious āyóḥ at the end of the previous verse into a putative
underlying phrase *śáṃsam āyóḥ, referring to Agni, modified by ruvaṇyúm.
Incomplete phrases straddling verse divisions are found in vss. 3–4 and 12–13
(though in those instances the complete phrase appears in the 2nd vs.); see comm.
above on vs. 3. I would thus change the text of the publ. tr. to “It is for (Kakṣīvant),
son of Uśij, to call the bellower, the ‘Laud (of Āyu)’ [=Agni], for you.” Agni can be
characterized as ‘bellowing, roaring’ because of the crackling of his flames. The
“you” are the priests (etc.) on whose behalf Kakṣīvant is acting. Agni was ritually
presented in the previous hemistich (4c) under a different epithet, and his “mothers”
(the kindling sticks) in 4d. A “roaring” Agni would come into being following the
kindling about to take place in 4d. An invocation to Agni’s comrades ends this verse
(5d). The context thus favors Agni.
The next problem is ghóṣeva. Ge (/WG) takes this as the fem. PN Ghoṣā, the
erstwhile spinster, found in a nearby Kakṣīvant hymn (I.117.7) where the Aśvins
bestowed a husband on her, as well as in the famous sequence of hymns X.39–41
attributed to her (with the patronymic Kākṣīvatī) and her son. Despite the close
connection of Kakṣīvant with this Ghoṣā, I doubt that she figures in the strictly
liturgical context here, and those who think she does must assume that Arjuna is the
name of her acquired husband, for which there is no evidence. I take the form rather
as the old instr. ghóṣā to the masc. common noun ghóṣa- ‘shout, cry’, though I admit
the simile seems a bit lame. Re’s grammatical interpr. is the same as mine; his tr.
“semblable à une rumeur (de guerre)” is less lame, but even less supported.
náṃśé occurs twice in the RV, here and in 12b in this hymn, both times
preceded by a genitive. There seems no reason not to take it, with Gr etc., as the loc.
sg. to a stem náṃśa- ‘at/on the attainment’ construed with the gen. As for árjunasya,
lit. ‘silver(y)’, I suggest that it refers to soma; cf. ṛjīṣín- ‘possessing the silvery drink
[=soma]’ (so Thieme), with the Caland form ṛji- to this same etymon. Unfortunately
árjuna- doesn’t elsewhere characterize soma. Nonetheless, the fact that the other
occurrence of náṃśe (12b) takes a genitive that also probably refers to soma gives
some support to this interpr.
The initial prá in c, echoing those in 1a and 4c, suggests that this hemistich
has a structure parallel to those two. Hence my “(put him) forward”; other tr. supply
other material to complete the clause. The meter of this pāda is deficient, lacking
three syllables. Various restorations have been suggested (see Old, Prol. 113 n. 1
[=Engl. tr. 133 n. 3]; HvN metrical notes ad loc.). Old (Prol.) suggests an impv. like
arcata or gāyata, noting the structural similarity to 4c, but in the Noten he suggests
that the metrical irregularity of Kakṣīvant’s I.120 might indicate that the text here is
correctly transmitted and that the meter must be taken as is. It is certainly difficult to
see how a trisyllabic verb form would have simply got dropped here.
I do not understand how Pūṣan comes to be named in this august divine
company, and I wonder if the abbreviated meter of this pāda has something to do
with the dedicand: the only hymns addressed solely to Pūṣan in the RV, VI.53–58,
consist entirely of dimeter hymns save for the last. The 8-syllable pāda here might
signal his more humble stature.
vasútāti- is another word that occurs in the RV only here and in vs. 12 of this
same hymn. Its formation is of course transparent, but its meaning is less so. Most
take it as a true abstract to vásu- ‘good(s)’, but with a slight twist to ‘generosity’
(Freigebigkeit). But the lexeme ácha √vac seems to be a technical ritual term for
‘invite’ (cf. áchokti- and the later priestly title acchāvāka-) with gods as the object.
Gr suggests the meaning ‘Schaar der Guten, d.h. der Götter’ for the occurrence in vs.
12 (but not this one), which I have adopted for both instances. It would be equiv. to
devátāti- ‘assemblage/conclave of gods’. The pāda would then refer to the group of
divinities that Agni regularly conveys to the sacrifice.</p>
<h3 id="i1226">I.122.6</h3>
<p>This last verse before the dānastuti is free of the manifold difficulties that
clot the first five verses of the hymn, but it is not devoid of Kakṣīvant’s poetic
flourishes. Note first the play on √śru ‘hear’, which reaches a climax in pāda c: śrótu
naḥ śróturatiḥ suśrotuḥ. What is particularly clever here is that though the pāda
contains three forms śrótu, the first is completely different from the second two: it is
the 3rd sg. act. root aor. impv., while the other two belong to the nominal stem śrótuand are 1st and 2nd compound members respectively. The pāda has only 10 syllables,
with a likely rest after śrótu naḥ, which would call attention to the phonological
identity / morphological difference.
The phrase viśvátaḥ sīm occurs 5x in the RV; I have discussed this formula at
length elsewhere (“Rigvedic viśvátaḥ sīm, or why syntax needs poetics”, Mír Curad,
Fs. C. Watkins [edd. J. Jasanoff, H.C. Melchert, and L. Oliver], 1998, pp. 291-300).
The two occurrences in Kakṣīvant’s oeuvre (I.116.20 and here) ring changes on the
basic formula in his usual deft and unexpected ways. I will not reproduce the entire
discussion, but summarize the main points. Four of the five passages (all but this
one) concern the theme “surrounding,” marked by pári + VERB. In three of these (all
but the two Kakṣīvant examples) the object is the two worlds / heaven and earth. In</p>
<h3 id="i11620">I.116.20</h3>
<p>it is the subject (the Aśvins), not the object, that is dual. In other words,
Kakṣīvant has transformed the underlying formula by transferring the abstract
grammatical category DUAL from one of the arguments of the verb to the other.
This analysis of I.116.20 is necessary to understand the more attenuated &ndash; and
more radical &ndash; instantiation of the formula found in our verse here. As in I.116.20
the DUAL that is inherent in the formula surfaces on the subject, here Mitra and
Varuṇa, but the “surrounding” motif is not present, except in viśvátaḥ ‘on all sides’
itself, which seems to have no semantic connection with the rest of its clause. Why is
it here? Because it is crossed with a different formula through surface phonological
similarity. Consider the word sádane in the same pāda, which has connections with
another RVic formula. The phrase “in the seat of Vivasvant” occurs five times in the
RV (I.53.1, III.34.7, III.51.3, X.12.7, X.75.1), twice as pāda-final sádane vivásvataḥ#
(I.53.1, X.75.1). This provides an almost perfect phonological scrambling of our
pāda ending.(In fact, according to Oldenberg [Noten, ad loc.], Ludwig suggested
emending viśvátaḥ to vivasvataḥ [no accent given].)
sádane vivásvataḥ#
sádane viśvátaḥ sīm#
Thus our phrase may have been employed in order to evoke the other formula, which
is a kenning for “der Opferplatz,&quot; so Geldner ad I.53.1. Thus Kakṣīvant deftly
marries the grammatical deep structure (the dual) of the viśvátaḥ sīm formula with
the surface phonology of sádane vivásvataḥ in a way that allows the semantics of
both to be alluded to. (Perhaps an appreciation of the formulaic manipulations
involved here would have led Bloomfield (RR) to reconsider his assessment of this
verse with its “hysterical repetition of the root śru” as “secondary clap-trap.”)
I do not understand why the Sindhu is esp. gifted with hearing.</p>
<h3 id="i1227">I.122.7</h3>
<p>The transition between the All God portion of the hymn and the dānastuti is
eased by verbal repetition: Mitra and Varuṇa, who were the last gods invoked (6ab),
are again called on here, though in opposite order and not in a dvandva but in
individual vocatives (varuṇa mitra versus 6a mitrāvaruṇā). Independent rātíḥ picks
up the 2nd cmpd member in śrótu-rātiḥ (6c) and the PN śrutáratha- (7c) also echoes
śrótu-rātiḥ.
The locc. pajré / śrutárathe priyárathe mark these men as givers, which
makes some trouble, since Kakṣīvant’s family seems to be called Pajra (quite
possibly in the next verse and in I.126.4–5) and Kakṣīvant himself pajriyá- (I.116.7,
117.6, 120.5). Nonetheless, grammar can’t be gainsaid, and they must be patrons
here. See Ge’s n. 7bc for attempts to reconcile the discrepancies.
I.122.7–8: The passively used 3rd sg. stuṣé (7a), stuṣe (8a) contrast in function with
the great majority of stuṣé / stuṣe forms, which are 1st sg. and “active” in sense (“I
(will) praise”). This rare usage may be mediated through the perception of the
accented forms as infinitives; see disc. ad X.22.1.</p>

clearly connecting it with dáṃsas- ‘wondrous power’, etc.; my tr. makes the same
connection. The stem dáṃsu- is probably also found in dáṃsu-patni- (IV.19.7),
though this is disputed. WG tr. dáṃsujūta- “als Heimkehrer,” with the 1st member
the loc. pl. of dám- ‘house’ &ndash; so, more literally, ‘in die Häuser eilend’. This is clever,
and the two independent uses of dáṃsu, both nearby (I.134.4, 141.4), do seem to be
that loc. pl. However, jūta- means ‘sped, spurred on’ and the fairly numerous
compds in which it occurs have a 1st member that provides impetus (cf., e.g., vā́tajūta- ‘wind-sped’); ‘sped into the house’ sounds more like an act of cowardice or
retreat than of triumph.
bāḷhasṛ́tvā in c is even more problematic (though Ge does tr. it: “geht er [yāti]
festes Ganges”). Independent sṛ̥́tvan- means ‘running, streaming’; bāḷha- means
‘thick, squeezed’, to √baṃh. Although it would of course be possible to attenuate
that meaning to ‘firm, powerful’, I think that Kakṣīvant, by using this unusual
compound, and esp. the unusual 1st member, had something more precise in mind
than a firm stride &ndash; esp. in a dānastuti, where slang is most at home. I have therefore
used the Engl. idiom ‘pumped up’ (approximating the ‘squeezed, dense’ sense of the
Skt.), which is defined by an online dict. (<a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com">http://www.thefreedictionary.com</a>) as
“tense with excitement and enthusiasm as from a rush of adrenaline,” with the
following example: &ldquo;we were really pumped up for the race.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="i12211">I.122.11</h3>
<p>The dual part. gmántā of pāda a does not match the pl. impv. śrótā of b nor
the pl. voc. rājānaḥ in the same pāda. Drawing the distinction did not seem worth it
in the publ. tr. &ndash; which would have to be something like “as you two go …, (do all of
you) hear …” The number discrepancy is generally (and in my opinion correctly)
interpreted as first a reference to Mitra and Varuṇa and then to the Ādityas as a
group. M+V were prominent earlier (vss. 6–7, 9; see also 15c, the final vs.) and in
fact in vs. 7 ushered in the dānastuti. The plural phrase in b is used precisely of the
three principal Ādityas, including explicitly M+V, in X.93.5: té ghā rā́jāno amṛ́tasya
mandrā́, aryamā́mitró váruṇaḥ …
This parallel also shows that Scar’s clever idea (171, followed by WG) to
construe amṛ́tasya with the verb śrótā cannot be correct.
In c Old takes the hapaxes nabhojū́- and niravá- in full lexical value, rather
than as PN, and, at least acdg. to Mayr. (PN, svv.), this remains a live possibility.
However, in the dānastuti context names are more likely, though they can be
speaking names. That -jū- echoes -jūta- in 10a and -ravá- echoes ruvaṇyú- in 5a
(assuming an analysis ni-ravá- with Old, rather than nir-avá- with Gr) is presumably
no accident: puns on personal names are a standard RVic poetic device.</p>
<h3 id="i12212">I.122.12</h3>
<p>My interpr. differs from most (though it is closest to Old’s). There are two
major reasons for the different interpr. in pāda a: 1) most take dhāma as part of the
rel. cl., but this is impossible because the verb is unaccented; 2) most take śárdham
as a reference to the Marut troop. This is, of course, its standard use, but in this hymn
it should first be interpreted in conjunction with śárdhastara- ‘more forceful’ in 10b,
where it qualifies an unnamed patron. Here we want to establish our patron (sūrí-) as
such a force. In my interpr. the rel. cl. is a nominal cl. consisting only of yásya sūréḥ,
in which *vayám (or *smás[i]) can be supplied (from the 1st pl. inherent in dhāma), as
an expression of possession: “of which patron (we) [are],” i.e., “who is (our) patron.”
Cf. the type VIII.92.32 tvám asmā́kaṃ táva smasi “you are ours; we are yours.”
The speakers in b are the poet(s) and priest(s). The gen. dáśastayasya ‘tenfold’
must be interpreted in light of the fuller expression dáśastayasya dhāséḥ in 13a
“tenfold gush,” probably a kenning for soma, though there is no agreement on its
sense. The fact that the fuller expression serves as a complement of the verb
mándāmahe, a standard soma verb, in 13a supports this identification. The ‘tenfold’
characterization is not clear; Old plausibly suggests that it refers to the number of
servings to be divided among that number of priests.
Ge (/WG) and possibly Re take cd as a resumption of the direct speech of
pāda a. This is not impossible, but the 3rd persons of c and d have no clear referents
in a.
I take dyumnā́ni in c as a fronted object of sanvantu in d, more or less
following Old. This technically makes yéṣu … rārán appear to be an embedded rel.
cl., which I’m afraid I will just have to live with.
As indicated in the comm. to vs. 5, I take vasútāti- here as a reference to the
collectivity of good ones, namely gods. I then take the pl. víśve opening the next pāda
as referring also to the gods. In this Viśve Devāḥ hymn, the poet cleverly makes
reference to them here in this off-kilter expression, with devā́ḥ suppressed and
anticipated by the sg. vasútāti-. (The full expression is found in 3d.) My only
reservation about this interpr. is that in a dānastuti it should be mortals who are doing
the winning, and certainly the phrase prabhṛthéśu vā́jam “the victory prize in the
forays” fits a mortal context better. I might then modify my tr. to remove the
bracketed “[=gods]” and leave the identity of the subject open. It may in fact be that
the two objects dyumnā́ni and vā́jam will be won by gods and mortals respectively,
and víśve refers to both, hence “let all (the gods) win the brilliant things in which the
assemblage of good ones takes pleasure, and let all (the mortals) win the victory
prize at the forays.”</p>
<h3 id="i12213">I.122.13</h3>
<p>On the phrasal repair of 12b dáśatayasya by dáśastayasya dhāséḥ see
comm. vss. 3, 5, and 12.
The “twice five” in pāda b may be the fingers, as I suggest (almost the default
identification in a RVic ritual context), or the number of priests, indirectly conveyed
by the tenfold soma of 12b and 13a. Ge (/WG) takes the “twice five” as directly
characterizing ánnā: the twice five foods.
Ge (/WG) and Re take iṣṭā́śvaḥ and iṣṭáraśmiḥ as PNs of patrons. (Actually
Re omits the first, presumably inadvertently.) I also take them as referring to patrons
but with full lexical value: the one who has “desirable horses” and “desirable reins”
[latter probably a stand-in for “chariots”] to offer. That “those showing mastery”
(īśānā́saḥ) are patrons is strongly suggested by I.141.3, where that participle
modifies sūráyaḥ ‘patrons’. The Saṃhitā text táruṣa is analyzed by the Pp. as táruṣaḥ,
which could be a gen. with īśānā́saḥ (so Gr, Re, WG) or nom. pl. (so Ge). Old
suggests that it could also be read as dat. táruṣe, against the Pp., which is how I take
it. I then interpr. nṝ́n as referring not to the singers (so Ge et al.) but to still other
patrons with whom they are competing to provide the best recompense to the singers.</p>
<h3 id="i12214">I.122.14</h3>
<p>As is recognized by all, the flood (árṇaḥ) is the herd of gift cows, whose
constant turbulent motion must have suggested the metaphor. Accentless maṇigrīvam
Old considers a “monstrosity” due to faulty transmission. It must be a bahuvrīhi like
immediately preceding híraṇyakarṇam, and I now wonder if the phrase
híraṇyakarṇam maṇigrīvam actually represents a dvandva consisting of two
bahuvrīhis (‘possessing golden ears and ornamented necks’), which could account
for the single accent. The geminate m across the compound boundary (-karṇam
maṇi-) might have been redactionally introduced from *-karṇa-maṇi-). The first
members of the two compounds híraṇya- and maṇi- are the constituents of the phrase
híraṇyena maṇínā in I.33.8, on which see my extensive discussion in “A Golden
Amulet in Vedic and Avestan” (Ged. H. P. Schmidt).
Pāda b is repeated verbatim from 3d, but because it has an object (the flood) it
has a slightly different sense from there.
The reason for the doubled ā́in c is not clear to me.
cākantu is taken, plausibly, as haplologized from *cākanantu. See, most
recently, Kü (131).</p>

<h3 id="i123">I.123</h3>
<p>Dawn
After the almost impenetrable last two hymns, the Dawn series comes as a
welcome relief, though it does not lack puzzles or Kakṣīvant’s characteristic
flourishes. Note also the prevalence of āmreḍitas and similar expressions (gr̥háṃgrham ̥ , divé-dive, śáśvat, and ágram-agram all in vs. 4; then ékaikā in 8 at long
remove, bhadrám-bhadram in 13).</p>
<h3 id="i1231">I.123.1</h3>
<p>Against the Pp (and standard tr.) I read dat. dákṣiṇāyāi rather than gen. -āyāḥ.
If it’s a gen., it has to be construed with ráthaḥ “the chariot of the priestly gift.” The
identification of the chariot and the dakṣiṇā in 5d supports neither of these interpr.</p>
<h3 id="i1232">I.123.2</h3>
<p>The vs. begins and ends with pū́rva- (pū́rvā … pūrvá(hūtau)), a very tight
species of ring composition.
punarbhū́- here seems to lack its later technical sense (a remarried widow)
and have only its literal meaning ‘come into being again’.</p>
<h3 id="i1234">I.123.4</h3>
<p>The hapax ahanā́is difficult. Gr connects it with (áhar /) áhan- ‘day’. Ge tr.
‘unverwüstliche’ (indestructible); he does not comment, but judging from the tr. I
assume he takes it from a negated derivative of √han ‘smite’. Old tentatively
suggests a connection with √ah ‘say’, though he doesn’t gloss the result (for perhaps
obvious reasons). Re ‘lascive’ with caution, connecting it possibly with āhanás-
‘swollen, lusty’ (usually of soma). WG refuse to tr. but suggest in the n. an adverbial
derivation of the particle áha ‘certainly’. My tr. rests on the possibility that it
represents *máhanā, with the initial m lost after the final m of the preceding word:
gṛháṃ-gṛham ahanā́… This would make for better meter; otherwise there are four
consecutive light syllables, spanning the (early) caesura, and Arnold (194) deems × –
⏑ ⏑ an “occasional” (that is, relatively rare) pattern of the trimeter opening. But what
would such *mahanā́represent? I suggest that it should be grouped with the
trisyllabic form mah·nā́(IV.2.1, X.6.7 [possibly; see comm. ad loc.]); this appears to
be a variant of mahinā́, the longer version of the instr. sg. to mahimán-, whose
shorter version is the very common disyllabic mahnā́. The medial -a- here would
result from matching the second vowel of mahánt-, mahá-, mahás-/máhas-, as well
as the combining form mahā-. Or it might actually reflect a different syllabification
of the inherited instr. *maǵH-mn-aH as * maǵH-m̥n-aH, with the suffixal m
vocalized between two consonants, rather than the preceding laryngeal.</p>
<h3 id="i1235">I.123.5</h3>
<p>The final phrase dákṣinayā ráthena with two instr. identifies the dakṣiṇā and
the chariot, unlike either of the proposed readings in 1a (see comm. there). Gr,
followed (perhaps surprisingly) by Old, suggests reading *dákṣiṇāyā(ḥ) here, with
the gen. supposedly found in 1a. Old ascribes the change to attraction to the instr.
ráthena. The proposed emendation would do no violence to the meter (and would in
fact produce a somewhat more common break), but since the text is easily
comprehensible as transmitted, I see no reason to emend.</p>
<h3 id="i1237">I.123.7</h3>
<p>The du. parikṣítoḥ is universally taken (Ge [/WG], Re, Old, Scar [p. 96]) as
referring to Heaven and Earth (e.g., Ge “das Dunkel der beiden umgebenden
(Welten)”). In favor of this interpr. is the fact that the two other occurrences of the
form do refer to H+E (III.7.1, X.65.8). However, I prefer to take it as referring to the
pair already in the discourse, Night and Dawn. The cycling and circling movements
of these two are highlighted in 7ab (and note pári yanti in 8d of the pl. Dawns). I also
do not understand what “the darkness of H+E” would refer to, whereas Dawn’s role
in hiding the darkness of night is well known. There is also a weak syntactic
argument in favor of my interpr. Definite anyá- forms ordinarily take 2nd position
(see Jamison 1997, Fs. Beekes); note the position of the two anyád in pāda a, each
after the fronted preverb in its clause. (The anyā́ḥ in 11d belongs to the “(all) the
other” construction, which is positioned differently.) If parikṣitóḥ is loosely
connected with what follows, anyā́here follows the first real word of the clause
támaḥ; otherwise it appears late.</p>
<h3 id="i1238">I.123.8</h3>
<p>I take pári yanti in two different senses, one with each pāda of the hemistich:
in c the verb describes the literal circuit of the thirty days whereas in d it is used in
the metaphorical sense ‘encompass’, hence ‘achieve’. The two pādas also contrast
the series of dawns needed to add up to the thirty-day cycle (c) with what each one of
them accomplishes in a single day (d).</p>
<h3 id="i1239">I.123.9</h3>
<p>I think ná in c does double duty: first and primarily as the negative with
mināti, but also as a simile marker following yóṣā. The rest of the simile (niṣkṛtám
ācárantī) follows in the next pāda. For yóṣā explicitly in a similar simile see VI.75.4
té ācárantī sámaneva yóṣā “The two …, like a maiden faring forth to (festive)
gatherings.”</p>
<h3 id="i12311">I.123.11</h3>
<p>In the publ. tr. “auspicious one” sounds like a vocative, which it is not.
Perhaps better “as the/an auspicious one.”</p>
<h3 id="i12312">I.123.12</h3>
<p>Likewise “easy to invoke,” which is not a voc. either. Better “as one easy to

<h3 id="i124">I.124</h3>
<p>Dawn
I.124.2–3: áminatī (2a) and ná … mināti (3d)(cf. also ná mināti I.123.9) receive
different tr. here both because they have different objects and because áminatī is
contrastively paired with praminatī́(2b).</p>
<h3 id="i1244">I.124.4</h3>
<p>My interpr. follows that of Thieme (KZ 79 [1965] &ndash; KlSch 214–27), cited
also in the publ. intro.; for doubts, esp. about the interpr. of pāda b, see Scar 272–73.</p>
<h3 id="i1245">I.124.5</h3>
<p>The hapax aptyá- is connected by Gr, Old, and, tentatively, EWA (s.v.
ánapta-) with ‘water’. Ge leaves it untr.; WG as ‘äussere’ without comment. I follow
Re’s tentative suggestion ‘inaccessible au vol’ (to √pat), with perhaps more
enthusiasm than he shows for it.</p>
<h3 id="i1247">I.124.7</h3>
<p>On the female figures here, see publ. intro. Though most interpr. (see
recently Scar [463], WG) see only a male figure in the simile in b (a charioteer
seeking prizes), I find it unlikely that the middle simile of three, the two outer of
which depict striking female types, would compare Dawn only to a male. As
indicated in the publ. intro., I think it is a double entendre, with not only the prizeseeking male competitor on his chariot seat but also a prostitute displaying herself on
a platform or stage for money (or whatever counted for money in that period).
I.124.7–8: suvā́śā(ḥ) in 7c is neatly echoed by svásā opening 8a.</p>
<h3 id="i1248">I.124.8</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., I believe that this verse continues the series
of female portraits, this time with two vignettes of the svayaṃvara (‘self-choice’)
marriage.
On the basis of I.113.1, Ge suggests persuasively that the subj. of pāda a is
Night and her older sister is Dawn. Nonetheless, I take the subj. of b to be Dawn,
who is going away from Night. The crucial word in b is praticákṣyă/ā (latter Pp.),
which can be either a gerund (-ă) or a gerundive (-ā). Most (though not Old) take it
as the latter, as I do, but with the sense “to be seen again” (e.g., Ge “die man
wiedersehen soll”), that is, as one who will return. But this is not the standard
meaning of práti √cakṣ, which simply means ‘gaze upon’. Here I think “to be gazed
upon” represents the display motif of the svayaṃvara marriage: before the girl
exercises her choice among the assembled suitors, she enters the arena (vel sim.) and
is announced and displayed for all to see (for disc. see esp. Jamison 1999 [Penelope]
and for this passage in general Jamison 2003 [Fs. H.-P. Schmidt], pp. 42–44).
The choosing maidens (vrā́ḥ) of the same marriage type are the topic of pāda
d.</p>
<h3 id="i12412">I.124.12</h3>
<p>The “one being at home” (amā́sánt-) may contrast implicitly with the
“Early-coming” one (prātarítvan-) who forms the subject of the 1st half of the next
hymn (I.125). In that hymn the Prātaritvan engages in dialogue with a person who is
probably a householder, that is, in the words of our verse, one being at home.
This vs. is identical to VI.64.6; for further comm. see there.</p>

<h3 id="i1252">I.125.2</h3>
<p>The first three pādas of this verse are in the standard high Rigvedic register
and present the unsurprising themes of prosperity and reciprocity, but the fourth pāda
violently wrenches the verse in an unexpected direction. The placidly happy
relationship between host and guest depicted in vss. 1 and 2abc takes a sinister and
coercive turn, but what precisely that turn consists of is partly obscured by the fact
that pāda d contains two hapaxes (mukṣī́jā- and pádi-) and a very rare lexeme (úd
√sā/si, otherwise only AV VI.112.2–3). What is clear is that the host derives great
benefit from the visit of the early-coming one if he forces him to stay &ndash; “ties him up”
in fact.
A simile adds precision to this picture, or it would if we understood it:
mukṣī́jayeva pádim “(binds you up) like a pádi with a mukṣī́jā-.” Ge tr. “wie den
Vogel in der Schlinge,” which certainly yields sense though it is essentially
contextually inspired guesswork. (In content it is reminiscent of the clearer III.45.1
“Let no one hold you down, as men using snares do a bird.”) I have tried pushing it
further, though with no confidence in the correctness of my speculations.
I treated mukṣī́jā- elsewhere (Ged. Cowgill, 1987, pp. 89–91). I suggested
there that the word is a deformation of muṣká- ‘testicle’ and that Kakṣīvant is making
a play on his own name (which may itself mean ‘having a crotch’), esp. the -kṣī, with
this deformation &ndash; as he does elsewhere in his oeuvre. Taking this further, the -jāmay be the root noun to √jani
, a root noun very common as a 2nd compound member
(see the numerous exx. in Scar. 132–53). Those compounds are invariably accented
on the -jā́-; I would attribute the accent here to the poet’s play on his name kakṣī́vant-.
But what would this baroque confection mukṣī́jā- mean? If it literally means
‘originating from/at the testicles’, it could refer to a loin cloth, a strip of cloth that
covers the genitals &ndash; a thong &ndash; and as a long strip of material it could be used to bind
or tie up an animal.
My interpr. of pádi- rests on even less evidence. I suggest, very tentatively,
that it comes from a MIA form *pṛdi-, related to the Iranian forms borrowed into
Greek as πάρδαλις, etc., as well as to Skt. pṛdāku-. In earlier lit. this word was said
to mean ‘leopard, panther, tiger’ only in lexical texts, while its earlier occurrences
mean ‘spotted snake’; see EWA, KEWA s.v. Mayrhofer attributes the later lexical
meaning to borrowing from Iranian. But it clearly refers to a large wild feline in
AVP II.18.1, since it is parallel to siṃha-‘lion’ and vyāghra- ‘tiger’; see Zehnder,
Atharvaveda-Paippalāda, Buch 2, p. 59. In keeping with the racy tone in these two
hymns, it could also be a pun on √pr̥d &lsquo;fart&rsquo; (though this root is not attested in Vedic
[see EWA s.v. pard], its representation in the younger language and in Iranian, incl.
Avestan, suggests that it was known to Vedic speakers), and the desire to make the
pun would have led K. to use an otherwise obscure word for wild animal here. Given
the discrepancy in morphology (no forms of the shape *pṛdi- are attested in any
relevant language) and the chronological gap, this gossamer hypothesis probably
should be discarded &ndash; but there is nothing stronger to take its place (and it gave me
the opportunity to use the English word ‘pard’).</p>
<h3 id="i1253">I.125.3</h3>
<p>iṣṭéḥ putrám “the son of my seeking” picks up the immediately preceding
part. ichán ‘seeking’ to the same root and means essentially the product of my
successful search.
Indra is the likely recipient of the soma in c and the strengthening in d, but the
epithet kṣayádvīra- (8x) is never applied to Indra, rather usually to Rudra (5x). But
Rudra is highly unlikely to be the target here.</p>
<h3 id="i1254">I.125.4</h3>
<p>The two conjoined phrases ījānáṃ ca yakṣyámānaṃ ca (b) and pṛṇántaṃ ca
pápuriṃ ca (c) have the same referent, and their syntactic parallelism invites a
completely parallel interpretation of their verbal semantics. But the pairs are not
morphologically parallel: the first phrase consists of a perfect part. and a future part.,
the second of a present part. and a reduplicated -i-stem adj. In the publ. tr. I render
pápuri- as preterital (“who … has granted”), but following Grestenberger (JAOS
113.2 [2013]) I now see such forms as imperfectives, often with habitual or iterative
sense; unfortunately in this context the conjoined phrase then seems almost
pleonastic, though perhaps “the one who grants and keeps granting” would work.
I would also slightly alter the tr. of the phrase in b to “the one who has
sacrificed and will sacrifice,” to make the parallelism of the two phrases in bc clearer
and also to rule out a reading in which the two participles in b have different
referents.</p>
<h3 id="i1256">I.125.6</h3>
<p>The dakṣiṇā (priestly gift, more literally gift-cow) theme comes to the fore
here.
I supply ‘bounties’ (rā́dhāṃsi) with citrā́‘bright’ on the basis of the cmpd

<h3 id="i1257">I.125.7</h3>
<p>I do not entirely understand pāda c, which must contrast with d. I assume the
referents of téṣām are the generous patrons of ab, who are distinguished from the
ápṛṇantam ‘non-granter’ of d. This non-granter is to be entirely engulfed (abhí sám
√i) by śókāḥ. The stem śóka- and the various forms of the root to which it belongs
(√śuc) otherwise refers to blazing flames in the RV, but in later Skt. it has come to
mean ‘pain, affliction’. I think that both senses are present here, hence my
portmanteau tr. “flames of pain.” The flames in this pāda may help in interpreting the
previous one. One of the uses of paridhí- ‘enclosure’ is for the “enclosing sticks”
placed around the Āhavanīya fire (already X.90.15 and common in ritual lit.). If the
non-giver is being surrounded by flames in d, the givers in c deserve a different and
benign enclosure (anyáḥ … paridhíḥ … káś cid), not the paridhí- that ordinarily
surrounds the fire. Its nature remains unspecified: both the initial position of anyáand the final káś cid mark the referent as indefinite.</p>

<h3 id="i1261">I.126.1</h3>
<p>Negated ámanda- ‘not feeble’ contains the adj. manda- ‘stupid, lazy’, which
is otherwise not attested until the Up. and epic. The audience’s first interpr. of
ámandān would be as a form of √ma(n)d ‘exhilarate’, though obviously manda-
‘stupid’ must have existed in everyday speech to allow it to be used here. As with
śóka- in the last verse of the preceding hymn (I.125.7), Kakṣīvant is availing himself
of words/meanings belonging to a different register to spice up the discourse. The
prominent placing of ámandān as the initial word of the hymn calls further attention
to this stylistic departure.</p>
<h3 id="i1262">I.126.2</h3>
<p>The root √nādh ‘(cry/be) in distress’ is often used of people in dire straits
(see, e.g., in Kakṣīvant’s I.118.10); here the king’s distress comes not from danger
but from want of fame. There may be a touch of humor in this overdramatization of
his plight, though see I.110.5 where the Ṛbhus cry out in want at an invocation,
likewise seeking fame (śráva ichámānāḥ, exactly as in our 1d).
The patron–poet reciprocal bargain is managed with striking economy here:
the king seeks fame in 1d, the poet receives many goods in 2abc, and the desired
fame is dispatched to heaven in 2d.</p>
<h3 id="i1263">I.126.3</h3>
<p>The temporal expression abhipitvé áhnām is universally taken as a reference
to evening. In the RV dakṣiṇās are distributed at the morning sacrifice (hence their
association with Dawn), though in classical śrauta ritual the time has changed to the
midday rite. Perhaps Kakṣīvant knows an alternative practice, or he’s slyly indicating
that the largesse was so enormous that it took all day to distribute. I favor the latter.</p>
<h3 id="i1265">I.126.5</h3>
<p>Having employed a no-nonsense style in listing the gifts he acquired in vss.
2–4 (for a similar detour into straightforwardness, see the expression of his desires in
I.121.14–15), Kakṣīvant returns to his tricks in the last vss. of this hymn.
Since I discuss this verses at length in Jamison 2003 (Fs. H.-P. Schmidt) pp.
47–51, I will not repeat the details here. The first hemistich is reasonably intelligible
and continues the listing of gifts. It’s notable that the amount that Kakṣīvant managed
to acquire “for you” (vaḥ) is a small fraction of his own haul. One question is who
the “you” are: I take them as the Pajras, his kin, who cleaned up with him in 4d and
are mentioned again in 5d, though in the 3rd ps.
As I point out in the loc. cit., the elaborate simile in cd seems typed as a
wedding scene by the telling words ánasvant- ‘possessing carts’ and vrā́- ‘female
chooser’. The cart (ánas-) is the wedding vehicle par excellence and hardly appears
in the RV except in conjunction with females, particularly in marriage context, and,
as I argue in that art., vrā́- is the designation for a girl exercising her choice at a
svayaṃvara marriage. The image presented in the simile is of well-connected young
men traveling to svayaṃvaras in hopes of acquiring a bride (that is, being chosen by
a bride) of acceptable family and clan. I therefore take the vrā́ḥ phrase as acc. pl., not
nom. with most interpr. and take the simile as beginning with subándhavaḥ.</p>
<h3 id="i1266">I.126.6</h3>
<p>On the meaning ‘smell’ for the intensive jáṅgahe see Lubotsky (JAOS 117
[1997]: 562–63 [rev. of Schaeffer, Intensiv]); Griffiths and Lubotsky (JAOS 119
[1999]: 480–81). The word kaśīkā- is found only here. If it refers to a mongoose (or
perhaps the related civet cat), the naturalistic description makes sense, as Lubotsky
(JAOS 117) argues: squeezed on the back, mongooses release a musky odor. (This is
characteristic of both sexes at least of civet cats, though Lubotsky seems to think it is
only true of males mongooses.) As I have argued elsewhere (Ged. Cowgill, 1987, p.
89), this hapax may appear in this passage because Kakṣīvant is making another play
on his own name (see above, comm. I.125.2).
The second hemistich appears to be a fairly graphic depiction of sexual
intercourse and, like other such passages, is difficult to interpret because of the
obscurity of the vocabulary and the slangy style. The difficulties here reside
primarily in the hapax yā́durī and the near hapax yā́śu-. The rest &ndash; dádāti máhyam …
bhojyā̀śatā́&ndash; is relatively straightforward: “She gives me 100 …” I differ from the
standard tr. in taking bhojyā̀not as acc. pl. neut. ‘pleasures’, but as a fem. sg.
gerundive. Although we would expect the accentuation *bhójyā, the suffixal accent
here may be a redactional change to follow bhojyā̀in nearby I.128.5 after our
passage was no longer understood. I take this gerundive as belonging to both roots
√bhuj ‘enjoy’ and ‘bend, coil’: the woman in question is to be coiled around (in sex)
and thus to be enjoyed.
As for yā́śu- this word appears a few other times in compounds:
budbudáyāśu- (X.155.4), where it seems to refer to ejaculations (as insubstantial as)
bubbles; fem. suyā́śutarā (X.86.6), where Indrāṇī boasts about herself &ndash; I tr. “gives
better sex” &ndash; and ayāśú- (AV VIII.6.15) as an epithet of hideous minor demons
tormenting pregnant women, where Whitney plausibly but tentatively tr. ‘impotent’.
I take it to mean something like ‘ejaculation’, which I’ve rendered as ‘spurts’ to
avoid a clinical tone.
yā́durī- appears to belong to the marginal root √yād ‘unite’ (see EWA s.v.
YĀD); I render the nominal here by ‘fusing’.
As often, I think the presence of these rare words serves more than one
purpose — in this case to produce an encoded pun on the root √yabh ‘fuck’. Note the
repetition of yā’s, starting with yā́in b, but taking off in cd: … (mah)ya yā́(durī)
yā́(śūnāṃ bhojí)yā … This repetition of the initial of the root might have the same
effect as the English expression “the f-word,” and it also gives the impression of a
stutterer saying “ya … ya … ya …” while the bh eludes him &ndash; until he reaches
bh(ojyā̀) and finally achieves the whole word.</p>
<h3 id="i1267">I.126.7</h3>
<p>This is presumably the speech of the woman whose charms were described
in vs. 6. I have tr. it with what I consider appropriate vulgarity.
In pāda a úpopa ‘nearer’ and párā ‘away’ might seem to be preverbs that
would cancel each other out, but here their conjunction perhaps invites the interpr.
that she&rsquo;s asking for ever more intimate contact (úpopa) with parts that are usually
off limits (párā).
Ge (/WG) take dabhrā́ṇi manyathāḥ to mean “think that (my hair) is meager”
vel sim., with the hair borrowed from the second hemistich. I think rather that
dabhrá- √man means ‘belittle, think little of’, but that dabhrā́ṇi should also be read
as the object of that compound verb. This latter dabhrā́ṇi I take as a euphemism for
her private parts (‘little things’), in the way that priyā́‘dear things’ is used by Indrāṇī
in X.86.5 to refer to the same. (The contexts &ndash; explicit female boasting about sex &ndash;
are similar, not to mention rare.) I thus take dabhrā́ṇi twice.
Although it is clear why a ewe, even a little ewe (avikā́), would be a fine
example of a hairy female, I have no idea why Gandharī ewes would be especially
hairy. Cold climate, one assumes.</p>

<p>Hymns of Paruchepa Daivodāsi
This sequence of hymns, composed primarily in Atyaṣṭi meter, is one of my
favorite collections in the RV. The elaborate meter showcases the patterned
repetitions, echoes, and variations that are one of the specialties of Rigvedic poets.
The meter is configured as 12 12 8 / 8 8 / 12 8, generally with exact repetition, rhyme,
or some kind of controlled variation between pāda b + c and f + g. This series is the
only sustained set of Atyaṣṭi hymns in the RV; to Paruchepa’s son (/descendant)
Anānata Pāruchepi is attributed the short Soma hymn IX.111.</p>

<p>Agni</p>
<h3 id="i1271">I.127.1</h3>
<p>The patterned connections of the 8-syllable pādas to their preceding pādas
are detailed in the publ. intro. to this hymn group.</p>
<h3 id="i1272">I.127.2</h3>
<p>Although “earth-encircling heaven” fits easily into our modern cosmology, I
don’t know what is meant by this in a Vedic cosmological context. This problem
clearly troubles both Ge and Re, who both supply the sun to do the circling, with
heaven as the object (Re: “Lui qui circule autour (de l’aire) comme (le soleil autour
du) ciel”). Although I understand the impetus, these interpr. introduce too much extra
machinery into a simple two-word simile.
Agni was compared to a vípra- in 1c and then addressed as one in 2b. In 2c
we invoke Agni with our own vípra-s, with víprebhiḥ occuping the same position as
vípram in 1c. This type of implicit identification between Agni and his mortal
worshipers is also found in 2a, where we sacrificers (yájamānāḥ) invoke him as best
sacrificer (yájiṣṭham).
2f is a relative clause that lacks a verb; the verb ([pra-]ávanti vel sim.) can be
supplied from the verb in the 8-syllable tag (2g), which contains the impv. prā́vantu
with the same subj. (víśaḥ ‘clans’). The g-pāda also adds an infinitival dat. to this
verbal complex, indicating what the clans help Indra to do. Constructing the verb in
2f from the one in 2g is not a matter of simple gapping, because imperatives cannot
appear in relative clauses. Ge supplies a different verb in f (huldigen) from that in g
(ermutigen), but this ignores the patterned interplay characteristic of the 8-syllable
pādas with what precedes them.</p>
<h3 id="i1273">I.127.3</h3>
<p>This verse is richly studded with problems. One of the lesser ones is the
referent and grammatical identity of purū́in the first pāda. Gr classifies it with
singular (presumably NA neut.) forms; Ge. takes it as an adv. ‘gar sehr’; WG as instr.
sg. (?) with ójasā (“mit ohnehin viel … Körperkraft”). On the basis of the sequence
(3d) vīḷú cid, (4a) dṛḷhā́cid, (4f) sthirā́cid (also with ójasā), all containing neuters,
most plural, I take purū́as the neut. pl. it appears to be (so also Re: “qui brille en
maint endroit”). Each instance of cid ‘even’ in this sequence emphasizes the
formidable targets Agni is exercising his will upon. Unfortunately this value of cid is
not so much in evidence in our phrase purū́cid … dī́dyānaḥ because ‘shining’ (at
least as expressed with the root √dī) is not ordinarily a forceful or hostile act. I have
therefore (reluctantly) not rendered the cid here, though I feel I have missed
something, since the phrasal parallelism is otherwise so clear. Perhaps dī́dyānaḥ has
something of the sense of similar forms of √śuc ‘blaze (against)’: so “shining
(against) even the many with his radiant might.”
Pāda b and its tag-pāda c contains a śleṣa, whose correct interpretation goes
back at least to Benfey (see Ge’s n. 3c). As indicated in the publ. intro. to I.127-139,
druhaṃtaráḥ has two possible analyses: druhaṃ-tará- ‘overcoming deceit’ or druhantara- ‘better at striking wood’. The first is appropriate to the first instance of the
word, but in c the presence of paraśúḥ ‘ax’ forces the ‘wood’ interpr.
The verb of de, śrúvat, is the problem in that clause. Wh (Roots) takes it as a
(zero-grade) 1st class pres. to √sru ‘flow’, but √sru has no such zero-gr. formations
(and there’s the problem of the initial sibliant of course). Gr puts it with a root √śru
‘zerinnen, zergehen’ (separate from √śru ‘hear’), but the formations he assigns to
said “root” are a hodgepodge (and see Old on the likely nonexistence of the root). Re
(flg. Cardona, see Re’s n.) takes it to √śru ‘hear’, but this requires supplying the verb
of destruction (by his interpr. ‘fall’) required by the context, with the perception verb
that is actually found in the passage superfluous: “on les entend (tomber) …” (The
same root assignment seems to underlie the WG tr., though with a different overall
interpr., which I confess I don’t understand.) Even if the semantics worked better,
there are no such stems to √śru ‘hear’. Ge attributes it to √śṝ ‘crush’, which is
reasonable on both semantic and textual grounds; see esp. the parallel he cites X.89.6
śṛṇā́ti vīḷú rujáti sthirā́ṇi, with very similar phraseology. Unfortunately I can see no
way to get a stem śrúva- from śṝ. Old questioningly suggests a connection with √ru
‘break’, but needless to say the initial ś can’t simply be omitted. I dare to suggest yet
another root: √srīv ‘abort’. Although some forms of this root (caus. srevayet [KS],
RVic part. sreváyant-; aor. asrāvīt [JB]; pres. srīvyati [AB]) have an initial dental
sibilant, others have the palatal: AV śrīvayāmi, MS śrīvayeyuḥ, śrevuka-. (On the
forms, see Narten [Sig.Aor.] 282–83. Jamison [áya-] 145.) Such phonetic fluctuation
is not surprising in a root that presumably was at least partially tabooed. Although a
stem śrúva- or srúva- is not otherwise found to this root, the spotty attestation to this
root in general makes its isolation unsurprising. The stem would probably be a zerograde thematic injunctive (aor. or pres.?), though a root subjunctive can’t be ruled
out (though less likely in context). The loss of the i ̯/ i would follow the same pattern
as √dīv / d(y)ū, √sīv / s(y)ū, via *sRi ̯uH à *sRuH. I do not understand the accent,
however. As for ‘abortion’ in this context of destruction, see, inter alia, the use of the
caus. part. sreváyant- in VII.18.8, the Battle of the Ten Kings; possibly also áva √sru
in nearby I.129.6.
The final two pādas (fg) of this verse also present their share of difficulties.
We can begin with the final word of each pāda, nā́yate in the Saṃhitā text. The Pp.
(followed by HvN) analyses this as ná ayate, but this produces a very bad cadence:
we should expect a heavy syllable as the first syllable of the verb. This is easily
remedied, without emending the Saṃhitā text, by ā́yate (i.e., prev. ā́+ ayate). This
analysis was also tentatively suggested by Gotō (1st cl., 92 n. 10).
Most tr. (and Old) take the point of yamate nā́yate to be that though Agni is
victorious, he doesn’t go further: he stays in his hearth. See, e.g., Re “'(Bien que)
triomphant, il tient (les rènes), il ne va pas (plus loin).” But the preverb níḥ ‘forth’
(with √sah only here and in the root noun niṣṣáh-) seems to presuppose motion
(hence my ‘going forth to conquer’), and certainly most treatments of Agni
victorious depict him laying waste to his surroundings, as in the immediately
preceding two pādas and in the following verse (4). The notion that Agni is suddenly
showing self-restraint here seems contrary to the message of the context. I therefore
take yamate as meaning not ‘hold himself back’, but ‘hold/keep his place’ (against
counterattack) and ā́yate (/ayate) as a quasi-passive ‘be moved’. Medial forms of √i
are rare enough that a consistent meaning to such a stem is hard to determine, and
though some forms of áyate probably belong to a thematized stem (so Gotō, 92ff.),
the parallelism with the root aor. subj. yamate here strongly suggests that our form is
also a subjunctive (to the root pres. éti) and thus further separated from the thematic
indicative forms. I therefore think that the somewhat idiosyncratic meaning I have
attributed to the form is plausible, esp. as a negated semantic twin to yamate.
The final problem in the verse is the cmpd. instr. sg. dhanvāsáhā. This is
almost universally (Gr, Old, Ge, Re, Scar 603) interpreted as ‘conquering with a bow’
(dhánvan-), which interpr. generally requires an additional personage to be supplied,
generally Rudra. Gotō (1st cl., 92, n. 10) seems to favor this interpr., but also suggests
the possibility that the first member is dhánvan- ‘Land’: “auf dem das Land
ersiegenden [Weg],” with the whole pāda meaning that Agni will not go further and
burn the land. WG have adopted this latter interpr. (though the ‘bow’ interpr. is
referred to in the n.): “Auf dem trockenen Land ersiegenden (Weg) eilt er nicht
hierher.” I am also convinced that dhánvan- ‘wasteland’ is the correct interpr. of the
1st member. Given that the ‘tree’ theme is prominent in this verse and a ‘bow’ theme
lacking, a reference to another landscape feature fits the context better. There is the
problem that cmpds with -sáh- are ordinarily adjectives modifying animates (see the
numerous exx. in Scar.), and my tr. assumes an abstract sense or at the very least an
instr. manner adverb (“in/with his wasteland-conquering [manner]”). Despite this
slight difficulty, this solution seems more economical than inserting Rudra into a
context that has no other allusion to him.
I.127.3-4: In the publ. tr. ójasā in 3a and 4f should have been tr. the same, rather than
‘might’ and ‘strength’ respectively.</p>
<h3 id="i1274">I.127.4</h3>
<p>I generate the subject “(the pious man),” i.e., dāśvā́n, from its verb dāṣṭi.</p>
<h3 id="i1275">I.127.5</h3>
<p>After the respite of vs. 4, this verse returns to puns and word plays in full
force. The syntax of this verse is complicated enough without unintended ambiguity
in the English. In the pub. tr. “This fortifying power of his might we acquire …”
‘might’ is a modal verb (“might we acquire”), not an abstract noun (*“his might”).
In my opinion the hapax dívātarāt in bc is a śleṣa somewhat like druhaṃtaráḥ
in 3bc, again utilizing the echo pāda (c) to instantiate a 2nd value for a word found in
both pādas. Most take the word as a nonce substantivization of the adverb dívā by the
addition of the comparative suffix found also in the preceding sudárśataraḥ ‘more
beautiful’ (see AiG II.2.608; Re n. ad loc.). I agree that this is one reading, but I also
think that -tara- can be a thematic nominal to √tṝ ‘cross over’ (cf. tára- etc.), and
that the whole compound can mean ‘traversing [the sky] by day’ as a descriptor of
the sun. For a similarly formed rhyme word, also referring to the sun, cf. divākará-
‘day-maker’ (AV+).
The hapax áprāyuṣe in c also poses difficulties. On the one hand, it is very
similar to áprāyu- (3x) ‘unremitting, not faltering’, which most deriv from prá √yu;
Old and Re opt for this analysis (Re “à (l’homme qui veille) infatigable”). However,
I am persuaded by Ge’s pointing out (n. 5) the unity of theme provided by áprāyuṣe
(c) … ā́yuḥ (d) … ajárāḥ (fg), if áprāyuṣe contains the ‘lifetime’ word. However, I
do not think either Ge’s “ohne zu altern” or WG’s “zum Nichtverschwinden der
Lebenskraft” is the correct analysis. Rather I think the word evokes the common
idiom ā́yuḥ pra √tṝ ‘lengthen lifetime’ and refers to a man whose lifetime has not yet
been lengthened. Note that the √tṝ part of the idiom can be pulled out of dívātara- (a
3rd sense for this compound). Agni is called viśvā́yu- ‘providing/affording all
lifetimes’ in the next hymn (I.128.8) and is also regularly asked to lengthen (prá
√tṝ ) our lifespan (e.g., I.94.16, VIII.44.30). I now also believe that áprāyu- also
contains the ‘lifetime’ word (the less well-attested ā́yu- beside ā́yus-); see comm. ad
V.80.3.
In the next pāda Agni’s own lifespan (that is, his immortality, more explicit in
fg) is a model for our own: it provides a handhold (grábhaṇavat) or, as we would say,
“a leg up” for the man hoping to have his lifespan extended.
I don’t quite understand bhaktám ábhaktaṃ vā. It is probably an implicitly
temporal expression: the help that has already been apportioned and the rest that has
not yet been apportioned (but will be, we hope).</p>
<h3 id="i1276">I.127.6</h3>
<p>The verse has an extra pāda (h), which serves as the tag-pāda to g. Given the
difficulties in the verse, the extra pāda just provides more occasion for bewilderment.
The hapax iṣṭáni- in the paired pādas bc has been variously interpreted. Gr
takes it to (n)is + √stan ‘thunder’ (‘thunder’ explicitly rejected by Old). Ge does not
comment but his tr. ‘sich ausbreitend’ suggests a derivation from √tan ‘stretch’; his
tr. is echoed by Re (‘s’étendant’), though in his n. he suggests that the first element is
the zero-grade root noun to √yaj ‘sacrifice’, encouraged by Old. The currently
prevailing interpr. is probably Hoffmann’s (reported in KEWA, EWA) ‘spreading
nourishment’, found in WG. This is certainly possible; however, I favor √stan
‘thunder’, despite Old’s disapproval, but with the preverb ví. The Saṃhitā text reads
… urvárāsviṣṭánir (b) / ā́rtanāsviṣṭániḥi (c), but both loc. plurals require metrical
distraction: urvárās
u
viṣṭánir (etc.). The Pp. reads urvárāsu / iṣtániḥ (etc.), but nothing
prevents reading urvárāsu / viṣtániḥ from the distracted -s(u)vi- sequence. Although
vi √stan is not found until very late, it would not be a difficult idiom to create, esp.
given the widespread ví √dyut ‘flash forth as lightning’ in the same pragmatic sphere.
The thunder would thematically continue the noise of the first pāda and the
association with the Maruts, storm gods.
Pāda c contains a 2nd hapax, ā́rtanāsu, which both Ge and WG refuse to tr.
(though see WG n. for a different suggestion) and Old, having offered a few
suggestions, refuses to analyze. Re tr. “les terres steriles” but without comment
(though the tr. probably stems from Gr’s ‘übel, öde, Misernten bringend’). My own
suggestion is quite speculative, but in this situation there seems no other choice. The
pāda is a syllable short; HvN in fact divide up the first vowel, reading ā́ártanāsu, but
a stem ártanā- does us no more good than ā́rtanā-. I suggest supplying the syllable
nir to open the pāda (and the word, hence *nirā́rtanāsu); this nir can be generated
from the final syllable of the preceding pāda (iṣṭán)nir, or rather we can imagine a
haplology: iṣṭánir, *nirā́rtanāsu. This posited stem *nirā́rtanā- would belong to nír
√ṛ, most prominent in the well-attested nírṛti- ‘chaos, disorder, dissolution’. The loc.
pl. pairing in bc would then contrast the productive (ápnasvant-) fields/meadows
with their negative counterpart, disorderly and useless.
Note the alliteration in d: ā́dad dhavyā́ny ādadír, followed by ádha beginning
f (as well as ā́d beginning 5d).
As Ge points out (n. 6d), ā́dat can be the impf. to √ad ‘eat’ as well as
belonging to ā́√dā ‘take’, though he doesn’t incorporate this pun into his tr. Agni as
the eater of oblations is of course a common trope.
hárṣato hṛ́ṣīvataḥ in f is a nice etymological figure, though in the context of
this hymn barely deserving mention.
Most tr. take the náraḥ of h as ordinary, human men, but I think it refers
rather to the Maruts. śubhé (and śúbh- in general) is one of their signature words; cf.,
e.g., I.88.2 śubhé kám yānti and, with náraḥ referring to them, V.52.8 … té śubhé
náraḥ. The mention of the Maruts here would form a ring with their appearance in
pāda a.</p>
<h3 id="i1277">I.127.7</h3>
<p>Most take kīstá- in pāda as a PN, a further specification of the Bhṛgus, and
this is a tempting way to avoid dealing with the word. However, it is more difficult to
take it as a PN in its only other appearance in the RV (and indeed anywhere) at
VI.67.10. I therefore follow the interpr. going back at least to Sāy, ‘praiser’. EWA
has a reasonably plausible scenario for getting it as a hypersanskritization of a MIA
form of *kīrtha-, beside kīrtí- ‘praise’, etc.
I take mathnántaḥ in c as a pun on √math ‘steal’ (referring to the Bhṛgus’
theft of fire; see Narten, KlSch. 23-24) and ‘churn, rub’, a common word for the
production of the fire on the ritual ground.
The identity of the “dear coverings” is not clear. Ge suggest, for example, that
they are what keep Agni within the kindling sticks, WG that they are everything a
fire burning in a field would incorporate in itself. Since Agni is identified as the
holder (dharṇí-) of goods in e, I wonder if the coverings are the enclosure itself &ndash;
though what this means physically I’m not sure.
On the isolated precative vaniṣīṣṭa see Narten (SigAor. 236-37), who points
out that its object is also a hapax and considers it an “Augenblicksbildung des
Dichters.” The “wise one” (médhira-) is probably Agni himself, as often, and the
med. form of the verb would support this identification.</p>
<h3 id="i1278">I.127.8</h3>
<p>This verse begins straightforwardly enough but its syntax deteriorates (or
gets more convoluted) towards the end.
The three-member cmpd. satyágirvāhas- in c is implicitly analyzed by Ge as
satyágir-vāhas- (“ihn den wahrhafte Reden anziehen”; sim. WG), but, on the one
hand, gírvāhas- is an established bahuvrīhi (8x; “whose vehicle is songs” &ndash; that is,
the god [Indra] who is conveyed to the sacrifice by the songs dedicated to him) and,
on the other, satyá- never modifies gír- as far as I can tell. Old (SBE) tr. “who truly
art carried by prayers as by a vehicle,” with the correct internal structure, in my
opinion. My “trusty” for satyá- may be pushing the term a bit, but the idea is that the
song-vehicle is real and so a trustworthy conveyance.
The ca in f is generally rendered ‘also’, and it is one of only three examples
(out of approx. 1100) of ca to which Klein (DGRV I.212-13) attributes that value.
None of the examples is strong, and all can be interpreted with functional values
more commonly found with ca. In this case I think amī́ca víśve amṛ́tāsaḥ is
conjoined with a gapped vayám ‘we’, as in exx. like VII.88.3 ā́yád ruhā́va váruṇaś
ca nā́vam “When [I] and Varuṇa boarded the boat …,” though with pl. rather than sg.
1st ps. gapping. The 1st ps. pl. is found in the opening verb of the verse havāmahe, and
although some pādas intervene, that main verb still has domain over the whole verse
(save for the last pāda), with ef a rel. cl. attached to that main clause. True, the verb
in this rel. clause must also be supplied. I suggest a medial form of √dhā, meaning
‘acquire’; see in fact dhīmahi in this meaning in 5a &ndash; all that is needed is an accent.
For the identical VP váyas- + med. √dhā in this same hymn cycle, cf. I.136.2 áthā
dadhāte … váyaḥ “then they two [=Mitra and Varuṇa] acquire vigor,” and for a 1st pl.
in this collocation (including the instr.) see II.23.10 tváyā vayám uttamáṃ dhīmahe
váyaḥ “Through you might we acquire the utmost vigor.” In nearby I.141.13 (though
not a Paruchepa hymn) amī́ca is overtly conjoined with vayám, as I suggest is
covertly the case here: amī́ca yé maghávāno vayáṃ ca “those who are our patrons
and we (ourselves) …”
As for pāda g, which also lacks a verb, my publ. tr. assumes an active
imperatival form of the same root √dhā, addressed to Agni. Agni quite regularly
participates in such collocations; in this case the verb might well be the imperativally
used root aor. injunctive dhāḥ or else the redupl. pres. impv. dhehi. This short pāda
blends two constructions: “set oblations among LOC” and “establish vigor for DAT,”
both with √dhā. For the first, with Agni as subject, see, e.g., V.14.1 havyā́devéṣu no
dadhat; for the second, likewise with Agni as subject, see, e.g., II.4.9 smát sūríbhyo
gṛṇaté tád váyo dhāḥ “establish this vigor for the singer along with his patrons.”
Since in our passage the recipients of the váyas- have already been identified in the
previous pāda ([us] and all the immortals), the dative recipient with the second
construction need not be specified. A more literal tr. of my understanding of this
pāda might then be “(place) the oblations among the gods and (establish) vigor,” but
this seemed too clotted for the publ. tr.
The trick of this tag-pāda then is that the final ā́váyaḥ is twice the object of an
unexpressed form of the root √dhā, but with two different valences. Unusually for
tag-pādas, g is not syntactically parallel to f.</p>
<h3 id="i1279">I.127.9</h3>
<p>The hapax splv. sáhantama- does not require the positing (with Gr) of an
otherwise unattested n-stem sáhan-. A nonce derivation from the pres. part. sáhant-
(with simplification of the cluster sáhan(t)-tama-, with AiG II.2.597, etc.) is certainly
possible, and the full grade with nasal might have been constructed as a partial match
for its parallels śuṣmíntama- and dyumníntama-.
I.127.9-10: The ends of both a-pādas are variants of each other: 9a … sáhasā
sáhantamaḥ, 10a … sáhasā sáhasvate, each following a metrical rest.</p>
<h3 id="i12710">I.127.10</h3>
<p>The first three pādas are an esp. nice example of the syntactic
complementarity between the tag-pāda c and what precedes. The subject and the verb
are withheld until c (stómaḥ and babhūtu respectively), with the preverb determining
the verbal lexeme (prá) and the possessive pronoun limiting the praise (vaḥ) found in
the first pāda &ndash; and the recipient agnáye the only thing held in common between ab
and c. Thus neither ab nor c is complete in itself: their elements need to be
intermingled to produce the full sense. The name of the recipient is also held until the
end of the two-pāda opening, though prepared for by a series of datives.
Schaeffer (Inten. 114) argues persuasively that the intens. joguve is
“lokaldistributiv” with the loc. phrase víśvāsu kṣā́su “in all lands.”</p>
<h3 id="i12711">I.127.11</h3>
<p>The latter part of this verse shows a nice phonological pattern, with the
initial words in the pāda being c mahó, d máhi, f máhi, but g máthīr. The first three
all belong of course to the mah (‘great’) family, but the last is a verb form whose
apparent near match with the two preceding máhi belies its independent grammatical
identity.
There is probably also a phonological impetus for the use of sácanas- instead
of the much more common sajóṣas- in b: sácanās better matches sucetúnā.
In de most tr. (including me) take máhi … nas kṛdhi, saṃcákṣe … as an
infinitive phrase, “make us regard (something) great.” Keydana (Infin. 342) allows
this possibility, but also raises the possibility of an adjunct usage: “make something
great for us, for seeing.” Although I recognize that the latter is not excluded, I think
the infinitive reading is the more likely &ndash; on the basis of the other dative phrase in e,
bhujé asyaí. The final position of asyaí here is odd, and in fact the use of it at all is
odd, given that an unadorned bhujé ends 8b and its tag-pāda 8c. I think that we have
a demonstrative adj. with bhujé in this verse in order to anchor bhujé as a noun and to
distinguish it from the immediately preceding dative, also built to a root noun, but in
infinitival function. In other words, the asyaí serves to polarize the grammatical
functions of two identically formed nominals.
In máthīḥ I see the same pun on the two roots √math as was found in 7c. Here
the plundering sense is appropriate to the simile ugró ná śávasā “like a mighty
(warrior) with vast power,” while the churn sense is attached to Agni as fire the
substance. Although the ritual fire is churned (passively), we can imagine Agni using
the same means that produced him (churning) to produce something for us. (So,
more or less, Ge.) Narten (KlSch 24; followed apparently by WG) feels that máthīḥ
here can only have the ‘rob’ sense, because only fire can be the obj. of the ‘churn’
sense, but this opinion displays, at least in my view, the often deficient poetic and
imaginative sense of the Erlangen school.</p>

<p>The phrase mánuṣo dhárīmaṇi is variously rendered. Re takes it as an
infinitive (“pour être porté par l’Homme”); Gr and Old (SBE) interpret it in an
abstract or ethical fashion (“nach altem Brauch”; “in Manu’s firm law”; sim.
Brereton in his survey of dhárman-). Hoffmann (Inj. 121, fld by WG) as ‘hands’. But
given the emphasis in the verse on the activity on the ritual ground (bc) and indeed
the fire’s placement on said ground (fg), Ge’s “im (Feuer)behälter des Manu” seems
the most likely interpr. &ndash; rendered by me as “the foundation of Manu,” making
reference to the fact that Manu was the first sacrificer and so every subsequent ritual
ground can be ascribed to him. See 7a mā́nuṣe vṛjáne ‘in the ritual enclosure
belonging to Manu’ for another association between Manu and a physical location on
the ritual ground.
As usual the line between human priests and Agni as priest is blurred in bc.
Agni is regularly identified as an uśíj- (I.60.4, etc.) but uśíjaḥ in the plural are
humans.
“In the footprint of refreshment” (iḷás padé) is a standard kenning for the
ritual ground or, more narrowly, the place where oblations are offered; a similar
expression is found in Old Avestan, at Y. 50.8.</p>
<h3 id="i1282">I.128.2</h3>
<p>My interpr. of ápi √vat roughly follows Tichy’s (Die Spr. 26 [1980]: 3–5,
esp. n. 8 [= KlSch 108–10]) ‘mit etw. (Akk.) bekannt, vertaut sein’ (contra Thieme’s
Fs. Weller)—though perhaps with a bit more oomph.
I construe ṛtásya pathā́in b with yajñasā́dham in a, flg. Lü (Var. 463) &ndash;
contra most interpr., who take it as roughly parallel to the other instr. expressions in
b. It is true that there is some distance between the two expressions I put together,
and Ge also cites two parallels where ṛtásya pathā́is adjacent to námasā. However,
in both those instances the two instrumentals are better taken with different parts of
the verse, and since Lü’s interpr. yields richer sense, I maintain it here.</p>
<h3 id="i1283">I.128.3</h3>
<p>The standard tr. (as well as Scar. 110-11) take -gír- in muhurgī́r to √gṝ
‘sing’, rather than, with Gr, to √gṝ ‘swallow’. This is certainly possible, though
“‘plötzlich, augenblichlich willkommen geheissen’ (?)” (Scar 110; sim. WG) does
not have much to do with what proceeds or follows in the verse. I prefer to keep Gr’s
‘auf einmal verschlingend’. The expression completes the description of Agni’s
journey in the preceding pāda. The speed of his journey around the world, completed
in a single day, is conveyed by the image of “swallowing up” the route instantly &ndash;
similar expressions are found in English. EWA (s.vv. GARI1
, GARI2
) is uncertain of
the root affiliation.</p>
<h3 id="i1284">I.128.4</h3>
<p>The part. iṣūyánt- in d is generally tr. ‘shooting arrows’ (though cf. Re’s
“qui cherche la jouissance-rituelle”; sim. Old SBE [but not Noten]), but shooting
arrows seems out of place in this context, even with Ge’s suggestion (n. 4d) that the
priest is compared to a shooter because his words are arrows. Although I maintain
the connection with ‘arrow’, I think it means simply ‘go (straight) like an arrow’,
readily translatable into the English idiom ‘straight-arrow’, namely a person of
utmost rectitude.</p>
<h3 id="i1285">I.128.5</h3>
<p>A complex vs., esp. in its earlier parts, with a variety of tr. I will treat only
my own. But first a few textual adjustments. In b I read (with most interpr., going
back to Ludwig; see Old and Ge’s n. 5b) agné ráveṇa rather than Pp. agnér áveṇa.
Note also that the sandhi between b and c has been wrongly resolved by HvN into
bhojíye / a… rather than bhojíyā / i… (here Pp. is correct). And the first word of c
has the wrong sibilant in the HvN text: it’s correctly iṣirā́ya, not iśirā́ya.
Also in b I take the simile as consisting only of marútāṃ ná rather than
including bhojyā̀. This genitive modifies ráveṇa and is parallel to agné(r). The
roaring of Agni is being compared to the roaring of the Maruts, personifications of
the thunderstorm. This syntactic distribution is found in Old SBE, but subsequent tr.
have not followed him.
I take the bhojyā̀as nominative and the subject of an intrans./passive use of
med. pṛñcáte, a usage found elsewhere. However, it is not impossible that this med.
form is transitive &ndash; cf. ā́… pṛcīmahi in the next hymn (I.129.7) &ndash; in which case I
would supply ‘priests’ as subj.: “(The priests) infuse the (offering-)foods into his
forces.”
In pāda a I take táviṣīṣu ‘forces’ as a reference to Agni’s flames. Although
táviṣī- ordinarily belong to Indra, see, e.g., III.3.5, 26.4 for táviṣībhiḥ in conjunction
with Agni.
I tentatively take Indra as the referent for iṣirā́ya in c, as he is addressed as
iṣira in the first vs. of the next hymn (I.129.1) and is several times the referent of this
stem elsewhere. But I do not insist on this identification.
The ca in de is problematic, and this problem is connected with the question
of the affiliation of vásūnām. Ge (fld. by Klein, DGRV I.234) takes ca as a clausal
conjunction and supplies a 2nd verb “(beschenkt)” in d, parallel to ínvati in c. This
requires that vásūnām be construed with majmánā (“mit einer Fülle von Gütern”).
But majmánā does not take a genitive of specification but only of possession and in
any case its contexts favor ‘might’ over ‘abundance’. Several times it appears
parallel with krátvā (including nearby I.141.6, 143.2) in the collocation “with resolve
and with might,” as it would here, though at some remove (see krátvā in pāda a).
Forms of vásu- regularly occur with forms of √dā ‘give’, however, and so the most
natural collocation here would be dā́nam … vásūnām “the giving of goods.” But
what, then, to do with the ca? I think the clue is to be found in X.50.7 vásūnāṃ ca
vásunaś ca dāváne “for the giving of goods and of good”; in other words, I think the
vásūnāṃ ca in our passage is a truncated formula, with vásunaś ca gapped. But the
omitted sg. vásu- is immediately inserted in the first pāda of the next verse (6a) and
the number-neutralized stem occurs three times in vs. 8: vásudhitim (8a), vasūyávaḥ
(8f, g). Note also that a different form of vásu appears to be gapped in 6ab. The poet
slyly sets the vásu- agenda in 5de by introducing it with an off-balance expression
that requires repair. For a similarly problematic ca involving (in my opinion)
gapping, see the previous hymn, I.127.8 and disc. there.
The phrase śáṃsād aghā́t corresponds to the well-attested bahuvrīhi
agháśaṃsa- ‘possessing evil speech’, found in the next hymn (I.129.6).</p>
<h3 id="i1286">I.128.6</h3>
<p>With Ge, Re, and Old I supply an acc. pl. vásū(ni) as obj. of dadhe, on the
basis of IX.18.4 vásūni hástayor dadhé (cf. also X.54.5). The gapping of a form of
vásu- here, accepted by most, corresponds nicely to the gapping of the same stem I
suggest for the previous vs. Thieme (Unters.), fld. by WG, instead take dadhe as
passive: the fire “is taken in the hand” (of the priest, so Th). This seems
pragmatically unlikely: although firebrands are ritually carried about under certain
circumstances, picking up the entire ritual fire (as víhāyāḥ and aratíḥ seem to imply)
would be risky and painful. Moreover, the rest of the verse depicts the good things
that Agni does for people, and taking goods in his hand fits this context.
The rarely attested verbal stem iṣudhyá-, here in the part. iṣudhyaté, has a
counterpart in Old Avestan, išūidiiāmahī 3x in the Yasna Haptaŋhāiti, which exists
alongside a noun išud-. The form is carefully discussed by Narten (YH 159-61), who
accepts Humbach’s etymology (Gathas 1959, II, ad Y 31.14; repeated 2nd ed. 1991):
išud- is a compound of iš- ‘nourishment’ and the zero-grade of *√vadh ‘lead’, to
which root noun compound a denom. is built meaning ‘strengthen’. (For a rehearsal
of the history of this scholarship, see Scar 63.) I am not convinced. I prefer to see it
(couched in Vedic terms for the moment) as a compound of íṣu- ‘arrow’ and √dhā
‘place’. That lexeme is specialized in the meaning ‘aim’ and is a well-attested
metaphor for the “aiming” of a praise-hymn towards the divine recipient; cf. IX.69.1
íṣur ná dhánvan práti dhīyate matíḥ “Like an arrow on a bow, my thought is aimed.”
(For the affinity of íṣu- and √dhā cf. also I.64.10 ástāra íṣuṃ dadhire gábhastayoḥ
“The archers have taken their arrows in their fists” and the cmpd. iṣu-dhí- ‘quiver’.)
Such an analysis works also for the Avestan forms, since Avestan has both the
‘arrow’ word and the verb, and I see no reason why it could not be reconstructed for
Indo-Iranian. An ‘arrow’ derivation works extremely well in our passage because
iṣudhyaté echoes iṣūyaté (‘going straight like an arrow’) in vs. 4, likewise ending the
d-pāda, likewise a denominative participial dat. of benefit. For extensive and updated
disc. see my forthcoming “Vedic iṣudhyá- and Old Avestan išud-, išūidiia-: The Aim
of Praise.”
The 2nd person of pf. óhiṣe is puzzling in a verse, and a hymn, in which the
god is otherwise entirely referred to in the 3rd ps. (see the surrounding verbs in this
vs.: dadhe (a), śiśrathat (bc), ṛṇvati (fg) &ndash; with pāda f esp. entirely parallel to de with
2nd ps. óhiṣe). I think it must be a transposition of the phrase found in VIII.19.1
devatrā́havyám óhire “They have carried the oblation among the gods.” The
expected 3rd sg. pf. óhe would not fit the meter here.
Though pādas f and g share both a subject (Agni) and a verb (ví) ṛṇvati they
seem semantically somewhat at odds. This semantic disparity is, however,
ameliorated by the fact that their objects, vā́ram and dvā́rā respectively, are
phonologically very close, which similarity was already pointed out by Re.</p>
<h3 id="i1287">I.128.7</h3>
<p>jénya- is of unclear formation (see EWA s.v.), and opinion is generally split
between a derivation from √jan ‘be born’ (e.g., Gr ‘edel’) and √ji ‘win’ (e.g., WG
‘siegreich’), with EWA tentatively opting for the latter. In contrast, I find that a
meaning ‘noble’ vel sim. better fits most passages and consider it a pseudo-gerundive
to √jan, built to the zero-grade formant jā- (cf. in this hymn jāyata 1a, ájāyata 4f, g),
with the semantic development ‘(worthy) to be born, noble, thoroughbred’; its use
with inanimate vásu (e.g., the cmpd. jenyā-vasu- ‘having noble goods’) is simply an
extension comparable to English “noble metals” (vs. base metals).</p>
<h3 id="i129">I.129</h3>
<p>Indra
This hymn is particularly studded with indefinite expressions: pṛ́tanāsu kā́su
cid 2a, 4d, káṃ cid 3b, káyasya cid 5a; later in the hymn rátham kám cid 10d,
anyám &hellip; kám cid 10f.</p>
<h3 id="i1291">I.129.1</h3>
<p>Pādas de show two different constructions with √kṛ ‘make’. On the one hand,
abhíṣṭaye káraḥ is a periphrastic caus. “make to prevail,” with abhíṣṭaye parallel to
the infinitival medhásātaye ‘to gain wisdom’ in 1a; on the other hand, káraḥ …
vājínam is a predicate adj. construction “make (it=chariot) a prize-winner.”
Separating the two constructions is the embedded tag váśaś ca “if you wish,” with
subordinating ca (see Klein DGRV I.250). Though subordinate clauses are almost
never embedded, this functions as a parenthetical like later manye ‘methinks’ and it
also intervenes between two clauses.
Most tr. supply the chariot as subj. of f, but this makes difficulties with the
acc. of g, since, by the conventions of Atyaṣṭi meter, f and g should form a syntactic
unity. I assume instead that sá here refers to Indra in the 2nd ps. and an imperative
should be supplied to make a classic “sa figé” construction (see Jamison 1992); note
that the next vs. begins with a stripped-down version of the same construction: sá
śrudhi “Listen!” As to what imperative to supply, I generate it out of the participial
voc. tūtujāna ‘o thruster’ to the root √tuj. Alternatively, it could be generated from
the verb found in bc prá (…) náyasi, hence “lead forth.”
In g the word order of imā́ṃ vā́caṃ ná makes difficulties. If imā́ṃ vā́cam is a
simile, then we might expect the order *imā́ṃ ná vā́cam. However, note I.121.6 asyā́
uṣáso ná discussed above, also with deictic + noun followed by the simile marker, so
it may be that the placement is by rule (though this requires more investigation).
Note also that in 5b of this hymn the ná follows a clear two-word simile (without
deictic), similarly, if I’m correct, 8g and 5g (cf. also 130.2, 9). Another factor that
may have helped determine the placement of ná here is that f ends (tūtujā)na
vedhásām and g ná vedhásām, so the displacment of the simile particle would
facilitate the echo pattern. Alternatively we might separate imā́m and vā́cam and take
the former as part of the frame “(thrust forward) this one like speech.” If “this one”
refers to the chariot, we must then assume gender attraction from *imám. WG’s tr.
reflects a separation analysis, but with imā́m also representing vā́cam: “… dieses
(Wort) wie das Wort der Vertrauenswürdigen.”</p>
<h3 id="i1292">I.129.2</h3>
<p>The exact semantic relationship between the noun dákṣa- ‘skill’ and the
related (pseudo-)gerundive dakṣā̀yya- is unclear and may be somewhat fluid. Here
‘besought, approached for skill’ seems to fit the context better than ‘to be skillfully
served’ vel sim. (e.g., Re’s “(apte) à être servi-efficacement”). See disc. I.91.3.
The cmpd bhára-hūti-, here tr. as ‘battle cry’, actually contains part of the
quoted cry as its first member: “the cry ‘carry (the day)’.” That is, I interpr. bháraas derived from the impv. bhára with omitted object. For the analytic version of this
expression see V.29.8 … víśve ahvanta devā́, bháram índrāya yád áhiṃ jaghā́na “all
the gods called “bhara” to Indra when he smashed the serpent.”
Pādas de show nicely balanced alliteration, śūraiḥ s
ú
vaḥ sanitā &hellip; viprair
vā́jam, with responsion between yáḥ / yó, -aiḥ /-air, and the final -itā / -utā.
The verb iradhanta and nearby inf. irádhyai (I.134.2) are the only two forms
showing the formant iradh. I connect them with √ṛdh (/rādh) ‘succeed, bring to
success’, though the morphological details escape me.
In g the simile marker ná is superficially positioned as in 1g, after the first
two words of the pāda, but in this case the placement is correct, since the simile only
begins with the second word, átyam.</p>
<h3 id="i1293">I.129.3</h3>
<p>What “swell the bullish skin” means isn’t clear. Ge suggests that it refers to
Indra giving in abundance. I interpr. it in conjunction with the phrase in the next
hymn, I.130.8, mánave … tvácaṃ kṛṣṇā́m arandhayat “he made the black skin
[=barbarians] subject to Manu.” If “black skin” is characteristic of our enemies, I
suggest that the successfully swollen “bullish skin” refers to us, primed for battle.
My “(in that)” introducing c follows Ge: some sort of subordination is
required to account for the verbal accent on parivṛṇákṣi, since otherwise *pári
vṛṇakṣi would be expected.
The placement of utá ‘and’ in d is peculiar, since it precedes a series of
concatenated datives lasting through pāda g. See Klein DGRV I.357-58, though he
can only describe, not explain, this effect.</p>
<h3 id="i1294">I.129.4</h3>
<p>Both abc and de are constructed pleonastically. In a(bc) the phrase
uśmasīṣṭáye (i.e., uśmasi iṣṭáye) “we wish to seek” is semantically but not
etymologically pleonastic (roots √vaś and √iṣ respectively), while in cd ūtáyé, ‘vā
(i.e., ūtáye, ávā) “help to help” is both. When in fg we encounter the etymological
figure stárate stṛṇóṣi (… stṛṇóṣi), we expect another pleonasm, but here of course the
etymologically related words do not duplicate each other functionally because they
have different subjects, though they do essentially mean the same thing: “(he) will
(not) lay (you) low (whom) you lay low.”
Because of this structural pattern in the verse, I do not follow Ge’s (and
others’) attempts to mitigate the pleonasm of abc (e.g., Ge “Wir wünschen, dass …
Indra … gern komme”).
The vaḥ in a is difficult to render in tr. I take it as the usual offhand address to
the patrons on whose behalf we, the ritual officiants, perform all our actions. Because
of the awkwardness I omitted it in the publ. tr., esp. since the benefit to 1st ps. “us” is
so heavily emphasized by fronted full genitive asmā́kam (also in d). These fronted
pronouns were also impossible to render in that position without violence to the
English.
The positioning of yám in fg is worth a brief note. In f it appears immediately
after the first word of its clause, stṛṇóṣi, a standard position. This happens also to be
the last word of its clause. In the tag pāda g stṛṇóṣi yám takes the same position as in
f, but since more material has been added at the front, the yám is now out of position.</p>
<h3 id="i1295">I.129.5</h3>
<p>I borrow śátru- ‘rival’ from 4fg to construe with the indefinite káyasya cid;
cf. VIII.25.15 … vanúṣaḥ … abhímātiṃ káyasya cid “the arrogance of every zealot.”
The phrase téjiṣṭhābhir aráṇibhiḥ “with piercingly hot kindling sticks”
appears in Paruchepa’s I.127.4, which suggests that this phrase must constitute the
simile and the ná is displaced to the right as in 1g. (WG try to avoid this difficulty by
construing téjiṣṭhābhiḥ first with ūtíbhiḥ, but the nearby parallel makes that unlikely.)
The relation between d and e is not clear. Ge makes e part of the yáthā clause,
but purā́seems to call for a past tense and mányase is a present. Moreover, as Old
points out, yáthā purā́is a common self-contained tag. The problem, though, is that
mányase is accented. Old suggests that it is accented because the clause is by its
nature a Nebensatz. The publ. tr. should probably have signaled this by “(in that)” vel
sim.
What is going on in f is unclear, since, as Ge points out, Pūru is depicted in a
positive light in other nearby Paruchepa passages (I.130.7, 131.4). He suggests
supplying énāṃsi with víśvāni, flg. Sāy, thus “carry away all (the guilts) from Pūru.”
But this won’t work with g (as it should in the Atyaṣṭi template), because the guilt
would be coming to us. Perhaps the poet is urging Indra to redistribute the goods of
the patron (Pūru) to us.
This verse is one of the very few places in the Atyaṣṭi series in which the
strict verbal repetition at the end of fg is breached (see also the next vs.). Here váhniḥ
should be final in the pāda, but has been displaced by no ácha. I have no real
explanation for this, save for the fact that when no ácha are adjacent they go last
(I.165.3, III.35.1, IV.34.10), but this hardly seems a sufficient reason.
The g pāda is a syllable too short. I suggest that the simile particle ná has been
haplologized in the sequence āsā́váhnir *ná no ácha. The descriptor āsā́váhni-
(X.115.3) or more usually váhni- āsā́(I.76.4, VI.11.2, VI.19.9) ‘conveyor by mouth’
is otherwise used of Agni, which makes ritual sense; here, without the simile particle,
it would have to be applied to Indra, which does not (hence Ge’s diluted
“Wortführer”). If I am correct, this is another example of a displaced ná simile
marker; of course in this case āsā́váhniḥ would be a quasi-compound ‘conveyor-bymouth’.</p>
<h3 id="i1296">I.129.6</h3>
<p>The vs. begins a little oddly with a solemn proclamation to a drop (índave),
but in my opinion this is actually indirectly evoking the word-play, esp. common in
Maṇḍala IX, between índu- ‘drop’ and índra-, the more natural addressee here. The
transition between drop and Indra is effected by the beginning of the next pāda,
hávyo ná. I take hávya- as a pun; though the occurrences of this stem are
overwhelmingly associated with the root √hū, hvā ‘invoke’, hence ‘to be invoked’, it
could technically also be built to the root √hu ‘pour’, hence ‘to be poured’ (see the
differently accented but identically formed havyá- ‘oblation’). I read hávyaḥ with
both meanings here, with ‘to be invoked’ in the simile and referring to Indra and ‘to
be poured’ directly referring to the drop. Both Indra and the drop stimulate the verbal
skills of the poet. I see no reason to assume that the referent is Bhaga, pace Ge, Re
(and tentatively Old). The rakṣohán- ‘demon-smasher’ in c may be, as often, soma,
but is more likely Indra, given hantā́pāpásya rakṣásaḥ and rakṣoháṇam, both of
Indra, in vs. 11.
The repeated final verb réjati (bc) is nicely echoed in e by (vadhaí)r ajeta.
The cmpd. aghá-śamṣa- finds its analytical parallel in I.128.5 śáṃsād aghā́t.
The lexeme áva √sru, lit. ‘flow down’, appears only here (fg) in the RV; I
suggest that it may idiomatically mean ‘be miscarried, aborted’, and the kṣudrám
‘speck’ in g is the embryo/fetus. For abortion in a hostile context in this group of
hymns, see I.127.3, at least acdg. to my interpretation.
Like the last verse, this one, quite unusually, disrupts the strict final repetition
of the fg pādas, with áva sravet opening f, but distracted to áva … sravet in g. I again
have no explanation for this.</p>
<h3 id="i1297">I.129.7</h3>
<p>The pun on hávya- in 6b is continued by the same double meaning in hótrā-,
a stem that by most accounts does belong both to √hū and √hu. (The standard tr.
only render it by ‘oblation’ here, however.)
The fem. citántī-, which looks like a participle to a 6th cl. pres. or (so Wh Rts.)
a root aor., is formally isolated and requires metrical distraction. Gr suggests (on no
particular basis) emending to *cetáyantyā, but how would such a corruption arise?
WG’s *citáyantyā is more plausible but perhaps unnecessary. Lowe (Participles 289)
takes it as a Caland adjective beside citrá-, but this also seems unnecessary.
The part. sántam in c at first seems pleonastic; it does not have its regular
concessive value. But it was most likely included here in order to indicate which
noun the adj. raṇvám modifies. By itself raṇvám could qualify either rayím or
survī́ryam in b, but sántam identifies it as a masc. and therefore belonging to rayím,
since suvī́ryam is neut. (WG’s use of suvī́ryam as an adj. with rayím in bc is contrary
to the usage of this stem elsewhere.)</p>
<h3 id="i1298">I.129.8</h3>
<p>With the repeated prá-pra I supply a form of the copula for the idiom prá
√as ‘be preeminent’.
Note the common use of instr. pl. adj. (here sváyaśobhiḥ) with (apparent) sg.
pāda-final ūtī́. This interpr. seems preferable to WG, who supply “gods” with the pl.
adj. and take ūtī́separately.
As in 4a this clause contains both a full 1st pl. pronoun (asmé) and the enclitic
2nd pl. vaḥ. As there, I think the 2nd ps. referent is the patrons, in addition to the 1st ps.
ritual officiants, but, once again, a tr. “be preeminent among us for you” seems
clumsy, and I did not render the vaḥ in the publ. tr.
I take the fem. subject of d-g to be personified durmatí-, with Ge. Others,
going back to Sāy, take it to be the jūrṇí- of g (see Ge n. 8d), but I think that belongs
to a simile.
The opening of d, svayáṃ sā́echoes that of 6d svayáṃ só.
Ge refuses to tr. vakṣati and feels that it cannot belong either to √vah or to
√vakṣ. I take it with √vakṣ / ukṣ ‘grow’, as a malformed nonce subjunctive to úkṣa- /
ukṣá- (or preferably a derivationally prior, unattested root formation).
In g I take ná as both the simile marker and the negative. (This is rather like
the haplology of *ná no I posited for 5g.) “Like a firebrand … she will not …” If I am
correct this is yet another example of the ná simile marker displaced to the right.
I.129.9–10: Note identical openings to these two vss: tváṃ na indra rāyā́…, with the
final word of the pādas showing very close phonological patterning: párīṇasā /
tárūṣasā
The standard tr. construe e with fg, such that rátham of e is the referent of
anyám in f. But this seriously violates the structure of Atyaṣṭi, where de always
constitute a unit. Moreover, “another chariot than us” would be a strange expression;
we expect the anyám to refer to an animate opponent in such a construction, esp. if it
is “intending harm” (rírikṣantam). I therefore generate a verbal form ‘help’ from the
agent noun voc. ávitar that ends d: √av + rátham is found elsewhere (I.102.3, 112.12,
etc.).</p>

<p>I do not understand the participle sán in c. It does not have concessive force,
nor does it serve (like sántam 7c) to anchor an unclear gender assignment. It may
convey something like “since you are a god / in your capacity as god,” though this
hardly seems necessary to express of Indra, whose divinity isn’t in question here.</p>

verse towards the smashing of Vṛtra, I find it hard to believe that Indra is just cutting
down trees here, and the doubling of ‘tree’ in vṛkṣám vanínaḥ seems lame (“like a
carpenter a tree, you cut down wooden things [=trees]”). Instead I take vanínaḥ as
gen. sg. referring collectively to a forest (the thing that has wood) and supply Vṛtra /
the serpent as object in the frame. Both vṛtrám and áhim are found elsewhere as obj.
of vṛśca- (though, I admit, not with ní, but usually with ví).</p>

to both speech and you.
One of the rare scramblings of the ends of the fg pādas, which are ordinarily
identical. Here the last two words get flipped: f sātáye dhánā / g dhánāni sātáye. For
other such instances (though not so neatly structured) see I.129.5, 6. The flip in g

<p>Following Ge, I read tatṛṣāṇám in both simile and frame. In the simile it is

The PN arśasānám in g neatly matches tatṛṣāṇám in the same position in f.</p>
<h3 id="i1309">I.130.9</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., this verse, which treats Indra’s theft of the
sun’s wheel and his visit to Uśanā Kāvya, is quite opaque. The first pāda
straightforwardly announces the mythical deed at issue, but things disintegrate after
that.
The next two pādas (bc) introduce a theft of speech and a figure identified as
aruṇá- (‘ruddy’) that are not elsewhere associated with the myth. However, since the
verb muṣāyá- ‘steal’ and the temporal expression prapitvé are found in other
accounts of the myth (I.175.4, IV.30.4, VI.31.3 and IV.16.12, VI.31.3 respectively),
these pādas must contain at least some covert reference to the myth. However, I treat
them as parenthetical because pādas de seem to follow directly from a, and the
present tense muṣāyati does not fit well with the injunctive prá vṛhat of a and the
plupf. ájagan in e.
Pādas de depict Indra’s journey to Uśanā’s dwelling, an incident associated
elsewhere with the wheel-theft narrative. First, note that initial īśāná(ḥ) in c is
echoed by init. uśánā in d. I have treated the peculiar morphology of uśánā at length
(Jamison 2007 Fs. Jasanoff) and concluded that the stem is essentially uninflected
and that it is therefore possible to take uśánā here, with Ge, as an acc. of goal (or as
gen. with a gapped ‘house’), however odd such interpr. may seem at first. Esp. in
later Skt. Uśanā is seldom found without his patronymic kāvyá-, and in the RV even
when the patronymic is absent there is often an indirect reference to it. Here that is
found in the voc. kave, addressed to Indra, which ends pāda e; #uśánā and kave# thus
occupy polarized positions in this two-pāda unit.
I have even less idea of what fg really mean than the rest of the verse. The
repeated word turváṇiḥ usually means ‘surpassing, victorious’ &ndash; see nearby I.128.3 -</p>
<ul>
<li>but this sense does not fit this passage well, esp. with the acc. sumnā́ni. I have
therefore taken turváṇi- as expressing a simple motion sense, but have no confidence
in the correctness of this interpr. (and in fact fairly strong confidence in its error).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i131">I.131</h3>
<p>Indra
The hymn contains a concentration of intensive forms: ánamnata 1a, kárikrat
3f, carkiran 5a, saniṣṇata 5fg. This parade of intensives may express the prolonged
and continuous struggle of the Ārya to subdue their rivals and gain territory with the
constantly sought help of Indra.</p>
<h3 id="i1311">I.131.1</h3>
<p>A form of índra- is positioned at the beginnning of all structurally significant
pādas (a, b, d, f) in Atyaṣṭi.
The intens. ánamnata in my opinion expresses habitual action. Schaeffer
suggests that it is a “Hin- und Her-” or “Auf- und Ab-” motion, but I don’t see the
dignified and stately Heaven and Earth bobbing up and down.</p>
<h3 id="i1312">I.131.2</h3>
<p>Pādas de contain what we would call a mixed metaphor: “we would place
you at our chariot-pole like a boat.” In a RVic context this does not seem a solecism,
but simply an example of the usual piling of image upon image.
I am uncertain of the value of the part. citáyantaḥ in f. In keeping with the
zero-grade root syllable it should mean ‘appear’ or ‘perceive’, but the case frame
makes these interpr. hard to impose. In the publ. tr. I take it as a double I/T (in the
term used in my 1983 book) ‘make (Indra) take notice’, that is, ‘cause to perceive’,
but I am disturbed by the mismatch of the formal and the functional: in this meaning
it should be full-grade cetáya- and there is no easy way to explain a redactional
change to zero-grade. (Ge, Re tr. ‘auszeichnen’, ‘distinguent’ respectively, but this
doesn’t conform to any standard meaning of citáya- or cetáya-. WG take it as an
intrans., “wir glänzenden Nachkommen des Āyu,” which respects the formal shape
but leaves the rest of the pāda without a syntactic skeleton.) Since it has the same
value that I ascribe to īkṣáyat in the next hymn (I.132.5), it may be that citáyant- here
adapted the sense of īkṣáya-, since they both have apparent zero-grade stems.
Another problem with this final sequence is the function and position of ná in
f. It should mark índram as the compared term in a simile (“… like Indra”), but since
Indra should be the target of sacrifice and praise, deflecting him to the simile is
unlikely and leaves us without a corresponding term in the frame. I am loosely taking
ná as having domain over the whole pāda, which implicitly compares us (the subject
of dhīmahi in e) with the Āyus, though this is not how simile marking generally
works &ndash; and will also not work if “we” are identical to the Āyus rather than
compared to them. The mention of the Āyus in the preceding hymn, I.130.6, and in</p>
<h3 id="i1393">I.139.3</h3>
<p>(also Paruchepa) allows but does not require this identification. In sum, the
interpr. of fg is quite uncertain.</p>
<h3 id="i1313">I.131.3</h3>
<p>Although the general semantic range of the root-noun cmpd niḥsṛ́jaḥ in bc is
fairly clear &ndash; it refers to the releasing of the cows enclosed in the cowpen &ndash; its
grammatical identity is not. It can be either a transitive nom. pl., as I take it in the
publ. tr. (so also tentatively Old and, it seems, Re, Narten [SigAor. 266–67]), or a
gen. or abl. infinitive (so Scar, WG). In a sense it scarcely matters.
I follow Narten (Sig.Aor. 266–67) in taking sákṣanta(ḥ) [-aḥ so Pp., not -e] to
√sah ‘conquer, be victorious’ rather than √sac ‘accompany’ (so Gr; Ge’s and Re’s tr.
do not easily reflect either root). WG take it as a type of desiderative with -s-formant,
but also to √sah. Support for this root affiliation comes from sāsahānáḥ in the next
verse, likewise opening the c-pāda.
Note the paired opposition of the two verbs ví √taṃs ‘yank (apart /) back and
forth’ and sám √ūh ‘shove together’, with complementary subj./obj. pairs: people
(yank) Indra / Indra (shoves) people. The point is that the opposing forces fight over
having Indra on their side, each trying to pull him to its side, while Indra sets the two
sides to fighting by pushing them together.
Again I take the intens. āvíṣ kárikrat as expressing habitual or continuous
action: Indra is always showing off his mace.</p>
<h3 id="i1314">I.131.4</h3>
<p>Note the word play across the pāda boundary of a-b: pūrávaḥ, púro. The
same play is found in I.130.7a … púro … pūráve#, though not so neatly juxtaposed.
In d tám is somewhat curiously positioned; it may have been displaced to
allow the verb śā́sas to take initial position in order to echo sāsahānáḥ, which opens
the previous pāda.</p>
<h3 id="i1315">I.131.5</h3>
<p>I take kāráṃ √kṛ in d as an expression from gambling: lit. “to do (the
decisive) deed,” “to make ‘game’,” that is, “to win.” See kāráṃ √hvā in V.29.8.</p>
<h3 id="i1316">I.131.6</h3>
<p>I take the final juṣéta hí of pāda a as a parenthetical remark, contrary to the
standard tr. The rest of the verse (as well as the preceding verse) addresses Indra in
the 2nd ps.; moreover, the position of hí is most easily explained if juṣéta opens the
clause, and a gen. complement with √juṣ, as suggested by Gr, would be (almost?)
unprecedented. The standard tr. (Ge, Re, WG) take asyā́uṣásaḥ as a temporal
expression “on/during this dawn here,” but supposed exx. of this usage elsewhere are
not convincing. The collocation in fg … asyá vedhásaḥ … śrudhi … is structurally
identical to asyā́uṣásaḥ … bodhi, a parallelism that supports my interpr.
If, as I believe, asyā́uṣásaḥ is to be construed with bodhi in b, the first term in
b, arkásya, can serve as transition, since this word means both ‘chant’ and ‘ray’; as
‘ray’ it would group with uṣásaḥ, as ‘chant’ with havíṣaḥ ‘oblation’, linking the
coming of dawn with the dawn sacrifice.</p>
<h3 id="i1317">I.131.7</h3>
<p>The standard tr. take the yó no aghāyáti clause as the only obj. of jahí in d
(“smash [him] who wishes us ill”). This may be correct, but I have opted for the “(X
and) which Y” construction.</p>
<h3 id="i132">I.132</h3>
<p>Indra</p>
<h3 id="i1321">I.132.1</h3>
<p>In the publ. tr. I treat the first member of the three-member cmpd
índratvotāḥ as if it were a voc., since the lit. “aided by you, Indra” seems clumsy.
The verb ádhi vocā could also be a 1st sg. subj., but with most tr. I take it as
2nd sg. impv.; “I” am a less likely advocate for the presser than Indra is.
With Ge I consider ví cayema bháre kṛtám (f) a gambling expression; for
another such expression see the previous hymn, I.131.5d.</p>
<h3 id="i1322">I.132.2</h3>
<p>Pādas abc consist entirely of four locative expressions (with their genitives);
this heavily signposted syntactic pattern allows (/forces) the first word of d, áhan(n)
to be interpreted as the loc. sg. of áhar ‘day’ rather than the 2nd/3rd sg. root impf. of
√han, which otherwise would be strongly favored in an Indra context. (Note that the
identical opening, áhann índro, is found at IV.28.3, with the verb.) The locatives in
1d, f also reinforce the loc. reading, esp. asmín áhani (1d). I don’t know exactly what
to call this poetic trick &ndash; it is aggressively a non-pun.
āprá- in a is a hapax, and there is no consensus on its meaning or derivation;
see EWA s.v. I am inclined to follow Ge (etc.)’s connection with āprī́- (a noun that
doesn&rsquo;t occur in the RV, though the verbal syntagm does) with a meaning ‘propitiator’
vel sim. This fits its dependence on vákmani ‘at the speech’ and may also
thematically echo ádhi vocā ‘advocate, speak on behalf of’ in 1e. It could indeed
refer to the reciter of Āprī hymns. The other leading etymological candidate is ā́√pṛ
‘fill’ (so WG; see Old), but “the filler” seems to have less connection with speaking
than “the propitiator.”
The way the reflexive adj. svásmin works in bc is a little tricky: “of X, at his
very own anointing.”
On the basis of I.134.2 I follow Ge in taking krāṇásya as passive and referring
to the soma. Thus in bc we find the anointing (áñjasi) of the two primary ritual
substances, fire (b) and soma (c). Alternatively, if it seems desirable to keep the
referent the same in the two pādas, one can follow Re, WG in taking krāṇá- as
“active,” referring to Agni.
The use of ‘head’ (śíras-/śīrṣán-) to refer to an individual person is not, as far
as I know, otherwise found in the RV, though the semantic dev. is obvious and
precedented in English.</p>
<h3 id="i1323">I.132.3</h3>
<p>A very opaque verse, which has received multiple interpretations. I will
discuss only my own, very tentative, one here.
I take pāda a as the announcement to Indra of the “pleasurable offering”
(práyaḥ) currently set out for him at this sacrifice (asmín yajñé 1f); see nearby
I.134.1, 135.4 for similar usage of práyas-. This glittering offering reminds the poet
of a previous one (pratnáthā). I take the next two pādas (bc) as describing this
previous one; the relative locative yásmin yajñé is a temporal expression that picks
up the temporal pratnáthā.
The crux in bc is the pair vā́ram (b), vā́r (c). Since the former is an obj. of
ákṛṇvata and the latter a (possible) subj. of ási, an analysis as a masc. (or at least
gendered) root noun suggests itself, but such a noun has at best a precarious
existence (see Schindler WurNom s.v.). Nonetheless, I think it must be posited here;
the other solutions, which include taking the two forms to two separate stems (see,
e.g., Gr, Lub) or decomposing them into vā + a… (Hoffmann apud Schindler, WG),
do too much violence to the patterns of Atyaṣṭi meter. With Ge and Re in their
separate ways (“Schirmer(?)” “protecteur”) I take the form to √vṛ ‘cover’ and tr.
‘shield’ (as in X.93.3). In b this noun in the acc. is in apposition to unexpressed tvā
‘you’, i.e., Indra &ndash; which is the first obj. to a double acc. √kṛ construction ‘make X
into Y’. (For Indra as a home, see 5fg. For kṣáya- in a metaphorical sense, see the
next hymn, I.133.7a.) In the tag-pāda the construction has been switched from acc. to
nom., and the 2nd sg. ref. is now overt (asi ‘you are’). A nom. vā́r conforms to this
case switch; however, since kṣáya- is masc., we should expect *kṣáyaḥ here. I
explain the anomaly by the pressures of Atyaṣṭi, which requires strict identity
between the finals of b and c; kṣáyam is simply repeated from b or made an honorary
neut. for the occasion. It is possible to avoid this problem by assuming that vā́r- has
verbal rection (so implicitly Ge “der Schirmer(?) des Hauses”; see also Schindler
WurNom), but this introduces further complications, and I prefer the double acc.
interpr. anyway.
If bc refers to a time in the distant past when Indra was made into our
protector, d may then call for the restatement of this fact at the current ritual
(depicted in pāda a by my interpr.) The expression nū́itthā́te pūrváthā ca pravā́cyam
“Now in the current way and in the earlier one it is to be proclaimed of you” in 4a
supports my interpr of the larger stucture of this verse, namely that it concerns the
conceptual intersection of the current ritual and the previous one and that what has
been said before needs to be restated at the current sacrifice. Note also that, though
the form of √vac, voceḥ in this case, now has the preverb ví, the sequence vocer ádha,
with the adv. ádha, echoes ádhi vocā in 1e.
In e I take raśmíbhiḥ as a temporal expression “with the rays (of the sun),”
identifying the time as dawn, as is very common. The standard tr. take it as an instr.
of the means of seeing; this is not impossible, but seems less idiomatic. See further
ad I.135.3.
I don’t quite know what to do with ánu in f, but given the other difficulties in
the verse, this is a minor problem.</p>
<h3 id="i1325">I.132.5</h3>
<p>For īkṣáyat see Jamison 1983: 123. It has the same double I/T value I also
ascribe to citáyanta(ḥ) in I.131.2f.
In de I take bā́dhe as an infinitive with tásmai [=Indra] as subj. and ā́yuḥ
prajā́vat as obj. This requires √bādh to have a positive value (‘thrust [s.th. good]
towards [s.o.]’), rather than the usual negative ‘thrust away, repel’, but see I.61.2 for
a similar positive sense.</p>
<h3 id="i1326">I.132.6</h3>
<p>The dual dvandva indrā-parvatā ‘Indra and Mountain’ raises the question of
the identity of ‘Mountain’; as in III.53.1 I think it is a designation of Indra’s mace
(vájra). That the mace shows up in the instr. in the same pāda as the dual verb that
has Indra and Parvata as implicit subj. (c vájreṇa … hatam) does not, I think, rule out
this interpr.: as “Mountain” the mace is animatized; in the instrumental it is an
inanimate instrument.
The tám of pāda a is an anticipatory placeholder for táṃ-tam íd in b, c.
Re and WG take chantsat (√chand) in d as meaning ‘appear’: “there will
appear a gáhanam for him …” &ndash; that is, ‘come into view, take shape’. But though
‘appear’ in modern European lgs. can cover that sense, the ‘appear’ sense of √chand
is generally ‘have the appearance of, look like’. Ge’s interpr. is more complex: he
takes the vájra- to be the underlying subject, which to the fugitive will look like a
gáhanam. This interpr. represents the sense of √chand better, but at the cost of
producing something close to nonsense, at least as I tried to understand it. I instead
use the developed sense ‘be pleasing’ of √chand: the point is that once Indra and
Parvata start smiting him, even falling into an abyss will be preferable.</p>
<h3 id="i133">I.133</h3>
<p>Indra</p>
<h3 id="i1331">I.133.1</h3>
<p>The popular, Atharvan-like character of the first hymn of this composite (see
publ. intro.) (vss. 1–5) is partly signalled by the two l-forms in this verse: abhivlágya
and vailasthāná-. Both forms are found only in this hymn. The first belongs to the
putative root √vlag, confined to this hymn (this gerund 1c, 2a; nominal abhivlaṅga4b); the second, in the variants vailasthānaká- and mahā́vailastha-, appears also in 3c,
d. Neither has an agreed-upon etymology. For √vlag EWA suggests a connection
with √vṛj ‘twist’. I see it rather as an l-form of √vraj ‘proceed, advance upon’, which
in several of its (few) occurrences also appears with abhí. The nasal in abhivlaṅgamight be a problem, but roots ending in -j are prone to secondary nasals (√raj, rañj
‘color’, √saj, sañj ‘hang’, probably √svaj, svañj ‘embrace’).
As for vaila(-sthana-), it also has been subjected to multiple etymologies (see
disc. WG ad loc.). I take it as an l-form of vṛddhied vīrá- ‘hero’; the vṛddhied r-form
is found in vaíra(-deya-) (V.61.8) ‘(payment) of wergeld’. The ‘place of vaira-/vaila’
would be ‘the place of heroes or heroism’, i.e., the battlefield.
Note the juxtaposition across pāda-boundary of ṛténa ‘with truth’ and drúhaḥ
‘deceits’. I take anindrā́ḥ as implicitly contrastive with mahī́ḥ: though the lies may be
great, they lack Indra and therefore lack ultimate power.</p>
<h3 id="i1332">I.133.2</h3>
<p>vaṭūrín- (/mahā́vaṭūrin-) in cd is an impossible hapax, and the wisest course
(taken by Ge, WG) is not to tr. it. (Re tries out éperonné ‘spurred on’, with no
indication of where he got it.) Unwisely I tender both a tr. (‘overcoming obstacles’)
and an etymology, though more in a spirit of adventure than with any confidence that
they are correct. I start with the idiom vṛtrá- √tṝ ‘overcome obstacle(s)’, found, e.g.,
in the fairly well-attested neut. noun vṛtratū́rya- and adj. vṛtratúr-. A hypothetical
Middle Indic form to an underlying *vṛtratū/ur- would be *vaṭṭa-tū/ur- (since dentals
following original *ṛ often undergo retroflexion: see von Hinüber, Mittelindisch2
165). This could then undergo haplology to *vaṭṭū/ur- and then simplification of the
cluster (though we might expect *vāṭū/ur-) to the form to which an -in–suffix was
affixed. This is more machinery than should be deployed to explain a hapax, but the
explanation falls (loosely) within the realm of possibility &ndash; and a MIA source would
fit with the other words in the hymn belonging to a lower or aberrant register. Still it
would probably be more sensible to follow Kuiper (see EWA s.v.) in taking it as a
non-Indo-Aryan word.
Even leaving aside vaṭūrin-, the verse doen’t make a lot of sense: what does it
mean for Indra to cut off heads with his foot?</p>
<h3 id="i1333">I.133.3</h3>
<p>In an unpubl. paper Arlo Griffiths argues that armaká- means ‘mudflat’.
Note the -ka- forms, vailasthānaká- and armaká- (2x) &ndash; pleonastic -ka- often
being a sign of colloquial register (see Jamison, -ka-). Since diminutivization (or
diminishment/belittling) is one of the apparent nuances of the -ka-suffix, it is
somewhat amusing that we find “diminutivized” vailasthānaké beside mahā́vailasthe.</p>
<h3 id="i1334">I.133.4</h3>
<p>I have tr. the fem. gen. pl. rel. yā́sām as ‘when’, to make the structure of
subord. cl. (ab) – main cl. (cd) work better. However it is possible (and perhaps
preferable) to take the yā́sām cl. as simply continuing vs. 3: “Smash down the troop
of those witches … of which (witches) you scattered afar thrice fifty.” 4cd would
then be an independent sentence.
Who the subject of cd is depends on what the verb manāyati means. Ge takes
the subj. as a generic, or at least unidentified, “er”: “das merkt er sich fein von dir.”
Re thinks the subj. is one of the witches, but like Ge he takes manāya- to mean
something like ‘pay attention, note, understand’. The verb is an obvious denom. to
manā́-, which is interpr. by some as ‘Andacht’ (prayer, reverence) (see EWA s.v.
MAN1
), with the verb then meaning ‘andächtig sein’ (be reverent towards)(so WG
here, again with a generic subject, “man”). But since I interpret manā́as ‘zeal’, for
me the verb means ‘display zeal’, with the implicit subj. Indra’s deed, represented by
the neut. pronouns tát (c) and takát (d).
Pronominal -ka-forms, like takát, are an extreme sign of colloquial register &ndash;
or rather of the poets overtly signalling their conscious deployment of this register.</p>
<h3 id="i1335">I.133.5</h3>
<p>This last verse of the colloquially bloodthirsty first hymn of the composite
pulls out all the stops with striking interlocking phonetic figures in ab: #piśaṅga &hellip;
#piśā́cim &hellip; and (piśáṅg)abhrṣṭ̥ im ambhr̥ṇám# &hellip; (s)ám mr̥ṇa#
The latter sequence helps explain why we have another impossible hapax:
ambhṛṇá-; as often, difficult words appear in contexts that play on their phonological
shape. Again, wisdom would suggest leaving it untr. or at least tr. with a vague
contextually generated term like ‘monstrous’, but I have had the temerity to suggest
another very shaky etymology. I suggest that this is a colloquial deriv. of the lexeme
ánu √bhṛ, a euphemistic idiom that refers to sexual assault and penetration &ndash; e.g., in
the cosmic incest myth (X.61.5). See comm. ad I.88.6 and Jamison 1981 (“A Vedic
sexual pun: ástobhayat, anubhartrī, and RV I.88.6,” Acta Orientalia 42 [1981] 55-
63). The initial am would represent an apocopated form of the preverb ánu, a change
that fits the register in the rest of the hymn. My ‘ballsy’ is an attempt to capture the
slangy irreverence. Since Piśācas are later associated with sexual misconduct
towards women &ndash; at least on the basis of the Paiśāca “marriage” (e.g., MDŚ III.34),
which involves taking advantage of a maiden who is asleep, intoxicated, or
disordered &ndash; a sexual interpr. of the adjective qualifying the Piśāci here would be
entirely fitting. The same idiom, with an even more MIA cast, may be found in
AirĀr ambhaṇa- ‘Bauch der Laute’ (belly of the lute); as discussed in my 1981 paper,
the vīnā bears some resemblance to male genitalia and jokes about its shape are still
current in South Asia.</p>

<p>Although the adverb avár ‘downward’ occurs only here, beside more
common avás, it is probably not the result of secondary alteration of avás-, since it
has an Old Aves. correspondent auuarə̄(Y. 29.11).
The accent on dādṛhí must be owing to its juxtaposition with immediately
following śrudhí.
ápūruṣaghna- is universally taken as ‘not smashing men’, and this is certainly
possible. However, since the focus of this composite hymn is on Indra’s destruction
of various demonic beings, I think an interpr. ‘smashing non-men’ fits better. The
context remains violent, so remarking on Indra’s forebearance towards men would
break the martial mood.</p>

<p>In f prá cakṣaya ródasī vāsayoṣásaḥ, ródasī is most naturally the obj. of prá
cakṣaya and uṣásaḥ of vāsaya, but this seems to leave unaccented vāsaya opening its
clause. The solution is easily found: in the tag-pāda g the same sequence vāsayoṣásaḥ
is preceded in its clause by śrávase. Whether we attribute lack of accent in f to
redactional erasure (so Old) or assume that vāsaya was originally unaccented
because of its repetition in the tag-pāda does not matter much.

<p>I take dáṃsu here and in I.141.4 as the loc. pl. of the root noun dám- ‘house’

<h3 id="i1345">I.134.5</h3>
<p>Note the plethora of -an-forms in abc: turaṇyávaḥ, iṣananta, bhurváṇi (2x).
In b iṣananta bhurváṇi is echoed by iṣanta bhurváṇi in the tag-pāda c. WG
take iṣananta and iṣanta to two different verbs (“treiben” and “wünschen”
respectively), but as Re remarks, the formal variation is insignificant in Atyaṣṭi (see
duhre, duhrate in 6fg below), and it would be far more disruptive to this structure to
change the verb root in the echo. This twinning of iṣananta and iṣanta here makes it
likely that the former has only minimal connections to the other forms belonging to a
stem iṣaṇa-, otherwise confined to the Indra hymns of IV. See comm. ad IV.16.9.
I take bhurváṇi as an adverbial complement to the verb (“set themselves
aquiver”)(sim. Old and Re), and therefore in c I am reluctant to construe apā́m with
bhurváṇi as Ge (and differently WG) do. My solution, which is admittedly ad hoc, is
to supply a simile containing *ūrmáyaḥ (cf., e.g., IX.95.3 apā́m ivéd ūrmáyas
tárturāṇāḥ for soma drinks [as here] compared to waves of water constantly in
motion).
In its two occurrences (I.151.5, X.91.2) takva-vī́- ‘(in) swooping pursuit’
refers to a bird of prey. In this passage most tr. take tsā́rin- ‘stealthy one’ as a hunter
in pursuit of game; this may be correct and is reflected in the publ. tr. However, it’s
possible that the stealthy one is the bird of prey, becoming weary as he circles in the
air (“in his swooping pursuit” takvavī́ye). It might seem odd for the bird to
“reverently invoke” Indra, but this is hardly beyond the range of RVic discourse.
The verb pāsi in fg is universally taken as belonging to √pā ‘protect’, and this
is morphologically the easier interpretation: it would be a straightforward root
present. However, context favors a connection with √pā ‘drink’. As Old points out,
dhármaṇā is used in IX.25.2, 63.22 to refer to Vāyu’s right to the first drink of soma,
and the next verse here, 6abc, spells out this entitlement in almost over-literal detail;
it can be considered a species of poetic repair, making it clear that pāsi here belongs
to ‘drink’. (See also I.135.1de.) Moreover, “protect from every creature” seems an
odd expression, since “creatures” are generally positively viewed or at least neutral.
The problem with ‘drink’ of course is that this root makes a root aorist, not a root
present. But at least one other form with primary endings is universally taken to the
‘drink’ root: pānti in II.11.14, which in fact describes the same situation as here,
Vāyu’s first drink of soma: prá vāyávaḥ pānty ágraṇītim “The Winds drink the first
offering.” These two primary forms may be nonce presents or subjunctives (in which
case the tr. here should be “you will drink …”), or pāsi here could be a nonce -si
imperative.
I take the two abl. in fg in different senses: víśvasmād bhúvanāt as a temporal
expression, but asuryā̀t as causal.</p>

<p>For abc as a “repair” of pāsi in 5fg, see disc. there.
Most supply barhis as the obj. of the perf. part. vavarjúṣīṇām, and this is quite
possibly correct. By contrast I take it in the metaphorical sense “twist s.o. towards
oneself,” that is, attract to the sacrifice &ndash; though we might prefer a medial form in
that sense. And the mention of barhis at the beginning of the next hymn (I.135.1a)
may support that standard view. As Kü points out (461 and n. 873), there’s no
obvious explanation for the full-grade stem (expect *vavṛjúṣ-).</p>

<p>Unaccented niyutvate in bc appears to be a voc. to an otherwise unattested -istem niyutvati-, whose formation would be morphologically peculiar (a secondary -istem built to a -vant-stem?!). It must be a nonce manipulation of the standard -vantstem niyútvant-. As Re points out, vocatives in -pate may have had some influence in
producing this rhyme form. Since Vāyu is almost the only referent of niyútvant-, it is
highly unlikely that the form represents a dative to the -vant-stem that lost its accent
for some reason.</p>

<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., this hymn is divided into tṛcas and each tṛca
was probably originally a single hymn. This then is the final verse of 1–3, and it
exhibits very heavy ring-composition: 3b … úpa yāhi vītáye reprises 1a úpa no yāhi
vītáye almost exactly, and 3ab … niyúdbhiḥ śatínibhiḥ … sahasrínibhiḥ … echoes
1bc sahásreṇa niyútā … śatínībhiḥ. Note also 3d távāyám bhāgáḥ …, which is
identical to the beginning of 2d.
As discussed ad I.134.3, the expression here, sáraśmiḥ sū́rye sácā
“accompanying the reins [=rays] when the sun (rises)” seems to me a fuller version
of the temporal expression raśmíṣu (/raśmíbhiḥ) “at/with the reins=rays.” See also
I.137.2e sākáṃ sū́ryasya raśmíbhiḥ “simultaneous with the reins=rays of the sun.”
I.135.4–6: As indicated in the publ. intro., this tṛca is constructed in parallel to 1–3,
but addressed to the two gods Vāyu and Indra rather than Vāyu alone. I will not call
attention to the pervasively parallel phraseology: a simple skimming of the two sets
of verses will amply demonstrate it.</p>

<p>Here the vā́yav índraś ca construction is stretched from a to c, and in f the
sequence índraś ca yāthaḥ (lit. “and Indra, you two drive”) presupposes a 2nd ps. sg.

índraś ca construction.

<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., I have no idea what the figtree represents

<h3 id="i1359">I.135.9</h3>
<p>The references here are also murky, but I am inclined to see the plural
referents as both Maruts and soma drinks. In favor of the Maruts: 1) they are called
bāhv-òjas -in VIII.20.6; 2) they are sometimes called ukṣán- (e.g., V.52.3); 3) the
non-waning cows of 8ef are also found in the Marut hymn V.55.5 ná vo dasrā úpa
dasyanti dhenávaḥ; 4) they fly (e.g. V.59.7), and they&rsquo;re associated with the shaking
of mountains and the flowing of rivers (flying in the river could be rain); 5)
approaching the figtree in 8b might be like V.54.12, where they “shake the gleaming
berry (píppalam)” &ndash; the pippala is supposed to be a fig.

<p>The syntax of this verse is quite contorted.
The hapax sárī is problematic. Flg. Old, I think it must be interpr. in the
context of the idiom vā́jam √sṛ ‘run for the prize’; cf. the root noun cmpd. vāja-sṛ́tand passages like I.62.16 sómo vā́jam ivāsarat. But what sort of form is sárī? Gr
takes it as an -in- stem, which would be the simplest solution save for the accent,
which should fall on the suffix (*sarī́). AiG II.2.328 explicitly rejects this analysis,
suggesting instead (p. 407, flg. a brief mention by Old, in turn inspired by Ludwig)
that, with following bhava, it is an early example of a cvi construction. But again, we
should expect suffixal accent (see Whitney, Gr. §1093), and moreover the cvi
construction is at best embryonic at this period (akhkhalīkṛ́tya VII.103.3 being the
only likely example in the RV). Taking it as a rathī́-type masc. confronts the same
issue with accent. Since an analysis as an -in-stem encounters only the accentual
problem, not the chronological one of the cvi construction, and since -in-stems are
considerably better attested than rathī́- masculines, an -in-stem analysis with
unexplained accent retraction seems the best among the poor choices. As for my tr.,
since “be a runner after” seemed clumsy, I have substituted “be a contender.”</p>

<p>The pass. aor. saṃdā́yi is taken by Gr (etc.) to √dā ‘tie’, surely correctly.
But there are several other occurrences of this lexeme sám √dā that also appear to
express the same idiom, but, with different morphological realizations, are generally
assigned to √dā ‘give’ (though see, e.g., Kü 244). The idiom, in its fullest expression,
is sám √dā nā́bhim [ACC] nā́bhā(u) [LOC] ‘tie navel to navel’, that is, to assert a
family connection (often between gods or semidivine figures like seers and us
humans. In the passive the first navel is of course in the nom. – a nom. that is gapped
in this passage. Another ex. of the idiom is found in IV.44.5, also passive, this time
with the loc. gapped (or substituted for by a prn.): sáṃ yád dadé nā́bhiḥ pūrvyā́vām
“because (our) ancient umbilical tie is attached to you (or, to your [navel]),” of the
Aśvins. Instead of sám the preverb can be ā́: see IX.10.8 with the fullest form of the
idiom, containing both case forms of ‘navel’: nā́bhā nā́bhiṃ na ā́dade “he has bound
his navel to our navel.” Also IX.79.4 diví te nā́bhā paramó yá ādadé “It was in
heaven, to its navel, that your highest (navel) was bound.” (This last tr. is different
from the publ. one; see comm. ad IX.79.4 for the alteration and the difficulties in the
passage.) Another ex. of the idiom is probably found in the noun saṃdadí- in IX.99.7,
though the telltale navel is absent. See disc. there. The other occurrence of saṃdadíin II.39.7 even more attenuated, but still expresses the sense of attachment. A variant
of the idiom, ā́√tan nā́bhim LOC is found in I.105.9; see comm. there.</p>

<p>The part. āśrāváyanta(ḥ) is best taken as predicated, substituting for a main
verb. The standard tr. supply a finite verb (“invite” vel sim.), but this seems
unnecessary.
This form also participates in a fine example of case disharmony in a simile
(in the sense of Jamison 1982): śrāváya-/śraváya- can mean both “cause to be heard”
and “cause to hear.” In the simile (pāda b) it takes ślókam as obj. and means “cause
to be heard”; in the frame (pāda a) it takes yuvā́m and means “cause to hear,” while
in the tag-pāda (c) it likewise takes yuvā́m but also a 2nd acc. havyā́, with the meaning
“cause X to hear (about) Y.” With Ge I supply “of the pressing stone” with ślókam
on the basis of 10e ślókam ádreḥ.
Unlike the standard tr. I supply “chariot” as the obj. of anuśā́satā and take
rájaḥ as an acc. of extent.</p>
<h3 id="i1397">I.139.7</h3>
<p>On the difficulties of interpr. of this verse, see publ. intro.
In f Ge and Re take aryamā́as subject of duhre and are then at pains to
assemble enough other personnel to count, at least conceptually, as a plural with pl.
verb duhre. (Cf. Re “Aryaman (ainsi que) l&rsquo;officiant (et autres) l&rsquo;ont traite-à-fond.”)
But not only does this not work grammatically but it does not make sense: since the
gods gave the cow to the Aṅgirases (de), surely they are the ones who have milked
her dry. Although major syntactic breaks in the middle of pādas are rare, in this case
we must take sg. aryamā́as starting a new sentence (so also WG). Note that pāda a
also seems to have a syntactic break after śṛṇuhi, though it is less jarring because the
subject of the next clause remains the same.
As for the sense, I am quite baffled. The Aṅgirases seem to have mistreated
the cow, or at least gotten everything they can out of her. But Aryaman also has
knowledge, and perhaps use, of her. I suggest very tentatively that since Aryaman is
associated with the householder’s fire and with hospitality rites, this may be an early
and oblique reference to a division between what will later be known as śrauta rites
and gṛhya rites. But I have no confidence in this.</p>
<h3 id="i1398">I.139.8</h3>
<p>On asmád abhí see comm. ad V.33.3.
The standard tr. supply ‘word’ (vácaḥ Ge n. 8a) as the neut. sg. subject with
yád … citrám … in de, but a singular form of paúṃsya- in ab is more easily supplied
from context, and deeds can easily “resound” by semantic transference.
I interpr. the structure of d–g differently from the standard interpr., which
take tád as the antecedent both of the yád clause in de (yád … ghóṣāt …) and the one
in f, yác ca duṣṭáram, echoed by g. By this interpr. the two yád clauses are overtly
conjoined (yád … yác ca) around the main clause referent (tád), with the 2nd
embedded in the main cl. before the verb didhṛtā́in the echo pāda. Klein explicitly
accounts for this disruption of structure by asserting that the yác ca clause “has been
postposed in pāda c because its required repetition in d provides a coherent
punaḥpadam” [he must mean f and g respectively]. This seems like a bit of a cop out
to me – it wouldn’t be “required” to be repeated if it hadn’t ended up in that position
in the first place, for other reasons. Contrary to this analysis, I take f(g) as containing
an “X and which Y” (tád … yác ca) construction of the familiar type, with two
different referents. The X is also further specified by the preposed rel. cl. in de (yád
vaḥ … ámartyam), but the yád clause in de and the one in f (echoed by g) are entirely
unconnected and have different referents. The placement of the yác ca clause and the
ca seem to me strong evidence for my interpretation.
As for the referent of yác ca duṣṭáram (fg), I supply dyumnám also from
context (b dyumnā́ni); cf. also III.37.10 dyumnáṃ dadhiṣva duṣṭáram.</p>
<h3 id="i13910">I.139.10</h3>
<p>The praiṣa quoted at the beginning of this verse, matching the one opening
the hymn, situates this verse in the ritual here and now, and such a context gives
clues for the solution of some of the difficulties. Because the context is the soma
sacrifice (the praügaśastra is part of the morning soma pressing; see also the pressing
stone in e), I follow Ge in taking vanínaḥ as the gen. sg. of ‘wooden’ (rather than as
the nom. pl. of a putative vanín- ‘winning’, with Re). The ‘wooden’ is the wooden
cup and by extension its contents: soma. This interpr. in turn makes it unnec. to take
vanta as a haplology of 3rd pl. *vananta (see Old). The bulls of b are likewise
interpretable in a ritual context as the soma drinks.
Pāda f contains an incomprehensible hapax araríndāni, which, as so often,
may have been stimulated by the phonological context: ádhārayadararindāni. Given
the construction of the tag-pāda g it should refer to something compatible with
sádmāni ‘seats’. My ‘fittings’ is only a placeholder, loosely implying a connection
with √ṛ ‘fit together’ (also in ará- ‘wheel-spoke’, etc.) and inspired by the
(presumably entirely accidental) echo of ἀραρίσκω. What -ind- would be under this
analysis is utterly unclear.</p>

<h3 id="i1401">I.140.1</h3>
<p>The referent of dhāsí- ordinarily ‘wellspring’ (see comm. I.62.3), which is
identified here as Agni’s yóni- ‘womb’, is unclear. In VIII.43.7, 29 and III.7.3 (also
perhaps III.7.1) the dhāsí- is the plants (=firewood) to be “eaten,” i.e., burned, by the
fire, hence the source (‘wellspring’) of the fire’s growth. Since whatever it is here
can be carried (prá bharā), firewood makes sense, and this interpr. is supported by
the fact that the plants that Agni burns are an important theme in this hymn (vss. 2ab,
6–8). Though in I.122.13, a passage adduced by WG, I render dhāsí- as ‘gush’
(developing a different aspect of ‘wellspring, fountain’; cf. also VI.67.6), that sense
does not work well here because it must be identified with the yóni- and capable of
being carried.</p>
<h3 id="i1402">I.140.2</h3>
<p>I take trivṛ́t as a qualifier of ánnam ‘food’ (so also Re, Old [SBE], Sāy, WG);
however, I am not sure what tripartition of food is meant. Ge in his n. (2a) suggests
wood, ghee, and soma (more or less flg. Sāy), but because the next pāda concerns
only the plant food that Agni has eaten and that regenerates in a year, I am reluctant
to divide the focus. It is also possible to take trivṛ́t as an adverb, as Ge does (“… eilt
dreifältig …”), but this merely transfers the problem.
In the second hemistich “the one / the other” are easier to identify. Pāda c
concerns the ritual fire, while d treats the wild fire, each represented by a
characteristic animal: in c the “thoroughbred bull” (jényo vṛ́ṣā), which, despite its
power, is a domesticated beast, while the (wild) elephant (vāraṇáḥ) of d rampages in
the forest.
I don’t understand the position of ī: ī(m) and sīm generally occupy
Wackernagel’s position. In this case it may mark jagdhám as a notional relative
clause, as in my tr. “what was eaten,” though the following word púnaḥ
unfortunately must be construed with the main verb vāvṛdhe.
In c the initial position of anyásya violates my rule (1997, Fs. Beekes) for
definite anyá- placement, but anyéna in d is correctly positioned.</p>

<p>The middle voice of tarete, fairly rare for forms of √tṝ, is responsible for my

against each other.
On √dhvaṃs see comm. ad IV.19.7.
Both sā́cya and kúpaya- are hapaxes, though the likely root affiliation of the
former with √sac ‘accompany, attend upon’ makes its interpr. easier. With AiG
II.2.793, 798, I take it to be a gerundive to this root. As for kúpaya-, I find it hard to
separate it from the root √kup ‘quiver, quake’, despite the unclarity of its formation
(suffix? accent?), and find the alternative analysis as ku-paya(s?)- (most recently,
tentatively WG) unlikely.
várdhanam pitúḥ “the increaser of his father” is one of the RVic poet’s

the well-tended fire in turn produces prosperity and increase for the ritual officiants.</p>
<h3 id="i1404">I.140.4</h3>
<p>The thrust of this vs. is a pile-up of adjectives describing Agni’s flamehorses, set within a frame consisting of the verb úpa yujyante “they are harnessed,”
postponed until the final pāda, and a dative of benefit occurring in the first: mánave
mānavasyaté.
mānavasyaté is found only here, and both its sense and its formation are
unclear. It is generally rendered as if it were a denominative (Ge ‘dem
Menschenfreundlichen’, Re ‘agissant en homme’), but this would assume a -yáformation built to a vṛddhi-derivative pseudo-s-stem *mānavas- (beside mānavá-,
loosely like mánus- beside mánu-). I instead interpret it as a (pseudo-)future
participle in -syánt- built to the common vṛddhi deriv. mānava-. The future suffix
reinforces the sense of the vṛddhi deriv. ‘descending from Manu’ by emphasizing the
fact that (some of) these descendants are still to come. (If such a derivation seems too
radical, it could be mediated by a denom. *mānava-yá- + -syánt-, which underwent
haplology.)
asamaná- means lit. something like ‘not together, not gathered’; ‘breaking
ranks’ seems a dynamic tr. of the underlying concept (Re ‘allant en sens divers’).
(See also VII.5.3.) It thus forms a semantic pair with mumukṣvàḥ ‘seeking to break
free’ in a. I do not follow Ge (/WG) in their derivation from the extended meaning of
sámana- as ‘battle’, hence (Ge) ‘ohne Kampf’.
Note the phonetic figure opening the vs.: mumukṣvò mánave mānavasyaté.</p>
<h3 id="i1405">I.140.5</h3>
<p>The vs. contains three “intensive” participles: kárikrataḥ, mármṛśat, and
nā́nadat. All three, in my opinion, express repetitive or repeated action. In particular
kárikrataḥ, in my tr. ‘making and remaking’, nicely reflects the constantly changing
shape of the smoke rising from the raging flames.
I take mahī́m ‘great’ (fem.) separately from avánim and referring to the earth;
by this interpr. the whole earth serves as Agni’s course (‘stream bed’).
I.140.6–8: This trio of verses treats the union (by burning) of the hyper-masculine
Agni/fire and the plants (feminine). This must be the “der erotische Grundton” of the
hymn that Ge mentions in his intro. This sexual union leads to the death of the plants
(8b) and their regrowth and transformation into a different form (7cd, 8). Or so is my
interpr.; acdg. to some, the flames are sometimes the referents, rather than the plants.
This proposed split reference seems to me to break the thematic unity of the verses
and the climax in 8 of the death and renewed life of the females who unite with Agni.</p>
<h3 id="i1406">I.140.6</h3>
<p>The concentration of intensives continues in this verse: námnate (a), róruvat
(b), davidhāva (d).
The ‘bending’ of pāda a of course describes the flickering motion of the
flames.
Because of the theme mentioned ad vss. 6–8, of the bodily transformation of
the plants by burning, I take tanvàs in c as referring to the bodies of the plants, not,
with most tr., that of Agni.
I don’t entirely understand the position of ca in c. Klein (DGRV I.222–23,
259–60) suggests that it has been bumped by the participle opening the clause and
pāda. It is certainly the case that ca could not immediately follow that first word
without metrical distress: five-syllable ojāyámānaḥ entirely fills the opening, and
since the caesura cannot precede an enclitic, placing ca after the participle would
result in an opening of 6.</p>
<h3 id="i1407">I.140.7</h3>
<p>The idiom punar √vṛdh ‘grow again’ recurs from 2b, again referring to the
plants immolated by the fire (at least in my opinion; others take the subject to be the
flames). Here their regeneration is linked with their contact or merger with divinity.
The final pāda is variously interpreted. I take the plants still to be the subject
and the form “different from their parents” refers to their burned residue as ash and
cinders, as opposed to the branches and leaves that were fed to the fire. But if pitróḥ
is taken as a loc., the referent may be different; some take it as referring to Heaven
and Earth (Sāy, Old [SBE], WG).</p>
<h3 id="i1408">I.140.8</h3>
<p>Again there is a difference of opinion as to referent. With Old (SBE) I take
the plants once again as the subjects of pāda a (so, partly, WG), contra Sāy, Ge, Re,
Kü (419), who interpret them as flames.</p>
<h3 id="i1409">I.140.9</h3>
<p>The hapax tuvigrá- in b is generally interpr. as having a thematized form of
√gṝ ‘swallow’ as 2nd member, hence ‘powerfully swallowing’ vel sim. But to a seṭ
root we should probably expect *-gira- (like -tír-: -tira-; (-)túr-: túra-). I follow
instead a suggestion of Insler’s, that it represents a haplologized *tuvi-vigrá-
‘powerfully spirited’.
With most, I take śyénī as the fem. of the color term śyetá-, rather than, with
Ge, as the fem. of śyená- ‘falcon’ (Adlerweibchen). Among other things, we would
probably expect the fem. of ‘falcon’ to have vṛkī́- inflection, like vṛkī́- itself and
siṃhī́- ‘lioness’ to siṃhá- ‘lion’; it should therefore have suffixal accent, and in this
sandhi context the nom. sg. should have come out as *śyenī́ḥ. Moreover there is no
obvious role for a female falcon in context. The white trail of ash here contrasts
nicely with the black furrows (kṛṣṇásīta-) the fire creates in 4b.</p>
<h3 id="i14010">I.140.10</h3>
<p>I read pāda b with cd, contrary to the standard tr., which take it as
independent. I might, however, replace the tr. of ádha as ‘then’ with ‘and’ or the like.
The first word of c, avā́s
i
ya, is generally taken as the gerund to áva √as lit.
‘throw down’. I am dubious about this interpr., since that lexeme is not found
elsewhere in the RV or, acdg. to Monier Williams, anywhere else in Sanskrit. I
therefore derive it rather from áva √sā / si ‘let loose, unhitch’, despite the formal
difficulties. The idiom is used regularly for letting loose horses, to which Agni’s
flames are compared here, and see X.61.20, where Agni is the subject of áva syati, a
verse that contains vocabulary that resonates here: dvivartaní- and śíśu-. The
problem is that we should expect avasā́ya with full-grade root and root accent (cf.
I.104.1) or possibly *avasi
yà (this zero-gr. form is recorded in Whitney’s Roots). I
can only explain the accented long vowel in avā́s
i
ya as arising from confusion
produced by augmented forms (cf. ávāsuḥ ‘they unhitched’ I.179.2).
I take the śíśumatīḥ ‘(females) possessing young’ to be Agni’s flames; they
have young because flames beget more flames as they spread.
I take d as a paradox: the fire is in constant circling motion (parijárbhurāṇaḥ),
but still produces a protective encirclement like armor.</p>
<h3 id="i14011">I.140.11</h3>
<p>Most take the expression in b to mean “let it be dearer to you than a dear
thought”; this seems to me nonsensical or at least rhetorically weak. I suggest that
there is a pun on priyá-, which can mean both ‘dear’ and ‘own’. Here the poet
suggests that his composed thought will be dearer to Agni than anything the god
himself might produce.</p>
<h3 id="i14012">I.140.12</h3>
<p>See publ. intro. for speculation on the “foot” of the boat.
Ge suggests persuasively that “chariot and house” are used metaphorically for
(times of) war and peace.</p>
<h3 id="i14013">I.140.13</h3>
<p>The problem in this verse is to determine which pādas go together. Ge and
Re construe ab and cd together, but this leads to a gender problem: the subj. of cd
should be fem. pl. aruṇyàḥ in d, but c contains a nom. pl. masc. part. yántaḥ. (Old
[SBE] suggests that this form is corrupt because of the metrical problems in the pāda;
he treats these at length in Noten, but does not seem to favor emendation of the
participle.) The problem is not entirely solved by taking c with (a)b, as Old (SBE)
and I do, but it becomes somewhat attenuated by the variety of possible subjects:
Agni (m.), Heaven and Earth (dyā́vā-kṣā́mā, dual dvandva, whose gender is listed by
Gr. as fem., but there are no diagnostic passages), the rivers (síndhu-, sometimes
fem., sometimes masc. [see common acc. pl. síndhūn]) &ndash; with masc. prevailing either
because masc. is the default in such gender clashes or because síndhavaḥ is the
closest subject to yántaḥ. WG also take d with the nominatives of b, by somehow
taking aruṇyàḥ as a temporal expression “bei den (Morgen)röten,” but one would
expect a loc. for this meaning (as opposed to the extent of time in the temporal
dīrghā́hā “through the long days” of c).</p>
<h3 id="i141">I.141</h3>
<p>Agni
See published intro. for discussion of enjambement and other special effects
in this hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i1411">I.141.1</h3>
<p>Most tr. take the subj. of úpa hvarate to be the same as that of sā́dhate,
namely the thought (matíḥ), and therefore must take the subord. cl. as concessive
(more or less “even if / although it moves crookedly, it goes straight …”). However,
I take Agni as the subj. of úpa hvarate, which expresses the usual crooked motion of
fire, and the īm in this clause as standing for matíḥ, the subj. of the main clause and
the goal of úpa hvarate. (īm and sīm almost always have real accusative reference;
see Jamison 2002, Fs. Cardona, and īm in 3a and 3c below.) The verbs do of course
contrast &ndash; the zigzaging motion of the fire as opposed to the straight path of the
poetic thought &ndash; but this is the result of the different natures of their two subjects,
which are acting in tandem for the success of the sacrifice. That hvārá- is used of
Agni in 7b supports taking him as subj. of hvárate here. However, see comment in</p>
<h3 id="i1424">I.142.4</h3>
<p>below.
Most tr. take the streams of truth (ṛtásya dhénā(ḥ)) as acc. pl. and the object
of anayanta, and supply various subjects: e.g., Ge “wise ones” (dhī́rāḥ), largely on
the basis of V.45.10, which has dhī́rāḥ as subj. of anayanta. Since that passage in a
Viśve Devāḥ hymn has no other points of contact with ours, I see no reason to supply
an otherwise unrepresented subject here and to bump the possible surface subj., fem.
pl. dhénāḥ, into the acc. I would adduce rather I.148.3 (also Dīrghatamas), where
Agni is the obj. of prá … nayanta, as I think he is here. It is true that I.146.4 has
dhī́rāsaḥ … kaváyaḥ “clever poets,” who guide (nayanti) Agni’s step (padám), which
would give a nearer parallel for the dhī́rāḥ supplied here by Ge (who oddly doesn&rsquo;t
cite this nearby passage), but the phrase “streams of truth,” that is, true poetic
formulations, seems to me just another way to refer to “clever poets” and actually
supports taking the fem. pl. expression as the subj. and Agni as obj.</p>
<h3 id="i1412-1">I.141.2</h3>
<p>This verse concerns the three forms of Agni, with “form” expressed by neut.
vápuḥ in a, which should be supplied with dvitī́yam in b and tṛtī́yam in c. (Contra Ge
[/WG], who take vápuḥ as an adjective and the ordinals as adverbs. Since vápuṣe is
clearly nominal in 1a, an adjectival usage in the following vs. would be surprising,
esp. as there are, in my opinion, no certain exx. of adjectival vápus-.)
In a I take pṛkṣáḥ as the gen. sg. of pṛ́kṣ-, rather than the nom. sg. of pṛkṣá-
(so Gr, Old [SBE], Ge, WG) or acc. pl. of pṛ́kṣ- (so Re). It is a descriptive or
qualifying gen.: the “wondrous form of nourishment.” It is not entirely clear what this
phrase refers to, but I would suggest that it is the plants, which are often said to
contain the fire in embryonic form (thus wondrously). In this form he is “abounding
in food” both because the plants feed the fire and because plants supply nourishment
to the living world. Such a qualifying gen. is also found in vṛṣabhásya in c acdg. to
my interpr. (but not those of others). The root noun pṛ́kṣ- is probably found also in
pṛkṣúdh- in vs. 4 below, qualifying plants (vīrúdhaḥ), which supports my interpr.
here.
The second wondrous form is the fire in the waters, which has come to be
identified with Apām Napāt. The “sevenfold-kindly (saptáśivāsu) mothers” must be
the seven streams. The compound is oddly formed, and Gr, inter alia, suggests
reading *saptá *śivā́su, an unnecessary emendation, particularly if we maintain the
compound reading of dáśapramatim in d (see immed. below).
The third form of fire, presented in cd, appears to be the ritual fire produced
by the kindling sticks wielded by the fingers, which are characterized, as so often, as
“young women” (yóṣaṇaḥ). The cmpd. dáśapramatim ‘having ten(fold) forethought’
suffers from the same formational oddity as saptáśivāsu and has been even more
eagerly emended to *dáśa *prámatim (see, e.g., Old, Noten, who keeps saptáśivāsu
as a cmpd but supports emending the other to two words). The dáśa, liberated from
the compound, would qualify the fingers, as often. However, in my opinion we must
keep either both compounds or neither, and since the cmpds are the more difficult
readings and Dīrghatamas is a tricky poet, I see no reason to emend.
Note that janayanta in b rhymes with anayanta in 1d in the same metrical
position.</p>
<h3 id="i1413">I.141.3</h3>
<p>This verse describes several mystical and, probably, mythical productions of
fire, couched in the present (clear pres. mathāyáti in d, which suggests that the injunc.
kránta in b has the same temporal value). I do not completely understand either of
the scenarios, esp. fire’s hiding in the mixing vessel in cd.
Ge’s suggestion that the first hemistich deals with Agni in the waters is
supported by the parallel passages he adduces, and so it may continue the theme of
2b.
In d mathāyáti is entirely ambiguous between ‘churns, rubs’ (Old [SBE]
‘produces … by attrition’, Ge ‘ausreibt’) and ‘steals’ (Re, WG), and both are
appropriate: ‘churns’ would continue the theme of fire-production, but ‘steals’ would
refer to Mātariśvan’s theft of fire from heaven. No doubt both are meant, and there is
both a mythical and a ritual application of the passage. Cf. I.148.1 máthīt …
mātariśvā.</p>
<h3 id="i1414">I.141.4</h3>
<p>This vs. concerns the production of fire by the friction of the two kindling
sticks.
His “highest father” (pitúḥ paramā́t) is probably Heaven (Dyaus Pitar), as
most take it; it also contrasts with the “depth” (budhnā́t) that is his source in 3a. The
pāda-final pári is probably not to be construed with the verb (prá) nīyate, though pári
is common with √nī, but, as often, governs the abl. (pitúḥ paramā́t), despite the
intercalation of the verb between the abl. phrase and this postposition.
The hapax pṛkṣúdh- in b is variously explained. E.g., Old (Noten) suggests
that it is modeled on the immediately following vīrúdh- and also śurúdh-. In the
published tr. I followed Humbach’s explanation (Gathas [1st ed. 1958] II.28; accepted
by Narten, YH p. 161), which takes -udh as a zero-grade root noun belonging to
widespread PIE *√uedh ̯ ‘convey’, otherwise unattested in Indo-Aryan. But I now no
longer believe that etymology (see my forthcoming art. “Vedic iṣudhyá- and Old
Avestan išud-, išūidiia-: The Aim of Praise”), and I would now follow Old’s
suggestion. Note the progression and phonetic play in the pāda: ā́pṛkṣudho vīrúdho
dáṃsu rohati. I would also slightly change the published tr. from “nourishmentbringing” to “nourishing.”
On dáṃsu see I.134.4. As noted there, I take it as a loc. pl. to the root noun
dám- ‘house’ (so Old [SBE], tentatively Ge, WG), rather than as an adverbial deriv.
of √daṃs ‘be wondrous’ (Gr, Re). Here it presumably refers to the domestic fire
established in the house(s); since words for ‘house’ in the plural often refer to only a
single domestic establishment (presumably because it is made up of several
buildings), “in the house” rather than the publ. “in the houses” is also possible.
Pāda c contains a curiously doubled yád in a single clause (ubhā́yád asya
janúṣaṃ yád ínvataḥ), which has attracted little attention. Old (SBE) notes it but
makes no attempt to explain it, and otherwise the standard tr. (including mine) do not
reflect or mention it. The exception is WG, who take the pāda as a kind of stuttering
set of false starts: “Wenn die beiden seine Geburt &ndash; wenn (sie überhaupt) &ndash;
antreiben.” This seems to be the only way to represent what the text has, since it is
impossible to manufacture a separate clause dependent on the second yád. But since
both clauses in the WG rendering share subject, object, and verb, and the adverbial
addition “überhaupt” reflects nothing in the Skt., it may be just as well to pass over
the doubling in silence, assuming that the second yád comes from the occasional
tendency for the relatively pronoun to immediately precede a pāda-final verb. Cf.,
e.g., for this verb stem, I.55.4d kṣémeṇa dhénām maghávā yád ínvati (also V.28.2c,
VIII.13.32c … yám ínvasi).
Pāda d contains an augmented impf. abhavat, which contrasts with the
presents nīyáte (a), róhati (b), and ínvataḥ (c), esp. since it begins ā́d íd “just after
that,” which suggests that the past tense action of d should follow the actions of the
earlier part of the verse. Most tr. (Old [SBE], Ge, Re, WG) take c and d together,
separate from ab, which produces a jarring sequence of tense: “when they spur on …,
then he became …” I connect c rather with ab and indeed with vs. 3 and start a new
syntactic sequence with 4d, which is continued by the preterital expressions ā́d íd +
ā́viśat in 5a, ví vāvrdhe ̥ in 5b, and áruhat in 5c. Although this is not a complete
solution, in that the ā́d íd “just after that” of 4d and 5a begs for a sequentially prior
preterite, it keeps the disharmonious sequence of tenses from inhabiting the same
sentence. This division is also compatible with the syntactic enjambement
characteristic of the hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i1415">I.141.5</h3>
<p>The mothers (mātṝ́ḥ) of pāda a contrast with the father (pitúḥ) of 4a.
The standard tr. take ví vāvṛdhe in b as the verb of a rel. cl. begun by yā́su in a.
The problem is that vāvṛdhe is not accented. Ge suggests that it lacks accent because
the rel. pronoun is in a different pāda, but this separation does not pose problems
elsewhere (cf., simply within this hymn, 3ab nír yád …, … kránta, 3cd yád …, …
mathāyáti, 6cd … yád …, … véti); Old is in favor of emending to vivāvṛdhé. Taking
the text as given, I construe the rel. clause with yā́su as a nominal locational clause;
similarly (but independently) WG with a different distribution of elements. It is true
that there are several yā́su √vrdh̥ passages; cf. esp. II.13.1 … apáḥ … ā́viśad yā́su
várdhate “he [=Indra] entered the waters, within whom he grows strong” (cf. V.44.1),
but I think we must take the lack of verbal accent more seriously than these few
phraseological parallels.
Again, contrary to most, I attach c to ab and take d separately, on the basis of
the distribution of verb tenses.</p>
<h3 id="i1416">I.141.6</h3>
<p>Another instance of ā́d íd, which seems, in this hymn, to mark the progress
of the ritual.
With bhágam iva papṛcā́nāsaḥ in b compare bhágam … papṛcāsi in 11b. The
difference of voice is significant: in 6b the mortal officiants “(en)gorge themselves
(med.) with/on good fortune” while in 11 Agni engorges (i.e., swells)(act.) good
fortune for us.” The similarity of these striking expressions makes it unlikely that
bhágam in 6b is primarily the goal/object of ṛñjate, as Ge, Re, WG take it.
The phrase mártaṃ śáṃsam may be a de-compounded version of nárāśáṃsawith lexical substitution. Note that nárāśáṃsa- is found in the next hymn, the Āprī
hymn I.142.3. See also devā́nāṃ śā́ṃsam in 11d of this hymn. The double object of
véti &ndash; devā́n and mártaṃ śáṃsam &ndash; is a zeugma of sorts, made possible by the fact
that √vī can take both animate and inanimate objects.</p>
<h3 id="i1417">I.141.7</h3>
<p>I take this entire verse as dependent on vs. 6. It is full of rare and unclear
words, but the pile-up of descriptors of the violently moving fire is exhilarating.
In b hvārá- (to √hvar ‘move crookedly, twist’; cf. hvárate in 1c) is taken by
Ge and Re as ‘bird’, but I am persuaded by Roth’s suggestion, enshrined in Gr (and
see Old [Noten]), that the referent is a snake &ndash; the creature of “twisting/serpentine
motion.” The quality held in common between the hvārá and fire is vákva-, derived
from the root √vañc ‘undulate, curl, meander’, and the image is that of fire winding
its way through the dried-up plants that serve as its fuel. From this tr. it is clear that I
take jaráṇā as jaráṇāḥ, with the Pp., and as an acc. pl. fem. ‘old (things = plants’). Gr.
identifies it as an instr. sg., and this interpr. is followed by others (most recently by
WG), but the sandhi situation, with -ā before a- essentially excludes it (though see
Old [Noten] who finds it barely possible).
The sense of ánākṛta- is likewise unclear, though its formation is transparent.
The tr. of Old (SBE “whom it is not possible to drive to a place”; sim. Noten), Ge
(“ohne Antrieb”), Re (“sans y avoir été poussé”) seem to reflect a sense of the
common idiom ā́√kṛ ‘bring here’ extended to ‘push/force (here)’, with the ‘here’
elided. However, in his n. 7b, Ge adduces PB XXIII.13.4.5, which concerns wild
animals that are anākṛta-. Caland tr. ‘unfostered’, but I see another possible
extension of ‘brought here’, namely ‘kept here’ à ‘confined’, with its negative then
‘unconfined’. This certainly fits the PB passage and also matches Sāy’s gloss
anivāritaḥ (Ge’s tr. ‘ungehemmt’).
The second hemistich is entirely couched in the gen., save for the loc. pátman
‘flight’ off which all those genitives hang. I construe pátman with ánākṛtaḥ in b.
Although ‘flight’ may seem to support the ‘bird’ interpr. of hvārá- in b, note that
hvārá- is in a simile syntactically independent of the rest of the sentence; moreover,
Dīrghatamas hardly feels constrained to confine himself to one image at a time.
dakṣúṣaḥ is a pseudo-perfect-participle, like the pseudo-desiderative-adjective
dákṣu- (II.4.4) to √dah ‘burn’. Both are hapaxes.
On -jaṃhas- see comm. ad VI.12.2 and VI.3.5.
vyàdhvan- can contain either ví ‘without’ or ví ‘through, wide(ly)’ (so also
Old [SBE], Re). I have opted for the latter, but others (Ge ‘wegelosen Flug’, WG
‘Wegelosen’) for the former. Either would work, though the phrase rája ā́seems to
me to express extent of space and to favor my interpr.</p>
<h3 id="i1418">I.141.8</h3>
<p>What quality of a chariot is expressed by the ppl. yātá- to √yā ‘drive’ is
unclear. Because of the phrase “made by dexterous (men),” which seems to refer to
the chariot as object rather than to its current situation, I suggest that it’s a particular
type of chariot, perhaps one made for long journeys. But it is also possible that it
refers to the current situation, in which case it could mean “like a driven chariot” (i.e.,
one that is speeding).
Pāda c is full of difficulties, esp. the unaccented dakṣi and the semantically
anomalous sūráyaḥ ‘patrons’. There is also the question whether the pāda is
syntactically independent or forms a clause with d. With Ge (but contra most other
interpr.) I take cd together. Otherwise pāda c would be a nominal clause of some sort,
but the introductory ā́d (recalling ā́d íd of 5a, 6a) seems to call for a dynamic verb.
As for the “black patrons” I take this to be, as it were, a two-part phrase: “black” first
refers to the plumes of smoke, picking up kṛṣṇájaṃhas- ‘having black plumage’ in
7c; the clouds of smoke surrounding the fire are then implicitly likened to the
sacrificial patrons who would gather around the ritual fire.
What then to do with dakṣi? Two main solutions are found in the lit.: it is a 2nd
sg. impv. (or si-imperative) to √dah ‘burn’ as it is in II.1.10 (Re), or it is a voc. of a
nominal stem of unclear formation likewise built to √dah (Old, WG). Ge refuses to tr.
and AiG II.1.408 floats both possibilities. The first (impv.) has the merit of matching
an actual existing form, but otherwise has little to recommend it. In particular, if it
forms a parenthetical independent clause it should be accented. The second (voc.)
does not create syntactic problems but leaves the question of the morphology
unresolved. I do not favor either of them, because either one requires 2nd ps.
reference, which I think would violate the structure of the hymn. As noted in the publ.
intro., the first 8 verses are couched entirely in the 3rd person describing the fire and
entirely lack the word agní-; both the 2nd ps. and agní- are forcefully introduced at
the beginning of vs. 9 (tváyā hy àgne), and this 2nd ps. address prevails in the next
three vss. (9–11). I find it difficult to believe that the wily Dīrghatamas would spoil
his schematic division by introducing a muddled 2nd person in vs. 8. Moreover, the
asya in 8c surely has Agni as its referent, which should probably preclude a 2nd ps.
reference to him in the same pāda. Unfortunately I do not have an acceptable solution
to dakṣi, however. With the others I take it as an unclearly formed nominal derivative
of √dah, but as the 1st member of a tatpuruṣa with sūrí-, hence ‘the patron(s) of the
burning one’, but this is a solution of desperation and carries no conviction.
The grammar of d is scarcely less contorted than that of c. The verb īṣate
belongs to a clear thematic stem and should therefore of course be 3rd sg., but the
apparent subject, váyaḥ, is ordinarily a nom. pl. ‘birds’ to the stem ví-. To make the
grammar work, it needs to be interpreted as a neut. s-stem collective in the nom. sg.
(‘bird flesh, poultry’; cf. Re’s ‘la gent-ailée’), a formation that is found later (already
AV) but not otherwise in the RV. Moreover, if pāda c is to be construed with d, its pl.
subj. kṛṣṇā́saḥ … sūráyaḥ also clashes in number with the verb īṣate. My somewhat
uneasy solution to this is to assume that váyaḥ here has been reinterpreted as a
singular collective and, as the noun closest to the verb, has determined the number of
the verb. But since váyaḥ refers to the collectivity of birds, the pl. kṛṣṇā́saḥ …
sūráyaḥ can match it in sense and therefore function as subj. of īṣate as well.
(Another possible solution is to assume that īṣate has been assimilated to the
athematic formations of similar shape, ī́rte, ī́rate and, esp., the near rhyme ī́ṣṭe, ī́śate,
with 3rd plural in -ate. This does not seem impossible to me, esp. since their 1st sgs. in
-e would coincide.)
The publ. tr. reflects a double reading of initial śū́rasya ‘of a champion’ with
partial emendation to *sū́ryasya / sū́raḥ ‘of the sun’ in its 2nd reading. In my view, the
juxtaposition across pāda boundary of sūráyaḥ and śū́rasya was designed to bring to
mind a third term, the sun, sharing its initial with sūráyah, its gen. case with śū́rasya,
and its -ūr- with both. Though the patrons might shrink from the attack of a
champion, birds are more likely to shrink from the flaring of the sun, either retreating
from its heat or avoiding flying too high and therefore too near it. This double
reading helps unify the two-part NP of c, the black (plumes) = patrons, and takes us
back to the flight of the bird Agni in 7cd.</p>
<h3 id="i1419">I.141.9</h3>
<p>After the extravagances of the last few vss., this vs. brings us back to earth
and opens the last section of the hymn, addressing Agni and praising his benefits.
The morphological and phraseological parallelism of vibhúḥ (c) and paribhū́ḥ
(d) are difficult to convey in tr. On the basis of the viśváthā ‘everywhere’ with the
former and the passages containing víśvā (…) paribhū́- (I.91.19, II.24.11, III.3.10), I
have supplied ‘everything’ with the latter (so also Ge, WG; sim. Old [SBE]).
As in I.37.9 I construe ánu with preceding sīm “following them.”</p>
<h3 id="i14110">I.141.10</h3>
<p>dhīmahi in d is probably has a slight double meaning: we want to acquire
Agni like good fortune, but in the technical ritual sense we want to install / establish
him. For the technical sense see dádhānaḥ in 13b.
There is also a pun on bhága-, both ‘good fortune’ and the name of the god, a
pun continued in the next vs.</p>
<h3 id="i14111">I.141.11</h3>
<p>Ge (also Kü 306) takes pāda a separately from b and supplies ‘give’, but
this seems entirely unnecessary.
For bhágam √pṛc, see comments ad 6b. bhága- also participates in a nexus
with the previous verse: in 10d it appears in a simile, but here it has been promoted
to the “real” object to which other entities are compared. In the first hemistich the
common noun usage of the stem is dominant, but in the 2nd it is the god Bhaga.
Contrary to Ge (/WG/Kü) but with Old (SBE) and Re, I take dámūnasam as
an adj. with rayím rather than as an independent nominal referring to the master of
the house (Ge ‘Hausgebieter’).
Note devā́nāṃ śáṃsam here matching mártaṃ śáṃsam in 6d. As there, the
object of the verb yámati here involves a zeugma, of animates (the races of gods and
men) and the inanimate laud of the gods.
The last clausal tag in d, ṛtá ā́ca sukrátuḥ could simply be taken as a nominal
sentence with copula to be supplied (“and he is of good resolve in truth” vel sim.).
However, I supply a passive form of √yam (presumably ppl. yatáḥ) corresponding to
the act. subj. yámati of c. Cf., for ṛtá ā́, VI.7.1 r̥tá ā́jātám “born in truth” and, for
yatá- + LOC, VIII.92.7 víśvāsu gīrṣv ā́yatam “held in place amidst all your hymns”
(also V.44.9). I recognize that this extra material may be unnecessary, however. On
the other hand, see comm. on I.144.3 for possible support.</p>
<h3 id="i14112">I.141.12</h3>
<p>The acc. goals in d, vāmáṃ suvitáṃ vásyaḥ, may be a triplet (with vāmám
and suvitám separate; so Ge, Re, WG); it is not easy to tell and has little effect on
sense.
The hapax splv. néṣatama-, to the unattested a-stem *néṣa-, is generally taken
as agentive (‘best leader[s]’; e.g., Ge “mit den besten Führen”), but I see no reason
for this. The expression seems parallel to II.23.4 sunītíbhir nayasi &ldquo;you guide with
good guidance,&rdquo; X.63.13 náyathā sunītíbhiḥ, where agentive readings are out. (Note
that in both passages the abstract is in the plural, as here.) Moreover, since Agni is
doing the leading, he would not need additional leaders (though WG suggest that
they are the horses in pāda a). In any case note the ring with anayanta in 1d.</p>
<h3 id="i14113">I.141.13</h3>
<p>The arkaíḥ of pāda a can refer both to the chants of the ritual participants
and to Agni’s flames, though only the first sense is registered by most tr. In the
second sense the instr. is not an agentive/instrumental phrase with passive ástāvi, but
an instr. of accompaniment/description.
The “further forward” (pratarám) of b presumably refers to the installation of
the new Āhavanīya fire, carried towards the east. The dádhānaḥ of this pāda forms a
ring with dhāyi of 1a.
In cd the mixed 3rd and 1st ps. pl. subject amī́ca yé maghávāno vayáṃ ca
“both those who are our bounteous (patrons) and we (ourselves)” takes a 3rd pl. verb,
níṣ ṭatanyuḥ. I take níḥ with the frame (“extend outward”) and áti with the simile
(“extend beyond”).</p>

<p>mátiḥ … vacyáte “the thought is twisting its way” gives potential support to
the interpretation of úpa hvarate in the previous hymn I.141.1 as having matíḥ as its
subj. (contrary to my view), but the other considerations raised ad loc. weigh more
strongly for me. As for vacyáte, the “passive” accentuation of this apparently intrans.
verb of motion is treated at length by Kulikov (-ya-presents, pp. 218–23), who
acknowledges the standard functional interpr. of this pres. but attempts (rather too
ingeniously in my view) to take it as originally passive (“is being directed towards
you” in his tr.). Since √vañc seems to me to express precisely non-direct(ed) action,
this interpr. does not capture the sense. I do not have a good explanation of the suffix
accent, beyond noting that there are other non-passive medial -yá- formations, most
notably mriyáte ‘dies’, that have failed to retract the accent.</p>
<h3 id="i1425">I.142.5</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) treat this verse as containing an anacoluthon, with the plural pres.
part. stṛṇānā́saḥ modifying the 1st singular pres. vṛñjé: “(We) strewing …, I twist …”
This seems unnecessary to me. I take the participle as predicated in a main clause,
with the vṛñjé clause parallel: “They … are strewing the ritual grass; I twist (the
grass) …” Although predicated present participles are much rarer than their past
participle equivalents, they are not non-existent: the commentary so far as identified
a fair number of examples that can be so interpr. and whose alternative
interpretations are forced.

<h3 id="i143-1">I.143</h3>
<p>Agni
I.143.2, 4: The two examples of majmánā (2c, 4b), both characterizing Agni (in my
opinion), should have been rendered in the same way in the publ. tr., rather than as
by “might” and “greatness” respectively.</p>
<h3 id="i1433">I.143.3</h3>
<p>The bahuvrīhi bhā́tvakṣasaḥ in c is generally taken as a gen. sg., modifying
Agni, who is amply represented by genitives in b and in the two forms of asyá in a. I
prefer to take it as a nom. pl. modifying the beams (bhānávaḥ) that remain the
subject of the sentence. However, either interpr. is possible.
The rest of pāda c presents other difficulties: it contains two apparent
nominatives, sg. aktúḥ and pl. síndhavaḥ, both apparently part of the same simile.
Moreover the prep./prev. áti has nothing to govern or construe with. Old allows an
emendation to acc. pl. *aktū́n, producing the prep. phrase áti *aktū́n “across the
nights,” which produces good sense. Ge refines this by suggesting that there is really
a word haplology from *áty aktúm aktúr, with aktúr and síndhavaḥ forming what he
calls elsewhere a loose karmadhāraya, tr. “gleich dem Farbenspiel der Flüsse” (sim.
Re “comme la surface-ointe (des) fleuves”). Since both also render the haplologized
*aktúm/aktū́n as ‘night(s)’, they are also silently assuming a pun on aktú-, both ‘night’
and a derivative of √añj ‘anoint, adorn’. My interpr. also assumes a haplology of
*aktū́n (or aktúm), in order to account for the áti, which several times appears with
an acc. of a word for ‘night’ (VI.4.5 … áty ety aktū́n; cf. also áty aktúbhiḥ with instr.
I.36.16; with acc. pl. kṣapáḥ VIII.26.3, X.77.2). For aktúḥ, however, I suggest very
tentatively that we are dealing with a gen. sg. to a (pseudo-)-(t)ar-stem to the ‘night’
word (see Nomen in idg. Lex. 505 for a few apparent r-stem forms elsewhere) &ndash;
hence, “the rivers of the night.” If this morphological suggestion seems too radical,
the “loose karmadhāraya” interpr. of two nominatives might produce the same effect.
In any case, the expression is reminiscent of the curious phrase aktúr apā́m “the
‘night’ of the waters” in II.30.1.</p>
<h3 id="i1435">I.143.5</h3>
<p>senā́- can mean either ‘weapon’ or ‘army’. Despite the publ. tr. (and most
other tr.), ‘weapon’ might work better with aśániḥ ‘missile’ than ‘army’.</p>
<h3 id="i1436">I.143.6</h3>
<p>The verb āvárat in b is morphologically problematic. Given the context, its
root affiliation is surely to √vṛ ‘choose’ rather than to √vṛ ‘obstruct, hinder’ (despite
nearby várāya [5a] belonging to the latter). But forms to √vṛ ‘choose’ are
overwhelmingly medial &ndash; save for a tiny collection of forms resembling this one,
with the preverb ā́, full-grade of the root, an apparent thematic vowel (which is more
likely the subjunctive marker), and act. endings: āváraḥ VIII.13.21, 19.30. In the
publ. tr. I render both as “you (will) choose,” but it is possible that “you (will) grant”
would be better. The answer depends on what gave rise to these active forms. By one
scenario we might view them as contrastive actives generated to the middle,
specifically the middle root aorist found in a few forms like (ā́…) ava
ri (IV.55.5). In
that case the complementary reciprocal active sense to medial ‘chose’ would be
‘grant’. However, this is another possible pathway to the act. forms, suggested by
Dīrghatamas’s own usage. In I.140.13 the final VP is íṣaṃ váram &hellip; varanta, which I
tr. “they will choose refreshment as their boon (for us?).” varanta is a well-formed
3rd pl. med. subj. to the root aorist; however, because of its -anta ending it could have
been interpr. as an -anta replacment to an active form (*varan) of the same meaning
(for -anta replacements see Jamison 1979 [IIJ 21]). On this interpr., further act.
forms could have been generated to this supposed act. stem. Although this
explanation might work best for the form in this hymn (as opposed to those in VIII)
because it is also a Dīrghatamas product, the problem is that our form here pretty
clearly means ‘grant’ not ‘choose’, as the scenario would suggest. (Unless of course
varanta in I.140.13 actually does mean ‘grant’, which is not impossible.) In short,
these forms are morphologically puzzling and their meaning(s) not entirely clear.</p>
<h3 id="i1438">I.143.8</h3>
<p>With most interpr., I take unaccented iṣṭe at the end of c, also found at the
end of its pāda in VI.8.7, as a voc. to a -ti-stem, built to √iṣ ‘seek’. Although such a
form and usage is unusual, Ge’s suggestion, that it is truncated from *iṣtébhiḥ (Ge
‘lieben’), seems less likely. See Old’s scathing criticism of the same emendation ad
VI.8.7 in ZDMG 55.296 (=KlSch. 755).</p>
<h3 id="i144-1">I.144</h3>
<p>Agni</p>
<h3 id="i1443">I.144.3</h3>
<p>This verse contains a number of elements reminiscent of I.140 and I.141.
E.g., Agni’s wondrous form (vápuḥ) is found also in 141.1, 2; the repeated transverse
movement of the kindling sticks, expressed by the intensive part. vitáritratā here,
echoes tarete in 140.3; and bhága- reprises the numerous exx. of that stem in 141 (6b,
10d, 11b). The opening of c, ā́d īm, reminds us of the ritual-ordering expression ā́d íd
in 140 (4d, 5a, 6a; cf. simply ā́d in 8c). The īm in our pāda c is functionless; that is,
there is no possible acc. role it can fill in its clause, and it may have been substituted
for *íd because of the 2nd position īm opening the next two verses (4a yád īm, 5a tám
īm).
I differ from the standard tr. in my interpr. of the rest of cd. The others divide
the two clauses at the pāda boundary, with sám asmád ā́belonging with the rest of c.
This would of course be the default syntactic division. However, this assumes that
sám is construed with hávyaḥ ‘to be invoked’. But √hū is not otherwise combined
with sám, and moreover preverbs should be univerbated with gerundives (e.g.,
vihávya- II.18.7). To my mind, the material beginning with sám asmád ā́belongs
with d, and the sám that opens it is repeated right before the verb in d (sám ayaṃsta).
This repetition indicates a complicated structure, and, in my opinion, the whole also
bears a complicated relationship to 141.11. The repeated sám signals two different
uses of the verb sám ayaṃsta. The first is transitive, with ‘reins’ as object (vóḷhur ná
raśmī́n “… (as if) holding firm the reins of a draught-horse”), and it matches the
similar expression in 141.11 raśmī́ṃ̐r iva yó yámati “who will hold [them] fast like
reins,” though with a different voice, tense stem, and mood of √yam. The voice
difference is crucial, because act. yámati in 141.11 can only be transitive, whereas
med. ayaṃsta admits both transitive (as in the simile here) and passive
interpretations; for the latter, see nearby I.136.2 pánthā ṛtásya sám ayaṃsta
raśmíbhiḥ. And that is what I think is found in the frame of this passage: Agni, who
is compared to a chariot-driver actively holding the reins in the simile, is in turn held
by us in the frame, with a rare but not unprecedented abl. agent asmád ā́with the
passive sense of ayaṃsta. In other words, this is another example of case disharmony
in similes of the type discussed in my 1982 article (IIJ 24). Taking ayaṃsta as
passive in the frame also avoids the problem of the lack of second object parallel to
‘reins’, which the various tr. struggle with and mostly deal with by supplying ‘reins’
a second time.
Now recall that in 141.11 I wanted to see a similar passive value in the final
tag ṛtá ā́ca sukrátuḥ “and (who himself), of good resolve, (is held fast) in truth.” To
achieve this, I had to supply (that is, invent) a passive form of √yam, namely the ppl.
yatáḥ to contrast with act. transitive yámati. But in 144.3, because of the dual value
of ayaṃsta, both transitive and passive, it is not necessary to supply anything, but
simply to read the verb twice, once each with each occurrence of sám. I therefore
think that 144.3 reinforces my interpr. of 141.11 and that, in turn, 141.11 supports
my double reading of 144.3.
Note that Old in SBE follows the syntactic division at pāda boundary in our
3cd, but in the Noten explicitly changes his view, taking asmád ā́with what follows
as I do. I cannot follow his interpr. thereof, however: “Agni lenkt die Fahrt zu uns
hin.”
I.144.3–4: The pair sávayasā ‘of the same vigor’ in these two verses have been
variously identified: Sāy, Old (SBE, by implication), Hotar and Adhvaryu; Ge, Re,
the two arms of the fire churner. I think it rather to be the two kindling sticks. As
noted above, the dual participle in vitáritratā 3b here reminds us of the dual verb
tarete in I.140.3, whose subj. is, by consensus, the two kindling sticks. In that same
passage they are described as sakṣítā ‘sharing the same abode’, which matches
samāné yónā … sámokasā “in the same womb … sharing the same dwelling” in our
4b.</p>
<h3 id="i1444">I.144.4</h3>
<p>The phrase dívā ná náktam is universally taken as “by night as by day” (that
is, “always,” as Sāy points out), with a very extended sense of the simile marker ná. I
take ná rather as the homonymous negative: “by day, not by night.” This would
reflect the simple fact that the ritual fire is kindled only in the morning and draw
attention to the oddity of this practice, since in everyday terms fire is more needed
and desired at night, for light and warmth. The position of ná allows either interpr.: it
is in expected 2nd position for a simile, but in my interpr. it immediately precedes the
word it negates, which is standard when ná is not a sentential negation, but negates a
single word in a clause.
I render the verb in this clause as preterital, in keeping with the Pp. reading
yúvā ajani. However, to match the presential saparyátaḥ of pāda a and the generality
of the statement about his birth it would be possible to read (without emending the
Saṃhitā text) yuvā jani, with an injunctive, which could have presential/timeless
sense: “he is born …”</p>
<h3 id="i1445">I.144.5</h3>
<p>vríś- is a hapax, but the generally accepted meaning ‘finger’ seems well
supported by context. Though suggested etymological connections do not enforce
this sense, they do allow it. See EWA II.597 and lit. referred to there.
In 5d I have followed the Pp. and tr. augmented adhita; however, as in 4c the
sequence návādhita could be read návā dhita with injunc., which would have
presential/timeless value to match the presents hinvanti (a), havāmahe (b), and ṛṇvati
(c). Although no other unaug. dhita forms occur, there is no reason it should not exist.</p>
<h3 id="i1446">I.144.6</h3>
<p>Opinion is divided over whether the two females of cd are Heaven and Earth
or Night and Dawn. On the one hand, the heavenly and earthly realms of ab seem to
favor the former pair; on the other, Heaven and Earth are not easily movable and
would find it difficult to come physically to the ritual ground. (On this issue see
Jamison, Staal Mem. Vol., 2016].) Night and Dawn might make better sense, in that
the kindling of the ritual fire occurs at their temporal intersection and so they might
appear to be both present at that moment. For such a sentiment see I.146.3. vákvarī
‘surging, undulating’ is also a more likely epithet of Night and Dawn (with their
changing light) than of Heaven and Earth. Remember Agni’s beams churning “like
the rivers of the night” in the immed. preceding hymn I.143.3.</p>
<h3 id="i145">I.145</h3>
<p>Agni</p>
<h3 id="i1451">I.145.1</h3>
<p>I take the two occurrences of īyate in b as passives to √yā ‘implore, beseech’
(with putative underlying accent īyáte)(so also WG), not to ī́yate ‘speeds’ as most do.
This echoes tám pṛchata “ask him!” that opens the verse and the two forms of √pṛch
opening vs. 2.
As recognized by all, sā́nv … is difficult. Since a feminine subject is pretty
much excluded, I interpr. sā́as sá ā́(already floated as a poss. by Old [Noten]). In
this clause, repeating immediately preceding īyate, ā́and nú add locational and
temporal specificity. (The publ. tr. might make this clearer with “he is here and now
implored.”)
Although I think the primary sense of iṣṭáyaḥ is ‘wishes’ (nicely contrasting
with praśíṣaḥ ‘commands’), the secondary sense ‘offerings’ (to √yaj) can also be
present. Although that sense is rare and usually associated with root-accented íṣṭi-,
puns often ignore accent, and moreover, since root-accent is secondary in this class
and spreading in Vedic (see Lundquist, -ti-stems), it is likely that there existed an old
(*)iṣṭí- ‘offering’ that underwent accent retraction in the course of time.</p>
<h3 id="i1452">I.145.2</h3>
<p>In b yád can be the neut. sg. acc. object of ágrabhīt (so most tr.), rather than
a subordinating ‘since’ as I take it. Either is possible, and there is little appreciable
difference between them. If it is an acc. obj., we must supply a dummy obj. to pṛchati
in the main clause: “he does not ask about (that) which he has grasped …” As in
English (“… ask about what he has grasped …”) this dummy obj. can be easily
gapped.
In d Ge, Re, WG take the subj. to be an unidentified other man (Re “(tout
homme)”), not Agni, as Old and I do. The question in part rides on asyá. Those
favoring a change of subject may have done so in part because they wished to avoid
having asyá be coreferential with the subject. However, this is a non-issue: there are
abundant exx. of such coreferential constructions; a reflexive pronominal/adjective
isn’t required. On the other hand, they may be correct in this passage, in that b opens
with an overt reflexive expression svéna … mánasā “with his own mind” marking
Agni as subj. of the verb in that clause, and so asyá might be used contrastively, to
mark the referent of the pronoun and the subject of sacate as different. On balance,
though, I consider Agni still to be the subject, in part because the focus is so
relentlessly on him otherwise.
I would, however, change the “resolve” of the publ. tr. to something more in
keeping with the rest of the verse, perhaps “intellect, mental force.”</p>
<h3 id="i1453">I.145.3</h3>
<p>The identity of the ‘mares’ (árvatīḥ) is unclear; it should simply be a ritually
related entity of fem. gender used in the plural, which leaves the field pretty wide
open (hymns, prayers, ghee streams, etc.). It is unlikely to be the ladles (juhvàḥ)
though they are feminine and plural, because the tám … tám construction invites two
different subjects, like the tásmin … tásmin constr. in 1c.
Apropos of -praiṣa in c, Ge (fld by WG) claims that this does not refer to the
technical ritual sense of praiṣa- found in the later ritual. I would disagree. The word
clearly is meant to mean something different from praśíṣ-, also ‘command’ (though
to a different root entirely), in 1c, and this verse (3) is quite ritual-centric. See further
at I.180.6</p>
<h3 id="i1454">I.145.4</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. seems meant to illustrate the secret
knowledge that we are begging Agni to impart. It clearly concerns (some of) Agni’s
actions at the ritual in conjunction with other being(s), but, in the usual fashion of
such RVic riddling descriptions, the identity of the referents is left blank and the
verbs are not sufficiently precise to define the actions. The publ. tr. gives some
tentative identifications, and others are suggested by other tr.; I will not go further
here.</p>
<h3 id="i1455">I.145.5</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro. this vs. forms a ring with vs. 1 (so already Ge n.
5cd). Note also that vy àbravīd vayúnā … “he has declared the (ritual) patterns …”
recalls vayúnā návādhita “he has established the new (ritual) patterns” in the
preceding hymn (I.144.5).
The īm of pāda has no function, that is, no possible accusative reading. See īm
in I.144.3 (though that had a possible explanation).
Because of the position of hí in d, contra the standard tr. I do not think that
agnír vidvā́n should be construed with this last part of the verse (ṛtacíd dhí satyáḥ),
despite the pāda break that seems to put them together. Rather the hí clause explains
why Agni is knowledgeable and can provide the answers requested so forcefully at
the beginning of the hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i146-1">I.146</h3>
<p>Agni</p>
<h3 id="i1461">I.146.1</h3>
<p>The “three” and “seven” have received various identifications; mostly likely
for the “three” in my opinion are the three sacrificial fires, for the “seven” perhaps
the priests or, as a generic number, his flames.
Most (explicitly Old [SBE], Re) take Agni’s two parents to be Heaven and
Earth, and certainly some cosmic resonance may be secondarily meant. But the
repeated focus on the fire-churning sticks in the birth of Agni in Dīrghatamas’s
oeuvre (see reff. in publ. intro.) and the fact that the expression pitrór upásthe is used
elsewhere of Agni’s birthplace in the kindling sticks (most clearly III.5.8, VI.7.5)
make it likely that they are meant here as well. If so, this provides a solution for the
two gen. sg. pres. participles in c, cárato dhruvásya. Instead of supplying yet more
cosmic entities here (e.g., Old “and of whatever moves or is firm”), I take the two
gen. singulars as specifying the two entities making up the pair in the dual gen. pitróḥ
“of the two parents [lit. fathers]” in b, with one kindling stick held firm and the other
moving across it to produce friction. I take the asya in c as referring to Agni; because
it is unaccented, it should be used pronominally not adjectivally (despite WG “…
dieses Gehenden”), and it should refer to something already in the discourse (as Agni
is).</p>
<h3 id="i1462">I.146.2</h3>
<p>This verse seems to transition from narrow reference to the growth of the
kindled fire at the kindling sticks to an enlarged frame involving Heaven and Earth. I
take the dual ene in pāda a as referring still to the kindling sticks of vs. 1, but as Agni
stands up in b, he reaches further &ndash; putting his feet down on the back “of the broad
one” (urvyā́ḥ), a clear reference to ‘earth’, and licking the udder, presumably of
heaven &ndash; thus filling the intermediate space between them.</p>
<h3 id="i1463">I.146.3</h3>
<p>This verse has another unidentified dual as subject, here almost surely Night
and Dawn (cf. also I.144.6), although a simultaneous reference to the kindling sticks
cannot (and should not) be excluded.
The contrastive saṃcárantī / ví carataḥ is hard to capture in tr.</p>
<h3 id="i1464">I.146.4</h3>
<p>Pāda c is universally taken as a reference to Agni’s flight, his hiding himself
in the waters, and the gods’ discovery and recovery of him there. I find this unlikely,
but I do not have a better idea.
nṛ́̄n at the end of d is problematic. Ge takes it as a truncated gen. pl., hence
“the sun of men,” but I would prefer to avoid such grammatical inventions. Sāy takes
it as a dat. (nṝn nṛbhyaḥ), and Old (SBE and ZDMG 55: 286–88 [=KlSch 745–47]),
with a delicate adjustment of that interpr., states that ṇṝ́n can “stand for” different
cases, in this instance the dative, though it is an acc. pl. in form. This interpr. makes
it functionally parallel to ebhyaḥ, hence Old’s (SBE) “He the Sun became visible to
them, to the men.” I would prefer to keep it functionally the acc. pl. it appears to be
formally, and I therefore construe it as a goal with sū́ryaḥ “the sun towards men.”
The syntax of this interpr. is pretty dubious, however.</p>
<h3 id="i147-1">I.147</h3>
<p>Agni</p>
<h3 id="i1471">I.147.1</h3>
<p>All other tr. take dadāsúḥ as preterital (e.g., Ge “&hellip; haben … aufgewartet”),
but Kü (243) interprets this pf. stem as having presential meaning with an
implication of past action (“präsentische Bedeutung mit Implikation einer vergangen
Handlung”), and I take both this verb and injunc. raṇáyanta in d as presential,
establishing the ritual situation as so often in Dīrghatamas’s hymns. The present
moment continues in vs. 2.</p>
<h3 id="i1472">I.147.2</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) and Re take tanvàm in d as a reflexive pronoun and tr. “I extol
myself” (e.g., Re “(étant) ton laudateur, (c’est en fait) moi-même (que) je loue.”)
Although I accept this as a secondary reading, I think the primary sense of tanvàm
must be ‘body’ here, namely the body of Agni. Such is Sāy’s interpr., followed by
Old (SBE). The expression seems just a variant of V.28.4 ágne vánde táva śríyam “O
Agni, I extol your glory”; moreover, tanvàm is found in a number of Agni passages
referring to ritual procedures done on/to the body of the fire (e.g., III.18.4, VI.11.2,
VII.8.5).</p>
<h3 id="i1473">I.147.3</h3>
<p>In this vs. (which is also repeated as IV.4.13, where it is transparently
secondary; see comm. there) the masc. pl. rel. yé seems to have a referent in the main
cl. expressed by a form of the sá/tám prn., as would be expected: acc. tā́n sukṛ́taḥ
“those of good (ritual) action.” The publ. tr. reflects this apparently transparent
relative / antecedent relationship: Agni’s protectors are themselves protected by Agni.
However, the problem is that the sukṛ̥́taḥ would normally be the sacrificers, not
Agni’s protectors (pāyávaḥ), who should be helping Agni to protect the sukṛ́taḥ.
Hence the move by Ge and Re to supply a parenthetical “with them” in the main cl.:
“your protectors who guarded …, (with them) he guarded those of good action.” The
instr. pl. pāyúbhiḥ is elsewhere used in constr. with an impv. ‘protect!’ addressed to
Agni (I.31.12, 95.9, 143.8). In contrast to Ge and Re, Old (Noten) argues for
interpreting the syntax as it stands, and the renderings of WG and Kü (412) also do
not supply an instr. in the main clause. I am of two minds; on the one hand, a
rendering with supplied instr. seems to reflect the usual RVic situation better, but, on
the other, syntactically the yé … tā́n construction is unimpeachable and the poet may
have been aiming to express something slightly out of the ordinary. In the end I’ll let
the publ. tr. stand, but with some question.
The juxtaposition of impf. arakṣan in the rel. cl. and rarákṣa in the main cl. is
striking and begs for some functional differentiation. Kü (412) tr. “schützten” and
“geschützt hat” respectively but doesn’t otherwise discuss. The action of the rel. cl.
took place in the (semi-)mythological past while the main cl. may refer to the ritual
near-past with present relevance.</p>

<p>As in I.141.3 the homonymous roots √math ‘steal’ and ‘churn’ probably
both contribute to this passage, with the former in mythological, the latter in ritual
context.
The identity of the second member of the hapax cmpd. viśvā́psu- here and in
the apparently related viśvápsu- (3x) is disputed. The explanation now current
(accepted by Mayrhofer, EWA s.v. psu- and reflected in WG’s tr.) is Thieme’s
derivation (Gram.Kat. 539) from √bhas ‘breathe’, hence ‘ganz aus Atemhauch
bestehend’. However, this sense does not fit the passages very well, and for these
compounds I therefore prefer Re’s derivation from vásu- (EVP 3.29, 12.107–8),
despite Thieme’s criticisms and the phonological difficulties. Dīrghatamas seems to
play with this word: note the scrambling in pāda d vápuṣe, and in his I.162.22
viśvápúṣam ‘all prospering’ seems another variant. Somewhat more tenuous, note
that the companion qualifier here, viśvádevyam twice elsewhere appears with pūṣán-,
once also in I.162., vs. 3 (also X..92.13).</p>
<h3 id="i1482">I.148.2</h3>
<p>Kü (239), WG take mánma as the subj. of dadabhanta (Kü: “Den Spender
werden wirklich nicht schädigen die Gedichte”). This avoids having to invent an
unidentified set of beings inimical to Agni, but raises the question of why anyone
would think that mánma, which are generally benign and positively related to the
ritual, would harm Agni. (See, e.g., the mánma in I.151.6–8, also a Dīrghatamas
hymn.) I don’t think it’s a question of “sticks and stones may break my bones, but
words will never hurt me” &ndash; a very non-Vedic sentiment.</p>
<h3 id="i1484">I.148.4</h3>
<p>The expression in pāda a, “dissolve with his fangs,” sounds odd, but since
Agni’s fangs are surely his flames, the image is less contorted than it first seems.</p>
<h3 id="i1485">I.148.5</h3>
<p>Contra the Pp., Gr, and all standard tr., I read reṣaṇā́and take it as a cognate
instr. with reṣáyanti, rather than reading reṣaṇā́ḥ and interpreting it as a nom. pl. The
instr. possibility was suggested by Re in a note, though he follows the standard
interpr. in his tr. There is no crucial difference between the two interpretations,
however.</p>
<h3 id="i149-1">I.149</h3>
<p>Agni</p>
<h3 id="i1492">I.149.2</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the name Agni does not appear in this hymn, and
in the earlier verses there is some ambiguity as to who the referent is. E.g, in 1c the
stones (ádrayaḥ) might suggest Soma. In this vs. also there seems to be dual
reference to Agni and Soma, esp. in the compound jīvápītasargaḥ (already unusual
for having three members, a rarity in the RV). The middle term -pīta- can belong
either to √pā ‘drink’ or √pyā ‘swell’. In the former case the cmpd means ‘whose
surge is drunk by living beings’ vel sim. and should refer to Soma (and most
emphatically not to Agni, if ‘drink’ means what it usually does &ndash; though “to ‘drink’
smoke” is an idiom in certain languages); in the latter ‘whose surge is swelled by
living beings’ and should refer to Agni, whose flames are fanned by the priests
(though Soma would also be possible). Most interpr. (Gr, Old [SBE], Ge, WG) opt
only for the ‘drunk’ interpr. without fully explaining how the word can qualify Agni.
Old (Noten) has second thoughts and suggests instead ‘swell’, which Re also goes for.
I think the poet intended the ambiguity.
Pāda c, however, might seem to tip the referential scales towards Agni: fire
can easily be envisioned as running forward (with its spreading flames) while not
moving from its original place of kindling. This is not an appropriate image for soma,
which is always on the run after its pressing &ndash; flowing towards the milk it will be
mixed with and towards the cups from which it will be drunk. But the “remain fixed”
interpr. depends on śiśrīta having a root affiliation with √śri ‘prop, fix’. So, inter alia,
Gr and Kü (528), who takes it as a pf. mid. opt. to √śri (as do I and WG). However,
other interpr. assign it to √śrī ‘mix, etc.’ (Old [SBE] ‘has ripened’, Ge ‘gemischt(?)
wird’) or an unprecedented verbal form beside root noun śrī, hence √śrī ‘être beau’
(Re ‘resplendit’). Narten (“Ved. śrīṇā́ti …,” 281 = KlSch 351) is uncertain which
root to assign it to, though her tentative tr. (“angelehnt bleiben dürfte”) reflects a √śri
affiliation. In any case, if śiśrīta could belong to śrī ‘mix, prepare’, it could easily
apply to Soma (“was mixed/prepared in his womb”), since Soma is regularly the
object of forms built to this root. The poet may well have meant this ambiguity,
which my publ. tr. does not reflect. I would therefore tentatively emend the tr. to
“would still remain fixed [/was prepared] in his womb.”
Note the phonetic figure sasrāṇáḥ śiśrīta, with redupl. + r-cluster involving
two different sibilants.</p>
<h3 id="i1493">I.149.3</h3>
<p>nā́rmiṇīm in pāda a is a hapax. Ge and Re take it as a place name qualifying
púram ‘stronghold’: Ge “die Burg Nārmiṇī.” This is of course a safe choice, but the
fact that the pāda lacks a syllable and that each of the other pādas contains a simile
marked by ná invite a reading ná ármiṇīm “the/an ármiṇī- like a stronghold.” This
possibility was already noted by Old (SBE). I suggested that it is derived from
arma(ká)- ‘flatland’ (see also Gr s.v. nā́rmin-); the same deriv. must underlie WG
“der wie auf eine verödete Palisade leuchtete,” with the meaning ‘ruined place’
attributed by some to arma(ká)-. If such a derivation is accepted, a few questions
arise. First, -in-stems are always accented on that suffix, as are the -ī-stems that
serve as their feminines (cf. garbhínī- ‘pregnant’). Hence we should expect ná
*armíṇīm. This might be easily solved by assuming the second accent was lost when
nā́rmíṇīm was re-interpreted as a single word. The second question is why we need a
feminine in the first place. There are several possibilities: 1) *armíṇī refers to
something inherently feminine; 2) it has been “attracted” into the fem. by fem. púrin the simile; 3) púraṃ ná *armíṇīm is to be interpr. as a single unit (with WG)
“illuminated as if (illuminating) an armín- stronghold.” If *armín- does mean ‘having
flatland, low-lying’ or the like, the third possibility is not likely, because of the
discrepancy in meanings (strongholds/fortresses presumably generally have
commanding sites) &ndash; though other proposed senses of the word might be more
compatible with ‘stronghold’.
Although problems remain with nā́rmiṇīm, like many hapaxes it participates
in phonetic play: note b nā́rvā, read ná árvā and 2a narā́m ná r-.</p>
<h3 id="i1495">I.149.5</h3>
<p>The annunciatory ayáṃ sá hótā “here he is, the Hotar …” opening the verse
is a typical final-verse signal of the epiphany of a god. Because Agni is on the ritual
ground already, he doesn’t usually have an epiphany, but this phrase may indicate
here the first sight of the kindled fire. The effect is particularly noticeable here
because vs. 5 repeats some of the key portions of vs. 4: (4 … dvijánmā …, víśvā … /
hótā …; 5 … hótā … dvijánmā, víśvā).</p>

<p>This vs. is constructed in opposition to vs. 1. In vs. 1 the poet declares
himself under the protection (śaraṇé) of Agni (gen.) as if under that of the sun (gen.);
vs. 2 contains a number of genitives qualifying a negatively perceived person, who is
therefore implicitly contrasted with the genitives of vs. 1. To support this balanced
structure I supply “from the protection” (*śaraṇā́t) for the genitives to depend on
(sim. WG) and a verb of motion with the preverb of separation ví that opens the verse
(hence “(I go) away (from &hellip;)”). There are, of course, other ways to supply the
supporting structure.

<p>As Ge (/WG) suggest, the exaggeratedly successful mortal in ab is probably
meant to be the speaker himself. I have therefore supplied voce from 1a. The lack of

have 1st ps. ref. (see Jamison “sa figé”).</p>

<p>Mitra and Varuṇa
The publ. intro. gives a conspectus of the hymn, esp. the difficult first 5 vss.</p>
<h3 id="i1511">I.151.1</h3>
<p>For the ritual application of the various portions of this vs. see publ. intro.
Most tr. take góṣu and also perhaps apsú as the desired objects of battle (e.g., Ge
“(im Kampf) um die Rinder”), but these seem to me to refer rather to the
accoutrements of the soma sacrifice. The cows and the waters reappear in ritual
context (at least in my view) in 4d and 5b respectively.
The standard tr. also supply a verb with pāda d, but this seems unnecessary.</p>
<h3 id="i1513">I.151.3</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., I consider the birth described here to be that of
Agni (as throughout the rest of Dīrghatamas’s corpus and esp. in vs. 1 of this hymn),
not of Mitra and Varuṇa (with the standard tr.). I construe the Wackernagelpositioned vām with dákṣase in b. This dákṣas- is then the referent of īm in c.
I also take c as subordinated to d (with Re), not ab (with the others). That both
c and d have 2nd du. pres. verbs (bhárathaḥ … vīthaḥ) is suggestive, and the present
in c does not work very well with the mythological past in ab.</p>
<h3 id="i1514">I.151.4</h3>
<p>The voc. asura with short final probably stands for the expected dual asurā
(so read in the Pp. and accepted by the standard tr. and AiG III.53), though it is
barely possible that only Varuṇa (or Mitra) is addressed. The numerous duals
(ṛ́tāvānau, ghoṣathaḥ, yuvám, yuñjāthe) make this unlikely.
I consider the dákṣam in c to be Mitra and Varuṇa’s (like the dákṣas- of vs. 3)
and take divó bṛhatáḥ as an abl. of source: √yuj + abl. ‘yoke from’ is a fairly
common idiom.
Re takes apáḥ in d as ‘labor’ (“l’oeuvre (sacrée)”), but the accent is of course
wrong. Moreover, as indicated in comm. to vs. 1, the waters here make a pair with
the cows of 5b, both as ritual substances.</p>
<h3 id="i1515">I.151.5</h3>
<p>The standard tr. take mahī́in pāda a as a loc sg. (Ge ‘auf Erden’). Since loc.
sg. -ī is extremely rare, I prefer to take it as the du. nom./acc. it appears to be,
referring to the two world halves (see ródasī in 1c) in an unmarked simile.
In b the root noun tújaḥ is grammaticaly ambiguous; with Gr, Ge, WG,
Schindler (RtNoun) I take it as nom. pl., against Re (gen. sg.). (Old considers both
nom. and acc. pl., without deciding.) The image, in my view, is of a herd of cows
milling around in confusion on the ritual ground, but not raising dust as a real herd
would do &ndash; because, after all, the “cows” are really milk.
In cd, following Re’s interpr., I see reference to the times of the three soma
pressings. With Re I tr. uparátāti as zenith, referring to the sun’s position at the
Midday Pressing; ā́nimrúcaḥ is an abl. with ā́“until its setting,” referring to the
Third (or evening) Pressing. Unlike Re I do not take uṣásaḥ as ‘à l’aurore’ (as if a loc.
sg.), but rather as an acc. of extent of time, “through the dawns,” though an abl. sg.
with the preceding ā́(Ge “(bis) zum Morgen”) might be possible &ndash; in any case, a ref.
to the Morning Pressing.
On takvavī́- see also I.134.5. The stem occurs also in X.91.2, which is perhaps
the passage in which the ‘bird’ sense is the clearest. Although ‘swoopingly/swiftly
pursuing’ need not have a bird as its referent, and in our passage here the standard tr.
take it as simply a pursuer (presumably human; e.g., Ge [/WG] Verfolger), I am
inclined to take it as a bird of prey rather than simply a hunter, because taktá (and
other √tak forms) seem to be used esp. of birds and beasts considered to be like
them; see comm. ad IX.32.4. In our passage the point of comparison between the
cows in the frame and the takvavī́- has to be the crying out (sváranti), which fits the
sharp squawking of birds of prey, but not the general behavior of human hunters.</p>
<h3 id="i1516">I.151.6</h3>
<p>Pāda-final gātúm árcathaḥ seems to echo likewise pāda-final gātúm árcata
in 2c, but in fact, at least according to me and the other standard tr., the similarity is
misleading. In our passage gātúm is surely the object of du. pres. árcathaḥ, but in 2c
gā́túm is better taken as the object of the preceding verb vidatam, and árcata in
sandhi before utá, which opens the next pāda, is better taken as having the underlying
form árcate (so Pp.), the dat. sg. act. participle, rather than du. injunc. árcataḥ, which
is technically possible. This teasing but false superimposibility seems the opposite of
“poetic repair” &ndash; “poetic breakage” perhaps?</p>
<h3 id="i1517">I.151.7</h3>
<p>vīthó adhvarám exactly matches vītho adhvarám in 3d (save for the accent).
Here, unlike the false identity in vs. 6 just discussed, the phrases have identical sense
and reference.
In b the nominatives kavíḥ and hótā seem each appropriate to one part of the
rest of the pāda: the poet to manmasā́dhanaḥ and the Hotar-priest to yájati. Re’s tr.,
with his trademark verbosity, makes this division of labor explicit.</p>
<h3 id="i1518">I.151.8</h3>
<p>I take b with c, rather than with a as do the standard tr., since “the yoking of
mind,” whatever it may precisely mean, harmonizes better with the thought, songs,
and mind of the rest of the verse than with the more physical manifestation of the
sacrifice in pāda a. As for the meaning of the phrase, I assume that it is part of the
larger conceptual complex likening the sacrifice and its various elements to a chariot
and its associated elements. The yoking or harnessing of mind refers to embarking on
concentrated and deliberate mental effort for the sake of the sacrifice. Cf. Mitra and
Varuṇa’s yoking of their skill in 4cd.
“Yoking of mind” actually contains the pl. práyuktiṣu, but the pl. form is
probably the result of a mechanical metrical adjustment: mánaso ná práyukti (shortvowel instr.) is found at pāda end in X.30.1 in a Triṣṭubh cadence, and this phrase
was converted into a Jagatī cadence here by the addition of -su. The other two
occurrences of the stem práyukti- are likewise pāda-final in Triṣṭubh and end in -ti(ḥ).
One of these, … ná práyuktiḥ, is found two hymns after this one, in I.153.2, where I
(so also Re) take the phrase as abbreviated from *mánaso ná práyukti-, as here.</p>
<h3 id="i1519">I.151.9</h3>
<p>The voc. nárā in b was carelessly omitted in the publ. tr. Insert “o superior
men.”3
In c the phrase dyā́vó ’habhiḥ is rendered “the days with their daytimes” by all
standard tr. However, although there are undeniable instances of pl. dyā́vaḥ meaning
‘days’ (e.g., VI.24.7, 38.4) and áhabhiḥ is suggestive, I prefer ‘heavens’, which is the
more common meaning of nom. dyā́vaḥ. I.130.10 áhobhir iva dyaúḥ, with the nom.
sg., where ‘heaven’ is the only possible interpr., supports ‘heavens’ here. The context
of our passage gives no help either way: dyā́vaḥ is conjoined with síndhavaḥ ‘rivers’,
which would not seem to form a natural class either with ‘heavens’ or with ‘days’
(though see Klein, DGRV 2.144 for other exx. of ‘heaven’ conjoined with waters of
some sort), and the statements “the heavens have not attained your divinity” and “the
days have not attained your divinity” are almost equally puzzling &ndash; though I’d give
the edge of sense of the former.</p>

<h3 id="i1521">I.152.1</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) take the “garments of fat” to be rain, though WG consider a
reference to a libation also possible. Given the ritual focus of the previous and
following hymns, and esp. I.151.8a yuvā́ṃ yajñaíḥ prathamā́góbhir añjate “They
anoint you first with sacrifices and with cows,” I take the garments of fat to be the
oblations offered to them.
Pāda b is likewise unclear, in part because the sense of mántu- is not entirely
understood: seen comm. ad IX.73.6. Assuming ‘counsels’ is a reasonable rendering, I
think the point is that M+V provide us with an unending stream of good advice.</p>
<h3 id="i1522">I.152.2</h3>
<p>On the basis of acíttam bráhma in 5c, I tentatively supply bráhma as the
referent of etád here, which is the object of ví ciketat, and of tȧd in 3b, the object of
ciketa. The web of neut. sg. + √cit is tight in these vss.; note also that our bráhma is
touted as the ultimate weapon in the last hemistich of the hymn (7c). Pādas a and b in
this verse are implicitly contrastive, so the referent of etád should be something that
harmonizes with mántra-, but it cannot be mántra- itself, because that word is masc.
Neut. bráhman- fills the bill.
The gen. pl. eṣām could be dependent on tváḥ ‘many a one’ (so Ge [/WG]),
rather than on etád (Old, Re, me). In either case the referent is not clear. If it limits
etád, as I think (based partly on tád vām 3b; so Old), then it may refer to the gods,
esp. Mitra and Varuṇa, or to mortal poets inspired by the gods, in contrast to the
hapless ‘scorners of the gods’ (devanídaḥ) in d. If it is dependent on tváḥ I assume it
refers to the general run of clueless mortals. As argued in the publ. intro., I take ab to
mean that, whether or not it is comprehensible to ordinary people, speech properly
pronounced by poets comes true.
Whether the four-edged and three-edged weapons have precise referents is
not clear. Old and Ge [/WG] state that cáturaśri- is used of the vájra- in IV.22.2; this
is actually conjecture and probably false. The bahuvrīhi cáturaśri- is used without a
head noun in IV.22.2a, as the object of the part. ásyan ‘hurling’ (or ‘shooting’). The
next verse contains a form of vájra- (3c), but the context is not a direct restatement
of 2a; in other words, the two words need not have anything to do with each other.
Closer to the occurrence of cáturaśri- in 2a is áśman- ‘stone’ in 1d (i.e., the pāda
immediately before). Since stones can be hurled (cf. I.172.2 āré áśmā yám ásyatha)
and I know of no passage where the vajra is, if cáturaśri- has any clear referent in
IV.22.2, it is probably the stone, not the mace. It is perhaps worth noting that
IV.22.1c contains a string of words referring to ritual speech: bráhma stómam …
ukthā́, which suggests at least an indirect connection between ritual speech and the
four-edged weapon, as here. This leaves the three-edged weapon. Does it have a
precise reference (say, a trident associated with non-divinities) or is the poet simply
expressing the truism that higher numbers beat lower ones and four edges is better
than three?</p>
<h3 id="i1523">I.152.3</h3>
<p>See the publ. intro. for my view of the structure of this verse. I do not
believe that the four pādas need to fit into a consistent cosmological scheme, as other
tr. seem to, and in particular I do not think that cd refers to the morning sun or the
like.
The accent on píparti in d probably results from its being in an antithetical
construction with ní tārīt, though antithetical accent generally arises when the verbs
are directly adjacent.</p>
<h3 id="i1524">I.152.4</h3>
<p>The description of the Sun’s garments in c uses two technical weaving terms,
one of very limited distribution. ví √tan describes the stretching out of a piece of
(unfinished) cloth on the loom for weaving; the very rare root √prajj refers to the
‘abbrechen’, ‘abschliessen’ of the finished garment (EWA s.v. PRAJJ, flg. Hoffmann,
Fs. Knobloch = Aufs. 813ff.; Rau, Weben, 18), that is, presumably, the removal from
the loom and tidying up of the completed fabric. The garments (or fabrics) that the
Sun is wearing here are therefore not completed. Ge renders ánavapṛgṇā very
loosely, as ‘endless’ (“ohne Ende”) and further interprets the garment without end as
time (die Zeit); WG’s tr. is scarcely more precise (“nicht abgeschlossen”) and in their
n. they follow Ge’s time interpretation. But it is hardly likely that such an outré form
to a root confined to technical usage (and found in the RV only here) would be used
for such a simple concept, which could easily have been expressed by anantá-. Re’s
“denués de franges” (without fringe) at least reflects the textile associations of the
word (which Ge’s and WG’s do not), but otherwise seems somewhat bizarre. The
poet must have something very particular in mind: the Sun’s garment is unfinished,
still stretched on the loom. But what visual image corresponds to this bit of weaving
lore? I am not certain but suggest that the sun is rising through mist (the garments, or
better fabric) stretched along the horizon, and the ragged edges of this mist look like
the unfinished edges of fabric still on a loom. For a similar image see I.115.4 and my
comm. thereon.
This interpretation helps explain the first half of the verse, in which we see
the Sun when he is going forth (pāda a: prayántam) but not when he is settling down
near (b: upanipádyamānam) &ndash; near to the maidens presumably (a: kanī́nām), who are,
also presumably, the Dawns. I think we need to read these participles in reverse
chronological order. The settling down near the maidens happens before the visible
rising of the sun, the going forth. The Sun is nestled cozily (and erotically) with the
maidens below or at the horizon, and the ragged fabric provides a welcome veil of
modesty over their activities.</p>
<h3 id="i1525">I.152.5</h3>
<p>The first hemistich is taken universally as a reference to the Sun, and my
publ. tr. follows this understanding. However, this identification may not be very
strong: although, as Ge says, the Sun is sometimes imagined as a horse, sometimes as
a chariot, it can scarcely be thought to whinny (kánikradat) &ndash; this detail must simply
be attached because of the horse image &ndash; and the ‘high’ or ‘arched’ back
(ūrdhvásānu-) may be appropriate to the path of the sun across the sky but does not
fit the round shape of the actual heavenly body. Nonetheless, I don’t have a better
idea.
In the publ. tr. the rendering of acíttam in c should be “(Though it) cannot be
comprehended …” not “(Though it cannot be) comprehended …,” since the negation
is plainly there. This should be corrected also in the first line of the intro. I do not
understand the unusual accent (rather than expected *ácitta-). AiG II.1.226 cites a
few other examples (e.g., amṛ́ta-) but gives no explanation.
In the publ. tr. “their ordinance” does not sufficiently make clear that it’s the
ordinance of Mitra and Varuṇa (as in 4d mitrásya váruṇasya dhā́ma), not that of the
youths.</p>
<h3 id="i1526">I.152.6</h3>
<p>The son of Mamatā is, of course, Dīrghatamas, our poet.
In my view, the verse is describing the feeding of the fire with streams of
ghee, the milk-cows (dhenávaḥ) of pāda a; the “same udder” (sásmin ū́dhan) is the
fire place. Ge (/WG) see the cows instead as the rains and give a more cosmic spin to
the whole verse. But pāda c esp. supports a ritual interpr., as does the instr. ‘by
mouth’ (āsā́) in d, so characteristic of the ritual Agni.
For my transitive interpr. of brahma-prī́- ‘pleasing x with the formulation’
(contra ‘loving the formulation’ or ‘friend of the formulation’ of all others, including
Scar [338]), see comm. on I.83.2. In that passage the transitive value is strongly
favored by context; here, given Agni’s usual middle-man role as both sacrificer and
sacrificed to, it is less clear. I could accept ‘loving the formulation, pleased by the
formulation’ here.
In d the literal sense of á-diti- ‘boundless(ness)’ works well with the main
verb uruṣyet ‘he should make broad space’. What, if anything, the goddess Aditi is
doing here is unclear to me. Ge suggests that the sense vacillates between the
goddess and the abstract noun, with the goddess the obj. of avívāsan ‘seeking to win’
and the abstraction of uruṣyet. This seems reasonable: because Agni’s mouth is the
conduit of the oblations to the gods, “seeking to win” the goddess “with his mouth”
would mean attracting her to the sacrifice to consume the oblation by means of his
mouth (/flames), while the abstract sense of the word expresses our own wish for
boundlessness or freedom. I would now emend the publ. tr. accordingly to “Seeking
to attract Aditi with his mouth, he should make broad space for boundlessness.”
Note that Aditi is identified with a milk-cow in I.153.3 below, a hymn with
many verbal and ritual ties to I.151–52. There Aditi the cow herself swells (pīpā́ya
dhenúr áditiḥ), while the cows in this passage cause Agni to swell (pīpayan).
For a quite different interpr. of the vs., see JPB’s Ṛgvedic Ādityas, pp. 200–1.</p>
<h3 id="i1527">I.152.7</h3>
<p>The first hemistich, inviting Mitra and Varuṇa to come here and partake of
our oblation, seems like a fuller and more straightforward version of 6d āsā́vívāsann
áditim just discussed, with the 1st ps. poet substituting for Agni as the enticer of the
gods.
In cd the two fronted asmā́kam have somewhat different uses, which are not
sufficiently reflected in the published tr. In c the formulation (bráhma) is one
produced by us &ndash; ‘ours’ in that sense. But in d we should be the recipients of the
heavenly rain; we do not produce it. Ge (/WG) and Re convey the difference more
clearly. I would slightly emend the publ. tr. of d to “for us should be …,” supplying a
copula with its optative value borrowed from precative sahyā́ḥ in c.</p>
<h3 id="i153-1">I.153</h3>
<p>Mitra and Varuṇa
This brief hymn reprises a number of the ritual tropes found in the preceding
two hymns, I.151–52.</p>
<h3 id="i1531">I.153.1</h3>
<p>In the second hemistich the clause beginning ádha yád raises some
syntactic/interpretational issues. The standard interpr. (also incl. Klein DGRV II.127)
assume that yád stands here for yébhiḥ, rendering the clause, in Klein’s tr., “and
(with) what(ever) they bear among us for you with their (poetic) thoughts, (just) as
the Adhvaryu&rsquo;s (do).” Besides arbitrarily modifying the relative marker, this interpr.
also requires supplying a 3rd pl. subj. for bháranti different from adhvaryávaḥ. I
prefer to keep yád as a subordinating conjunction and read ná as having domain over
the whole clause, not just adhvaryávaḥ. Although I am unhappy with this stretching
of the function of ná, the other alternations seem to me more radical. For a similar
use of ná (in my interpr.), see I.131.2fg and comment thereon. What Adhvaryus bear
to a god is soma (II.14.1 ádhvaryavo bháraténdrāya sómam; cf. I.135.3).
I do however now note that bháranti with unidentified subject is found in
I.151.7, where they bring songs (gíraḥ) along with thought (mánmanā) to the gods.
Given the verbal connections among these three hymns (I.151–53), I may need to
rethink the interpr. here along the lines of the standard tr: “They bring you (songs)
along with insights (dhītíbhiḥ), as Adhvaryus (do soma).”</p>
<h3 id="i1532">I.153.2</h3>
<p>As discussed ad I.151.8, I take ná práyuktiḥ (-ir in sandhi) as short for
mánaso ná práyukti-, as in that passage and X.30.1. I would in fact now go further
and suggest that the nom. sg. práyuktir here is a redactional change for práyukti, the
short-vowel instr. found at VI.11.1, X.30.1, and I would change the publ. tr. to “as if
*with the yoking up (of mind).” The form would have been changed to match the two
other nom. sg.s to -ti-stems in this hemistich, prástutir and suvṛktíḥ (both given in
their sandhi forms), and it would also avoid hiatus over the pāda boundary.
As for dhā́ma, I take it, as I do in I.152.4d, as an accusative of respect:
“following/with regard to the ordinance.”
This verse has another reminiscence of the preceding Mitra and Varuṇa
hymns in pāda c: the Hotar here anoints (anákti) Mitra and Varuṇa as an unidentified
plural set of ritual officiants do in I.151.8 (yuvā́m … añjate), the same verse
containing the yoking of mind.</p>
<h3 id="i1533">I.153.3</h3>
<p>As noted ad I.152.6, that verse contains both milk-cows (dhenávaḥ) and
Aditi, though not identified with each other as here. In that verse the cows cause
swelling, rather than swelling themselves. Nevertheless, I see thematic connections
between the passages. áditi- ‘boundlessness’ (with one reading of the word in
I.152.6d) perhaps qualifies the swelling milk-cow here: she swells without limit for
the good sacrificer. Again, an emended tr. might read *“The milk-cow swells as
boundlessness for …”
All the standard tr. take ṛtā́ya as an adj. qualifying the jána- (e.g., Ge “für die
rechtwandelnden Mann”), but adjectival uses of ṛtá- are rare to non-existent and the
conjunction of an abstraction and an animate being is not rare. Cf. in one of the
associated hymns, I.151.3 yád īm ṛtā́ya bháratho yád árvate, where the double yád
shows that two entities are in question (“for truth and for the steed”). Again, in
I.151.6a ā́vām ṛtā́ya keśínīr anūṣata, where the dat. ṛtā́ya is universally interpr. as
the abstract ṛtá-.
The standard tr. take d as a continuation of c, whose referent is still the man
who gives offerings first met in b. Since this man is clearly human, it seems awkward
to compare him to a human Hotar (mā́nuṣo ná hótā). I take d separately, with the
initial sá signaling here a new, nominal clause, whose referent is Agni. The simile
then makes sense, because Agni, though a god, regularly plays the role of Hotar at
the sacrifice (and could in fact be the Hotar in 2c). Agni is elsewhere qualified as
rātáhavya- (I.31.13, IV.7.7.), as are other gods (V.43.6, VII.35.1, VII.69.6), so this
epithet does not require a human referent.</p>
<h3 id="i1534">I.153.4</h3>
<p>The med. 3rd pl. pīpayanta here echoes act. 3rd pl. pīpayan in I.152.6b and
both are transitive: the form in our vs. is simply an -anta replacement/variant of the
usual type. Both have cows as (partial) subjects (dhenávaḥ and gā́vaḥ respectively),
but in I.152.6 the cows are, in my view, the streams of ghee swelling the fire, while
here the cows and waters are the usual additions to the soma drink. Agni is not absent,
however, at least in my view: the lord of the house in c is probably Agni, and his
position as ‘foremost’ (pūrvyáḥ) refers to his placement to the east as the Āhavanīya
fire.
In d the naked vītám can be fleshed out by comparison with I.151.3 vītho
adhvarám, despite Ge’s “Bekommet Lust” and Re’s “Goûtez”; WG’s “Verfolgt!” at
least reproduces the same verb they use for vīthaḥ in I.151.3.</p>
<h3 id="i154-1">I.154</h3>
<p>Viṣṇu</p>
<h3 id="i1541">I.154.1</h3>
<p>The hymn begins with an almost exact echo of the famous opening pāda of
the Indra hymn I.32 índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi prá vocam. In place of índrasya we have
víṣṇoḥ and the missing syllable is made up by inserting the fairly functionless
particle kam after nú.</p>
<h3 id="i1542">I.154.2</h3>
<p>The covert identification with Indra continues in pāda b, which is identical to
X.180.2a, where Indra is the referent.</p>
<h3 id="i1546">I.154.6</h3>
<p>bhū́riśṛṅga- is tr. by all as ‘many-horned’, but this doesn’t make a lot of
sense: each cow should have only two horns, unless Viṣṇu and Indra’s dwelling is a
place of fantasy creatures. I have therefore rendered it ‘ample-horned’, meaning that
the horns are quite sizeable. ‘Many-horned’ would be possible if the reference is to
the whole herd of cattle: each cow has two horns, but the collectivity has many. I still
prefer ‘ample’.</p>
<h3 id="i155">I.155</h3>
<p>Viṣṇu and Indra</p>
<h3 id="i1551">I.155.1</h3>
<p>2nd pl. vaḥ is one of those vague oblique references to the ritual personnel,
here something like “on your own behalf.” Because such a throw-away Sanskrit
word requires such a heavy English tr., I omitted it in the publ. tr.
pā́ntam here belongs to the nominal stem pā́nta- ‘drink’; see comm. ad
I.122.1.
As Ge points out, loc. sā́nuni and instr. árvatā show case disharmony between
frame and simile, in this case presumably because instr. árvatā is idiomatic. This is
one of the few instances in the RV referring to horseback riding.</p>
<h3 id="i1552">I.155.2</h3>
<p>The Pp. interprets sutapā́as sutapā́ḥ, hence a nom. sg., and this interpr. is
accepted by Re and WG. However, Ge argues persuasively for du. sutapā́, and I
follow him. The others must invent a mysterious soma-drinker who gives wide space
and freedom to Viṣṇu and Indra; as indicated in the publ. intro. I assume that the
clash (samáraṇam) in pāda a is what opens up the space.
The stem uruṣyá-, the verb ending both b and d, must be read in two different
senses (as recognized by all tr.); ‘go wide’ is a useful English idiom for an arrow or
other missile missing its target.</p>
<h3 id="i1553">I.155.3</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the sense of these enigmatic paradoxes is not
clear, as so often when family relationships and implied incest are in question. The
females who “strengthen his great masculine nature” are left unidentified, but in
some sense this scarcely matters: the point is that feminine beings strengthen his
masculine nature and shortly thereafter there’s semen in play. The dual mātárā can
(and probably does) stand for the two parents and is so tr. by all; however, it is more
piquant for the two mothers to enjoy the semen presumably of their son, and the
mother word contrasts with the father in c. For other contextually appropriate use of
the dual parental designations, see Dīrghatamas’s I.159.2–3.
In c it might be better if “names” were in parentheses: although nā́ma in d can
be either sg. or pl. (and is the former in conjunction with flg. tṛtī́yam), it can’t be dual,
as the pair of adj. ávaram páram “lower and higher” might require.</p>
<h3 id="i1554">I.155.4</h3>
<p>With Ge (/WG) I take the pronominal āmreḍita tád-tad as emphatic rather
than distributive, despite the identical pāda in X.23.5, where I opt for a distributive
sense because of context.</p>
<h3 id="i1556">I.155.6</h3>
<p>vyáti- from *vi-yati- (√yam), flg. Re.
Re takes vimímānaḥ in d as reflexive ‘se mesurant’, and Ge’s ‘sich richtend’
is close. Since med. forms of (ví) √mā are regularly transitive (cf. vimamé rájāṃsi in
the previous hymn, I.154.1b, sim. I.154.3cd), I would supply an object here. In the
publ. tr. I tentatively suggest “the realms,” as in 154.1, but given the contents of this
verse I would now supply “the year.”</p>
<h3 id="i156-1">I.156</h3>
<p>Viṣṇu</p>
<h3 id="i1563">I.156.3</h3>
<p>The Pp. reads vidá here, the 2nd pl. act. pf., though vidé or indeed vidáḥ
would be equally possible in this sandhi situation. Old says we’re not obliged to read
vidé, and the standard tr. follow the Pp. The cross-pāda sandhi -a ṛ- suggested by the
Pp is impeccable. As Dieter Gunkel points out to me (pc 11/5/15) “’underlying’ /-e ṛ-
/, /-a ṛ-/, and /-as ṛ-/ are all transmitted as &lt;-a ṛ-&gt; in the saṃhitā text. Where the
hemistich boundary intervenes, as here, they are also metrically identical, and
therefore identical in the restored text. I gathered examples of /-a ṛ-/ at hemistich
boundary from the first four books and found these: 1.15.12ab, 1.68.4ab, 1.116.23b,
1.152.3cd, 2.35.8ab, 3.14.” Nonetheless, against the Pp. I opt for the 3rd sg. mid. vidé,
which is common in this phrase (yáthā vidé).
The standard tr. interpr. pipartana in fairly generic ways: Ge “ihn heget,” Re
“comblez (le de louanges)” (taking it to √pṝ ‘fill’), WG “den … fördert.” In the
context of the birth motif found in pāda c as well as in 2c, I take the verb as more
precise and idiomatic: the usual ‘carry (to the far shore)’ narrowed to ‘carry to term’
of birth. The same sense is found in VI.48.5 (a passage adduced by Ge) gárbham
ṛtásya píprati of Agni’s birth.
nā́ma in c is ambiguous as to number (sg. or pl.), but is taken by all standard
tr., I think correctly, as plural. Given that Viṣṇu is being identified with a number of
gods in this hymn, he has multiple names, and this middle verse gives the clue to this
trick of the hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i1564">I.156.4</h3>
<p>The publ. tr. “does … follows” should be corrected to “follow.”
I don’t know why Varuṇa, the Aśvins, and the Maruts &ndash; gods that don’t
usually interact &ndash; appear together as followers of Viṣṇu’s krátu-. Syntactically it is
mildly interesting that a singular nom. (váruṇaḥ) and a dual nom. (aśvínā) together
form the subject of a plural verb (sacanta). By simple addition this is what we would
expect, but verb agreement often is governed by more local rules.
I do not understand the second hemistich either. Part of the problem is the
cmpd. ahar-víd- ‘knowing (or finding) the days’. I interpret it in light of the last
verse of the previous hymn, I.155.6, concerning Viṣṇu’s apparent control over the
days of the year. Since Viṣṇu is several times in this hymn (including in this vs.)
called védhas- ‘ritual expert’ (2a, 4b, 5c), the reference may be rather to knowing the
ritual day, as in I.2.2. But others see pāda d as depicting the Vala myth, and WG
interpr. aharvíd- in this Vala context: “das Tageslicht zu finden.”</p>
<h3 id="i1565">I.156.5</h3>
<p>The lexeme ā́√vī unusually takes a dat. inf. with dat. subj. as complement
(sacáthāya … índrāya), at least by my interpr. Despite the superficial similarity to
X.6.2 (ā́yó vivā́ya sakhyā́sakhibhyaḥ), the two passages have very different syntax.

<p>prá √bhūṣ is found only here (though cf. úpa-pra √bhūṣ in III.55.1 and ánu
prá √bhūṣ in IX.29.1) and the meaning of √bhūṣ in all its manifestations is
notoriously slippery. My tr. here is somewhat illegitimate: I generally tr. the lexemes
in III.55.1 as ‘tend to’, ‘attend upon’; my ‘tender’ here (a verb that has nothing to do
synchronically with ‘(at)tend’) is a pun on the English. Nonetheless, something like it
seems called for here: busy oneself with something to present and bring it forward.</p>
<h3 id="i1593">I.159.3</h3>
<p>The identity of these sons as the gods is clear from deváputre in 1c: ‘the two
[=Heaven and Earth] having the gods as sons’.
The referent of the son in d is disputed. Sāy (followed by WG) takes it as the
sun, on the basis of I.160.1; Ge as “jedes lebende Geschöpf”; Re as the human son. I
suggest rather that it is Agni. In 2 of the other 3 occurrences of ádvayāvin- it
modifies hótar- (III.2.15, VII.56.18), and in at least one (III.2.15) it&rsquo;s clearly Agni.
It&rsquo;s also the case that Agni is frequently associated with padá-. The hemistich may
convey that Heaven and Earth protect the general world of reality (c) and the specific
world of the ritual (d). I think it esp. unlikely that it is the Sun here, because of the
complementary relationship between I.159 and I.160, with the latter being the realm
of the Sun. See publ. intro. to I.160.</p>
<h3 id="i1595">I.159.5</h3>
<p>As Ge notes (n. 5ab), the first hemistich is reminscent of the Gāyatrī mantra
(III.62.10), with our pāda a tád (rā́dho adya) savitúr váreṇyam an expanded version
of III.62.10a tát savitúr váreṇyam and our b devásya … manāmahe perhaps meant as
a partial paraphrase of III.62.10b … devásya dhīmahi, with a misanalysis of dhīmahi
as belonging to √dhī ‘think’, rather than being the root aor. med. opt. of √dhā ‘place’
—hence the subj. manāmahe ‘we will think about’. This may provide significant
evidence of the status and interpr. of the Gāyatrī mantra at this early period.</p>

<p>Old suggests emending sudhṛ́ṣṭame ‘boldest’ to *sudŕṣṭame ‘loveliest to see’,
but this not only seems unnecessary but weakens the striking image. The girls,
dressed in their best by their father, presumably to attract potential husbands, seem to
be on public display &ndash; a very bold move for previously sheltered damsels.</p>
<h3 id="i1603">I.160.3</h3>
<p>Note the alliteration in ab … putráḥ pita
róḥ pavítravān, punā́ti …
The standard tr. take śukrám páyaḥ as two entities, “semen (and) milk,”
against my “blazing milk.” I do not know of any passages in the RV where śukrámust mean ‘semen’; it is overwhelmingly adjectival, and I prefer to render it so here.
The “blazing milk” that the Sun milks is presumbly sunlight. I take the asya here as
referring to the Sun and thus coreferential with the subject of the sentence. As
discussed ad I.145.2, overt reflexive forms are not required in this syntactic situation.
By contrast Ge thinks asya refers to Heaven and Earth (/the cow and the bull), but
conceived of as a single person and hence represented by a singular pronoun. Re
takes asya as referring only to the bull.</p>
<h3 id="i1604">I.160.4</h3>
<p>Ge and, apparently, Re (but not WG) take ānṛce not to √ṛc ‘chant, praise’,
but to a different root ‘hold’ (with sám ‘hold together’). (See also Old’s disc., though
he ultimately opts for ‘praise’.) But as Kü says (106), such recourse to “eine sonst
unbekannte Wurzel” is not helpful. Though Ge claims that in context ‘chant, praise’
is excluded, in the context of the whole verse it works fine, as Old points out. That
the first verbal form in the next verse is gṛṇāné ‘being sung’ (though modifying
Heaven and Earth, not the Sun) supports this interpr., esp. since ānṛce and gṛṇāne are
near anagrams.

<p>Praise of a horse (Aśvastuti)</p>
<h3 id="i1621">I.162.1</h3>
<p>Although the collection of gods serving as witnesses in ab seems somewhat
random, the same set recurs in V.41.2, as Ge points out. The reason for their
association there is no clearer than here.
Pāda d, pravakṣyā́maḥ (vidathé) vīryā̀ṇi, is a variant on the famous opening of
I.32, the great Indra hymn, índrasya nú vīryā̀ṇi právocam. The gen. índrasya of I.32.1
is matched by the long gen. phrase in our c: (yád) vājíno devájātasya sápteḥ “of the
prize-winning, god-born race-horse.” For another variant on this phrase in
Dīrghatamas’s oeuvre, see I.154.1. It is striking here that vīryā̀ṇi ‘heroic/manly’
deeds are attributed to a horse; the establishment of “personhood” for the horse,
discussed in the publ. intro., begins here in the very first verse.</p>
<h3 id="i1622">I.162.2</h3>
<p>It may not be clear in the publ. tr. that it is the horse that is bedecked
(prā́vṛtasya), not the goat.
viśvárūpa- modifying the goat in c is taken by most as a bland color term
(Ge/WG ‘allfarbig’, Doniger ‘dappled’), but, esp. because in the next vs. (3b) the
goat is called viśvádevya-, I think the qualifier is meant to convey more meaning:
perhaps to indicate that the goat stands for all the other animals (which, as disc. in
the publ. intro., are literally tied up for sacrifice in the later versions of the
Aśvamedha), hence my “representing all forms.”</p>
<h3 id="i1623">I.162.3</h3>
<p>It is appropriate that the goat, if it “represents all forms” (see disc. of the
previous vs.), should belong to all the gods. That it should also be “Pūṣan’s portion”
(pūṣṇó bhāgáḥ, 3b and 4c) probably follows from the fact that Pūṣan “has goats for
horses” (ajā́śva-: 5x, always of Pūṣan) and is generally associated with goats.
As for Tvaṣṭar’s involvement, Ge (sim. WG) simply says that Tvaṣṭar is the
creator esp. of animals, but I think there is a tighter connection. Tvaṣṭar is a required
presence in the Āprī hymns, the litanies that accompany the animal sacrifice. The
verse devoted to him in each hymn occurs immediately before the “Lord of the
Forest,” namely the stake to which the sacrificial animal is tied, releases the animal
for sacrifice. Just before that, Tvaṣṭar both produces life (e.g., II.3.9, III.4.9-VII.2.9)
and assists at the sacrifice (V.5.9), escorting the sacrificial animal to the gods
(X.70.9) or at least pointing the way (II.3.9). Most strikingly Tvaṣṭar is once called
viśvárūpa- (I.13.10) and several times enacts that epithet dramatically: I.188.9 tváṣṭā
rūpā́ṇi hí prabhúḥ paśū́n víśvān samānajé “Because preeminent Tvaṣṭar anointed all
the beasts (with) their forms”; X.110.9 rūpaír ápiṃśad bhúvanāni víśvā “he adorned
all the creatures with their forms.” In our verse Tvaṣṭar stimulates/quickens the goat
immediately before its sacrifice and indeed for its sacrifice, and that goat has just
been characterized as viśvárūpa-. Thus Tvaṣṭar’s constant appearance in the Āprī
hymns shows that this god has a defined role in the animal sacrifice, and that role,
somewhat paradoxically, involves both giving life and setting the stage for taking it
away by sacrifice. This is less of a paradox in the conceptual context of the animal
sacrifice: as noted in the publ. intro., a good deal of this hymn is devoted to
reconstituting the sacrificed horse and endowing it with life-breath. Tvaṣṭar thus has
a role in both, and we see it here first in connection with the goat that represents all
creatures. Tvaṣṭar recurs in vs. 19 below.</p>
<h3 id="i1625">I.162.5</h3>
<p>The list of priests contains the hapax ā́vayā(ḥ), whose derivation and
meaning are unclear. For suggestions and disc. see, e.g., Old, Ge, Re. I tentatively
favor a connection with áva √yā ‘propitiate, expiate’, but the form presents grave
difficulties for that analysis. For one thing, we should expect a root-noun cmpd.
(*)avayā́- with short initial vowel and accent on the root &ndash; and in fact we get just that
form in I.173.12. See detailed disc. by Scar (404–7, with our form treated in n. 565).
However, it can be pointed out that this lexeme is mutilated elsewhere &ndash; e.g., in
nearby I.165.15 (but Agastya, not Dīrghatamas), where vayā́m is better read ‘vayā́m
(i.e., avayā́m), which sandhi form its position after tanvè would allow. Thus, the
connection with áva √yā reflected in the publ. tr. is quite insecure, and it may be best
to follow Old in accepting the traditional analysis as ā́-vayas-, rendering it ‘whose
life force is (right) here’. This avoids the formal difficulties, but I don’t see what kind
of priest this would be.
There is a mild disconnect between the two hemistichs: the first half is a list
entirely in the nominative, but the second contains a 2nd pl. impv. ā́pṛṇadhvam,
whose 2nd ps. subjects should be the nominatives of ab.</p>
<h3 id="i1626">I.162.6</h3>
<p>The list of personnel involved in the sacrifice here includes some apparently
marginal and humble roles, perhaps to implicate the largest possible group in the
potential blood-guilt of the sacrifice.
I render the utó in d with ‘also’; this is also Klein’s tr., though his disc. of the
passage seems to seek a straight conjunctive role (DGRV I.448–49). See the same
expression in 12d.</p>
<h3 id="i1627">I.162.7</h3>
<p>I analyse prā́gāt as pra-ágāt, rather than Pp. prá agāt &ndash; in other words with
an accented verb, which is in a non overtly marked subordinate clause, with adhāyi
in the main clause. I then supply the same verb again in b. This may seem over-tricky,
but it avoids taking smát … mánma as a parenthesis and ties together the two ritual
actions, the procession of the horse and the production of the poem.</p>
<h3 id="i1628">I.162.8</h3>

<p>The placement of árvantam amid the pieces of tackle associated with him
seems strange at first, but in fact it can be seen as iconic: these various items hold
him, and so he’s surrounded by them. It’s also clever that the various things are in
the neuter, and so it is not till the verb appears (ā́yāmayanti at the very end of the
vs.) that it becomes clear that they are the subjects of the verb and therefore
nominative, while árvantam is clearly accusative.</p>
<h3 id="i16217">I.162.17</h3>
<p>The first hemistich is one of the few places in the RV that depicts horses
being ridden (see also I.155.1, 163.2 &ndash; though for an alternative for the latter see
comm. ad loc. &ndash; 163.9): both sādé lit. ‘in the seat’, here tr. ‘in riding’, and the
mention of goading with a heel require a rider physically on a horse.
I follow the general interpr. of śū́kṛta- as containing a syllable śū́used to urge
on horses, hence my “come on, come on.” Although Google tells me that “chirrup”
and “tchick” are so used (in English, or whatever we might call it), I judged that such
a tr. would simply sow confusion.
The three disfavored ways of goading a horse &ndash; heel, whip, and excessive śū́-
making &ndash; are not parallel, or rather heel and whip go together and śū́is something
else, and they are therefore summed up with useful vagueness by sárvā tā́“all these”
in d. The vagueness is also useful because none of the three is a particular suitable
object for sūdayāmi ‘I make sweet’, even in its most attenuated sense (Ge “… mache
ich … wieder gut”).
The neut. pl. tā́in the simile in c is more mysterious. hávis- ‘oblation’ is a
standard obj. of sūdáya-, but it is coopted here by the gen. háviṣaḥ. I have
nonetheless supplied ‘oblations’ as the referent of tā́. Ge supplies “die Fehler” on
grounds of contextual sense only. He also cites Mah. as explaining tā́as “nur
Füllwort” &ndash; an explanation I’d like to be able to use more often!</p>
<h3 id="i16218">I.162.18</h3>
<p>The preverb sám ‘together’ in sám eti may seem an odd choice in a verse
concerning cutting the horse apart. However, it sets up a contrastive pairing with ví
śasta ‘cut apart / carve up’ at the end of the 2nd hemistich, and it also anticipates (or
promises) the rejoining of the parts of the horse that ends the hymn.
As it turns out, horses have 36 ribs, not 34. Max Müller noted this in 1875 and
got a potential explanation from T. H. Huxley &ndash; that it may be that they’re cutting
the rib cartilage and they don’t cut the last two ribs in order to keep the carcass
together:

<p>In d I didn’t tr. píṇḍānām as a partitive gen. because the English got too
fussy. Ge thinks that the píṇḍa- are rice balls, but this seems anachronistically to
reflect later ritual use of the word.</p>
<h3 id="i16220">I.162.20</h3>
<p>The caus. redupl. aor. ā́tiṣṭhipat is tr. by most as ‘cause enduring pain’ vel
sim., which is far from the lit. meaning of the lexeme. The caus. to ā́√sthā
sometimes means ‘make stand still’, and I think that sense is in play here. The horse
is about to go on a journey (apiyántam ‘going along’ in pāda a; more fully described
in 21b), but various mishaps can keep that journey from happening and make the
horse stop.</p>
<h3 id="i163">I.163</h3>
<p>Praise of a horse (Aśvastuti)
Krick translates and comments extensively on this hymn (307–11), though
with a particular point of view.</p>
<h3 id="i1631">I.163.1</h3>
<p>The tr. of púrīṣa- as ‘fertile ground’ is an adaptation of Krick’s
(Feuergrundung, 101 n. 253). The basic meaning is ‘fullness, fulfillment’, but it can
indicate fruitful, loose rich earth, bottom land, as well as overflowing fullness.
‘Fertile ground’ provides a nice semantic bridge between the abstract sense and the
younger meaning ‘dung’.
I follow Re in taking pāda c as containing two de-composed bahuvrīhis at
least functionally. Though Re generally overuses this explanation, in this case we
have almost documentary proof, in that 9a contains both a real bahuvrīhi and a
decomposed expression like this one in parallel: híraṇyaśṛṅgó ‘yo asya pā́dā “having
golden horns, his feet copper.” In our pāda c the expressions are technically nominal
sentences with possessive value, with the possessive pronoun te to be supplied from
pāda d: “(your) wings (those) of a falcon, (your) forelegs (those) of an antelope.” But
these are tantamount to bahuvrīhis and go more smoothly into English that way.</p>
<h3 id="i1632">I.163.2</h3>
<p>I do not pretend to understand the myth or myths here; for an attempt see
Krick 307 and nn. 794–95. I would point out, however, that stylistically this vs. is
reminiscent of the famous vs. in the wedding hymn about the previous bridegrooms
of the bride in question. In both, four separate beings act, each segregated in a single
pāda, and it has some of the same vocabulary (note prathamáḥ, gandharváḥ, and
tritáḥ/tṛtī́yaḥ both ‘third’): X.85.40 sómaḥ prathamó vivide, gandharvó vivida úttaraḥ
/ tṛtī́yo agníṣ te pátis, turī́yas te manuṣyajā́ḥ “Soma acquired (you) first; the
Gandharva acquired (you) next. / Agni was your third husband. The fourth was
human-born.” I do not know what, if anything, to do with these similarities.
Krick supplies a chariot for the horse to be yoked to in pāda a and for Indra to
mount in b, but see 9d, where Indra clearly mounts the horse.</p>
<h3 id="i1633">I.163.3</h3>
<p>Again, I do not understand the mythology here. It is worth noting, though,
that in vs. 2 the various divinities acted on the horse (or such is the likely object,
though unexpressed), whereas here the horse (addressed in the voc.) is identified
with the (same) divinities. He is here identified with Yama (a) and Trita (b), while in
2a he was given by Yama and yoked by Trita. The third identification is with Āditya
(3a), most likely the sun. Of the three remaining characters in vs. 2 (Indra,
Gandharva, and the sun), the last is the most likely, and of course Āditya is a later
name for the sun.
On the meaning of samáyā see comm. ad I.113.10. The abrupt separation
from Soma is another puzzling feature, but I suggest that we have here the generally
later identification of Soma with the Moon, found already in the wedding hymn
already cited (X.85.1–5), which would make sense (well, some sense) if the horse is
being identified with the Sun. Krick (308 and n. 797) very different: “Du bist mit
Soma zur Hälfte durchgemischt,” which depends on her view concerning the
relationship between soma and the horse. But, inter alia, her tr. depends on what I
consider a wrong interpr. of samáyā.
From context alone the “three (kinship) bonds in heaven” could be identified
with the trio in ab: Yama, Āditya, and Trita. The Sun of course is associated with
heaven, and Yama’s realm of the dead is also placed in heaven (see the funeral hymn
X.14.8). What Trita’s connection with heaven might be I don’t know: Trita is a
shadowy figure in the RV.
I.163.5–7: Note the apaśyam ‘I saw’ in all three verses (5c, 6c, 7a): the poet bears
witness to his sight of various mystical visions of the horse.</p>
<h3 id="i1635">I.163.5</h3>
<p>As in I.162.14 I take the -ana-nominals here (avamā́rjana- and nidhā́na-) as
having trans./caus. value.</p>
<h3 id="i1636">I.163.6</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intro. to both I.162 and I.163, I take ā́tman- in these
hymns as referring to the lifebreath of the horse, as opposed to his sacrificed body;
see I.162.20-–21. Although ā́tman- can mean ‘self’ in the RV and sometimes perhaps
even ‘body’, the contrast between the horse’s ā́tman- and his tanū́- (see I.162.20ab)
seems to exclude those meanings here, pace Ge’s “dein eigenes Selbst” and WG’s
“Rumpf.”</p>
<h3 id="i1637">I.163.7</h3>
<p>There are multiple conflicting interpretations of the personnel and import of
this verse; I will not add another.
Pāda d raises several questions: 1) is óṣadhīḥ to be construed with grásiṣṭḥaḥ
(so, e.g., Ge, Doniger, and me) or with ajīgaḥ, 2) who is the referent of grásiṣṭhaḥ,
and 3) what person is ajīgaḥ. I take the plants with the splv. (For acc. rection with -
iṣṭha- forms, cf., e.g., VI.37.5 vṛtráṃ hániṣṭhaḥ.) Within the RVic domain of
discourse, the greatest devourer of plants is likely fire/Agni, the answer, therefore, to
2). With that identification in place, I take ajīgaḥ as 3rd sg. For an opposite interpr. on
all 3 counts, cf. Krick’s “… dann wahrlich hast du, der Gefrässigste, die Pflanzen
erweckt (verschlungen?).” The subject is the horse=sun, addressed in the 2nd ps. She
takes the verb as suggesting a 2ndary pun on √gṝ ‘swallow’, and considers the larger
sense to be that the rising sun (in spring) awakes the plant world to new life, and is at
the same time their “Fresser.” This builds a lot of superstructure into the vs. In my
opinion, the pāda simply expresses the conceit that the kindling of the ritual fire
causes the sun to rise; assuming, with Krick et al, that “you” is the horse=sun, it can
be the object of ajīgaḥ, with Agni as the subj.</p>
<h3 id="i1638">I.163.8</h3>
<p>The preverb ánu is insistently repeated in this verse: twice each in a and b,
once each in c and d. The first hemistich lacks a verb, but this can easily be supplied
from īyuḥ (√i ‘go’) in c; d then varies this pattern with a different verb mamire (√mā
‘measure’) to be supplied with ánu.</p>
<h3 id="i1639">I.163.9</h3>
<p>On the syntax of pāda a, see comm. on 1c.
Against the Pp (and all standard tr., as well as Krick) I take the sandhi form
ávara as standing for loc. sg. ávare, not nom. sg. ávaraḥ. Although ávara- is a
pronominal adjective, and several instances of ávare are nom. pl., there are also
several that are undeniably loc. sg. (II.9.3, 24.11). Taking it as a nom. sg. requires
attributing lesser powers to Indra, which strikes me as pragmatically unlikely (cf.,
e.g., Old “geringer (an Schnelle) war Indra”). My interpretation identifies the
horse/sun-bird with Indra and situates him in a lower realm (the midspace,
presumably).</p>
<h3 id="i16310">I.163.10</h3>
<p>This difficult vs. has been subject to numerous interpretations. Mine is
guided by Thieme’s (Gs Nyberg = Kl Schr (II) 829–30), who sees this as a
description of the V-shaped formation of geese in flight (of which Google Images
supplies many pictures, including bar-headed geese flying to/from their wintering
grounds in India). The “nose” is the lead goose and therefore a particularly crucial
figure, the śū́ra- ‘champion, hero’ of the cmpd. śū́ranas- ‘having a hero as a nose’
(an analysis that goes back to Bloomfield, RR 150; Bl’s other analyses there are less
compelling). sílika-madhayama- has a hapax as first member; if Th’s interpr.
(‘hollow space’) and etymological connection (with sirā́- ‘vein’) are accepted, the
cmpd. means ‘having a hollow space in the middle’, which accurately describes the
V-formation. The other problematic bahuvrīhi is īrmā́nta-. Th. takes īrmá- as
‘foreleg, thigh’, not īrmá- ‘quiet, at rest’. The ‘foreleg’ sense is found in the AV
(X.10.21), and Aves. ar(ə)ma- ‘arm’ appears to be cognate (so EWA s.v.). The sense
of the cmpd, ‘having (fore)legs as its edges’, must reflect the fact that, looked at
straight on, the V-formation (roughly an isoceles triangle) can look like a stick-figure
human from the waist down, with the legs being the two equal sides, meeting at the
tip, which is equivalent to the waist.
The verb in d, ā́kṣisuḥ, is generally taken as an isolated -siṣ-aor. to √naś
‘attain’ (so Gr, Narten 160; Wh Roots puts it under √akṣ as -iṣ-aor., but takes √akṣ
as a secondary root form from √aś). This is certainly possible, but I prefer to analyze
it as an isolated (and nonce) -siṣ-aor. to √aj ‘drive’, which would then take a cognate
acc. ájmam, hence ‘have driven their drive’.</p>
<h3 id="i16311">I.163.11</h3>
<p>I take caranti as aux. with járbhurāṇā(ḥ), but it could be an independent
verb: “they wander (while) flickering” (e.g., Ge “… bewegen sie sich auf und ab
hüpfend”).</p>
<h3 id="i16313">I.163.13</h3>
<p>I don’t understand the point and syntactic status of the (pseudo-)izafe
construction paramám yát sadhástham, and I therefore left out the yád in the publ. tr.
It may simply be a relative clause “what is his highest seat” with the main verb
fronted around it.
I take júṣṭatamo hí as a parenthetical explanatory clause, which would account
for the unusual position of the hí.
[I.164–65 JPB]
[I.165 Indra and Maruts (misc. comments by SJ to JPB tr.)
This hymn is full of somewhat “off” forms, some of them unique to the hymn
&ndash; yujmahe (5c), ūgrá- (6c, 10c), cyavam (10d) &ndash; a few confined to this hymn and
one or a few other passages &ndash; vadhīm (8a), kariṣyā́(9d). It is not clear to me whether
these are the result of faulty transmission or of the poet’s manipulation of form,
though I incline towards the latter explanation, given Agastya’s characteristic selfconscious artfulness. In either case the clustering of these anomalies in a single hymn
makes it unlikely in each individual case that they belong to the systematic grammar
of Vedic or reflect deep archaisms or old sound changes, as has been suggested for
several of them. For further remarks see the individual discussions below.
The trajectory of the hymn might be seen as the battle of the lexicon: words
pass back and forth between the two speaking parties, with twists in their usage and
with terms that seem to belong to one of the parties appropriated by, or devalued by,
the other. Among the most important words are éka- ‘alone, only’ and the multiple
forms of √kṛ ‘do’. Note esp. the extraordinary concentration of √kṛ in the middle of
the hymn: 7a cakartha, 7c kṛṇávāmā, 8d cakara, 9c kariṣyā́kṛṇuhí, 10b kṛṇávai, 11b
cakrá, including two of the rarest pf. forms, 1st sg. cakara and 2nd pl. cakrá.</p>
<h3 id="i1651">I.165.1</h3>
<p>I’d be inclined to take samānyā́not as an adv. (‘altogether’) as in the publ. tr.,
but as a fem. instr. sg. forming part of the phrase káyā śubhā́, hence “with what
joint/common beauty?” &ndash; with the sense “what’s their joint insignia? how shall I
recognize them?” Note that samāná- is differently formed from the two preceding
phonologically similar adjectives sávayasaḥ sánīḷāḥ, which do match each other.
Note also following sám m&hellip; The adj. samāná- returns in 7b in a charged context.
JPB’s tr. cleverly reads étāsaḥ twice, once as the nom. pl. ‘antelopes’, once as
the nom. pl. of the ppl. ā́-ita- ‘come here’.
In d śúṣṃam may be adverbial as JPB takes it (‘explosively’), but it may be a
real obj. of árcanti (“chant their explosive power”). I’m inclined to follow the latter
course, because śúṣma- must be a real noun in 4b. But in this case I interpr. it as an
Inhaltsakk., further specifying the chant (*“chant their chant” à “chant their
explosive force”) not the object of their praise as Ge, for example, does: “preisen den
Kampfmut” (sim. WG).</p>
<h3 id="i1652">I.165.2</h3>

<p>The act. forms iyarti, etc., are usually transitive, but Old cites a few passages
with the intrans. value that must also be present here.
Although various tr. (e.g., WG) take ukthā́as acc. pl. and supply subjects for
the pl. verbs ā́śāsate and práti haryanti (men and gods respectively, WG), taking it
as nom. pl. not only avoids the need to cast around for unexpressed subjects but also
captures Indra’s extreme egotism: even the hymns long for him, or so he thinks.</p>
<h3 id="i1655">I.165.5</h3>
<p>yujmahe is a famous crux: though it should belong to the well-attested root
aor. (seen presumably in part. yujānā́ḥ in pāda a), it has a primary ending and
therefore looks like a pres. formation. It has received a plethora of explanations. Ge
calls it a non-reduplicated perfect (“Perf. ohne Redupl.”); Whitney (Rts.) simply
allows for a root pres. for a few forms, incl. this one, in addition to the standard root
aor. Probably the currently prevailing interpr. is Hoffmann’s (MSS 2 [1952/1957]:
130–31 =Aufs. II: 366), that it shows dissimilatory loss of the first nasal from
*yuñjmahe belonging to the nasal-infix pres. Although this explanation has a
plausible foundation (as opposed to Ge’s motiveless non-redupl. pf.), the coexistence
of yujmahe with yujāná- in the same verse, and the general trickiness of Agastya’s
poetry, incline me to a nonce, contextual explanation. The oddly placed nú ‘now’
(though see 9a) immediately following the verb form and ending the pāda seems
Agastya’s signal that he’s twisted and tweaked the aorist to his own ends &ndash; a
temporary present. Thanks to JL for assembling the relevant lit. and for illuminating
disc.
I.165.5–6: Indra seizes the Maruts’ assertion of independent power (svadhā́- 5d) by
taxing them with the absence of (their exercise of) that power (6a) at a crucial
moment. Another skirmish in the battle of the lexicon.</p>
<h3 id="i1656">I.165.6</h3>
<p>I do not understand the length in ūgrá- here and 10c. Lubotsky (2000
[“Vedic root vṛ …,” Indoarisch, Iranisch und die Indogermanistik]: 320 n. 16)
attributes it to compensatory lengthening from *hí uHgrás, after laryngeal metathesis
from *hi Hugrás, but I find the proposed metathesis counterintuitive (despite the
other exx. he adduces); one would rather expect the laryngeal to remain where it is as
a hiatus-filler. Moreover, assuming that this remained as a synchronic rule in the RV
is quite hard to accept.
Indra adroitly manipulates the wording here to contrast his own solitary state
with the Maruts’ collectivity: … mā́m ékaṃ samádhatta “… me alone together
you…”</p>
<h3 id="i1657">I.165.7</h3>
<p>In vs. 5 the Maruts spoke literally of yoking their teams to bring them for the
journey, but in this vs. the same root √yuj is used metaphorically, in the gerundive
yújya-, to indicate the Maruts’ powers that were available to be yoked/deployed by
Indra, though he didn’t. Note also the adj. samāná- ‘common, joint’ (repeated from
1b) referring to the powers shared by the Maruts, in contrast to Indra’s constant lone
state.
The question in this vs. is whose krátu- do the Maruts plan to follow. Acdg. to
the JPB tr., it is Indra’s, but the tr. can’t stand exactly as given for syntactic reasons.
Because marutaḥ is unaccented, either krátvā has to belong to the yád clause or
marutaḥ has to belong to the main cl. But the publ. tr. assigns marutaḥ to the
dependent cl. and krátvā to the main cl: “we shall do many things in accordance with
your purpose, o most powerful Indra, when we, o fellow Maruts, shall wish it.”
Following the two syntactically licensed alternatives above, we must rather tr. either
“We shall do many things, o most powerful Indra, when, o Maruts, we shall wish it
in accordance with our/your will.” Or “We shall do many things, o most powerful
Indra, in accordance with your/our will, o Maruts, when we shall wish it.” krátvā is
perfectly placed for maximum ambiguity, between Indra and the Maruts. Taking it
with the main cl. (the 2nd alternative tr. just given) favors an interpr. of Indra’s will;
taking it with the subord. cl. (the 1st alternative) favors the Maruts’ will. That, I think,
is the correct interpr. The Maruts contrast Indra’s actions, which were performed
with the Maruts’ standing by on the scene, with their own prospective actions, which
will depend on their own intention, not Indra’s design or timetable.
The dueling vocatives in d, índra and marutaḥ, are notable, esp. because they
encase the word krátvā whose crucial ambiguity we have just discussed. Since we
must assume that the 1st
-ps. speaker is a Marut or Maruts, the pl. vocative to the
group is of course striking &ndash; though well within the limits of poetic self-address we
find elsewhere in the text (see disc. in my &ldquo;Poetic Self-Reference in the Rig Veda and
the Persona of Zarathustra,” Fs. Skjaervø, 2009). In this case I imagine a “spokesMarut” who takes the lead in addressing Indra but also turns to his own group for a
chorus of affirmation (of the type, “right, guys?!”).</p>
<h3 id="i1658">I.165.8</h3>
<p>Injunctive 1st sg. vádhīm belongs to the root aor. stem of this seṭ root, whose
well-attested 2nd and 3rd sg. are (á)vadhīs, (á)vadhīt. The 1st sg. should be *vadham,
which is nowhere attested. The -ī- has simply been imported from the 2nd/3rd sg.;
vádhīm is attested once elsewhere in the RV, in the late hymn X.28.7.
The juxtaposition of maruta indriyéṇa recalls the immediately preceding (7d)
índra … marutaḥ.
Pāda-final viśváścandrāḥ produces an irregular cadence of four heavy
syllables; three of the remaining four occurrences of the stem occur in the same
position (though once in dimeter vs.) and have the same effect. As is often remarked,
the cmpd. would be metrically regular if the 2nd member were the related -candra,
hence *viśvácandrāḥ with the light 2nd syllable appropriate to a Triṣṭubh cadence.
The same problem afflicts the other cmpds of -ścandra- (áśva-, svá-, hári- and puru-,
su-), which either show up in metrically indifferent positions or positions in which a
light 2nd syllable would be favored (besides Triṣṭubh cadence, also right after an
opening of 4, where a break ̆- - is distinctly bad). There are no forms where the
meter is improved by reading -ścandra-. Although the obvious solution is simply to
read *-candra-, I am puzzled as to how the -ścandra- forms won out. The duplicate
pair ścandrá- / candrá- are for the most part in complementary distribution, with
candrá- an independent adj. and 1st cmpd member and ścandrá- 2nd cmpd member
(after vowel); ścandrá- appears 3x uncompounded, but in these cases it is in a
sequence that functions like a quasi-cmpd (purú ścandrám III.31.15, pṛthú ścandrám
IV.2.13, and possibly ádhi ścandrám VIII.65.11). So viśvá-ścandra- has the expected
alternant, though in almost all cases a metrically unfavorable one. Must we reckon
with a replacement of the originally correct -ścandra- by *-candra-, yielding a
metrically usable form, and then redactional restoration of the -ścandra-? This
hypothesis seems over-complex, but I don’t have a better one. In any case the poet
seems to be toying with the form: the next pāda (8d) contains the offending sequence
śc, though split across a word boundary (apáś cakara), and in 12c a candrá- compd.,
candrá-varṇā(ḥ) occupies the same pāda-final slot. Its initial also participates in the
śc sequence: marutaś candrá-, so that the first member is effectively *ścandrá-.</p>
<h3 id="i1659">I.165.9</h3>
<p>The form kariṣyā́is problematic for several reasons. Despite its sandhi
position before k, it seems best to assume it represents 2nd sg. kariṣyā́s out of sandhi,
even though kariṣyā́ḥ would be the proper sandhi form in this context. (The Pp.
simply reads kariṣyā́like the Saṃhitā text, but the standard tr. and comm [e.g., Old,
going back to BR] take it as 2nd sg.) Moreover, this form must be a subjunctive to the
future stem, an unusual morphological combination at best (but see Whitney, Gr.
§938). Reading the transmitted kariṣyā́won’t help: that would simply be a 1st sg. subj.
to the future, or perhaps a 2nd sg. imperative to the future, neither of which is any
better morphologically. The other long-shot possibility is to assume it’s an unusual
gerundive formation in -iṣyá- in the neut. nom.-acc. pl., yielding “what things are to
be done …” (so Sāy.). AiG II.2.368 mentions this possibility but prefers the
subjunctive interpr.</p>
<h3 id="i16510">I.165.10</h3>
<p>In most tr. the rel. cl. of pāda b seems loosely construed with the main
clause of pāda a, with the yā́referring to an unexpressed acc. of respect in the main
cl.: “Let my force be far-reaching with regard to (those things), which I will do …”
However, the vertical parallelism of 9d, 10b, and 10d suggests a different syntactic
arrangement
9d yā́ni [kari]ṣyā́kṛṇuhí …
10b yā́nú [dadhṛ]ṣvā́n kṛṇávai …
10d yā́ni
Not only do these pādas match phonologically as in the display above, but 9d and
10d show the same syntactic structure: a preposed rel. cl. introduced by an acc. pl.
referring to deeds and a verb governing it referring to the doing of the deeds (yā́ni
*kariṣyāḥ; yā́ni cyavam), followed by a main clause where the doer of the rel. clause
is also subject: kṛṇuhí, īśē. I suggest 10b should be interpr. in the same general
pattern. Indra says “Which (deeds) (I am) bold (to do), I will do.” In other words,
pāda b contains two clauses, not one, and is independent of the preceding pāda.
The 1st sg. cyavam is the only non-causative active form to this root.
Hoffmann (Injunk. 247–48) takes it as a subjunctive, an ersatz for the unenlarged 1st
sg. subj. ending -ā. I agree that the form has been tampered with, but would suggest
that what really underlies the form may be medial subjunctive 1st sg. *cyavai, which
should have yielded *cyavā in this sandhi position. The -m serves as a pleonastic
hiatus filler (perhaps originally -m̐). An alternative that would work better
phonologically is to assume a 1st sg. indicative *cyave, not a subjunctive. This would
yield *cyava in sandhi, to which the -m could be added without adjusting the vowel
length. Since the verb in the main cl., īśe, is likewise present indicative (as opposed
to impv. kṛṇuhí in 9d and subjunctive kṛṇávai in 10b), an indicative in the subord. cl.
would match.</p>

<p>The final pāda of this vs. brings the vocabulary into reciprocal alignment
and thus signals that harmony has been restored: sákhye sákhāyas tanvè tanū́bhiḥ.</p>
<h3 id="i16512">I.165.12</h3>
<p>The med. part. dádhānāḥ is generally tr. ‘receiving’, as the middle voice of
√dhā often is, and interpr. to mean that the Maruts also get fame as part of Indra’s
reflected glory (see práti … rocamānā(ḥ) in a). But in this charged context of tributes
given and received, I think it likely that it is ambiguous. Indra is both graciously
yielding the Maruts some glory, but he is also reminding them that they have just
produced praise for him (vs. 11) and will presumably continue to do so. In this
second sense it could be tr. “setting out praise (for me)” with the middle voice
reflecting the mutually intertwined relationship between Indra and the Maruts.
With most interpr. I take ánedyaḥ as a nom. sg. m. implicitly modifying an
unexpressed gaṇáḥ ‘troop’, a construcio ad sensum with the pl. dádhānāḥ. I would
like to find some way to ally it with nédīyas- ‘nearer’, as a neut. sg. modifying
śrávaḥ, but this seems beyond the realm of possibility.
The saṃcákṣyā of the Saṃhitā text is read saṃcakṣya by the Pp. and taken as
a gerund, an interpr. followed by Old inter alia. The meaning would be “having
looked upon (me)” vel sim. Gr (fld. by Ge [WG], etc., incl. the publ. tr.) takes it as a
gerundive, whose pausal form would be saṃcákṣyāḥ. Both forms are possible. I do
not have a strong feeling either way.
On -ś candrá- see disc. ad 8c.
Note the pāda-final nūnám, reminiscent of nú in 5c and 9a.</p>
<h3 id="i16513">I.165.13</h3>
<p>The reciprocal lexical harmony of sákhīn … sakhāyaḥ recalls that found in
11d sákhye sákhāyaḥ, but there is a small mystery: the voc. pl. sakhāyaḥ surely refers
to the Maruts, but who are the plural expressed by sákhīn? We would expect a
singular referring to Indra. It seems unlikely to be the priests plus/minus Indra
because the speaker is a singular (note me in d, the sg. inter. prn. káḥ in the rhetorical
question in pāda a, and the sg. poet in vs. 14). I take that speaker to be Agastya
(contra the publ. tr., which identifies him as the narrator). Perhaps a pl. maiestatis for
Indra?
If návedā(ḥ) belongs to the s-stem návedas-, it should be nom. m. singular
here, in disagreement with the plural subj. of bhūta. Gr’s solution is to set up a them.
stem náveda- for just this passage, which would allow a plural interpr. To avoid this
ad hoc multiplication of stems, we can assume the same type of constructio ad
sensum invoked for ánedyaḥ in the immed. preceding vs. (12b)(so Old), with the sg.
referring collectively to the Marut troop. Cf. also the parallel passage IV.23.4 devó
bhuvan návedā ma ṛtā́nām, with a legitimate singular; the post-caesura portions of
the pādas are identical. On the origin of návedas- from a false segmentation of -tana
védas- see Schindler, Fs. Knobloch, 1985.</p>
<h3 id="i16514">I.165.14</h3>
<p>The first hemistich of this vs. is quite problematic; see Old’s long disc. The
problems lie in the verbs (or apparent verbs). The pf. cakré in b only makes sense in
this context if it is construed with the preverb ā́in pāda a: ā́√kṛ ‘make (to come)
here, bring here’. By contrast, the verbal stem duvasyá- is never otherwise construed
with ā́, even though it appears to be here. Moreover, the recipient of the friendship
offered by the verb duvasyá- is always in the accusative, not the apparent dat. duváse
here. (Note also that the suffix-accented duvás- appears only here and in nearby
I.168.3. It seems to show the regular possessive sense of s-stem adjectives built to sstem neuters by accent shift: hence dúvas- ‘friendship’ à duvás- ‘possessing
friendship, friend’.) The best solution seems to me Roth’s suggested emendation of
duvasyā́d to *duvasyā́, instr. of an abstract in -yā́, an emendation endorsed by Old.
Hence I would alter the publ. tr. to “When/Since the wisdom of the son of Māna has
brought us here with friendship, like a bard to a friend” vel sim. The emendation
only requires de-gemination of the -d d- and has no effect on the meter; the addition
of a -d might have been encouraged by the repetitive phonological pattern in a
(which I will represent with false word division): yádduvas yā́(d)duvás(e). Note also
the dental geminate in vartta in c, where the double -tt- may have been restored
etymologically (since Rtt and Rt generally fall together). Although there is no
nominal stem *duvasyā́-, there is the variant duvoyā́-, showing external sandhi (see
AiG I.343), also appearing as in instr. (V.36.6, perhaps not coincidentally in an Indra
hymn in a vs. addressed to the Maruts).</p>
<h3 id="i16515">I.165.15</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the tr. assumes underlying avayā́m (‘vayā́m in
sandhi) ‘propitiation’. This does not require emendation to the Saṃhitā text, since the
word appears after vowel-final tanvé.]</p>
<h3 id="i166">I.166</h3>
<p>Maruts</p>
<h3 id="i1661">I.166.1</h3>
<p>It may not be sufficiently clear in the publ. tr. that “the beacon of the bull”
refers to the Maruts themselves. They are presumably Indra’s “beacon” because they
are regularly his comrades and they are of glittering appearance &ndash; a little bit like
Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer.
The pair “kindling” and “battle” in cd may not seem to form a natural class,
but they probably represent two aspects of the Maruts’ naturalistic identity as the
thunderstorm: the lightning may be the kindling and the thunder the clash of battle.

<p>The simile hitā́iva is compared by Ge and Re with a similar expression in
IV.57.1, with the meaning “good (friends)” (Ge “wie gute (Freunde)”) or, more
technically, “like contracted (allies)” (see the bahuvrīhi hitá-mitra-). This doesn’t
mean much in the context here. WG are somewhat skeptical, but simply tr. literally
“wie die Hingesetzten” without explaining what that might mean here. Both the
Ge/Re and the WG tr. assume a ppl. to √dhā ‘set, establish’. I take it rather to √hi
‘impel’ (as does Gr) and assume that the underlying subject is horses and that the
image is of horses led out to piss before contests. See esp. I.64.6 (also a Marut hymn)
átyaṃ ná mihé ví nayanti vājínam “They lead (their horse) out to piss like a prizeseeking steed” (also cf. II.34.13, IX.74.4). This image fits well with the sprinkling
here.</p>

<p>áriṣṭagrāmāḥ is a bahuvrīhi, but the tr. ‘having an invulnerable band’
seemed too heavy.
On krívis- see comm. to I.30.1, where I suggest a relationship with kravís-
‘raw, bloody flesh’ as a re-formed -i-stem to the underlying root krū &lt; *kruH. A
number of other interpr. have been made.
I supply “(a path)” as obj. of rádati because words for ‘path, way’ are
frequently obj. of this verb (e.g., VII.87.1 rádat patháḥ; also II.30.2, V.10.1, V.80.3,
VI.30.3, VII.47.4, VII.60.4, X.75.2).
In my reading the structure of pāda d is quite complex and intricate and
differs from the standard. Both Ge and Re supply ‘waters’ as the obj. of riṇā́ti in the
frame (see also Old), since waters are several times elsewhere the obj. of √rī. (WG
take paśváḥ as obj. of both simile and frame.) I prefer to find the object nearer at
hand, namely trees, based on vánaspati(ḥ) in the previous vs. (5c). In another passage
trees liquefy at the Maruts’ assault: V.58.6 … riṇaté vánāni, and a transitive version
of this phrase is found with Agni as subj. at V.41.10 ní riṇāti vánā (cf. I.127.4).
As for the simile, Ge takes barháṇā as fem. nom. sg. with súdhitā (“wie der
beharrliche Eifer …”), but barháṇā, which is fairly well attested, is otherwise only
an instr. sg. used adverbially (so rendered by both Re and WG). Like Re and WG I
take didyút (fem.) of c as the referent of súdhitā ‘well-placed’, but didyút- in a
slightly different sense: not as a thrown missile but as a sharp-pointed thing used as a
goad. The verb riṇā́ti is held constant between simile and frame, but again it has
different senses in the two structures: in the simile it does not mean ‘liquefy, dissolve,
i.e., destroy’, but ‘make to flow, i.e., to cause to move’, a more appropriate meaning
with paśváḥ ‘livestock’ as object.</p>
<h3 id="i1667">I.166.7</h3>
<p>The rendering of alātṛṇá- as ‘restless’ follows the suggestion of Hoffmann’s
(‘unruhig’) registered in KEWA III.807 and EWA s.v., derived from √rā ‘be at rest’.
The word is found elsewhere only in III.30.10, of Vala. In neither passage does
‘unquiet, restless’ fit the context terribly well, but in neither is it excluded. Kuiper
(Aryans, 84–85, in part restating his 1955 Fs. Kirfel views) objects to Hoffmann’s
explanation and suggests instead the meaning ‘irresistible’ for our passage and ‘not
offering resistance’ for III.30.10. (On a side note, these two meanings, reflecting
passive ‘not (to be) resisted’ and active ‘not resisting’ senses respectively, do not
seem to me derivationally compatible and should not be found in a single word.) He
considers it to be a substrate borrowing and thinks it’s not realistic to expect it to
have an etymology. Kuiper has some good points: as was just noted, the meaning
produced by the Hoffmann etymology is not a perfect fit contextually and the
morphology is somewhat dubious. However, I do not see confidently proposing two
incompatible meanings for a single word (with the one suggested for this passage not
particularly compelling in context) while forswearing any attempt at etymology.
Better to leave it untranslated in that case.
Pādas c and d are in reverse logical order. The contents of the chant that the
Maruts chant (c) must be the deeds of Indra, which they are said to know (d); the
knowledge logically precedes the verbal expression of it.</p>
<h3 id="i1668">I.166.8</h3>
<p>As pointed out, e.g., by Ge, śáṃsāt in d must stand for *aghā́d śáṃsāt “from
evil utterance,” borrowing the aghā́t of pāda a (and cf. the bahuvrīhi agháśaṃsa- ‘of
evil speech’, referring to the utterer thereof). It may well be (with Ge, etc.) that
śáṃsāt should likewise be supplied in a, but “guard from evil,” without the addition
of “utterance,” is also perfectly acceptable.</p>
<h3 id="i1669">I.166.9</h3>
<p>Ge and Re make taviṣā́ṇi part of the frame, not the simile. This actually does
not alter the sense very much, since they still read mithaspṛ́dhyā with taviṣā́ṇi in an
“as if” construction. Given the structure of the hemistich and the need for something
for mithaspṛ́dhyā to modify, I prefer to take it with the simile. My only reservation
about putting taviṣā́ṇi in the simile is that the Maruts’ taviṣā́ṇi are mentioned in 1d.
More crucial is the grammatical identity and function of mithaspṛ́dhyā (so
Pp.). Old follows BR in taking this not as a gerundive but as a gerund, but, strikingly,
neither suggests a tr. for it. Since a simile consisting of a gerund would be highly
unusual (unprecedented, I think, though I haven’t checked the entire RV), a neut. pl.
gerundive agreeing with taviṣā́ṇi makes more grammatical sense. But what meaning
is being conveyed? I think the point is that there are so many good things on the
chariot that one can’t single out just one: like opposing forces (taviṣā́ṇi) they contend
with each other as rivals to be the best and most desirable. The sentiment is similar to
VII.26.4 mithastúra ūtáyo yásya pūrvī́ḥ “whose many forms of help compete for the
lead,” meaning that they are all eager to be the most helpful.
The loc. sg. prápatheṣu is taken by all standard tr. as “on (your) journeys”
(vel sim.), agreeing with the endpoint of Gr’s def. ‘in die Ferne führender Weg,
Reise in die Ferne, Reise’, which seems to me to follow a slippery path indeed. I
interpr. the stem prápatha- (4x) rather as lit. ‘the path forward’, but figuratively as
‘vanguard’. The -in-stem superlative prapathíntama-, found nearby at I.173.7, then
means ‘most in the vanguard’ (/’most forward on the path’), used of Indra there and
VI.31.5 (the 3rd occurrence, at VIII.1.30, is a PN). Although the difference between
‘journey’ and ‘vanguard’ is not crucial in our passage here, the two non-PN
occurrences of prapathíntama- both refer to Indra, with I.173.7 specifically to Indra
as warrior, and ‘most in the vanguard’ works much better than Re’s “toi qui (vas) les
grands chemins par excellence” or WG’s “der am meisten auf dem Weg bist.” Ge’s
“der am meisten auf der Kriegsfahrt” seems to recognize this. For prápatheṣu here
I’d be inclined to emend my publ. tr. to “on the paths forward,” because of the plural.
What is going on in d depends on the interpr. of samáyā, for which see comm.
ad I.113.10. Most take it to mean ‘in the middle’ vel sim.; this certainly produces an
acceptable image, since the axle is between the two wheels. But as discussed ad
I.113.10, the totality of passages containing samáyā suggest a meaning ‘altogether,
all at once, at the same time’, and in all these passages it contrasts with a form of ví
(as here). The image I see here is somewhat more complex than the standard one,
namely that through the action of the axle the wheels, though separate, turn at the
same time. This is close to the kind of paradox much loved by RVic poets. This
interpr. requires medial vāvṛte to be transitive (rather than intransitive-reflexive,
pace most tr. and also Kü 464), but the self-involved nature of the action (the axle is
turning its own wheels, as it were) makes this unproblematic. Potentially more
troubling is that by this interpr. cakrā́should be dual acc., and the stem cakrá- is
neuter, whose dual should be (and several times is) cakré. However, in at least one
passage, VIII.5.29, we have a clear masculine dual: ubhā́cakrā́hiraṇyáyā “both your
wheels are golden” (note the ‘both’ ubhā́), which would match the form here.
Alternatively, we could take cakrā́as neut. plural, assuming four wheels &ndash; and
though this would technically require two axles, “the axle” as a mechanical marvel
could stand for both. (Rather like saying “the internal-combustion engine powers
most of the cars on the highway,” even though every car has its own.)</p>
<h3 id="i16610">I.166.10</h3>
<p>The adj. rabhasá- ordinarily characterizes action (‘violent, frenzied’), but
here must have a visual aspect. So also III.31.12. Such synaesthesia is not uncommon
in the RV.
In d all standard tr. supply ‘they’ [=Maruts] as subject of (vy ánu) dhire, with
śríyaḥ as object (e.g., Ge “… haben sie ihre Herrlichkeiten entfaltet”). This amounts
to a change of person, for these same tr. identify the many good things of a-c as
‘yours’ [=Maruts], following similar statements in vs. 9 with vaḥ (a, cd). Though
there are no overt 2nd ps. pronouns in vs. 10, the voc. marutaḥ in pāda shows that 2nd
ps. reference continues in this verse. Rather than changing person in d, I see another
ex. of case disharmony between frame and simile, which is facilitated by the middle
voice of dhire. The simile váyo ná pakṣā́n “like birds their wings” uses the middle in
transitive but self-involved sense, but, in my reading, in the frame dhire is
intransitive, with śríyaḥ as subject. I must admit, however, that the person switches
to 3rd in vs. 11, so that a switch here in the last pāda of 10 is not impossible. I prefer
my interpr., with constant 2nd ps. in vs. 10, both because &ndash; all things being equal &ndash;
it’s best to keep verses self-contained and, more important, because Agastya likes
doing tricky things with similes.</p>
<h3 id="i16611">I.166.11</h3>
<p>I have not rendered the yé in b because in this verb-less string of nominal
qualifiers it is difficult to decide where the relative clause ends and the main clause
begins. (Both Re and WG take d as the main cl.; Ge seems to take it as cd, insofar as
I can interpret his punctuation.) Alternatively, the whole vs. could be a relative
clause hanging off vs. 10, or more specifically 10d. This structure would support the
change of person in 10d seen by most tr., as opposed to my interpr., for which see
immed. above.</p>
<h3 id="i16612">I.166.12</h3>
<p>This vs. has ties to earlier parts of the hymn. The opening tád vaḥ …
mahitvanám “this is your greatness” echoes 1ab tán nú vocāma … mahitvám. There it
was their previous (pū́rvam) greatness; this vs. presumably brings this greatness into
the present time.
Pāda b seems a paraphrase of 7a anavabhrárādhasaḥ ‘whose gifts are not
withdrawn’.
The connection between the main clause and the relative clause in cd is
somewhat loose: as a correlative to the rel. cl. jánāya yásmai “for whatever person”
we would expect tám, not tád, which must refer to the gift, not the recipient of it.</p>
<h3 id="i16613">I.166.13</h3>
<p>I take cd as a concrete example of the statement in ab, that the Maruts’
connection with the older generation arises from their favoring its “laud” (śáṃsam &ndash;
note that this positively viewed śáṃsa- contrasts with the evil śáṃsa- of 8d). Manu is
of course a member of the older generation, and because of his “insight” (ayā́dhiyā́)
the Maruts favor him and show themselves to him with all their wondrous qualities.</p>
<h3 id="i16614">I.166.14</h3>
<p>The relations among the clauses in this vs. might be problematic, primarily
because of an apparent gender mismatch: párīṇas- ‘abundance’, which in the instr.
párīṇasā goes with the rel. yéna in the rel. clause occupying ab, would be the most
likely referent of both yád in the parallel rel. clause of c and tád in the main clause of
d. And in fact that is how I (and the other standard tr.) take it. However, párīṇas- is
said to be masculine and yád/tád are of course neuter &ndash; an obstacle that Old for his
part considers too large to be overcome. However, the noun is most likely neuter.
This is what we’d expect of a stem built with suffix -nas-, and the only diagnostic
form for a masc. is acc. sg. párīṇasam in III.24.5. Otherwise the forms are singular
obliques, esp. in the collocation rāyā́párīṇasā “with wealth in profusion” (4x), and
hence ambiguous as to gender. The masc. acc. sg. is most probably a nonce form
created to match its usual formulaic partner, masc. rayí-, in the phrase rayíṃ
vīrávantam párīṇasam. See AiG II.2.738 and EWA s.v. Substantially the same
argument is made by Lubotsky (“Avestan xv
arǝnah-: The Etymology and Concept,
1998, 483).
abhī́ṣṭim in d is analyzed by the Pp. as abhí íṣṭim, as might be expected. Since
(vanishingly rare) root-accented íṣṭi- is derived from √yaj and means ‘sacrifice’, the
standard tr. exert a good deal of effort to introduce this sacrifice into their
interpretation, somewhat embarassingly in a pāda that already contains ebhír
yajñébhiḥ “with these sacrifices.” Cf. Re’s rather overblown “puissé-je l&rsquo;obtenir
grâce aux sacrifices que voici, pour (que vous soyez présents à mon) oblation” (the
“l’” in “l’obtenir” is the párīṇas-). I take it rather to iṣṭí- ‘desire’, in a phrase abhí
*iṣtím “to my desire, to my liking’. Either the annealed sandhi form *abhī́ṣtíṃ lost its
2nd accent redactionally, or the accent retraction that was ultimately to affect all -tistems (see Lundquist, -ti-stems) was already spreading to this stem, producing the
occasional íṣṭi- ‘desire’.</p>
<h3 id="i16615">I.166.15</h3>
<p>This signature verse of Agastya’s Indra/Marut hymns appears in I.165.15,
166.15, 167.11, and 168.10, but not in all of his Triṣṭubh hymns even to Indra. The tr.
of I.165.15 (JPB) differs somewhat from the others (SWJ). JPB interprets mānyá- as
a patronymic to a PN mā́na-, while I take it as an adj. ‘respectful’ derived from
mā́na- ‘respect’. It is possible that both are meant.
Both tr. follow Old in reading ‘vayā́m ‘propitiation’ (SWJ) / ‘reconciliation’
(JPB) for vayā́m. This requires no emendation to the Saṃhitā text, only to the Pp. My
tr. should, however, have an asterisk before ‘propitiation’ in all three cases.</p>
<h3 id="i167">I.167</h3>
<p>Maruts</p>
<h3 id="i1672">I.167.2</h3>
<p>What noun to supply with jyéṣṭhebhiḥ … bṛháddivaiḥ is an open question.
Ge confesses to uncertainty in his n. 2b, but implicitly supplies “help(s)” from pāda a
in his tr. However, the disjunctive vā ‘or’ would seem to exclude this solution, unless
it’s signaling a contrast between the Maruts’ “help(s)” and those stemming from
heaven, which seems unlikely. Klein (DGRV II.157) suggest “riches” (a suggestion
that goes back to Sāy), in part on the basis of rayím &hellip; jyéṣṭham in VIII.46.19; see
also IV.29.5 brhḁ́ ddivasya rā́yaḥ, adduced by Ge. The fact that “help(s)” and “riches”
both appear in vs. 1 (a and c) supports this view.
My tr. of cd differs from the standard ones and follows Jamison 1983: 84. I
take dhanáyanta as transitive, a straightforward ex. of -anta replacement (see
Jamison 1979). This involves taking niyútaḥ as accusative, not nominative, pl. and
paramā́ḥ as modifying the unexpressed Maruts, subjects of the verb. The standard tr.
“when their furthest/highest teams are running …” is certainly acceptable, however.
I.167.3–7: Hoffmann (Injunk., 194–97) translates and comments on these verses.</p>
<h3 id="i1673">I.167.3</h3>
<p>For the punning and diametrically opposed, negative and positive readings of
this vs. mediated by sabhā́vatī, see the publ. intro. Rodasī is depiced both as fit for
the sabhā (gaming hall) like a young woman who goes there in secret [=whore], but
also fit for the sabhā (assembly) like speech to be publicly uttered there (cf. the
sabhéyo vípraḥ “the inspired poet appropriate to the sabhā in II.24.13). For the
association between the sabhā and licentious sexual activity, see Falk (Bruderschaft,
90–92).
Ge (/Hoffmann, WG) take úparā … ṛṣṭíḥ as the lower part of the spear and
consider the shared characteristic between simile and frame to be híraṇyanirṇik
‘garbed in gold’, presumably referring to the decorated hilt or handle of the spear.
But I take úparā as meaning ‘nearer, very close’ (so approx. Re) and the point of
comparison is how close Rodasī is to the Maruts (“to whom she has been joined,
positioned well”: mimyákṣa yéṣu súdhitā) &ndash; as close as their spear, which is attached
to their shoulders: cf. I.64.4 áṃseṣv eṣāṃ ní mimṛkṣur ṛṣṭáyaḥ “On their shoulders
spears have rubbed.” (The verbs mimyákṣa and mimṛkṣuḥ belong to different roots,
but echo each other phonetically.)
The standard tr. take mánuṣaḥ as gen. sg., dependent on yóṣā, whereas I see it
as acc. pl. Either is of course grammatically possible.
Hoffmann (194–95, fld. by WG) sees sáṃ vā́k as a new, separate clause
(“Dabei ist die Vāc.”). Although I don’t entirely understand the position and function
of sám, I do not think making these last two words into an abrupt appendage works
well.</p>
<h3 id="i1674-1">I.167.4</h3>
<p>The polarized positive/negative treatment of Rodasī continues in the first
half of this vs., in my interpr. With Hoffmann (/WG) I take pāda a as separate from b
and supply a verb of motion with párā ‘away’. In b, in my interpr. only, the fem.
instr. sādhāraṇyā́‘common’ refers both to the fact that Rodasī is held by them in
common and that this type of relationship leaves her open to the charge that she is no
better than a whore. (As noted in the publ. intro., even Draupadī in the Mahābhārata
sometimes receives this insult because she is the common wife of all the Pāṇḍavas.)
The 2nd hemistich puns on the name Rodasī (once again, this is only my
interpr; others see it very differently), providing us with a grammatical problem. The
form found in the text, rodasī́, should by accent be the name of the Maruts’ consort,
but as a singular -ī-stem, it should be nominative, a grammatical identity that does
not fit the context well. Old takes it as an instr. Ge suggests that the word here is
flexionslos, which conveniently allows him to construe it as an acc. with ápa nudanta
(so also Re, without comment on the morphology). Hoffmann (fld. by WG) suggests
it’s an elliptical dual, standing for Rodasī and Vāc. I instead think it is a grammatical
compromise that enables a pun &ndash; a compromise between dual *ródasī, the standard
word for the two world halves (so accented) and sg. *rodasī́m, the acc. sg. of the
personal name. In other words, the rodasī́we have in the text is a formal
compromise: the right form for the dual worlds but the wrong accent; the right accent
for the singular woman but the wrong case form. This is where the pun comes in,
depending on a further implied pun on the ná that opens the line. On the one hand it
is the negative, to be read with the personal name: “did not push Rodasī away” (so
most tr.); on the other hand it is the simile marker, to be read with the two worlds:
“as they did push apart the two world halves.” This refers to the cosmogonic deed,
generally attributed to Indra, of separating the two world halves to create living space
between them. The ná is of course in the wrong position for the simile marker, but I
think Agastya relies on his audience to actualize his plays on words with hints like
this. The full version of this very condensed expression would be ná *rodasī́(m)
[/ródasī] ná “not Rodasī like the two world halves.
In the next pāda both Rodasī and the two world halves are then the objects of
a (quasi-)infinitival vṛ́dham (again, my interpr. differs from others’). Cf. the similar
expression in I.85.1c ródasī hí marútaś cakriré vr̥dhé “the Maruts made the two
world halves grow strong,” with a clear dative infinitive in periphrastic causative
usage. The only other ex. of acc. vṛ́dham in III.16.2 also has infinitival value and
even has the Maruts as subj.</p>
<h3 id="i1675">I.167.5</h3>
<p>This vs. depicts a svayaṃvara (self-choice) marriage likened to the
mythological prototype of the svayaṃvara, that of Sūryā. The identification of the
two female figures is underlined by the echo between asurí
yā ‘her ladyship’ (pāda,
referring to Rodasī) and ā́sūr
i
yā (opening pāda c, naming Sūryā).
jóṣat is an aor. subjunctive. As the first word of the verse, it introduces the
“choice” theme. I take jóṣad yád as a type of politeness formula “if X will be pleased
to …,” archaic English “an it please …” Note that dat. sacádhyai ‘to accompany’ is
complementary to dat. sakhyā́ya ‘for companionship’ in 4d and of course
etymologically related. The complementarity extends to the implied subjects: in 4d
the Maruts are taking steps to produce companionship; in 5a it is Rodasī who decides
to accompany them.
The bahuvrīhi nṛmáṇas- usually means ‘manly minded’ and so it is interpr.
here by most (Ge [/Hoffmann/WG] ‘mannhaftgesinnt’; Re ‘l’âme virile’). But though
she does display a fair amount of gumption, I find this an odd characterization of the
very feminine Rodasī. In this context I take it rather as ‘having her mind on (the)
men’ (that is, the Maruts, who are regularly called nṛ́-). See vṛ́ṣamaṇas- in 7c.
Pāda c presents the crucial moment in the RV svayaṃvara, the bride’s
mounting the chariot of the groom (see Jamison 2001, Fs. Parpola). On a possible
preterital tr. of ā́… gāt see comm. on the next vs.</p>
<h3 id="i1676">I.167.6</h3>
<p>The decisive moment of mounting is repeated immediately in this verse, in
the causative ā́sthāpayanta. The -anta form can be simply an -anta replacement of
act. -an of the usual type (Jamison 1979), but it might also be semantically justified:
“They cause(d) her to mount (their own chariot).”
As Hoffmann points out, ā́sthāpayanta need not be read as impf. ā́
asthāpayanta with the Pp., but can be an injunctive ā́sthāpayanta. The publ. tr. has
preterital “caused … to mount.,” and I still think that is correct, though a general
present could provide an easy transition to the here-and-now of the ritual found in cd.
My reason for preferring the preterital reading has to do with my view of the
structure of the middle section of the hymn: vss. 3-6ab treat the mythological
relationship between Rodasī and the Maruts, while 6cd–7 bring Rodasī and the
Maruts into the ritual present. I see vidátheṣu in 6b as the pivot: on the one hand it
echoes vidathyā̀in 3d and provides ring-compositional closure to the mythological
section of the hymn; on the other hand it looks forward to the ritual present 6cd.
Since the chariot mounting of 6a is part of the mythological past, a preterital (or
timeless) tr. fits it better. (It might also be better to tr. the injunc. ā́… gāt in 5c in the
same preterital fashion.)
In the publ. tr. I take śubhé with the preceding pāda: “mount for beauty,”
since śúbh- is very commonly used in Marut hymns to refer to their journey (cf., e.g.,</p>
<h3 id="i882">I.88.2</h3>
<p>śubhé kám yānti …). However, the juxtaposition of the first two words in
III.26.4 śubhé sámmiślāḥ pṛ́ṣatīr ayukṣata is suggestive of a connection here between
śubhé and nímiślām (though in the publ. tr. of III.26.4 śubhé is not construed with
sámmiślāḥ but with ayukṣata). Still I remain inclined towards my “mount for beauty,”
because I think nímiślām refers to Rodasī’s intimate connection with the Maruts,
which was emphasized at the very beginning of the mythological section, 3a
mimyákṣa yéṣu …, hence my “commingling (with them).”
As was just noted, I take 6ab as the end of the little Rodasī myth and 6cd as
the beginning of the section treating the current ritual. I therefore (contra the
standard tr.) take cd as dependent on 7, not on 6ab.</p>
<h3 id="i1677">I.167.7</h3>
<p>For my tr. of vṛ́ṣamaṇas- see disc. of nṛmáṇas- in 5b.
Ge suggests that the greatness of the Maruts (pāda b) is demonstrated by the
fact that Rodasī happily brings along their other lovers without jealousy. This seems
like an interpretational male fantasy to me (though I realize that our poet is also male
and therefore likely prone to the same fantasy). I have a much soberer and less
entertaining interpr. based in ritual. In the plural, jánī- is regularly used of the wives
of the gods, esp. in regard to their attendance at certain rituals. They are ordinarily
brought by Tvaṣṭar, but here Rodasī, one of their own, as it were, seems to stand in
as their chaperon and cicerone. In the Ṛtugraha offerings (the “sequential cups”), in
which a fixed order of gods receives oblations, the offering to the Maruts is followed
immediately by one to Tvaṣṭar along with the wives of the gods; see I.15.2–3,
II.36.2–3 (II.36.3d tváṣṭar devébhir jánibhiḥ sumádgaṇaḥ). Thus, given the temporal
proximity of the oblations made to them at this ritual, one might expect to find both
the Maruts and the wives of the gods together on the ritual ground.
I do not understand the force of cid in d, and in fact I think it’s been
automatically imported from the passages containing sthirā́cid where the adj. is a
neut. pl. and the point is that our hero (whoever it happens to be) has destroyed
various items “even though they are firm/hard” (I.127.4, IV.7.10, VIII.20.1). In other
words, I do not think it has a function here.</p>
<h3 id="i1678">I.167.8</h3>
<p>Because the verb in pāda a, pā́nti, is plural, not dual, at least one additional
subject is needed in addition to du. mitrā́váruṇā. The obvious one to supply is their
partner Aryaman, who appears in the next pāda.
In d Old, Ge, Re, and WG identify dā́tivāraḥ ‘wish-granting’ as the mortal
sacrificer, although, as they all acknowledge, the other two occurrences of this stem
modify the Maruts (III.51.9, V.58.2) and therefore the Maruts should be presumed to
be the default referent here as well. I see no reason to contravene this expectation. In
V.58.2 the adjective is singular, modifying gaṇá- ‘flock’, a regular cover term for the
Maruts, and I have supplied gaṇá- here as well. I also consider d to be an unsignaled
dependent clause “(when),” indicating the circumstances under which the unstirrable
things stir (c), viz. when the Maruts get strong. The verb would have accent in any
case because it is initial in its pāda. I do not, however, understand the īm in d, which
has no referent, since vāvṛdhé is intransitive (pace Gr). Taking the Maruts as the subj.
of vāvṛdhé also fits nicely with 9, which treats the “swelling strength” (śávas-) of the
Maruts.</p>
<h3 id="i16710">I.167.10</h3>
<p>ṛbhukṣā́in d may refer to the Maruts collectively, as I’ve taken it, or to
Indra, already mentioned in ab. Re suggests both possibilities, though he goes for
Indra in his tr. (as do Ge, WG). It is true that singular ṛbhukṣā́ḥ generally refers to
Indra, while it is plural ṛbhukṣánaḥ that qualifies the Maruts (VIII.7.9, 12, etc.). As in
8d I’m taking interpreting the singular as collective referring to the Marut flock. If
the referent is taken as Indra, the tr. should be altered to “the Ṛbhu-master of the
superior men,” which seems a bit awkward.</p>

<p>Ge takes b as parenthetical. Although I agree that the 1st sg. subject of cd is
also the subj. of pāda a, I think it less awkward to take pāda a as a nominal sentence,
given the sheer amount of material that intervenes between it and the verb in d,
vavṛtyām.
tuturváṇi- is a hapax, but it can hardly be anything but a pleonastically redupl.
form of turváṇi- (8x)(though it should be admitted that this latter stem is used only of
gods). The redupl. form is sometimes credited with a desiderative sense (‘zu erlangen
strebend’ versus turváṇi- ‘siegreich’, etc.: Gr; ‘zu gewinnen strebend’ versus turváṇi-
‘überwältigend’: AiG II.2.906, reproduced in EWA s.v. TŪRV; ‘cherche à
l’emporter’: Re), but I see no contextual or morphological justification for this.
WG’s iterative/repetitive “immer wieder überwältigend” is probably closer to the
mark, and it would fit with the repetitive ritual actions indicated by the āmreḍitas
yajñā́-yajñā and dhíyam-dhiyam. I would be inclined to emend the publ. tr. to “(am I)
ever victorious” or “continually victorious.” I do not understand Ge’s
‘zuvorkommend’.
The position of u in b is somewhat surprising. Klein (DGRV II.10 n. 16)
groups it with a set of passages in which u appears as the penultimate word (or
“word”) in its pāda after -ā and classifies it here as “expletive,” whatever that is
meant to convey. Closest in configuration is VII.68.4 … devayā́u ádriḥ#.
The standard (and I think correct) interpr. of devayā́(ḥ) here is that it is fem.
pl., agreeing with the implicit plurality of the (sg.) āmreḍita dhíyaṃ-dhiyam &ndash; an
interesting syntactic constructio ad sensum.</p>
<h3 id="i1682">I.168.2</h3>
<p>For the image in pāda a see the publ. intro.
The point of the simile in the final pāda is somewhat obscure. The frame &ndash;
“to be extolled by the mouth” (āsā́… vándyāsaḥ) &ndash; is unimpeachable, referring to
the poet’s oral praise, but why would gods be compared to cows and/or oxen for this
quality? Surely the Maruts are inherently more praiseworthy than cows! Ge suggests
that it’s like the praise of bovines at work (like the horses in I.27.1, though this
passage does not seem similar); WG tr. “(sie sind) die Kühe mit dem Mund, wie die
zu lobenden Jungstiere” and suggest that such cows are esp. sichtlich. This interpr.
loses the connection with the poet’s praise “by mouth” and, at least to me, doesn’t
make much sense as a way to refer to particularly visible cows. I suggest that there’s
an imperfect pun here on vándya-, which is phonologically close to bándhya- ‘to be
bound’ (not found in the RV or, acdg. to Wh Rts, till epic, but easy enough to
generate, and the stem occurs in the name of the anūbandhyā cow, a fixture in śrauta
ritual, already in the BYV Saṃhitās). The simile would then pivot on the verbal pun,
not on the visual image, with “by mouth” used in two different senses with vándyaand *bandhya-. In the latter case, it evokes a halter, the assemblage of straps that go
behind the animal’s ears, across the jaws, and around the muzzle, to enable it to be
led. The “bound” image adds another layer of meaning to the verse, suggesting under
the surface that we can exert control over the Maruts, bind them to us, by praising
them.
One small issue is whether gā́vaḥ … ukṣánaḥ is a single compound NP or two
different entities. Ge suggests the possibility of the former in his n. 2d, though his tr.
does not reflect it. The position of the simile particle would be slightly better if this
were the case, though my tr. doesn’t reflect it either, mostly because “bovine oxen”
doesn’t work well in English &ndash; or probably in Sanskrit.</p>
<h3 id="i1683">I.168.3</h3>
<p>The first hemistich has a nice chaining of similes, as Ge persuasively shows.
The Maruts are compared to soma drinks &ndash; not, probably, for any quality proper to
physical soma, but because, like friends, soma drinks are thought to “sit in the heart”
(cf., e.g., I.179.5 … sómam &hellip; hrts̥ ú pītám &hellip; and other passages adduced by Ge in n.
3ab). So the Maruts are “like soma drinks” only because soma drinks are themselves
“like friends”; the first simile is mediated by the second. Within the first simile is
embedded another metaphor describing the soma drinks “whose stalks are satiated”
(tṛptā́ṃśavaḥ), referring to the originally dry stalks which swell when soaked in
water (preparatory to pressing them). The result is a very dense set of nested imagery.
In c Kü (418) takes the rambhínī as a person with a crutch and WG as an old
man with a cane or staff. Although VIII.45.20 tvā rambháṃ ná jívrayo, rarabhmā́&hellip;
“Like elderly ones a staff, we have grasped onto you” shows that rambhám can have
such a meaning, the feminine rambhínī requires a feminine referent in the simile, and</p>
<h3 id="i1673-1">I.167.3</h3>
<p>in the preceding hymn, with Rodasī cozying up to the Maruts like their spear
(úparā ná ṛṣṭíḥ), supplies the thematic parallel. That the spear is found in the two
following vss. (4d, 5a) in this hymn also supports supplying it here.
kṛtí- is a hapax, but it is generally agreed that it means ‘dagger, knife’,
derived from √kṛt ‘cut’.</p>
<h3 id="i1684">I.168.4</h3>
<p>I supply ‘horses’ as subj. of a and obj. of b. Ge (/WG) take codata in b as
intransitive/absolute/reflexive [it is somewhat difficult to tell from the tr.] ‘treibt
selbst … an’, but this verb otherwise takes an obj., and if it were reflexive we would
expect middle voice. Re supplies the same obj. as I do.
I interpr. tmánā in its full lexical sense ‘with breath’, as sometimes elsewhere
(see also 5b). The “breath” of the Maruts would of course be the storm winds.
However, it is certainly possible that it simply means ‘by yourselves’, as in the
standard interpr. I then take káśayā as an implied simile matching tmánā, since the
whip is not usually associated with the Maruts, but with the Aśvins. However, in</p>
<h3 id="i373-1">I.37.3</h3>
<p>ihéva śrṇ̥ va eṣāṃ, káśā hásteṣu …, the Maruts do have a whip, so an
alternative tr. could be “spur them on with your own breath as whip” or “spur them
on by yourselves with a whip.” The use of tmánā with a clearly marked simile in 5b
may lend support to my interpr. of káśayā as an unmarked simile here.
The qualifier “dustless” (aréṇavaḥ), in combination with codata ‘spur on’ (b)
and acucyavuḥ ‘have made stir’ (c), evokes the common notion that dust gets stirred
up by violent activity (see, e.g., I.56.4=IV.17.13, IV.42.5). It is thus a paradox:
although the Maruts set many things in motion, they themselves remain unaffected
by this movement and therefore dustless.</p>
<h3 id="i1685">I.168.5</h3>
<p>Another vs. displaying Agastya’s tricky manipulation of double readings.
The standard tr. (but cf. Scar. 127) take vaḥ as the obj. of réjati (“who sets
you atremble?”), but this seems semantically unlikely to me. The Maruts are always
the initiators and causers of violent motion, as is esp. emphasized in these vss. (4–6);
no one external to them is likely to have the power to make them tremble. (This
seems to be implicitly recognized in Re’s supplied modal: “qui (donc pourrait) vous
faire trembler au dedans …?”) I instead construe vaḥ with antár (“among you”). The
question “who among you?” is a variant on the occasional rhetorical attempt to
differentiate among the Maruts. Ge (/WG) and Re take the antár as the locus of the
Maruts’ trembling (“within”; see Re’s tr. cited above). Rather than taking vaḥ as the
obj. of the verb, I supply dṛḷhā́ni ‘fixed places’ from 4d as obj. of réjati; dhánva,
extracted from the cmpd. dhanvacyútaḥ in c would be equally possible. Scar’s (127)
tr. is similar to mine, but he takes réjati as absolute (“Wer aus eurer Mitte … bewirkt
… das Beben …”). This is also possible. Scar also takes tmánā as “durch seinen
Hauch” as I do, contra the standard reflexive interpr.
The simile shows (or implies) a different syntactic configuration from the
frame, as Ge also points out (n. 5b), reflected also in Re’s tr. Although the frame has
a transitive verb réjati (possibly, with Scar, in absolute usage), the simile assumes an
intransitive form of the same verb stem; cf., e.g., III.31.3 agnír jajñe juhvā̀
réjamānaḥ “Agni was born quivering with his tongue,” with the tongue as here. I
read antár also with the simile (so also Ge), governing hánvā, interpreted as dual (du.
also Old, Ge, Re; WG take as instr. sg., which is morphologically more satisfying but
produces an image that makes no sense to me).
The third pāda continues Agastya’s crafty syntactic slippage between simile
and frame. I take the gen. pl. iṣā́m as parallel to the 1st cmpd member dhanva- in
dhanva-cyút- ‘stirring the wastelands, stirrer of the wastelands’. The simile would
then be an analytic (i.e., de-compounded) *iṣā́ṃ cyút- ‘stirrer of refreshments’
parallel to the synthetic rt. noun cmpd. dhanva-cyút-. ‘Refreshments’ here probably
refer to rain. For the root √cyu in this sense, see V.53.6 diváḥ kóśam ácucyavuḥ “The
[=Maruts] have stirred the bucket of heaven,” and for íṣ- as rain, e.g., V.68.5
vṛṣṭídyāvā rītyā̀pā, iṣás pátī … (of Mitra and Varuṇa as lords of rain). This analysis
allows the loc. yā́mani (like more common yā́man) to refer as usual to the Maruts’
journey. Ge (/WG) and Scar take yā́mani as part of the simile, resulting in a very
unlikely image: Ge “wie bei der Ankunft der Speisen,” with the shaking produced by
the Maruts compared to that produced by a herd of cattle or by the wagons bringing
in the harvest! (Re’s rendering is close to mine.)
The point of the last pāda is probably that the Maruts set many in motion, just
as the Sun (or in this case, his stand-in, the Sun’s horse) sends people to their tasks
on his daily appearance. The common property between simile and frame is
purupraíṣa-. Although in I.145.3 praíṣa- in this cmpd seems to have the technical
sense ‘ritual command’ common in later Vedic, I do not see that sense here, since
neither the Maruts nor Etaśa issues such commands. Re unaccountably takes the
second member as passive: “vous qui êtes multiplement incités.”</p>
<h3 id="i1686">I.168.6</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) take c with ab, with d independent, while Re configures the vs. as
I do. There are no implications either way.
The publ. tr. doesn’t render the ā́‘here’ with the verb in the rel. cl. āyayá. The
point is that they have arrived here despite the vastness of the space in which they
were driving, but “in which you have driven here” doesn’t work in English.
The frame and the simile in c do not agree in number: sg. sáṃhitam, pl.
vithurā́-iva. The number difference has a semantic function; the entity that the
Maruts are stirring is solid and a unity, hence hard to move, but they make it shake as
if it were comprised of a number of small unconnected pieces that are easily set in
motion. Although vithurá- is a deriv. of √vyath and does not contain the preverb ví,
its initial syllable plays off the sám in sáṃhitam, in the common contrastive pairing
sám ‘together’: ví ‘apart’. The real preverb ví opens the next pāda.
Ge (n. 6d) makes heavier weather of pāda d than seems necessary to me. I
think the “turbulent flood” (tveṣám arṇavám) is simply the dusky realm (rájas-) of
pāda a, i.e., the midspace in which the Maruts often find themselves. It is a turbulent
flood because of the storms the Maruts are producing. The stone (ádri-) need not be a
feature of the landscape (Fels, with Ge/WG), but a weapon of some kind, as often.</p>
<h3 id="i1687">I.168.7</h3>
<p>Ge’s n. 7 summarizes the gist of this verse, that what the Maruts bring is
both disruptive and welcome. Their gift is rain (vṛṣṭí-, which never surfaces but
accounts for the fem. adjectives throughout the verse), but it is accompanied by the
violence of the storm. The positive/negative pairings are found in the first hemistich;
the second one is only positive and ends by indirectly comparing the gift to the
Maruts’ own consort Rodasī.
The curiously formed hapax fem. pípiṣvatī is best explained, with Old, as
based on the perfect part. to √pi ‘swell’, pīpivā́ṃs-, fem. pipyúṣī, crossed with a -
vant-stem to match ámavatī svàrvatī in pāda a. Despite the tricky morphological
manipulation required, I prefer this to the easier derivation from √piṣ ‘crush’,
assumed by Ge’s ‘zerschmetternd’ (with ?), fld. by WG., and Re’s ‘pulvérisant’. Gr
(flg. BR) takes it as built to a desiderative to √pi, but there are no desiderative forms
to this root, whereas the pf. part. is quite well attested, esp. in the fem.
The last pāda has formulaic echoes that identify the female referent in the
simile as Rodasī. There are only two other occurrences of fem. asuryā̀-, one in
VII.96.1 referring to Sarasvatī (wrongly classified by Gr with the neut. noun), one in
the hymn immediately preceding this one, I.167.5, where it refers to Rodasī.
Similarly the bahuvrīhi pṛthujráyī ‘possessing broad expanse’ brings to mind another
passage adduced by Ge, I.101.7 rudrébhir yóṣā tanute prth̥ ú jráyaḥ “Along with the
Rudras [=Marut], the maiden [=Rodasī] stretches her broad expanse.” Although it
might seem somewhat unflattering to attribute “broad expanse” to a lovely young
maiden (esp. to us moderns; the ancients obviously had different canons of beauty), I
think this is a buried pun. The two world halves (ródasī) do have this quality, and it
has simply been transferred from that dual common noun to the fem. sg. rodasī.
jáñjatī has only one relative, jañjanābhávant- in VIII.43.8, where it modifies
Agni and must mean something like ‘flickering’. On its formation see Hoffmann (IF
60, 1952 = Aufs. p. 40). Here ‘scintillating’ captures the feminine quality better.</p>
<h3 id="i1688">I.168.8</h3>
<p>The identity of the subj. of udīráyanti in b is left undefined. Re takes it as the
rivers of pāda a, WG as the Maruts, and Ge leaves it undefined (“diese”). Although
my publ. tr. likewise uses a noncommittal pronoun, I am inclined to think it is the
rivers because of the úd ‘up’, contrasting with the áva ‘down’ qualifying the action of
the lightning in c. The noise the rivers make would be the roaring resulting from
streams swollen by rainfall, hence the qualifier abhíyam ‘coming from clouds” for
their speech.

<p>Indra</p>
<h3 id="i1691">I.169.1</h3>
<p>A difficult vs. to construe, esp. the first hemistich. In general I follow Old’s
somewhat bold interpr. He points out that pādas a and b are quite parallel, with pāda
a #maháś cid … yatáḥ matched by b #maháś cid … tyájasaḥ. He then suggests that
the parallelism would be furthered if pāda-final -tár-stem agent noun varūtā́(b) were
matched by a similar formation at the end of a, which is possible if we read *etā́
(agent noun to √i ‘go’) rather than etā́n. The final n of the transmitted form would
have been acquired from the pāda-initial nasal maháḥ that immediately follows.
Hence my “the one who goes,” which should properly be asterisked in the publ. tr. I
have supplied “(before),” to allow it to be construed with the abl. phrase beginning
maháḥ. Old sim.: “Selbst eines grossen Gehenden Gänger (d.h. Ueberholer oder dgl.)
bist du.” As for the abl. phrase, I assume the referent is the Marut gaṇá- (flock). I
also note the bad cadence and tentatively emend yatáḥ ‘going’ to *yātáḥ ‘driving’,
although keeping the transmitted form would not appreciably alter my interpr.
semantically. Although Old’s (and my) interpr. requires changing the text, the
standard interpr. need to supply extra material and/or juggle the supposed pronoun
etā́n, which lacks an obvious referent, and since Old’s way builds on the parallel
structures in the verse, I think the textual alteration is worth it.
What to do with marútām in c is the next question. Ge (see n. 1c) construes it
with both vedhaḥ and cikitā́n (“Du Meister der Marut, der (sie) kennt”), Re and WG
with the latter. However, neither vedhás- nor cikitvā́ṃs- ordinarily shows up with a
complement &ndash; though the passage adduced by Ge, I.156.4 mā́rutasya vedhásaḥ with
vṛddhi adj., gives me pause, and in the publ. intro. to I.156 I entertain the possibility
of a syntagm vedho marútām here. Since all three tr. then construe this gen. pl. also
with sumnā́, the only reason to attach it to either or both of the other two words
would be its position in the same pāda, which doesn’t seem to me sufficient.
None of the standard tr. renders naḥ in c (though see Tichy [-tar-, p. 192],
who does), but the sense of the first clause in cd must be “win the Maruts’ favors for
us.” This makes the second clause, “for they [=favors] are dearest to you,” a bit
puzzling. Why would Indra, who has been quite disdainful of the Maruts in this
hymn cycle, find their favors esp. dear? And if he does, why would he be willing to
win them for others? I do not know how to resolve these questions on the basis of the
transmitted text, which has verse-final préṣṭḥā, which must therefore be a neut. pl.
(or fem. nom. sg.). I would point out, however, that two hymns before (I.167.10a) we
find the phrase vayám adyéndrasya préṣṭḥā, with préṣṭḥā pāda-final, but standing for
masc. pl. préṣṭḥāḥ before a voiced sound. It is therefore possible that préṣṭḥā has
been adapted from there, without adjusting the sandhi and that it could therefore
mean “for they [=Maruts] are dearest to you.” Unfortunately, though this makes
better sense, it doesn’t make complete sense, since Indra and the Maruts are depicted
as still at loggerheads in this hymn. Perhaps préṣṭḥa- here reflects one of the senses
of priyá-, viz. ‘one’s own’. The Maruts would be “most your own” because they
have been, and will be again, Indra’s posse. If te in 2a should be rendered as I take it,
“your (Maruts),” this provides support for the “most your own” interpr. here.</p>
<h3 id="i1692">I.169.2</h3>
<p>Just as the standard tr. do not notice naḥ in 1c, they are also silent on te in 2a.
I tr. “your (Maruts)”; it could also be a dat. with áyujran “they have hitched
themselves up for you.” But the point is that Indra is a party to the action one way or
the other.
The simplest way to construe cd is to take hā́samānā as a predicated pres. part.
(so Ge), but it is possible with Re to supply a verb (“va,” in his case) or with WG to
take it as a nominal clause of possession (“Den Marut gehört Kampfaktion …”).</p>
<h3 id="i1693">I.169.3</h3>
<p>Both Ge and Re in different ways separate ṛṣṭí- from the well-attested ‘spear’
word and simply invent an otherwise non-existent stem (Ge ‘Hoheit’, Re ‘exploit’).
Ge justifies this by saying that ‘spear’ doesn’t make sense in context (never a strong
argument in RV interpretation, since so many contexts don’t) and that Indra never
otherwise has a spear. (Re’s EVP XVII, where the tr. is found, has no notes, so his
reasons are lost to us.) Ge then interprets ṛṣṭí- as a v-less form of vṛṣṭí- in I.52.5, 14
of the same meaning (in his opinion, though not others’). Even if Ge’s derivation
were more solidly grounded, the presence of ‘spear’ in the preceding two hymns
(I.167.3, I.168.4, 5), once with the same verb as here (I.167.3ab mimyákṣa … ṛṣṭíḥ;
169.3a ámyak … ṛṣṭíḥ), makes a separation from ‘spear’ extremely unlikely (as WG
recognize). As to what Indra’s spear might be here, I suggest that “fixing a spear” is
like planting a flag: it means staking a claim with a physical symbol of power or
authority, and Indra has in this way asserted his claim to the sacrifice, despite the
Maruts’ counter-claims, symbolized by the (cloud) mass they are sending this way.
Another possibility: although I sternly resist nature-mythology explanations in
general (and Indra’s “thunderbolt” in particular), in this context, with the stormproducing Maruts, it may be that a little conceptual flexibility is called for. In I.168.4
the Maruts are credited with lightning as their spears (ṛṣṭividyutaḥ), and in our vs. it
is possible that, while the Maruts speed the clouds in b, Indra wields a spear of
lightning.
The precise application of cd to ab is unclear. It seems to present two realworld analogues &ndash; one involving fire, the other (in a simile dependent on the first)
water &ndash; to the mythological situation in ab, but what do these analogues contribute to
interpreting what precedes? Before tackling that question, we must first decide what
cd actually means. Ge and Old both take dádhati as a 3rd pl. indic., which requires
finding a plural subj. Ge supplies priests and relegates the fire to a simile,
presumably marked by cid (which Ge takes a simile marker on a number of
occasions, though I do not think it can function that way). Old tries other strategies.
But taking dádhati as a short-vowel 3rd sg. subjunctive allows agníḥ to be subject
without problem (so also WG). The point of both the fire and the water examples
seems to be that these uncontrollable natural substances can produce unexpectedly
positive results and that, though both substances ordinarily destroy matter,
sometimes they create it. The “waters make an island” image is perhaps the easier
one: when waters wash away large amounts of soil and other material upstream, this
material often silts up downstream, forming islands in the river’s delta (as in the Bay
of Bengal &ndash; not that the RVic geographic horizon extends that far). It is almost a
magical process &ndash; dry land created from flowing liquid &ndash; and provides an
appealingly striking paradox. As for the fire image, fire burning in brushwood must
be implicitly contrasted here with the normal ritual fire, and the former is potentially
destructive. I’m not sure how it makes pleasurable offerings (usually associated with
the ritual), perhaps by roasting foodstuffs that happen to be in its path. It’s worth
noting that in II.4.7 fire “scorching the brushwood” also “sweetens the ground,”
another positive outcome: agníḥ śocíṣmām̐atasā́ni uṣṇán … asvadayan ná bhū́ma.
What does this have to do with Indra and the Maruts? Perhaps in this verse
addressed to Indra (note te in a), the poet is suggesting to him that despite their
unruly natures the Maruts might turn out to have something to contribute to Indra.</p>
<h3 id="i1694">I.169.4</h3>
<p>The instr. dákṣiṇayā seems to be what we might call an instr. of material or
specification; it expresses what the abstract ‘present’ (rātí-) consists of. Despite the
position of the simile marker iva, I (and all the standard tr.) take ójiṣṭhayā as
belonging in the simile. Such configurations are found elsewhere, in addition to the
far more common 2nd position of the simile marker.
As Ge also saw, the frame and the simile pivoting on pīpayanta have different
syntactic constructions. In the frame stútaḥ is the subj. of an intrans. (or possibly
reflexive) verb (“the praises swell / swell themselves”), whereas, since stánam is
masc., it must be the obj. of a trans. use of pīpayanta (“[they] make the breast swell”).
This clash is an example of the larger phenomenon of case disharmony in similes,
treated at length in Jamison 1982 (IIJ 24); this particular passage is discussed pp.
263–64, where the syntactic properties of the verbal stem pīpaya- are also noted. I
did not identify there the likely subj. of the transitive use in the frame, but flg. a
suggestion of Dieter Gunkel’s, in the publ. tr. I supply gift-cows, adapted from the sg.
dákṣiṇayā in b. There is another case disharmony in this same simile, with instr.
vā́jaiḥ corresponding roughly to gen. mádhvaḥ in the simile.</p>
<h3 id="i1695">I.169.5</h3>
<p>This vs. expresses the poet’s willingness to let Indra supersede the Maruts if
he provides sufficient wealth. The Maruts used to be the leaders, but now leadership
passes to Indra, by indirection: the poet ascribes the leadership to his riches. (The
cynical might think this ascription is not merely metaphorical.) As Ge points out, the
poet is essentially apologizing to the Maruts and hoping (pāda c) that they will
excuse his defection.
The iva in d is unusual in occurring after the verb gātuyánti. Ge tr. it more or
less as I do. Re seems to ignore it, as do WG (unless this is what their “just” in “die
… just den Weg wiesen,” though “just” [precisely] would seem to convey a sense
opposite to the approximative iva). It might be possible to consider iva displaced to
the left as sometimes, to be read with devā́ḥ (“like gods”), but this seems unlikely,
given that the Maruts are gods.</p>
<h3 id="i1696">I.169.6</h3>
<p>The question in the first hemistich is what to do with maháḥ. Ge must take it
as an acc. construed with yatasva: “vergleiche dich mit [come to terms with] den
Grossen &hellip;” But this pushes the sense and syntax of medial √yat, which generally
refers to physical placement (an interpr. encouraged by the seat [sádane] here) and
never otherwise takes an acc. Re takes it as adverbial, while WG maintain Ge’s acc.
pl. but read it with nṝ́n in the previous pāda (“den … grossen Männern”), starting a
new clause with pā́rthive. I take it as gen. sg., referring to the Marut flock, as in 1a.
Alternatively it could refer to Agni and the earthly seat could be the ritual ground.
On pṛthubudhná-, lit. ‘broad based’, see Thieme’s brief remarks (Fremdling,
p. 63 with n. 1). As he points out, it should not refer to the antelopes’ broad
Untergestell (with Ge), since antelopes are not particularly bulky, but rather to the
large amount of ground they cover. I take ‘base’ as equivalent to ‘stride’, somewhat
like English ‘wheelbase’.</p>
<h3 id="i1697">I.169.7</h3>
<p>The various gen. pl. adjectives in ab can modify either the antelopes or the
Maruts; with Ge I take them all with the Maruts. Despite the placement of ghorā́ṇām
and ayā́sām flanking étānām, both those adjectives are used of the Maruts in nearby</p>

<h3 id="i173-1">I.173</h3>
<p>Indra
The beginning of the hymn is characterized by pāda-initial injunctives in -at
(1a gā́yat, 2a árcat, 3a nákṣat, 3b bhárat, 3c krándat; note also non-initial ruvád 3c
and carat 3d). It is not surprising that this assemblage attracted the attention of
Hoffmann, who tr. the first three vss. (Injunc., 143–44). The function of these forms
is of course underdefined; I render them as simple general presents, more or less
with Hoffmann (“die generalle Beschreibung eines Opfers”), sim. Ge. By contrast,
Re takes them all as modal (“qu’il chante …,” etc.).
Another verbal pattern is the repetition of forms of the root √bhṛ: 2c bhárate,
3b bhárat, 4b bharante, 6d bhárti. In this case the poet seems to want to display how
many different idiomatic meanings he can find in this root.</p>
<h3 id="i1731">I.173.1</h3>
<p>IH suggests tr. gā́yat and árcāma as Engl. progressives: “he is singing .. we
are chanting.” He points out that the (implied) presential nature of the nominal cl. of
c and the future-referring final clause that depends on it in d support this interpr.
The standard tr. take véḥ as a nom. sg. In Ge’s tr., however, the bird seems to
be compared to the sāman, not the singer: “Er stimme den Gesang an, der
hervorschiesst wie ein Vogel.” So also Re, it seems. Hoffmann (/WG) make the more
natural (and grammatically correct) comparison with the singer. Although it requires
some extra machinery, I prefer to take véḥ as gen. sg. I think Ge is on the right track,
that the comparison is not the rather banal one between singer and bird, but the
quality of “bursting forth” (nabhanyàm) characteristic of bird song, a natural effusion.
If this is the comparison meant, then only a gen. will work, dependent either on sā́ma
read a second time or on a different word for (bird) song to be supplied.
The obj. of árcāma must be neut., which unfortunately excludes the cognate
arká- (m.). Any neut. word for verbal product will do (vácas-, bráhman-, etc.).
The pf. part. vāvṛdhānám would be better tr. “that has grown strong.” I would
thus now tr. ab as “He is singing the sāman that is bursting out like (the song of) a
bird; we are chant this (chant) that has grown strong …”
The syntax of cd is ambiguous; c can be an independent nominal cl., with d
dependent on it (so Ge, Re, and me) or the two can be read together as a single
subordinate cl. (so Hoffmann [/WG]), with the subordinating conjunction yád
postponed until pāda d. This is not impossible, since pāda c is a single NP, but it
seems a bit awkward. I prefer the two-clause solution.</p>
<h3 id="i1732">I.173.2</h3>
<p>An intricate verse, in which Indra both officiates as a singer at the sacrifice
and receives the sacrifice as his due. In pāda a Indra as bull is, by the standard
accounts, the subject, chanting along with the hard-laboring human priests (for
svédu-havya-, see Jamison 2015, BAI 25) and, in his fervor, eager to out-sing (áti …
juguryā́t) them. This is the only occurrence of áti with this root, but it can hardly
mean anything else.
The Hotar in pāda c is most likely not Indra, but Agni, as in the next verse.
This identification makes it easier to interpret the last pāda, where Indra, here called
a “young blood” (máryaḥ), supports “the pair,” who are likely (Ge’s parallels are
apposite here) the two priests Udgātar (the likely subj. of gā́yat in 1a) and Hotar (2c).
I.173.3–4: The -at injunctive pattern noted above comes to a climax in vs. 3, with 5
such verbs. The next -at form, jújoṣat, pāda-initial in 4c, is a subjunctive. The change
in mood, while keeping the formal expression -at the same, is surely deliberate.</p>
<h3 id="i1733">I.173.3</h3>
<p>As Ge hints (n. 3a), the first pāda depicts the paryagnikaraṇa, a ritual episode
that involves carrying a firebrand around various objects. In the animal sacrifice the
objects include the animals to be sacrificed. On the basis of passages like IX.97.1cd
(… páry eti …mitéva sádma paśumā́nti hótā “as the Hotar goes around the fixed
seats provided with [sacrificial] animals”), the fixed seats are the places where the
sacrificial animals are tied. The fixed seats here (sádma mitā́) must be the same
things, and the circling around is conveyed by pári … yán, which rather nicely
encircles the seats in the word order.
The problematic pāda is the second one. All the standard tr. take śarád- as a
gen. sg. in the sense of ‘autumn’, not ‘year’, with gárbha- metaphorical for ‘fruit,
product’; cf., e.g., Ge’s “die herbstliche Frucht der Erde” or Hoffmann’s
grammatically more punctilious “die Frucht des Herbstes der Erde.” This echo of a
harvest-home festival strikes me as extremely incongruous. Although śrauta ritual
does have a “first-fruits” ritual (Āgrayaṇa Iṣṭi, on which see, e.g., Keith, Relig. and
Philos., 323–24; Hillebrandt, Rituallit., 119–20), it is a minor, gṛhya-like rite and
quite marginal, and I am not aware of any mention of it in the RV, which tends to
confine itself to the far grander Soma sacrifice. I take śarádaḥ as an acc. pl. in the
‘year’ sense, expressing extent of time (“for years”), as it almost always does
elsewhere. What then does the pāda refer to? In ritual context gárbha- almost always
refers to Agni, either when just about to be kindled (and thus still in the womb of the
wood) or just kindled &ndash; though occasionally to Soma. The referent here is most
likely Agni. The phrase bhárad gárbham probably has two senses. On the one hand,
it is an idiom meaning ‘be pregnant’, and the acc. extent of time śarádaḥ is
appropriate to this sense: “(s/he) carried/carries the embryo for years.” Cf. V.2.2
pūrvī́r hí gárbhaḥ śarádo vavárdha “For the embryo grew for many years,” in a clear
pregnancy context. The question then is who is the subject; I suggest the Earth,
whose embryo it probably is (see below). On the other, this can refer to a particular
ritual moment, when the Āhavanīya fire is taken out of the Gārhapatya and carried to
the east to be set down (puróhita-) as the offering fire. In this reading the śarádaḥ
may refer to the regular repetition of the ritual year after year, and the subject would
be the priest, perhaps the human Hotar.
What I don’t understand in this pāda are the preverb/adposition/adverb ā́and
the relevance of the earth (gen./abl. pṛthivyā́ḥ). The most likely explanation of ā́is
that it is simply a preverb with bhárat, displaced to a position after the VP because
the pattern of -at injunctives in this hymn imposes pāda-initial position on bhárat. In
that case the publ. tr. should be slightly emended to “He bears the embryo … here …”
This seems to be the solution of Ge and Hoffmann [/WG], the latter two with clear
“herbei,” though no one comments on it. However it is possible that ā́should be
construed with śarádaḥ or even pṛthivyā́ḥ, though I do not see a way to make that
work. As for pṛthivyā́ḥ, I take it as a gen. with gárbham “embryo of the earth,”
though Agni is usually called the embryo of the plants or of the waters. Perhaps Agni
is the embryo of the earth because the plants in which he is immanent are themselves
products of the earth. As noted above, in the pregnancy reading of bhárad gárbham I
take the unexpressed subj. to be the Earth herself. In the ritual reading “embryo of
the earth” may signal the fact that the new Āhavanīya fire is being transported in a
clay pot.
In c Ge and Re identify the horse neighing while being led as Agni; this
would fit nicely with my hypothesis that b depicts the carrying of the Āhavanīya fire
to the east, though neither of them takes b that way. Ge also identifies the bellowing
cow of c as the Speech (vā́k) of d, which seems reasonable.</p>
<h3 id="i1734">I.173.4</h3>
<p>Old begins his n. on this verse with the cheerful comment “Wohl
hoffnungslos,” and it is well to bear this in mind. The difficulties are located in the
first pāda, which is seriously deficient in syllables (at best 9, probably 8), has a bad
cadence, and contains a hapax á/ā́ṣatarā at which all tr. and comm. throw up their
hands. The line is probably corrupt, and my attempts to fix it should be read with
skepticism. The meter can be ameliorated by assuming a haplology of acc. pl. kárma
adjacent to the identical verb, 1st pl. karma: tā́&lt;kárma&gt; karma (or tā́karma
&lt;kárma&gt;). [I now see that a similar haplology is proposed by WG in the n. to this
passage.] (For a less dramatic proposed haplology in Agastya’s oeuvre, see comm. ad
I.180.3.) If we detach á/ā́ṣatarā from sandhi with the preceding word (contra HvN’s
karmā́ṣatarā), the line would have eleven syllables, though it still would have an
irreparably bad cadence.
As for á/ā́ṣatarā, the only (more or less) clear thing about it is that it is a
comparative in -tara-, probably agreeing with tā́. Ge [/WG] refuses to tr. it &ndash; though
in their n. WG render the passage tentatively as “Diese (Opfer)werke haben wir für
ihn (gerade) zu den gesprenkelteren (bunter) gemacht.” I do not understand what
they are doing with áṣatarā, though the rest of the tr. reflects the haplology proposal
above. Re tr. “plus forts,” but without a note his reasons for this are lost; in his
introduction to AiG I (p. 59) he comments that the word is “sans doute corrompu.”
AiG I.239 tr. ‘annehmbarer’ without further explanation and floats the possibility of
“nicht rein ai. Ursprungs,” a suggestion that Kuiper takes as fact (Aryans, 25).
Mayrhofer refuses to speculate. I suggest, very tentatively, that it may be a
dissimilated form of *ā́ṣṭa-tara- ‘more obtainable’, built to the ppl. aṣṭa- to √(n)aś +
ā́. The initial long vowel in my reconstruction is contra the Pp., but the preverb ā́is
necessary to account for the initial accent and it is also the case that the ppl. to √(n)aś
does not seem to appear uncompounded in Vedic.
If this gossamer suggestion is correct, then the first two pādas outline a twostep strategy: we have first perfomed the easier ritual requirements in a, but more
concentrated attention is needed, and in b those fixated on the gods advance the ritual
activities. The second half-verse predicts that Indra will look favorably on these
efforts and will come to our ritual.</p>
<h3 id="i1735">I.173.5</h3>
<p>In its contexts sátvan- clearly refers to a successful warrior, but it is of
course a possessive -van-stem to the neut. pres. part. to √as ‘be’, whose participle, lit.
‘being’, often has the extended sense ‘actually being’ à ‘real’. I take the semantic
dev. of sátvan- to be a slangy ‘having the real stuff’, ‘the real thing’. Cf. the similar
Engl. expression “the right stuff,” the title of a novel by Tom Wolfe (and the movie
based on it) about the astronauts in the space program. For another conjunction of
śū́ra- and sánt- see 7a below.
Where to put maghávā is a minor question, since word order could support
grouping it with śū́raḥ (Ge, WG), separating it from both śū́raḥ and ratheṣṭḥā́ḥ (Re),
or grouping it with ratheṣṭhā́ḥ (me). What I am now certain of is that making
maghávā the primary focus of the rel. cl., with ratheṣṭhā́ḥ an adjunct, as I do in the
publ. tr. (“who is a benefactor, standing upon his chariot”), is wrong, since the
parallel relative clauses name Indra in various combat roles. I would now change my
tr. to “who is a bounteous chariot-fighter” or “who is a chariot-fighter, a benefactor.”
The acc. pl. pf. part. vavavrúṣaḥ simply shows perseveration of the redupl.
syllable (so also Kü p. 456) for expected *va-vr-uṣ-. The additional reduplicating
syllable may have been added because the root syllable is swallowed up in the weak
stem of the participle.</p>
<h3 id="i1736">I.173.6</h3>
<p>Pāda-final bhū́mā with long -ā must nonetheless be sg., as Old points out.</p>
<h3 id="i1737">I.173.7</h3>
<p>For -ín-stem superlative prapathíntama-, found also in VI.31.5, and
prápatha- (4x, incl. nearby I.166.9), to which it is built, see comm. ad I.166.9.
Pāda c is problematic. The standard tr. take kṣonī́ḥ as subject, but this is
grammatically problematic: kṣoní/ī́- is fem., but the subj. of c is the most likely
referent of masc. yé in d. The gender disagreement disturbs both Ge and Old; the best
solution they can come up with is a constructio ad sensum. I therefore take kṣoṇī́ḥ as
acc. pl. The problem then is the absence of a verb &ndash; a problem also for those who
take kṣoṇī́ḥ as nom. Ge uses the infinitive paritaṃsayádhyai from b, but I am
reluctant to assume that kind of enjambement. Both Re and WG seem to do without a
verb, allowing pāda c to dribble off unfulfilled into the rel. cl. of d. I supply a verb
like ‘direct, send’, with no confidence in its correctness. As for the subj., I take it to
be the warriors referred to by samátsu … satā́m in pāda a, although Old considers
this gekünstelt. If, on the other hand, kṣoṇī́ḥ is the subj., I would tr. “the battle cries
[=opposing sides] (call out) to Indra …”
Ge takes sūríṃ cid as a simile, with cid as the simile marker. As I’ve said
elsewhere, I don’t believe that cid ever has that function, a view in which I am joined
by Old, I’m happy to say. (See his remarks on this passage.) The point here is rather
that the people call upon Indra as a fighter in battle, but also call him a patron when
he distributes the prizes won in battle: he fills both roles.</p>
<h3 id="i1738">I.173.8</h3>
<p>Ge’s assessment that the vs. refers to the mixing of soma with water (a) and
milk (b) seems correct. As often in soma contexts, the rhetoric is high-flown and the
real-world references indirect.
The āsú of b must anticipate the cow(s) of c; it is presumably accented
because its referent has not yet appeared in the discourse.
Both Ge and Re endow the gerundive jóṣyā with caus. pass. value ‘to be
satisfied’ (“Jede zu befriedigende Kuh,” “Toute vache propre à être satisfaite”), but
even the “causative” joṣáyate doesn’t have this value, but simply means ‘enjoys’.
The cows are surely there for Indra to enjoy them, not for him to labor to give them
enjoyment.
Note that the idiom ánu √mad ‘applaud’ found in anumádanti in 7d is broken
down into its components, with mádanti in our pāda b and ánu in c.

<h3 id="i1739">I.173.9</h3>
<p>The yáthā purpose clauses of this vs. are to be roughly construed with the
initial evā́of 8a.
Inspired by Ge, I read instr. ena in two different ways, as accompaniment in
pāda a and as indirect agent in b.
Note also the decomposed narā́ṃ ná śáṃsaiḥ (also 10a) recalling nárā-śáṃsa-.
For further disc. of these expressions see comm. ad II.34.6 and VI.24.2.
The curious hapax vandane-ṣṭhā́- ‘standing on praise’ must be a play on the
phonologically similar, likewise hapax vandhure-ṣṭhā́- ‘standing on the chariot box’
(III.43.1), which is modeled on the venerable rathe-ṣṭhā́- ‘standing on the chariot’,
two forms of which appear earlier in this hymn (4d, 5b).
The part. náyamāna(ḥ) is identical to the form in 3c, but there the part. is
clearly passive, and here such a reading is well-nigh impossible to impose. WG’s tr.
has a self-beneficial meaning, “indem er (seine) Preissprüche mit sich führt,” but
even that seems contextually difficult &ndash; although I guess any praises Indra “leads”
are ultimately for him. For leading song, see gāthā-nī́- (I.190.1 [also
Agastya],VIII.92.2), the latter also of Indra.</p>
<h3 id="i17310">I.173.10</h3>
<p>The vs. describes the competition between rival sides (either in battle or in
ritual or both) to secure Indra for their side. I take it as depicting much the same
situation as in vs. 7 (esp. 7b), where Indra is the object of a tug-of-war
(paritaṃsayádhyai). I therefore interpr. Indra also as the target. of madhyāyúvaḥ
‘seeking (one) in the middle’ in 10d, contra Ge (/WG) for whom Agastya is the
middle-man, the mediator.
My interpr. of the vs. requires some rearrangement of the elements, most
particularly the phrase narā́ṃ ná śáṃsaiḥ, which I construe with the simile in c &ndash;
parallel to yajñaíḥ in the frame in d. Although this displacement may seem radical,
neither Ge’s “Im Wetteifer geratend wie durch das Lob der Herren …” (sim. WG)
nor Re’s “(Soyons) en rivalité comme par l’effet des paroles-qualifiantes des
seigneurs …” makes any sense to me.
This passage is one of the comparatively few where a real modal value of the
subjunctive might be preferable to the expectant future: “let/may Indra be ours,”
rather than the publ. tr. “Indra will be ours.” Perhaps adjusting the English to “shall
be ours” will do the trick. The subjunctive may express the speakers’ certainty that
their sacrifices will be successful and exercise control over Indra’s actions. This
seems to be the point of the next vs.</p>
<h3 id="i17311">I.173.11</h3>
<p>As indicated in the publ. intr., the syntax of this vs. mimics the meandering
attributed to the finally successful sacrifice and the long road that brings a man home.
One of the striking features of the word order (at least in my interpr. and Ge’s) is that
índram behaves almost like a Wackernagel’s Law clitic, in taking modified 2nd
position in pāda a, though it is to be construed with ókaḥ … ā́kṛṇoti in cd. One factor
that might impede that interpr. is that, as Old points out, the finite verb kṛṇoti in d is
not accented, despite the hí in pāda a. Old feels that the end of the verse is no longer
governed by hí. I would suggest rather that the rambling road the vs. has traveled
from its beginning, including two complex similes, led the poet to forget or dismiss
the hí with which he began.
I take juhurāṇá- to √hvṛ / hru ‘go crookedly, go astray’ (with Ge and Re, as
well as Gr), rather than with √hṛ ‘be angry’ with Insler (JAOS 88, 1968), apparently
followed by WG: “wenn es (das Opfer) auch erzürnt im Denken Umwege macht.”
The parallel participle pariyán ‘going around, meandering’ supports this
identification, and it is somewhat difficult to imagine why/how a sacrifice would be
(or make) angry. Agastya uses the same participle in the same sense in I.189.1.</p>
<h3 id="i17312">I.173.12</h3>
<p>The first pāda, beginning with a mā́prohibitive, lacks a verb, but something
like “(get) us (involved) / (drag) us (into)” is likely. Perhaps Agastya delicately
omitted it to avoid insulting Indra too explicitly.

with rā́jā (e.g., Ge “Du, Indra, bist der König über alle Götter,” which entails not
only assuming that rā́jā can govern such a clause, but also ignoring the ca). Within
the same general interpr. framework WG do try to account for the ca: “… der König
über (alle), auch die die Götter sind.” This can all be avoided by interpr. the rel. cl. as
part of the familiar syntagm “X and which Y,” but in an inverse version with the
conjoined rel. cl. first (rather like the inverse Vāyav Indraś ca construction with the
ca constituent first ): yé ca devā́ḥ, … nṝ́n. Re, fld by Klein (DGRV I.127), does
interpret it as an “X and which Y construction,” but supplies a gen. “of mortals” with
rā́jā: “… le roi (des hommes) et de (ceux) qui (sont) les dieux.” This is unnec.
because rákṣā can govern the conjoined NP. It is accented because it opens the pāda.
Another intricate “X and which Y” construction is found in vs. 3 (by my interpr).
WG unaccountably take rákṣā absolutely and construe nṝ́n with pāhí, which is
ungrammatical because pāhí is accented; its object (asmā́n) follows.

<p>The derivation of the 2nd sg. verb dánaḥ is unclear. Most (see EWA s.v.
DAMI
) associate it one way or another with √dam ‘tame, subdue’ &ndash; beginning with
Sāy.’s gloss adamayaḥ. Old and Ge suggest that there is a by-root dan beside dam;
Re (GLV 81) concurs that it belongs to a “fausse racine,” probably generated from
athematic forms where the root-final would have been followed by an ending
beginning with a dental (type 2nd-3rd sg. ágan to √gam). Bloomfield (153) suggests
it’s a nonce blending of √dam and √han. I wonder if it is not the detritus of the
expected 9th cl. pres. *damnā́ti, which would be cognate with nasal presents
elsewhere in Indo-European and is the stem underlying attested damāyá- (&lt; *d(a)mn-H-yé/ó-) and damanya-. In our 2nd sg. injunc., expected *damnā́s, the interior nasal
cluster could have been simplified and the whole remodeled as a thematic form
(unfortunately requiring also accent retraction). In fact, *damnā́ti might not be the
expected form; a reconstructed *dm-ne-H-ti without restoration of a full-grade root
syllable should yield *danā́ti, which would have lost its obvious root connection with
√dam and could without too much difficulty be remodeled to the thematic stem we
appear to have. The 9th class ramṇā́ti would have pursued a different remodeling path.
In a n. WG suggest an unlikely deriv. from √dā ‘divide’, with an *-énonominal suffix, hence “Der ist Abtrenner des nachlässig redenden Stammes,” taking
the nominals as gen. sg. rather than acc. pl. (as is grammatically possible). The only
advantage I see to this is that it works better with the ostensible 3rd sg. dárt in b, but
there are other ways to handle that form.
As was just noted, the verb of b, pāda-final dart (√dṛ), appears to be a 3rd sg.,
in an otherwise 2nd sg. vs. It also ends in a (more or less) illicit cluster (-rt, with nonradical -t). With Old I assume that the original form was *daḥ (&lt; *dar &lt;*dar-s). A
final -t was falsely restored, possibly redactionally, on the basis of the identical pāda
in VI.20.10c, where the 3rd sg. is appropriate and the sandhi situation favors the
retention of the -t.
Note the phonetic play in #rṇ̥ ór &hellip; árṇā(ḥ)#.
Purukutsa is chronologically out of place here. Elsewhere he is a semihistorical figure, the father of Trasadasyu and a contemporary of Sudās, so Vrtra ̥
should be out of his league and his time period. But he does figure in VI.20.10,
immediately after the pāda identical to our b: VI.20.10d hán dā́sīḥ purukútsāya
śikṣan “He [=Indra] smote the Dāsa (clans), doing his best for Purukutsa,” where the
action described can be contemporary (or in the immediate past) and therefore
chronologically possible. I think it likely that Purukutsa has been imported from
VI.20.10 to anticipate the more properly mythological Kutsa in vs. 5. These two
agreements with VI.20.10 support each other and are good evidence for the
dependence of our vs. on that vs.</p>
<h3 id="i1743">I.174.3</h3>
<p>Ge suggests that the śū́ra- in śū́rapatnīḥ ‘whose lord is a champion’ is Indra
himself, which seems correct.
Ge (/WG) takes vṛ́taḥ … dyā́ṃ ca as the conjoined obj. of ájā ‘drive’; the two
objects are then picked up by yébhiḥ (Ge: “Führe die Heere … und den Himmel, mit
denen …”). The problem (besides the question of whether it’s possible or desirable
to drive heaven anywhere) is that vṛ́taḥ is fem. pl. and dyā́m is masc. sg., and yébhiḥ
is neither one. I follow Old’s interpr., also adopted by Re, that sees an “X and which
Y” constr. &ndash; with the twist that the ca does not follow the rel. prn. (as in yé ca devā́ḥ
in 1a), but precedes it, with another part of the rel. cl. fronted around it (dyā́ṃ ca
yébhiḥ).
By either interpr. the rel. cl. lacks a verb. Old, Re, and I supply ‘gain, conquer’
with heaven as obj. (And in keeping with the constant theme of these Agastya hymns,
I assume the referent of yébhiḥ is the Maruts; Old simply “die Leute”; Re doesn’t
specify.) Ge [/WG] “verbündet bist,” which seems kind of lame.
Initial rákṣo in c is Pragṛhya in the Pp., presumably 2nd sg. impv. rákṣa + u.
The standard tr. take aśúṣaṃ tū́rvayānam as two PNs, but I see no reason to.
As noted in the comm. ad I.101.2, aśúṣa- is otherwise only used of the demon Śuṣṇa,
but this strong association surely results from their phonetic similarity. Semantically
it fits Agni quite well. As for tū́rvayāna- it is sometimes a PN (e.g., I.53.10), but its
first member must be based on the verb stem tū́rvati ‘go in triumph’ vel sim., and the
literal sense of the compound is appropriate for Agni. See the very similar analytic
phrase VI.15.5 tū́rvan ná yā́man “like the one going in triumph on his course,” where
Agni is the referent.
There is difference of opinion on how the simile works in d. Flg. Old, Re, and
the line of least resistance, I resupply the verb rákṣa from c, maintaining Indra as
subj., compared to a lion. Ge (/WG) take the subj. as Agni and then must supply
another verb, not available in the context. This seems like too much machinery to me,
since the pāda is readily interpretable on the syntactic pattern in c.</p>
<h3 id="i1744">I.174.4</h3>
<p>Ge takes ab as a direct quote (uttered by unidentified speakers). He
presumably does this because of the difference in tense/mood (subjunctive vs.
injunctive) and person (2nd vs. 3rd) between ab and cd. But since such switches are
common in the RV, the direct speech does not seem necessary or contextually
supported.</p>
<h3 id="i1745">I.174.5</h3>
<p>One of the few “future imperatives” in the RV: vṛhatāt in c, following váha
in pāda a. Ge and Re also supply an impv. in b (“lenke,” “attele”), but this pāda
makes a fine nominal clause (so also Hoffmann, Inj., 190).</p>
<h3 id="i1746">I.174.6</h3>
<p>This vs. joins Indra’s overwhelming aggressive power with the moral force
of the three principal Ādityas. Those who offend against the strictures of the Ādityas
get utterly destroyed by Indra, in a partnership that one might expect to be more
prominent in the RV; X.89.9, adduced by Old, shows the same cooperative enterprise
in clearer form.
I take the pf. part. jaghanvā́n here as the equivalent of a pluperfect (in the
English grammatical sense), a past anterior, since there are no finite forms with that
function.
The standard tr. take both mitréru- and codá- as PNs. This is certainly the
easy, and tempting, way out. But both can be (and in my opinion should be) given
lexical weight. The easier one is codá-, a transparent derivative of √cud ‘bestir,
incite’. Gr’s interpr. of the compound (&lt; Roth), that codá- ‘inciting, goading’ is used
of soma, makes good sense in context, since Indra performs his feats of strength
under the influence of soma.
As for mitréru-, my interpr. is based on, but modifies, Old’s suggested mitrāī́ru- “die Mitra (zur Rache ihrer Treulosigkeit) in Bewegung setzen.” He seems to
envision the god Mitra being sent to punish the disloyal, but those who send Mitra to
effect this punishment should be on the side of good, not subject to Indra’s smiting as
here. I take mitra- here as the common noun ‘ally” and the -īr(u)- as expressing a
hostile dispatching of their erstwhile allies. Both those who dishonor their alliances
in this way and those who lack piety (ádāsūn, b) violate the norms of Ārya society
that are overseen by the Ādityas.
Although of the trio of principal Ādityas only Aryaman is named in this vs.,
Mitra lurks in the compound just discussed. Varuṇa, unnamed, is present along with
Mitra in the dual pronoun ayóḥ (in sácāyóḥ). Although the Pp reads āyóḥ and Ge
accepts this reading (though see his n. 6c), I follow Old’s alternative analysis (so also
Re, WG) and his identification of the two as Mitra and Varuṇa. I assume that “saw
before them Aryaman with those two” implies that the evil-doers have a vision of the
three Ādityas sitting in judgment (vel sim.) before Indra destroys them.
śūrtá- presumably belongs with śṛṇā́ti, etc., though the vocalism is surprising;
we would expect *śīrta-, like AV śīṛṇá-. [Add ref. to Clayton, when there is one.]</p>
<h3 id="i1747">I.174.7</h3>
<p>As often in a mythological context, kaví- by itself seems to refer to Uśanā
Kāvya. The previous mention (vs. 5) of Kutsa, often associated with UK, supports
this assumption.
arkásātau probably has a double sense. In the ritual context the arká- are the
chants (see nearby I.176.5), but in the mythological context supplied by vs. 5 (esp. c),
it can be the rays of the sun. So VI.26.3, which contains both UK and Kutsa.
“Making earth a pillow” is surely a euphemism for sending him to “his eternal
rest,” “putting him to sleep” among other such sayings. The “woeful womb” of d is a
similar expression. Both remind us of 4a “they will now lie in the same womb,”
clearly also referring to the grave.
Ge tentatively takes the referent of fem. “three” (tisráḥ) as rivers, and he is
followed by Re and WG. Although this identification handles the gender and the fact
that the adj. dā́nucitra- (3x) is once used of waters (V.31.6), it runs into the problem
that the canonical number of rivers is seven, not three. It is rather the divisions of the
world/earth that are regularly triadic; cf. fem. tisráḥ prthiv ̥ ī́ḥ (I.34.8), tisró bhū́mīḥ
(II.27.8). Although “bright with drops” may not be the most natural way of referring
to the three worlds, I think the numerology trumps the adjective &ndash; which could, in
fact, mean ‘bright with gifts’, not ‘drops’.
Ge takes the loc. mṛdhí as parallel to loc. duryoṇé (“in ein böses Nest, in
Missachtung”), and as so often he is followed by Re and WG; all of them also take
kúyavācam as a PN. But given mṛdhrávācaḥ ‘of scornful speech’ in 2a, it seems
better to give kúyavāc- lexical value and construe it with mṛdhí.</p>
<h3 id="i1748">I.174.8</h3>
<p>There is much disagreement about the first hemistich because of the
uncertain grammatical identity of several forms as well as a sandhi problem in pāda a
and a hapax in b. Let us begin with the sandhi problem. The clear neut. pl. sánā tā́
“those old (things [=deeds?])” that opens the verse seems rhetorically paired with
návyā ‘new’ towards the end of the pāda, but in its sandhi situation, before vowelinitial ā́guḥ, návyā should underlyingly end in -āḥ, a masc. nom. pl. or fem. nom./acc.
pl. (so Pp). Most standard tr. try to reflect this sandhi one way or another: Ge takes
the ref. to be nábhaḥ in b, which he takes as a fem. pl. root noun nábh-. But “These
are your old (deeds). New (clouds) have come” is, with all due respect to Ge, absurd.
Old takes both sáhaḥ and nábhaḥ of b (with better semantics than ‘clouds’ &ndash; viz.,
“neue Siege und Berstungen”) as the referent of návyā(ḥ), though he does show some
sympathy with Gr’s suggestion that návyā is the neut. pl. we want, in hiatus. Re
supplies “hymns” with návyā(ḥ) … nábhaḥ, which has no contextual support. Only
WG, at least by implication, allow the neut. pl. interpr.: “Alt sind diese deine
(Heldentaten), o Indra. Neue sind (gerade) (hinzu)gekommen.” I think this is the only
sensible way to interpret the passage: rhetorical patterning outweighs sandhi. The
same hiatus of návyā before a vowel is found in V.29.15 yā́… návyā ákarma, where
two vss. before (V.29.13) yā́… návyā kṛṇávaḥ essentially guarantees the neut. pl.
interpr.
The fem. pl. interpr. of návyā(ḥ) is even less likely if sáhaḥ and/or nábhaḥ are
not taken as fem. pl. root nouns. As already noted, Old does so take them, and Ge has
the same analysis of nábhaḥ, but not sáhaḥ, which he appears to take as a 2nd sg. verb
in imperatival usage. Re takes nábhaḥ as a fem. pl. adj. and sáhaḥ as the neut. sg. of
the s-stem; for WG sáhaḥ is a nom. pl. fem. to a root noun and nábhaḥ a gen. sg.,
also to a root noun, dependent on áviraṇāya. The lack of agreement on basic
grammatical identity almost reminds us of the interpretive chaos created by the Old
Avestan Gāthas. For my part I take both sáhaḥ and nábhaḥ as 2nd sg. injunctives &ndash;
sáhas as the only act. finite form of the thematic stem sáha- (though cf. part. sáhant-),
which is fairly well attested in the middle; nábhaḥ as the act. transitive corresponding
to med. intransitive 3rd pl. impv. nábhantām “let them burst,” found esp. in the
famous Nābhāka refrain (VIII.39-42). The fact that the next two pādas (8c, 8d) open
with 2nd sg. injunctives (bhinát and nanámaḥ respectively) and that I.173 is
characterized by pāda-initial 3rd sg. injunctives (see comm. above) supports the
verbal interpr.
As for the rest of pāda b, I supply ‘strongholds’ (púraḥ) from pāda c with
pūrvī́ḥ, as in, e.g., I.63.2, II.14.6. The hapax áviraṇa- I take as containing ráṇa- ‘joy’
/ ‘battle’, with both meanings in play in the cmpd. The form contains both the
privative a- and what I consider a pleonastic ví, both meaning ‘without’. Although
these elements might be expected to cancel each other out (“not without joy/battle”),
I think the ví is included to allow a buried pun on avī́ra-, suggesting “for their
unmanning” in addition to “for lack of joy / for non-battle [=end of battle].” The
godless are supplied from the 2nd hemistich.
After the travails of ab, the rest of the verse is fairly straightforward. I supply
víśaḥ ‘clans’ with ádevīḥ on the basis of the occurrence of this expression elsewhere
(e.g., VI.49.15) and take bhídaḥ (which, unlike the two -aḥ forms in b, I do interpr as
the acc. pl. of a root noun) as a kind of proleptic cognate acc. with bhinát: “split …
into smithereens.” I would in fact now substitute this more colorful expression for
the publ. tr. “split into pieces.”</p>
<h3 id="i1749">I.174.9</h3>
<p>This vs. is identical to VI.20.12. This connection, in addition to the identical
pāda I.174.2b=VI.20.10c establishes a relationship between the two hymns that
makes the dependence of dart in our 2b on the one in VI.20.10c more likely.
The apparent -si impv. betrays its origins as an s-aor. subjunctive by
appearing here in a subordinate clause, where impvs. are not licit.</p>

<p>Indra</p>
<h3 id="i1751">I.175.1</h3>
<p>The simile and frame in 1ab seem on the surface somewhat flat-footed, and
the standard tr. try to fix it one way or another. Both Ge and Re take the simile to be
máhaḥ, pā́trasyeva (e.g., Re: “telle la grandeur de la coupe-à-boire”), with mádaḥ the
frame (“A été-juste bu … le breuvage-d’ivresse …”). But this requires the simile to
straddle the pāda boundary, with the simile marker iva in the wrong place. I think it
is instead a sort of reverse simile, with the actual object (mádah ‘exhilarating drink”)
put into the simile and the element in the frame what one would expect it to be
compared to (máhaḥ ‘might’) “might has been drunk like an exhilarating drink.”
Such a poetic trick should not be utilized too often, but the reversal of expectations is
a bracing way to begin the hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i1754">I.175.4</h3>

<p>Pāda b contains a pleasing if elementary figure índram indo vṛ́ṣā viśa.
śátrum opening d is neatly positioned so that it can serve as obj. both to invasi
and to vindasi; note that these verbs rhyme and their root syllables are almost mirror
images of each other.</p>
<h3 id="i1762">I.176.2</h3>
<p>The syntax of the simile in cd is surprisingly intricate. First, though ánu
svadhā́m [/svadhā́m ánu] is a common syntagm (“following / in accord with (one’s)
independent will,” e.g., I.33.11, 88.6, 165.5), the two words are not to be construed
together here (sim. V.34.1). However, their common association probably accounts
for the displacement of the rel. yám to the right of svadhā́even though ánu governs
yám. Further, though yávam ‘grain’ in the simile logically matches svadhā́in the
frame (at least in my interpr.), they are in different cases: nom. and acc. respectively
(yáva- is masc. and must be acc.). The acc. is due to the fact that yáva- is several
times obj. of √kṛṣ ‘plough’ (I.23.15, VIII.22.6). Thus, though, given the way Sanskrit
similes work (with the verb held constant and the nominal elements matched), yávashould be nominative, the presence of the part. cárkṛṣat ‘ploughing’ has attracted it
into the acc. appropriate to the obj. of that verb. The various tr. treat this difficult
construction in various ways, but mostly bleach or manipulate the meaning of the
pass. upyáte in ways that seem illegitimate to me &ndash; starting with Gr, who glosses ánu
… upyáte first as ‘sich jemandem nachwerfen’ but then waters this down to
‘nachgehen, nacheilen’. Ge’s “dem die Svadhā nachzieht” essentially follows Gr’s
lead, an interpr. that makes nonsense of the simile (“wie der pflügende Stier der
Gerste”), since the animal ploughing does not follow the sown grain but necessarily
precedes it. (Without a ploughed furrow, there’s no place to sow.) WG give upyáte
its due lexical value, but this again twists the simile into semantic knots: as with Ge’s
interpr. the nom. bull (vṛ́ṣā) is made parallel to nom. svadhā́in syntactically
satisfactory fashion, but this means that the bull is being sown, which is not at all
semantically satisfactory: “dem hinterher die Svadhā gesät wird, wie der Stier der die
Gerste pflügt.” Only Re seems to manage both syntax and sense, though his tr.
introduces considerable machinery: “lui derrière qui (sa propre) autonomie est semée
comme (on fait en) labourant (le champ d’) orge, (lui que est) le dieu mâle.”
What the hemistich is conveying is another issue. I do not understand how
svadhā́- can be strewn. The picture evoked by the simile is of a powerful bull (not the
usual plough-animal &ndash; ideally they are more docile) pulling a plough, with lavish
amounts of grain being scattered in the resulting furrow. It could be that the svadhā́-
refers to the autonomous power of others, which gives way to (/is strewn down after)
the progress of Indra the bull. Or his own svadhā́- is metaphorically sown to bear
fruit in due course. But neither of these explanations do I find convincing.</p>

<p>This vs. has elicited an extraordinary amount of discussion and disagreement,
which cannot be fully rehearsed here. I will only sketch my own interpr., which is
closest to Old’s. I take the ā́vaḥ that opens the verse as the verb of the main clause
and the only surface word of that clause. The obj. ‘him’ (*tám), referent of the
following rel. prn., has been gapped, exactly as in 3c. The cmpd. sānuṣák in b I
analyze as sā́nu-ṣác- (rather than sa-ānuṣák- with Gr and others); it is a reference to
soma, which famously grows in the mountains. For detailed disc. of the cmpd and the
passage see Scar (594), though I cannot follow his suggestion that the 2nd member
belongs to √sañj ‘hang’ and refers to a quiver ‘hanging on the back’.
In d the publ. tr. “helped him to prizes” goes a little too fluently into English.
The loc. vā́jeṣu might better be taken as the usual truncated loc. absol. “when prizes
(were at stake).”
Most other tr. take c with ab, with d separate, whereas I attach c to d. There is
no way to tell, but I think the contrast set up here is between the ritual (signalled by
the loc. arkéṣu “at the chants”), where Indra will receive what he wants (soma), and
the contest (ājaú), where Indra’s client will do so.</p>

<p>The hemistich-internal enjambment in ab &ndash; … vṛ́ṣā te, sutáḥ sómaḥ … &ndash; is
noteworthy, esp. because b is a repeated pāda (VII.24.2b), and in its other occurrence
the pāda is syntactically self-contained. In fact, WG tr. the two pādas separately here,
with vṛ́ṣā in pāda a referring to Indra and te a gen. with rátham: “Auf deinen
stierhaften Streitwagen steige als Stierhafter.” This isn’t impossible, but the other
interpr. (fld. by Ge and Re) seems more natural.</p>

<p>Ge takes vástoḥ as dependent on vidyā́ma (“Wir Lobsänger möchten … den

in nearby I.179.1). I think rather that vidyā́ma simply anticipates the identical verb
that opens the refrain pāda. For further disc., see comm. ad VI.24.9, whose pāda c is
identical to our c (also X.89.17).</p>

<p>The crucial word śruṣṭí- is ambiguous: it may refer to the attentive hearing
Indra gives to our praises and desires or to the obedience (based on our “attentive
hearing”) that we have shown towards Indra. The publ. tr. reflects the first possibility,
but I think both may be meant, though Indra’s role as a hearer in 3b may support the
first interpr. The other exx. of śruṣṭí- are not clearly diagnostic.
Ge takes “us” (naḥ) as the implicit obj. of maháyantam (“der uns gross
macht”), but maháya- ordinarily takes a god (indeed ordinarily Indra) as obj., and
most tr. so render it.

<p>See publ. intro. for the mismatch in b between the dual subj. svásārā and the
pl. verb kṛṇávanta, with the possible semantic explanations given there (multiple
days and nights or multiple fingers on the two hands). It’s also worth noting that the
verb we expect, the middle 3rd dual athematic subjunctive, may not have been
thoroughly anchored in the poets’ Sprachgefühl, since relatively few such forms are
attested to any stem type. We should expect *kṛṇávaite (or -ete), which is not found,
though we once get kṛṇvaíte (VI.25.4) with the wrong grade of the suffix. In the
absence of a firmly established form in this slot in the paradigm, the poet may have
opted to fall back on a more familiar and easily generated one, the 3rd pl.
Gr assigns aveṣan to a separate root √viṣ ‘sich ergiessen’, not to the wellattested √viṣ ‘labor’. This division is tentatively accepted by Mayrhofer (EWA s.v.
VEṢ), argued for by Narten (s-aor., 245), and accepted by Gotō (1st class, 299). The tr.
of both Ge and WG reflect this analysis, though Re’s does not. Since ‘labor, toil’
works fine for the three forms that Gr assigns to this other root (nearby I.181.6 and
VIII.75.11 in addition to this one) and for the one added by Narten (X.114.1), I see
no reason to make the separation.

Pāda d has been variously interpreted. The major issue is what (if anything) is
the object of abhy ájāva, a problem made slightly more acute by the fact that abhí is
not otherwise found with √aj until the ŚB (see Ge n. 3cd), making it likely that it
owes its abhí to the parallel verb in 3b, abhy áśnavāva. Thieme’s solution (Gedichte
76) is the most radical: he makes the duals samyáñcā mithunaú the object: “wenn wir
die beiden [Heer-]Hälften dem gleichen Ziel entgegenführen,” seeing Agastya and
Lopāmudrā as leading two different wings of a metaphorical army. This is not
impossible, but the fact that the duals are so appropriate to be the dual subject makes
assigning them elsewhere seem somewhat perverse. Other tr. suggest other objects:
Ge, on the basis of ŚB II.3.3.16, supplies ‘ship’, Re (and WG) ‘chariot’ (WG
‘Rennwagen’). Re tentatively specifies “le char de la vie?”; I would suggest rather
the chariot of the sacrifice, given that that image is extremely common and that
Agastya seems to be trying to redirect Lopāmudrā’s energy into ritual pursuits.
However, I’m not sure that any object needs to be supplied; the publ. tr. reflects an
absolute usage ‘drive on’. Another small issue is the sense of mithunaú. For Insler
(Vedic mith, 165), it is used contrastively with samyáñcā: “if we, who are now
opposed, shall race on in harmony.” But the standard use of mithunaú to refer to the
complementary oppositional halves of a pair, esp. a married couple, makes this
otherwise appealing reading less likely.</p>
<h3 id="i1794">I.179.4</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., with the Anukramaṇī and Sāyaṇa as well as
Thieme, I take Agastya as the speaker of this vs., contra the standard modern
assignment to Lopāmudrā (Ge, Re, Doniger, WG). The question is of some
importance, because it determines the identity of the “me” whom desire has
overcome. I see the verse as expressing Agastya’s sudden surrender to his own latent
and then aroused sexual desire; others must see Lopāmudrā as continuing to assert
her desire as in vss. 1–2 to the chaste Agastya. But in that case I don’t see how the
sex would have taken place, since Agastya was unwaveringly against it in vs. 3.
Certainly assigning it to Agastya makes for a more psychologically complex portrait.
Crucial to the interpr. that assigns the verse to Lopāmudrā is the syntactic
function of the gen. phrase nádasya … rudhatáḥ and the meaning of the part.
rudhánt-. In the Lopāmudrā-speaker view the genitive is an objective genitive: “lust
for the náda- rudhánt- has come to me [=Lopāmudrā].” The participle then belongs
to √rudh ‘obstruct’ and refers either to Agastya’s ascetic self-control by withholding
his semen (Ge flg. Sāy, Doniger) or to his warding off the importunate advances of
his wife (WG). In the Agastya-speaker view the genitive is subjective and the
participle belongs to √rudh ‘grow, mount’. Although Re claims that ‘grow’ is
“faiblement attesté” for rudh, “feebly” isn’t “not,” and in any case the attestation is
more robust than Re seems to recognize. With the ‘grow, mount’ meaning, nádasya
… rudhatáḥ is a pun: the mounting bull (nadá-) and the growing reed (likewise
nadá-), with the latter a metaphor for the penis. For a somewhat indecisive disc. of
the possible meanings of the phrase see Old.</p>
<h3 id="i1795">I.179.5</h3>
<p>As Thieme points out, the last pāda, “for of many desires is mortal man,”
bears the mark of a popular saying, with the l-form pulu- in place of standard puru-
‘many’ in pulu-kā́maḥ. pulu- is found only once elsewhere in the RV, in pulv-agháin the Vṛṣākapi hymn (X.86.22), which also belongs to a more vernacular register.</p>
<h3 id="i180">I.180</h3>
<p>Aśvins</p>
<h3 id="i1801">I.180.1</h3>
<p>Contra Ge (/WG) I supply ‘honey’ as the obj. of pruṣāyan on the basis of
IV.43.5 … mádhu vām pruṣāyan, etc.; it can be recovered contextually from pāda d.</p>
<h3 id="i1802">I.180.2</h3>
<p>This is a difficult verse to construe, primarily because of the anomalous yád
that ends pāda a. It cannot (or should not) mark that pāda as a subordinate clause
because the verb nakṣathaḥ is unaccented. But if it is taken as marking what
immediately follows as a subordinate clause, this is awkward at best, because the gen.
phrase of b should simply specify the gen. átyasya in a. The Ge (/WG) solution is to
supply an acc. goal for nakṣathaḥ (“Schnelligkeit”), which is picked up by the yád
and the following genitive phrase: “reach (the speed) of the steed, which (speed) (is)
of the …” Old suggests that the yád that should subordinate pāda d has simply been
stuck in early at the end of pāda a for metrical reasons &ndash; an unlikely tyro’s error for a
skilled poet like Agastya and an interpretational hypothesis that essentially tells us
that all bets are off in Rigvedic syntax. This is not a worthy representative of Old’s
usual acumen. Re suggests either the Ge solution or an anticipation of the yád of c.
There is a much simpler solution, which avoids these syntactic contortions
and also avoids the need to supply an acc. goal with nakṣathaḥ or to allow áva √nakṣ
to take a goal in the genitive. The solution is to take yád (/yát) as the substantivized
neuter NA sg. of the present participle to √i ‘go’ (‘going’ à ‘movement’); for a
similar interpr. see āyát in III.55.8 and also vs. 3c below. It is the goal of the verb,
and the genitives of ab are dependent on it; there is then no syntactic break between
the pādas.
Contra Ge, I do not think that the first member of vípatman- is ví- ‘bird’, but,
with Gr, etc., the preverb ví-. The lexeme ví √pat is found elsewhere, incl. in an
Agastya hymn I.168.6.
Ge (sim. Gr, WG) suggests that the referent of the genitives is the
Sonnenrosse or Dadhikrāvan. This does not fit spatially with the áva ‘down’ of áva
nakṣathaḥ. I think rather of the ritual fire: Agni is often compared to an átya-; ‘of
wide flight’ would well describe the movements of the newly kindled fire; although I
could not identify an unambiguous example of nárya- referring to Agni, ‘belong to
men, manly’ is a reasonable description of his role; as is práyajyu- ‘foremost at the
sacrifice’, which is applied to Agni at III.6.2. Reference to the ritual fire also makes
sense in the context of the second hemistich where Dawn escorts the Aśvins to the
sacrifice and a ritual officiant (to be supplied) solemnly invokes (ī́ṭṭe) them. The root
√īḍ is essentially restricted to such ritual situations.</p>
<h3 id="i1803">I.180.3</h3>
<p>The construction of this vs. is, if anything, even more challenging than the
previous one, at least in its second half. As noted in the publ. intro., the first half
concerns the favorite paradox of the “cooked” milk coming from the raw cow. My
only deviation from the standard tr. is to take account of the odd position of áva in b,
which I take to signal a transition from a general statement about the paradoxical
nature of milk to a particular statement about the ritual situation. I re-supply
adhattam with áva, but here it refers to the deposit of the ritual milk down on the
ritual ground.
The problems lie in the 2nd hemistich, and the knottiest one is posed by the
apparent mismatch between the case of the simile and its supposed correspondent in
the frame. To allow Ge’s tr. to represent the standard, he takes yád in c as a neut. acc.
referring to the milk of the previous hemistich and functioning as obj. to yajāte in d
(roughly, “which (milk) the oblation-offerer sacrifices to you”). But the milk is also
compared to the undoubted nominative phrase hvāró ná śúciḥ &ndash; a discrepancy he
attributes to “Der Nom. statt Akk. im Vergleich,” a false explanation that I hope I
dispatched for good in my 1982 IIJ article on case disharmony in RVic similes (and
which Thieme [KlSch 79–80 n. 4 = 1951: 8–9] also excoriates him for, though
without an adequate alternative solution in my view). Another problem posed by this
interpr. (even for those who deal with the simile in another way) is that it requires
‘milk’ to be the obj. of yájate with vām then an oblique case, but √yaj (without
preverb) almost always takes an acc. of the divinity and an oblique case (generally
instr.) of the offering substance. (Gr gives templates with acc. of the offering, but the
passages supposedly conforming to them are few and far between.)
Again, a more radical approach to the text can eliminate the problems without
compromising the grammar. I suggest that yájate in d is not the verb of the rel. clause
introduced by yád in c, but starts a new cl., consisting only of yájate havíṣmān &ndash; a
simple statement ending a complex verse. The verb is accented because it opens its
clause. What precedes in cd is a nominal clause, with ‘milk’ as subject. It is possible
to assume that there is no verb at all but a gapped copula, but I actually think that
there is a haplologized present participle *yát following the rel. prn. yád (hence yád
*yád), again, as in vs. 2a, the neut. N/A pres. participle of √i ‘go’. Assuming a
haplologized monosyllable here fixes the meter, making a 10-syllable line into a
proper Triṣṭubh, with an opening of 5 and a fine break and cadence. Hence, the milk
“which (yád) is going (*yát) within (antár) the wooden cups (vanínaḥ).” With milk as
a nominative subject, the nominative simile is grammatically impeccable, without (in
the mode of Thieme [/WG]) having to apply it to the havíṣmān, which does not work
well. I believe that the “blazing twisting” entity is an image of a snake, but refers to
the snaking flames of fire, going into the woods. Thus vanínaḥ is read with both
frame and simile. In the publ. tr. “is (now) going” should be marked with an asterisk.</p>
<h3 id="i1804">I.180.4</h3>
<p>This vs. also presents a number of difficulties. The easiest to deal with is
avṛṇītam, the 2nd du. active imperfect, to the 9th class pres. to √vṛ ‘choose’, which is
otherwise only middle. We should hypothetically expect middle *avṛṇāthām, but in
fact, acdg. to Macdonell, no athematic present in Vedic attests such a form, whatever
the present class. The 2nd /3rd ps. middle dual forms seem to have been avoided. and
this active nonce form is probably modeled on 3rd singular medial impf. avṛṇīta,
which is fairly common and occurs a number of times in just this metrical position,
after an opening of 5 in trimeter verse. Ge (p. 258 n. 3) attributes the active voice to
the fact that the Aśvins are choosing on behalf of someone else; this is an ingenious
suggestion and merits consideration, but I think the formal problems tipped the
balance.
The real crux in this vs. is eṣé, which has received almost as many analyses as
there are RVic interpretors. For some of the various suggestions see Old ad loc., Ge’s
n. 4ab, Re ÉVP XVI ad loc., Scar (60–61), Keydana (Inf. 236 n. 135); there is no
space (and I have no patience) to discuss them all here. I take it as a dat. inf. to √iṣ
‘send’ + ā́, built directly to the root. This root identification may be supported by vs.
6 of the next hymn, I.181.6b pūrvī́r íṣaḥ … mádhva iṣṇán “sending many refreshing
drinks of honey,” with similar sense.
I take the simile apó ná kṣódaḥ as obj. of this inf., parallel to the gharma drink
that the Aśvins are sending here. With Gr, I take apáḥ as one of the rare sg. forms of
áp- ‘water’, preserved here in what is almost a deconstructed compound. For the gen.
with kṣódaḥ cf. I.112.12 kṣódasā-udnáḥ “with a gush of water.”
As for the 2nd hemistich, against the standard interpr. (incl. Old), I take cd as a
single clause. I supply “refreshing drinks” (íṣaḥ) as subj. of práti yanti with mádhvaḥ
dependent on it (not a nom. pl., per Gr), on the basis of the phrase cited above from</p>
<h3 id="i1816">I.181.6</h3>
<p>with íṣaḥ … mádhvaḥ. The goal of práti yanti is vām in pāda c. I take
páśvaiṣṭī with the simile, despite the pāda break and position of the simile particle:
ráthyeva cakrā́is a fixed phrase with the iva firmly planted within (cf. X.10.7–8, 89.2,
117.5). As for the form, the Pp reads nom. sg. -iṣṭiḥ (apparently fld by Ge, WG,
Scar); Gr suggests rather du. -iṣṭī. I also read -iṣṭī, but interpr. it as an instr. sg. or
even as one of the rare loc. sg. -ī to -i-stems (see AiG III.155). The parallel stem
gáviṣṭi- is primarily attested in the loc., though its sg. is the more orthodox gáviṣṭau
(pl. gáviṣṭiṣu).</p>
<h3 id="i1805">I.180.5</h3>
<p>Yet another near impossible verse.
The standard tr. take gór óheṇa as a phrase (e.g., Ge “durch Anpreisung der
Kuh(milch)”). This interpr. is favored by the adjacency of the two words and even
more by the retroflexion in óheṇa, which must be triggered by the final -r or gór and
speaks for a close syntactic bond. Nonetheless, in the publ. tr. I construe góḥ with
dānā́ya (“for the giving of a cow”), in part because pāda d (in my interpr.) identifies
the poet as lacking cattle and in part because “by praise of the cow” doesn’t make
much sense as a way to attract the Aśvins. However, the close sandhi of gór óheṇa
gives me pause, and I might change the publ. tr. to “With a laud of the cow might I
turn you here for giving.”
Thieme gives a complex, sensitive, and in many way appealing treatment of
this vs. in KZ 92 (1978): 40–42. In the first hemistich he takes dānā́ya as ambiguous,
between “for (our) giving (to you)” and “for (your) giving (to us).” The ambiguity is
also reflected in his double reading of góróheṇa: with a division gó róheṇa (already
suggested by Pischel), this can mean “by the rising of the milk” and refer to the
boiling up of the milk offered to the Aśvins in the Pravargya ritual. With a division
gór óheṇa it simply means “mit dem Ruf eines Rinde” and refers to the loud cry with
which Bhujyu summoned the Aśvins. Given Agastya’s seemingly limitless verbal
trickery, Thieme’s suggested double readings are certainly possible, though I wonder
if gór óheṇa needs to be confined to the simile, rather than referring to the cry with
which we attract the Aśvins.
The second hemistich is more contested. Most tr. take kṣoṇī́as dual acc,
which it of course can be, with the fem. adj. mā́hinā the subject and wanting a
referent: e.g., Ge (/WG) ‘help’ (ūtíḥ). I instead follow Thieme (and in fact Gr) in
taking kṣoṇī́here as nom. sg., and I read mā́hinā in two ways, as nom. sg. with kṣoṇī́
and dual acc. with vām (Thieme only the latter). Thieme also takes all of the 2nd
hemistich as referring to the story of Bhujyu, the Aśvins’ client whom they saved
from the sea. This allows him to take apáḥ as ablative sg.: “a cry from the water,”
where Bhujyu was languishing. I believe the Bhujyu reference is confined to pāda b,
though Agastya’s extensive treatment of the story in nearby I.182.5–7 gives me
pause and might lead me to reconsider. Meanwhile I take apáḥ in c as gen. sg., as in
4b. Note the similarity between 4b apó ná kṣódaḥ and 5c apáḥ kṣoṇī́. In my interpr.,
pāda c is parenthetical, describing the noise that attends the Aśvins’ journey,
produced both by their quick progress in the chariot and by the cries of us ritualists
seeking to bring them to us. I then take d as a return to the 1st sg. speaker of a(b) and
supply the verb from pāda a, ā́… vavṛtīya “might I turn you here.” My interpr.
depends crucially on Thieme’s ingenious (and to me convincing) analysis of ákṣu- as
‘without cattle’, formed in opposition to kṣumánt- ‘having cattle’, and containing an
underlying *p(a)śu-. (See EWA s.v. ákṣu2
; Mayrhofer accepts this analysis.) The
standard tr. are founded on ákṣu- ‘net’, found several times in the AV; Thieme
allows the possibility of a second reading with the ‘net’ word, which seems a bit
stretched.</p>
<h3 id="i1806">I.180.6</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., I take the 2nd hemistich as a punning depiction of
the poet’s patron, anchored by two adjacent and rhyming verbs that have double
readings, préṣad véṣad. The former is generally taken as the s-aor. subj. to √prī
‘please’ (Wh Rts, Gr, Narten [176], as well as the standard tr.), but it could also be
assigned to prá √iṣ ‘send forth’ (pace Re, who explicitly rejects this analysis) and
refer to the praiṣa- ‘ritual prompt’, a technical term in the later ritual but already
reflected in the RV, at least in my view (cf. purupraíṣa- I.145.3 and comm. ad loc.). I
think that both readings are present. Those who assign the form to √prī interpret it as
an unusual intransitive / reflexive (“becomes pleased, pleases himself”), in contrast
to the standard transitive use of the active forms of this root. But this is unnecessary.
The subject is the ritual patron (sūrí-), whose function is to distribute largesse to the
poet and priests. It is used without object here to enable both the √prī and the prá √iṣ
senses to be actualized. The same goes for the next verb véṣat. This latter verb is
generally taken also as an s-aor. subjunctive, to √vī ‘pursue’ (e.g., Gr, Narten [246],
as well as the standard tr.), and I agree that this is one of its readings. But I would
also take it as an injunc. to √viṣ ‘toil’, two forms of which are found nearby (I.178.2,
181.6). The two injunctive forms “gives the prompt and toils” express activities
strictly limited to ritual performance; the two subjunctives “will please and will
pursue” remain tied to the ritual but express its larger goals: “will please (the poet
and priests) and will pursue (the gods).”
Pāda d expresses the redistribution of goods that characterizes the Vedic ritual
system. The patron acquires goods, hence the ā́… dade ‘has taken’; in this case the
vā́ja- ‘prize’ must be the ‘abundance’ (púraṃdhi-) sent by the Aśvins in b. The gods
give these goods in response to the praises produced by the poets. The patron then
distributes these acquisitions to his clients, here the ritual functionaries who
prompted the gods’ gifts in the first place. There are several possible grammatical
analyses of mahé, but the dominant mahé is the dat. sg. to the athematic stem máh-.
Given the patronage situation depicted, I take it as short for mahé *rā́dhase “for great
(generosity),” as in I.139.6, II.41.6=VI.45.27, VIII.2.29, 24.10, 45.24, 64.12, 93.16.</p>
<h3 id="i1807">I.180.7</h3>
<p>The nonce verbal form vipanyā́mahe has attracted a remarkable amount of
discussion; for a detailed and clear summary see Kulikov (-ya-presents, 143–46),
though his passive/reciprocal interpr. I cannot follow. Insofar as there has been a
standard analysis of it, it has been as a passive to √pan ‘admire’ (Wh Rts, reflected
in Ge’s tr.), but other root associations and morphological analyses abound, which I
will not discuss further. It belongs with a group of other, better-attested formations:
fem. noun vipanyā́- and adj. vipanyú-, which I take as ‘admiration’ and
‘seeking/expressing admiration’ respectively. (This point was made forcefully by
Thieme in Fs. Risch [1986: 165–66], though I do not follow his ultimately
etymology.) (For a similar system, cf. vasūyá-(ti), vasūyā́-, vasūyú-.) I take
vipanyā́mahe as a denominative -yá-verb associated with these nominal forms,
derived from the root √pan (in my view); it is transitive in value and takes vām as
object. With Thieme (an analysis fld. by subsequent interpr. Kulikov WG), I take the
last part of pāda b, ví paṇír hitā́vān, as a separate nominal clause, but unlike these
interpr. I take it as the main clause attached to the causal clause beginning in pāda a.
The phonological play of vipan(yā́mahe) ví paṇ(ír) clearly contributed to the word
choice here, as Kulikov also notes. As for the sense of this hemistich, it simply
rephrases the purport of vs. 6: because we singers are doing our job in the ritual
economy by praising the gods, our patron is being generous to us and cannot be
labeled a ‘niggard’.
I.180.7–8: The poet then turns to the Aśvins’ part in this system and in 7cd presents
another causal clause, parallel to the one in ab. Note the parallel openings 7a vayáṃ
cid dhí and 7c ádhā cid dhí. This subordinated causal expression continues into vs. 8,
with another parallel causal clause occupying 8ab and introduced in a similar way: 8a
yuvā́ṃ cid dhí. In my, admittedly complex, interpr. of these verses, the 1st plural
singers of 7ab modulate into the single (3rd ps.) singer Agastya in 8cd; this
modulation is eased by not naming him until we reach the triumphant main clause of
8cd, where he boasts of the great wealth he has acquired from his poetry &ndash; just like
the singers of 7ab. And the transition from 1st ps. singers to 3rd ps. singer is enabled
by omitting both subj. and verb in 8ab, where a human ritualist or ritualists should be
the agents (see below) but where the ps. and no. of any verb would be
problematically telltale.
The series of causal clauses begins by highlighting the Aśvins’ benevolent
participation in the ritual system (7cd) and then the complementary activity of the
priest in summoning them to the sacrifice and offering to them first (8ab) &ndash; before
coming to the logical conclusion in 8cd: that Agastya has achieved his just reward
and is himself acclaimed among men.
With the standard tr. I take anindyā in 7c as a predicted voc., with c and d
separate clauses, as the double hí suggests.</p>
<h3 id="i1808">I.180.8</h3>
<p>Based on my interpr. of the structure of vss. 7–8, I supply Agastya as the
subject of 8ab, which not only lacks an overt subject but also an overt verb, for the
reasons sketched above. Ge supplies “(opferte er),” WG “(ruft man an)”; I favor
something like the latter (my ‘summons’), on the somewhat fragile basis that yuvā́m
is fairly frequently the obj. of √hū ‘call, summon’ (cf., e.g., I.47.4=VIII.5.17 yuvā́ṃ
havante aśvinā).
Curiously enough prá does not appear with verbal forms of √sru ‘flow’, but
the preverb probably indexes the ritual fact that Aśvins receive their offering at the
Morning Pressing, the ritual event that leads off the soma offerings of the day.
vírudra- is a hapax and difficult (but what is not in this hymn?), but with Ge,
etc., I take it as a bahuvrīhi ‘having Rudra (or rather the Rudras=Maruts) away’,
referring to soma. As Ge hints (n. 8b), this probably is a reference to the Agastya –
Indra – Marut cycle that forms such a dramatic part of Agastya’s oeuvre. It would
refer in part simply to the fact that this is the Morning Pressing, and the Maruts
receive their soma at the Midday Pressing. But also more specifically to the fact that
whether the Maruts should have any part in the soma sacrifice and whether in
particular they should have a share in Indra’s part were fraughtly disputed in those
hymns. Agastya is in effect pointing out that there was never any question of the
Aśvins having to share with the Maruts. (That by some accounts the Aśvins only got
included in the soma sacrifice belatedly might make this a question that would
exercise them.) The actual form, vírudra-, is reminiscent of the nominal clause ví
paṇíḥ … “the niggard is away” in 7b.
Pāda c is fairly straightforward, and it is worth noting that prá √śaṃs here is
used of a human (though not a king, unfortunately), reflecting what I think is its
original domain. There is some debate about the value of citayat, which belongs to
the functionally malleable stem citáya-. But in the absence of anything that could
serve as an object, I take it as the intransitive it regularly is, ‘appear, be conspicuous’.
As for sahásraiḥ, everywhere else where it’s clear, this instr. pl. refers to cows or
other countable forms of wealth (so also WG in n.), and I take it as indicating the
reason for Agastya’s perceived prominence.
Yet another hapax troubles us: kā́rādhunī. Both Ge and WG refuse to tr. it.
But given the other intractable problems in this hymn, it seems one of the lesser
issues. The 2nd member -dhuni- is surely dhúni- ‘noisy’ or probably, substantivized
‘noise, tumult’. It also seems reasonably possible to connect kā́rā- to kārú- ‘bard’
and assign it a tenative meaning ‘praise-song’ (so also EWA s.v. kārú-, citing also
AiG II.2, etc.). The form in the text (with probable but not certain -ī final, so Pp.) can
be an instr. sg. The remaining problem is the accent, which should make the cmpd a
bahuvrīhi, a grammatical identity at odds with my tr. “with a tumult of praise-songs.”
AiG II.1.221 simply says it has abnormal accent, and with nothing better to offer, I
will simply allow Wackernagel the last word on that subject. I take this simile with
what precedes (“proclaimed as if with …”) rather than what follows (“is conspicuous
by thousands as if by …”). Its position would allow either, despite the pāda break.</p>
<h3 id="i1809">I.180.9</h3>
<p>The phrase sūríbhya utá vā is elliptical. Klein (DGRV II.171) suggests
supplying ‘singers’, while I prefer ‘us’. Either is possible. Passages like sūríbhya
gṛṇaté (II.4.9, VI.4.8) favor Klein, while those like V.16.5 yé vayáṃ yé ca sūráyaḥ
favor my solution. The explicit 1st pl. in the next pāda (syāma) tips the balance in my
opinion.</p>

<p>On the thematic and punning ring composition of this vs. with vs. 1, see the
publ. intro.
In the finale of b, suvitā́ya návyam, návyam is at least superficially adverbial
and works well in that guise. However it’s worth nothing that suvitā́ya návyase with
two datives is found in Jagatī cadence in III.2.13, V.11.1, VI.71.3, IX.82.5, and I
imagine that ours is simply adjusted to the demands of Triṣṭubh (though we should of
course expect návyaḥ if this involved simple truncation).</p>

<p>Aśvins</p>
<h3 id="i1811">I.181.1</h3>
<p>The 2nd du (un)ninītháḥ, with primary ending, is formally problematic. It is
tentatively assigned to a redupl. pres. by Whitney, but there is otherwise no evidence
for such a pres., while the pf. is well established. Macdonell (oddly) calls it a pf.
subjunctive, but the mood sign of the subjunctive is absent. It can’t be an example of
simple avoidance of a paradigmatically shaky form, as in the case of *avṛṇāthām in
the preceding hymn (I.180.4), because the expected pf. indic. ninyathuḥ is actually
attested, with the same preverb (úd) and the Aśvins also as subject (I.116.8, 24). Kü
suggests (280–81) that the form is aiming to be an injunctive (that is, I assume, an
unaugmented pluperfect) meant to be distinguished from a putative imperative
*ninītám with 2ndary ending, and therefore it takes a primary ending (a solution
endorsed by WG). This seems needlessly complex and, pace Hoffmann (Injunc.,
111), I find the notion that an injunctive would adopt primary endings for this
purpose somewhat bizarre, since secondary endings are what define the injunctive. A
simpler solution is to assume the form is a nonce present generated to ambiguous
perfect forms like opt. ninīyāt (2x).
How to construe the genitives iṣā́ṃ rayīṇā́m and apā́m is another problem. I
take them as parallel partitive genitives, roughly flg. Old, rather than taking the
former pair as dependent on préṣṭḥau and the latter as a pseudo-ablative as Ge does.</p>

<p>The adjectival descriptor of the chariot ahampūrváḥ is transparently derived
from a nominal clause “I am in front / I’m ahead,” however unlikely this may be as
the utterance of a chariot.
The second hemistich consists entirely of a nominal relative clause referring
to the chariot, with two vocatives, the phrasal vṛ́ṣṇa sthātārā “you mounters of the
bull” in initial position and dhiṣṇi
yā near the end. The latter is commonly used of the
Aśvins (see, e.g., I.182.1c, 2a, in the next hymn). Here the voc. is followed by the rel.
pronoun yáḥ, which ends the clause. This is a remarkably odd position for a rel.
pronoun, and since this supposed rel. cl. consists of nominative qualifiers of the
subject of the main clause, ráthaḥ, it need not have been a relative clause at all: the
whole of the vs. could simply be a main clause. I think the yáḥ got stuck
pleonastically on the end of this pāda to provide a monosyllable to make a Triṣṭubh
cadence. (Cf. VI.63.6, a Triṣṭubh that ends dhiṣṇi
yā vām, likewise with a final
monosyllable.) No harm is done by this last-ditch conversion of the string of epithets
in cd into a nominal rel. clause, but it is a metrically driven afterthought in my
opinion. It should certainly not be taken as a standard ex. of rel. cl. word order.
The phrase mánaso jávīyān is an analytic version of manojū́- in 2c, there
applied to the horses, not the chariot.</p>
<h3 id="i1814">I.181.4</h3>
<p>Yet another troublesome dual verb form: avāvaśītām. It is generally agreed
(Wh Rts, Ge [more or less], Re, WG, Schaeffer [179–82], Kü [486–88]) that it
belongs to the root √vāś ‘bellow’. (Gr assigns it to both √vaś ‘wish’ and √vāś
without comment; for reff. to further lit. on this form see Schaeffer 181–82, Kü 487–
88.) But forms to that redupl. stem are overwhelmingly middle, while this form is
active. Whether it is assigned to the intensive (Schaef.) or the pluperfect (Kü), we
should expect a medial 3rd du. with secondary ending. However, as was already noted
with regard to avṛṇītam in the immediately preceding hymn (I.180.4), athematic 2nd
and 3rd medial duals are simply not attested, and in that case the 2nd du. active form
was substituted. I think the same thing happened here, and there is therefore no
reason to construct specifically active semantics for this form, as do WG.
Ge (fld. by Re and WG) supplies putráḥ with c as well as d and also takes
súmakha- as a PN, hence “(the son) of Sumakha.” These two decisions lead to the
interpretation that one of the Aśvins is of human origin, the other divine. So, most
clearly, Re: “Dissociation inattendue des Aśvins, l’un d’origine humaine, l’autre
divine.” This is a major and unnecessary interpretive leap, and based on dubious
though not impossible analyses of two details: there is no syntactic or rhetorical
reason to supply putráḥ in c, and súmakha- is ordinarily an epithet of gods; acdg. to
Mayrhofer (PN 102) this is the only possible passage in which it would be a personal
name and would refer to a human, not a god. Although this vs. does, unusually,
distinguish between the two Aśvins, I see no reason to ascribe human origin to one of
them on the basis of this passage, which is more naturally interpreted in another
fashion. It should be noted that Ge expresses some doubt about his interpr. in his n.
4c.</p>
<h3 id="i1815">I.181.5</h3>
<p>nicerú- is a hapax (though cf. céru- VIII.61.7). It almost surely belongs to
√ci ‘observe, discern’, with Debrunner (AiG II.860), despite Mayrhofer’s doubts
(EWA s.v. céru-). The Aśvins are themselves called nícetar- in nearby I.184.2.
The 2nd member rūpa- in piśáṅga-rūpa- seems pleonastic, but it perhaps
should have been rendered in tr., ‘whose form is tawny’, vel sim.
Pāda c causes several problems, both in grammar and in interpretation. To
start with the latter, anyásya is universally taken as referring to one of the two Aśvins,
as the paired anyáḥ-s of 4ab do. However, as noted in the publ. intro., I think the
referent of this stem has shifted. Both Aśvins together are referred to in the first
hemistich of 5, with the dual pronoun vām. They are contrasted with a new “the other”
in c, who can only be Indra: the presence of the two fallow bays (hárī) guarantees his
presence, since these horses are uniquely Indra’s.
The grammatical problem is the apparent number disharmony between the
dual hárī, if taken as the subject, and the pl. verb pīpáyanta; the accent of this verb is
also potentially problematic. The standard interpr. construe the pāda in this way (cf.
Ge “Die beiden Falben … sind … geschwellt”; so also Old, WG). The accent on a
main cl. verb is attributed to the anyá- (… anyá-) construction (so Ge, n. 5), though
he expresses some concern that in fact there’s only one anyá-. While it is true that
the first of two clauses in a double anyá- construction generally has an accented verb
(e.g., I.164.20, II.40.4-5, VI.68.3), this is not universal (cf., e.g., VI.57.2), and it is
not the case with single anyá-. But the real problem is that a plural verb should not
have a dual subject. Both these difficulties can be avoided if we supply a (dual) form
of √gam in c, generated from the precative gamyāḥ ending b, and start a new clause
with pīpáyanta, which then owes its accent to its clause-initial position. The plural
subject of this verb then includes both Indra’s pair of fallow bays (c) and the Aśvins’
tawny lead horse (a). (Ge [n. 5] somewhat similarly suggests that pīpáyanta is pl.
because the kakuhá- of 5a is also thought of [gedacht wird], but my suggestion
allows a grammatical solution, not merely a notional one.)
The adjective opening the next pāda would apply to all three horses and serve
as a further plural specification of the group. Although the Pp. reads du. -ā́, in sandhi
it can as well be pl. -āḥ. The stem of this adjective is uncertain. Sāy., followed by
Müller, reads mathnā́; Aufrecht, mathrā́. This is one of the relatively few variant
manuscript readings in the RV; see Müller vol. I, p. 62, Aufr. vol. II, p. iv., and Old
ad loc. On the basis of mathrā́in VIII.46.23, Old opts for mathrā́. This seems
reasonable, though in terms of sense which suffix we choose matters little, since
either form would most likely belong to √manth ‘churn, stir, shake’; used of horses, I
take it to mean ‘agitated, excitable, skittish’.
I supply a participle of a verb of motion with ví, which governs rájāṃsi. The
two parts of this phrase are separated by the intrusive voc. aśvinā. See 7b below.</p>
<h3 id="i1816-1">I.181.6</h3>
<p>This vs. is quite parallel to vs. 5: it begins prá vām, with a verb of motion in
the 2nd pāda to be construed with prá (gamyāh and carati respectively); the 3rd pādas
are identical save for their first word, X anyásya pīpáyanta vā́jaiḥ. I therefore
construe the vs. as I did vs. 5 with “lead horse” the subj. of ab, Indra the referent of
anyásya in c, and a new clause beginning with pīpáyanta. That the subj. of d is plural
gives support to my suggestion that 5d also contains a plural not a dual.
śarádvant- ‘having autumns/years’ in pāda a is a hapax, but presumably
means ‘having (many) years’ &ndash; thus ‘experienced’, of the lead horse.
As was noted ad I.178.2, I do not believe that we need a separate root √viṣ
‘sich ergiessen’ for three passages, including this one; ‘toil, labor’ works for all the
passages. My ‘roil’ here, besides conveniently rhyming with ‘toil’, is meant to
express the physical motion of the waters at work.</p>
<h3 id="i1817">I.181.7</h3>
<p>I do not understand why the song would be flowing ‘in three parts’
(/’threefold’; tredhá), nor is the meaning and referent of loc. bāḷhé clear. But
comparison with tribarhíṣi sádasi “on the seat with three (layers) of barhis” in the
next vs., 8b, may help. Assuming bāḷhá- belongs to √baṃh ‘be/make thick, firm’, we
can assign bāḷhá- the sense ‘thickened, plumped up’ and suggest that bāḷhé refers to
the barhis, which has been plumped up invitingly, like a sofa cushion, for the gods to
sit on, with its three layers ensuring a soft seat. As for tredhā́I now think it qualifies
not the song, as in the publ. tr., but the seat, and would now tr. “… flowing to the
(ritual grass) plumped up threefold/in three parts.” As in 5d the two parts of this
phrase bāḷhé tredhā́are separated by the intrusive voc. aśvinā.</p>
<h3 id="i1818">I.181.8</h3>
<p>The gen. phrase rúśato vápsasaḥ is standardly taken as the PN (Ruśant
Vapsas) of the singer. As often when a PN explanation is offered, this is a convenient
way of evading an unclear word or phrase. But rúśant- is a very well-attested adj.
with a clear sense ‘gleaming, bright’ and does not otherwise form part of a PN. This
leaves vápsas-, which I take as ‘wasp’ both here and in VIII.45.5 (girā́vápso, which I
divide as girā́vápso, contra Pp.; see disc. in EWA s.v. vápsas-). The resultant
“gleaming wasp” is, in my opinion, a description of fire; rúśant- is not infrequently a
descriptor of fire, and ‘wasp’ would refer to the random movements of flames and/or
the “sting” produced by flying sparks hitting skin. At least acdg. to the internet, one
of the most common species of wasp in South Asia is Ropalidia marginata (often
called the Indian wasp), a type of paper wasp that is remarkably flame-red in color,
and, in YouTube videos, a cluster of such wasps on top of their nest looks rather like
a flickering fire. Its sting is quite painful. Its “song” in this passage would either be
the sound of the crackling fire compared to the buzzing of the wasps or else simply
the hymn recited at the ritual fire.
The publ. tr. careless omits the vām; I would emend the tr. to “this very song
… swells for you …”
The second hemistich concerns the soma, in my view, though Ge and Re both
take the bullish cloud as an image of generosity and WG as morning mist. I take this
phrase as referring to the soma swollen with water after its soaking; this image is
then given both a real-world and a ritual sense, playing on two senses of gór ná séke.
In the real-world image the bull is depicted as sexually aroused (swollen) in mating
with a cow, lit. “at the insemination of a cow.” The root √sic frequently takes rétas-
‘semen’ as obj., and this is a shorthand way of expressing “at the pouring out (of
semen) into a cow,” vel sim. But in the ritual image, “at the pouring out of the cow”
refers to the pouring of milk and its mixing with the soma, a very common image
that is regularly sexualized.</p>
<h3 id="i1819">I.181.9</h3>
<p>This vs. seems to be trying to aggregate as many divinities into the final
summons as possible, and it does so rather awkwardly. On the basis of I.117.19 áthā
yuvā́m íd ahvayat púraṃdhiḥ “P. called upon just you two [=Aśvins],” I take
púraṃdhiḥ here as the separate (female) figure, rather than as an qualifier of Pūṣan
like Ge. Also on the basis of that passage I supply ‘summoned’ (generatable from
huvé in c) rather than making this part of the b clause with the verb jarate &ndash; though
very little depends on one or the other decision.
In c gṛṇānáḥ must be, quite unusually, transitive: it is ordinarily passive. I
think the transitive value for this medial participle was induced by its etymological
relationship with transitive jarate in b, mediated by the medial participle to that pres.
stem, which also takes the singer, not the besung, as subj. See the very similar
passage VI.62.1 aśvínā huve járamāṇo arkaíḥ “I call upon the Aśvins, singing with
my chants.”</p>

<p>On ā́√bhūṣ with vayúna- see VIII.66.8
The first hemistich addresses the ritual performers in the plural, as they make
final preparations for the sacrifice. Ge (fld. by WG) takes phrase rátho vṛ́ṣaṇvān “the
chariot has its bulls” as referring to the Aśvins’ chariot, which is presumably hitched
up and on its way. This is certainly possible, but I think the chariot may rather refer
to the sacrifice, as so often, and “its bulls” may be the Aśvins, who have arrived and
so the sacrifice can be set in motion, or they could be the priests or even the
paraphernalia of the prepared sacrifice. However, I have to admit that the next vs.
focuses on the Aśvins’ chariot (2cd) and their skill as charioteers (2b), so Ge’s
interpr. may be correct.
Ge takes mádatā in b as transitive, with the Aśvins, under the guise of the
various duals in cd, as obj. But máda- is rarely if ever transitive, and it seems best to
take cd as containing an annunciatory phrase pointing to the Aśvins’ presence (or
soon-to-be presence) at our ritual.
The hapax viśpálāvasū is presumably a bahuvrīhi, like vājínīvasu- ‘having
prize-winning mares as goods’, though Ge tr. as a tatpuruṣa, ‘die Gönner der
Viśpalā’. WG’s “mit (der Rennstute) Viśpalā als (ihrem) Gut” reflects the compound
type better and may well be correct. However, the cmpd must allude to the story (or
wisp of a story), found mostly in Kakṣīvant’s oeuvre, about Viśpalā and the Aśvins:
Viśpalā is a mare whose legbone the Aśvins stick back together so she can win a race.
The most relevant passage for interpreting this cmpd may be I.112.10 yā́bhir
viśpálāṃ dhanasā́m atharvyàṃ sahásramīḷha ājā́v ájinvatam “with which you
revived Viśpalā, to pursue the way, to gain the stakes in the contest with a thousand
battle-prizes.” (Cf. also I.116.15, 117.11, 188.8; X.39.8.) From these references to
Viśpalā it does not appear that she belonged to the Aśvins (was their “Gut”), but
rather was benefited &ndash; healed &ndash; by them in order that she could herself win goods in
the contest. Hence my more convoluted tr. “who provided the goods to (the mare)
Viśpalā.” The idea in our passage is presumably that they made it possible for her to
race and therefore to get the goods, so a lot is concentrated in that single cmpd.
I.182.2–3: The two 2nd dual middles, vahethe (2c) and āsāthe (3a), would both be
better metrically with light 2nd syllables. On this phenomenon, see Arnole 129–30. A
number of 2nd and 3rd dual middle forms invite this shortening. I do not understand it
historically since Aves. has the ā in the athematic forms and the equivalent of e in the
thematic ones (-aēte,- ōiϑe).</p>
<h3 id="i1822">I.182.2</h3>
<p>The two cmpds índratamā and marúttamā, superlative in form, are generally
taken to mean ‘most similar to Indra / the Maruts’ (Gr, Ge, WG). I suppose that is
their ultimate purport, but I think the effect is stronger: the Aśvins are said to possess
the qualities of those gods in an even higher degree than those gods themselves do.
Idiomatic English would use the comparative: “more Indra than Indra” (or, in a wellknown colloquial expression, at least in my childhood, “more Catholic than the
Pope”).</p>
<h3 id="i1823">I.182.3</h3>
<p>The sense of pāda a would be better conveyed by “what are you doing there?”
The main cl. kím āsāthe lacks an expressed antecedent to jáno yáḥ in the
following rel. cl., but it is not difficult to supply.</p>
<h3 id="i1825">I.182.5</h3>
<p>The story of Bhujyu, son of Tugra, is treated in I.116.3–5, also a Kakṣīvant
composition. (See also Agastya’s mention of it in nearby I.180.5.) Bhujyu was
abandoned by his father in the middle of the trackless sea; the Aśvins make a boat for
him and bring him home. Just as here, the boat(s) is(/are) described in I.116.3 as
ātmanvánt- and in I.116.4 as having wings. The former is generally tr. as ‘breathing’
(atmend, WG) or ‘possessing a soul’ (beseelt, Gr, Ge). I wonder rather if the ‘body,
trunk’ sense of ātmán- is at issue here, and it refers to a boat with a cockpit or
hollowed-out well for sitting, rather than a flat raft. The “paunchy” (if that’s what it
means and if it refers to the boats) in 6c would support this interpr. The wings would
then be sails. (The latter is an easy transfer; e.g., in English sailing downwind with
the mainsail on one side and the jib on the other is referred to as “wing and wing.”)
Of course, I am not denying that the Aśvin-made vessel did actually fly (see pāda d),
but I do suggest that there’s a germ of realia in the description &ndash; and that a boat with
a body makes more sense than a boat with a soul.
With most interpr. I take supaptanī́as an instr. sg. to a fem. nomen act.; see
Old’s exx. of similar phrases with a verb and su-compounded cognate instr. It is
perhaps worthy of note that the new-style weak pf. pet- coexists here with the old
style redupl. -papt-.</p>
<h3 id="i1826">I.182.6</h3>
<p>The construction and meaning of the last two words of pāda c, jáṭhalasya
júṣṭā(h), are uncertain. Ge (/WG) and Re construe the gen. with júṣṭā(ḥ), though Re
readily admits that júṣṭa- never elsewhere takes a genitive. He does not comment on
the meaning or reference of jáṭhala-, but Ge (/WG) takes it as referring to the
“bauchig (Wagen)” of the Aśvins; Ge further comments, “Die Schiffe trugen den
grossen Wagen der Aśvin oftmals über das Meer.” This conjures up a ridiculous
image, of four ships towing a bulbous wagon across the water like a water-skier or a
barge &ndash; a wagon that, moreover, we have no evidence for either in this hymn or in
the other passages concerning Bhujyu. (In the fullest treatment, I.116.3–5, the Aśvins
carry him with their ships [naubhíḥ, 3a] after Bhujyu has mounted a ship [nā́vam
ātasthivā́ṃsam]. There are no wagons, bulbous or otherwise.) And further, not only
the case frame with júṣṭā but its sense would be very peculiar; Ge tr. “die des
bauchigen (Wagens) gewohnt sind” (not the usual sense of júṣṭa-), WG “die dem
bauchigen (Wagen) angenehm sind.” What would it mean for the ships to be “used to”
or “agreeable to” a wagon? (Ge tries to get out of this difficulty by setting up a
veritable towing service, operating “oftmals.”) This can all be avoided by separating
the two words and interpr. jáṭhalasya as a genitive of description, ‘of paunchy
(shape)’, applicable to the boats, which, as noted with regard to 5b, would support an
interpr. of ātmanvánt- there as ‘possessing a body’. The one to whom the ships are
júṣṭa- ‘agreeable, welcome’ is then Bhujyu, who had been floundering in the sea and
would surely be cheered at the sight of them.</p>
<h3 id="i1827">I.182.7</h3>
<p>With Gr, etc. (incl. Scar, p. 648) I take níṣṭhita- to √sthā + nís, not ní.
Ge seems to take paryáṣasvajat either as contrary-to-fact in a rhetorical
question or as a true anterior pluperfect, but as Kü points out (591–92), the pf. of
√sva(ñ)j is presential, so the pluperfect is simply a past tense. The form is anomalous
in several respects. First, it has a retroflexed initial, despite following -a-, but this is
easily accounted for: the verb is always accompanied by the preverb pári, and the
retroflexion has simply been carried over into this environment. (This is the only
place where the verbal form doesn’t immediately follow the preverb.) The root is
also otherwise middle in inflection: pres. pári ṣvajate (5x, beside 1x act. pariṣvájat
VI.60.10, q.v.), pf. pári ṣasvaje (4x). But our plupf. is active; it also has apparent
thematic inflection (expect *áṣasvak). These two morphological features are highly
reminiscent of the aduhat-type actives built to old t-less middle presents of the type
duhé, with expected t-less imperfect *aduha, remarked with the act. -t ending – so
brilliantly analyzed by Wackernagel long ago. It seems that the pf. ending of ṣasvaje
was analyzed as (if) a primary ending, with a corresponding secondary -a, which
then required remarking.
parṇā́has a double reading: in the frame ‘leaves’ (of the rescuing tree in ab),
in the simile ‘feathers’, as Ge (n. 7c) points out.
The mṛgá- seems to be specifically a wild bird, like its Avestan cognate
mərəγa-.
Ge tr. śrómatāya kám as “(euch) zum Ruhme”; that is, the Aśvins will accrue
fame from their rescue of Bhujyu. This is certainly possible, and the stem śrómatadoes mean ‘fame’ once elsewhere (cf. VIII.66.9), though it usually means, by my
interpr., ‘attentive hearing’ (VI.19.10, VII.24.5). Here also I take it to mean
‘hearing’: ‘for hearing’, that is, for the story to be heard. WG tr. “zur Gehorsamkeit”
and in the n. specify that it is Bhujyu who should be obedient. Since as far as I now
Bhujyu hadn’t been disobedient, and certainly not to the Aśvins, I don’t understand
the interpr., esp. as śrómata- doesn’t elsewhere mean ‘obedience’.</p>

<p>Given its position, I do not think that ánu is a preverb in tmesis with
tíṣṭhathaḥ (with Gr and apparently Ge [/WG]), since such preverbs usually move to a
metrical boundary (or directly after the verb). Re suggests that we should supply
vratā́ni, after ánu vratā́ni in 3b, but doesn’t provide a tr. or give any indication of
what the whole would mean. However, I think his instinct is correct, that ánu
implicitly governs an acc. with the meaning “following/according to X.” The X is, in
my view, to be found in krátu-mant- ‘having resolve’; the construction is a blend of
this possessive adj. and an underlying ánu *krátum (cf. VIII.63.5, though the phrase
is not as common as I’d expected). Pāda-final pṛkṣé is infinitival, like iṣayádhyai in
3c.</p>

<p>The first hemistich shows a nice phonological progression (noted also by

varktam in b, which is followed by the rhyming impv. dhaktam. In the 2nd hemistich

Given the well-established idiom práti √dhā ‘aim (a praise-hymn like an

you,” particularly in light of VII.73.1 práti stómaṃ devayánto dádhānāḥ “aiming our
praise song as we seek the gods.” The pādas preceding these two expressions,
I.183.6a and VII.73.1a, are identical. For further disc. of the ‘aim’ idiom see my

<p>The form éṣṭā is generally taken as the ppl. to √iṣ ‘wish, desire’ + ā́(so Ge

noted that √iṣ ‘desire’ is not otherwise attested with ā́in the RV. I prefer the interpr.
of Gr, fld. by Pirart (Les Nāsatya I: 385), which assigns it to √yaj ‘sacrifice’. The
lexeme ā́√yaj is quite common and means ‘bring here/attract by sacrifice’, which
fits the passage well.</p>
<h3 id="i1843">I.184.3</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., this vs. is rather puzzling. In the first hemistich
the simile involving arrow-makers seems to have little to do with the content of the
frame regarding the bridal procession of Sūryā. Nonetheless I think the two activities
are related and, rather than supplying a verb ‘came’ to govern vahatúṃ sūryā́yāḥ,
with Ge (/WG), I follow Old’s interpr. (with Re). Old pulls the verb ‘make’ out of
the root-noun cmpd. iṣu-kṛ́tā ‘arrow-makers’ and supplies a transitive form of the
root to govern vahatúm: “… wie zwei Pfeilverfertiger (den Pfeil zum Glückschuss
zubereiten, bereitet ihr) o zwei Nāsatyas, als Götter die Brautfahrt der Sūryā.” This
interpr. is supported by the fact that forms of √kṛ regularly govern vahatúm: VII.1.17
ubhā́kṛṇvánto vahatū́…; X.17.1 tváṣṭā duhitré vahatúṃ kṛṇoti; X.85.14 syonám
pátye vahatúṃ kṛṇusva; cf. also X.32.3 puṃsá íd bhadró vahatúḥ páriṣkṛtaḥ with a
ppl. The connection of these two semantically ill-assorted activities, arrow-making
and bridal-procession-making, is facilitated by two features of the passage. On the
one hand, iṣu-kṛ́t- is reminiscent of íṣ √kṛ ‘make ready, set right’, with the pseudopreverb íṣ-. On the other, śriyé can be read in slightly different senses with simile
and frame. As Old points out, Pischel already compared X.95.3 íṣur ná śriyé with our
śriyé … iṣukṛ́tā. (Though I should point out that I read gen. śriyaḥ contra Pp. in
X.95.3, the association remains.) In our passage the Aśvins are compared with those
who make arrows “for glory” (in battle vel sim.), whereas they ready the bridal
procession “for beauty” &ndash; both senses being within the normal range of the
multivalent śrī́-. I would therefore now add to the publ. tr. “… (make ready) the
bridal procession of Sūryā for beauty.”
The second hemistich is more problematic. Ge (/WG) takes c and d as
separate clauses and in c Ge reads apsú twice, once as the location of the action of
the verb (“Es schweben … auf dem Wasser”) and once with jātā́ḥ (“die
Wassergeborenen”). Ge (/WG) then takes d as a nominal clause, “Abgenutzt sind die
Joche wie die des reichen Varuṇa.” Such a statement seems not only like an utter non
sequitur (what do Varuṇa’s worn-out yokes have to do with the Aśvins or their
horses?), but also puzzling on its own (what are Varuṇa’s yokes, worn out or
otherwise?). Moreover, as Ge, etc., point out, there is evidence from parallel
passages that c and d belong together, since jūrṇá- appears in an uncannily similar
passage about the Aśvins’ journey: I.46.3 vacyánte vāṃ kakuhā́so, jūrṇā́yām ádhi
viṣṭápi “Your lead (animals) twist and turn upon the (sea’s) broken surface.” Thieme
(rev. of Lüders, Varuṇa I [ZDMG 101 (1951): 411 n. 2 = Kl. Sch. 646 n. 2])
produces a tr. that puts the two pādas together: “in Sprüngen gehn eure &hellip;
Spitzentiere, die in den Wassern des vielfachen (reichen?) Varuṇa (d.h. im
himmlischen Meere) geborenen, über die gleichsam gealtertem (d.h. von Rissen
durchfurchten und deshalb unwegsamen) Joche (=d.h. Wegstrecken von der Länge je
eines Vorspannes … ).” Though I do not follow it in all regards (he construes
váruṇasya with apsú), his interpr. is considerably more convincing than the twoclause solution. He takes yugā́not as ‘yokes’, but as “Wegstrecken von der Länge je
eines Vorspannes” (rather like yójana-), hence the surface on which the horses
vacyánte. The ‘worn’ (jūrṇā́) surfaces of Varuṇa are then, with Old, the waves of the
sea, here called Varuṇa, after the association of that god with water, which is
prominent later but already present in the RV.</p>

<p>Unaccented mādhvī is of course a dual voc. addressed to the Aśvins, but
given its proximity to fem. nom. sg. rātíḥ ‘gift’, it seems possible that it was meant to
evoke also an accented mā́dhvī modifying this word. (However, Re points out that
the fem. of mádhu- is generally identical to the masc. in the RV.)</p>

<h3 id="i1852">I.185.2</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., I consider the embryo here to be the sun, but
various other identifications have been proposed.</p>
<h3 id="i1853">I.185.3</h3>
<p>The them. adj. anarvá- is clearly derived from the well-attested bahuvrīhi -
n-stem anarván- (cf. also the thematized anarváṇa-). The neut. NA to the n-stem
should be *anarvá, which is not found. In two instances in which it should modify a
neut. acc. (I.37.1, VI.48.15) we find instead the masc. anarvā́ṇam, an adjustment
probably meant to make the form more transparent (see comm. on those two
passages). As for the supposed them. stem anarvá-, in two of the occurrences listed
by Gr. the referents are neut. (cakrám I.164.2, dātrám here). In both passages the
neut. NA anarvám comes at the end of an odd pāda before an even pāda beginning
with a consonant. I think it is at least arguable that the original reading in both cases
was *anarvá, the expected neut. to the n-stem, which was redactionally altered to a
thematic acc. The alternation has no metrical consequences. As for the other two
forms that Gr lists to the them. stem, both (II.40.6, VII.40.4) qualify Aditi in the nom.
sg. and have the form anarvā́. I suggest that both actually belong to the n-stem,
whose nom. sg. has exactly that form, and that they are fem., but do not exhibit the
fem. derivational suffix -ī (expect *anarváṇī-?).</p>
<h3 id="i1854">I.185.4</h3>
<p>The lexeme ánu √as is fairly uncommon, but Agastya uses it twice
elsewhere (I.167.10, I.182.8); the rather more common ánu √bhū can mean ‘be
devoted to’ (&lt; ‘follow’), and that seems to be the sense here.
Most interpr. take átapyamāne as ‘free from suffering’, but the more literal
meaning of √tap ‘be hot, scorch’ seems appropriate in the solar context I see here.
In “the pair among the gods” (ubhé devā́nām), referring to Heaven and Earth,
ubhé ‘pair’ is dual, while in “along with the pairs among the days” (ubháyebhir
áhnām) ‘pairs’ (ubháyebhiḥ) is plural. This is presumably because Heaven and Earth
are a unique pair, whereas the two day-halves, Day and Night, are recurrent and can
be thought of as multiple pairs &ndash; though the dual can also be used of them, as in
áhanī in 1d.</p>
<h3 id="i1859">I.185.9</h3>
<p>Ge (/WG) take ūtī́as dual nom. (WG “beide Hilfen”), but Ge allows the
possibility of an instr. and Re takes it as instr., as do I. I think it likely that Heaven
and Earth have resurfaced here, in anticipation of their appearance in vss. 10–11, and
they are the subj. of sacetām.</p>
<h3 id="i186-1">I.186</h3>
<p>All Gods
As noted in the publ. intro., the hymn is knit together by a shifting pattern of
repeated initial preverbs and particles: 1a / 2a ā́(with ápi 1c), úpa 4a, which morphs
into utá 5a, 6a, 7a, 8a &ndash; the last 3 with utá na īm &ndash; followed by prá 9a, 9b, 10a, 10b
(which was anticipated by pṛ́&hellip; 8c. For the prá-s note 9a prá nú, 9b prá yu(&hellip;), 10
prá ū, 10b pra pū(&hellip;). Vs. 11 falls outside the picture. The repeated utá-s of vss. 5–8
reinforce the frequent additive quality of Viśve Devāḥ hymns.
I.186.1–3: The c-pādas of all three verses consist of a yáthā purpose clause with
subjunctive.</p>
<h3 id="i1861">I.186.1</h3>
<p>This vs. signals the dedicands of the hymn obliquely: viśvā́naraḥ ‘belonging
to all men’ in b evokes its opposite number “all gods,” esp. since the sg. deváḥ occurs
later in the same pāda. ‘All’ appears again in d, but with a different referent, ‘world’
(víśvaṃ jágat ‘the whole moving world’). The gods are presumably the addressees of
pāda c, but only under the designation ‘youths’ (yuvānaḥ).
The initial ápi of c is somewhat puzzling. Ge (/WG) render it ‘auch’, which is
harmless. Re takes it “au sense de abhí” (on what grounds?), as a perfectivizing
preverb (again, on what grounds?). I am inclined to take it as a locational ‘nearby’,
construed loosely with naḥ, despite the distance between the two words.
In d manīṣā́can be nom. or instr. I follow Ge in taking it as the former, while
Re and WG take it as the latter, with Re taking Savitar as implied subject and WG
víśvaṃ jágat. There is general agreement that a verb ‘come’ should be supplied in d.</p>
<h3 id="i1863">I.186.3</h3>
<p>On pāda c see Thieme, Fremdling, 36–37, and his revised interpr., Mitra and
Aryaman, 66, which I follow here. Ge’s “dessen Name in Ehren steht” (sim. Thieme
[Fremdling], Klein [DGRV I.228], WG) for sukīrtí- cannot be correct, because
sukīrtí- is otherwise a noun.</p>
<h3 id="i1864">I.186.4</h3>
<p>The standard tr. make rather heavy weather of pāda b, where the simile
sudúgheva dhenúḥ is nominative, but uṣā́sānáktā, the most likely comparandum,
makes most sense as the acc. goal of éṣe in pāda a. (Note in passing that HvN’s
accentless eṣe is simply wrong.) The simile “like an easily milked cow” should not
apply to the 1st ps. subj. of that verb. To deal with the apparent case mismatch (and to
avoid the specious explanation “nominative for accusative in simile”), most interpr.
take b as a parenthetical nominal sentence (e.g., Ge “&ndash; Nacht und Morgen sind wie
eine gutmelke Kuh &ndash;”; so also Re, Janert [Dhāsi, 29], Narten [Yasna H., 122], WG).
But this seems unnecessary: this is a repeated pāda, found also in VII.2.6, where the
dual uṣā́sānáktā is nominative. Since that form is ambiguous, it can be adapted here
to an accusative environment, without bothering to adjust the case of the simile. So
Bloomfield (ad I.186.4, anticipated by Old).

<h3 id="i1865">I.186.5</h3>
<p>The standard tr. (Ge, Re, WG) take the root aor. injunc. kaḥ as modal (e.g.,
Ge “soll … bereiten”); Hoffmann doesn’t treat this passage. Although I do not think
that kaḥ regularly shows such value, formulaic considerations suggest it does here:
the phrase máyas √kṛ occurs at the end of a Jagatī pāda as máyas karat (subjunctive:
I.89.3, V.46.4, VIII.18.7, X.64.1), once máyas kṛdhi (impv.: I.114.2). Truncating it to
fit a Triṣṭubh cadence here would yield monosyllabic kaḥ, which may maintain
modal value because of its association with the true modals in Jagatī cadences.</p>
<h3 id="i1866">I.186.6</h3>
<p>The end of b, abhipitvé sajóṣāḥ, is a sort of mash-up of 1d and 2b, and ā́
gantu echoes ā́… gamantu of 2a.</p>
<h3 id="i1867">I.186.7</h3>
<p>The cmpd. áśva-yoga-, bahuvrīhi by accent, is somewhat peculiar; it might
be closest to the type vájra-bāhu- ‘having an arm that has a mace (in it)’, hence
‘having a yoke that has horses (attached to it)’?</p>
<h3 id="i1868">I.186.8</h3>
<p>I take -senā- here and in 9d as ‘weapon’, not ‘army’ (contra the standard
interp.), because I think ‘weapon’ works better in 9d with the simile in 9c. However,
‘army’ (that is, warrior band vel sim.) is certainly not excluded.
Given the sequence vṛddhásenāḥ … pṛ́ṣadaśvāso ‘vánayo ná ráthāḥ, opening
with two bahuvrīhis, the last term avánayo ná ráthāḥ looks very like a decomposed
bahuvrīhi *aváni-ratha- ‘having chariots (like) streams’. Curiously, though Re is
usually quick to suggest such an interpr., he does not mention such a possibility in
his notes.</p>

<p>This vs. is classified as Anuṣṭubgarbhā (5 8 / 8 8), the only such vs. in the
RV. The first 5 syllables (pitúṃ nú stoṣam “Now I shall praise food”) are almost like
a heading or title; without that pāda the vs. would be a straight Gāyatrī like the
following one (and also vss. 4, 8–10), though it would lack a verb to govern the acc.
in b.
The suffix-accented masc. dharmán- is rare and confined to the late RV, as
opposed to the common neut. dhárman-. Here ‘supporter, upholder’ would be a more
accurate tr. than ‘support’.
I take víparva- here as proleptic: the result of Trita’s shaking of Vṛtra is that
his joints go apart. Gr takes the ví- instead as privative (‘gelenklos’), which could
make sense for a snake. But the passages adduced by Ge, like VIII.6.13 ví vr̥trám
parvaśó ruján “breaking V. apart joint by joint,” demonstrate that Vṛtra is conceived
of as having joints, which can be parted.</p>

<p>dádhat is grammatically ambiguous. With most tr. I take it as a masc. nom.

the same stem (so Old [SBE]). There are no implications either way.
I.188.6–7, 9: These three vss. all contain hí in their first clause, which I render as
causal, contra the standard tr.</p>
<h3 id="i1889">I.188.9</h3>
<p>The double acc. rūpā́ṇi … paśū́n víśvān poses some difficulties. Ge
construes rūpā́ṇi with prabhúḥ (“der die Formen bemeistert”). But I know of no
other passages in which prabhú- governs an acc., and prabhvī́ḥ in 5a would
discourage such an interpr. in any case. X.110, the Āprī hymn most like this one, has
in the corresponding vs. rūpaír ápiṃśad bhúvanāni víśvā, with an instr. of rūpá-. In
both cases I think the rūpá- further specifies the primary object, in this case “all the
beasts”: it is their forms he is anointing.
The logical sequence in this vs. is broken in Ge’s tr. because of his use of
abstract vocab. for concrete notions: “hat … fertiggemacht” for samānajé ‘anointed’
and “Gedeihen” for sphātím ‘fat’. Surely the point is that the addressee of c
(probably Agni or the Hotar, with Ge) is urged to win the fat that Tvaṣṭar used to
anoint the beasts &ndash; however conceptually transformed such fat may be.</p>

<p>“of the gods” in the publ. tr. would be better rendered “for the gods.”</p>
<h3 id="i18811">I.188.11</h3>
<p>As in vs. 9, symbolic anointing, here by means of a chant or song, is still
represented as physical: Agni “shines” because of it, presumably gleaming from the
conceptual fat. I take gāyatréṇa as referring specifically to the Gāyatrī meter (in
which this hymn is composed), though it may merely be ‘song’, as Ge (/WG) take it.</p>

<p>Agni</p>
<h3 id="i1891">I.189.1</h3>
<p>The dat. rāyé with √nī may go too easily into English as a goal, “lead to
wealth”; ‘for wealth’ might be more faithful to the case form. However, I do not
subscribe to WG’s interpr. of supáthā as a neut. pl. goal (“zu den Orten, wo gute
Wege sind”), which seems awk. and unnec. when an instr. sg. works well and is
paralleled elsewhere.
(víśvāni) vayúnāni vidvā́n is a standard phrase, used esp. of Agni (I.72.7,
III.5.6, VI.15.10, X.122.2), referring presumably to his deep knowledge of the ritual
as the god most enmeshed in ritual.
I take juhurāṇá- to √hvṛ / hru ‘go crookedly, go astray’ (with Ge and Re, as
well as Gr), rather than with √hṛ ‘be angry’ with Insler (JAOS 88, 1968), apparently
followed by WG (“den zürnenden Frevel”). The contrast between the easy path in
pāda a and the énas- that goes crookedly/astray in c supports this ascription, as does
abhihrút- in 6d. Agastya uses the same participle in I.173.11, where its affinity to
√hvṛ rather than √hṛ is even clearer.</p>
<h3 id="i1892">I.189.2</h3>
<p>Pāda c provides a fine parallel to “A mighty fortress is our god.” The word
order is somewhat unusual, in that we might expect naḥ to take Wackernagel’s
position in the pāda as a whole; instead it seems to have taken up a version of that
position in the post-caesura phrase bahulā́na urvī́, which simply modifies the nom.
sg. pū́ḥ that begins the pāda. There might be several reasons for this. For one thing ca
occupies that position, but this is not a particularly compelling suggestion because
the function and positioning of that ca are somewhat puzzling. Klein (DGRV I.220 n.
81) suggests that it connects pū́ḥ … bhávā with the clause earlier in the vs. whose
verb is pārayā. I would suggest rather that it is an inverse ca conjoining the two
predicate nominatives construed with bhávā, i.e., pū́ḥ and śáṃ yóḥ. (This would,
among other things, eliminate another ex. of supposed sentential or clausal ca,
ascribing to it its more usual role as conjoiner of nominals.) It may also be that the
alliteration in the phrase pū́ḥ … pṛthvī́would stand out more starkly without naḥ in
between, but that should apply to ca as well.</p>
<h3 id="i1893">I.189.3</h3>
<p>The verb in b, abhy ámanta, is accented; though there is no overt
subordinator, I take pāda b as a purpose clause dependent on pāda a. That the obj. of
yuyodhi in a, ámīvā(ḥ) ‘afflictions’, forms an etymological figure with the verb in b
supports a close relationship between the pādas. ámanta is best taken as a subjunctive,
to the seṭ root pres. amīti and as an -anta replacement for act. *-an of the usual type
in this otherwise act. verbal system (Jamison IIJ 21 [1979] 150). This avoids
imposing an interpr. as a reciprocal middle, as noted as an alternative by WG with
ref. to Hoffmann and Dunkel, although the WG tr. does not reflect it.
The 2nd hemistich lacks a verb. I supply kaḥ; the idiom púnar √kṛ ‘make new,
renew’ is fairly common (see Gr., s.v. púnar, 2), and see also Agastya’s I.174.7 kṣā́m
… kaḥ, with the same object as here though with a very different sense. The publ. tr.
should signal the lack of verb by a device like “Re(new) …” or “(Make) new …”</p>
<h3 id="i1894">I.189.4</h3>
<p>It is not clear what (if anything) utá is conjoining. Klein (DGRV I.371) says
there’s an ellipsis of the verb in the 2nd clause, but he doesn&rsquo;t say what verb. I am
reluctant to add semantics to utá of the type ‘even’, ‘also’, ‘especially’, as Re and Ge
do in their different ways. In the publ. tr. the pf. part. śuśukvā́n is translated (“and
when you blaze …”) as if it contrasted with an unexpressed different activity of
Agni’s. I might now be inclined to take it as an implicitly subordinated circumstantial
clause to be construed with the prohibitives of cd: “and when you blaze …, let not …”
However, the tr. “when you …” obscures the fact that the verbal notion is expressed
by a nom. sg. participle, which should (and does not) modify the subject of the mā́
clause(s) in cd. However, note that Agni is the subj. of the mā́clauses that occupy all
of vs. 5.</p>
<h3 id="i1897">I.189.7</h3>
<p>The ví with vidvā́n picks up the ví that both opens and closes the preceding
verse (ví … yaṃsat / viṣpáṭ), linking this verse to the apparently different topic that
precedes it. This provides a clue for the referent of tā́n … ubháyān “those both.” Ge
(/WG) take the both to refer to the two time periods mentioned in this verse, prapitvé
and abhipitvé, but, on the basis of the larger context, with Old (SBE) and Re I think it
refers to good and bad men, or more narrowly to sacificers and non-sacrificers.
Agni’s eagerness for the sacrifice is expressed by pāda b, where he pursues (véṣi) the
sons of Manu, i.e., the sacrificers, at the earlier mealtime, and his satisfaction as the
sacrifice proceeds by the gerundive śā́syaḥ ‘to be directed/instructed, tractable’.
In b Ge (/WG) supply ‘nourishment’ (die Nahrung) as object of véṣi with
mánuṣaḥ as gen. sg., but this seems unnecessary.
There is no consensus about the meaning or etymology of the word akrá- (5x),
generally a descriptor of Agni; see EWA s.v. Gr glosses ‘Herrzeichen, Banner’, but
since it is once called navajā́- ‘new-born’ (IV.6.3), an animal (or at least a living
thing) is more likely. Since several of the contexts refer to the kindling of the fire, it
seems likely to be a young animal, an identification that navajā́- of course favors.
And marmṛjénya- ‘to be groomed’ in our passage suggests a horse, since the root
√mṛj generally takes a horse or something so conceived as its object. Hence the tr.
‘foal’.
Despite the position of ná, uśígbhiḥ is unlikely to form part of the simile.</p>

<p>Bṛhaspati
For the hymn as a whole, see H.-P. Schmidt, Bṛhaspati und Indra (1968), 72–

<h3 id="i1901">I.190.1</h3>
<p>The main cl. verb vardhayā is entirely ambiguous between 2nd sg. imperative
and 1st sg. subjunctive. With Re and Schmidt (B+I) I opt for the 1st sg. subj., while Gr,
Ge, and WG take it as 2nd sg. impv. There are no implications either way.</p>
<h3 id="i1904">I.190.4</h3>
<p>There are a number of syntactic questions and problems in this verse. To
begin with, in pāda a the sequence divī́yate could be resolved as either diví īyate (so
Gr, Pp.) or diví ī́yate. In the latter case, with accented verb, we could have a
subordination without an overt subordinator. I have chosen to interpret it so, contra
the standard tr. and interpr. (though with Scar 371 n. 516), because the other likely
connections between pādas a and b favor this closer nexus.
The next questions arise because of the opening of pāda b, átyo ná yaṃsat.
The simile goes semantically most naturally with the preceding pāda, “like a steed, it
speeds …,” but the lack of accent on yaṃsat makes that impossible because this verb
would then be initial in its clause. The situation is complicated by the fact that yaṃsat
exactly replicates yaṃsat in 3b, where it governs ślókam in the accusative, whereas
here a nominative ślókaḥ is subject of the preceding pāda and in order to get it to be
object of yaṃsat here, the subject has to change and an unexpressed acc. *ślókam be
supplied. Moreover, the steed in the opening of b is a very likely object of yaṃsat,
but is in the wrong case. There are several (ad hoc) ways to handle this problem. The
first is simply to interpret the text as given, with the steed compared to the subject of
yaṃsat, who is probably Bṛhaspati. This is in fact the interpr. of the standard tr.,
though each one needs to supply material and adjust interpr. in order to make it work
semantically. I do not find these various makeshifts satisfactory. In order to confront
the semantic problems noted above, it is possible to assume that the verb in 4b was
originally really accented *yámṣat, which lost its accent redactionally because of
yaṃsat in the preceding verse. This would allow the tr. “When his signal-call speeds
in heaven and on earth like a steed, he will control it [=signal call/steed],” with the
simile taken with pāda a and a new clause beginning with *yáṃsat. This may be the
simplest solution, though it is not exactly the one in the publ. tr. Instead there I (more
or less) follow the suggestion sketched out by Old and discussed in more detail by
Scar (371 and n. 516), whereby átyo ná stands for *átyaṃ ná; Old explains the nom.
as attraction to the preceding pāda. Scar seems to endorse Old’s attraction hypothesis,
but his tr. is more complex (and essentially identical to mine), in that he reads the
simile both as nom. with pāda a and (in brackets) as acc. with pāda b. Although this
may seem over-fussy, it addresses both the syntactic and the semantic problems.
The second hemistich presents a more conventional type of double reading,
whereby the word hetáyaḥ is taken to belong both to the simile and to the frame,
which its position in the pāda facilitates. In the frame hetí- has its common meaning
‘missile, lance’, a development from the general ‘impel’ meaning of √hi; there is a
further metaphorical development here: the missiles of Bṛhaspati are his words. In
the simile, with the gen. mṛgā́ṇām, the hetí- are the charges or drives of the wild
beasts, using a more abstract or etymological sense of the -tí-stem. This double
interpr. is found in Old, Re, and Scar; it seems significantly more satisfying that Ge’s
notion (fld by WG) that takes mṛgā́ṇām as a datival gen. &ndash; the missiles/weapons for
the wild beasts &ndash; which requires that the two genitives mṛgā́ṇām and bṛ́haspáteḥ be
non-parallel.
With Scar I take the ca in c as coordinating cd with a.
I do not understand exactly what yakṣa-bhṛ́t- in b refers to, nor do I
understand why the heavens are áhimāya-. For the latter, one can recall that in
V.40.6, 8 the māyā́ḥ of Svarbhānu hide the sun and that in my extensive treatment of
the Svarbhānu myth (Ravenous Hyenas, 1991) I interpret those māyā́ḥ as the swirling
clouds of smoke issuing from Agni. So here the “serpentine wiles” that the heavens
possess might be the clouds of smoke from the ritual fire produced at the same time
as Bṛhaspati’s ritual signal call (though áhimāya- when applied to the gods would
have to have a different sense). This further suggests that the wondrous apparitions
(yakṣá-) that Bṛhaspati brings are other marvelous sights associated with the
sacrificial performance. But these are just guesses.</p>
<h3 id="i1905">I.190.5</h3>
<p>The standard tr. take pajrā́ḥ as a PN, as it can be elsewhere, but there seems
no reason to drag in Kakṣīvant’s kin for vilification, and I prefer taking it as a simple
descriptor.
The hapax usriká- is a nice example of a -ka-suffixed form in slangy and
deprecatory context. See my article on -ka- (IIJ 52, 2009).
There is disharmony in number between the two hemistichs: the relative cl. in
the plural describing the evil rivals is picked up by dat. singular dūḍhyè.
The accent on cáyase is probably due to the following íd, which does
condition verbal accent &ndash; though in fewer passages than listed by Gr (s.v. íd 5), since
many of his exx. are pāda-initial. It can also be noted here that the verb immediately
follows a pāda-initial voc. and is contrastive with ánu dadāsi in c, either of which
would also favor verbal accent.</p>
<h3 id="i1906">I.190.6</h3>
<p>In b the point is presumably that an ally who is constantly solicited by
everyone around is likely to change sides without warning.
With Old, Re, and Schmidt (B+I) I supply ‘cows’ with ápīvṛtā(ḥ), while Ge
(/WG) opt for ‘doors’. Since they all take the Aṅgirases as the implied subject, both
interpr. refer to the Vala myth.</p>
<h3 id="i1907">I.190.7</h3>
<p>The bahuvrīhi ródha-cakra-, lit. ‘having their banks as wheels’, may seem
slightly jarring, and Ge (/WG) attenuate the sense to “die die Ufer entlang rollen.”
But cakrá- is definitely the noun ‘wheel’ (all the way back into PIE), not a
transparent derivative of a verbal root meaning ‘roll’, and I think the cmpd must be
taken in its literal sense. (So also Re: “ayant pour roues les hautes-rives.”) The point
of comparison must be not the speed or movement of the chariot but its physical
configuration, with the wheels defining the outer limits of the vehicle as seen from
above or behind and rising above the bottom of its body, just as river banks do the
river.
A different watery image is found in the 2nd hemistich. With Ge I take táraḥ
here as a ford (like the etymologically related tīrthá-, both to √tṝ ‘cross, pass,’ etc.)
or perhaps more generally a means of crossing (water). Bṛhaspati, likened to a bird
of prey, keeps his eye on both the ford and the (deeper) waters &ndash; presumably
watching for fish to swim into the shallow water of the ford, so they can be snatched
close to the surface. This image is highly reminiscent of the feeding behavior of
water birds like cranes, egrets, and herons, whose preternatural stillness and singleminded vigilance as they stand in shallow water waiting for prey, followed by a swift
but graceful lunge with their beaks, can only impress the observer and could well
provide a model for the “knowing Bṛhaspati” and his sharp eyes depicted here. (For
those who haven’t had the pleasure of seeing this in the wild, there are numerous
YouTube videos.) Such birds are found in the appropriate geographical areas of NW
India/Pakistan, and since gṛ́dhra- lit. means ‘greedy’, it need not specifically
designate a vulture, pace Ge (/WG), Schmidt (‘Geier’), and Re (‘vautour’).
ā́paḥ here must be acc. pl., one of the handful of examples of the spread of the
nom. pl. to acc. function in this stem.</p>
<h3 id="i1908">I.190.8</h3>
<p>The standard tr. take deváḥ as a predicate nominative (vel sim.) with dhāyi
(e.g., Re “… a été installé (comme) dieu”). This may be correct, but it does assume
that Bṛhaspati only secondarily came to be considered as, or was made into, a deva
(so, e.g., Ge n. 2d). Following H.-P. Schmidt’s hypothesis that bṛ́haspáti- was
originally an epithet of, and aspect of, Indra, it would be possible to interpret this
passage as referring to the moment when Bṛhaspati emerged as a deva in his own
right; on the other hand, since Indra is most definitely a deva from the beginning, a
particular aspect of him should not require promotion to deva-status. It should be
noted that Schmidt explicitly disputes the standard interp. (B+I, 75–77) and tr. deváḥ
as a simple descriptor: “So wird der grosse, machtgeborene, mächtige B., der Stier,
der Gott eingesetzt.” I follow Schmidt.</p>
<h3 id="i191">I.191</h3>
<p>Against poisonous animals
Because of the popular character of this hymn and the idiomatic specificity of
the entities mentioned, much of the vocabulary is obscure. I will not discuss the
supposed real-world identifications or etymological speculations for each lexical
item. Reasonably up-to-date treatments of the sec. lit. are available in EWA, s.vv.</p>
<h3 id="i1911">I.191.1</h3>
<p>I do not understand the double íti of pāda c. But I assume that the “two” in
this pāda refers to the two differently identified káṅkata- in ab, the one that is not
(really) a káṅkata and the one that is a true (satīna-) káṅkata-. These are then reidentified as plúṣi-.
For the accent of adṛ́ṣta- see AiG II.1.226 and Nachtr. p. 66.</p>
<h3 id="i1912">I.191.2</h3>
<p>The feminine nemesis is not identified. As Ge notes (n. 2), Sāy. suggests it’s
the healing plant, Henry both the plant and dawn.</p>
<h3 id="i1913">I.191.3</h3>
<p>I take kúśara- as containing the pejorative ku-prefix (as in kú-yava-
‘(bringing) bad harvest’) and a play on the preceding word śará-.
The three vṛddhi derivatives, sairyá-, mauñjá-, and vairiṇá-, I interpret flg.
Sāy.’s suggestion for the last two, namely that they refer to the adṛ́ṣta- bugs found on
those particular grasses. Many of the most annoying biting insects lurk in tall grass
waiting for their victims to present unshielded ankles and calves &ndash; in the US
chiggers, fleas, and ticks come to mind.</p>
<h3 id="i1914">I.191.4</h3>
<p>This vs. seems an attempt at sympathetic magic: animals, both domestic and
wild, and humans (symbolized by their lights, presumably their fires) are all settling
down for the night (though the time period is not explicit), and so should the bugs.
As anyone who’s ever been outside in a buggy place after dark knows, this magic is
not necessarily going to work &ndash; though it’s true that some types of bugs are active at
dusk and then stop.</p>
<h3 id="i1915">I.191.5</h3>
<p>This vs. does seem to refer to such insects, those that become active at
twilight when the wind drops. For example, although there are numerous types of
mosquitoes and different species have different feeding patterns, it seems (from a
quick Google search) that most species feed at dawn and dusk and a few hours into
the dark.</p>
<h3 id="i1916">I.191.6</h3>
<p>It is unclear to me why the bugs are being credited with such a grand
pedigree. Perhaps to indicate that they are ubiquitous in the space between earth and
heaven?
Sāy. suggests this vs. and the next are addressed to snakes, but there seems no
reason why adṛ́ṣta- would change its referent. As I noted in the publ. intro., the
impulse to demand that a troublesome unswattable bug settle down long enough to be
squashed is likely to be universal.
I.191.8–9: The rising of the sun may reflect the fact, mentioned above, that many
bugs feed at twilight (dawn and dusk), and sunrise portends the end of the (pre-)dawn
feeding frenzy.</p>
<h3 id="i19110">I.191.10</h3>
<p>As noted in the publ. intro., the second part of the hymn begins here, but it
clearly pivots on the sun, which figured in the two preceding vss.
My interpr. of this much discussed vs. is presented in the publ. intro., but in
compressed fashion. As noted there, I think this has to do with the separation of
noxious liquid from beneficial liquid, a feat ascribed in natural terms to the sun and
in mythological terms to Indra. When “I fasten the poison on the sun” (pāda a), I am
counting on the purificatory power of the sun to neutralize or banish the poison. This
ritualistic action is matched in pāda b by fastening the skin onto the house of the
surā-possessor. Surā is an alcoholic beverage of some sort (generally tr.
‘Branntwein’, ‘brandy’, et sim., though, acdg. to James McHugh [p.c.], it is unlikely
that the technology of distilling was known to Vedic India, so probably some sort of
beer; see now McHugh forthcoming [JAOS], “The Ancient Indian Alcoholic Drink
Called Surā: Vedic Evidence”) and a universally condemned evil twin to soma,
though it gets used in some śrauta rituals, particularly the Sautrāmaṇī. The
appearance of the surā-possessor (súrāvant-) in b is owing to two factors: on the one
hand, as just noted, surā is a taboo drink and is therefore equivalent to the poison
(viṣá-) in pāda a. On the other, the word súrā- is phonologically reminiscent of ‘sun’
sū́rya- in pāda a.
The natural/ritual action depicted in the first pāda is, in my interpr., matched
by the mythological action of the second pāda. I therefore do not take pāda b as a
simile (as Ge does), but as a parallel action &ndash; the attachment of a skin (dṛ́ti-) full of
poison/surā on the house of the surā-possessor, who, in my view, is Indra, who
appears by epithet in pāda e. (Though Ge and others tentatively identify hariṣṭhā́- as
the sun god, the ‘mounter of the fallow bays’ can only be Indra.) Later Vedic has a
cmpd. surā-dṛti- ‘surā-skin’, found in PB XIV.11.26 and JB III.229. Both passages
concern the vipānam of a liquid; vi √pā, lit. ‘drink apart’, is used for the separation
of two kinds of liquids that have been mixed together (or separation of a liquid from
something containing it); see comm. ad VII.22.4. In the late RV and later, this
lexeme is specialized for the Sautrāmaṇī ritual, whose mythological foundation is the
healing of Indra by the Aśvins and Sarasvatī, after he had drunk too much soma.
They make him drink surā, which was mixed with soma (perhaps the soma he had
already drunk), and he performs the feat of separating the two liquids. This myth is
already present in X.131.4–5 with precisely this detail. When in pāda b here we
fashion the skin of poison onto Indra the surā-drinker’s house, we are implicitly
asking him to perform the same feat for us. The refrain (found in vss. 10–13, pādas
c-f) makes it clear that he has succeeded. At least in my interpr., it is said that Indra
has put the poison far in the distance (e) and the honeyed (plant?) has made honey
(quite possibly soma, as often)(f): the two liquids have been separated and are
separate, with the good one available to us. The result is that the mythological model,
Indra, will not die (c) &ndash; nor will we (d) &ndash; and the poison with which we began has
been rendered ineffective.</p>
<h3 id="i19111">I.191.11</h3>
<p>The extraordinary density of -ka-suffixed forms begins here and lasts till
the end of the hymn. That little birds eat the poison and destroy it may reflect the fact
that many birds eat noxious insects without harm to them and with benefit to us. But
the insects may no longer be the subject of this part of the hymn.</p>
<h3 id="i19112">I.191.12</h3>
<p>Sāy. suggests that the “little sparks” (viṣpuliṅgaká-) are little sparrows.
This makes sense not only because of the birds in vss. 11 and 14, but because of the
visual effect of flocks of small birds feeding: esp. when they are in bushes or
underbrush they can burst up, out, and around at random almost like sparks. The viṣor course also recalls viṣá- ‘poison’. I do not understand why there are 21 of them,
save for the fact that thrice seven is a satisfying number. Similar numbers are found
in the next two vss.</p>
<h3 id="i19113">I.191.13</h3>
<p>The “tormentors” (/harmers, destroyers) of poison, the hapax gen. pl.
rópuṣīṇām, are feminine. The referent is entirely unclear, but the removers of poison
in the next vs. are all feminine as well.
I.191.15–16: The -ka- suffix is particularly prominent in these vss, appearing not
only on the designation of the bug (kuṣumbhakáḥ, 2x), but also on the pronominal adj.
iyattakáḥ (‘such a one’), the pronoun takám, and the participle pravartamānakáḥ.
The word for ‘scorpion’, vṛ́ścika- only appears in that form, but appears to contain
the -ka- suffix as well, very common in words for noxious insects (see my “-kasuffix,” IIJ 52 [2009]: 318).</p>
