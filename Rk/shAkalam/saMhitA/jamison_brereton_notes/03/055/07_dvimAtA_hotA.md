Pāda b is a elaboration on and corrective of 6b. It is not the whole fire that wanders untethered, only the top of it (ágram), while the base stays put on the hearth.

Most tr. take ágram as an acc. with ánu; I follow Re (who in turn follows Bergaigne) in taking it as the neut. nom. subj.

The accent on cárati is contrastive with the immediately following kṣéti, which opens a new clause.
