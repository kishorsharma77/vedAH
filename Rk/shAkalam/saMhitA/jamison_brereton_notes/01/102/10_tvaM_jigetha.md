In b the singular loc. ājā́appears to be modified by two loc. plurals árbheṣu and mahátsu (so Old, Ge, Re); cf. I.81.1 mahátsu ājíṣūtém árbhe with a different imbalance of number. WG take the plurals separate from the singular (“im Wettkampf um kleine (Dinge) und um grosse”) (see their note). This is possible but unnecessary.
