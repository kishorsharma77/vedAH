With Ge and Re, I take the simile uṣáso ná prátīkam as a nominative phrase, matching the subject Savitar. Since the dakṣiṇās are distributed at dawn and Dawn is therefore associated with munificence, her face (= her light) can be characterized as a discloser of valuables. However, it would also be grammatically possible to take it as acc., with Savitar disclosing valuables as if disclosing the face of Dawn, though I think this less likely.
