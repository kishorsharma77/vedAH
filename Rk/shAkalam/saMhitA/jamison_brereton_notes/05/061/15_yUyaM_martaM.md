Whose dhī́- is it? Ge, Re, and WG all assume it is the mortal’s (e.g., Ge “Ihr … führet den Sterblichen recht nach seinem Sinn”), but the placement of the phrase itthā́dhiyā́right after praṇetā́raḥ and at some distance from mártam at least weakly suggests that it is the Maruts’s. Since, as I have had occasion to remark many times, the Maruts sometimes have the role of verbal praisers and sometimes are the recipients of the same, I think both readings are possible and the poet may have wanted it to remain ambiguous. Tichy’s tr. (-tar-stems, 300-301) seems to attribute the dhī́- to the Maruts or at least remains neutral: “Ihr bringt den Menschen vorwärts … recht mit Bedacht.” Note that in the cmpd yāma-hūti- it is the Maruts’ journeys (yā́ma-, 1st member) but the mortal’s invocations (-hūti-, 2nd member).
