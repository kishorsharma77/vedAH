The latter part of this verse shows a nice phonological pattern, with the initial words in the pāda being c mahó, d máhi, f máhi, but g máthīr. The first three all belong of course to the mah (‘great’) family, but the last is a verb form whose apparent near match with the two preceding máhi belies its independent grammatical identity.

There is probably also a phonological impetus for the use of sácanas- instead of the much more common sajóṣas- in b: sácanās better matches sucetúnā.

In de most tr. (including me) take máhi … nas kṛdhi, saṃcákṣe … as an infinitive phrase, “make us regard (something) great.” Keydana (Infin. 342) allows this possibility, but also raises the possibility of an adjunct usage: “make something great for us, for seeing.” Although I recognize that the latter is not excluded, I think the infinitive reading is the more likely -- on the basis of the other dative phrase in e, bhujé asyaí. The final position of asyaí here is odd, and in fact the use of it at all is odd, given that an unadorned bhujé ends 8b and its tag-pāda 8c. I think that we have a demonstrative adj. with bhujé in this verse in order to anchor bhujé as a noun and to distinguish it from the immediately preceding dative, also built to a root noun, but in infinitival function. In other words, the asyaí serves to polarize the grammatical functions of two identically formed nominals.

In máthīḥ I see the same pun on the two roots √math as was found in 7c. Here the plundering sense is appropriate to the simile ugró ná śávasā “like a mighty (warrior) with vast power,” while the churn sense is attached to Agni as fire the substance. Although the ritual fire is churned (passively), we can imagine Agni using the same means that produced him (churning) to produce something for us. (So, more or less, Ge.) Narten (KlSch 24; followed apparently by WG) feels that máthīḥ here can only have the ‘rob’ sense, because only fire can be the obj. of the ‘churn’ sense, but this opinion displays, at least in my view, the often deficient poetic and imaginative sense of the Erlangen school.
