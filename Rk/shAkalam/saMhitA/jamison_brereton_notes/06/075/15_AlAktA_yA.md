The antelope head and metal mouth of the arrow are not entirely clear. I assume that this refers to a deer-antler arrowhead (as in 11a) with a further metal tip attached to it. The internet assures me that such things have been discovered, if rarely, in archaeological contexts. Ge (n. 15b) suggests either this or that the múkham is the ring that connects the shaft and the arrowhead. But as far as I can tell, in my exploration of the odd internet world of makers of primitive arrowheads, there would not be a separate metal ring or socket used to attach a bone/antler arrowhead to the shaft; when there’s a metal attachment, the whole arrowhead is metal.

In a hymn so attuned to the grammatical gender, and therefore of the metaphorical gender, of the key words, there is a special frisson in describing the feminine arrow (íṣu-) -- here in the dat. íṣvai, whose -v-ai stem+ending shows the specifically feminine inflection of short -u-stems -- with a cmpd that ends with - retas- ‘semen’. The accent of the cmpd parjánya-retas- shows that it must be a bahuvrīhi ‘having (or in this case, in my opinion, receiving) the semen of Thunder/Parjanya’; hence tr. like Re (Hymnes spéc) “semence de Parjanya,” Doniger “to this seed of Parjanya” are misleading and grammatically wrong. As to what this refers to in practical terms, Re may well be correct that the shaft of the arrow is made of reed, which grows in the rains and is associated with the thunderstorm.
