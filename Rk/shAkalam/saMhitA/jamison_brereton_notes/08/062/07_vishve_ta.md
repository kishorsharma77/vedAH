úd yád … gṛhám índraś ca gánvahi “when we two, (I) and Indra , go up to his house….” (Of course all those examples involve 1st ps. exclusive, rather than inclusive as here.) The increasing emphasis in this hymn on partnership between god and human discussed in the publ. intro. accounts for the explicit “both I and you” here.
