85 (797)  
Soma Pavamāna  
Vena Bhārgava  
12 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 11–12  
The last two hymns of the jagatī group, IX.85–86, break the standard pattern of  decreasing numbers of verses, having twelve and forty-eight verses respectively, after  a group of hymns with five verses (IX.75–84). However, each of these longer hymns  can be divided into a series of shorter ones, which then conform to the patterns of  hymn arrangement. In the case of IX.85, it consists of three groups of four verses  each. The entire assemblage is attributed to Vena Bhārgava, also the supposed poet of the enigmatic “Vena” hymn (X.123; see also a brief discussion under IX.83). As  we will see, there are certainly striking similarities between the last quartet of IX.85  (vss. 9–12) and X.123.  
The first quartet (vss. 1–4) begins with Soma the militant, keeping unworthy and  hostile forces at bay and aiding Indra in the same enterprise (vss. 1–2). His relation ship to Indra persists in verses 3–4, which show a more positive side of the militant  Soma: his status as king (vs. 3) and winner of space for us (vs. 4).  
The second section (vss. 5–8) is quite straightforward and focuses on the purifi cation of the soma, deploying the standard tropes.  
As noted the final four verses (9–12) strongly resemble the Vena hymn (X.123),  but they are considerably easier to decode. They concern heavenly Soma, who is  identified with the sun, but who also appears in a number of different guises: a bull,  a poet, and a king (all in vs. 9), an ox (vs. 10), an eagle, a child, and a bird (vs. 11),  and finally a Gandharva (vs. 12).
