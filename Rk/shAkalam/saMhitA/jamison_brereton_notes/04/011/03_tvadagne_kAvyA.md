The sense of the preceding vs., that Agni provides the very thoughts with which we create his praises, is continued in 3ab. In cd and vs. 4 the material rewards that come to the poet who produces these praises are detailed.

The phrase dráviṇaṃ vīrápeśā(ḥ) also appears, also pāda-final, at X.80.4, and therefore the apparent nom. sg. masc. vīrápeśāḥ must modify the neut. sg. dráviṇam.

This is a case like dvibárhas- (see comm. ad VII.24.2), where an s-stem ending in - āḥ at the end of the pāda must be interpr. as a neut. See AiG III.288.
