I take maghā́as object of both yātáyantam and dádatam; it is neatly positioned between the two participles. Ge renders ṛtuthā́yātáyantam as “dass du pünktlich vergilst” (repay, requite), but this is not a standard meaning of √yat. WG’s “dass du … die (verdiente) Stellung verschaffst” is closer to the sense of the root, but lacks the obj. one expects with an -áya-transitive. A locution very close to my interpr.

is found in IX.39.2 jánāya yātáyann íṣaḥ “arranging the refreshments for the people.” Contra Old, who assigns garhate to √grabh, I take it to √gṛh ‘complain’; see EWA s.v. GARH and esp. Hoffmann “Vedisch grh̥ 'klagen” (MSS 14 [1959]: 35-38 = Aufs. 439-41) cited there. There is likely a phonological play between this verb and jagṛbhre in the previous, twinned, verse.
