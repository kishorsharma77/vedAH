Ge takes c as a statement “Gewiss wirst du, Indra, es für uns doch möglich machen,” while I think it continues the questions of ab. The status of kuvíd clauses is somewhat murky, in that kuvíd is clearly built to an interrogative stem, but it also generally conditions accent on the verb (as here, śákaḥ) giving it also the appearance of a subordinator. See Delbrück (AiS 550-51), Hettrich (Hypotaxe, 142-55), Etter (Fragesätze, 219-30). An interpretation, like Etter’s, that kuvíd marks an implicit indirect question such as “is it not the case that…?” seeks to capture these two somewhat contradictory features of the particle’s syntax, though a full rendering of this in tr. is often too heavy (as it would be here). For further on kuvíd and verbal accentuation see comm. ad II.35.1.
