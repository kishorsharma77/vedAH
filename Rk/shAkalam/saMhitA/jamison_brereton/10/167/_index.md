Indra (1–2, 4), Assorted Divinities (3)
Viśvāmitra and Jamadagni
4 verses: jagatī
A fairly conventional invitation to the soma sacrifice. One of Indra’s great deeds,  the conquering of the sun, is alluded to (vss. 1–2), and already in verse 1 he is asked  for wealth. The final verse is spoken by Indra himself, who accepts both the soma  and the praise while recognizing that he is entitled to these offerings only if he  provides good things in return. One noteworthy feature is the poet-priest’s claim to  have himself consumed copious amounts of soma (vs. 4).
