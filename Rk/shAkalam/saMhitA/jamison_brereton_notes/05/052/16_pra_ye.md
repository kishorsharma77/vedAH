This Paṅkti vs. is the last real vs. of the hymn, since 17 (also Paṅkti) is a dānastuti. It begins with prá, just as vs. 1 did, and continues with the insistent repetion of the verb of speech vocanta (pādas b, c, e). The vs. is also reminiscent of repeated ohate ‘vaunt themselves’ in 10-11; as there, the recipient of the Maruts’ speech here is “me.” The structure of the vs. would be clearer if the tr. read “Those who proclaimed … they proclaimed P. their mother, then they proclaimed their father …” On iṣmín- see comm. ad I.87.6.
