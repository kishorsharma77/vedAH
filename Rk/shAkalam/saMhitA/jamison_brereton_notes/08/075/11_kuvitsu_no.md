The publ. tr. “…you will toil for wealth for us, for our quest for cattle” makes the two “for” phrases sound parallel, though they are not in Sanskrt (acc. rayím, dat. gáviṣṭaye). The intent is that Agni should work hard to obtain wealth for us, which we can use in our quest for cattle (that is, further wealth).

Pāda c is an almost comically economical etymological figure: úrukṛd urú naḥ kṛdhi.
