Indra (1–13), Dānastuti of R̥ksa and A ̣ ̄svamedha ́ (14–19)  
Priyamedha Āṅgirasa  
19 verses: gāyatrī, except anuṣṭubh 1, 4, 7, 10. Verses 1–12 arranged in trcas ̥  
This hymn falls into two parts. It begins with four tr̥cas (vss. 1–12) dedicated to  Indra, each beginning with an anuṣṭubh verse and continuing in gāyatrī; there fol lows a single appended verse (13) continuing the thought of the previous verse. The  final six verses are a dānastuti to a set of patrons whose names and identities are  not entirely easy to sort out.  
The Indra portion is conventional, with an emphasis on his extreme power and  might. The dānastuti is likewise comparatively straightforward compared to others  of this genre, with a catalogue of the gifts received and a promise to the patrons,  expressed in surprisingly negative terms, that even a man who wishes to insult them  will not be able to do so (vs. 19).
