Though apparently straightforward, this vs. is rather oddly constructed, esp.

pāda b. The conjoined NP pūṣṇáh … índrasya ca “of Pūṣan and Indra” is separated by some distance, though perfectly comprehensible. It is the material that separates it, pāda b vṛkṣásya prá vayā́m iva, that seems awkward. Particularly odd is the midpāda position of prá, which is far from its verb (if it has a verb; see below) and breaks up a simile with which is seems unconnected: vṛkṣásya … vayā́m iva “like the branch of a tree.” In the simile itself iva is wrongly placed (expect *vṛkṣasya-iva vayā́m). It is also doubtful that prá is in tmesis from the verb (ā́) rabhāmahe, since prá never otherwise occurs with √rabh, which is very common with ā́. I have no explanation for either the position or the function of prá. As for the wrong placement of iva, putting it after the 2nd term of the simile is not altogether rare and is therefore less puzzling.

All of this may have something to do with the poet’s attempt to set up the play vayám (a), vayā́m (b), though that play would have been more effective if vayā́m were pāda-final, not followed by iva.
