Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
22 verses: triṣṭubh
This long hymn follows a familiar path. It begins with three verses expressing the  sacrificers’ hopes that Indra will appear at their sacrifice and their worries about his  continuing absence. There follow a number of verses (4–14) describing the powers  and deeds of Indra, past and present, including the defeats of Vr̥tra (8) and Vala  (10). This section ends with two verses (12–13) on the sun and dawn, showing that  Indra orders the cosmos both spatially and temporally. The riddling verse 14, with  the well-known paradox of the “cooked” milk contained within a “raw” cow, ends  this section of the hymn by seeming to identify the dawn as cow with other images  of plenty for which Indra is responsible; it picks up the cow imagery already found  in verse 10 concerning the release of the cows from the Vala cave. Moreover, since  sacrificial gifts are distributed at the dawn ritual, the mention of dawn sets the stage  for the requests for gifts at the end of the hymn.
The next part of the hymn (15–17) begins abruptly with an address to Indra  and a command to him:  he is exhorted to come to the aid of the poet and his  allies against enemies in violent battle. The final section (18–21) continues the direct  requests to Indra, but here for material goods to be distributed peaceably at the sac
rifice. The final verse (before the refrain) applies the model of the Vala victory to the  present, beseeching Indra to continue to break open cowpens and distribute cows. As often, the concerns of the whole hymn are subtly foreshadowed in the first  verse, which both establishes the sacrificers as beset by hostile forces and their sac rifice as a site for beneficial exchange with the god.
The hymn is characterized by a number of hapaxes and by affective morphology,  especially in the sections devoted to Indra’s opponents; the translations of some of  these words are provisional.
