Soma Pavamāna  
Kavi Bhārgava  
5 verses: jagatī  
This portrait of Soma militant resembles the martial spirit of another of Kavi  Bhārgava’s hymns, IX.47. The dense series of combative images also track Soma’s  journey through the purificatory procedure, and his warlike power is to be har nessed for our own ends in the final verse (5). But Soma is not merely a warrior; he  is also a master of verbal art, who triumphs in poetic competitions (vs. 4). A short  but very satisfying poem.
