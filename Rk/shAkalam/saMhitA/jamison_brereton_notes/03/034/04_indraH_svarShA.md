The phonetic echo of uśádhag (3c) in uśígbhiḥ (4b) reinforces both the thematic connection between these two vss. -- Indra’s production of light -- and the superimposition of Agni traits on Indra. As Schmidt (B+I 59) points out, the Uśijpriests, ordinarily associated with Agni, sometimes substitute for the Aṅgirases in the Vala myth, but we should also note that it is esp. in Maṇḍala III that Agni is himself identified as an Uśij (III.2.4; 3.7,8; 11.2, 27.10); note also the Uśij-priests attending on him in III.2.9, 15.3.
