For vṛ́ṣṇi and the phrase vṛ́ṣṇi te śávaḥ see disc. ad VIII.96.19.

Thieme (KZ 92: 46) rejects the usual interpr. of kṣonī́ḥ as nom. sg., on the grounds that the nom. sg. is attested as kṣoṇī́in I.180.5 and that kṣoṇī́ḥ is otherwise nom. or acc. pl. However, this requires him to interpr. it as an acc. pl. of Inhalts or result with a passive verb: “dem (d.h.: wenn ihm) Gebrüll (aufrüttelndes Kampfgechrei) hinterhergeschreien worden ist.” The syntactic complications of this interpr. seem to me to outweigh the drawbacks of assuming that the poorly attested stem kṣoṇī́- could generate a nom. sg. in -ī́s, esp. since its suffixal accent matches that of vṛkī́-type nouns.
