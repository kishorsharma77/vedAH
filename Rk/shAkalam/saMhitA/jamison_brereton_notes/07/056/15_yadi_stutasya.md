The phonological figure of the two words adhīthá, itthā́straddling the pāda boundary of ab provide a nice little study in syllable weight. (The echo is of course obscured by the application of sandhi in the Saṃhitā text: adhīthéthā́). If we add in the opening of the vs., yádi, the echo is even more pronounced: yádi … adhīthá, itthā́, with (y)ádi doubling adhī.

Exactly what itthā́is doing here is unclear to me, but this adverb several times appears in context with vípra- and some verb of invoking (see Ge ad VII.94.5), as here (with the invoking represented by the nominal hávīman). Cf. VII.94.5 … īḷata, itthā́víprāsaḥ, IV.29.4 = VIII.7.30 itthā́vípraṃ hávamānam. I suggest that itthā́ refers to the precise manner in which a vípra- makes the invocation.

The Maruts are asked to “give study to / be mindful of” what is stutásya.

stutá- is of course a very common past passive participle meaning ‘(what/who is) praised’. In this context we might rather expect the abstract noun ‘praise’, and indeed Ge simply so tr.: “… des Lobpreises eingedenk seid,” with no explicit comment, but a crossref. (n. 15a) to several passages with a similar idiom but with stotrásya ‘praise song’ instead of stutásya (e.g., V.55.9 ádhi stótrasya … gātana). But the poet could easily have used stotrásya here in the same metrical slot if he had wanted to, and so I think we must take the ppl. seriously. Re in fact does so -- “prêtez-attention à la chose-louée” -- though in his n. he simply notes its similarity to the stotrá- passages.

I think the point is a cleverer one: the poet suggests that if the Maruts pay attention to what we poets praise -- what gifts we poets praise -- they will know what to bestow on us. The “if” clause is immediately followed by its corollary: “right away give (us) wealth …” -- the poet implying that the Maruts are a quick study! Although I must admit that stutá- ‘praised’ seems always to refer to gods, not to material objects, the semantic extension seems an easy one, and we can invoke the term dāna-stuti- ‘praise of the gift’ - though it’s notable that, although this term is ubiquitous in secondary lit. on the RV, it is not actually attested in Vedic.

By my rules, we might expect that anyáḥ in d should be definite (‘the other’) rather than the indefinite ‘another’ that better fits the passage (unless we assume that the anyáḥ is a rival poet). However, I suggest that nū́cid … anyáḥ is a composite negative indefinite expression like ná káś cid anyáh. Cf. VIII.24.11 nū́anyátrā cid … The cadence of d is bad. It is tempting to emend injunc. ādábhat to subj.

ādábhāt, which would fix the meter and fit the sense (in fact, the publ. tr. renders the verb as if a subj.: ‘will … swindle’), though no doubt the temptation should be resisted.
