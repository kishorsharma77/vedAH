As noted in the intro., this verse forms a ring with vss. 3-4: 3a/10a the buffalo at the waterhole, 4d/10d Indra’s assumption of power (… dadhiṣe sáhaḥ).

Pāda c with niméghamānaḥ ‘pissing down’ fits a Marut context better than an Indraic one, and the other occurrence of this form (II.34.13) does in fact refer to the Maruts and the rain they produce. See 5d above for another motif borrowed from a Marut context. In this passage the product is presumably metaphorically the gifts that Indra showers down.
