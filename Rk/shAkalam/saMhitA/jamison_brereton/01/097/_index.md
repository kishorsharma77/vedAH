Agni (or Agni śuci “Blazing Agni”)  
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
8 verses: gāyatrī  
Like the previous hymn, this one has a refrain, which is also not always syntacti cally integrated in the verse. But here the independence is more jarring because the  refrain is just a participial phrase, not a self-contained clause. The rest of this brief  hymn consists of snatches of expressed hopes for the well-being of the sacrificers  and the patrons and for Agni’s aid in overcoming hostilities. The Sanskrit contains  a pleasing counterpoint of preverbs, which cannot be easily rendered in English.
