Agni  
Trita Āptya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh  
After the enigmas of the preceding hymn, the relative simplicity of this one comes  as some relief. It begins with an annunciatory “here he is,” and the remainder of  the first three verses consists of relative clauses describing Agni. Relative clauses  also dominate verses 5–6. The contents are fairly standard: Agni’s radiance (esp.  vss. 1–2), his role in the sacrifice and his reciprocal relationship with the poet and  priest (vss. 3–5), and prayers for Agni’s intervention in bringing help and other  good things to us (vss. 6–7). These last two verses address Agni directly; in the first  five verses he appears only in the 3rd person. Unlike the last hymn, in which the  word agní appeared only in the last half-verse, this hymn contains a form of the  name in every verse.
