Most depictions of battle in the RV do not frame the risks of entering into battle quite so starkly. Here both ririkvā́ṃsas tanvàḥ “having given up their bodies” in b and tyāgám … ágman “have come to the abandonment (of their bodies, presumably)” in c seem to refer to a sort of resignation in the face of death and a loss of the sense of self. (Note that this is the only occurrence of tyā́ga- in the RV.) It is esp. telling that they give up their own bodies to gain offspring and a long line of descendants. For the similarity between this passage and the Tānūnaptra ritual, see Proferes (58).
