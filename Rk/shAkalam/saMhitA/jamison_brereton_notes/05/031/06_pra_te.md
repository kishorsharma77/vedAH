Though Gr refuses to tr., katpayám seems to contain the pejorative kaprefix; see EWA s.v. ká1 , p. 285.

For ápa √gṝ ‘taunt’ see comm. ad V.29.4. As Oberlies (Relig. I.401) points out, this gerund depicts a pre-battle boasting/insulting match -- trash talk (needless to say, this last is not Oberlies’s formulation).

What to do with uccaíḥ is unclear. Most take it with the gerund apagū́rya; so Ge “hoch ausholend,” with his interpr. of the gerund as belonging to a √gṝ ‘hold out’; with the assignment to ápa √gṝ ‘insult’, Schaeffer “nachdem er laut Schmähreden geführt hat”; Oberlies “nachdem er ihn [zuvor] mit lauter Stimme geschmäht hatte”; WG “indem er ihn von oben herab verspottete.” The Schaeffer / Oberlies interpr. of the adverb as ‘loud’ is appealing, but uccā́is always positional in the RV. The WG interpr. recognizes this fact, but insulting from above seems an odd activity. I take it rather with jaghāna. A fatal blow is more likely to come from above than a taunt, and it is notable how often in the hymn it is emphasized that Vṛtra was smashed down: 1d áva … han, 4d ní jaghāna, 5a níṣattam, 7d adhamám, 8d ní … āvṛnak. To depict Indra as correspondingly acting above provides the thematic complement. Note also úd … índraḥ … vádhar yámiṣṭa (“… held up …”) in the next hemistich, 7ab.
