Note the doubling of pres. sásti ‘sleeps’ with the adverbial gerund anuṣvā́pam. In Jamison 1982/83 I argue that the gerund is used here because the poet wanted to use a pres. tense of √svap but didn’t really know one, since the various presents to this root are secondary and to some extent improvisational.

The end of the verse … dhehi táṃ tátaḥ with its two final pronominals is striking, but clearly constructed as the mirror image of 2d tásminn táṃ dhehi. The good sacrificer of 2cd is contrasted with the godless, vowless man of 3, and it may not be entirely fanciful to suggest that the unusual word order — tá-forms ordinarily occurring at the beginning of clauses — is a syntactic expression of his perverse nature.
