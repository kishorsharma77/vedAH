Agni Vaiśvānara
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: triṣṭubh
In each of the three verses of this hymn, the poet calls Agni vaíśvānara (vss. 1d, 2d,  3c), thereby identifying the emerging ritual fire with the rising sun. Because Agni is  the sun, he blazes everywhere, smashes enemies, fills heaven and earth with his light,  releases the gods from the curse (of darkness), looks upon all beings, and encom
passes the earth. The poet brings to Agni his hymn as an offering in the hope that  with these powers Agni will bring success to the poet’s words.

## 1
Bring forth to Agni—blazing everywhere, granting insight, smashing  (enemy) lords—our thought, our vision.
Being pleased (with it), I bring it, like an offering on the ritual grass, to  Vaiśvānara for him to hold fast to our thoughts.
## 2
You, o Agni, blazing with your blaze, filled the two world-halves as you  were coming to birth.
You released the gods from the curse, o Vaiśvānara, Jātavedas, through  your greatness.
## 3
Since, o Agni, when just born, you surveyed living beings like a herdsman  his animals—alert and earth-encircling,
o Vaiśvānara, find a way for our formulation. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.
