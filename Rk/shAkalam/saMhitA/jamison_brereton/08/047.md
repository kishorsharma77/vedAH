Ādityas
Trita Āptya
18 verses: mahāpaṅkti
The first two-thirds of this hymn (through vs. 12) beg the Ādityas for general help  and protection from generic evils—the nonspecific nature of what is requested  underlined by the rather redundantly phrased refrain. The refrain continues through  the last third of the hymn (vss. 13–18), but in the non-refrain portions the focus nar
rows—to the elimination of the “bad dream,” which is sent far away to the shadowy  figure called Trita Āptya. Nothing else in the scraps of mythology we know about  Trita Āptya explains why he should be the scapegoated recipient of our nightmares,  much less why he would make them into body ornaments (vs. 15) or use them as  food and work (vs. 16). The agent who removes the bad dream to Trita is Dawn (vss.  14–16, 18), whose participation is easier to understand—as anyone knows who has  experienced the relief of waking in the morning to discover that the nightmares just  experienced were not real.

Great is the help, of (all of) you who are great, for the pious man, o  Varuṇa and Mitra.

Mankind—to which the attentive ones gave peaceful dwelling and  livelihood—
over all its wealth do these Ādityas hold sway.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
## 5
Evils will avoid us, as charioteers avoid hard places.
Might we be in the shelter of Indra and the help of the Ādityas.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help. 6. It is only by a crooked course that in such a way a man becomes lost to  what is given by you.
O gods, o Ādityas, it’s not a trifle that he obtained from you—the man  whom you spurred on.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.

Negligence, sharp or weighty, will never beset him
to whom you, Ādityas, have given broad shelter.

You—deliver us from a great offense; you—from a small one.

Let Aditi deliver us; let Aditi spread her shelter—
the mother of rich Mitra, of Aryaman and Varuṇa.

That sheltering shelter, o gods, beneficial and without damage,
providing threefold defense—spread that out over us.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.

For you, o Ādityas, gaze down (on us), like spies from a hillside.
You will lead us along an easy way like steeds to an easy ford.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
## 12
There is no benefit for the demonic here, for him to descend and to  come near.
There is benefit for the milk-giving cow and for the hero seeking fame. – Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
## 13
Whatever is ill-done in the open, whatever in secret, o gods,
all that set on Trita Āptya, far away from us.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
## 14
The bad dream in the cattle and the one in us, o Daughter of Heaven— carry it away to Trita Āptya, o far-radiant one.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
## 15
He will make (it) his neck ornament or his garland, o Daughter of  Heaven—
the whole bad dream we consign to Trita Āptya.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
## 16
To the one who has it as his food and as his work, to the one reverently  approaching it as his portion—
to Trita and to Dvita, o Dawn, carry the bad dream.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
## 17
Just as we bring back a sixteenth, then an eighth, then the
(whole) debt,
even so we bring the whole bad dream to Āptya.
– Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.

## 18
We have conquered today and we have won; we have become free  of blame.
O Dawn, the bad dream which we have feared, let (dawn) dawn it away. – Your help is faultless; very helpful is your help.
