Viśvāmitra Gāthina
6 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn depicts the beginning of the morning ritual, with the recitation of praise  poetry, the yoking of the pressing stones, and the kindling of the fire. The poet puts  himself at the center of this activity, opening the hymn with a vivid image depicting  his own inspiration as an untethered cow producing abundantly.
