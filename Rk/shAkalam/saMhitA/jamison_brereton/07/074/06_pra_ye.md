The man-protectors of the peoples, keeping the wolf away, who like  chariots have journeyed forth—  
these men swell with their own swelling strength, and they dwell upon a  good dwelling.  
This group of seven Dawn hymns, VII.75–81, is the largest such collection devoted  to this goddess in the R̥gveda, though none of the hymns is very long (ranging from  eight verses to three). The hymns share and recycle much of the same vocabulary and  phraseology, and there are striking phonologically driven lexical responsions across  hymns, which can unfortunately not be rendered in translation. What distinguishes  the hymns from each other is their structure, which can be quite tightly organized  and reinforced by verbal and grammatical markers. See, for example, VII.76.
