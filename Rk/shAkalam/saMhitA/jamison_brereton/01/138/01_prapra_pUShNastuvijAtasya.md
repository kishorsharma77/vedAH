Ever further is (the greatness) of powerfully born Pūṣan proclaimed: the  greatness of him, the powerful, does not flag—the praise of him does  not flag.  
Seeking his favor, I chant to him, whose help is nearby, who is  
refreshment itself,  
who, the bounteous, has bound to himself the mind of everyone—the  bounteous god has bound it to himself.
