This vs. plays on the common contrast, also found earlier in this Marut cycle, between the Maruts as individuals -- here “the last” (caramá-) of them -- and as a collective (víśve).

On sácā as loc. absol. marker, see comm. ad IV.31.5.

I have rendered the nom. pl. kāmínaḥ as an adverb (avidly) to avoid the somewhat heavy ‘having desire (for it)’.
