tát savitúr vṛṇīmahe, vayáṃ devásya bhójanam śréṣṭham sarvadhā́tamam, túram bhágasya dhīmahi Note esp. the first pādas, whose 1st 2 words are identical and whose last words both belong to √vṝ ‘choose’. In the 2nd pāda devásya is identically positioned, and the phrase bhárgaḥ … dhīmahi is echoed by our pāda d bhágasya dhīmahi, but with a diff. noun (bhága-, not bhárgas-). The remainders of the vss. diverge, but the tone is certainly set by pāda a and the similarities of b/d. It is difficult to know what to make of this -- whether the Gāyatrī mantra had already achieved some sort of local fame that lent itself to parodic imitation or whether the similarities are just the result of the usual formulaic underlayer (though there are no other vss. that begin tát savitúr). It’s also somewhat striking (and could be used as an argument either way) that the vs. in our hymn is not a Gāyatrī but an Anuṣṭubh -- and it is the only Anuṣṭubh in a Gāyatrī hymn. If III.62.10 was already known as the (or a) Gāyatrī mantra, our poet could be slyly tweaking that reputation. Or this can all be my post-hoc invention.
