In f prá cakṣaya ródasī vāsayoṣásaḥ, ródasī is most naturally the obj. of prá cakṣaya and uṣásaḥ of vāsaya, but this seems to leave unaccented vāsaya opening its clause. The solution is easily found: in the tag-pāda g the same sequence vāsayoṣásaḥ is preceded in its clause by śrávase. Whether we attribute lack of accent in f to redactional erasure (so Old) or assume that vāsaya was originally unaccented because of its repetition in the tag-pāda does not matter much.
