The ppl. pṛṣṭá- ‘asked (about)’ is a little odd. Ge tr. ‘gesucht’, which would make it less odd, but I don’t think √prach means that. It may be referring to the fact that Indra’s existence and whereabouts are often questioned in the RV.

In b Ge and WG take the simile to be rátho ná vāyúḥ. This of course conforms well to the structure of the pāda and of similes in general, but it has the undesirable consequence of requiring rátha-, a word whose meaning is about as well known as any in the RV, to stand not for ‘chariot’ but for ‘chariot-warrior’ (vel sim.; cf. Ge’s Wagenheld). I therefore, somewhat reluctantly, follow Re. in taking the simile to be ūrdhvó, rátho ná “erect like a chariot.” Re then takes vāyúḥ as a (pseudo-)genitive: “(se tenant) droit comme le char (de) Vāyu,” which is unacceptable for this clear nominative. I instead take vāyúḥ as the beginning of another, unmarked simile. Cf. IX.88.3 vāyúr ná yó niyútvān, with simile marker.
