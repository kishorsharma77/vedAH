Soma Pavamāna
Medhyātithi Kāṇva
6 verses: gāyatrī
This hymn and the next two (IX.41–43) are attributed to Medhyātithi Kāṇva,  the poet of several hymns in Maṇḍala VIII (VIII.1, 3, 33), who names himself  in IX.43.3. This hymn begins strikingly, with an incomplete sentence describing  the stampede of a wild mob, against the “black skin,” presumably the Dasyu  referred to in verse 2. The constituents of the mob are not identified, but are  presumably the soma juices, here mobilized against the non-Ārya enemy. The  second verse rewrites this scene more tranquilly, though with the victory over  the Dasyu more explicit. But the violence of Soma’s purificatory journey returns  in verse 3.
The second half of the hymn is more conventional, though with Soma’s cosmic  associations clear in the last two verses (5–6).
