The accusative phrase in c, pūrvyā́m ánuṣṭutim, makes syntactic trouble here. See disc. by Old, who lays out various possibilities. Ge takes the hemistich as containing a zeugma, with (as far as I can determine) ī́śe read differently with the two pādas -- taking an accusative in c and meaning “Anrecht haben,” while taking a genitive in d and meaning “herrschen über.” But among the numerous occurrences of ī́ś-, I know of none with the meaning or case frame proposed for c. (For further disc.

see comm. ad VII.32.18.) Old suggests either supplying another verb (acodat?) or taking the phrase as an Inhaltsakk. (though in what sense of that term I don’t understand). I take it either as a haplologized *ánu ánuṣṭutim or as an acc. of respect.

(Note that Old rejects Ludwig’s suggestion to read *ánu ṣṭutím, but this would be another possibility in my opinion. What perhaps speaks against that is the other occurrence of ánuṣṭuti- in nearby VIII.63.8.)
