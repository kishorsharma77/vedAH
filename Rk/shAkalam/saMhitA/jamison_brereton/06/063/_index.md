Aśvins
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except ekapadā 11
The first four verses of this hymn are divided more or less equally between the  invitation to and journey of the Aśvins to our sacrifice (vss. 1–2) and the sacrifice  itself (vss. 3–4). The next two verses (5–6) enter mythological territory: the journey  of Sūryā, daughter of the Sun, on the Aśvins’ chariot along with them. This mytho
logical journey returns us to the actual journey of today (vs. 7) and the hopes we  have of these gods when they attend our sacrifice (vs. 8). The final two verses (9–10)  are a dānastuti, naming a number of the patrons of the poet, Bharadvāja, with the  single pāda of verse 11 expressing his hope for the Aśvins’ favor to both himself and  his patrons at the place of sacrifice.
