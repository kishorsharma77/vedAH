As indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. seems meant to illustrate the secret knowledge that we are begging Agni to impart. It clearly concerns (some of) Agniâ€™s actions at the ritual in conjunction with other being(s), but, in the usual fashion of such RVic riddling descriptions, the identity of the referents is left blank and the verbs are not sufficiently precise to define the actions. The publ. tr. gives some tentative identifications, and others are suggested by other tr.; I will not go further here.
