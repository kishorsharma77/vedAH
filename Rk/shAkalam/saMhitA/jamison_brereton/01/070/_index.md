70  
Agni  
Parāśara Śāktya  
11 verses: dvipadā virāj  
As was noted in the introduction to I.68, this last of the Parāśara’s dvipadā virāj hymns  to Agni is the climax of a sequence of three whose disguised subject is Agni Vaiśvānara,  the clan-fire “belonging to all men.” The Vaiśvānara aspects of I.70 were already dis cussed by Proferes (2007: 48). In particular he points to the movement toward the  unity of a single focal fire (vs. 9) contrasted with the separation of this fire into many,  separately served fires (vs. 10), though he fails to mention the verbal encoding of the  underlying compound members in these climactic verses 9–10, where all (víśve) bear  
tribute to the fire (vs. 9) and men (náraḥ) serve him in many places (vs. 10). This hymn also widens the view somewhat, for not only does the fire belong to all  men, but simultaneously to the gods (see the paired divine and human in vss. 2, 4,  and 6), and it is also related to all natural objects (see vss. 3–4, 7), expressed in series  of oppositional merisms, such as “the moving and the still” (vss. 3, 7). This final hymn of the dvipadā virāj series has eleven verses, rather than the ten  found in the other hymns. This eleventh, unpaired verse describes the power, skill,  and eagerness of the martial Agni, and thus expresses one of the roles for which the  Vaiśvānara fire is especially designed: to unite the clans into a force able to oppose  its enemies. (See Proferes 2007 passim.) It may be taken as a summary verse for the  entire sequence of Vaiśvānara hymns.
