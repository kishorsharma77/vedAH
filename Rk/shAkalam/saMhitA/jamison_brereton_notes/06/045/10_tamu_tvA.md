After the opening tám u tvā, the rest of the hemistich consists only of vocc.

satya somapā, índra vājānām pate, with only a single accent among them: índra is accented because it’s initial in its pāda, while the gen. pl. vājānām is unaccented because it’s part of a voc. phrase. Note that in the HvN ed. vājānā́m bears an impossible, final-syllable accent, a typo that should be deleted.
