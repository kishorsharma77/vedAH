As discussed in the publ. intro., this verse seems to display extended double reference between three gods associated with the morning pressing and the Aśvins’ chariot, an association produced by shared epithets, though I must admit that there are many loose ends in this interpretation. See also Re’s n.

In pāda a párijman- ‘earth-encircler’ is a standard epithet of their chariot (I.20.3, IV.45.1, X.39.1, X.41.1, IV.3.6)(and, in the dual, of the Aśvins themselves: I.46.14, X.106.3). In a verse in an Aśvin hymn in which this is the first real word, it is hard to imagine that an audience would not first think of their chariot. However, the term also qualifies the Wind (e.g., VII.40.6, II.38.2), and the rest of pāda a, tánayasya majmánā, fits a divinity better than a chariot.

In its other three occurrences dvimātár- ‘having two mothers’ refers to Agni, as produced by the two kindling sticks. It is somewhat difficult to see how this word could refer to the chariot, unless the Aśvins are configured as two mothers. On the other hand the phrase dhūrṣú taráṇayaḥ, like our tūrṣú taráṇiḥ, is found in an Aśvin hymn (VII.6.78) qualifying their horses in a verse also containing their chariot. (Cf. also taráṇi- twice in another Aśvin hymn [IV.45.5, 7], but used of a priest, probably Agni.) Note also that tūrṣú not only plays on the dhūrṣú in the passage just cited, but also phonologically matches the ū ṣú of this hymn’s refrain.

In c vicakṣaná- ‘wide-gazing’ is otherwise esp. found as an epithet of Soma, though occasionally of other gods. As a qualifier of a chariot, it could mean ‘conspicuous’ (< ‘widely seen’). What it would mean for either Soma or the chariot to be ‘of triple thought’ (trimántu-) is not clear to me. The word is a hapax, but it should be interpreted along with the mántave of 2b, where the word is connected with an image (however attenuated) of a chariot. It’s worth keeping in mind that the Aśvins’ chariot is characterized as having three of everything in I.34.2, 9, 12, and its three wheels are mentioned elsewhere. As for a potential connection with Soma, the ‘three’ of course suggests the three soma pressings, though exactly what the -mántuwould have to do with them isn’t clear to me. Perhaps more likely is the three types of ritual speech deployed in the soma sacrifice.

Note that there is an implicit numerical ordering of the subjects of the three pādas: (párijman = 1), dvimātár-, trimántu-.

In sum, although the vocabulary of this verse has tantalizing resonances with other passages and although I am fairly certain there is a pervasive double meaning, I do not feel I (or anyone else) has entirely “cracked” this verse. The tack taken by Ge (/WG) of simply taking Parijman, Dvimātar, and Trimantu as PNs is the easy way out but does not advance the interpretation.
