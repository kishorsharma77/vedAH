The Ārya obstacles are presumably peoples akin to us, but fighting against us.

As noted in the publ. intro., Indra’s apparent weapons of “well-placed cloaks” (súdhitebhir átkaiḥ) are puzzling. I think this is a reference to Indra’s shape-shifting ability, to wear “different hats” in different situations -- and Ge’s parallels in n. 3c suggest that he is of the same opinion. Old discusses at length and uncharacteristically endorses the suggested emendation of Ludwig/Bergaigne of átkaiḥ to arkaíḥ, though he does admit it's hard to explain how the corruption would have arisen. I think this is a fairly insuperable problem, esp. since súdhita- is not a particularly likely descriptor of ‘chants’, and is in fact not found with words of that sort.

As also noted in the publ. intro., I suspect that súdhita- is a buried play on words. It is stationed between váneva “like the woods, trees” and átkaiḥ. In conjunction with the former, it evokes svádhiti- ‘hatchet, axe’; cf., for similar context, X.89.7 jaghā́na vrtrá ̥ ṃ svádhitir váneva “He smote Vr̥tra, like an axe the trees.” For another pun involving svádhiti-, see V.32.10 where the “Heavenly Hatchet” (devī́svádhitiḥ) probably plays on svadhā́- ‘independent power’. See comm. ad loc. As already pointed out ad VI.4.7, nṛtama is not suitable for the cadence of any Vedic meter, and save for this passage and VI.4.7 it avoids this position. It is found several times with nṛṇā́m in the cadence but in the reverse order: IV.25.4 nṛ́tamāya nṛṇā́m, V.30.12, X.29.2 nṛ́tamasya nṛṇā́m, where the oblique forms of nṛ́tamasupport a good Triṣṭubh cadence. The order may have been flipped here, but why?
