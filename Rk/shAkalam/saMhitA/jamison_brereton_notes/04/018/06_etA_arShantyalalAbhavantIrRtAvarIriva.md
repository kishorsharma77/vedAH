As suggested in the publ. intro., the (real) waters in the amniotic sac that “break” right before birth and the (mythological) waters confined by Vṛtra and released by Indra are conflated here. Indra may be speaking from within the womb about the waters there battering the womb itself for release, though the waters in the Vṛtra myth would not be far from the audience’s mind. If Indra the fetus is immersed in these amniotic fluids, their sloshing sounds would surround him -- and it would be appropriate to ask his mother what they are saying.

The simile in b, ṛtā́varīr iva saṃkróśamāṇāḥ “like truthful women together shouting their witness” may have a quasi-legal resonance. The root √kruś is later used for raising a hue and cry on witnessing a crime (vel sim.), such as a Rākṣasa abduction (see my Sacr.Wife 233). Configuring the waters as truthful and articulate witnesses in this pāda leads directly to the suggestion in the next pāda that they should be asked what they are saying.
