Though as just noted, 7cd should be construed with this verse, the main clause to which those rel. clauses should be attached is incomplete - having a referent tám for the yáḥ of 7c, but no main verb. Ge supplies “rufet,” which seems the simplest solution, extracted from the two forms of hávyaḥ in cd.

Gr, Ge take ā́raṇa- as ‘depths’, presumably as a contextual antonym to gā́dha- ‘ford’, putatively < *‘shallow’ (but see EWA s.v.). But there seems no good reason to separate ā́raṇa- from áraṇa- ‘alien, foreign’ and its relatives, esp. since a ford is a ‘shallow’ only indirectly. The other occurrence of ā́raṇa- (I.112.6) is not in an antonymic context; Ge renders it “in der Grube” (pit), but there is no external support for this tr.
