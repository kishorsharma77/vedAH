  <p>India has a magnificent tradition of religious literature stretching over three and a  half millennia, with a vast range of styles and subjects—from almost impersonal  reflections on the mysteries of the cosmos, the divine, and humankind’s relation  to them to deeply intimate expressions of worship. This literature is justly cele brated, not only within the religious traditions that gave rise to the various works  but around the world among people with no ties to those religious traditions. The  R̥gveda is the first of these monuments, and it can stand with any of the subse quent ones. Its range is very large—encompassing profound and uncompromising  meditations on cosmic enigmas, joyful and exuberant tributes to the wonders of the  world, ardent praise of the gods and their works, moving and sometimes painful  expressions of personal devotion, and penetrating reflections on the ability of mor tals to make contact with and affect the divine and cosmic realms through sacrifice  and praise. Thus, much of what will distinguish later Indian religious literature is  already present in the R̥gveda. Yet, though its name is known, the celebration of the  R̥gveda is muted at best, even within its own tradition, and, save for a few famous  hymns, its contents go unnoticed outside of that tradition.</p>
<p>India also has a magnificent literary tradition, characterized in great part by  sophisticated poetic techniques and devices and a poetic self-consciousness that  glories in the transformative work that words can effect on their subjects. Again, the R̥gveda is the first monument of this literary tradition and at least the equal  of the later literature. The exuberance with which the poets press the boundaries  of language in order to create their own reflection of the complex and ultimately  impenetrable mysteries of the cosmos and the verbal devices they developed to mir ror these cosmic intricacies resonate through the rest of the literary tradition. Yet,  again, the R̥gveda figures very little in standard accounts of Indian literature and is  little read or appreciated as literature.</p>
<p>Thus the R̥gveda is not only the beginning but also one of the paramount expressions  of both the religious tradition and the literary tradition, combining these two roles in  a text that displays great variety, skill, and beauty. Surely it deserves a modern English  translation that makes these riches available to a wider audience. Yet it does not have  one; the only readily available complete English translation, the nineteenth-century  product of R. T. H. Griffith, conceals rather than reveals the wonders of the R̥gveda  and would (properly) discourage any sensitive reader from further pursuit of the text.  Why this lacuna? The answer is quite simple: the R̥gveda is very long and very hard.  Neither of these factors alone would necessarily hinder translation—both very long  texts, like the Sanskrit epics, and very hard texts, like the Avestan Gāthās, are receiving  their due—but the combination of the two has proved very daunting. We two translators, after some fifteen years of concentrated effort on the translation and more than  forty years of living with and working with the text, can attest to the rigors of the  task—but even more to its joys. And we feel privileged to have spent so much time in  intimate contact with the poets who shaped such an extraordinary religious and liter ary achievement at the very dawn of the Indian tradition.</p>
<p>In the introduction that follows we try to give readers some grounding in the  world and worldview of the R̥gveda and to provide enough information to approach  the translation without undue bafflement. It is not meant as a comprehensive treatment of the many subjects touched on, but only a stepping stone to the text itself  and the readers’ direct experience of the hymns.</p>
<h2 id="i-who-what-where-when">I. Who, What, Where, When?</h2>
<h3 id="a-veda-and-rgveda">A. Veda and R̥gveda</h3>
<p>The R̥gveda is the oldest Sanskrit text, composed in an archaic form of the language, known as Vedic or Vedic Sanskrit. It is a collection of over a thousand  poems, composed by a number of different poets over the course of some consid erable period of time. The poems are primarily hymns praising various gods and  ritual elements and procedures, designed to be recited during ritual performance;  that is, they are liturgical compositions. However, they are also finely crafted and  self-conscious literary productions of the highest quality.</p>
<p>As the first text in Sanskrit, the R̥gveda is somewhat isolated, and many of  the difficulties of its interpretation stem from the fact that there are no parallel  or closely contemporary texts. Yet, it is poised between two bodies of textual material that can contribute to its interpretation, and the characteristic features  from these two types of texts, mingled uniquely in the R̥gveda, help account for  its distinctive quality. On the one hand, it stands at the end of a long tradition of  Indo-European and Indo-Iranian praise poetry, most nearly mirrored in the Old  Avestan Gāthās attributed to Zarathustra. On the other, it stands as the earliest  of the ritual texts collectively known as the Vedas and forms a part of the inter locking ritual system set forth in the Vedas.</p>
<p>There are four Vedas: the R̥gveda, Sāmaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. The  first three are the provinces of individual priests, who function together to per form the solemn rituals of the Vedic liturgical system, later, in the middle Vedic  period, known as śrauta rituals. Each of those three Vedas also represents a different type of ritual speech. Thus, the R̥gveda belongs to the Hotar priest, who recites or chants the poetry; the Sāmaveda to the Udgātar priest, who sings the poetry to  set tunes called sāmans. The vast majority of the verbal material in the Sāmaveda  is borrowed from the R̥gveda. The Yajurveda is the realm of the Adhvaryu priest;  his verbal product is the yajus, a short verbal formula that generally accompanies  the physical actions that are the main task of the Adhvaryu. Each of these three  priests is accompanied by other priests who share their principal functions. So in  the later soma ritual, for example, the number of priests can be sixteen or seventeen. The Atharvaveda stands outside of this ritual system and consists primarily  of hymns and spells of a more “popular” nature, often magical or healing. Despite  its lack of connection to the solemn ritual, the Atharvaveda is especially important  for R̥gvedic studies because it is linguistically the closest text to the R̥gveda and is  thus the second oldest text in Sanskrit. The two texts also share a number of pas sages and hymns, although the Atharvaveda often varies the wording or order of  verses. The R̥gvedic hymns found also in the Atharvaveda are often drawn from the  younger layers of the R̥gveda.</p>
<p>We will treat the structure of the text in more detail below; here we will pro vide only the most general outline. The text consists of 1028 hymns divided into  ten books or maṇḍalas (lit. “circles”), of varying lengths. The arrangement of the  hymns within each maṇḍala and the arrangement of the maṇḍalas themselves attest  strongly to the deliberate quality of the collection and organization of the hymns,  as we will demonstrate below. Maṇḍalas II–VII are known as the “Family Books,”  each attributed to a different bardic family. Maṇḍala VIII contains smaller collections attributed to particular poets or poetic families, and has a somewhat aberrant character. Maṇḍala IX contains all and only the hymns dedicated to Soma  Pavamāna, “self-purifying soma,” the deified ritual drink at a particular moment in  its ritual preparation.+++(5)+++ Maṇḍalas I and X were added to the collection later, though  they both contain much that is contemporaneous with the linguistic and religious  level of the core parts of the R̥gveda, as well as some more recent and “popular”  material. Both I and X contain exactly 191 hymns, a synchronicity that was clearly  not by chance.</p>
<h3 id="b-date-and-cultural-context-of-the-rgveda">B. Date and Cultural Context of the R̥gveda</h3>
<p>As was mentioned above, the R̥gveda is part of the long tradition of Indo-European  praise poetry, composed and performed orally and deploying inherited set verbal  formulae, on which the poets also ring changes. Thus, whatever date(s) we assign  to the actual composition of the particular hymns found in the text, the temporal  horizon of the R̥gveda stretches a good deal further back, in that the poetic techniques and even some of its precise verbal realizations go back many centuries, even  millennia.</p>
<p>The dating of the R̥gveda has been and is likely to remain a matter of contention  and reconsideration because as yet little has been uncovered in the material record  or in the hymns themselves that allows us to date the period of the R̥gvedic hymns.  One attempt at dating begins with an absence. Since the R̥gveda does not mention  iron but does mention other kinds of metal, it is likely a pre–Iron Age, Bronze Age  text. The dates at which iron appears in the archaeological record in South Asia  differ in different parts of the subcontinent. For the northwest, which comprises  the geographic horizon of the R̥gveda, iron began to be manufactured around  1200–1000 bce. The R̥gvedic hymns, therefore, would have to have been composed  no later than this period. However, iron is attested in the Atharvaveda. While the  R̥gveda is older than the Atharvaveda, there is no basis for assuming a substantial  gap in time between the end of the R̥gvedic period and the Atharvaveda. Therefore  the date of the latest portions of the R̥gveda is not likely to be very much earlier that  1200–1000 bce. It is also likely that the period of the composition of R̥gvedic hymns  did not extend more than several centuries before this terminus ad quem. Witzel (in  Jamison and Witzel 1992: 2 n. 2) has noted that the poets and kings mentioned in  the anukramaṇīs (indices) and in the hymns themselves comprise perhaps five or six  generations. Generously rounding these numbers, we can then place the period of  the composition of the R̥gvedic hymns sometime within the period 1400–1000 bce or, even more approximately, within the second half of the second millennium bce.  At best these dates encompass only the hymns of the R̥gveda as we have them. The  poetic conventions on which the R̥gveda was built are very much older, extending  back to the Indo-Iranian period with roots into the Indo-European period. The  R̥gveda is only the surface of a very deep tradition.</p>
<p>While the date of the R̥gveda remains problematic, the hymns provide informa tion that helps identify the geographic area in which the hymns were composed.  Above all, the rivers mentioned in the text help establish the place of the R̥gveda.  These rivers range from the Kabul and Kurram rivers in present-day Afghanistan  to the Ganges in the east. Its center is the greater Punjab, the region of the Indus  and its major tributaries. Following the likely internal chronology of the R̥gveda,  geographic references in the text suggest a movement from the northwest toward  the east. Thus while the earliest parts of the R̥gveda were likely composed in the  northwest, in the latest parts of the text the area has extended further into the  subcontinent, and its center has shifted toward Kurukṣetra, roughly the area of the  modern state of Haryana.</p>
<p>One of the reasons that the R̥gveda is difficult to date is that there is no material  evidence that we can clearly associate with the people who composed the R̥gveda,  the people who called themselves Āryas. Nor would we expect very much material  evidence, since the hymns make no mention of any permanent religious structures  or enduring settlements. The Āryas formed instead a semi-nomadic pastoralist  society, in which seasons of settlement alternated with seasons of migration. This  migration likely contributed to the extension of the culture into new areas. The  period of movement was also the season of conflict in the competition for land and  the season of cattle-raiding, especially for younger males eager to acquire assets on  which to establish their own livelihood. Cattle were the primary source of wealth,  although the hymns also mention sheep, buffaloes, goats, and camels. Horses too  were essential and prized, since they enabled the Āryas’ mobility and contributed  to their success in battle. Although the economy was fundamentally pastoral, the  Āryas practiced some agriculture during the times of settlement; one hymn (IV.57)  specifically celebrates agricultural divinities, and the plow is occasionally men tioned. The hymns refer to yáva “barley” or “field grain,” which was used both for  food and in the rituals. The R̥gveda does not attest rice cultivation.</p>
<p>In addition to the absence of material remains, another difficulty in describing the cultural context of the R̥gveda is that its hymns depict only a part of the  religion and society at the period.+++(5)+++ First, the R̥gveda represents the continuation of  an elite tradition also attested in the Avesta and therefore quite ancient. As such,  it reflects the religious practice only of the upper strata of Ārya society. Second, it  is primarily a collection of liturgical hymns for use in the soma sacrifice, surely the  most prestigious ritual of the period but still only one kind of ritual, representing  a particular and limited set of religious concerns. Finally, the soma sacrifices were  sponsored and performed by socially elite men, and they reflected the religious concerns of these men. The text did not directly address the religious lives of women  or of other social classes nor indeed even other aspects of the religious lives of elite  males. Thus, while the R̥gveda is a sizable text and from it we can derive a great  deal of information about the soma rite and about those who participated in it,  we are still dealing only with a segment of Ārya religion and society. However, we  can gather information on non-elite concerns and on the daily life and pursuits of  the elite incidentally, often through similes or imagery modeling ritual elements  and procedures or through the crediting of gods with activities also appropriate to  humans, such as warfare.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>Indirectly, we can also get some information about other aspects of religion.  First, although the soma rite was primarily focused on the god Indra, already in  the R̥gvedic period it had begun to incorporate the worship of gods around whom  independent ritual traditions existed. So, for example, the Aśvins were worshiped  already during the Indo-Iranian period and in the Pravargya rite, which is not a  soma ritual. But already in the R̥gvedic period the Aśvins were recipients of soma,  and by the time of the later Veda the Pravargya rite had been incorporated into  the soma tradition. Moreover, especially in book X, there are hymns that address a variety of religious interests separate from those of the soma rite. There are funeral  (X.14–16) and wedding (X.85) hymns. There are hymns against cowives (X.145),  against rivals (X.166), against witchcraft (X.155), against miscarriage (X.162), and  against disease (X.161, 163). There are hymns for the safety of cattle (X.169), for  conception (X.183), and for successful birth (X.184). In short the R̥gveda already  attests rites that address domestic and individual issues principally associated with  the Atharvaveda. These hymns point to substantial ritual activity outside of the  soma rituals.+++(5)+++</p>
<h3 id="c-what-do-the-hymns-do">C. What Do the Hymns Do?</h3>
<p>The overwhelming majority of R̥gvedic hymns have as their major aim to praise the  god(s) to whom the hymn is dedicated and to induce said god(s) to repay the praise  with requested favors. To a certain extent different gods receive different types of  praise, but the praise generally focuses on the appearance, qualities, and power of  the gods and on their remarkable deeds. Some divinities attract particular attention to their appearance: for instance, the seductive beauty of Dawn, the glittering  ostentation of the Maruts, the endlessly fascinating transformations of physical fire  and its divine embodiment Agni.+++(5)+++ Others, like the Ādityas, have few if any physical  characteristics, but are more celebrated for their mental and moral qualities. The  supernatural powers of almost all the gods receive abundant praise, though again  the types of power lauded differ from god to god.</p>
<p>Their powers are actualized in their deeds, the recounting of which occupies a  large portion of many R̥gvedic hymns. Some gods have a robust narrative mythol ogy, and episodes from this mythology are constantly related or alluded to; the  most prominent example is Indra with his catalogue of great victories over both  divine and mortal enemies. Those without much narrative mythology tend to be  credited with general cosmogonic deeds or with the regular maintaining and order ing of the world and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>This praise of divine powers and deeds is not a disinterested act, for the aim  is to persuade or constrain the gods to mobilize these same powers on behalf of  their worshipers and to replicate their great deeds in the present for the benefit of  these same worshipers. In the all-pervasive system of reciprocity and exchange that  might be termed the dominant social ideology underlying the R̥gveda, praise of the  gods requires requital: they must provide recompense for what they receive from  those praising them. Worshipers are not shy about specifying what they want in  exchange: the good things of this world—wealth, especially in livestock and gold,  sons, and a long lifespan—and divine aid in defeating opponents, be they enemies  in battle or rival sacrificers. The sign that the praise has been successful is the epiphany of the god(s) addressed+++(5)+++, so that many hymns urgently invite the dedicand(s)  to journey to the particular sacrifice in which the poet is participating and then  jubilantly proclaim the arrival of the god(s) at that particular sacrificial ground as  the ritual is taking place.</p>
<p>This epiphany at the sacrifice brings us back to the liturgical role of the hymns,  for it should never be forgotten that almost all the hymns in the R̥gveda were com posed to accompany the physical acts of the ritual, which are happening simultaneously with the recitation. But the word “accompany” here is too weak. The hymns  are not merely verbal background music, as it were. As will be discussed further  below, another important aspect of Vedic ideology is the belief in the power of the  word: words make things happen.+++(5)+++ The physical actions of ritual alone would be  insufficient; it is the skillfully crafted, properly formulated hymn, the verbal portion  of the ritual, that makes the liturgical acts effective.</p>
<p>While the great majority of R̥gvedic hymns have a liturgical form that obviously  reflects the soma rite, there are examples in which this model is not evident. Among  them are the ākhyāna or “narrative” hymns, as Oldenberg (1883, 1885) called them,  which take the form of a dialogue between two or more figures.+++(5)+++ These hymns occur  in the later portions of the R̥gveda, especially book X. They include, for example,  dialogues between the sage Agastya and his wife Lopāmudrā (I.179); between Yama  and his twin sister Yamī (X.10); between the celestial Apsaras Urvaśī and her abandoned mortal husband Purūravas (X.95); among the monkey Vr̥ṣākapi, the god  Indra, and Indra’s wife Indrāṇī (X.86); and between Indra’s dog, Saramā, and the  tribe of Paṇis (X.108). It is possible that some of these hymns comment on the  soma rite, but others were composed for different ritual purposes, which have to be  surmised, if they can be surmised at all, from the contents of the hymns. Our introductions to individual hymns discuss possible applications. A few may represent  individual or domestic concerns, such as the recovery of lost cattle (X.108); others may embody the differing viewpoints of ongoing ritual controversies (I.179) or  provide a dramatic modeling of a particularly important ritual (the Horse Sacrifice  in X.86) or the mythological underpinning for a series of hymns (X.10 for the following funeral hymns). An evergreen controversy concerns the form of the ākhyāna  hymns. Oldenberg (1885) argued that the oldest type of epic composition mixed  poetry and prose. The poetry principally consisted of the words spoken by characters in the narrative, and the prose provided the narrative context for the verses.  This form is found in the Pāli Jātakas, the stories of the Buddha’s former births, for  example, in which the verses are considered canonical but the connecting prose is  not. Oldenberg suggested that the ākhyāna hymns conformed to this type and that  what we have preserved is a skeleton of canonical dialogue that originally had prose  narrative attached to it. Oldenberg’s theory has the advantage of explaining why  these hymns are difficult to interpret and why even the speakers of particular verses  are not readily identifiable. While we find the theory attractive, many scholars have  found it unnecessary and understand these hymns to have been recited as they are  transmitted to us.</p>
<p>There are also hymns that, though they may be ritually employed in the later Veda,  were perhaps not composed for ritual use. Gonda (1978: 25–38) compares some of  these hymns to medieval stotras: expressions of emotion, praise, and devotion to the  gods. However, such functions do not preclude their application in rites, even if their original ritual context is not clear to us. A better possibility for non-liturgical hymns  is the type that comments on the ritual and its meaning. Generally occurring in the  latest strata of the R̥gveda, these include X.129, the Nāsadīyasūkta (“that not existing did not exist”); X.121, the Hiraṇyagarbhasūkta (“Golden Embryo”); X.90, the  Puruṣasūkta (“Hymn of the Man”); and I.164, the “Riddle Hymn” of Dīrghatamas.  These are sometimes called the “philosophical” or “speculative” hymns of the  R̥gveda, but this is a misleading description, since they are not primarily abstract  philosophic reflections on the nature of things. Rather, they are better viewed as  forerunners of the Brāhmaṇa and Āraṇyaka texts that interpret the ritual in general,  particular rituals, or aspects of the ritual.+++(5)+++ So, for example, X.90 comments on the  sacrifice through the symbol of the “Man,” which represents both the world and the  sacrifice. X.121 concerns the royal consecration rite, and X.129 sets forth the creative  power of knowledge and therefore the power of the poets and priests who possess  it. In many of these hymns the meaning of the ritual is expressed in terms of a cosmogony or cosmology. While such hymns share many themes and draw upon common stores of symbols, there is not a single R̥gvedic cosmogony or a single R̥gvedic  cosmology to which they refer. Rather, they represent imaginable worlds that explain  why things are as they are. To force the hymns into the straitjacket of a unitary view  of the world underestimates the power and originality of the poets who produced  these cosmogonic and cosmological models.</p>
<h3 id="d-the-poet">D. The Poet</h3>
<p>Who is the poet, and why is he composing poetry? The poets participate in an  elaborate patronage system. They are hirelings, but of a very superior sort. As  craftsmen of the word, their contribution to the success of the sacrifice that establishes and maintains the mutually beneficial relationship between men and gods is  critical, and they serve the patrons, often royal patrons (whatever “royal” meant at  this period), who arrange for and underwrite the sacrifice. The poet provides the  praise poetry that the patron needs to put the gods in his debt, and he speaks on  behalf of his patron, in making specific requests of the gods for goods and services.  The poet’s reward comes as a second-hand or indirect benefit of the success of his  verbal labors: the patron should receive from the gods what he asked for, and he  provides some portion of that bounty to the poet in recompense.+++(5)+++ This payment  from his patron is sometimes celebrated by the poet at the end of his hymn, in a  genre known as the dānastuti+++(5)+++, literally “praise of the gift,” in which the largesse of  the patron—cows, horses, gold, women—is catalogued and glorified. Or, if it is less  than expected or desired, scorned. The tone of the dānastuti is often teasing and  jokey, and the language colloquial.</p>
<p>But the making of poetry is not simply a business proposition. Poets take great  pride in their work and often reflect on their part in the poetic tradition and also on  their ability to use the tools of the tradition in innovative and creative ways. They  are self-conscious, naming themselves and addressing themselves, calling attention to their verbal tricks and achievements and their ability to bring fame and material  success to their patrons and glory to their gods. Some poets have very distinctive  poetic personalities, as we will have occasion to remark throughout the translation.</p>
<p>The R̥gvedic poet’s social position and his role in the patronage economy was  clearly inherited from Indo-Iranian and Indo-European times, and one of the  closest parallels is found in ancient Greek, in the poetry of Pindar (5th century  bce), who was hired to celebrate the victors in the various Greek games and did so  in verse as elaborate, finely crafted, and deliberately obscure as that found in the  R̥gveda. For further on the Indo-European poet, see Watkins (1995).</p>
<h3 id="e-structure-of-the-rgveda">E. Structure of the R̥gveda</h3>
<p>The R̥gveda comprises 1028 sūktas or hymns, which contain a total of slightly more  than 10,500 verses and which are divided into ten maṇḍalas, or books, of uneven  size. Within each maṇḍala there is a further division of the hymns into anuvākas  or “recitations” consisting of several hymns. The number of hymns in an anuvāka  varies within a maṇḍala, and the number of anuvākas in each maṇḍala varies from  maṇḍala to maṇḍala. As its name suggests, the anuvāka division was created prin cipally to provide convenient units for memorization and recitation. Although this  division is occasionally indicated in editions of the R̥gveda, we have not included  it in the translation.</p>
<p>There is a second division of the R̥gvedic corpus into eight  aṣṭakas, but this is a purely mechanical arrangement also created to facilitate memorization. In this latter division each of the eight aṣṭakas has eight adhyāyas, each  adhyāya has thirty-three vargas, and each varga has five verses.</p>
<p>Since unlike the division of the text into maṇḍalas, neither of these divisions reflects the contents of the  R̥gveda, therefore we will use the division into maṇḍalas exclusively. Invaluable work on the organization and history of the R̥gveda was done by  Bergaigne (1886, 1887)  and Oldenberg (1888:  191–270), ably summarized and  amplified by Witzel (1995a, 1997). Following their work, the structure of the R̥gveda  and the broad outlines of its compositional history are as follows.</p>
<h4 id="family-books">Family Books</h4>
<p>The core of the  R̥gveda and its oldest part are the “Family Books,” so called because the hymns in  each maṇḍala are attributed to poets belonging to the same family lineage. These  comprise Maṇḍalas II–VII. The family lineages are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>II Gr̥tsamada</li>
<li>III Viśvāmitra</li>
<li>IV Vāmadeva</li>
<li>V Atri</li>
<li>VI Bharadvāja</li>
<li>VII Vasiṣṭha</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the R̥gvedic corpus, the six Family Books are generally ordered according  to the increasing number of hymns in each successive maṇḍala.+++(5)+++ So Maṇḍala II contains the fewest number of hymns and VII the greatest. Within each Family Book the hymns are ordered first by deity.+++(5)+++ Thus the hymns to Agni come first, followed  by those to Indra. After these collections are the hymns to other deities, generally  arranged by the decreasing number of hymns to each deity within the maṇḍala.+++(4)+++  Within each deity collection the hymns are arranged by their length, beginning with  the longest hymns.+++(5)+++ If two hymns are of equal length, they are ordered according to  meter, with the hymns in longer meters placed before those in shorter meters.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>The arrangement of the Family Books and their hymns, therefore, functions  like an index. If you know the poet (and therefore the family of the poet), the deity  to whom the hymn is addressed, the number of verses in the hymn, and the meter,  then, in principle at least, you can locate the hymn within the collection. Perhaps  for that reason, the oral recitation of a R̥gvedic hymn is traditionally preceded by  the identification of the poet, deity, and meter. It is this kind of information that is  provided by the anukramaṇīs or indices to the R̥gveda. Because the anukramaṇīs  come from a later period, there has been some question about the value of their  information for the R̥gvedic period. Some of the identifications of poets, in book X  in particular, are derived from the content of the hymns and can be rather wonderfully fantastic.+++(4)+++ In that book, for example, there are hymns attributed to serpents  (X.76 and 94), to the “Golden Embryo,” Hiraṇyagarbha (X.121), to the god Indra  (X.48–50), and to Yama (X.14) and Yamī (X.154), the first humans. Such identifications are not exclusive to book X. Among the possible composers of VIII.67 are  listed Matsya Sāmmada, king of the sea creatures, and fish that have been caught  in a net. Also, in the ākhyāna hymns and any other hymn in which the verses are  supposed to be spoken by a god or a legendary being, the anukramaṇīs ascribe  authorship to that god or being. Thus, the composition of the dialogue among the  monkey Vr̥ṣākapi, the god Indra, and his wife Indrāṇī (X.86) is attributed to the  three of them.</p>
<p>However, these creative identifications are much more the exception than the  rule. Even though the anukramaṇīs were composed and redacted long after the  R̥gvedic period, they are an invaluable resource, for, by and large, their identifications of the poets of hymns are plausible. The collections they mark by assigning  groups of hymns to certain poets or poetic circles correspond to the organization of  the R̥gveda and to verbal, metrical, and thematic connections among these hymns.  The great majority of the roughly five hundred poets named in the anukramaṇīs  also appear in Pravara lists of brahmin ancestors (Mahadevan forthcoming), which  supports the plausibility of the anukramaṇī identifications. Therefore, the tradi tions transmitted in the anukramaṇīs can be a helpful guide in understanding rela tionships among hymns, in identifying collections of hymns, and in determining the  relative ages of hymns.</p>
<h4 id="maṇḍala-viii">Maṇḍala VIII</h4>
<p>Generally younger than the Family Books, Maṇḍala VIII largely comprises the  hymns of two poetic traditions: that of the Kāṇvas (in 1–48 and 60–66) and that  of the Āṅgirases (in 67–103).+++(4)+++ The hymns of the Āṅgirasa group are probably some what younger than those of the Kāṇva group. However, not all the hymns in either  of these two groups are from Kāṇva or Āṅgirasa poets. Rather, both collections include hymns by poets who belong to other families and are known in other  maṇḍalas. These hymns were probably added to book VIII because they were composed in forms and meters characteristic of the hymns of VIII.+++(4)+++ Both the Kāṇva  and the Āṅgirasa collections in VIII consist of a large number of hymns whose  verses are arranged in pragāthas or tr̥cas, that is, in sequences of units (strophes)  consisting of two or three verses.+++(5)+++ There are pragāthas and tr̥cas outside of VIII and  non-strophic hymns in VIII, but because of the predominance of these structures  in that book, pragātha and tr̥ca poetry of various poets was relocated into VIII.  The significance of this collection is not entirely clear, although the marked forms  of the hymns suggest that they or the priests who produced them may have had a  distinct ritual function, and it is noteworthy that a large proportion of the R̥gvedic  material borrowed into the Sāmaveda comes from VIII. It may be that the priests  who created Maṇḍala VIII were, like the Sāmavedic priests, those who chanted  R̥gvedic verses. The arrangement of hymns in VIII generally follows that of the  Family Books: they are first organized by poet or poetic circle and then by deity.+++(5)+++  But the organization of the book is less transparent than that of the Family Books.</p>
<h4 id="maṇḍala-i">Maṇḍala I</h4>
<p>Maṇḍala I also consists of two collections. One, I.51–191, probably dates from  around the time of the Kāṇva hymns of VIII, and the other, I.1–50, is slightly later  than the Āṅgirasa hymns of VIII. The collection of I.51–191 consists of the hymns  of nine groups of poets, organized according to the same principles as the Family  Books.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>The collection of I.1–50 consists of hymns in six groups, each attributed to  a single poet. Within each of these six groups, the hymns are collected by deity, but  the six differ in their arrangement of the hymns within the deity collections.+++(4)+++ The  groups of I.1–50 are also distinguished by the prevalence of hymns in gāyatrī meter  and in pragāthas, like the hymns of VIII, while the hymns of I.51–191 are primarily  in triṣṭubh and jagatī meter.</p>
<h4 id="maṇḍala-ix">Maṇḍala IX</h4>
<p>Maṇḍala IX is unusual, because it is a liturgical collection of hymns to Soma  Pavamāna, the soma “purifying itself” as it runs across or through the sheep’s wool  filter. It includes hymns by poets already known from the Family Books as well as  by later poets. The collection is dominated especially by poets from books I, V, and  VIII. It was therefore created after the Family Books and contains hymns from  various periods. Like the Family Books, it is arranged in groups according to meter  and then within each metrical grouping, according to decreasing number of verses.+++(5)+++</p>
<h4 id="maṇḍala-x">Maṇḍala X</h4>
<p>Maṇḍala X is a collection of hymns that belong to the youngest strata of the  R̥gveda and forms a kind of appendix to the text. However, it shows organizational  principles comparable to those we have seen in the other books. It consists of collections of hymns by individual poets, which are ordered according to the decreasing  number of hymns in each collection or, when collections contain an equal number  of hymns, according to the number of verses in the first hymn of the collection. By  roughly the second half of X, the collections are reduced to single hymns by individual poets. Finally, there is a short and late supplement to the R̥gvedic collection,  the Vālakhilya hymns, which are collected in VIII.49–59.</p>
<h4 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h4>
<p>While this is the general organization of the text, there are many exceptions  to these ordering principles. So, for example, we remarked above that the Family  Books, II–VII, are ordered from the shortest to the longest. While this is generally  true, it is not completely the case. Consider the list of the Family Books and the  total number of hymns in each:</p>
<ul>
<li>II 43 hymns</li>
<li>III 62 hymns</li>
<li>IV 58 hymns</li>
<li>V 87 hymns</li>
<li>VI 75 hymns</li>
<li>VII 104 hymns</li>
</ul>
<p>Although we would have expected the sequence of maṇḍalas to show a steadily  increasing number of hymns, instead book IV has fewer hymns than III and book VI  fewer than V. In a similar fashion, hymns can appear out of order within the various  groupings that make up both the Family Books and the other books of the R̥gveda.  Such discrepancies have arisen through insertions of hymns and redactional combinations and divisions of hymns. These alterations occurred after the initial collection of the R̥gveda, when the order of books and hymns was established, and by  the time or at the time of Śākalya’s final redaction of the text around the middle  of first millennium bce. Attention to these discrepancies can be an effective tool  in reconstructing the compositional history of individual hymns and of groupings  of hymns, since they allow us to see where an alteration has occurred. Oldenberg  (1888:  193–94) provides the following example. In a series of single hymns with  decreasing numbers of verses, V.83 is a hymn to Parjanya of ten verses and V.85 is a  hymn to Varuṇa of eight verses. Between the two is V.84, a hymn to Earth of three  verses. Clearly the hymn to Earth is out of sequence and was likely inserted between  the hymns to Parjanya and to Varuṇa.+++(5)+++ While the fact of its insertion is obvious,  there are several possible explanations for how and why this occurred. For example,  V.84 could be a later composition that was later added to the R̥gveda, or it could  have been composed earlier but have been moved to its current place within the  collection. In either case, this little hymn is actually a riddle depicting Earth during  a violent storm and must have been felt as an appropriate pendant to the Parjanya  hymn (see Jamison 2013).</p>
<h2 id="ii-history-of-the-rgvedic-text">II. History of the R̥gvedic Text</h2>
<h3 id="a-language-and-compositional-technique">A. Language and Compositional Technique</h3>
<p>The R̥gveda was composed in an archaic form of Sanskrit that is richer in forms  and less grammatically fixed than Classical Sanskrit, but essentially identical in  structure. For further discussion of the language, see section VII below. The text was composed entirely orally and transmitted entirely orally for a very long time,  probably several millennia. But it was a type of oral composition very different  from what that designation now generally brings to mind in scholarly, especially  Homeric, circles. It was not an anonymous floating body of infinitely variable verbal material (re-)composed anew at every performance, generated in great part from  fixed formulae that formed the poet’s repertoire.+++(4)+++ In contrast to the vast sprawl of  epic, on which the usual model of oral-formulaic composition was formed and  tested, R̥gvedic oral composition was small-scale and verbally complex. Though  orally composed and making use of traditional verbal material, each hymn was  composed by a particular poet, who fixed the hymn at the time of composition and  who “owned” it, and it was transmitted in this fixed form thereafter.</p>
<p>R̥gvedic verbal formulae work very differently from those in epic composition. Rather than deploying fairly sizable, metrically defined, and invariant  pieces—ready-made surface structures, in the felicitous phrase of Paul Kiparsky  (1976: 83)—our poets seem to operate with deep-structure formulae. Invariant repetition is fairly rare, and when it occurs, the repeated formulae tend to be short, gen erally shorter than the pāda (= verse line) and not necessarily metrically fixed. But  the poets often assume knowledge of an underlying formula, which seldom or never  surfaces as such, but which they ring changes on—by lexical or grammatical substitution, scrambling, semantic reversal, and the like, confounding the expectations of  their audience while drawing upon their shared knowledge of the underlying verbal  expression. These deep-structure formulae tend to be shared across bardic families,  and we can in fact sometimes identify cognate formulae in other Indo-European  poetic traditions, especially in the Old Avestan Gāthās.</p>
<h3 id="b-preservation-and-transmission">B. Preservation and Transmission</h3>
<p>The structure of the R̥gveda points to several stages in the creation of the R̥gvedic  text as we now have it. Collections of hymns were first made by the families of poets  who produced them, and these early collections defined the various poetic tradi tions and helped train new poets within those traditions. At some point a unified  consolidation was made of six family traditions, which formed the original collec tion of the Family Books, II–VII. As discussed above, the books were arranged  from shortest to longest and the hymns of each book were organized according to  the same principles. Then, probably at several intervals, the hymns of books I and  VIII (except for the Vālakhilya hymns) were added+++(4)+++, and book IX was assembled  from hymns composed by poets of the other books of the R̥gveda and from hymns  of younger poets. The last major additions to the collection were the hymns of  book X.</p>
<p>We do not know the precise mechanism for the formation of the R̥gvedic collection or the circumstances that brought it about. There must have been some centralized authority or agency that could consolidate the different family traditions  and impose a single set of organizational principles on their collections. Michael Witzel (cf. 1995a, 1995b, 1997, 2003)  has suggested that this authority was first  the Bharata tribe, as it attained hegemony over the other Vedic tribes during the  R̥gvedic period, and then later the Kuru state, which arose around 1000 bce. In  his view, the initial collection and organization of the Family Books, the Kāṇva  hymns of VIII, and the nine collections of I.51–191 occurred under the Bharatas,  and the complete collection of the R̥gveda under the Kurus. These consolidations  of the religious traditions supported the political consolidations of the Bharatas  and of the Kurus and reinforced their rule by means of a unified religious practice  approximating a state religion. The Kuru period saw the creation not only of the  complete R̥gveda but also of the other saṃhitās, and the fixation and canonization  of Vedic sacrifices. The Vedic rites created at this time were composites, fashioned  from different family traditions. They included extended recitations constituted of  verses extracted from various parts of the R̥gveda and thus from various family  traditions. The purpose of such composite rites was to create a ritual system that  represented the unity of the Vedic tradition. This process is already apparent in late  hymns of the R̥gveda itself (cf. Proferes 2003a). For example, R̥V IX.67 is a hymn  to “self-purifying” soma. Rather than being the product of a particular poet or even  a particular family of poets, it includes verses from poets representing the principal brahmin lineages. It reflects an attempt to create an “ecumenical” liturgy, as  Proferes (2003a: 8) calls it, one in which all the major poetic traditions had a place.</p>
<p>The creation of the R̥gvedic Saṃhitā reflected a significant ritual change, since it  marked an emphasis on liturgical appropriation and repetition of earlier material  rather than, as in the R̥gvedic period itself, on the creation of new hymns. However,  the tradition of R̥gvedic composition did not simply come to a halt at the close of  the R̥gvedic period. The R̥gveda Khila (Scheftelowitz 1906) is a collection of hymns  that do not form part of the Śākalya recension. Some of these hymns may go back  to the R̥gvedic period, but most were likely composed in the following period, during which the hymns, chants, and recitations of the Atharvaveda, the Sāmaveda,  and the Yajurveda were composed or assembled. The Atharvaveda itself also rep resents the extension of hymnic composition into a wider variety of ritual contexts,  a process already visible in R̥gveda book X. Beyond the Veda, elements and techniques typical of R̥gvedic composition appear in later praśastis, epic poetry, and  even in kāvya (see Jamison 2007: chap. 4).</p>
<p>The R̥gveda did not remain unchanged after its collection. As described above,  the collection of hymns was arranged according to definable principles, but the  text of the R̥gveda we have does not always follow these principles. Most of the  changes were made at an early period since they are reflected in all the versions  of the R̥gveda that we have or that are described in later literature. These versions  were the product of Vedic schools or śākhās, which became the institutions through  which the R̥gveda collection was preserved and transmitted.</p>
<p>The R̥gveda translated here is the R̥gveda of the Śākala school, established by  Śākalya, a teacher of the late Vedic period. There were other schools that produced  other recensions of the R̥gveda, although most of these other recensions are now lost. The Caraṇavyūha, a Yajurvedic Pariśiṣṭa, lists five R̥gvedic schools: Śākala,  Bāṣkala, Āśvalāyana, Śāṅkhāyana, and Māṇḍūkāyana. Other sources give larger  numbers of R̥gvedic schools. There are seven according to the Atharvaveda  Pariśiṣṭa, and twenty-one according to Patañjali (ca. 150 bce), although the last  number reflects not the number of versions of the R̥gveda, but rather of schools  that studied the R̥gveda. Of the five recensions mentioned in the Caraṇavyūha, the  oldest may be the Māṇḍūkāyana, although little is known about it. The Bāṣkala  school may have survived into the sixteenth century (Chaubey 2009: vii), and perhaps the Bāṣkala R̥gveda still exists somewhere in manuscript. But even without a  manuscript, much is known about it from other texts. It probably dates to around  the time of the Śākala recension and was close to the Śākala recension in substance. According to the Anuvākānukramaṇī, the Bāṣkala R̥gveda included the first  seven hymns of the Vālakhilya, but rejected the other four, and after R̥V X.191,  the last hymn in the Śākala recension, it had a second saṃjñāna hymn, or hymn of  “agreement,” consisting of fifteen verses. It also rearranged Maṇḍala I, so that the  Kutsa collection (I.94–115) followed the Parucchepa collection (I.127–139).+++(5)+++ This  rearrangement conforms better to the expected order of the collections that constitute Maṇḍala I and therefore may represent either an older tradition than that of  the Śākala recension or a later correction made according to perceived principles.</p>
<p>The Āśvalāyana R̥gveda has recently been published (Chaubey 2009). It was based  on the Śākala recension, but includes an additional 212 verses, all of which are  later than the rest of the R̥gveda. The Śāṅkhāyana R̥gveda was very similar to the  Āśvalāyana R̥gveda. A sixth R̥gvedic school was the Śaiśirīya school, mentioned in  the R̥gveda Prātiśākhya. Its recension again closely resembled the Śākala recension  and indeed the Śaiśirīya school might have derived from the Śākala school or have  been merged with it (cf. Bronkhorst 1982/83). It again contained a few more verses  than does the Śākala recension. In short, the differences among the reported and  attested recensions of the R̥gveda are very minor, consisting of variant ordering of  some existing materials and the inclusion or not of a relatively few late verses. There  seems no need to mourn the loss of these recensions.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>These schools produced a saṃhitā text, that is, a continuous text of the R̥gveda  that includes the phonological alterations that occur between words— a phenomenon characteristic of the Sanskrit language in general known as sandhi or “putting  together.” It is this basic form of the hymns that would have been recited in their  ritual contexts. But in order to secure the text, these schools also produced other  forms of the R̥gveda that supported its memorization. According to Patañjali,  Śākalya not only created a recension of the saṃhitā text, but also a padapāṭha text.  This latter text provides a grammatical analysis of the words of the R̥gveda by  restoring the forms of the words before the application of the sandhi rules when  the words are strung together. It shows the schools’ interest not only in preserving  and transmitting the R̥gveda, but also in understanding the text they transmitted.</p>
<p>This history gives us reason to be confident that the Śākala R̥gveda is close to  the R̥gveda that was created at the beginning of the first millennium, even though the Śākala recension probably dates to some five hundred years later. We also  have evidence for minor changes in the Śākala text itself. In the Śākala Padapāṭha,  there is no analysis for six verses in the Saṃhitā: VII.59.12, X.20.1, 121.10, 190.1– 3. They are probably missing from Padapāṭha analysis because they were not  part of the text of the R̥gveda at the time of the creation of the Padapāṭha, but  were added to the Śākala text at a later period.+++(5)+++ Note again that these adjustments primarily occur in book X, the latest part of the R̥gveda and apparently  its most fluid.</p>
<p>When we say that the Śākala R̥gveda is substantially the text created at the  beginning of the first millennium bce, we need to acknowledge one significant  area in which the R̥gveda recensions show demonstrable change since the collection of the R̥gveda. This is in the phonetics of the text. The recitation of the  R̥gveda in different regions and times apparently reflected the different contemporary dialects and conventions of recitation in those regions and times. Such  change is apparent in the Śākala recension in its handling of the phonological  alterations that take place between words. The Śākala school imposed a further  set of euphonic or sandhi rules on the text that developed during the centuries  between the composition of the text and the Śākala recension. The result is that  the saṃhitā text does not always reflect the metrical structure of the verses.+++(5)+++ In  most cases, the changes are sufficiently regular that it is not difficult to restore the  text to its metrical shape. For example, in the saṃhitā text the last verse of the  first hymn of the R̥gveda reads: I.1.9 sá naḥ pitéva sūnávé, ’gne sūpāyanó bhava /  sácasvā naḥ svastáye. This hymn is composed in gāyatrī meter, so it ought to have  eight syllables in each pāda. But the elision at the beginning of pāda b gives a line  of seven syllables, and pāda c also apparently has seven syllables. Originally, the  verse must have been recited without the elision in b: sá naḥ pitéva sūnáve, ágne  sūpāyanó bhava. And in pāda c svastáye must have been recited quadra-syllabically su(v)astáye. While it is usually not difficult to restore the meter, that work  has been done for us in the edition of the R̥gveda by Barend A. van Nooten and  Gary B. Holland (1994), which gives the metrically restored text of the Śākala  recension.</p>
<p>These kinds of phonetic and euphonic changes were natural in the oral transmission of the text, more natural than the rigid oral preservation of the text after  the Vedic period. Because such changes are natural, they were likely not deliberate alterations. More importantly, the reciters of the R̥gveda did not deliberately  change and, for the most part, did not change at all the order of the books of the  R̥gveda, the order of verses within hymns, the words of the hymns, or their grammar.  There were a few—but relatively few—changes to the order of hymns, such as that  reflected in the difference between the Bāṣkala and Śākala recensions in the order  of Maṇḍala I. This early “freezing” of the text is very important and one of the  characteristics that makes the R̥gveda so valuable for understanding the linguistic,  religious, and literary history of South Asia. The R̥gvedic tradition has preserved  a very ancient literature with extraordinary fidelity, with no grammatical or lexical modernization or adjustment of contents to later conceptual conditions.</p>
<p>It could  have been otherwise. In R̥gvedic hymns that also appear in the Atharvaveda, the  latter text not uncommonly shows a different verse order, and in both Atharvavedic  and Sāmavedic versions of R̥gvedic hymns there can be differences in wording and  in grammatical forms. In these cases, with few if any exceptions, the R̥gvedic version of the hymn is the older, and the versions of the other Vedas are modifications.+++(5)+++ Up to the creation of the recensions of the R̥gveda and long afterward, the  transmission of the R̥gveda was oral. At some point, however, the R̥gvedic schools  did produce manuscripts of the text. It is difficult to say when this occurred, but the  transmission of the text likely remained exclusively oral at least until around 1000  ce. The oldest manuscript in the collection of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research  Institute collection dates only to 1464; the Sampurnanand Sanskrit University in  Varanasi has an older R̥gveda manuscript from the fourteenth century—thus a gap  of considerably over two millennia between the fixation of the text and our earliest  written evidence for it. Even when these activities did begin to occur, copying and  preserving manuscripts never displaced memorization of the text as the primary  means of transmission of the R̥gveda until quite modern times.</p>
<h3 id="c-indigenous-commentarial-tradition">C. Indigenous Commentarial Tradition</h3>
<p>With regard to indigenous commentary, the situation of the R̥gveda differs markedly from that of standard Classical Sanskrit texts, in that there is no unbroken  commentarial tradition that might preserve the understanding of the text by the  authors and audience at the time of composition. Although we find implicit commentary on some parts of the R̥gveda already in later Vedic texts, it is clear that in  many case this “commentary” is based more on adaptation, speculation, or fancy  than on a direct transmission of the purport of the text, as when the Śatapatha  Brāhmaṇa (XI.5.1) sketches a narrative background for the Purūravas and Urvaśī dialogue (R̥V X.95) that distorts or misunderstands crucial portions of the hymn.+++(5)+++ The first complete de facto commentary on the R̥gveda, dating probably from  the late Vedic period, is Śākalya’s Padapāṭha mentioned above, which simply consists of an effectively linguistic analysis of the continuous text (the Saṃhitāpāṭha)  of the R̥gveda into individual words (padas). Because of sandhi, an important and  pervasive feature of the Sanskrit language whereby all words undergo significant  phonological adjustment to adjacent words in context, the phonological restora tion of the underlying pausal forms of words from the continuous reading is no mere mechanical operation, but presupposes a grammatical and semantic analysis  of the text.</p>
<p>The Nighaṇṭu is a collection of difficult Vedic words probably made likewise  in the late Vedic period. The Nighaṇṭu and the commentary upon this collection  by Yāska in his Nirukta provide early lexical and etymological approaches to the  R̥gveda, though understanding “etymology” in a synchronic+++(??)+++, rather than our current diachronic sense.</p>
<p>Various indexes or anukramaṇīs to the R̥gveda, also mentioned above, were compiled probably around the middle of the first millennium bce, attributed to Śaunaka;  these were not fully preserved. A comprehensive index, the Sarvānukramaṇī, attrib uted to Kātyāyana and dating perhaps to the mid-fourth century bce but drawing  on the earlier indexes, provides, for each hymn, the poet, the god(s) to which it is  addressed, and the meter(s) in which it is composed. The Br̥haddevatā, also attributed to Śaunaka, is in essence also an anukramaṇī, specifically an index to the deities of each hymn, but in expanded form, with a number of interesting narratives  and legends interspersed in the dry sequential listing of hymns and their divinities.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>None of these ancient tools and treatments remotely approaches the standard  type of commentary familiar for later Sanskrit texts. For this the R̥gveda had to  wait until the medieval period. The most influential and lasting commentary on the  text was made by Sāyaṇa in the fourteenth century ce in South India, although there  were a number of pre-Sāyaṇa commentators, some of whose work survives in part.  Sāyaṇa’s work essentially superseded these earlier works, and remains enormously  important in both indigenous and Western interpretations of the text: Max Müller’s  edition of the R̥gveda includes Sāyaṇa’s commentary, and Geldner’s translation, for  example, owes much to Sāyaṇa.+++(4)+++ It should be remembered, however, that Sāyaṇa is  temporally closer to our own age than to that of the R̥gveda, and he was writing  in a very different geographical, political, and religious landscape from that of the  R̥gveda. It is therefore more useful to read Sāyaṇa not as a direct conduit of the  “true meaning” of the R̥gveda but as a scholar grappling with the same problems  as modern interpreters, and bringing to bear all the intelligence and knowledge he  can muster, just as we do.+++(5)+++</p>
<h3 id="d-western-scholarship-on-the-rgveda-and-major-resources">D. Western Scholarship on the R̥gveda and Major Resources</h3>
<p>Because the transmission of the R̥gveda has preserved the text remarkably well, we  have a trustworthy and uniform text of the R̥gveda. The published editions of the  R̥gveda differ in their presentation of the text, not in the text itself. The landmark  edition of the R̥gveda was that of Max Müller (1849–74), who published both the  Saṃhitā and Padapāṭha text in devanāgarī script, together with Sāyaṇa’s commentary. Before the completion of Müller’s R̥gveda, in 1861–63 Theodor Aufrecht published the text in Roman transliteration, together with selected Padapāṭha analyses.  A  second edition, the standard edition of Aufrecht’s R̥gveda, appeared in 1877.  The R̥gveda and Sāyaṇa’s commentary were published again under the editorship  of N. S. Sontakke (1933–51), together with the Padapāṭha. Also noteworthy is the  aforementioned publication of the metrically restored version of the R̥gveda text by  Barend A. van Nooten and Gary B. Holland (1994).+++(4)+++</p>
<p>The uniformity and reliability of the text of the R̥gveda cannot be said of its  translations, which vary considerably. The standard scholarly translation remains  that of Karl Friedrich Geldner into German. This translation was published in full in 1951, but was complete in the 1920s and partially published in limited fashion  then. Although it remains a remarkable philological accomplishment, whose worth  we two translators have appreciated more and more over the years, it of course  could not take account of the advances in Vedic scholarship over the last eighty  years or so. Louis Renou (1955–69) was able to finish most of a French translation  of the R̥gveda, in a series of thematic publications, under the general title Études  védiques et pāṇinéennes, organized by the divinity addressed rather than the order  of the R̥gvedic text. But he left undone substantial parts, notably the Indra and  Aśvin hymns, and the later publications are rather sketchy. T.  Ya. Elizarenkova  (1989–99) completed a Russian translation of the text. Currently in preparation is a  new German translation of the R̥gveda under the direction of Michael Witzel and  Toshifumi Gotō. The first volume of the Witzel-Gotō translation (2007), which covers Maṇḍalas I and II, has appeared, with the second volume scheduled for 2013.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, English has not been as well served as these other languages.  Aside from anthologies, the English version that is in general use is R. T. H. Griffith’s  translation, which was first published in four volumes between 1889 and 1892, then  in a revised edition in 1896, and then yet again in another revised edition, this time  by J. L. Shastri, in 1973. Griffith’s translation has been reprinted several times since  1973 and is available online (<a href="http://www.sacred">http://www.sacred</a>- texts.com/hin/rigveda/index.htm).  Sadly, this translation really does not deserve as many rebirths as it has had. Its philology was already dated when it was published, and the English style of the translation is cloying and almost unreadable. Now, well over a century later, it should have  long since been superseded. There was at least one serious effort to do so. From the  late 1940s until the early 1960s, H. D. Velankar steadily published English translations of the R̥gveda, which were a decided improvement over Griffith’s work (for a  list of his translations, see the Bibliography). These were published as independent  volumes dedicated to books II, V, VII, and VIII of the R̥gveda and as collections  of hymns to different deities published in the Journal of the University of Bombay.  Partly because these translations are scattered, incomplete, and difficult of access,  they have received less attention than they might otherwise have done. In addition  to these complete or extensive translations of the R̥gveda, several anthologies of  R̥gvedic hymns have appeared. In English, the most notable are those of Wendy  Doniger O’Flaherty (1981) and Walter H. Maurer (1986). The principal problem  with any such anthology is that translators understandably choose hymns that they  think will be especially interesting for their readers and accessible to them. As a  result, they tend to create a distorted view of the R̥gveda that does not reflect the  liturgical functions and scope of the text.</p>
<p>Both the partial and the complete translations just mentioned were fundamental  for the present translation. In our introductions to individual hymns, we will often  make reference to them, especially when they suggest interpretations of the text we  deem particularly worthy of note. Rather than giving a fuller bibliographic reference, we will refer to them only by the last names of the translators. The exceptions  are Renou’s translations, for which we will give the relevant volume and page of his Études védiques et pāṇinéenes, and Velankar’s translations, where again we will cite  the specific source.</p>
<p>In addition to these translations, there are a number of other essential resources  for translating and interpreting the R̥gveda. Among the older works of particular  significance are the Wörterbuch of Hermann Grassmann (1872–75), whose pre sentation of the lexicon of the R̥gveda is somewhat antique but still very useful.  Grassmann’s work has now been complemented and in some respects superseded  by Alexander Lubotsky’s concordance to the R̥gveda (1997), which provides the  verse-line context for R̥gvedic words. Among older works of significance, of par ticular note is Hermann Oldenberg’s Noten (1909, 1912) on the complete text of  the R̥gveda, whose insights remain remarkable even a century after they were pub lished. Maurice Bloomfield’s Rig-veda Repetitions (1916) is an invaluable resource  for the study of R̥gvedic formulaic language and its variations, though it predates  the discovery of oral-formulaic composition.</p>
<p>In the last fifty years or so, R̥gvedic scholarship has blossomed with studies that  have significantly advanced our understanding of the language of the R̥gveda—its  lexicon, morphology, and syntax—of its compositional techniques, and of its con ceptual universe and ritual procedures and context. We cannot offer even a partial  list of such books, let alone articles, since we would omit too many. We will mention  only a few, those which were especially close at hand as we worked through the text  and whose insights we have often adopted. Particularly important was Manfred  Mayrhofer’s etymological dictionary of Old Indo-Aryan (EWA 1986–2001) and his  previous version (KEWA 1951–76), not completely superseded by the newer one.+++(5)+++  Other works include Salvatore Scarlata’s study of nominal compounds ending in  roots (1999) and Jared S. Klein’s studies of Vedic particles and discourse structure  (1985). One of the subjects in which there has been substantial progress just in the  last decades has been the Vedic verbal system. The flood of monographs on the verbal system probably began with Johanna Narten’s work on the s-aorist (1964), followed closely by Karl Hoffmann’s influential study of the injunctive (1967). Other  verbal subsystems treated more recently include the -áya-stems (Jamison 1983), the  first-class presents (Gotō 1987), the intensive (Schaefer 1994), the perfect (Kümmel  2000), the desiderative (Heenen 2006), and the ya-presents (Kulikov 2012). All of  these works, as well as many other and many shorter studies, have been of critical  importance as we have worked our way through the text.</p>
<p>Finally, we wish to note one last development not just in R̥gvedic but in Sanskrit  scholarship more generally. Among older scholars there was a tendency to deal  with difficulties in a text by emending it. By the beginning of the twentieth century,  however, scholars increasingly recognized that they could gain a much better understanding of the text by accepting the text as transmitted. This process is visible in  Oldenberg’s scholarship. Before the Noten, Oldenberg published translations of the  Agni hymns of the first five books of the R̥gveda (1897). There he was willing to  suggest text emendations to smooth rough spots in the hymns. By the time of the  Noten, however, he had become much more apt to accept the text as it stands and to explore ways of accounting for that transmitted text. We too are committed to  accepting the traditional text and more importantly to allowing the poetry of the  R̥gveda to remain complex, elusive, jagged, unsettled, and even unsettling.</p>
<h2 id="iii-power-of-the-word">III. Power of the Word</h2>
<h3 id="a-words-truth-and-knowledge">A. Words, Truth, and Knowledge</h3>
<p>One reason for the intricacy of R̥gvedic poetry and the careful thought that the  R̥gvedic poets put into it is the importance that Vedic culture attached to the spo ken word and to the truth that it embodied. The elegantly formulated truth, spoken  in a ritual context, was powerful. The word for “truth” is r̥tá, a crucially resonant  word that, with some reason, some other translators have rendered “order” or “cosmic order.” The term r̥tá essentially defines what a being or object is and what it  does, and it structures the relationships of beings and objects with other beings and  objects. By speaking these truths of essence and relationship, the poets could make  the truths real and actual in the present. So, for example, the great Indra hymn,  I.32, begins, “Now I shall proclaim the heroic deeds of Indra, those foremost deeds,  which the mace-wielder performed&hellip;.” Why does the poet proclaim these deeds?  It is not simply to honor the god, although his proclamation surely does do that. It  is also to state the truth of these heroic deeds, so that these deeds will become real  once again. As Indra once before smashed Vr̥tra, who was the symbol and epitome  of all obstacles, so once again he will smash obstacles. Formulating the “truth” of  Indra is part of what makes Indra real and present. Similarly, the story of Indra  and the Vala cave is essentially a story of the power of the truth. According to  this myth, Indra and the Aṅgirases opened the Vala cave and released the cattle  and the dawns by the songs they recited. These songs were powerful because they  contained the truth that the cattle were the dawns, and therefore, by singing this  truth Indra and the Aṅgirases obtained both cattle and dawns.+++(5)+++ In X.108 the poet  narrates part of the story of Indra and Vala and then states his expectation that  the truth of his song, which is the truth of the Vala story, will bring cattle back to  him: “Exchanging with the truth, let the cows come up, which Br̥haspati [=Indra]  found hidden&hellip;.” Or again, in IX.113.2 the poet declares the soma is pressed “with  real words of truth, with trust, and with fervor.” That is to say, it is not just the  physical pressing of the soma plant that produces soma juice. Soma is also created by the intensity of the priests, by their confidence in the effectiveness of their  actions, and by the truth they speak about the soma and about the power of the  soma to strengthen the gods and to give life to mortals. Words, commitment, and  ritual all combine to make the soma real.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>The product of the formulating of a truth, the verbal formulation itself, is the  bráhman, and the poet who formulates truth is the brahmán.+++(5)+++ While the later ritual  tradition will rely on ancient formulations of the truth passed down from the early Vedic period, the contemporary religious system of the R̥gveda required ever-new  formulations of the truth. These new formulations would attract the gods and make  them present at the ritual, and these new formulations would make the truth they  expressed newly real. For this reason the work of the poet was essential, for only  poets could continue to produce these new formulations. The poet needed to be a  master of many skills, but of all the skills he needed, the one that was most essential was knowledge. The truths that the poets formulated were often hidden truths,  founded on enigma and paradox. One such kind of truth was homological truth  that connected objects across spheres, which will be discussed in the next section.</p>
<p>The importance of knowledge for the Vedic poets is underscored by the variety  of words for the poets’ thinking and its articulation in the hymns. The poets speak  of their dhī́ or dhītí “insight” or “vision,” matí or mánman “thought,” and manīṣā́ “inspired thinking.” The hymn and the understanding that gives rise to it are so  closely related that the boundary between them becomes permeable, and the poets  use words for thinking and knowing for the hymns themselves.+++(4)+++ In I.2.7, for example,  the poet calls on Mitra and Varuṇa “who bring success to our ghee-covered insight  (dhíyaṃ ghr̥tā́cīm),” that is, to the hymn that is accompanied by offerings of ghee, or  again, in VI.8.1 the poet offers Agni Vaiśvānara a “newer thought” (matír návyasī),  which purifies itself (pavate) in the poet’s mind and emerges in his speech.</p>
<h3 id="b-homology">B. Homology</h3>
<p>The Vedic mental universe is structured, in great part, by a web of identifications  or equivalences among elements in the ritual realm, in the cosmic realm, and in the  realm of the everyday. These homologies play an enormous role in the thought of  the Brāhmaṇas and Upaniṣads, where knowing the hidden connections between  apparently disparate elements, particularly the equivalences between cosmic and  ritual elements, gives the knower some power to control the cosmic by manipulation  of the ritual.+++(5)+++ In these later Vedic texts, such types of equivalences have a technical  name—bandhu “bond, connection” (a word of course cognate with English “bind,”  etc.)—and the difference between the cosmic and the mundane system of equations  is pervasive enough to be distinguished by technical terms+++(5)+++: the cosmic level is called  adhidaivam or adhidevatam, roughly “concerned with the divine,” while the mundane is called adhyātmam, roughly “concerned with the person(al).” These two systems meet in and focus on the sacrifice, a controlled and orderly sphere of human  activity, as a way of modeling the complex web of relationships that obtain in the  two other realms, which are not under human control. The level of the sacrifice is  called adhiyajñam “relating to the sacrifice.”</p>
<p>Although the correspondences are not as systematically worked out and presented in the R̥gveda as in those later texts, this way of thinking is just as pervasive  in that text, though backgrounded:  the poets assume that they share with their  audience a web of associations, and this shared knowledge allows the poet to sub stitute one element for another without overt signaling. Thus, for example, the first rays of light at dawn are homologized to cows+++(4)+++, as in the Vala myth discussed above,  and therefore the goddess Dawn is called “the mother of cows” and images of  ruddy cows overrun the hymns to Dawn. Cows also have a ritual association: milk  is mixed with the soma juice after it is pressed, and so the soma hymns are filled  with depictions of the soma (as bull) running toward or mixing with “the cows,”  that is, the milk.+++(5)+++ And cows are also homologized to waters, particularly the waters  confined by Vr̥tra and released by Indra’s killing of that demon.</p>
<p>Modern readers of the R̥gveda must try to internalize the many associations and  identifications that formed the unconscious mental universe of the contemporary  audience; otherwise almost every hymn in many of its parts will seem unintelligible  or nonsensical. Other important homologies include that between the sun and the  fire, especially the ritual fire, and, in general, the many associations between the  various parts and procedures of the ritual and both cosmic and everyday elements.  For example, the ritual itself, or the praise hymn specifically, is often identified with  a chariot, and the crafting of poetry is homologized to chariot-making.+++(4)+++ Soma is  often identified with a bull, but often otherwise with a horse, and the ritual preparation of the soma is equated with the grooming of this horse.+++(4)+++ Or he is a bird settling  into his nest or a king embarking on conquest.+++(4)+++ The ritual ground itself is often identified with the cosmos, with the ritual fire a pillar connecting heaven and earth and  any movement on the ritual ground implicitly compared to a vast journey across  or around the cosmos.+++(4)+++ It is not possible here to list anything approaching all the  important connections that underlie R̥gvedic poetry, though we will try to sketch  many such associations in particular circumstances. But the reader must be alert  to, and open to, this overall substitution principle, and also recognize that these  homologies are not mere poetic embellishments, imagery for its own sake, but an  implicit statement about the way things really are, the pervasive underlying connections unifying apparently disparate elements.</p>
<p>It is one of the poet’s main jobs to find and articulate these hidden connections,  and the theme of “secret names” and their discovery is an important one in the  R̥gveda. Indeed, one of the great deeds attributed to Indra (as Br̥haspati) and to the  poet-singers, the Aṅgirases, divine counterparts of the human poet—the splitting  of the Vala cave and the release of the cows imprisoned therein — turns in some  versions on discovering the cows’ hidden names (e.g., IV.1.16, X.68.7). The training  of a poet clearly involved both producing and solving quite recherché associations,  and the genre of riddle displays these skills to great advantage.</p>
<h3 id="c-the-wordsmiths">C. The Wordsmiths</h3>
<p>A number of different words are used to identify the workers in words, for which  we use the cover term “poet.” These different terms often in fact have the same  referent, sometimes in the very same passage, but emphasize different aspects of  verbal craftsmanship. The most important terms are brahmán, kaví, ŕ̥ṣi, and vípra.  Although it is not always possible to draw fine distinctions among these words, and there remains considerable disagreement about their application (we two translators, for example, are not entirely agreed on the function of the kaví), the words do  point to different types of relationships between the poet and his product and its  source. As noted above, the brahmán is the “formulator,” who discerns and puts into  words the hidden truths that undergird reality. His product is a bráhman, a “sacred  formulation.” The term ŕ̥ṣi, generally rendered here as “seer,” is especially applied  to the famous seers of the past, single or as a group, and to current poets who consciously aspire to the status of their predecessors, and like other words for verbal  craftsmen, it is also regularly used of gods, especially Agni and Soma. The vípra, a  derivative of the root √vip “tremble,”+++(5)+++ appears to be an “inspired poet” and contrasts  with the kaví, the poet par excellence, but also the “sage poet,” endowed with the  knowledge embodied in poetic skill (kā́vya). The original sense of the word kaví and the function of the person so named is disputed; it has well-attested Iranian  cognates, starting with Avestan kauui, whose sense diverges from its Vedic corre spondent. We two translators have discussed these issues in separate treatments  (Brereton 2004; Jamison 2007: chap. 4).</p>
<p>There are a few less well-attested terms, such as kārú here rendered “bard” or  “praise-poet,” the transparent agent noun stotár “praiser,” as well as designations  that seem more related to performance, such as jaritár “singer,” vāghát “cantor” or  “chanter,” rebhá “husky-/raspy-voiced (singer).”</p>
<h2 id="iv-ritual">IV. Ritual</h2>
<p>There have been a variety of approaches to the R̥gveda, by both ancient and modern scholars. Following the lead of the Br̥haddevatā, some interpreters have been  concerned primarily with the myths and legends of the R̥gveda. Others have sought  to understand the deities of the R̥gveda by exploring the meaning and derivation  of their names. And as early as the later Vedic period, still others understood the  R̥gvedic deities as the powers of the natural world or as symbols of microcosmic  processes. But the R̥gveda is first of all a liturgical text. The great majority of its  hymns were composed for rituals and, more specifically, for the soma rituals of  their period. After the collection of the R̥gveda, its verses were adapted to the recitations and chants of the classical soma ritual and employed in a variety of other  ritual contexts. Understanding the R̥gveda, therefore, first requires understanding  the Vedic rituals and, above all, the soma ritual.</p>
<h3 id="a-model-of-the-ritual">A. Model of the Ritual</h3>
<p>The ritual as depicted both in the R̥gveda and in the later Vedic texts treating the  classical śrauta system (and indeed the much later pūjā of classical Hinduism) is  modeled as a hospitality ceremony and festive meal, offered to the visiting gods. The  poets eagerly invite the gods to journey to attend the sacrifice. When they arrive, they are greeted and provided with seats near the center of the action, on a special  grass strewn on the ritual ground to make the ground more comfortable. This grass  strew is called barhís and it has an exact cognate in Avestan barziš “cushion, pillow.”+++(4)+++  In some hymns the horses pulling the gods’ chariots, particularly Indra’s two fallow+++(=yellowish-brown)+++  bays+++(=reddish brown horse)+++, are unhitched and offered refreshment of their own. The gods are then offered  a meal, that is, the oblations, generally consisting of ghee, little grain cakes, and,  in the most important sacrifices, soma, and they are entertained while they eat, by  the hymns of praise that constitute the R̥gvedic corpus.+++(4)+++ The end of this entertain ment is often announced in the final verse of the hymn, and sometimes the gods are  explicitly sent on their way back to heaven. Particularly nice examples of this envoi+++(=concluding poem)+++  are found in I.61–63 and I.82, hymns designed to accompany the Hāriyojana or  “Fallow-bay-yoking” oblation, the ritualized hitching up of Indra’s horses for the  return journey; in I.82.5–6 Indra is charmingly urged to go home to his “dear wife.”</p>
<p>The “ritual ground” alluded to above is the sacralized space within which the ritual proceeds. It is not a permanent space dedicated to ritual performance, much less  a building or temple; rather, judging from the evidence of the later śrauta texts, it is  demarcated and sacralized for each performance. The space is defined especially by  the presence of three ritual fires, the focal point of the sacrifice and the recipient(s)  of the oblations. In the later texts these are the Āhavanīya (the fire “to be offered  into”) set to the east, the Gārhapatya (“householders’ fire”) to the west, from which  the Āhavanīya is taken out and carried to the east, and the Dakṣiṇāgni (“southern  fire”), and their locations and functions are precisely fixed. The R̥gveda does not  attest these names for the fires, but it does often refer, though often obliquely, to  the three fires of the ritual. Moreover, the god Agni and his physical representative,  the offering fire, regularly receive the epithet puróhita “placed to the east/in front,”  appropriate to the removal of the Āhavanīya fire from the western Gārhapatya  and its movement to the east. (The third word in the R̥gveda is in fact puróhitam I.1.1.) The poets sometimes seem to treat this movement as a sacred mystery (e.g.,  III.31.1–3), a fact that may point to the three-fire model as a ritual innovation of  the pre-R̥gvedic period. There is no parallel to it in Avestan ritual, which uses only  a single fire.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>One aspect of the “entertainment of guests” model of Vedic sacrifice is the fear,  constantly expressed, that the gods will choose to go to another party. The R̥gvedic  sacrificers know that everyone in the larger sacrificial community follows much the  same ritual calendar and therefore many competing sacrifices are taking place at  the same time.+++(5)+++ The invitation to the gods often explicitly urges them to pass over  other sacrifices and come to ours, and in order to make ours more attractive, we  must provide the best hospitality, in particular the best entertainment in the form  of exquisitely crafted and novel hymns.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>An important feature of the “guest” model is the fact that it envisions and  requires direct interaction between gods and mortals, on the mortals’ turf—or  rather on a space that has been rendered temporarily neutral through its sacralization— though it is on earth, the human realm, rather than in the gods’ world, heaven. The interaction in turn requires epiphany in the technical sense: the gods  must appear in person, as it were. The poets crave this epiphany and fear its failure  to materialize. It is especially Indra whose epiphany they anticipate, and the fear  that it may not happen also leads to the more general fear that Indra does not exist,  a possibility that is often put in the mouth of doubtful “others.”+++(5)+++</p>
<p>There is another, more recessive model of sacrifice perceptible in the R̥gveda,  especially in Agni hymns, whereby the offerings go to the gods in heaven, rather  than requiring the gods to come to earth to receive them.+++(5)+++ The libations ascend on  the smoke of the offering fire, an image conceptually close to the Homeric sacrifice.  There seems to be no conflict in the minds of the R̥gvedic ritualists between these  two models, and they are not exclusive to different groups of poets but can in fact  occur in the same hymn+++(5)+++; see, for example, the Agni hymn I.1, where the “guest”  model dominates, with the gods’ travel to the sacrifice explicit in verses 2 and 5, but  the oblation’s movement to the gods is alluded to in verse 4.</p>
<h3 id="b-basic-elements-of-the-ritual">B. Basic Elements of the Ritual</h3>
<h4 id="changes-in-classical-rites">Changes in classical rites</h4>
<p>Later Vedic texts give detailed descriptions of the soma rituals, which varied in  length and complexity. The problem for the interpretation of the R̥gveda is that  these classical rites were clearly not the same as the rites of the R̥gvedic period  itself. While the classical rites drew on R̥gvedic traditions, they did not simply continue them. In the R̥gvedic period these rituals were probably much more variable,  for even though their rituals were based on a shared inherited tradition, different  priestly families performed the rites differently. For example, in the classical one-day  soma rite, soma juice is pressed out of the soma plant and offered to various deities  in the morning, at midday, and in the evening. But the third or evening pressing  stands apart from the other two. While soma plants are freshly pressed in the morning and at midday, in the evening the soma is extracted from the already-mangled  soma stems left over from the earlier pressings. Not only the soma preparation but  also the overall character of the Third Pressing is different. It has a greater focus on  the sacrificer and his wife, the gods of the Third Pressing form a less coherent group  than those of the other pressings, and in general, the rites of the Third Pressing  have the appearance of an appendix.+++(5)+++ It is possible that some family traditions did  not have a Third Pressing and that, among those that did, the form of the Third  Pressing was more fluid. Or again, in the Midday Pressing of the classical soma  ritual, there are offerings to Indra alone and to Indra along with the Maruts. This  form may represent a compromise between family traditions that offered soma only  to Indra at this second pressing and those that also included the Maruts.+++(4)+++</p>
<h4 id="the-wife">The wife</h4>
<p>Variation in the rite also occurred over time. The R̥gvedic period itself extended  through several generations of poets and priests, and the rites evolved during this  period. In the classical soma ritual the sacrificer must be accompanied by his wife,  who has her own ritual responsibilities (see Jamison 1996a). But in the R̥gveda,  the wife of the sacrificer is very rarely alluded to and then almost exclusively in the younger parts of the text. Therefore the wife of the sacrificer may have been a  late addition to the soma ritual, and indeed the R̥gveda even offers evidence that  her introduction may have been controversial, with some ritualists defending and  others rejecting her presence in the rite (see Jamison 2011, forthcoming a, and forthcoming b). Ultimately, those who wished to include the sacrificer’s wife won the day,  for in the classical soma ritual her presence is required even if her ritual functions  are limited.</p>
<h4 id="innovation-to-memorization">Innovation to memorization</h4>
<p>The consolidation of the ritual tradition and the creation of the classical forms  of the soma rite probably occurred after 1000 bce, during the period in which the  other saṃhitās were compiled. The innovations effected by this consolidation not  only changed the form of the ritual, but also altered its very nature. Fundamental  to the R̥gvedic rite was the need for poets to create new formulations of the truth  in order to attract the attention of the gods, to make them present at the rite, and  to define their action. But in the later Vedic period, not only did the ritual offerings become increasingly standardized, so also did the ritual recitations and chants.  Novelty and innovation were no longer primary values, but instead were supplanted  by the ability to remember the old compositions.+++(5)+++ The compilation of the R̥gveda  reflects the need to preserve the poetry of the past in order to employ it within  the ritual, for in the later Veda power resided not in the new formulation but in  the ancient one. Or rather and more generally, power was understood as residing  in the ritual performance as a whole and with the priests who carried out the rite.  In later Vedic interpretation the ritual even came to exercise power over the gods  themselves. The ritual became less an invitation to the gods and more a manipulation of them.+++(4)+++ One marker of this shift was the rise in the later Veda of Prajāpati, the  Lord of Creatures. Prajāpati was the sacrifice itself, and his superiority to the other  gods therefore symbolized the dominance of the sacrifice over the gods.+++(5)+++ Knowledge  remained important: priests should understand the secrets of the rite that they per formed.+++(5)+++ But the knowledge and skills of a poet did not have a place in the evolving  ritual order.</p>
<p>Given the fluidity of the rites during the R̥gvedic era, we cannot really speak of  the R̥gvedic soma rite, even though there were certainly common characteristics of  the soma rituals performed throughout the period. Moreover, given the changes  that occurred after the R̥gvedic era, we cannot simply project the classical soma  rites back into the R̥gveda. While many technical ritual terms and elements were  passed down from the R̥gvedic period to the classical rites, these terms may not  have had the same significance for the R̥gveda that they do for the classical tradition. This is perhaps most obviously the case for the brahmán. In the later ritual the  brahmán became the formal overseer of the ritual. In the R̥gveda he was rather the  poet who formulates the truth (further see Brereton 2004).+++(4)+++</p>
<p>We have already noted that fire is at the center of the Vedic rites and that the  three fires of the classical śrauta ritual model were likely present in the R̥gvedic  ritual. It is clear that already in the R̥gveda the principal offerings were made into  the fire, and the gods received them through this mediating force. It is no wonder, then, that the first hymn of the R̥gveda is a hymn to Agni, the god of fire, since  his appearance ritually marked the beginning of the sacrifice, nor that Agni is the  recipient of more hymns than any god but Indra.</p>
<h4 id="priests">Priests</h4>
<p>Sacrifices were carried out by men performing a variety of priestly functions.  In II.1.2 and II.5.1–8 Gr̥tsamada poets provide a list of seven priests, to which the  Gr̥hapati “houselord,” who is the primary beneficiary of the rite, is added as an  eighth. Although the correspondence is not precise, Oldenberg (1917: 385) compares this list to a list of eight priests in the Avesta and argues that it reflects an  old tradition that was still alive in the R̥gveda. In II.1.2 these seven priests are the  Hotar, Potar, Neṣṭar, Agnīdh, Adhvaryu, Praśāstar, and Brahman. As Minkowski  (1991:  113)  points out, these seven essentially correspond to the classical list of  priests in the R̥tuyājas, the “sacrifices in turn” (which adds the Acchāvāka priest)  and in the R̥tvigvaraṇa, the “choosing of priests,” and to the priests who recite at  the Prasthitahomas, the “presented oblations.” It is likely, therefore, that the list of  seven does rest on a well-established tradition.</p>
<h5 id="hotar">Hotar</h5>
<p>The Hotar was the principal priest, and the R̥gveda repeatedly mentions the  “seven Hotars” (VIII.60.16; IX.10.7, 114.3; X.35.10, 61.1, 63.7) or the seven hótrāḥ “priestly functions” (X.17.11), by which it probably refers to the group of seven  priests led by the Hotar. Although in the R̥gveda and in the later tradition, the  Hotar is the priest who recites the hymns and is secondarily associated with the  root √hū “call,” his name originally meant the “pourer” (derived from the root √hu “pour”), which indicates that his ancient function was both to pour the offerings  and to recite.+++(4)+++ In the R̥gveda he was likely often the composer of the hymns he  recited as well. He is the one priest who has an exact correspondent in the Avestan  tradition, the Zaotar, who already in the Gāthās of Zarathustra also composed and  recited hymns.</p>
<h5 id="potar-neṣṭar">Potar, Neṣṭar</h5>
<p>On the basis of the likely analysis of his name, the Potar was the “purifier,” likely  a purifier of the soma (cf. TB I.4.8), but his R̥gvedic function is unclear. In the classical soma rite, the Neṣṭar, the “leader,” is associated with the wives of the gods and  the wife of the sacrificer. Judging from passages like IV.9.4, in the R̥gveda he had a  connection with the former, which may have expanded to the latter with the introduction of the sacrificer’s wife into the ritual.</p>
<h5 id="agnīdh-adhvaryu">Agnīdh, Adhvaryu</h5>
<p>In the later tradition the Agnīdh or  “fire-kindler” laid and tended the sacrificial fire, in addition to kindling it. He also  acted as the primary assistant to the Adhvaryu, the “ceremoniant,” the priest principally in charge of the ritual acts of the sacrifice.</p>
<h5 id="praśāstar">Praśāstar</h5>
<p>According to II.5.4 the Praśāstar,  “director,” is the priest who knows the “enduring commandments” (dhruvā́ vratā́ni)  that govern the rite. He was likely the forerunner of the Maitrāvaruṇa priest of the  later tradition, who gives the praiṣa or “command” for a particular ritual act to  take place (Minkowski 1991: 118).</p>
<h5 id="brahman">Brahman</h5>
<p>And finally, there is the Brahman. According  to Oldenberg (1917:  396), the Brahman in this list corresponded to the later  Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin, an assistant to the Hotar who recited hymns in honor of Indra.  Oldenberg may be right, but the Brahman in II.1.2 may have been the brahmán elsewhere in the R̥gveda, a composer and reciter of hymns. His liturgical functions were probably not so restricted as those of the Brāhmaṇācchaṃsin. Other passages  contain partial lists of priests and mention priests who are not included among the  seven of II.1.2, although for the most part their functions overlap those already  described.</p>
<h5 id="udgātar">Udgātar</h5>
<p>One remarkable omission from the above lists of priests is a priestly title  corresponding to the singers of the Sāmaveda. Nonetheless, there were singers at  the R̥gvedic period, since especially those hymns composed in pragātha meters were  likely chanted rather than recited. The Udgātar, later the principal priest of the  Sāmavedic tradition, is mentioned as a singer of sāmans in II.34.2, and among those  priests already mentioned the Potar may have chanted the Soma Pavamāna hymns  of book IX. Also, it is possible that unlike the later tradition, in which singers were  distinguished from reciters, R̥gvedic priests both chanted and recited according the  requirements of the ritual.</p>
<h5 id="kavi-uśíj">kavi, uśíj</h5>
<p>A number of other terms describe the ritual participants and priests and their  functions in the rites. While the exact role of the R̥gvedic kaví continues to be  debated, he was linked to the production of poetry and to the mastery of esoteric  knowledge expressed in his words. Our usual translation of kaví as “sage poet”  attempts to capture these two sides of him. Since it has an Avestan cognate kauui,  the term is an old one, and both the roles of the kaví and the kauui undoubtedly went  through many changes in their long histories. Originally, however, the kaví/kauui may have had specific ritual functions within the forerunners of the Avestan and  Vedic rites. Those functions may have complemented those of another figure, the  uśíj, a term that also has an Avestan cognate, usig. Although anciently the uśíj/usig may have been a specific priestly office, the R̥gveda uses the term uśíj to describe  various priests who tend the ritual fire. To give the sense of uśíj as a technical term  for such a category of priests, we have translated it as “fire-priest.” So then, likely  reflecting a very ancient distribution of roles, the uśíj priests were masters of ritual  action, while the kaví was the master of words and knowledge. +++(4)+++</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>Thus, like other aspects of the R̥gvedic rites, the R̥gvedic priesthood was not  fixed. For the R̥gveda we can better understand the names of priests as describing  priestly functions rather than naming professional ritual specialists. Thinking of  them in this way helps us understand why hymns use different names or vary the  names. In a period before the rise of the priestly śākhās, there was less need for  priests to have a determined or single identity. The same people who acted as priests  in the ritual could be warriors or perform other social roles in other contexts.</p>
<h3 id="c-soma-ritual">C. Soma Ritual</h3>
<p>As we have frequently had occasion to remark, most of the hymns of the R̥gveda  were composed for the soma ritual. The central rite of this sacrifice was the prepa ration of the soma juice, which was then offered to the gods and shared among  male participants in the rite. In the R̥gvedic period the stalks of the soma plant  were probably placed on a stone and crushed using another stone or stones. The  extracted juice was either transferred to a vessel that contained water and then poured through or onto a woolen filter to purify it. In either case the soma then ran  into another vessel, in which it was mixed with milk. In the Agniṣṭoma of the classical tradition, there are three soma-pressings in a single day, although, as remarked  above, this may not have been true for the whole R̥gvedic period or for all ritual  traditions during the R̥gvedic period. The R̥gveda also knows the Atirātra or “over-night” form of the soma ritual, in which there are still three pressings on one day,  but in which the rite continues across the night. The final offerings of the Atirātra  are then made on the morning of the second day.</p>
<h4 id="soma">soma</h4>
<p>One of the perennial problems in R̥gvedic and Avestan studies has been the identity of the soma plant or its Iranian equivalent, the haoma plant. In the R̥gveda  the effect of soma juice on both humans and gods is described by the verbal root  √mad, roughly “exhilarate” or “elate.” By these translations we mean that the soma  juice invigorated those who drank it and heightened their senses in some fashion.  We could be more precise about the effect of soma if we knew from what plant  it was extracted. Early speculation that the soma juice was an alcoholic drink of  some sort clearly missed the mark, since the preparation of soma does not allow  for fermentation and √mad does not mean “intoxicate,” if that implies drunkenness and not transport. Of the substantial number of possibilities proposed in  more recent times, two have dominated the discussion. (For a review of the various  theories, at least of the time of its writing, see Houben 2003.)</p>
<p>The first is that the  soma plant was a stimulant, and the most frequent candidate for that stimulant  is one or another kind of ephedra. Although not original to him and defended  by other scholars, the interpretation of soma as ephedra was argued with particular plausibility by Harry Falk (1989), largely on the basis of internal evidence in  the R̥gveda. Also in favor of this hypothesis are the use of ephedra in Zoroastrian  ritual even in modern times and the discovery of traces of ephedra at various sites  of the ancient Bactrian-Margiana Archaeological Complex, a culture with apparent connections with Indo-Iranian culture. Neither of these discoveries confirms  the ephedra hypothesis, and there have been and continue to be many critics of it.</p>
<p>Another set of proposals envisions the soma as a hallucinogen. This argument was  most famously put forth by Wasson (1968), who identified the soma plant as the  Amanita muscaria, the fly agaric mushroom. Similarly Flattery and Schwartz (1989)  argued that previous attempts to identify the soma/haoma plant had overvalued  the Vedic evidence and undervalued the Iranian. On the basis of the latter evidence,  their candidate for the soma plant was Peganum harmala, mountain rue, which also  has psychoactive properties. Despite Flattery and Schwartz’s admonitions, recent  defenders of the view that soma was a hallucinogen have continued to focus on the  internal evidence of the R̥gveda. For them √mad implies not so much stimulation  as ecstasy or visionary experience. Stuhrman (2006), for example, cites the hymns’  light imagery and the unexpected associations made by the poets to argue that these  are best explained as reflexes of hallucinogenic experience.</p>
<p>This is not an issue that we can resolve, and we would leave it aside if we could.  But the identification of soma affects the interpretation of some hymns and particularly the translation of the various forms of the root √mad. In general, we  find more textual evidence to support the interpretation of the soma juice as a  stimulant than as a hallucinogen. Neither the imagery of the poems nor the vision  of the poets requires a hallucinogen to explain them.+++(5)+++ Our view of the hymns is that  they are careful, often intricate compositions that attest to the skill and imagination  of the poets. There is no need to assume the poets experienced the effects of a hallucinogen, and some reason not to do so. To explain what is bizarre and obscure in  these hymns by pharmacology can inhibit the effort to see the underlying logic and  intention of the hymns. While there is much that remains obscure in the R̥gveda,  interpreters of the text have been able to make progress by the simple assumption that the hymns do make sense and that the poets did know exactly what they  were doing.</p>
<h3 id="d-other-rituals">D. Other Rituals</h3>
<h4 id="pravargya">Pravargya</h4>
<p>In describing Vedic ritual we have thus far been discussing the soma sacrifice. But  while the soma sacrifice dominates the R̥gveda, the collection includes hymns composed for other rites as well. One of the sub-rites of the classical soma ritual is the  Pravargya, which according to most ritual sūtras is performed twice daily on the  three days leading up to the soma-pressing day. At an earlier stage, likely represented by the R̥gveda, the Pravargya was an independent rite, which was only later  incorporated into the soma tradition. Although the Pravargya is not mentioned by  name in R̥gveda, the text refers to the rite at the center of the Pravargya, an offering  to the Aśvins of gharmá, a mixture of hot milk and ghee, and the underlying verbal  lexeme prá √vr̥j is used in ritual context.</p>
<h4 id="rājasūya">Rājasūya</h4>
<p>A number of other hymns, especially in book X, also refer to a Rājasūya, a royal  consecration rite, and other rites defining and affirming royal sovereignty. The cen tral rite in the classical Rājasūya was the royal unction, in which water was poured  on the king. This water conferred on the king royal power and authority. Again, the  unction rite itself is not mentioned, but the symbolism of water as a substance that  confers power on the king and over which a successful king must exercise power is  very much part of the R̥gvedic tradition. While R̥gvedic kingship may have differed  significantly from later kingship, other classical symbols of kingship also appear  in the R̥gveda, such as the association of the king and the sun (cf. X.121) and the  identification of king with Varuṇa and Indra, who represent two kinds of sovereignty (cf. IV.42).</p>
<h4 id="animal-sacrifice">animal sacrifice</h4>
<p>The animal sacrifice, either as an independent rite or as a part of the soma sacri fice, is not very prominent in the R̥gveda and is generally alluded to by its paraphernalia, actions, and verbal accompaniment rather than treated directly. The most  salient piece of equipment is the yūpa, the post to which the sacrificial animal is  tied. The yūpa is celebrated in a single hymn, III.8, which is actually a composite of  two parallel hymns, one appropriate to a single post for a single sacrificial animal, one to multiple posts for several victims. The hymn concerns only the preparation  of the posts; there is no mention of the sacrificial victim(s).</p>
<p>One of the most dramatic actions in the later animal sacrifice is the threefold  circumambulation of the victim by a priest, the Āgnīdhra, carrying a firebrand.  When in some R̥gvedic hymns the ritual Agni is said to “go around,” the reference seems to be to this circumambulation—though again the victim is mentioned  barely or not at all (see esp. IX.92.6, 97.1, where soma’s circling of the filter is com pared to the Hotar’s circling of “the fixed seats provided with [sacrificial] beasts”;  see also I.173.3, VII.18.22, X.22.14). Elsewhere (VI.1.3, V.43.7) the first and most  highly prized part of the sacrificial beast to be ritually offered in later śrauta ritual,  the omentum, is alluded to, again without direct mention of the sacrificing of the  animal.</p>
<p>The most significant representation of the animal sacrifice in the R̥gveda, albeit  again indirect, is found in the litanies known as the Āprī hymns. In the later ritual  the Āprī litany accompanied the fore-offerings of the animal sacrifice. The R̥gveda  contains ten such hymns; in them a set series of subjects or key words— ritual personnel (e.g., Tvaṣṭar), qualities (e.g., “well kindled”), or equipment (e.g., ritual  grass)—are treated in a fixed order, though with variable wording, generally in  eleven or twelve verses. One of the pieces of equipment is the yūpa, the wooden post  mentioned above, though under the epithet “Lord of the Forest” (=tree). But the  actual sacrifice of an animal is never mentioned in these hymns; at best the victim is  delicately referred to as an oblation.</p>
<h5 id="śunaḥśepa">Śunaḥśepa</h5>
<p>There is also indirect reference to the animal sacrifice in mythological allusion to  the Śunaḥśepa story, in which the young brahmin boy so named is almost offered  up as a sacrifice to the gods, though he is rescued at the last minute. Although the  story is best known from the very full narrative in the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa (VII.13– 18), his dramatic release is alluded to in the R̥gveda quite explicitly (see esp. V.2.7,  also I.24.12–13).</p>
<h4 id="aśvamedha">Aśvamedha</h4>
<p>Perhaps the most extravagant and dramatic ritual in the classical śrauta system  is the great royal sacrifice, the Aśvamedha or Horse Sacrifice, to be performed by  a king to consolidate or display his power. It involves letting a stallion roam at will  for a year, accompanied by armed troops who fight the sovereigns of any territory  into which the horse strays. When the horse returns at the end of the year, it is  sacrificed, along with numerous other victims, with due pomp but also with almost  unimaginably outlandish accompanying actions. At the climax of the ritual the  chief wife of the king has sex (or simulated sex) with the just-slaughtered horse on  the ritual ground, while the other queens and their female attendants circle around,  singing and dancing and trading obscene jokes with the officiating priests.+++(5)+++</p>
<p>Two late  R̥gvedic hymns (I.162–163) directly treat the Horse Sacrifice, although the later  sexual extravaganza is either unknown to them or, more likely, delicately omitted  from discussion. The first (I.162) describes the (literally) gory details of the sacrifice  itself, while commending the sacrificed horse and all its gear to the gods, while the  second (I.163) lavishly lauds the horse and identifies it with the sun on its journey34 The Rigveda to the gods. Moreover, if we are correct in our interpretation of X.86, the famous salacious three-way conversation among Indra, his wife Indrāṇī, and Indra’s pal,  the monkey Vr̥ṣākapi, this hymn is a burlesque or parody (though a serious one) of  the Horse Sacrifice, with the monkey standing in for the horse-victim, Indrāṇī for  the wife who must mate with the animal victim, and Indra for the king and sacrificer who stands by and watches this mating. This interpretation presupposes that  the dramatic sexual aspect of the Aśvamedha was already present in the R̥gvedic  version of the rite and is simply not mentioned in I.162–163.</p>
<h4 id="funeral">Funeral</h4>
<p>In addition to the rituals that will be codified in the later classical śrauta system,  the R̥gveda marginally treats rituals that will form part of the gr̥hya, or “domestic,”  ritual system, primarily life-cycle rites. The R̥gvedic treatments are almost exclusively found in late portions of the text, in Maṇḍala X, and often have parallels  in the Atharvaveda. The funeral is treated in a series of hymns (X.14–18) in the  Yama cycle. Of particular interest are X.16, which concerns the cremation fire and  the actual burning of the dead man’s body, and X.18, which describes the funeral  service, the burial, and the return of those still living to their lives. Verses 7–9 of  X.18 have attracted special attention because they appear to depict the widow of  the dead man, first lying beside the dead man and then being recalled to life and to  remarriage—thus suggesting that while the later institution of satī or widow burning is not attested in the R̥gveda, the ritual representation of the widow’s ceremonial death (though followed by ceremonial rebirth) could have provided a model for  a more literal enactment. Many of the verses in this group of hymns are found also  in the Atharvaveda funeral hymns, XVIII.1–4. Another hymn, X.56, describes the  ascent of the body of the deceased by means of the cremation fire and its transformation into an immortal body in heaven (see Brereton forthcoming a). A long and episodic hymn, X.85, is devoted to the wedding. Many of its verses  are found also in the Atharvaveda wedding hymns and are utilized in the gr̥hya sūtra  protocols for the wedding ceremony. After a long mythological prologue, the hymn  proceeds (sometimes in jumbled fashion) from the wooing of the bride-to-be to the  journey of the newly married couple to the new home, with a very interesting (and  barely comprehensible) treatment of the deflowering of the bride.</p>
<h4 id="marriage">Marriage</h4>
<p>The R̥gveda also provides a certain amount of evidence for the institution of the  Svayaṃvara or bridal “self-choice” marriage, familiar to anyone who has ever stud ied first-year Sanskrit and read the Mahābhārata story of Nala and Damayantī,  whose engagement took that form. Most of the R̥gvedic evidence is mythological,  as the archetypal divine bride in the text is Sūryā, daughter of the sun, who exer cises her choice (see especially Jamison 2001), but there is also lexical evidence (see  Jamison 2003) as well as incidental imagery, especially in Dawn hymns, of young  girls in such a situation.</p>
<h4 id="pregnancy-and-birth">Pregnancy and birth</h4>
<p>Pregnancy and birth, a major preoccupation in the later gr̥hya material, is barely  represented in the R̥gveda. There is a charm for safe childbirth (X.184), which fol lows immediately on a brief dialogue between husband and wife attempting to con ceive (X.183), and in a short series of hymns against disease we find one against dangers of miscarriage (X.162). Maṇḍala V also contains a charm for safe child birth embedded in an Aśvin hymn (V.78.7–10) and motivated by the mythological  case of (the male seers) Atri and Saptavadhri, trapped in tight quarters like a child  in the womb.</p>
<h2 id="v-the-gods">V. The Gods</h2>
<h3 id="a-nature-of-the-gods">A. Nature of the Gods</h3>
<h4 id="yāskas-classification">Yāska&rsquo;s classification</h4>
<p>The great majority of R̥gvedic hymns are dedicated to individual gods or to groups  of gods. Following a classification articulated already in I.139.11, Yāska (Nir.  VII.5) divided the gods into three categories: gods of the earth, gods of the mid space, and gods of heaven. This simple scheme has the advantage of being clear  and the disadvantage of being misleading. For while the R̥gvedic pantheon includes  deities who represent the visible realities and powers of the natural world, it is not  fully composed of such gods.</p>
<h4 id="names">Names</h4>
<p>A better starting place for most of the gods is their  names. As we shall see, the R̥gveda attaches great importance to the names of gods.+++(5)+++  By invoking, varying, and meaningfully placing gods’ names in their verses and by  echoing the sounds of those names, the poets bring about the presence of the gods,  their epiphany. More than in any other single feature, the essential nature of a deity  is expressed in the god’s name. The god is who the god is because the god obeys  the truth embedded in that name. Thus the goddess Dawn is the Dawn because  she adheres to the truth that she appears in the morning before the sun.+++(4)+++ The god  Parjanya, Thunderstorm, is the Thunderstorm because he adheres to the truth that  he sends the rain. To be sure, the meanings of the names of some gods, such as  Viṣṇu, the Nāsatyas, or the Maruts, are unclear or controversial, and the names of  other gods, such as the Aśvins (“Horsemen”), imperfectly represent their characters. By and large, however, the names of gods define their natures and actions. This  is one reason that the gods of the R̥gveda can appear to be flat, since they generally  lack the complex personalities that the gods of classical India possess. But there is  considerable complexity in the relations among R̥gvedic deities, in the fusion and  fission of deities, and in the dimensions of gods indicated by different names and  epithets.</p>
<p>Starting with their names, we can classify gods according to their different  spheres of action. This categorization will be porous, since some gods cross bound aries of domains and functions, and will be more orderly than R̥gvedic reality, but  it gives an approximate shape to the R̥gvedic pantheon. There are at least five categories of divinities.</p>
<h4 id="gods-of-nature">gods of nature</h4>
<p>First there are gods of nature, the powers that represent and  govern natural phenomena and entities, such as Sūrya, the “Sun,” Vāyu “Wind,”  Parjanya “Thunderstorm,” Uṣas “Dawn,” and Dyaus and Pr̥thivī “Heaven and  Earth.” With some exceptions, the names of these deities are also words for the  phenomena they represent. So, for example, the word sū́rya can signify either the sun god or the sun itself, or, rather, it signifies both the sun god and the sun, since  the two are not fully distinguished. However, these gods of nature do not act only  within the natural sphere defined by their names, but enlarge their sphere of action  on the basis of their natural characteristics. In I.115.1, for example, the Sun is called  “the eye of Mitra, Varuṇa, and Agni,” because the Sun, as he transits the sky, looks  down upon the actions of human beings and observes whether they conform to  the ritual and social principles governed by these other deities.</p>
<p>In V.80.5 the light  brought by the goddess Dawn disperses not only the physical darkness of night but  also the “powers of darkness,” the dangerous forces at work within the world. And  according to V.83.9 the god Parjanya, Thunderstorm, not only shakes the world,  but also smashes evildoers. Thus the principle of hidden connections and corre spondences allows the gods of nature operate in other spheres in manners analogous to their natural functions.</p>
<h4 id="gods-defined-by-the-social-sphere">Gods defined by the social sphere</h4>
<p>A second category of divinity includes those defined by the social sphere in which  they operate. The most prominent deities in this category are the three principal  Ādityas: Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman. As detailed below, these gods represent the  different principles that define social relations, and they ensure that human beings  act according to these principles. As the gods of nature have functions within the  social world, so these gods of the social world also have functions within the natural world. They are associated with the sun, as illustrated by I.115.1, and Varuṇa  especially governs the waters, granting them to those who uphold the principles  he represents, withholding them from those who do not. In this way, the processes  of the visible world become the assurance of the reality of the principles of the  social world.</p>
<h4 id="defined-by-function">defined by function</h4>
<p>Still other gods are defined by an action or function that their names embody.  Perhaps the most obvious example is Savitar, the “Impeller,” who compels humans  and other living beings to action or sends them to rest. Similarly, there is Tvaṣṭar,  the “Fashioner,” Viśvakarman, the “All-Maker,” and various other minor “agent  gods” as Macdonell (1897:  115)  called them. Perhaps fitting into this category,  albeit awkwardly, are the Aśvins, the “Horsemen.” As the name of these two gods  suggests, they characteristically drive their chariot, and their mobility is a significant part of what defines them. They ride to accomplish many purposes: to heal, to  rescue, or even to facilitate marriage. As charioteers and riders, therefore, they move  within a variety of places and spheres.</p>
<h4 id="those-embodying-aspects-of-the-ritual">Those embodying aspects of the ritual</h4>
<p>Fourth are gods who embody aspects of the ritual, a category dominated by  the two gods who, except for Indra, are the most frequently invoked deities of the  R̥gveda, Agni and Soma. Agni is the sacrificial fire and Soma the central offering  at the principal sacrifice in the R̥gvedic tradition. The particular significance of  the ritual gods is their accessibility to humans.+++(5)+++ Various gods can be present at  the sacrifice, but Indra and other gods like Mitra and Varuṇa remain invisible.  Gods like the Wind, the Dawn, or the Sun are perceptible, but they are distant  or amorphous. Agni and Soma, however, are visibly, tangibly present, right in  front of the priests and sacrificers, and their presence can be reliably brought about by human action. They are the representives of the divine within reach of  humans, and therefore they can create the link between gods and humans upon  which the life of both gods and humans depends. So, Agni is the messenger who  conveys the gods to mortals (e.g., I.14.12, III.6.9, IV.8.2, VII.11.5), and he is  the Hotar priest who brings humans’ offerings to the gods (e.g., I.1.1, VIII.60.1,  X.7.5). And likewise, Soma descends from heaven to the human world (IX.61.10,  63.27, 66.30) and, when offered by humans, goes from these humans to the gods  (IX.25.4, 39.1).+++(4)+++</p>
<h4 id="indra">Indra</h4>
<p>The last category belongs to Indra, who stands apart from all the other gods.  Although it might once have had other resonance, the word índra means only Indra,  which makes it not quite unique but a still rarity among the names of gods. The  greatest number of hymns, nearly a quarter of all the hymns of the R̥gveda, are  dedicated to him. This preeminence in the R̥gveda is not surprising since the soma  sacrifice is primarily a sacrifice to Indra. Indra and Vāyu are the first of the paired  divinities who receive soma in the morning; Indra alone or with the Maruts receives  soma at midday; and, at least according to some R̥gvedic traditions, Indra and the  R̥bhus receive soma in the evening (cf. IV.35.7). Thus, even though the soma sacri fice gradually incorporated other rites and other gods, Indra and the offerings to  Indra remained central to it.</p>
<h3 id="b-devas-and-asuras">B. Devas and Asuras</h3>
<p>Beginning with the Vedic prose texts, one of the most enduring mythological struc tures is the perpetual conflict between Devas (devá being the Sanskrit word for  “god”) and Asuras, with the two (almost) balanced groups contending with each  other in numerous myths and myth fragments in all sorts of situations. The Asuras  are, as it were, the anti-Devas, with negative traits exactly corresponding to the posi tive ones possessed by the Devas. In the various combats depicted, the Devas always  prevail, but only barely. This conflict continues to be prominent in the post-Vedic  religious landscape, as in the well-known story of the churning of the ocean of milk  in which the two moieties fight over the treasures churned up.</p>
<p>An apparent mirror image of this paired opposition is found in Old Iranian in  the Avestan texts, where ahura, the direct cognate of Sanskrit ásura, is the title of  the head of the pantheon, Ahura Mazdā “Lord Wisdom,” and the daēuuas (exact  cognate of Sanskrit devá) are the enemies of all that is good. Although it has always  been tempting to superimpose the Avestan and middle Vedic situations upon each  other, the R̥gveda makes serious difficulties. There the term ásura is generally in the  singular, used as a title (“lord”) in a positive sense, and is often applied to divinities who are otherwise identified as Devas.+++(5)+++ A particularly striking example is found  in VIII.25.4 where Mitra and Varuṇa are called Devas and Asuras simultaneously  (devā́v ásurā “[the two] Devas, [the two] Asuras”). The Asuras as a defined group  only begin to appear in the late R̥gveda. For further discussion see Hale (1986). The history and significance of the Avestan/post-R̥gvedic mirror-image pairing of the  two terms remain unclear.</p>
<h3 id="c-visve-devah">C. Viśve DevĀḤ</h3>
<p>The term víśve devā́ḥ “all the gods” or “the All Gods” is common in the R̥gveda,  and the Anukramaṇī identifies the divinity of a large number of hymns as víśve  devā́ḥ. The term, both in its usage in the text and in its application to a hymn type,  is employed in a number of different senses. On the one hand, it is a handy way to  refer to the whole divine community, to ensure that no god has been left out of a  generic eulogy or request for aid. In this usage the gods are not treated as individuals but as an undifferentiated group, opposed to mortals or, later, the Asuras (see  just above). This group ultimately becomes conceived of as a sort of corporate  entity, the All Gods. On the other hand, many Viśve Devāḥ hymns do not encompass the whole group, but name a series of individual gods, each one often allotted  a single verse in a list hymn (e.g., VI.49). Here the phrase “all the gods” is a way  of indicating that the hymn is not targeting a single god, as in the majority or  R̥gvedic hymns, but selecting from the group. And finally a number of hymns with  the Anukramaṇī designation “all gods” actually have very little to do with the gods  at all, but contain meditations on the mysteries of the cosmos, of the sacrifice, or of  the powers of poetry and ritual speech (see, e.g., I.105).+++(4)+++</p>
<h3 id="d-indra">D. Indra</h3>
<p>As the preeminent god of the R̥gveda, Indra has a variety of roles. But first of  all Indra is a warrior, upon whom depend the protection and prosperity of his  worshipers. His weapon is the vájra, the mace. In later tradition, when Indra was  reduced to a storm god, the vajra became a thunderbolt. But in the R̥gveda it was a  weapon, which could be thrown at an enemy or smashed down upon him, and the  principal means by which Indra asserted his power.</p>
<p>The foremost story of Indra in the R̥gveda is the narrative of the battle between  Indra and Vr̥tra. Vr̥tra was a gigantic cobra, who was twisted around a mountain  that enclosed the waters. In order for life to exist Vr̥tra had to be destroyed. Indra  battled the serpent, alone, according to some hymns, or with the help of the Maruts  or other gods, according to others. After a furious battle Indra killed Vr̥tra with his  mace and smashed open the mountain, releasing the waters. This myth is occasionally merged with others, so that not only the waters but also the cattle and the sun  emerge from the mountain. The name Vr̥tra means “obstacle,” and one of the char acteristic epithets of Indra is vr̥trahán, which can mean either “smasher of Vr̥tra”  or “smasher of obstacles.” There is little difference between these two interpreta tions, however, since Vr̥tra is the paradigm of all obstacles. To evoke Indra as the  smasher of Vr̥tra, therefore, is to evoke him as the god who smashes all obstacles.</p>
<p>The narrative of the destruction of Vr̥tra is associated particularly with the midday  soma-pressing, which is dedicated to Indra alone or to Indra and the Maruts. The Vala myth is the second great narrative of Indra and a complement to the  Vr̥tra story. According to this myth a group called the Paṇis captured the cattle  and kept them trapped in the Vala cave. Indra opened the Vala cave and released  the cattle and the dawns. Remarkable in this story is that Indra does not release  the cattle using his mace as his weapon, but rather using the power of the truth in  the songs he chants. Accompanying him and joining him in his chant are groups  of priests, the Aṅgirases, sometimes along with the Navagvas or the Daśagvas. In  this narrative, therefore, Indra is a priest-king rather than a warrior-king as he is in  the Vr̥tra myth. In his role as priest-king Indra is also called bŕ̥haspáti, the “lord of  the sacred formulation.” Br̥haspati appears not only as Indra, but also as a separate  divinity alongside Indra. Gradually, as Indra and the Vedic king, who personifies  Indra, progressively lose their priestly functions in the late R̥gveda and in the later  Vedic tradition, Br̥haspati increasingly stands apart from Indra. As the Vr̥tra story  is connected with the Midday Pressing, so the Vala story was associated with the  Morning Pressing, which takes place with the appearance of dawn.+++(5)+++ In the R̥gvedic  period the dakṣiṇā, the reward of cattle to the priests, was also given at the Morning  Pressing. The cattle that come to the priests thus reflect the advent of the cattle and  dawns in the world.+++(4)+++</p>
<p>Although the two major mythological narratives with Indra as protagonist are  the Vr̥tra and the Vala victories, he figures in many other episodes—too many to  mention here—which are often fragmentarily attested and poorly understood.</p>
<p>We may start with his parentage. Although the identity of Indra’s mother is not  clear, in the occasional mentions of her she is a vivid character—as in the snatches  of dialogue between him and his mother in the famous birth hymn IV.18, where she  tries to persuade him not to pursue an unnatural exit from her womb. Elsewhere she  offers him soma to drink directly after his birth, soma that he stole from his father,  named as Tvaṣṭar (III.48; also IV.18.3). And in an even more enigmatic snatch of  dialogue (VIII.45.4–6 ≅ VIII.77.1–2) she seems to reassure the just-born Indra that  he will ultimately prevail. As just noted, Indra seems to participate in a rivalry  with his father, who may be Tvaṣṭar. The unnatural birth and the rivalry with the  divine father are of course well-nigh universal attributes of “the hero”; the many  prodigious feats attributed to Indra just after his birth are also typical of heroic  biography.
Two minor but intriguing myths pit Indra against the two most important  forms of celestial light, the Sun and Dawn. We find the merest allusions (primarily  IV.30.8–11) to a puzzling episode in which Indra crushes the cart of Dawn and she  runs away. Alluded to just a bit more (primarily V.29.5, 9–10; V.31.11; I.121.13) is  the chariot race in which Indra bests the chariot of the Sun, apparently by tearing  the wheel off his chariot. This latter myth is somehow connected with one that is  better attested, though hardly better understood, in which Indra and a sidekick  Kutsa drive on the same chariot, drawn by the horses of the Wind, to the house
40 The Rigveda
of Uśanā Kāvya (a name with a shadowy attestation also in Avestan mythology),  to receive some aid or advice, preliminary to slaying Śuṣṇa, the often-mentioned  opponent of Kutsa.
Indra has a number of other named adversaries. In one striking whiff of a narra tive, Indra, aided by Viṣṇu in some versions, shoots a boar named Emuṣa, enabling  him to acquire a special mess of rice porridge hidden in or behind a mountain (see  esp. VIII.77; also VIII.69.14–15, I.61.7). This myth is further developed in Vedic  prose. Another myth with more presence in later texts involves Indra’s slaying of  Namuci by beheading him (e.g., V.30.7–8). In the later versions Indra accomplishes  this by trickery, and part of the trick (using the foam of the waters as weapon) is  already mentioned once in the R̥gveda (VIII.14.13). The names of other victims  of Indra include Śambara, Pipru, Dhuni and Cumuri, and Varcin, inter alia. The  details of these battles are too sketchy to provide much in the way of narrative  mythology.
Like a number of other gods, Indra has his characteristic draft-animals, and  his are especially prominently featured in the text. His pair of fallow bays (hárī)  conveys him everywhere, especially to and from the sacrifice. They have their own  food offered to them at the sacrifice (roasted grain, see, e.g., III.35), and hymns were  even devoted to a libation made when the pair was hitched up for the return journey  after the sacrifice (see I.61–63). The mention of the fallow bays is sufficient to signal  that Indra is present in the context, and hárivant “possessing the fallow bays” is a  standing epithet of Indra.
E. Agni “Fire”
The word agní is both the common noun meaning “fire” and the name of the god  who is deified fire. As with sóma (see below), it is often difficult to draw the line  between these uses. The sacrificial system of the R̥gveda (and later Vedic texts), like  that of the cognate Old Iranian Avestan texts, is focused around the ritual fire. The  sacrificial ground is defined by the presence of sanctified fire(s), oblations are made  into them, and the gods and priests gather round them. Thus, first and foremost,  Agni is the god always present at our ritual performances and the immediate recipi
ent of our offerings. He is the most prominent of the R̥gvedic gods after Indra, and  all the Family Books and most of the smaller bardic collections open with their  Agni hymns.
Agni as ritual fire is both recipient of oblations in his own right and the conduit  of oblations destined for other gods, which are offered into the ritual fire. He is  therefore regularly called the mouth of the gods, and his role as the middleman  between the human offerers and divine recipients is often emphasized. The flames  and especially the smoke of the fire carry the oblations to heaven, but also, perhaps  more often, serve as a means for the gods to come to earth to our sacrifice: Agni is  said to be the conveyor of the gods many, many times in the text. He is a middleman  in another sense, as a god who nonetheless dwells intimately among mortals. For us
Introduction 41
he is both ally and messenger to the more distant gods, and since he is not one of us  but a divinity, he is viewed as and often called our guest.
But the ritual fire is not the only form of Agni. The poets emphasize both the  divine aspects of Agni and his purely physical form, often intermingling references  to different forms of fire in the same hymn. As a god he is often identified with the  sun, the celestial form of fire: blazing hot, shining bright, and appearing at the same  time of day, namely dawn when the sun rises and the ritual fire is kindled. But the  fire on our sacrificial ground is also clearly kin to the fire on our domestic hearth;  indeed in later śrauta ritual the fire from which the other ritual fires are taken out  is called the Gārhapatya or “householders’ (fire).” Agni is therefore also praised for  his contribution to daily life and the pleasures of home and family.
The potentially destructive aspects of fire are not forgotten, however. Many of  the most inventive descriptions in Agni hymns are of the wild, uncontrollable ram pages of forest fire, spreading across the land and “eating” everything in its path.  We seek to harness this destructive power of fire, to turn it against our enemies  and other threats to our safety, and Agni, sometimes with the epithet rakṣohán “demon-smasher,” is urged to turn his relentless flames against opponents we name.  A subtype of destructive fire is the funeral fire, the “flesh-eating” fire of cremation,  which is both welcomed and feared (see esp. X.16).
The paradoxical nature of physical fire also provides some part of the god  Agni’s personal qualities. That fire is fueled by plants, especially wood, contributes  to the belief that Agni lives concealed within the plants, even very juicy ones, until  his birth. Agni also comes to be identified with a minor divinity going back to  Indo-Iranian times, Apām Napāt “child of the waters,” who was probably origi
nally separate—a glowing fiery being concealed and nurtured in the waters, prob ably configured in part as lightning.
The creation or birth of the ritual fire from the kindling sticks, his parents, is  a major subject in Agni hymns, with intricate descriptions of the first stirrings of  flame and smoke as the friction of the kindling sticks produces sparks that finally  catch. The just-born Agni is depicted as a tender babe, who quickly grows to become  stronger than his parents and to devour the plants from which he was born.
Many aspects of Agni are expressed through the variety of names and epithets  applied to him. Agni is Jātavedas as the fire established at the beginning of the rite  that continues to its end. As an unbroken presence in the ritual, Agni Jātavedas  also oversees the succession of generations, ensuring that a family’s lineage will  continue. Agni Vaiśvānara is the fire become the sun. As the sun, this fire sees every
thing and governs everyone. This form of Agni is especially associated with the  king, who like the sun stands above and reaches all beings. The word vaiśvānará means the one “relating to all men.” Agni is also Tanūnapāt and Narāśaṃsa. One or  another of these names—or sometimes both (I.13.2–3)—appear in the Āprī hymns,  which are recited in an animal sacrifice, and they both occur outside of the Āprī hymns as well. The word tánūnápāt describes Agni as the “son of himself,” and  nárāśáṃsa as the one “who embodies men’s praise” of the gods. As Agni Kravyād,
42 The Rigveda
the “flesh-eating fire,” Agni is the fire of the funeral pyre that consumes the body  of the deceased and transports it to heaven. Mātariśvan is sometimes identified as  Agni himself, but he is more properly the one who brought the fire from heaven.
Agni participates in almost no narrative mythology, in strong contrast to Indra.  Besides the very sketchy account of Mātariśvan’s theft of fire from heaven, there is  one, ritually connected, tale—of Agni’s flight from the sacrificial ground and his  self-concealment in the waters, to avoid his ritual role as bearer of oblations to the  gods. The gods find him in his hiding place and coax him back by promising him a  share of the oblations. This myth is treated most fully in the late sequence X.51–53,  but there are glancing mentions of it elsewhere. The story may have in part been  generated by the conflation of Agni with the originally distinct divine figure Apām  Napāt “Child of the Waters,” on which see II.35.
F. Soma
Like Agni, Soma is both a god and a crucial ritual substance, and the boundary  between them is not always clear. As has already been discussed, the juice of the  soma plant (whatever that may have been), pressed from the plant and elabo rately prepared, is the chief offering of the most important complex of rituals, the  soma sacrifice. This sacrificial substance and its ritual preparation go back to the  Indo-Iranian period, since Avestan attests to the substance haoma, an exact cognate  to Sanskrit sóma, and to its pressing and offering (see especially the so-called Hōm  Yašt, Y 9–10). In both traditions the substance is also deified.
The “Soma Maṇḍala” of the R̥gveda, Maṇḍala IX, contains 114 hymns dedi cated to Soma Pavamāna “Self-Purifying Soma.” These hymns focus entirely on a  single ritual moment, the pressing of the plant, the straining of the juice by pour ing it over a sheep’s fleece to trap the impurities (twigs and the like), the mixing  of the juice first with water and then with milk, and the pouring into containers  prior to offering it to the gods, especially Indra. These actions are often presented  metaphorically, with Soma conceptualized as a king making a royal progress across  the filter and into the cups, a progress that can be compared to the conquering of  territory. Or as the Sun in his journey through the cosmos. Or, quite often, as a bull  racing to mate with a herd of cows, who represent the milk with which the juice will  be mixed. Soma is thus regularly presented as having agency in the many descrip tions of the purification of the liquid.
Besides this dynamic deification especially characteristic of the IXth Maṇḍala,  there is little narrative mythology involving the god Soma. The most important  tale is the theft of Soma from heaven, where he was confined in a citadel guarded  by an archer called Kr̥śānu. A falcon stole him and brought him to earth, success
fully evading serious injury from Kr̥śānu’s arrow, to deliver him to Manu, the first  sacrificer. This exploit is mentioned a number of times in the text, but is most fully  described in IV.26–27.
Though one characteristic of Soma in later texts, a commonplace already in  middle Vedic, is his identification with the moon, this equation is only attested in
Introduction 43
the very late R̥gveda. It is clearly found only in the Wedding Hymn (X.85), whose  first verses depict the wedding of Soma and Sūryā, daughter of the Sun. The bride groom Soma in this hymn has clear lunar qualities, which are distinguished from his  identity as an earthy ritual substance.
G. Aditi and the ādityas
As a group, the Ādityas generally represent the powers that order human society.  This function is most evident in the three principal Ādityas, Varuṇa, Mitra, and  Aryaman. In addition to these three, however, there are minor deities who are also  called Ādityas—Dakṣa, Bhaga, and Aṃśa—and a number of other gods, such as  Savitar and Sūrya, who may be called Ādityas when they exercise functions like  those of the major Ādityas.
The Ādityas are sons of the goddess Aditi, whose name means “offenselessness”  or “innocence.” She embodies obedience to the principles of right social behavior  that her sons represent. Later, the motherhood of Aditi becomes central to her  identity and she becomes a mother to other deities.
The most prominent of the Ādityas is Varuṇa, whose name is related to vratá “commandment” and who therefore is the god of commandments. While all the  major Ādityas are kings, Varuṇa in particular represents the authority of the king.  In IV.42, as in the later Rājasūya, the king becomes both Varuṇa and Indra; that is,  as Varuṇa, the king is a judicial authority governing the actions of his subjects, and  as Indra, he is a leader in war. Accordingly, the divine acts of Varuṇa were often  reflected in the functions of the R̥gvedic king. Like the king, Varuṇa watches over  his subjects by means of his spáśaḥ “spies” (e.g., I.25.13). One of the responsibili
ties of the king was to ensure the prosperity of his subjects by providing sufficient  water for animals and crops. Therefore, the divine king Varuṇa brings rain (V.85.3– 4) and controls the waters, causing them to flow according to his commandment  (II.28.4). As the king orders the human world, so Varuṇa orders both the human  world and the world at large: the moon and stars appear and disappear according  to his commandment (I.24.10), and he makes a place and a path for the sun in the  sky (I.24.8, V.85.2, VII.87.1, 5). The king maintained the social order by punishing  wrong-doers, and, likewise, poets fear Varuṇa’s anger and his fetters (pā́śāḥ), with  which he binds those who violate his commandments (e.g., I.24.15, 25.21). Varuṇa  is the master of the truth that governs the actions of things, as the king must be as  well (II.28.6). Given that his kingship complements Indra’s, we might have expected  Varuṇa to have had a greater presence in the R̥gveda than he does. However, the  R̥gveda emerged primarily from the soma rite, and the soma rite belongs to Indra.  In the R̥gvedic period there probably were other rites dedicated to Varuṇa or to  Varuṇa and other Ādityas—there is such a rite in the classical tradition—but these  left little trace in the R̥gveda.
In most hymns Varuṇa is closely connected to Mitra, with whom he shares most  of his royal functions. Unlike váruṇa, the meaning of mitrá is reasonably certain.  A mitrá was an ally or an alliance, and Mitra is the god of alliances. While Varuṇa44 The Rigveda
governs relations in which one person has authority over another, Mitra governs  relations defined by mutual obligations. These two kinds of relationships overlap  with one another, so it is not surprising that the functions of Mitra and Varuṇa  likewise often coincide and that the two gods are so often paired. Only one hymn,  III.59, is dedicated to Mitra alone. As the god of alliances, Mitra governs peace  agreements between different people, ensuring that they will take their proper  places (III.59.1, 5; cf. VII.36.2) and remain in them (III.59.6). When other gods  have functions similar to Mitra’s, they may be identified with him. In particular,  Agni is sometimes called Mitra (e.g., III.5.4) or creates a mitrá, an alliance, when he  appears at dawn. The alliance to which such passages refer is the sacrificial alliance  between gods and mortals. Humans offer the truth in their hymns and offer soma,  milk, ghee, and the like as their oblations. In this way, they empower the gods, and  the gods in turn provide what is necessary for human life.
The last of the major Ādityas is Aryaman, the god of the customs of the Āryas.  He therefore represents a third social principle, the customary rules that govern  relations among Vedic tribes and peoples. This principle was especially essential in  a society where the authority of the ruler would not have penetrated deeply into  the daily lives or the households of his people. Among the spheres in which custom  determined behavior was marriage, which created a new social bond between unre
lated families. Since marriage depended on the recognition of custom, marriage  fell within Aryaman’s governance. While we have presented Aryaman as the god  of customs, Thieme (1938, 1957) and other scholars following him have preferred  to see Aryaman more narrowly as the god governing the rules of hospitality. In the  absence of a state, the Vedic peoples needed to expect Ārya strangers to recognize  and to act according to the customary norms of hospitality. Such norms were criti
cal in creating the possibility of relations among Āryas and therefore in unifying  them. Aryaman does not often appear apart from Varuṇa and Mitra and shares  their broader roles in maintaining the natural as well as the social world.
Although relatively minor presences, three other gods, Bhaga, the god of for tune, Aṃśa, the god of the share, and Dakṣa, the god of (priestly) skill, are also  called Ādityas. Bhaga ensures that people will receive an appropriate portion of  the goods of life. He is often linked with Aryaman and with the expectation for the  prosperity of a marriage. Aṃśa ensures that people will receive the share of goods  owed them, and therefore he is concerned with inheritance. In both cases, the two  gods bring goods to people according to their behavior and family identity, and  that function brings them within the sphere of social principles represented by the  major Ādityas. Like the major Ādityas, Dakṣa is also concerned with right behavior,  but in his case, it is the skilled actions of sacrificers. For further on the Ādityas, see  Brereton (1981).
H. Savitar
Sometimes linked to the Ādityas and especially to Bhaga is the god Savitar. He is  the god who “impels” or “compels” beings—and these can include mortals, gods,
Introduction 45
animals, and objects. He especially acts at the beginning of night, when he sends  beings to rest (cf. I.35.2, IV.53.3, VII.45.1). But he also commands the end of the  night and the beginning of the day, when he brings forth the sun (I.35.9) and impels  beings to action. Because he is associated with the night, he is also connected with  the generation of offspring, who would be conceived during the night. Savitar is  bright, with golden eyes, golden arms, and golden hands. He stretches out his arms  in a gesture of command (II.38.2). Falk (1988: 17–22) reasonably suggests that his  brilliance during the night and his outstretched arms point to the Milky Way as a  manifestation of Savitar.
I. SŪrya
If the Milky Way is the celestial embodiment of Savitar, Sūrya, the Sun, comes  close to being that of Mitra and Varuṇa. The Sun is their eye, for his gaze is wide  (VII.35.8) and falls on everyone (I.50.2). The Sun watches over the good and evil  deeds of humans (VI.51.2, VII.60.2–3) and, so the poet hopes, declares the inno
cence of the sacrificers to Mitra and Varuṇa (VII.60.1, 62.2). The Sun is the felly  that rolls toward Mitra and Varuṇa (V.62.2) or the chariot that the two gods set  in heaven (V.63.7). Since he is so closely linked to the Ādityas, he himself is called  an Āditya (I.50.13, 191.9; VIII.101.11). His link to the Ādityas is also a link to the  king, who oversees his subjects the way that the Sun oversees all beings (X.121 and  Proferes 2007: 137–41).
However, Sūrya is not associated exclusively with the Ādityas. He is a form of  Agni, Agni Vaiśvānara, and the face of Agni. Not only the Ādityas (IV.13.2) or  Mitra and Varuṇa (V.63.4), but also Varuṇa and Indra (VII.82.3), Agni (X.3.2),  Soma (VI.44.23, IX.86.22), and Indra and Viṣṇu (VII.99.4) are said to have given  birth to the Sun, to have caused him rise to heaven, or to have established his  brilliance.
A number of images depict the movement of the sun through the heavens. The  Sun flies through the air on a chariot pulled by seven horses or seven mares (I.50.8,  9, IV.13.3, V.45.9), or the Sun is a wheel pulled by only one horse, Etaśa (VII.63.2).  The Sun is also the “reddish eagle” (V.77.3) or a falcon (V.45.9), or he flies like a fal
con (VII.63.5). However, there are relatively few narratives concerning the Sun. One  repeated but mysterious story is that Indra stole or tore off the wheel of the Sun.  He did so in order to help his ally Kutsa in Kutsa’s battle against Śuṣṇa (I.130.9,  175.4, IV.30.4, V.29.10). What exactly Indra accomplished by doing this and how  this helped Kutsa remain unclear.
J. UṢas “Dawn”
Dawn is one of the few female divinities in the R̥gveda and the most prominent  among them. Twenty-one hymns are dedicated to her alone (every maṇḍala but  II, VIII, and of course IX containing at least one), many of them displaying high  poetic artistry and beauty of imagery, and she is mentioned hundreds of times in
46 The Rigveda
the text. She also has an Indo-European pedigree, being cognate with the Greek  goddess Eos and the Latin goddess Aurora.
The femininity of Dawn is one of her defining characteristics. She is generally  depicted as a beautiful young woman, flirtatious and scantily dressed. Since she  embodies the first light of day, she is gleaming and covered with bright ornaments,  and her appearance thus strongly contrasts with that of her dark sister Night, a  much less prominent goddess, though the ceaseless alternation of Dawn and Night  is often remarked on. Her dispelling of the darkness and of fears of night is much  appreciated, as she awakens and rouses everyone to their daily activities. Dawn is  also, not surprisingly, associated with the god Sun, Sūrya, who is often depicted as  following her as her suitor or husband. She is also said to be the mother or possessor  of cows—the cows being the milky sky and rays of light at early dawn (see Watkins  1987 and 2009 for the Indo-European trope of “the milk of the dawn cows”).
Her associations are not all positive, however. Because she heralds every new day,  she reminds men of the unstoppable passage of time and of the aging process, as  well as of the generations of men who used to view the dawn but have passed away.  Dawn’s daily rebirth as an ever-young beauty presents a cruel contrast to the human  condition of change and decay. The poets also often reflect on the paradox that each  Dawn is new but each is the same as the one before and the one that will come after.
The characteristics of Dawn mentioned above are reflections of the universal  nature of dawn, but she also displays culturally specific qualities relating to Vedic  ritual. Dawn ushers in the sacrificial day, especially the kindling of the ritual fire pre paratory to the early-morning rites, and the interplay between the natural sources  of light—dawn and the sun—and the man-made one—fire—is often described as  complex and co-determined. Moreover, Dawn is regularly associated with wealth  and its distribution to the sacrificial participants and is urged to give generously to  them. This association between wealth and dawn has no naturalistic source, but  arises from the fact that in R̥gvedic ritual the dakṣiṇās or “priestly gifts” were dis
tributed to the priests and poets at the early-morning rites (rather than at midday,  as in classical śrauta ritual).
Despite the vividness of her depiction, Dawn participates very little in narrative  mythology, though there is a briefly alluded to (primarily IV.30.8–11) and extremely  enigmatic tale in which Indra smashes the cart of “evilly angry” Dawn, and she  runs away. Why Indra should turn against this emblem of benevolent femininity  is unclear, but the story is also associated with Indra’s stealing the wheel off the  Sun’s chariot, and both may have to do with the perturbation of regular temporal  sequences.
K. VĀyu / VĀta “Wind”
As his name indicates, Vāyu is an ancient god of the Wind, although verses to Vāyu  that refer to the phenomenon of wind are somewhat rare and oblique. For example,
Introduction 47
the roar of Vāyu echoes the sound of the wind, his hundredfold (I.135.3) or thou sandfold (I.135.1) team reflects the wind’s speed, and the Maruts, who personify  thunderstorms especially the monsoon storms, are born from his belly (I.134.4).  Such characteristics show Vāyu’s close connection to the wind, even though he does  not represent the wind directly.
On the soma-pressing day, Vāyu is the first of the gods to receive the soma  (I.134.1, 6; VII.92.1; cf. II.11.14), which he drinks unmixed (I.134.5, VII.90.1–2).  But Vāyu also arrives with Indra on the same chariot, and the two of them share the  first drink of soma. Just how both Vāyu and Vāyu and Indra have the first drink of  soma is unclear, but, following a suggestion of Oberlies (1999: 155), perhaps Vāyu’s  first drink reflects soma’s symbolic descent through the midspace as it is filtered,  and the first drink of Vāyu and Indra is the first soma libation.
The ordinary word for the wind is vā́ta, and unlike Vāyu, the god Vāta closely  reflects the character and activity of the wind. He goes shattering and thunder ing, raising the dust; he moves through the midspace and is the companion of the  waters. The symbolic features of Vāta likewise reflect the wind. Vāta is the breath  (ātmán) of the gods (X.168.4), and as the lifebreath, he is the father, brother, and  companion of the man whom he makes live (X.186.1–3). Like the Sun and the  Dawn, therefore, Vāta, the Wind, is completely transparent to the natural phenom enon to which his name refers.
L. AŚvins
The Aśvins, the two “Horsemen,” are old Indo-Iranian or even Indo-European dei ties who have been brought into the soma rite. They are also called Nāsatyas, a  name of obscure meaning and etymology, found already in an ancient Near Eastern  Hatti-Mitanni treaty dating from the fourteenth century bce (in the form Na-ša-at ti-i̯a) and in the Avestan cognate, Nā̊ŋhaiθya. It is probably the older name of  this pair, with the lexically transparent aśvín originally an epithet. The Aśvins are  connected with honey, mádhu, and while soma comes to be called “honeyed” and  “honey,” mádhu was likely in origin a different offering to the Aśvins. They are also  connected with the Pravargya rite and the offering of gharma, hot milk. Because  they are two, the Aśvins find a place particularly in the morning soma offerings,  which are primarily dedicated to the dual divinities Indra and Vāyu and Mitra and  Varuṇa. Reflecting their association with the Morning Pressing, the Aśvins appear  in the early dawn: they come at the break of dawn (I.157.1, VII.72.4), follow the  chariot of Dawn (VIII.5.2), or accompany the dawn (X.61.4). However, they also  receive the last soma offerings in an Atirātra, or Overnight Soma Ritual. Therefore,  even if they were secondarily grafted onto the soma rite, that graft was a strong  one. They are the fourth most frequently invoked deities in the R̥gveda after Indra,  Agni, and Soma.
As “horsemen,” the Aśvins are chariot riders and drivers, rather than horse  riders. Their chariot is an object of special attention for the poets. It is often
48 The Rigveda
threefold, with three chariot-boxes, three wheels, three turnings (I.118.1–2), and  three wheel-rims (I.34.2). The sacrifice with its three soma-pressings is compared to  a chariot, so the Aśvins’ threefold chariot may represent the sacrifice. Their chariot  is also swift—“swifter than a mortal’s thought” (I.118.1) or than the wink of an  eye (VIII.73.2). Their chariot is drawn by various animals including bulls, buffa
loes, and horses, but also by birds (I.119.4), geese (IV.45.4), or falcons (I.118.4).  Their chariot flies to many places and makes the Aśvins present in many spheres: in  heaven, earth, and the sea, in the flood of heaven (VIII.26.17), among plants, and  at the peak of a mountain (VII.70.3). The Aśvins’ speed and mobility are essential  for them, for they are gods who rescue people from various dangers and difficulties  in various places and circumstances.
The story of the Aśvins that the poets mention most often is their rescue of  Bhujyu, the son of Tugra, whom his father had abandoned in the sea (e.g., I.116.3).  They also rescued Rebha from the waters, when he was bound, confined, and left for  dead (I.112.5, 116.24, 119.6). They raised up Vandana (I.118.6), although exactly  from what is not clear. They rescued Atri from an earth cleft (V.78.4) and from  threatening heat (I.112.7). They found Viṣṇāpū, who was lost, and restored him to  his father, Viśvaka (I.116.23, 117.7). They restored the youth and vigor of Cyavāna,  who had grown old (I.117.13, 118.6; VII.71.5), and of the aging Kali (X.39.8). They  brought Kamadyū, the daughter of Purumitra, to be a wife for Vimada (I.116.1,  117.20; X.39.7, 65.12) and gave a son to Vadhrimatī, a woman “whose husband is  a steer” (I.116.13, 117.24; X.39.7, 65.12). They restored the sight of R̥jrāśva, who  had been blinded by his father (I.116.16, 117.17, 18). They replaced the lost foot of  the mare Viśpalā with a metal shank (I.116.15) and made the cow of Śayu give milk  (I.116.22, 117.20, 118.8). They gave a swift, white horse to Pedu (I.116.6, X.39.10),  and they set a horse’s head on Dadhyañc, the son of Atharvan, in order for him to  reveal the honey to them (I.116.12). Not only do they arrange marriage or bring a  child to a marriage, they themselves wed or woo Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun.  While sometimes the husband of Sūryā is Soma (X.85) or Pūṣan (VI.58.4), else where she chooses the Aśvins as her husbands (I.119.5, IV.43.2, 6, VII.69.3–4) and  rides with them on their chariot (I.116.17, VIII.8.10).
What the Aśvins do has been relatively uncontroversial. Why they do it and  what is their character have been more difficult questions. Early scholars tried to  place them in the natural world: Yāska cites interpreters who understood them to  be heaven and earth, day and night, and the sun and the moon. Such interpreta
tions have been largely and rightly abandoned. Early on, Western scholars observed  their similarity and therefore possible genetic relationship to the Greek Dioskouroi.  Both pairs ride or drive horses; both are young men (kou͂roi in Greek, yúvānā in  Sanskrit); both are sons or, in the case of the Aśvins, perhaps grandsons of Heaven  (divó nápātā); both rescue people in trouble; and both are called twins. Focusing  on the last characteristic, Zeller (1990) sought to show that the Aśvins’ acts reflect  above all the fact they are twins. So, for example, she explains their concern with  sexuality and rescue as partly due to their birth. Because they have one mother but
Introduction 49
two fathers, they themselves are endowed with a greater sexual potency, and because  one of their fathers is mortal, they are closer to humans and inclined to help them.  The circumstances of their birth are not very clear in the R̥gveda, however, and  it is not certain that they were often considered twins or that their twinship was  their central feature. Along somewhat similar lines, Oberlies (1993) suggests that  the Aśvins as dual divinities can extend between opposites. They are essentially  gods of the intermediate sphere, who facilitate movement between spheres: between  childlessness and birth, death and life, old age and youth, non-marriage and mar riage, and so forth. This is a reasonable explanation of the Aśvins, which might be  extrapolated from the R̥gvedic evidence, but it is not expressed in it.
M. Maruts
The Maruts are a troop of male gods. Though they lack individual identities, they  are quite prominent as a group: over thirty hymns are dedicated to them alone and  several more to them in conjunction with Indra, and they are frequently mentioned  elsewhere. Their character has both naturalistic and social aspects. On the one  hand, they are the embodiments of the thunderstorm, especially of the monsoon,  and many of their aspects reflect this natural phenomenon: like lightning, they are  brilliant and flashing, bedecked with ornaments and glittering weapons; like thun
der, they are excessively noisy on their wild chariot journeys, causing the earth to  shake with fear, bending the trees and even the mountain; like thunderclouds, they  are shape-shifting and sometimes clothed in gray; and they are accompanied by  floods of rain. The terror they inspire is more than balanced by the fructifying rains  they bring. All these physical aspects of the Maruts often inspire the poets to vivid  and imaginative language.
As a social phenomenon, the Maruts represent the Männerbund, an association  of young men, usually at a stage of life without significant other social ties (such as  wife and children), who band together for rampageous and warlike pursuits. The  violence of the thunderstorm is akin to the violence of these unruly age-mates, raid
ing and roistering. It is not unlikely that Vedic society contained and licensed such  groups among its young men, given the frequent warfare depicted in the R̥gveda,  and the divine Maruts provide the charter for this association and behavior.
The Maruts are not, however, entirely without social ties. Their parentage is  clear, though the manner of their birth problematic and disputed—and often  alluded to as a mystery. Their mother is a dappled cow, Pr̥śni, who can display  androgynous characteristics and behavior; their father is Rudra, and they are often  themselves referred to as Rudras. Moreover, they have a female companion, Rodasī.  When the word ródasī appears in the dual number, it refers to the two world-halves,  but as a singular (also accented rodasī́) it is the name of the Maruts’ consort, a  beautiful young woman who accompanies them on their chariot. Their normal  location in the midspace between the two world-halves is presumably responsible  for her name.
50 The Rigveda
Perhaps the Maruts’ most important companion is Indra, for whom they serve  as a sort of posse: marútvant “accompanied by the Maruts” is one of Indra’s stand ing epithets. Their major role in dynamic mythology was to provide support and  encouragement to Indra before the Vr̥tra battle, an episode also treated in Vedic  prose narratives. But, according to one of the most striking hymns in the R̥gveda,  I.165, a dialogue among Indra, the Maruts, and the seer Agastya, Indra disputed  the extent of their aid at that time. In this hymn Indra and the Maruts argue over  their respective rights to a sacrifice offered by Agastya; Indra asserts his rights in  part because he claims the Maruts abandoned him to fight Vr̥tra alone, though  elsewhere in the R̥gveda (and later) there is no doubt about their supportive role in  that combat.
This mythological contretemps has its reflection also in ritual, in fact to a rit ual change occurring during the R̥gvedic period. Although in some of the Family  Books Indra alone is the recipient of the offering at the Midday Pressing, in  Maṇḍalas III and VI, in scattered mentions elsewhere, and in the classical śrauta  ritual, the Maruts share the Midday Pressing with Indra. The tense negotiations  among Indra, the Maruts, and the sacrificer Agastya in I.165 and I.170–171 sug gest that the change in recipients of the midday oblation was a contested topic for  R̥gvedic ritualists and the inclusion of the Maruts needed and was given mythologi cal underpinning.
N. Heaven and Earth
One of the most remarkable and satisfying phrasal equations across the older  Indo-European languages is that of Vedic dyaúṣ pitā́ “father Heaven” with Greek  Zeus Pater and Latin Jupiter, thus attesting to a deified paternal Heaven for  Proto-Indo-European as well as the older daughter languages. Ironically perhaps,  the Vedic god, the meaning of whose name is still transparent and lexically addi
tive, is far less important in the Vedic pantheon than his correspondents in the  Classical languages, where the original semantics have become attenuated or have  disappeared entirely.
In the R̥gveda, Heaven as a divinity is generally paired with the female Earth,  who is frequently referred to as “mother,” with the two a complementary paren tal pair. They are normally grammatically joined in a dual dvandva compound  (dyā́vā-pr̥thivī́), and several hymns are dedicated to this couple. If Heaven and  Earth are the archetypal parents, who are their progeny? This is mentioned less  than one might expect, but in a few hymns it is clearly stated that the gods are their  children and especially the Sun. A less beneficent aspect of Heaven’s fatherhood is  found in a myth, obliquely but vividly referred to a few times in the R̥gveda (I.71.5,  8; X.61.5–7) and told more clearly in Vedic prose (though with Prajāpati substitut
ing for Heaven)—namely his rape of his own daughter.
Heaven and Earth also give shape to and encompass the cosmos, providing a  safe enclosure within which life can flourish. The separation of the two to create
Introduction 51
this space is the primal cosmogonic moment, and Indra’s accomplishment of this  separation by propping them apart is endlessly celebrated.
O. TvaṢṬar
The meaning of Tvaṣṭar’s name is fully transparent:  he is the “Fashioner,” who  “adorned all the creatures with their forms” (X.110.9) and who knows all living  things (IV.42.3). But his role is more complex than his name might imply. He is the  father of Indra (III.48.2–4, IV.18), whom Indra displaced and from whom Indra  stole the soma (III.48.4). On the other hand, Tvaṣṭar fashioned Indra’s distinc
tive weapon, the mace, for him (I.32.2, V.31.4, VI.17.10, X.48.3). Tvaṣṭar is also  sometimes called the father of Agni (III.7.4), and he is the god who has begotten  offspring (III.55.19; cf. III.4.9). His role as a father perhaps explains his close rela tionship with the Wives of the Gods (I.22.9, 161.4; II.1.5, 31.4, 36.3; VII.35.6), with  whom he is ritually joined.
P. R̥bhus
In some forms of the soma sacrifice, the three R̥bhus have a significant role as prin cipal soma recipients in the Third Pressing. But despite that role, they have a limited  presence in the R̥gveda itself. Only ten hymns are dedicated to the R̥bhus, together  with one other that invokes the R̥bhus along with Indra. Nonetheless, despite their  decidedly low profile in the R̥gveda, their principal actions emerge clearly. The  R̥bhu hymns repeatedly return to five great deeds for which the R̥bhus are famed.  They took a soma cup made by the god Tvaṣṭar and fashioned it into four cups  (III.60.2; IV.33.5, 35.2, 3, 36.4). They made a chariot, sometimes identified as the  chariot of the Aśvins (I.20.3, 111.1, 161.3; IV.33.8). They created the two fallow bay  horses of Indra (I.20.2, 111.1; III.60.2; IV.33.10, 34.9, 35.5). They fashioned a cow,  or made a cow give milk, or carved up a cow (I.20.3, 110.8, 161.7, 10; IV.33.4). And  lastly, they rejuvenated their aging parents (I.20.4, 110.8, 111.1; IV.33.3, 35.5, 36.3).  Significantly, as a result of these creative acts, the R̥bhus are said to have attained  immortality or to have become gods.
Their skillful acts are essentially priestly, and their great deeds reflect ritual acts  or, more specifically, ritual acts at the Third Pressing. The four soma cups they cre ated are the cups of the four principal soma-drinkers: Indra and the three R̥bhus.  As mentioned above, the Aśvins’ chariot can represent the sacrifice, and therefore  the chariot they made could be the sacrifice in general. The creation of the fallow  bays of Indra is reflected by a special soma offering in the Third Pressing that marks  the departure of the two horses of Indra. The cow over which they work may rep resent the soma stalks from the previous soma-pressings, which are pressed again  at the Third Pressing. The R̥bhus cause these depleted “cows” to release even more  milk, which is the soma juice. Their last deed, the rejuvenation of their parents, is  more mysterious, but it might represent the return or “rejuvenation” of the Aśvins
52 The Rigveda
at the end of the sacrifice in an Overnight rite or it could reflect the rejuvenation  of the sacrificer and his wife, since the fertility of the sacrificing couple is a theme  of the Third Pressing. For a more detailed discussion of the acts of the R̥bhus and  their meaning, see Brereton (2012).
Q. PŪṢan
Although Pūṣan is a minor god in the R̥gveda, with only eight hymns dedicated  to him alone and several more shared with more prominent divinities (Indra and  Soma), his idiosyncratic characteristics and the special diction used in his hymns  attract more than his share of attention to him. Of the bardic families, only the  Bharadvājas of Maṇḍala VI favor this god; they dedicate five hymns to him (VI.53– 56, 58) with a further one to Pūṣan and Indra (VI.57) and a significant portion of  the composite hymn VI.48; the three other hymns exclusive to him are found in  I and X.
The characteristics ascribed to him are humble and somewhat countrified: his  draft-animals are goats, his tools generally an awl and a goad, his food of choice is  porridge, and the skills he deploys for us are especially the protection of the roads  and the finding of lost articles, particularly cattle. The level of discourse is often  colloquial and lively, though he is occasionally celebrated in a register more appro
priate to loftier divinities.
One striking feature does not fit this profile: Pūṣan in several passages is said to  be the husband or consort of Sūryā, the daughter of the Sun, who is the archetypal  bride in the R̥gveda, and he is also said to be the lover of his sister and the wooer of  his mother (VI.55.4–5), though this apparent incest provokes no blame. The tangled  family relations thus alluded to are not treated in any detail, so we are left with only  tantalizing clues.
R. ViṢṆu
In the middle Vedic period, Viṣṇu became a central figure as the embodiment of the  sacrifice itself and therefore of a power that can exceed even the might of the gods.  In classical India, of course, he finds an even greater destiny. There is little sign of  those futures of Viṣṇu in the R̥gveda, since it has only a half dozen hymns dedicated  to Viṣṇu or to Indra and Viṣṇu (I.154, 155, 156; VI.69; VII.99, 100). Viṣṇu appears  alongside Indra fairly often, especially in his battle with Vr̥tra (IV.18.11, VI.20.2,  VIII.100.12), and he is also Indra’s partner and ally generally. The only acts that are  especially his are his three strides or three steps. With these strides Viṣṇu encom passes the earth, and with his third step he disappears into a realm where none  can follow (I.155.4–5). Or he enters into heaven where there is the “wellspring of  honey,” the source of soma (I.154.5), or the highest cattle-pen (III.55.10). He is  therefore the god who is wide-ranging (urugāyá) and wide-striding (urukramá). The  purpose of his strides is to create space and a place for people to live and move  (I.155.4, VI.49.13, VII.100.4). This purpose could explain Viṣṇu’s close connection
Introduction 53
with Indra in the fight with Vr̥tra, since Vr̥tra represents what confines and hinders,  and Viṣṇu’s strides what opens and frees. The strides of Viṣṇu in the R̥gveda antici pate the strides that Viṣṇu takes as Vāmana, the dwarf avatar of classical Hinduism,  and also in the middle Vedic literature Viṣṇu as the sacrifice is a dwarf (ŚB I.2.5.5).  However, there is no direct evidence that Viṣṇu already has the form of a dwarf in  the R̥gveda.
S. Rudra
Although Rudra, under his euphemistic epithet Śiva, “the kindly one,” has, of  course, an extraordinarily great future in classical Hinduism, in the R̥gveda he has  a very circumscribed role, with only three complete hymns dedicated to him. He  has two major and complementary characteristics:  on the one hand, he is fierce  and malevolent, with an often inexplicable anger that needs to be appeased; on  the other, he is a healer, who controls the remedies for disease. He is also, as noted  above, the father of the Maruts, who are much more prominent in our text.
T. Sarasvatīand the Rivers
Another divinity with a great future ahead but little prominence in our text is the  goddess Sarasvatī. Again the R̥gveda provides little or no evidence for her later role  as patron of learning and the arts, though a number of scholars have attempted  to find it. Instead she is celebrated, in the three hymns dedicated to her and in  other mentions in the text, simply as a physical river with a powerful flow, which is  sometimes destructive but which also provides fecundity with its fructifying waters.  Other rivers are also praised in the R̥gveda, especially the Sindhu in a hymn dedi
cated to the rivers in general.
U. VĀc “Speech”
One last goddess should be mentioned, Vāc or deified Speech (a noun with feminine  gender). Although this goddess figures in a number of mythological narratives in  the middle Vedic period, and although she ultimately seems to have become con flated with Sarasvatī, thus amplifying the status of both goddesses, in the R̥gveda  she appears as a clear personage very rarely, most prominently in a late hymn  (X.125), which is a 1st-person self-praise (ātmastuti) spoken by Vāc herself.
VI. R̥gvedic People and Society
A. R̥gveda as History
A number of scholars have treated the question of the historical background of the  R̥gveda and to what extent we can extract historical information from the names  of kings and peoples, the events they are depicted as participating in, and the place54 The Rigveda
names where these events are depicted as occurring or where the kings and their  retinues are depicted as living. We do not intend to enter into these issues and will  simply make global reference to the many works of Michael Witzel (e.g., Witzel  1995a, 1995b), who has been especially active in discussing these questions in recent  decades.
We will only note here that the R̥gveda contains a large number of certain or  likely personal names (see Mayrhofer 2003). Besides the poets and their ancestors,  many of the names belong to royal patrons and are therefore especially common  in dānastutis. Some kings have a presence outside of dānastutis, however; particu
larly noteworthy are the Tr̥tsu or Bharata King Sudās (“Good Giver”), the victor  in the famous Battle of the Ten Kings treated in VII.18, whose forces also crossed  a formidable barrier of rivers, as depicted in the dialogue hymn III.33, and King  Trasadasyu, whose Royal Consecration may form the subject of the dialogue hymn  IV.42. Others belong to human enemies of the poet and his group, whose defeat the  gods (generally Indra) aid our side in effecting, or to clients of various gods, espe
cially the Aśvins, who receive help from these divine patrons. Needless to say, the  “reality” of those named, especially in the last two groups, cannot be ascertained.
B. Āryas, DĀsas, and Dasyus
The people of the R̥gveda refer to themselves as Āryas, which probably meant the  “civilized” ones or something similar. Under this term they define their own group  as the people who sacrifice to the gods, who adhere to Vedic customs, who speak  Indo-Aryan languages, and who in other ways identify themselves with Vedic cul
ture. They also refer to themselves as mā́nuṣa and mānavá, the “sons of Manu” or  the “peoples of Manu,” for the legendary Manu (mánu simply means “man”) was  the one who first instituted the sacrifice and was therefore the founder of Vedic  religious culture. They also called themselves the “five peoples” (páñca jánāḥ,  carṣaṇáyaḥ, or kr̥ṣṭáyaḥ), who lived in the “five directions” (páñca pradíśaḥ)—the  cardinal directions and the center—or in the five lands (páñca bhū́mā; cf. Proferes  2007: 62). Corresponding to this world of five peoples in five lands, the R̥gveda also  mentions five major Ārya tribes or tribal federations—the Pūru, Yadu, Turvaśa,  Anu, and Druhyu—who can, at one time or another, be allies or enemies of each  other. Even these major tribes may not have been stable social units, and they are  not the only social groupings mentioned in the R̥gveda. Including the major tribes,  Witzel (1995a:  313)  lists around thirty social groups named in the R̥gveda, but  notes that it is not clear which of these were extended families or clans or tribes or  confederations.
The primary social units that made up larger tribal units were the víś. There has  been much discussion about how to characterize the víś (cf. Proferes 2007: 15–16).  Generally speaking, scholars either see the víś as a “clan,” which was composed  of related lineages, or a “settlement” of a kinship group. The former emphasizes  the perceived relation of the people belonging to the víś; the latter, their shared
Introduction 55
locality. We have translated víś as “clan,” although our primary intention has not  been to adjudicate between these two views but to find a consistent translation. The  head of the clan was the viśpáti, the “clanlord,” who led his clan and represented  it within larger social units, such as a tribe. The clan was itself composed of dif
ferent extended families, themselves led by a gr̥hápati or dámpati, a “houselord.”  Sacrificers generally came from the ranks of these clanlords and houselords. Larger  social units composed of several clans were led by a rā́jan, a “king” or, as others  prefer, a “chieftain,” who was chosen from among the viśpatis by the viśpatis of the  clans that formed these units. These groups of clans then formed parts of larger  tribes or confederations, also led by a king. The R̥gvedic saṃrā́j or “sovereign king”  was likely a king whose rule included other social units that also had their kings.  The saṃrā́j was differentiated from the svarā́j “independent king,” who ruled with out interference from other lesser or greater rulers. While there is good reason and  good evidence to believe that kings were selected by clanlords or lesser kings, there  is also evidence for the lineal descent of kings, at least of the kings of major tribal  confederations (cf. Witzel 1995a: 330, 336).
The nature of a king’s rule was also affected by cycles of settlement patterns.  Periods of fixed settlement (kṣéma) alternated with periods of movement (yóga,  lit. “yoking up”). During the former the clans tended their cattle and raised crops,  more or less in peace, in more or less fixed habitations. During the latter they trav
eled into new areas to gain new lands or to take cattle from other clans or tribes,  or they confronted others moving into their territories. These two periods of settle ment and movement may have been fixed according to the seasons of the year. In  periods of mobilization the clans were governed by a king who could lead them in  battle. This king was an embodiment of Indra, a war-king, a svarā́j, who required  obedience from his subjects. During times of settlement the king was an embodi ment of Varuṇa or of Mitra and Varuṇa, who maintained the peace among his  people. He could be a saṃrā́j, who ruled, perhaps more loosely, over other rulers.  The “war-king” and the “peace-king” might have been two different people, but  more likely these represent two roles that a king might or must play. According to  our understanding, in IV.42 King Trasadasyu is both Indra and Varuṇa, the king  both in war and in peace.
The Āryas fought among themselves, but their enemies were often groups  of non-Āryas, called Dāsas or Dasyus, who may, or may not, have been  non-Indo-Aryans. The opposition between Āryas and Dāsas or Dasyus was not  an unbridgeable divide. There are many people, clans, and tribes in the Veda who  have names without likely Indo-European derivation. Witzel (1999: 359–60) gives  a “fairly comprehensive list” of Vedic “tribal and (some) clan names” that includes  names from the R̥gveda. Of these he counts twenty-two that are non-Indo-Aryan  names. The evidence is rough, but it suggests that at some point in their histories  these people had adopted Vedic culture and had become part of the Ārya com munity. The distinction between Āryas and Dāsas or Dasyus, therefore, was essen
tially a cultural and political one. The Dāsas and Dasyus were people who had
56 The Rigveda
not adopted or not yet adopted the customs and behaviors of the R̥gvedic Āryas  and therefore were not part of the Ārya community. Exactly who the Dāsas and  Dasyus were—as opposed to who they were not—is a more difficult problem. They  must have been people and cultures either indigenous to South Asia or already in  South Asia—from wherever or whenever they may have come—when the carri
ers of R̥gvedic culture and religion moved into and through the northwest of the  subcontinent.
According to the evidence of the R̥gveda the Dasyus are regularly the enemies of  the Āryas, and the poets repeatedly ask the gods’ help against them. R̥gveda X.22.8  lays out the character of the Dasyu according to the R̥gvedic poets. He is akarmán “of non-deeds,” that is, he does not perform the sacrificial rites. He is amantú “of  non-thought” because he does not know the truths formulated in the Vedic hymns  and therefore is unable to articulate these truths. He is anyávrata, one “whose com mandments are other” than the commandments of the gods. And he is ámānuṣa “no son of Manu” and therefore one who does not belong to the Vedic peoples. The  Dasyus are not only other than the Āryas, they are hostile to the Āryas. The poets  accuse them of having cunning tricks or wiles (māyā́, IV.16.9, VIII.14.14, X.73.5)  that they use against the Āryas, and they call on the gods, especially Indra but also  Agni and Soma, to strike the Dasyus down (VI.29.6), drive them off (V.31.7), or  blow them away (I.33.9, X.55.8). Such Dasyus are human, although some of them  may have been demonized humans or beings on the way to becoming demons.
There is a great degree of overlap between Dasyus and Dāsas, since both names  can be used of the same beings (I.103.3, IV.28.4, V.30.9). Like the Dasyus, the  Dāsas are also humans and usually they are enemies of the Āryas. Indra destroys  them (IV.30.15, 21;VI.20.10, 47.21, X.120.2) and their fortresses (II.20.7, IV.32.10).  However, the use of Dāsa in the R̥gveda is more complex than that of Dasyu.  Since the greatest enemy of Indra, Vr̥tra, is a Dāsa (I.32.11, II.11.2, IV.18.9) but  not a Dasyu, the Dāsas apparently penetrated further into the nonhuman realm  as demonic beings. Such a nonhuman Dāsa occurs also in X.99.6, where Indra  “subdued the mightily roaring Dāsa with his six eyes and three heads.” However,  dāsá can mean “servant, slave” already in some R̥gvedic passages. According to  VIII.56.3, a man named Dasyave Vr̥ka, “Wolf to the Dasyu,” has given to the poet  “a hundred donkeys,” “a hundred wooly ewes, a hundred slaves (dāsá), and garlands  beyond that” (cf. also VII.86.7, X.62.10). These dāsás were obviously not enemies  of the Āryas, at least not as long as they were subordinate to them. The R̥gveda also  shows less insistence on the Dāsas’ cultural difference from the Āryas than on the  Dasyus’—Dāsas are not described as akarmán, amantú, anyávrata, ámānuṣa, and  the like. However, the poets sharply distinguish between Āryas and Dāsas (V.34.6,  VI.25.2, X.86.19) and worry that the Dāsas have wealth that should belong to Āryas  (II.12.4). Yet they also can have ties to the Āryas. In VIII.46.32, a dānastuti verse,  the poet mentions a wealthy Dāsa named Balbūtha Tarukṣa, from whom he says  he received a hundred camels. Although Balbūtha’s name is not Indo-Aryan and  although he is called a Dāsa, he had apparently employed the poet, presumably to
Introduction 57
compose hymns and to sacrifice for him. Therefore, he must have had one foot in  Ārya culture, if not quite in the Ārya community.
In summary, the Dasyus and Dāsas are overlapping categories of peoples  opposed to the Āryas, and the poets call on the gods to defeat them for the sake  of the Āryas. However, sometimes Dāsas may have been rivals to the Āryas or may  even have been at the fringes the Ārya community rather than inevitable enemies of  Āryas. For a thorough discussion of the attestions of dásyu, dāsá, and dā́sa in the  R̥gveda and later Vedas, see Hale (1986: 146–69). The above summary is very much  indebted to Hale’s work, but Hale is inclined to see a racial distinction between the  Āryas and the Dasyus or Dāsa that is not justified by the evidence.
C. Social and Political Organization
The R̥gveda is the product of an elite segment of society, and it no doubt reflects  only a small part of even elite religious life. For example, the life-cycle rituals that  are so important in the late Vedic period, chronicled in the gr̥hya sūtras, are only  tangentially treated in the R̥gveda, and we get only glimpses of the dharmic pre
scriptions that later ordered daily life, as preserved in the dharma sūtras of the  late Vedic period and the dharma śāstras that followed them. The religious beliefs  and practices of the non-elite are completely absent from the text, except perhaps  in obscure and slighting references to practices that do not conform to R̥gvedic  standards.
Outside of the religious sphere we have almost no direct evidence of social or  political organization and very little information about how people, ordinary or  elite, spent their days. We learn a little about the various trades plied by members  of society, mostly by way of incidental similes or poetic images. Most of what we  learn in this sphere is about stock-raising, since the cow and the bull are both such  powerful symbols in the poetry. We also learn a bit about the leisure pursuits of the  elite, especially dicing and horse racing.
All of this is to say that it is unwise to use the evidence of the hymns uncriti cally to speculate on Vedic society. Not only does the text concern a very small  percentage of the population, but even in that population its focus is very narrow.  Moreover, everything we learn is shaped by the pragmatic purpose of the hymns as  well as by the poetic sensibilities of their composers. Nonetheless, we can venture  some very general remarks about social organization.
There is no evidence in the R̥gveda for an elaborate, much-subdivided, and over arching caste system such as pertains in classical Hinduism. There is some evidence  in the late R̥gveda for the fourfold division of society into varṇas, the large social  classes so prominent in the later legal texts. But even this system seems to be embry onic in the R̥gveda and, both then and later, a social ideal rather than a social real ity. The clearest evidence for it is found in the so-called Puruṣasūkta or “Hymn of  the Man” (X.90), in which the body parts of the Ur-man correspond to the four  varṇas, hierarchically arranged (vs. 12): the brahmin is his mouth, the kṣatriya (there
58 The Rigveda
called rājanya) his arms, the vaiśya his thighs, and the śūdra is produced from his  feet. But this hymn is generally considered to have been a quite late addition to the  text, perhaps to provide a charter myth for the varṇa system after it had taken more  definite shape. Otherwise, the late R̥gveda provides some evidence for the begin
nings of a formal contrast between brahmaṇic and kṣatriyan powers; for example,  in the final verses of VIII.36 and VIII.37, which are identical save for bráhmāṇi “priestly formulations” in VIII.36.7 and kṣatrā́ṇi “lordly powers” in VIII.37.7; the  hymn preceding this pair contains a tr̥ca (VIII.35.16–18), in which each of the three  verses calls for blessings appropriate to one of the three upper varṇas (though they  are not named as such).
The rest of the R̥gveda does attest to a division of labor and complementary and  reciprocal relationship between rā́jan “kings” (whatever form this kingship took at  this period) and the poets and priests who performed their sacrifices and composed  the accompanying poetry (as well as the secular royal encomia whose existence we  can posit though we have no direct evidence for them [see Jamison 2007: chap. 4,  esp. 146–48]). This poet–patron relationship is especially on view in the dānastutis  that were already discussed above. The status and pursuits of the “producers” or  vaiśyas are barely and glancingly alluded to in the text, primarily in similes and  the like.
We might here spare a few words for the creatures who are otherwise invisible in  the social and political structures, namely women. As is quite common for ancient  societies, we don’t know much, but the few female figures that appear in the text  tend to be quite vivid. Given their general absence from the R̥gveda, females appear  disproportionately as speakers in dialogue hymns—both divine and semi-divine fig
ures such as Indrāṇī, wife of Indra (X.86) and the Apsaras Urvaśī, once married to  the mortal Purūravas (X.95), or human or semi-human women such as Lopāmudrā,  wife of the legendary seer Agastya (I.179), or Yamī, the first (almost) mortal with  her twin Yama (X.10). The females in these hymns are quite outspoken, usually  about sex, and their male conversation partners tend to look weak and helpless in  comparison. For possible linguistic features of women’s speech as represented in the  R̥gveda, see Jamison (2008a, 2009b, 2009c).
But none of these female speakers is depicted as a real, contemporary woman,  and what we know of that class is extremely limited. Beautiful sexy women are  sometimes recorded by the poet as a particularly appealing feature of the gift cel ebrated in his dānastuti, and Dawn is often compared to everyday women—either  good, eager wives or not-so-good, eager courtesans. One must make allowance for  male fantasy at this period, as in so many others. Mothers are tenderly described,  but in generic fashion, and we also learn something about the contracting and sol emnizing of marriage, both in the wedding hymn (X.85) and in the numerous men tions of the wedding of Sūryā, daughter of the Sun, which appears to have been  of a Svayaṃvara (“self-choice”) type, familiar from later Sanskrit literature, par ticularly the weddings of Damayantī and Nala and of Draupadī and the Paṇḍava  brothers in the Mahābhārata.
Introduction 59
The Anukramaṇī attributes a few hymns to females, for example XIII.91 to Apālā Ātreyī and X.39–40 to Ghoṣā Kākṣīvatī, but these ascriptions are derived from the  personnel depicted in the hymn itself. There is no reason to assume that the poet  was female in these cases. A particularly egregious example is the attribution of the  very interesting X.109 to Juhū Brahmajāyā, or “Sacrificial Ladle, Wife of Brahma [/ the brahmin],” based on the appearance of both those terms in the text.
Although there is no real evidence for female poets, there is evidence in the late  R̥gveda for women in a ritual role, that is, as Sacrificer’s Wife (patnī). This is a standard  and required role in the classical śrauta ritual of the middle Vedic period (discussed  extensively in Jamison 1996a), and it appears to be a ritual innovation, much dis
puted, in the late R̥gveda (see discussion in Jamison 2011 and forthcoming a and b).
VII. Language and Poetics
A. Grammatical Structure and Language Use
Sanskrit is an inflectional language with an especially rich morphology, and most of  the grammatical information that is carried in English by word order and by separate  elements such as prepositions and auxiliary verbs is coded in Sanskrit on the word  itself. R̥gvedic poets glory in their grammar and are skillful in exploiting not only the  many distinctions it provides but also grammatical ambiguities and neutralizations  of grammatical distinctions. Moreover, since basic information, such as the identity  of the grammatical subject and object, is coded on the word, the poet is free to use  word order for rhetorical purposes, placing particularly significant words in emphatic  positions such as initial in the verse line. When possible, we have tried to reproduce  these effects, but all too often, given the very different structure of English, the result  of a well-intentioned effort to follow the Sanskrit word order is at best awkward and  artificial, and at worst unintelligible. This is discussed further in section VIII below.
Even the briefest sketch of Vedic grammar would be out of place here. We refer  the interested reader to Jamison (2004b) for a very skeletal account and to any  standard Sanskrit reference grammar for more details. Macdonell’s Vedic Grammar  for Students (Macdonell 1916)  is admirably clear and informative, and the clas
sic Sanskrit reference grammar is Whitney (1889). However, in some of the hymn  introductions we do make reference to certain grammatical facts, and some of these  we will mention here. The Sanskrit noun has eight grammatical cases, expressing  most of the syntactic relations pertaining in a sentence, including subject (nomi
native case), direct object (accusative case), possessor (genitive case), and so on.  The noun also has three numbers, singular, dual, and plural, and three genders,  masculine, feminine, and neuter. The verb is even more complex. Its basic unit is  a nine-member grid of three persons (1st [I/we], 2nd [you], 3rd [he, she, it, they])  and three numbers (matching those of the noun) of the subject of the verb form  (Table I.1).
60 The Rigveda
Table I.1. Sanskrit Verb Forms.
I we two we (all)
you (sg.) [“thou”] you two you (all)
he, she, it they two they (all)
This basic unit is deployed in a plethora of tenses and moods, including at least  three ways to express the past tense (the imperfect, aorist, and perfect tenses). Of  these three, the aorist is often used to express the immediate past (in English, “has  [just] done” vs. “did”) and is therefore frequently encountered in ritual situations,  in which the poet announces a sacrificial act as just completed (like the kindling  of the fire) or a poem just composed. The verbal system also has a special cat
egory called the injunctive, which has no formal marking for tense or mood and  therefore can be employed in a variety of functions—an ambiguity that the poets  often exploit.
Such is the structure of the language in general. We should now consider how  the poets utilized their language and what stylistic choices they made among the  many possibilities afforded them by the grammar. We should first remark that  the language we encounter in the R̥gveda was almost surely not the standard  everyday idiom of the poets themselves. Instead, they composed in a deliberately  archaic and deliberately elevated register appropriate to the poetic tradition they  belonged to and the solemn nature and high sacred purpose of their hymns.  Such reaching for the archaic and the elevated is common across religious tradi tions; one need only glance at modern prayer books and liturgies, even those  supposedly updated to reflect contemporary language, to encounter the same  phenomenon. The problem with regard to the R̥gveda is, of course, that we pos
sess no control sample of the “standard everyday” language of the poets, though  occasional forays into a lower register as well as phonological and morphologi cal forms embedded in the text that show developments characteristic of later  forms of Sanskrit and Middle Indo-Aryan give us some hints of what everyday  language might have been, and the language of the only slightly later text, the  Atharvaveda, may be closer (though certainly not identical) to what the poets  spoke “at home.”
Although most of the R̥gveda is couched in very-high-register language, the  poets sometimes, sometimes quite abruptly, slip into what appears to be a collo quial, even slangy, register—a switch that almost always has a dramatic purpose.  These passages are especially found in dānastutis, which are often filled with puns,  often obscene, and obscure terms, and characterized by “popular” phonological  and morphological forms. When women’s speech is represented in the text, it also  appears to belong to a lower register, and the technical terms of Vedic pastimes  like dicing and horse-racing and occupations like stockbreeding and agriculture  introduce us to lexical levels different from the high style of praise poetry and again<br>
Introduction 61
presumably closer to ordinary language. Not surprisingly, it is harder to determine  the meaning and reference of the words in these low-register passages than those  in the elevated discourse that generally prevails in the R̥gveda, and many of our  translations of such passages are provisional. Insofar as possible we have tried to  signal the change in register by using more idiomatic and slangy English. (Needless  to say, our translations of these parts will soon be dated. Such is the fate of slang,  both now and in antiquity.) For further discussion of low register in the text, see  Jamison (2008a, 2009b, 2009c).
The poets’ manipulation of language was not limited to change of register. The  most significant and salient feature of the poets’ relationship to language is their  deliberate pursuit of obscurity and complexity. The strong privileging of obscurity  is found in all aspects of R̥gvedic poetry, and we will mention only a few aspects  here. To begin with mythology, the poets seldom (we would venture to say never)  relate a myth fully and in chronological order; instead they shatter the narrative line  by ignoring chronology, omitting key plot elements, and obsessively focusing on a  few moments, alluding briefly and obliquely to the myth and deliberately failing  to identify the actors in the myth. The same is true for ritual: well-known steps in  ritual procedure (like the kindling of the fire or the mixing of soma with milk) are  shrouded in metaphor and figurative language and do not always appear in their  ritual order. The fondness for riddles and enigmas, to be discussed below, places the  puzzle-to-be-solved at the heart of the intellectual and poetic enterprise.
And so it is also with their use of language. The poets push their syntax to  the limits of intelligibility (and, at least for us, sometimes beyond) by permuta tions of word order, radically breaking up constituents and scattering their words  through a verse, omitting key constituents (like the direct object or even the verb),  and violating expected case frames and other grammatical conventions. They  delight in confecting variant morphological forms, and the vocabulary they use is  simply enormous relative to the size of the text: Grassmann’s lexicon of the R̥gveda  is a very fat volume, with 1685 pages of lemmata—a giant word-hoard, full of  rarities and hapax legomena, slang and colloquialisms. Determining the mean
ing and reference of R̥gvedic words has always been one of the greatest challenges  in Vedic studies, going all the way back to the indigenous lexicographer Yāska in  the mid-first millennium bce. Even words that are continued into later Sanskrit  often have radically different values in the R̥gveda from their later representatives.  (Especially cogent examples are the resonant terms dharma(n) and brahma(n),  which cannot be read with their later values.) But many words simply do not  appear in later Sanskrit or in Middle-Indo-Aryan. Much help is given by cognates  in other Indo-European languages, especially closely related Avestan, and from  Indo-Iranian and Indo-European root etymologies. But of course cognates and  root etymologies are not always a reliable guide to synchronic semantics, as mean ing changes over time and space, and some words are simply isolated, attested only  once (the technical term for this is hapax, or more fully hapax legomenon) or only  a few times in non-diagnostic contexts. We have often signaled such words in the
62 The Rigveda
introductions to individual hymns, although we generally give at least a provisional  translation. Again, the poets clearly revel in their lexical riches, employing what  seem like dozens of synonyms and near-synonyms for key concepts (like “shine” or  “sing”) and seeking out rarities and archaisms.
Why is obscurity so highly prized in the R̥gvedic aesthetic? On the conceptual  level it has to do with the audience—or the most important members of the audi ence—as well as the target of the composition, namely the gods. The aim of the  poets is to praise the gods at the sacrifice. But it can’t be just any praise, tired repeti tions of already hackneyed formulae—for the gods are connoisseurs. They of course  already know their own fine qualities and formidable deeds, and they have attended  countless sacrifices where these have been recounted. In order to ensure that the  gods will come, and keep coming, to our sacrifice, not that of some competing sac rificer, we have to trick out the same underlying material—“you are great, and your  deeds and gifts are great”—in ever novel fashion, with imagery and turns of phrase  to embellish and transform the same underlying message. For, as prose texts not too  much later than the R̥gveda regularly say, “the gods love the obscure” (or literally,  what is “out of sight”). Thus it is the gods’ taste for the recondite that shapes the  humans’ poetic products. The poets regularly boast that they are producing “a new  hymn”—for example, in the felicitous phrasing of III.31.19, “I make new (the hymn)  born of old” (návyaṃ kr̥ṇomi&hellip;purājā́m). This statement indirectly draws attention  to another reason for the prizing of obscurity: the poets are working in an old tradi tion, and each poet takes pride in making something new using inherited techniques.
It is the “born of old” feature that gives the answer to a question we have only  implicitly posed: if the poets are pushing their language to the very limits, how can  it be intelligible? It is because of the very stereotyped and limited nature of the sub ject matter and the shared universe of discourse among the poets, the human audi ence, and the putative divine audience. Everyone knows the great deeds of Indra  or the step-by-step procedure for purifying the soma juice, and they can recognize  their plain outlines under the fancy-dress embellishments and recherché conceits  in which the poet has clothed them. The audience can complete a truncated phrase  with the proper missing word because the full phrase is always in their heads. They  can unscramble the syntax and rechronologize the narrative and identify the mythic  actors indicated only by masking pronouns. A wider range of poetic subjects would  in fact have constrained the poets’ verbal exuberance, because they could not so  fully have relied on the unconsciously shared background knowledge of their hear ers. For us this background knowledge is hard and consciously won and will be  forever incomplete, but we must try to read the poems with an awareness of the  performance context in which they would have been received.
B. Hymn Types and Structuring Devices
There is no single, universally applicable template to which all, or even most,  R̥gvedic hymns conform. At best we can state the uselessly vague obvious: most
Introduction 63
hymns praise a god or gods, often with reference to their attributes and deeds, and  explicitly or implicitly request goods and services from the divinities in return for  this praise. This exchange is often effected during the sacrifice at which we hope they  are present, either because they are part of the sacrificial paraphernalia (like Agni  and Soma) or have come as invited guests. Within these extremely loose param
eters, the poets take many different approaches, often emphasizing one element  of the overall program while backgrounding or ignoring others. Indeed sometimes  even the “praise” portion of the overall genre “praise hymn” seems to have been  entirely elided. Because of the multifarious nature of the hymns, we have provided  an introduction to each individual hymn, describing its particular preoccupations  and structures and its particular deployment of shared tropes and themes. In what  follows here, we will first just pick out a few especially common tropes that can  dominate single hymns—this is a representative, not exhaustive selection. We will  then discuss formal devices that provide structure to whole hymns. Our underlying  assumption throughout is that hymns should be approached as hymns, not as mere  unordered collections of loosely linked verses, and that it behooves the investiga tor to seek structure and coherence even when the hymn seems on the surface to  lack them.
In hymns that do roughly conform to the sacrificial model just outlined, we  can single out two salient aspects, which sometimes carry all or most of an entire  hymn: the invitation and the journey. Many hymns begin with an invitation to the  god to come to our sacrifice, and some hymns make this invitation the focus of the  whole. Many other hymns focus on the god’s journey to the sacrifice (e.g., VII.24)— the hitching up of horses and chariot, the progress from heaven through the mid
space and across the earth, often passing over other sacrificers on the way (see, e.g.,  III.35). The epiphany of the god, his arrival at our ritual ground, can be the climax  of the hymn (for a superb example of this genre, see the Marut hymn I.88). Not  surprisingly, the invitation and the journey are often combined in a single hymn.
The progress through the sacrifice, itself a kind of journey, is also a frequent  organizational device. Sometimes this organization is quite precise, as in the  hymns that follow an ordered series of oblations, like the Praügaśastra (I.2–3), the  R̥tugrahas (I.15, II.36–37), or, especially, the Āprī litany of the Animal Sacrifice, ten  versions of which are found scattered through the R̥gveda. More often the ritual  progress is less formalized—for instance, the dawn sacrifice, first signaled by the  approach of the goddess Dawn, the rising of the sun, and the kindling of the ritual  fire, followed by the arrival of the gods who receive the offerings at the Morning  Pressing, especially Vāyu, Indra, and the Aśvins, and the distribution of the priestly  gifts or dakṣiṇās (see, e.g., VII.78).
A favored verbal conundrum, the riddle, not infrequently furnishes the subject  matter for whole hymns, in which each verse provides a puzzle, to which the answer  may or may not be given within the verse itself. The most famous example of this is  I.164, an All God hymn frequently referred to as “the riddle hymn,” but many other  hymns have the same basic structure—for example, “the weapon hymn” (VI.75)64 The Rigveda
and the delightful All God hymn VIII.29. Numerology is often an important part  of these riddle hymns. Riddle hymns are generally formally structured as lists (see  below).
A number of hymns, especially, although not exclusively, late hymns, reflect on  the nature or performance of the ritual and the functions of poets and priests.  The Puruṣasūkta just mentioned anticipates the interpretations of the sacrifice in  the Brāhmaṇas, for the “man” whose parts become the world represents the sacri
ficial offering (X.90.6) or the sacrifice itself (cf. X.90.7). A few hymns (e.g., IV.5,  VI.9) take as their subject the poet’s meditation on the craft of poetry and on his  acquisition of it, and R̥gveda X.129 links the creativity of poets to the creation  of the world. Again anticipating comparable discussion in the Brāhmaṇas, still  other hymns enter into debates about the performance of the sacrifice. In telling the  story of Agastya, the Maruts, and Indra, for example, R̥igveda X.165, 170, and 171  appear to defend traditions that favor offering soma to both Indra and the Maruts  at the Midday Pressing instead of to Indra alone as some traditions held. Likewise,  R̥igveda X.109 provides justification for including the Sacrificer’s Wife in the sacri ficial performance and thereby defends against critics of her inclusion, such as the  poet of VIII.33. Although later employed in the ritual, such hymns apparently had  a meta-ritual function and were probably composed for an extra-ritual context.
Another famous category of R̥gvedic hymns is the dialogue or ākhyāna type,  already mentioned above, in which two or more speakers, generally divine or  semi-divine, trade verses with each other, often in a fraught or agonistic fashion.  Generally one of the speakers is a female, and sexual tension is on display—as in  the dialogue between the legendary seer Agastya and his wife Lopāmudrā (I.179),  the twins and first humans Yama and Yamī (X.10), or the three-way discussion  among Indra, his wife Indrāṇī, and a monkey (the Vr̥ṣākapi hymn, X.86).
Such are a few of the thematic organizing principles of R̥gvedic hymns. At  least equally important are various formal means of organizing hymns or parts  of hymns. As one of us has treated this at some length in several publications (see  especially Jamison 2007: chap. 2; also 2004a, 2006), we will provide relatively brief  discussion here.
One of the simplest and most effective ways to impose structure is by repeti tion, a procedure that the poets constantly employ. It can be as straightforward as  repeating the same word (often a personal pronoun such as “you” or the name or  epithet of a god) at the beginning of every verse (e.g., forms of the 2nd sg. tvám in  II.1); Sanskrit grammar facilitates such patterned repetition because its elaborate  case system allows flexible word order, and therefore whatever their grammatical  function, key words can be positioned in initial position. The poets often introduce  complications into their repetitive schemata. Sometimes a repetitive pattern takes  awhile to become established in a hymn, with the first few verses providing several  variants that settle down into a frozen pattern somewhat later (see, e.g., I.112); con
versely, strict repetition earlier in the hymn may loosen up in the last verses (e.g.,  II.1, in its final verses 15–16). Moreover, many cases of repetition consist not of a
Introduction 65
single repeated word, but of several (such is actually the case with II.1, where the  pronoun tvám is followed by vocative agne), and the pattern may be established on  the basis of grammatical categories, not simply words (e.g., preverb pronoun&hellip; ).
Mention should also be made here of refrains. In some hymns every verse ends  with a repeated phrase, which is often the length of a full pāda (e.g., III.55), a hemis tich, or even longer (see VIII.36, in which only the first pāda of a six-pāda verse  contains new material; similarly VIII.37 and to a lesser extent VIII.35), but can be  shorter (e.g., the famous refrain of II.12 “he, o peoples, is Indra,” which occupies  the last [post-caesura] six syllables of a triṣṭubh line). Sometimes the refrain is syn tactically integrated into the verse in some parts of the hymn and not in others (e.g.,  I.96). Sometimes some or all subdivisions of the hymn have refrains; for example,  in the tr̥ca hymn VIII.12 the last four syllables of the final pāda of each verse form a  refrain, syntactically integrated in the verse, and each tr̥ca has a different refrain. (In  the translations we will generally mark refrains with a preceding dash.) A special  type of refrain is the family or clan signature: in some of the Family Books many  of the hymns (in the right meter) end with a pāda that marks the hymn as a product  of that bardic family—for instance, the Gr̥tsamada refrain of Maṇḍala II, “May we  speak loftily at the ritual distribution, in possession of good heroes,” found at the  end of most, though not all, of the trimeter hymns of that book.
In addition to repetition of a single word or phrase in every verse, or almost  every verse, repetitions can knit one verse to another in a chain, a procedure we  might call concatenative repetition. There a word or phrase from one verse will be  repeated in the next verse; then a different word from that verse will be repeated in  the following one, and so on through the hymn (see, e.g., I.85, VI.55, X.84).
As was noted above at the mention of riddles, hymns are frequently structured  as lists, with each verse representing a separate item in the list. This structural prin ciple is well suited to All God hymns, many of which treat a series of gods, one  per verse (see, e.g., VI.49). Another common application of the list model is in the  recounting of a series of divine deeds. A number of Aśvin hymns have this shape,  with each verse treating a different (and often quite obscure) rescue or kindly act  for a series of named persons (e.g., the Aśvin hymns of Kakṣīvant, I.116–119).  Many list hymns are reinforced, their list shape called attention to, by syntactic  parallelism and by repetition. For example, the famous Indra hymn II.12 consists  of a series of definitional relative clauses (“[he] who&hellip;”) recounting deeds and attri
butes of Indra, with each verse ending with a main clause refrain: sá janāsa índraḥ “he, o peoples, is Indra.” A list by itself is undramatic and has no built-in trajectory  toward climax, but the R̥gvedic poets are adept at finding ways to inject forward  momentum into the static list pattern. For example, VIII.29, already mentioned, is  a riddle hymn in which each verse refers to a different god or gods; the list builds on  increasing numbers, from “one” (six verses) to “two” (two verses) to “some” (one  verse), by way of “three” (once explicitly, once implicitly). The rising number leads  toward climax, while the strict placement of each number in second position in the  verse provides a rigid list skeleton.
66 The Rigveda
A different kind of repetition is found in the well-known and often discussed  phenomenon of ring composition (see, e.g., Watkins 1995:  33–37 and passim,  with further literature). In ring composition the beginning and end of a poem or  of a unified section therein is marked by repeating at the end, either verbatim or,  more usually in the R̥gveda, a variation on, material found at the beginning. In  the R̥gveda this generally involves the reappearance of lexical items or derivational  variants of them, or phrases with partial agreement. For example, in the Agni hymn  I.59, verse 1 contains the phrase víśve amŕ̥tāḥ “all the immortals” while the last  verse (7)  describes Agni with the bahuvrīhi compound viśvákr̥ṣṭiḥ “belonging to  all (human) communities.” The repetition of víśva- “all” provides the ring, and the  contrastive nouns it modifies (immortals, [human] communities) express Agni’s role  as mediator between gods and men. The word víśva- is not otherwise found in the  hymn, except in the derivative vaiśvānará, an epithet of Agni meaning “belonging  to all men,” a form of which occurs in every verse. The ring thus reinforces the mes sage implicit in the epithet. Ring composition frequently demarcates smaller seg ments in a larger hymn, and paying attention to these clues often allows us to make  structural sense of apparently sprawling hymns.
The term “ring composition” focuses attention on the beginning and end of  the section demarcated, but a particularly elaborate form of ring composition  instead defines and focuses on the center of the section. We call this the “ompha los” (navel) structure (see Jamison 2004a as well as 2007: 80–89). Here a series of  concentric outer and inner rings isolate the middle verse or verses, which contain  the mystery or the message of the hymn and are often phrased in mystical and  complex fashion. Good examples of omphalos hymns include the famous cos mogonic hymn X.129 (see Brereton 1999), enigmatic compositions like I.105 and  X.28, dramatic presentations like the Vasiṣṭha-Varuṇa hymn VII.86, and hymns  like VII.76 whose content is relatively conventional but which nonetheless show  formal omphalos structure. Omphalos structure is also prominent in the Old  Avestan Gāthās and has been more discussed there (though not by that term)  than the corresponding phenomenon in the R̥gveda (see Jamison 2007: 86–89 with  references).
We might make brief mention here of initial and final verses as especially privi leged sites in the architecture of a hymn, though they are not “structuring devices”  per se. The first verse often poses a problem or sets the theme that the rest of the  hymn will seek to work out. Probably the most famous Indra hymn, I.32, begins  índrasya nú vīryā̀ni prá vocam “Now I shall proclaim the heroic deeds of Indra,”  after which the poet does just that—though it must be admitted that he only relates  one of them, the Vr̥tra battle. Final verses can be of two types, integral to the hymn  or extra-hymnic. The latter includes the clan refrains discussed above. A different  type of extra-hymnic verse is what we might call the meta-summary. The poet often  ends his hymn with an announcement of what he has just done, often expressed in  the aorist of the immediate past and breaking the mood of immersion in the divine  world. For example, the final verse of the exquisitely crafted Indra hymn I.61, which
Introduction 67
is full of praise for Indra’s deeds and attributes, begins with the brisk hemistich,  “Thus have the Gotamas [the poet’s poetic clan] made you sacred formulations for  the ‘Fallow-bay-yoking’ (oblation),&hellip;o Indra.” The sacrifice is complete, their job  is done, and they point out their achievement to the god to spur his benevolence  as they return to the mundane world. Final verses that are integral to the body  of the hymn often subtly break patterns established earlier in the hymn to bring  the composition to a climax. Such for example is the final verse (10) of VIII.29,  a hymn mentioned several times above. Other examples are discussed in Jamison  (2007: 79–80 and passim).
One last technique to be mentioned, “poetic repair” (Jamison 2006), is not a  structuring device but a method for producing forward momentum. The poet sets  a problem—lexical, syntactic, or thematic—earlier in the hymn and then “repairs”  this problem later in the hymn by substituting the expected word, syntactic con
struction, or thematic element for the problematic one. The audience is thus first  put off-balance by a disturbance in the poetry and then rebalanced when the super ficial solecism is fixed. An audience used to this type of repair will build expecta tions that propel them through the poem.
C. Imagery, Metaphors, and Similes
The R̥gveda is rich in imagery: the procedures of sacrifice, the exploits of the gods,  the activities of men, and the elements and functioning of the cosmos are con stantly presented in images of something else, images based on similarity and paral lelism. On the formal level by far the most common way of expressing these images  is in a simile—the most common poetic device in the R̥gveda, as it is in Classical  Sanskrit poetry. Although to Indologists the dominance of the simile may seem too  predictable to be worth noting, in fact this is one of the features of R̥gvedic style  that looks forward to the classical era, and seems to represent something of a break  from the stylistic parameters of the poetic tradition from which R̥gvedic practice  emerged. The Avesta contains very few similes—none in the Old Avestan Gāthās  to which the R̥gveda is otherwise so akin—and the so-called “Homeric simile” of  ancient Greek epic, with its elaborately imagined world expressed in verb phrases,  is structurally very different from the Sanskrit simile.
Both in Vedic and in Classical Sanskrit poetry the simile is essentially nomi nal: that is, in a syntactic structure nominal elements are compared with each other,  while the verb is held constant. An English example would be “Indra attacked  the enemy, like a lion a sheep,” where the verb “attack” serves for both frame and  simile, while Indra=lion and enemy=sheep provide the comparisons. In a case lan guage like Sanskrit both “Indra” and “lion” will be coded as nominative case, and  “enemy” and “sheep” as accusative. Neither Vedic nor Classical Sanskrit regularly  has similes of the type “Indra attacked the enemy, as a lion devours a sheep,” with  two different clauses constituting the comparison and a difference in verb. The  “like” of the English example has overt expression in Sanskrit as well: by iva or ná
68 The Rigveda
in the R̥gveda, and just iva in Classical Sanskrit. For further on the structure of the  simile and the ways that R̥gvedic poets exploit it, see Jamison (1982). Although the simile is ubiquitous in the R̥gveda, it is not the only vehicle of  imagery in the text. Implicit identifications of disparate elements are another ines capable stylistic feature, and, as was discussed above, regularly recurring identifica tions (bandhus)—the fire as sun, the chariot as sacrifice, and so forth—provide the  conceptual structure of the Vedic cosmos. Thus, poetic style coincides here with  the shared notions of the world that shape “the Vedic mind.” However, in mak ing identifications the poets do not confine themselves to these shared and stable  associations, but often make bold and superficially puzzling equations. Decoding  the shared features that allow such equations to be made is one of the intellectual  challenges that the poets posed to their own audience and that engages us, and  often eludes us, to this day.
Although the poetic foundation on which the R̥gveda rests was an ancient one,  the imagery of its poems comes from the immediate world of its poets. As already  remarked, the R̥gveda is fundamentally a collection for the soma rite in which Indra  is the principal deity. Indra is a warrior, and therefore images of battle, war, con
test, and conflict provide the background for a great many R̥gvedic hymns. In the  IXth book, for example, the ritual process of creating soma can represent a war  campaign by King Soma. The dripping of soma as it is pressed is the beginning of  Soma’s attack or raid. The flow of soma over the woolen filter and into the soma  vessels is the destruction of Soma’s enemies. With the mixing of soma with milk,  Soma wins cows and other goods and distributes them to his subjects, who are the  sacrificers (cf. Oberlies 1999: 167–206).
Other items associated with war and periods of mobilization also loom large in  the poems, perhaps none more than the chariot. The chariot was one of the most  visible cultural symbols of the Āryas, for it was likely unique to them among the  peoples of ancient South Asia, and it was critical to their success in battle and their  mobility. In R̥gvedic poetry the chariot becomes the hymn that travels to the gods  or the sacrifice that brings the gods (II.18.1). When they perform the ritual or com
pose the hymns, priests become the fashioners of the chariot (I.61.4, V.2.11), and  just as a chariot brings booty from war or a winning chariot the prize of a race, the  sacrifice carries goods from the gods to humans (X.53.7). In I.129.1 Indra is asked  to lead a chariot that is both an actual, racing chariot and a metaphorical chariot,  the sacrifice. The chariot is also the vehicle of the gods, by which they come to the  sacrifice. Distinctive animals pull the chariots of different gods: the two fallow bay  horses of Indra, the dappled mares of the Maruts, the mares of the Sun, the ruddy  cattle of Dawn, the goats of Pūṣan.
More abstractly, the imagery of war is also implicit in the frequent symbols of  expansion and confinement. This imagery is most evident in the principal Indra  stories. Vr̥tra represents what hinders and blocks, and when Indra kills Vr̥tra, he  shows himself to be the power that can destroy any other obstacles to life and pros
perity. The Vala cave enclosed and entrapped the cattle, and Indra must break open
Introduction 69
Vala to free the cows, the dawns, and the light. Finding open and well-watered pas ture lands was essential for the Āryas, since their cattle, horses, and other livestock  depended on them. The second half of IX.113 is a poetic vision of heaven, where  there is “inexhaustible light” (7) and “youthfully exuberant waters” (8), where one  moves “following one’s desire” (9), and where there is “independence and satisfac tion” (10). It is the heavenly vision of a pastoral people, longing for a place of  freedom and abundance.
Pastoral imagery dominates R̥gvedic poetry at many turns. Cows are every where, especially as the symbols and substance of wealth. The attention of the gods,  which will bring rewards to humans, is a cow (II.32.3), and rain is milk from heaven  (V.63.5). In II.34.8 the Maruts are compared to a cow, since they “swell” with rain,  the way cows swell with milk. In VI.45.7 Indra, as the god who inspires poetic  formulations, is a cow whose milk is the hymns. Or again, in VIII.1.10 Indra is  both the milker of the cow and the cow whose milk is “refreshment” for sacrificers.  Speech is a cow that gives the forms of speech as her milk in VIII.110.10, and in  X.64.12 the insight that the gods have given the poet should swell like a cow with  milk. VI.48.11–13 combines several images of the cow, beginning with an actual  cow, whose milk is the milk that is mixed with soma but including also the cow that  represents poetic inspiration and prosperity. In X.133.7 prosperity brought by the  gods is a cow giving her milk “in a thousand streams.” The dawns, which are linked  with the dakṣiṇā, the sacrificial reward, and with riches more generally, are cows  (IV.1.16, 52.2–4).
While the poets have particular fondness for cows, male animals too figure signif icantly in the hymns. Bulls and buffaloes embody strength and virility, and therefore  they represent mighty gods, potent sacrifice, and strong men. Agni is a bull with a  strong neck (V.2.12), horns (V.1.8), and a powerful bellow (X.8.1). In V.40.1–4 the  bull-like pressing stone and bull-like soma are prepared so that the bull Indra will  join together with his bulls, the Maruts. Indra is “the bull overcoming the power ful, the tempestuous king, smasher of Vr̥tra, soma-drinker” (vs. 4). Parjanya, the  Thunderstorm, roars like a bull (V.83.1), has the powers of bull (vs. 2), and pours  his fertilizing streams as a “bullish stallion” (vs. 6). Indeed, anything associated with  their ideal of masculinity is likely to be bull-like for the R̥gvedic poets.
The cultural role of horses—racehorses and warhorses—was obviously central  to the Āryas and, as a result, so was their poetic role. Agni is praised like a steed  (III.22.1), for he is a horse that brings rewards (I.27.1). When he is kindled, he is  a hungry horse, which breaks free of his enclosure (VII.3.2). Soma is a racehorse  groomed by the fingers of the priests and running over the woolen filter (IX.6.3,  5; cf. 13.6). The waters too are like racehorses that should run forever (IV.3.12).  A sacrificer harnesses himself to the sacrifice like a horse (V.46.1), and the sacrifice  is brought to success like a horse (IV.10.1). The significance of the horse is perhaps  most obvious in the Dadhikrāvan hymns, IV.38–40. Dadhikrāvan was likely the  actual horse of King Trasadasyu, but Dadhikrāvan also represents the rule of the  Pūrus, the tribe to whom Trasadasyu belonged, and the sun, which can represent
70 The Rigveda
the king. Similarly, in X.178, Tārkṣya is a protective deity of chariot drivers and  perhaps a deified racehorse himself.
Although the poets are focused on pastoral life and the herd animals they  know best, wild animals also occasionally appear in R̥gvedic hymns (see Jamison  2008b). Birds are frequently mentioned (I.164.21; X.80.5, 123.6), especially since  the gods fly like birds (I.166.10). Unlike other birds, the falcon is not only fast but  also can be trained. Mythologically the falcon is particularly significant, since it  brought the soma from heaven to Manu (IX.48.4, IV.26–27). The wolf is a recur
ring symbol of lurking danger (I.42.2, 105.11, 18, 120.7; II.28.10), as is the snake  (VII.38.7). The most dangerous creature of all is Vr̥tra, who is a gigantic cobra  (I.32). More benignly, the inseparable Aśvins are compared to a pair of cakravāka ducks (II.39.3), and in I.64 the Maruts are not only bulls and buffaloes, but they  also roar like lions and devour trees like elephants. Perhaps the broadest array of  animals appears in X.28, which is built around various animal fables (also Jamison  2008b).
Various human pursuits play significant roles in poetic imagery. The poets fre quently mention weaving (e.g., I.115.4), which is similar to the intricate patterns  of hymn composition and sacrifice (VI.9.2–3, X.101.2, 130). This is an inherited  Indo-European trope. Given the pastoral symbolism elsewhere, it is not surprising  that cattle-tending is a major source of poetic imagery. Indra is like a herdsman  who separates his flocks from those of others (V.31.1; cf. VI.19.3). The poet too  can be a herdsman driving his praise to Indra (VI.49.12). Or we have the reverse  image: in VII.18.10 enemies run helter-skelter like cows without a herdsman. In  addition to animal husbandry, the Āryas also raised crops, such as barley, but agri
cultural imagery does not figure much in the R̥gvedic poetry. Again, the reason  may be the connection of the soma rite to Indra and to the period of mobiliza tion (yóga). In the period of settlement (kṣéma), agriculture would have had a  larger role.
D. Riddles
Much of the R̥gveda is enigmatic, not only because of our distance from the time  of its creation, but also because the poets meant it to be enigmatic. They valued  knowledge, especially the knowledge of the hidden connections (the bandhus dis cussed above) between the visible world, the divine world, and the realm of ritual.  They embedded that knowledge in hymns that were stylistically tight and elliptical,  expressively oblique, and lexically resonant. As a result, many hymns of the R̥gveda  can appear to us as riddles. However, there are also hymns purposefully composed  to cloak their subjects or to withhold them until late in the hymn. In the later Veda  the ability to solve the riddles they pose became a formalized demonstration of the  knowledge of the priests taking part in the sacrifice. In the R̥gveda the riddle hymns  challenged the interpretive ability of their hearers and demonstrated the cleverness  of their poets.
Introduction 71
One kind of riddle hymn is represented by V.47. Through its first six verses, it  describes various deities but does not name them. The descriptions point toward  various gods, but never so plainly that hearers could be sure of their interpretations.  At the very end of the hymn, in its last verse, the poet twists his strategy and in the  very first pāda names the gods he addresses, gods who may or may not be among  those he described earlier. The clarity of that last verse throws into greater relief  the difficulty of the preceding verses. The poet of VIII.29 uses exactly the reverse  strategy. This is a list hymn, in which each of its verses identifies a god or gods by  attributes or behavior, but not by name. In this hymn, however, the identity of the  gods it describes is not mysterious at all—or is not until the last verse. At that point,  when the confidence of hearers to interpret the hymn would be greatest, the poet  presents a real riddle, in which the identity of the subject is not at all clear. In III.55  the riddle of the identity of the gods described in its verses points toward an even  deeper mystery. This mystery is laid out in its refrain: it is that the many gods share  a single lordship (asuratvám ékam).
Other poets treat the sacrifice as a mystery. In X.114 the poet describes the con stituents of the sacrifice in symbols that make the identification of those constitu ents difficult or impossible. It leaves the sense that the sacrifice can be penetrated  only so far, that it is beyond full understanding, except, perhaps, for poets who cre ate such hymns. Another characteristic of X.114 is that each of its verses contains  a number—small numbers at the beginning (2, 3, 4, 1), larger numbers toward the  end, and an ironic plural of the word for “one,” éke “such ones,” in the last verse.  Other hymns employ numerical riddles, in which a number is key to their solution,  if there is a solution. One of the most obscure hymns in the R̥gveda is X.27. Verse  15 describes the convergence of numbered groups of heroes, none of whom are  identified. There are seven who come from the south, eight from the north, nine  from the west, and ten from the east, but we are left to puzzle about the significance  of these numbers and directions.
Perhaps the most famous riddle hymn in the R̥gveda is I.164, a very long poem  (52 verses, one of the longest hymns in the R̥gveda) that moves in different direc tions as it unfolds. The hymn makes both implicit and explicit reference to Vedic  ritual, including rites other than the soma ritual. In referring to these rites, the  hymn suggests hidden links between ritual objects and acts, realities and processes  of the natural world, and constituents and functions of the human body. These  hidden connections continue to be hidden, for while we can see the general pattern  of the hymn, the interpretation of its specific elements often remains difficult, and  many competing solutions have been offered. This is, of course, often the case with  these riddle hymns.
E. Metrics
The most conspicuous and ubiquitous formal feature of the R̥gveda is meter. The  hymns are composed in a variety of meters, but all of the meters are syllable-counting
72 The Rigveda
and quantitative. That is, they consist of lines containing a fixed number of syllables,  arranged in patterns of “heavy” and “light” syllables (the “quantity” referred to by  the term “quantitative”). Heavy syllables contain a long vowel (a class that includes  e and o) or diphthong or a short vowel followed by two consonants (which need not  belong to the same word) and are symbolized in Western analysis by a macron (¯).  Light syllables contain a short vowel followed by, at most, a single consonant and  are symbolized by a breve (˘). (Aspirated consonants [those written with two roman  letters, the second of which is h, e.g., th] count as single consonants.) The final syl lable of a line is metrically indifferent and symbolized by x. The distinction between  heavy and light metrical syllables simply formally enshrines patterns inherent in  the language itself, where various linguistic processes are sensitive to distinction  in syllable weight and the difference between short and long vowels is lexically and  morphologically crucial.
This type of metrical structure was inherited from the Indo-European poetic  tradition, most clearly evident in ancient Greek meter, especially the Aeolic meters  utilized by Sappho and Alcaeus, which are also syllable-counting and quantitative;  these Aeolic meters have long been considered cognate to Vedic meter. The meter  of the Old Avestan Gāthās is also closely akin: though the quantitative aspect has  been lost, Gāthic lines have a fixed number of syllables.
R̥gvedic meter is also identical in its structural principles to most of the meters  encountered in Epic and Classical Sanskrit (with the exception of the ārya and  related types). The major difference between Vedic meter and Classical Sanskrit  meter has to do with the regulation of quantities. In the earlier parts of the line  R̥gvedic meter has relatively unfixed quantities; it is only toward the end of a line  (the cadence) that the quantity of each syllable is fixed (especially in trimeter meter,  on which see below). By contrast, most Classical Sanskrit literary meters regulate  the quantity of each syllable in the line; in other words, the relative flexibility of  R̥gvedic meter has become frozen. The exception is the eight-syllable epic anuṣṭubh,  or so-called “śloka” meter—the overwhelmingly predominant meter in the two  great epics and the workhorse meter of non-literary Classical Sanskrit verse texts  such as Manu’s lawcode—whose quantities are precisely fixed only in the second  half of each line.
R̥gvedic meters are generally divided into “dimeter” and “trimeter” types. The  former consists of eight-syllable lines, which can be conveniently considered to con sist of two equal segments, with the second half tending more toward fixed quanti ties, generally in an iambic pattern. However, it is important to keep in mind that  there is no fixed caesura (word-break) in dimeter meter, and even the four cadential  syllables are not rigidly fixed in quantity. Trimeter meter is more complex. It gener ally consists of lines of either eleven or twelve syllables (triṣṭubh or jagatī respec tively), characterized not only by a fixed cadential sequence of four (triṣṭubh) or  five (jagatī) syllables but also by a strong caesura after the first four or five syllables  in the line. The caesura and the cadence thus effectively divide the line into three  parts—the opening (the first 4–5 syllables before the caesura), the “break” (the 2–3  syllables following the caesura), and the cadence.
Introduction 73
Examples of the three most common types of lines, dimeter, trimeter (triṣṭubh), and  trimeter (jagatī) follow, with heavy and light syllable scansion given below the text. We  have provided two examples each for the trimeter lines, one with four-syllable opening  and three-syllable break, one with five-syllable opening and two-syllable break.
Dimeter
eight-syllable dimeter
I.1.1a agním īḻe puróhitam
¯ ˘ ¯ ¯ ˘  ¯  ˘  x
Note the iambic rhythm of the last 4 syllables.
Trimeter
Trimeter cadences:
triṣtubh:  ¯ ˘ ¯ x
jagatī:  ¯ ˘ ¯ ˘ x
Note that twelve-syllable jagatī can be seen as a one-syllable extension of triṣṭubh,  with an extra light syllable inserted right before the end, resulting in a five-syllable  cadence. The structure of the rest of the line is the same.
eleven-syllable trimeter: triṣṭubh—opening of four
I.32.1a índrasya nú vīríyāṇi prá vocam
¯ ¯ ˘ ˘ | ¯ ˘ ¯ ¯  ˘  ¯  x
The obligatory caesura (word break) after the opening is marked by a slash; the  break is three syllables (¯ ˘ ¯) and is not followed by a caesura, while the cadence is  the proper triṣṭubh one (¯ ˘ ¯ x).
eleven-syllable trimeter: triṣṭubh—opening of five
I.32.1b yā́ni cakā́ra prathamā́ni vajrī́
¯ ˘ ˘ ¯ ¯ | ˘ ˘ ¯  ˘  ¯  x
Note that the rhythms of the openings of the two triṣṭubh lines are quite distinct.  Here the break is two syllables (˘ ˘), and the cadence the same as the previous line. twelve-syllable trimeter: jagatī—opening of four
II.1.16b ágne rātím upasr̥jánti sūráyaḥ
¯ ¯ ¯ ˘ | ˘ ˘ ˘ ¯ ˘  ¯  ˘  x
The opening is different from either of the triṣṭubh openings above; the break is  three shorts (˘ ˘ ˘), unlike the short/long/short (¯ ˘ ¯) three-syllable break of the  quoted triṣṭubh line. The cadence is the standard jagatī five-syllable one (¯ ˘ ¯ ˘ x).
twelve-syllable trimeter: jagatī—opening of five
II.1.16c asmā́ñ ca tā́ṃś ca prá hí néṣi vásya ā́
¯ ¯ ˘ ¯ ¯ | ˘ ˘ ¯ ˘  ¯  ˘  x74 The Rigveda
Yet another opening pattern. The two-syllable (˘ ˘) break is identical to that of the  triṣṭubh with opening of five, as shorter breaks have fewer possible patterns. The  cadence is the standard jagatī cadence. Note that though there happens to be a word  break between the break and the cadence in this line, it is not an obligatory one, and in  fact none of the other three trimeter lines quoted shows a word break at this position.
The lines just described are called pādas, a term we will employ throughout  this work. A R̥gvedic verse (r̥c) consists of a group of pādas, generally three or  four, though meters with fewer than three pādas or more than four are also found.  Lower-case roman letters are used to refer to the pādas in a verse (so, e.g., “5b” will  refer to the second pāda in the fifth verse of a hymn). Again, we will regularly use  this shorthand in identifying lines. There is another significant division within the  verse: the hemistich or half-verse. In four-pāda verses this consists of two two-pāda  units; in three-pāda verse, the first two pādas are considered the hemistich, with a  single pāda following.
The most common dimeter meter is gāyatrī, a collection of three eight-syllable  pādas. Approximately one quarter of the R̥gveda is composed in this meter. The  other common dimeter meter is anuṣṭubh, which contains four such eight-syllable  lines and is the ancestor of the Epic and Classical śloka mentioned above. The  most common trimeter meter, in fact the most common meter in the R̥gveda, is  triṣṭubh, which accounts for approximately 40% of the text. It consists of four  eleven-syllable pādas, while jagatī likewise consists of four pādas, though of twelve  syllables each. Jagatī is the third most common meter, after triṣṭubh and gāyatrī.  Besides these mono-type meters, some hymns are composed in what are referred to  in general as “mixed-lyric meters,” whose verses consist of combinations of eight and twelve-syllable pādas. There are a number of different combinations, each with  a different name. (For details, see especially the table of meters in van Nooten and  Holland 1994, referred to below.)
The details just given are not relevant only to professional metricians, for the  rhetoric and semantic structure of the R̥gveda are strongly driven and shaped by  meter. Syntactic constituents often occupy single pādas, for example, and metrical  boundaries (the beginning and end of the line, as well as the position immediately  after the caesura) are favored sites for positioning emphatic elements. The hemistich  is a particularly salient unit, dividing the verse into syntactic and semantic halves.  In fact, we have discovered that it is almost always possible, and generally desirable,  to render the hemistich division in English—that is, to translate the first half and  the second half of the verse as separate units. This is reflected in the physical layout  of our translation, with the second hemistich starting a new line. It is remarkable  how faithful it is possible to be to the Sanskrit hemistichs without significantly com promising the English. (The hemistich division is less important and more often  syntactically breached in gāyatrī, since the division results in uneven parts:  two  pādas followed by one, but even in gāyatrī the third pāda is often independent of  the first two.)
Introduction 75
The verse is the most significant unit in a R̥gvedic hymn—hence the name  R̥g-veda, or Veda of verses (r̥c). It is almost always a self-contained syntactic con struction, and even when that construction is not entirely independent syntactically  (e.g., when it is a relative clause, dependent on a main clause in a verse following or  preceding), it will be internally unified. There are almost no examples of syntactic  enjambment between verses. This focus on the internal unity and syntactic indepen dence of the verse is continued in later Sanskrit poetry, where it reaches its defining  limit in so-called muktaka verses or single-verse poems.
Nonetheless, some hymns are structured into larger groupings of two to three  verses, which are sometimes referred to as “strophes.” The tr̥ca or “triplet” is the  most common such grouping, consisting of three verses, generally in gāyatrī,  though other meters are also found. Sometimes the tr̥ca unit is strongly defined by  shared lexicon or a shared refrain, or by parallel syntactic structures, or by a com
mon theme; other tr̥cas have only the faintest signs of unity in rhetoric or content.  Quite long hymns can be built from these three-verse units, which are especially  common in Maṇḍala VIII and, as Oldenberg argued (1888: 119–40), were the spe cial province of the Udgātar (singer) priest. Many of these strophes were borrowed  into the Sāmaveda, whose principal priest in classical śrauta ritual was the Udgātar  and one of whose major textual sources is R̥igveda VIII. The other major strophic  type is the pragātha, consisting of two verses in two different types of “mixed lyric”  meters. The usual combination is br̥hatī (8 8, 12 8)  and satobr̥hatī (12 8, 12 8).  Again, pragāthas are especially common in the VIIIth Maṇḍala and frequently  taken over into the Sāmaveda. Thus the standard types of multi-verse groupings  tended to provide the lyric or sung portion of the ritual, as against the recited por
tions associated with the Hotar priest.
A brief and clear account of R̥gvedic meter is given in Macdonell (1916: appen dix II). For full details see Arnold (1905). Oldenberg’s Prolegomena (1888) is invalu able both for his detailed treatment of the meters of particular hymns and sets  of hymns and for his discussion of the historical implications of metrical details.  Van Nooten and Holland (1994) provide a hymn-by-hymn metrical commentary  in somewhat lapidary style, as well as a table of R̥gveda meters as identified in the  Anukramaṇī (pp. xiv–xvi), which should be consulted for the names and character istics of meters not explicitly discussed here.
VIII. Translation Principles
A. Sanskrit into English: Problems and Solutions
As has been repeatedly emphasized above, the R̥gveda is a poetic text, structured  by intricate meters, driven by rhetorical principles based on this metrical struc ture, and crafted by skillful poets for a poetically aware audience. Nonetheless, we  have chosen to translate the text into prose, not verse—for several reasons. First
76 The Rigveda
and perhaps most important, we are not poets, and we would dishonor the highly  trained and highly inventive poets of the R̥gveda by translating their artful cre ations into bad English verse. Moreover, the structures of the English language and  of English verse are entirely different from those of Vedic Sanskrit. Since English  lacks the elaborate morphology of Sanskrit, it is not as possible in English, with out awkwardness or, indeed, loss of sense, to use word order for rhetorical rather  than syntactic purposes. The stress-counting principle that regulates English blank  verse and the end rhyme characteristic of much English poetry are alien to R̥gvedic  poetry. Thus the English poetry that resulted from a verse translation would not<br>
replicate in any of its most salient features the structures of R̥gvedic poetry. We have, however, tried to retain the verse structure as much as possible. All the  translations reproduce the verse divisions found in the hymn, and within verses the  hemistich boundary is also always marked, with the second hemistich beginning  a new line. In fact, as noted above, it has almost always been possible to translate  hemistichs as units without breaching the boundary—an indication of how strong  a compositional element the hemistich was for the poets.
Translators who are also poets might succeed in rendering the R̥gveda (or parts  thereof) into poetry that captures the spirit and flair of the original, but such ren dering would perforce (or so we think) distort or reinvent the literal meaning of the  text. This is of course a perfectly acceptable translational strategy—some think it  is the only acceptable strategy: that a literal translation is a fundamental betrayal  of the original. But we have chosen to hew as close to what we consider the literal  meaning of the text and its constituent words as we can. The text is multivalent, and  over the millennia it has received multiple, often incompatible, interpretations. By  translating the text literally, we hope to leave the interpretive opportunities open for  the readers, inviting them to participate in the act of interpretation though provid
ing as much guidance as we can.
As was also noted above, the everyday language of the R̥gvedic poets was almost  surely not identical to the language they used in their hymn compositions. They  may well have spoken a form of early Middle Indo-Aryan—judging from some  Middle Indic phonological features found in the hymns—or at the very least a more  stripped-down form of Sanskrit, with the limitations on morphological categories  and variant forms found in middle Vedic prose and in Epic and Classical Sanskrit.  Since they were therefore composing in a deliberately archaic style, we have aimed  for a fairly formal and old-fashioned English style on both the lexical and the syn tactic levels, with occasional whiffs of the archaic. (For example, one of us often  translates the morphologically opaque archaic frozen form śám with the equally  opaque English “weal,” to capture its linguistic isolation; the other of us prefers  “luck,” which does have the advantage of conveying more sense to the modern  English reader.)
The poets were, however, quite aware of linguistic registers, and are capable of  making wrenching shifts from, for example, the high-register solemnity of most  of their production to slangy and sometimes obscene humorous banter. (See, for
Introduction 77
example, Indrāṇī’s discourse in X.86, which lurches from shockingly explicit vul garity [especially from a goddess] to the highest of high styles.) Such passages are  especially common in dānastutis. When we have been able to identify low-register  vernacular passages, we have attempted to render them into a similar English  register.
One feature where we have deliberately avoided English archaism is in the trans lation of the 2nd-person pronouns, singular versus plural (and dual)—rendering all  of them with “you,” although it would occasionally have been useful to disambigu ate between singular and plural. In part this is an English stylistic choice: a consis tent distinction between “thou/thee” and “ye/you” quickly becomes wearisome for  the reader. But it would also produce a misleadingly archaic impression; the distinc tion between the singular and plural [/dual] 2nd-person pronouns remains a feature  in Sanskrit throughout its history, and, though the dual was lost, the singular-plural  distinction was also a feature of Middle Indo-Aryan. Therefore this same distinc tion in Vedic Sanskrit carried no stylistic weight at all; it’s simply an unremarkable  feature of the grammar, and the obsolete English “thou” would distort the effect  of the text.
An area where the balancing act between R̥gvedic style and English intelligibil ity most tests the translator is in the placement of words. The R̥gvedic poet may set  a word at the beginning of a verse or hemistich to draw special attention to it, or  hold back words until the end of the verse to surprise his audience or cause them  to change their expectations about the meaning of the line. He may position identi cal or similar elements in the same place in a sequence of verses in order to build  larger rhetorical units or to emphasize the similarity of ideas in the verses, or may  scramble elements that underlyingly belong together in order to produce a mosaic  effect, whose contours only become clear over time. In short, the poet can use the  placement of words in order to unfold his ideas in a particular and deliberate way.  The freer word order that an inflected language and a shared poetic diction allow  gave the poets flexibility in arranging their verse. Our translation does not aspire to  be poetic, and our medium is the highly uninflected English language. Nonetheless,  we have been reluctant to surrender all attempts to follow the poets’ positioning of  elements, and have tried to follow the order of words and ideas as well as we can,  especially in cases where the verbal positioning seems to make a particular rhetori cal or conceptual point. The result is an English that is not quite natural. Apart  from preserving the structure of the verse and the unfolding of ideas, there are  other advantages we see in adopting this style. It reminds readers that the R̥gveda  is elevated and solemn poetry, and it signals that even for the composers and their  audience the language of the R̥gveda was not everyday speech and the expression  of ideas in the text was not designed to be direct and pellucid. A translation into  a too fluent and colloquial English would produce a very misleading impression  of the original. We hope that this style of translation will slow readers enough to  allow them to sense the style of the original, while not rendering the English too  impenetrable.
78 The Rigveda
One of the features of almost all previous translations of the text, as well as the  scholarly paraphernalia, like dictionaries, that have supported these translations, is  that the lexical range in the translation language is very narrow and tends toward  the abstract, the general, and the overlapping. It’s a standing joke among Vedicists  that all verbs mean “shine,” “sing,” “speed,” or “give”; all adjectives, “bright” or  “swift”; all nouns, “praise.” This monotony contrasts sharply with the variety and  color of the R̥gveda’s Sanskrit. As we have already noted, Grassmann’s lexicon of  the R̥gveda is enormous compared to the size of the text (there must be somewhere  in the digital world a metric for evaluating lexical diversity per text size). The “sing/  speed/shine” translational style severely flattens this lexical richness. It is as if all the  verbal exuberance of Shakespeare were squeezed into the neo-classical spareness of  a French dramatist like Racine.
This habit not only robs the translation of its verbal diversity but, perhaps more  important, of its metaphorical content. Translators are usually not semantically  wrong when they translate a verb as, say, “shine,” but they are often translating the  underlying sense of a metaphor rather than the more vivid, and often more jarring,  image evoked by a more precise word. To give a single example, there is a verbal  root √ribh that seems literally to mean “croak,” “creak,” “rasp,” “squawk”—used,  for example, of the sound of a creaky wagon, or of a crackling fire. It is also fre
quently used of poets and praise-singers, and a nominal derivative of it, rebhá, is  regularly applied to poets. But—no surprise—the standard rendering in current  translations and dictionaries is “singer”—German “Sänger”—and this certainly  correctly identifies the referent of the word. But the particular voice quality, per
haps “hoarse” or “husky,” is sacrificed to making a fluent and easily interpreted  translation—not scaring the horses, as it were, by suggesting that the singers were  anything but mellifluous.
The twentieth century saw much progress in limiting and pinpointing the mean ing of many R̥gvedic words, and in appreciating their position in linguistic register  (e.g., solemn and hieratic vs. colloquial vs. technical vs. unmarked and general).  Incorporating these results makes for a much more vivid text, but also a “spik ier” one, with unsettling or discordant images or juxapositions of concepts. To  return to the √ribh example just given, a translation like “hear the poet as he rasps”  (VIII.37.7) is more likely to take the reader aback than “hear the praise-singing  poet” (Geldner’s “den lobsingenden&hellip;”), but a simile in a passage also containing  this verb, IX.97.57 “the poets squawk like birds of prey,” supports the less easy  interpretation. In that passage Geldner’s attempt to rescue it so radically attenuates  the phrase that it becomes close to incomprehensible: “the seers become audible  like vultures” (“werden die Seher lautbar wie die Geier”).
In our translation we have aimed, again, for the literal, and sometimes discor dant, sense of the word—even if the literal sense was a dead metaphor for contem porary speakers. We have, in fact, no way to determine whether a metaphor was  dead or alive at the time of composition, and in any case, even if at the time of com position it was dead, it had been previously a metaphor with real poetic heft. On the
Introduction 79
other hand, we have not been able entirely to follow the austere and chaste principle  of Bergaigne and Thieme—to translate a particular word always in the same way,  no matter what the context. Attempts to do so often produce unintelligible English,  whereas some adjustment to context aids the reader to grasp the sense. Thus our  translation has been a balancing act between the flattening effect of rendering the  underlying sense as opposed to the literal surface and a too principled adherence to  a single literal meaning for every word regardless of context.
In representing the spikier and more difficult style that we see in the R̥gveda,  in contrast to the translation tradition that has attempted to smooth out the dif ficulties, fill in the gaps, and aim for clarity above all, at the expense of the literal  meaning and obscure style of the original, we have been aided by the sheer chance  of the age we live in. As the discussion above has repeatedly suggested, newer ways  of looking at the text have the unintended result of making the text “harder.” The  images are more striking but also more obscure; the lexicon is more specific but the  combinations of words therefore less harmonious; the ritual underpinnings cannot  be glossed over, however bizarre and “unpoetic” the actions depicted may seem. We  think the result is truer to the spirit of the text than the easy flow of older transla
tions and also truer to our age. It must have been difficult to appreciate the polished  obscurities of R̥gvedic verse before the twentieth century enshrined deliberate dif ficulty in poetry as a preeminent sign of serious verbal art. So Ezra Pound and  T. S. Eliot begat our poets Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra, in a paradoxical reversal of the  paternal relationship that a R̥gvedic bard would relish.
Stylistically the R̥gveda is a dense and compact text. This results from at least  two factors. On the one hand, the elaborate morphology of Sanskrit allows a  parsimony of words, as opposed to the diffuse nature of a language like English.  To choose one example, this from the Atharvaveda (III.20.8):  the two-word  clause áditsantaṃ dāpayatu necessarily translates into at least eleven English  words:  “Let him cause the man not wishing to give to give.” There is no way  to reproduce the verbal spareness of Sanskrit in a language like English, which  needs a plethora of function words to render the less assertive moving parts of  Sanskrit morphology.
But in addition to the purely linguistic aspect, we must reckon with the narrow  shared universe of discourse in the text. We have previously discussed the formu laic nature of R̥gvedic rhetoric. The shared deep-structure verbal formulae and the  shared knowledge of the nature of R̥gvedic gods, rituals, and religious principles  and beliefs allow the poets to refer to such knowledge with a kind of verbal short hand—truncated or twisted formulae, brief and recherché allusions, and so forth.  Deliberate ellipsis is an important stylistic feature of the text, with the audience  invited and expected to fill the ellipsis.
These issues present the translators with at least two problems (in addition to  figuring out what is actually going on). First, to try to reflect the density of the  text in a language that is not well adapted to this style—a balancing act through out the translation. Second, to determine when to supply material not found in the
80 The Rigveda
particular context, and what to supply. Although we began the translation with  the determination to supply nothing not found in the passage itself, this principle  came to seem not only unworkable but also contrary to the practice of the poets,  since they often rely on shared knowledge to allow their contemporary audience  to “fill in the blanks” of allusive expressions. But we have tried to avoid the regret
table tendency of some translators to supply material without any methodologi cal controls. Instead, supplied material in our translation is either generated from  material recoverable from the passage itself (e.g., verbs or nouns in the same or  adjacent verses) or from parallel phrases elsewhere in the text. Here the study of the  parallel passages adduced by Geldner in his notes has been absolutely crucial for  our interpretation, as well as other types of parallel phraseology, the discovery of  which has been much aided by Lubotsky’s R̥gvedic Word Concordance (1997). We  have thus attempted to allow the poets and the verbal connections they have forged  to determine what a passage needs for completion, rather than simply to follow our  own whims and a common-sense notion of what has been omitted, since “common  sense” is a culture-specific quality.
Most of the material we have supplied has been placed in parentheses, in order  to indicate that it is the result of our extrapolation and is not found explicitly in the  text itself. Although parenthetical additions can sometimes be distracting, the pos sibility of misleading readers about what is actually there and what is not, in a text  where almost nothing can be taken for granted, seemed to us a sufficient danger to  require major additions to be overtly signaled. However, some supplied material  has been silently slipped into the text proper, especially necessary English function  words that lack obligatory Sanskrit counterparts. For example, Sanskrit does not  obligatorily supply definite or indefinite articles (“the” vs. “a[n]”) and in fact does  not have either category as a separate grammatical marker. But English requires  them and we have supplied them; this often forces a choice on the translators as  to whether a noun is indefinite (“a horse”) or definite (“the horse”), but in most  such cases of ambiguity we have considered it a kindness to the reader not to indi
cate the uncertainty with parentheses. Likewise for possessive pronouns: Sanskrit  regularly does not overtly mark pronominal possession (“his horse”) where English  does, and in cases where the possessor seems fairly clear we have often supplied the  possessive without parenthetical marking. We also regularly supply pronouns for  repeated objects and the like, of the type “praise you and beseech you” rather than  “praise you and beseech (you),” unless the construction and meaning are unclear  or disputed. And, since Sanskrit does not have mandatory surface subjects because  the verb encodes the person and number of its subject, while English requires  subjects to be expressed, we have had to supply pronominal subjects, which has  required us on occasion to choose the gender of the subject (“he” vs. “she” vs. “it”).  Occasionally too, while the elliptical style of the R̥gveda might not repeat a verb or  other crucial word in proximate clauses, good English often must do so. In these  cases we have repeated the crucial word without indicating the absence of this rep etition in the Sanskrit text.
Introduction 81
A rarely used sign in our translations is the asterisk (*), which indicates that  the translation rests on an emendation. Since we seldom resort to emendation, the  asterisk will be encountered only occasionally.
B. Format of the Translations
Perhaps the most unusual feature of our translation is our decision to avoid the use  of footnotes entirely. We did not begin with that idea, but several considerations  led us to it. First, the notes in Geldner’s translation, especially the parallels he cites,  are full and informative, and interested readers should consult them: knowledge of  German is not required for tracking down the parallels. Further, this translation  will appear approximately coincident with the new Witzel-Gotō translation into  German, which contains annotations to verses that build on Geldner’s work. Yet  another set of similar annotations seemed to us unnecessary and redundant.
Second and more important, however, this decision reflects our view of the text.  One of the aims of this translation is to demonstrate that the hymns are unified,  structured compositions and not merely collections of single verses randomly col lected into hymns. Our emphasis on the integrity and structure of R̥gvedic hymns,  on the idea that the sūkta is the essential compositional unit, is to us the most per suasive reason to avoid footnotes, endnotes, or running commentary. If we were to  invite readers to turn away from the progress of the hymn toward notes of one kind  or another, we would risk causing them to lose precisely the thing we most want our  readers to have, the sense of the hymn as a compositional whole.
The starkness of our presentation is softened by several different strategies,  corresponding to different types of problems the text presents. First and most  important, we provide introductions to each hymn. These introductions treat the  overall structure of the hymn, its theme or themes, the development of the hymn,  and any special features it may have—special features being defined as whatever  strikes the translators as particularly noteworthy. These include intertextual con
nections with other R̥gvedic hymns, especially in the oeuvre of the same poet,  spectacular rhetorical flights or poetic devices, marked metrical features, out-of the-ordinary ritual procedures or models of rituals, little-known myths, interesting  twists on well-known myths, and so forth. We also discuss the conformity or non conformity of the hymn to the expected patterns of organization in the maṇḍala  or hymn collection when relevant—where verses or even whole hymns have been  added and hymns have been combined, divided, or relocated. Such changes reflect  the compositional history of the text and may be important for the interpretation  of the hymn.
On the other hand, the discussions in the introductions generally do not treat  technical linguistic details, except insofar as they impact the reader’s experience of  the hymn. However, we do not apologize for regularly mentioning grammatical fea tures of the hymn in such cases: the poets were, among other things, expert gram marians and often deployed particular linguistic forms to subtle semantic ends. To

remain in ignorance of this linguistic dimension of the hymns is to miss many of  their most striking effects.
In the introductions we usually do not engage with the considerable secondary  literature on the hymn or the variant interpretations of other translators and com mentators, including Sāyaṇa. Although study of this material has deeply affected  our reading of the text, a detailed discussion of how and why we differ from other  interpretations would swell our already long work to unmanageable proportions.
We know of no other R̥gveda translation that systematically provides such intro ductions for every hymn, rather than just for the famous or the famously diffi cult hymns. We hope that these introductions will give readers sufficient guidance  to proceed through the hymn without getting unduly mired in the difficult parts.  We also hope that the introductions will make clear how very different R̥gvedic  hymns are from one another, even when they are “about” the same subject, and will  counter the general assumption that the liturgical material in the R̥gveda, which of  course makes up the greater part of the text, is monotonously the same throughout.  Quite the contrary: the poets obviously sought novelty not only in individual details  of imagery and wording but also in their overall approach to well-worn topics,  and they thought out innovative ways to frame such topics. Even the sixty-seven  gāyatrī hymns to Soma Pavamāna that occupy the first half of the IXth Maṇḍala  and are extremely narrowly focused on a very few steps of ritual procedure manage  an astounding amount of variety within these metrical and topical limits. In fact,  they might serve as a textbook of how a R̥gvedic poet deploys his skills to produce  multiple, very different versions of a simple and single message.
A second type of aid we provide to readers relates to a major stumbling block  they will encounter in approaching the translation directly: while the original audi ence of the R̥gveda would have been able to identify the referent in a particular  verse on the basis of characteristic epithets, defining actions, or habitual associa tions, our readers will not have the cultural knowledge that the poet and his audi ence shared. Therefore, in many cases in which such references may not be clear to  our readers, we have inserted brief bracketed identifications to situate the reader  with as little fuss as possible. We have kept such bracketed additions to a minimum,  since we assume that the general introduction will familiarize our readers with com mon epithets, characteristics, and tropes, and therefore identifications of the type  “Vr̥tra-smasher [=Indra]” will be unnecessary. These bracketed additions are to  be differentiated from material in parentheses, supplied from context and neces sary to complete the syntactic construction of the verse, as was discussed imme diately above. We should note that identifying every stray referent and decoding  every cryptic image, either in the introduction or the bracketed insertions, would  prove to be unduly distracting—not to mention sometimes impossible—and read ers are encouraged to let the momentum of the poetry carry them across these little  perplexities. Some bracketed additions signal possible double meanings (puns or  double references) of single words, expressions, or constructions in the text; the  alternatives will be separated by a slash.
Introduction 83
Occasionally, for hymns in which density of reference or deliberate obscurity  makes each verse a challenge to decode and appreciation of the hymn as a whole  depends on following the unfolding of its cryptic train of thought, we will provide  a verse-by-verse exegesis in the introduction to the hymn. Again, we have kept such  discursive treatment to a minimum—not only for considerations of space, but also  on principled grounds: the R̥gveda is, first and foremost, poetry, and detailed para
phrase is a terrible crime to commit against poetry. It is especially a crime against  this poetry, where verbal execution, rhetorical ingenuity, and deliberate complexity  are central to its poetic style.
The heading of each hymn will provide the maṇḍala and hymn number, fol lowed, in parentheses, by its “Grassmann number.” Grassmann’s R̥gvedic lexi con did not make use of the usual numbering system of maṇḍala plus hymn, but  through-numbered the entire text without regard to maṇḍala (or aṣṭaka) divisions.  Although this number will be irrelevant for most readers of the translation, for  those who use the translation in conjunction with the Sanskrit text and the various  relevant reference works, including Grassmann’s lexicon, the Grassmann number  will facilitate cross-reference. (The Grassmann numbers for the first maṇḍala are  not supplied, as they are identical with the hymn number in that maṇḍala.) The  deity (or other element) who is the dedicand of the hymn follows the Grassmann  number in the first line, almost always according to the Anukramaṇī, except when  the Anukramaṇī’s identification is plainly fanciful or wrong. On the next line is the  poet, again as given by the Anukramaṇī; the third line gives the number of verses in  the hymn, the meter(s), and strophic arrangement, if there is one.
C. Hymn Distribution by Translator
At the beginning of this project, we two translators each took primary responsibil ity for approximately half the hymns of the R̥gveda and produced first and usually  second drafts of them. As the project continued, we consulted with each other at  every turn, passed hymns back and forth, and read each other’s translations criti cally. In the end, however, the final version of each hymn became the responsibility  of a single translator. The division of those final versions is as follows:
Maṇḍala I
JPB: 1, 24–25, 32, 46–47, 116–120, 157–158, 161, 164–165, 170–171 SWJ:  2–23, 26–31, 33–45, 48–115, 121–156, 159–160, 162–163, 166–169,  172–191
Maṇḍala II
JPB: 11–24, 27–28, 39
SWJ: 1–10, 25–26, 29–38, 40–43
Maṇḍala III
JPB: 1–7, 9–29, 58–60
SWJ: 8, 30–57, 61–6284 The Rigveda
Maṇḍala IV
JPB: 33–37, 42
SWJ: 1–32, 38–41, 43–58
Maṇḍala V
JPB: 1–28, 62–78, 85
SWJ: 29–61, 79–84, 86–87
Maṇḍala VI: SWJ
Maṇḍala VII
JPB: 1–17, 48, 50–52, 60–74, 82–89
SWJ: 18–47, 49, 53–59, 75–81, 90–104
Maṇḍala VIII: SWJ
Maṇḍala IX: SWJ
Maṇḍala X
JPB: 71–72, 81–82, 90, 108, 121, 129–130
SWJ: 1–70, 73–80, 83–89, 91–107, 109–120, 122–128, 131–191</p>
