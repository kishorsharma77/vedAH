2nd pl. vaḥ is one of those vague oblique references to the ritual personnel, here something like “on your own behalf.” Because such a throw-away Sanskrit word requires such a heavy English tr., I omitted it in the publ. tr.

pā́ntam here belongs to the nominal stem pā́nta- ‘drink’; see comm. ad I.122.1.

As Ge points out, loc. sā́nuni and instr. árvatā show case disharmony between frame and simile, in this case presumably because instr. árvatā is idiomatic. This is one of the few instances in the RV referring to horseback riding.
