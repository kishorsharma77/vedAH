For abc as a “repair” of pāsi in 5fg, see disc. there.

Most supply barhis as the obj. of the perf. part. vavarjúṣīṇām, and this is quite possibly correct. By contrast I take it in the metaphorical sense “twist s.o. towards oneself,” that is, attract to the sacrifice -- though we might prefer a medial form in that sense. And the mention of barhis at the beginning of the next hymn (I.135.1a) may support that standard view. As Kü points out (461 and n. 873), there’s no obvious explanation for the full-grade stem (expect *vavṛjúṣ-).
