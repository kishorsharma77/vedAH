The apparent loc. védī (so Pp.) should probably be read védi for metrical reasons (see Old: “nur angeblich Pragṛhya” [Noten]; Proleg. 456). AiG III.154-55 is skeptical about a loc. -ī to -i-stems and suggests that this, the clearest example, is actually to be explained by haplology from *védy[ām] asyā́m, which seems highly unlikely, esp. since it would make the cadence metrically irreparable. I think we have to take this form as given and as a locative (not instr.), with a metrically short final vowel, which may result from shortening in hiatus. For a similar ex. see bhū́mī (/ -i) in IX.61.10 and comm. thereon.

The last pāda contains a mixture of voc. (devā ādityāḥ) and nom. (yajñíyāsaḥ), with pāda-initial víśve ambiguous, since the accent may derive from its position. The tr. does not reflect this case mixture, since a meticulous separation would be fussy and serve no purpose.
