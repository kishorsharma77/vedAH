The two nominatives vṛ́ṣā ‘bull’ and ráthaḥ ‘chariot’ are juxtaposed, each qualifying Soma. I consider them separate characterizations, with Soma as both bull and chariot; so also Oberlies (RelRV II.71, 229). Ge takes vṛṣā́as modifying ráthaḥ (“Dieser bullenhafte Wagen”), while Re sneaks in a parenthesis to avoid identifying Soma with a chariot: “le-célèbre (soma), taureau, (cheval attelé au) char.” If taking them as independent seems too radical, Ge’s solution takes fewer liberties with the text than Re’s.
