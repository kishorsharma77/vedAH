The publ. tr. follows the usual configuration of equational nominal sentences, with the subject in 2nd position, the predicate nominal 1st . This interpr. is supported by the fact that the verb achān is singular, agreeing with bhágaḥ and índraḥ, not with pl. gā́vaḥ ‘cows’. However, the standard tr. (Ge, Wh) follow the opposite order, e.g., Ge “Diese Kühe sind mir wie Bhaga …” In which case, we would have to assume that achān simply agrees with the nearer referent, even though it is the predicate.

In c the phrase sá janāsa índraḥ must be a deliberate echo of the famous refrain of II.12. It also demonstrates the standard Vedic prose syntactic rule that in an expression of the type “what is X, that is Y,” the demonstrative in the 2nd cl. will agree with Y, not X, in number and gender, even though its real referent is X, or in this case cows.
