title = "10"

The simile in cd is unclear; its purport depends on what meaning is assigned to multivalent vibhú-, whose senses include ‘conspicuous’, ‘distinguished’, and ‘wide-ranging’, to which Ge adds ‘sich mehrend’, Re ‘abondant’, and WG ‘kräftig’.

In Ge’s and Re’s readings, the point of the simile would be the size of the herd and its growth through the birth of its young. This is certainly possible, and the point of contact with Agni would be the growth, that is, the blazing up, of the fire after its kindling. However, I do not see ‘increase’ as one of the core meanings of ví √bhū and prefer ‘wide-ranging’ here, with the simile expressing the grazing behavior of herds and the frame the fire’s tendency to spread. See 8b vánā vy ásthāt “he has spread out through the wood.” The final word of 10, dūrébhāḥ ‘far-radiant’, may support this interpretation. I do admit, however, that śíśvā ‘with their young’ makes less sense than in the Ge/Re interpretation.

Note that the opening of the last hemistich of the hymn, paśúr ná śī́śvā, “unpacks” the hymn’s first word paśvā́in a type of ring comp., and that this phrase was in a sense anticipated by 4b panvā́súśiśvim.
