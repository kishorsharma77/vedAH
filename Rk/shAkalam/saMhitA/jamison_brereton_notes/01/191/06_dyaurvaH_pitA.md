It is unclear to me why the bugs are being credited with such a grand pedigree. Perhaps to indicate that they are ubiquitous in the space between earth and heaven? Sāy. suggests this vs. and the next are addressed to snakes, but there seems no reason why adṛ́ṣta- would change its referent. As I noted in the publ. intro., the impulse to demand that a troublesome unswattable bug settle down long enough to be squashed is likely to be universal.
