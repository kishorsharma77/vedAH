Soma Pavamāna  
Nr̥medha  Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
Though attributed to a different poet and a different poetic lineage, this hymn,  like the last one (IX.26), is unified by a repeated initial pronoun in every verse, in  this case “this one, he” (eṣá) referring to Soma. Again, the content is conventional,  though there is emphasis on Soma’s victories and acquisitions (vss. 1, 2, 3, 4) and  his successful competition with the sun (vss. 2, 5). The cosmic aspect of Soma is  thus raised but not insisted upon.
