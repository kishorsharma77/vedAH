The abl. (or, in principle, gen.) riṣáḥ is a bit hard to construe. Whenever this form occurs elsewhere (and it’s not rare), it is with a form of either √pā or √rakṣ: “protect from harm.” Ge supplies ‘protect’ here as well: “(zum Schutz) gegen Schaden.” However, in the absence of a lexical ‘protect’ and in the presence of a verb of motion (yāthaḥ), I take it as an ablative of place from which.
