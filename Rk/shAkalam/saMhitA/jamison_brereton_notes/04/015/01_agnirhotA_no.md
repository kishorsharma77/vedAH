The usual concessive force of the nom. of the pres. part. to √as ‘be’ is absent here, as far as I can see. Ge suggests that it is marking the phrase as a simile (Re’s tr. suggests that he agrees). Since the vs. seems to concern the paryagnikaraṇa, the leading of the sacrificial animal around the fire, the sán may signal that Agni is acting in the guise of a horse, “being a horse.”
