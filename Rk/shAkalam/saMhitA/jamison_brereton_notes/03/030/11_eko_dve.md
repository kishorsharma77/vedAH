Pāda a begins with an elementary numerical figure: éko dvé “the one the two,” subject and object of ā́paprau respectively, both of which are identified in the 2nd pāda. The juxtaposition of the two numbers is responsible for my tr. éka- as ‘the one’, rather than ‘alone’ as elsewhere in the hymn (vss. 4, 5).

Because of the voc. śūra, at least pāda d (and probably also c) shows a switch to 2nd ps. from the 3rd ps. of ab. Since there are no verbs in cd, at least one needs to be supplied. Most tr. (Ge [/WG], Klein [DGRV I.442], Scar [431]) take c and d as separate clauses, supplying impvs. “come” and “bring” respectively. This is possible, but I follow Re in taking cd as a single clause -- though do not follow his interpr. of iṣáḥ as a verb (‘envoie’, presumably to √iṣ ‘send’).

All tr., incl. Re, take samīké as “in battle” (or, closer to the root sense in my opinion, Scar “Treffen”). Although this noun generally has the meaning ‘encounter’, it is a straightforward derivative of samyác- ‘united, conjoined’, and here I take it to refer to the “join” of Heaven and Earth, which would define the midspace. Note that pāda-final samīké matches pāda-final du. samīcī́in a, referring to Heaven and Earth.

I supply ‘bring’ as the verb of cd, with sayújaḥ … vā́jān as obj. There are several possible interpr of iṣáḥ. As just noted, Re takes it as a verb. Assuming (with everyone else) that it belongs to the root noun íṣ-, there are two possible analyses, as gen. (/abl.) sg. or nom./acc. pl., although in the latter case we would prefer it to be accented íṣaḥ (cf. the acc. pl. íṣaḥ in 18b). Both Klein and Scar take it as acc. pl.; I agree with Ge (/WG) in construing it as gen. sg. with rathī́ḥ.
