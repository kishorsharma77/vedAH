For detailed disc. of this verse, see my 1981 article, “A Vedic sexual pun: ástobhayat, anubhartrī, and RV I.88.6,” Acta Orientalia 42 (1981[82]) 55-63. The gist of the article is the interpretation of anubhartrī́, a feminine agent noun built to ánu √bhṛ, a euphemistic idiom that refers to sexual penetration -- e.g., in the cosmic incest myth (X.61.5). The paradox of creating a feminine agent noun from this idiom is the trick of the verse and echoes the use of vārkāryā́- in vs. 4 -- both, in my view, referring to the vīṇā, a feminine noun but a musical instrument with a characteristically phallic shape. The hapax causative ástobhayat ‘cause to sound’ (beside the simplex stobhati in b) has as its implicit subject the (male) player of the instrument and taps into the (probably universal) notion of a man playing a woman like an instrument in sexual encounters, with the added fun of the gender reversal in anubhartrī́. The instrument both sounds (práti ṣṭobhati, b) and is caused to sound (ástobhayat, c), a reasonable dual view of what a musical instrument does. I take vṛ́thā āsām, with its unidentified fem. gen. pl., as referring to all women, who, in male fantasy anyway, all “want it” -- conveyed by my somewhat loose tr. “the way women like it.” Other tr. supply ‘songs’ or ‘chants’ with āsām, for which there is no particular support.
