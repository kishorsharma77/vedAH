Agni
Vāmadeva Gautama
11 verses: jagatī 1, anuṣṭubh 2–6, triṣṭubh 7–11
Although this hymn consists of verses in three different meters, it was clearly con ceived as a unity, as was already seen by Oldenberg (1888: 153). The hymn begins,  as often, with the ritual installation of the current sacrificial fire, which is set against  the backdrop of the primal installation of Agni, treated in verses 1–5, in a non insistent ring structure. Verses 6 and 7, though in different meters, express the cen tral mysteries of Agni and therefore define a sort of omphalos. Verse 6 is structured  as a series of paradoxes concerning the nature of fire. Verse 7, quite reminiscent of  the omphalos verse IV.5.7, refers to the elements of the sacrifice in riddling fashion.  The hymn then turns to Agni’s role as messenger between Earth and Heaven (vss.  8–9, 11, first mentioned in vs. 3), with some vivid metaphorical description of fire’s  appearance and its consuming of flammable “food” (vss. 9–11).
