As noted in the publ. intro., the hapax ánapta- is difficult. Insofar as there is a standard view, it is taken as ‘unwatered, undiluted’ (Gr ‘nicht wässerig’, Ge ‘nicht verwässert’; EWA s.v. with lit.), while Re prefers ‘inaccessible’. Although the connection with ‘water’ makes the most superficial sense, esp. given its juxtaposition with immediately following apsú ‘in the waters’, it doesn’t make ritual sense, in that the soma is watered during these steps in the sacrifice, and in this very pāda the soma is depicted as being “in the waters.” My own desperate suggestion is not appreciably better, that it is formed to naptī́- ‘granddaughter, niece’, used of the fingers that prepare the soma. Two of the six forms of this word are found in hymns by just this poet (Asita Kāśyapa or Devala Kāśyapa), IX.9.1, 14.5). The word would mean ‘without the granddaughters’ (for the accent, cf. words like áprajā- ‘without offspring’ and AiG II.1.239-40), that is, without their ritual ministrations.

The point would be (if there is a point) that the soma speeds through the waters and would do so, even if it had not received these ministrations. I do not, however, set much stock in this suggestion, esp. since the morphology is dicey to say the least.

The phrase apsú duṣṭára- is found also in nearby IX.20.6, so this must be the constituency here -- and apsú is not to be construed with ánaptam. As Re points out, Soma is several time called ap-túr- ‘crossing the waters’ (e.g., IX.63.5, 21), and the expression here redistributes the elements.
