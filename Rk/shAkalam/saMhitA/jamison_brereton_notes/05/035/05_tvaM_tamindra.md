Ge takes adrivaḥ as ‘du Herr des Presssteins’, but in context a stone as weapon seems more likely (so WG ‘du mit den Schleudersteinen’, flg. Gr).

I interpr. sarvarathā́as an adverbial accompaniment to the victim whom Indra runs over: “(him), chariot and all.” It is not clear from Ge’s “mit ganz Wagenzug” whose chariot he thinks it is, but WG take it to be Indra’s chariot, interpr. sarva- in its stronger lexical sense ‘hale, healthy’: “… so, dass dein Wagen heil bleibt.” This purpose-clause reading attributes more, and more unambiguous, structure to this single word than I think it can properly bear, and I also don’t understand the intended sense: should Indra endeavor to keep the victim’s blood from splashing his wheels or his body from making dents?
