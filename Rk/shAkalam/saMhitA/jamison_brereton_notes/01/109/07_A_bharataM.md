I do not entirely understand the purport of the second half-verse. Ge compares VII.76.4, which shows some similarities and which refers to the forefathers finding the light of the dawn cows in the Vala cave. Much closer by is vs. 12 of the last hymn (I.108), in which Indra and Agni are urged to become exhilarated at sun rise in the middle of heaven. One way or another this must be a reference to the dawn sacrifice.
