I don’t know what íd contributes in b, beyond inducing accent on the verb tárati.

The standard tr. (Ge, Re, Ober [I.232]) take “(the milk) of Aditi” as the frame, with the simile limited to páyo ná dugdhám, e.g., “Tel le lait trait, (le lait) d’Aditi est fort.” I find this puzzling because Aditi has little to do with soma and has no reason to figure here. (On the phrase “in the lap of Aditi” in IX, see comm. ad IX.89.1.) Instead I think that it is soma that is being compared to the milk milked from Aditi; in other words, Aditi belongs to the simile. Since she is the archetype of motherhood, the milk of Aditi would be esp. rich and nurturing - “mother’s milk”; indeed this might be a reference to the beestings or “first milk” (pīyū́ṣa-), with which soma is often compared (see comm. ad IX.85.9).

Old, Ge, and Re all make more of the gender mismatch in the simile urv ìva gātúḥ than I think is justified. Since the target of the simile is milk (páyaḥ), and milk is neuter, I see no problem with attributing the neut. urú to its “attraction” to the neut.

páyaḥ, even though, given the position of ná, the simile should rightly be “like a broad way” rather than “broad like a way.” The masc. suyámaḥ in the next simile may result from the more animate quality of the content of the simile itself, the draught-horse.
