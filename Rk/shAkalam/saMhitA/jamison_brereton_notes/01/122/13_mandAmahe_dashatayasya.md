On the phrasal repair of 12b dáśatayasya by dáśastayasya dhāséḥ see comm. vss. 3, 5, and 12.

The “twice five” in pāda b may be the fingers, as I suggest (almost the default identification in a RVic ritual context), or the number of priests, indirectly conveyed by the tenfold soma of 12b and 13a. Ge (/WG) takes the “twice five” as directly characterizing ánnā: the twice five foods.

Ge (/WG) and Re take iṣṭā́śvaḥ and iṣṭáraśmiḥ as PNs of patrons. (Actually Re omits the first, presumably inadvertently.) I also take them as referring to patrons but with full lexical value: the one who has “desirable horses” and “desirable reins” [latter probably a stand-in for “chariots”] to offer. That “those showing mastery” (īśānā́saḥ) are patrons is strongly suggested by I.141.3, where that participle modifies sūráyaḥ ‘patrons’. The Saṃhitā text táruṣa is analyzed by the Pp. as táruṣaḥ, which could be a gen. with īśānā́saḥ (so Gr, Re, WG) or nom. pl. (so Ge). Old suggests that it could also be read as dat. táruṣe, against the Pp., which is how I take it. I then interpr. nṝ́n as referring not to the singers (so Ge et al.) but to still other patrons with whom they are competing to provide the best recompense to the singers.
