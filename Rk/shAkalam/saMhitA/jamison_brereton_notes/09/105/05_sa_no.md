The first pāda in each begins sá no, followed by a GEN.PL. + pate voc. expression, with deaccented gen. pl. The second pāda begins with voc. indo, followed by the cmpd. devá-psaras-, in the splv. in 105, but the simple nom. sg. in 104. See disc. ad 104.4 for the parenthetical nature of 104.4b. The structure of c in both is sákheva sákhye … bhava. In 104.5c in between we get a splv., perhaps a delayed match to the splv. in 105.5b. The filler in 105c is different.
