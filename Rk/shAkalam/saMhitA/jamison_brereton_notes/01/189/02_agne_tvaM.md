Pāda c provides a fine parallel to “A mighty fortress is our god.” The word order is somewhat unusual, in that we might expect naḥ to take Wackernagel’s position in the pāda as a whole; instead it seems to have taken up a version of that position in the post-caesura phrase bahulā́na urvī́, which simply modifies the nom. sg. pū́ḥ that begins the pāda. There might be several reasons for this. For one thing ca occupies that position, but this is not a particularly compelling suggestion because the function and positioning of that ca are somewhat puzzling. Klein (DGRV I.220 n.

81) suggests that it connects pū́ḥ … bhávā with the clause earlier in the vs. whose verb is pārayā. I would suggest rather that it is an inverse ca conjoining the two predicate nominatives construed with bhávā, i.e., pū́ḥ and śáṃ yóḥ. (This would, among other things, eliminate another ex. of supposed sentential or clausal ca, ascribing to it its more usual role as conjoiner of nominals.) It may also be that the alliteration in the phrase pū́ḥ … pṛthvī́would stand out more starkly without naḥ in between, but that should apply to ca as well.
