The expression dákṣam pṛñcántam is somewhat peculiar, and Ge takes the two words as separate qualifiers of Indra: “dem Verständigen, Spendenden.” However, I.141.1 bhágaṃ dákṣaṃ ná papr̥cāsi suggests that dákṣam should be the object of the pres. participle. By the tr. “engorging skill” I mean that Indra fills his latent quality (skill) with energy (perhaps derived from soma and praise) and makes it available to use.

Acdg. to the Anukramaṇī, our poet Viśvamanas has the patronymic Vaiyaśva (vs. 23), that is, son of Vyaśva (‘without horses’), and the poet mentions his family in vss. 22, 28-29 with the distracted stem vi yaśva-. But in this verse he refers to himself instead as aśvi yá-, also distracted, which, on the one hand, is simply an anagram of the family name with the first two syllables reversed, but, on the other, credits him with possession of (or at least relationship to) horses, whereas the unmetathesized version announces him as horse-less.
