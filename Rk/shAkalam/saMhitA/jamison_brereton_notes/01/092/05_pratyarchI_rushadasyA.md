As noted before, vs. 5 seems to match vs. 1 and begin a new hymn parallel to vss. 1-4, but adapted for a single dawn, not the multiples in vs. 1. The return of the words bhānú- ‘beam’ and √añj ‘anoint’ (1b) is particularly salient, as also √śri (2d), √arc (3a), and péśas- (4a).

The poet produces yet another complication of simile structure in cd. The Daughter of Heaven in d is clearly the subject of the clause, but the simile occupying c has a participle in the masc. nom. sg., añján, which cannot modify the grammatical subject. We must here supply a masculine ritual officiant, who is propping up and anointing the sacrificial post, as Dawn props up and anoints her beam. (Note that bhānúm served as object of both verbs in the earlier parts of the hymn: 1b bhānúm añjate, 2d bhānúm … aśiśrayuḥ.) The two distinct objects in simile and frame are mediated by the word péśas-, which is appropriate to both. Dawn has just donned her own péśāṃsi in 4a, but péśas- can also be used of ritual paraphernalia -- e.g., the pressing stones, which are called adhvarásya péśaḥ at VII.42.1.
