Gr takes sahásrabāhve (with distraction, -bāhuve) as belonging to a ustem and as a poetic synonym for ‘battle’. I find this suggestion quite attractive, though this type of kenning is somewhat unusual for the RV. Ge and Old (see also EWA s.v. bāhú-; Mayrhofer PN) take it as a thematized -bāhva- in the locative as a PN (Ge: “bei Sahasrabāhva”). Though Gr’s interpretation gives the richer semantics, the problem is of course that the dative sg. should be -bāhave, not -bāh u ve. AiG III.139 also identifies it as a thematic locative, but allows a lexical meaning “in der tausendarmigen Schlacht,” flg. Sommer). I still think it may be a dative, with the alternative -ve ending (e.g., páśve beside paśáve), but a locative with lexical value is also possible.
