“Three times a day” (tríḥ … adyá) opens the hymn, announcing the hymn’s “three” theme and also linking it to the three pressings of (some Ṛgvedic versions of) the Soma Sacrifice.

Predicative voc. navedasā here rendered as part of a phrasal verb, with impv.

bhavatam.

The second hemistich is built on an etymological relationship between the instrument noun yantrá- (c) and the gerundive abhyāyaṃsénya- (d), both built to the root √yam ‘hold’ (the second form presumably to the s-aor. of that root; so AiG II.2.503, though the reason for using this base isn’t clear). This word play is lost in Ge’s (/WG’s) tr., but I have aimed to keep it, unfortunately producing some awkwardness in the English.
