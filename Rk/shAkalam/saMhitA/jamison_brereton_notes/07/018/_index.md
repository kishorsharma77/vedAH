Indra (Battle of the Ten Kings) I have little or nothing to contribute to the interpr. of this famous hymn, esp.

of its historical or quasi-historical aspects. The hymn has been extensively treated by a number of scholars both fairly recently, esp. H.-P. Schmidt (Indica 17 [1980], 41- 47) and M. Witzel (in The Indo-Aryans in Ancient South Asia [1995], esp. 333-37), and in the past, and I will therefore limit my comments. See the publ. intro. for structural and contextual disc. I am certain that many puns, wordplays, and snide asides are completely unrecoverable today and respectfully suggest that we put our energies into interpreting parts of the RV where we have a chance of success.
