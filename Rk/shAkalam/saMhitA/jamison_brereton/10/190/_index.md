Bhāvavr̥ttam (“Cosmogonic”)
Aghamarṣaṇa Mādhuchandasa
3 verses: anuṣṭubh
This hymn presents a cosmogony with tápas “ascetic heat, fervor” as the ultimate  origin of everything. The entities created and the order and source of their cre ation are curious and thought-provoking, but unlike the famous cosmogonic hymn  X.129, there are no puzzles to decode.
