[I.165 Indra and Maruts (misc. comments by SJ to JPB tr.) This hymn is full of somewhat “off” forms, some of them unique to the hymn

-- yujmahe (5c), ūgrá- (6c, 10c), cyavam (10d) -- a few confined to this hymn and
one or a few other passages -- vadhīm (8a), kariṣyā́(9d). It is not clear to me whether these are the result of faulty transmission or of the poet’s manipulation of form, though I incline towards the latter explanation, given Agastya’s characteristic selfconscious artfulness. In either case the clustering of these anomalies in a single hymn makes it unlikely in each individual case that they belong to the systematic grammar of Vedic or reflect deep archaisms or old sound changes, as has been suggested for several of them. For further remarks see the individual discussions below.

The trajectory of the hymn might be seen as the battle of the lexicon: words pass back and forth between the two speaking parties, with twists in their usage and with terms that seem to belong to one of the parties appropriated by, or devalued by, the other. Among the most important words are éka- ‘alone, only’ and the multiple forms of √kṛ ‘do’. Note esp. the extraordinary concentration of √kṛ in the middle of the hymn: 7a cakartha, 7c kṛṇávāmā, 8d cakara, 9c kariṣyā́kṛṇuhí, 10b kṛṇávai, 11b cakrá, including two of the rarest pf. forms, 1st sg. cakara and 2nd pl. cakrá.
