The vs. contains three “intensive” participles: kárikrataḥ, mármṛśat, and nā́nadat. All three, in my opinion, express repetitive or repeated action. In particular kárikrataḥ, in my tr. ‘making and remaking’, nicely reflects the constantly changing shape of the smoke rising from the raging flames.

I take mahī́m ‘great’ (fem.) separately from avánim and referring to the earth; by this interpr. the whole earth serves as Agni’s course (‘stream bed’).
