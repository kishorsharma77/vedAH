On bhuríj- see comm. ad IX.26.4.

Though chariot-making is a common trope and regular comparandum in the RV, it is not usual (at least as far as I can recall) to compare the preparation of soma with the assembling of a chariot. It may appear here because the thus-prepared Soma is about to follow the track of the cow, at least in my interpr.

The grammatical identity of jígāt in c is disputed. It appears to be, and is usually taken as, an injunc. to the redupl. pres. jígāti (Gr, Macd [VGr, p. 342], Lub, Hoff. [Inj. 271 n. 12, but hesitantly]; by implication Ge and Re), but Old (and by implication Lü 252) suggests that it’s a nom. sg. pres. part. and, on the grounds of pā́nt- and yā́nt-, sees no difficulty with this analysis. But, of course, for a redupl.

pres. the weak form of the participial suffix is expected even in “strong” forms, and is in fact found in participles to other redupl. pres. to roots in -ā, √dā and √dhā, with well-attested nom. sg. m. dádat-, dádhat-. Though I accepted Old’s word (as I so often do) in the publ. tr., I now think jígāt is better taken as an injunc., though this need not change the actual tr.: “As he goes, he extends …,” with implicitly subordinated 1st verb in a two-verb sequence. “He goes, he extends …” is of course also possible.

The interpr. of the rest of the hemistich is uncertain, due to differing opinions about the sense and syntactic position of padám. With regard to its sense, padá- is of course multivalent: ‘footprint, track, place’and ultimately ‘word’. As for its syntax, does it belong in the main clause beginning in c, modified by apīcyàm, with yád in d beginning a new cl., or does it belong to the yád cl. of d? Ge follows the latter tack, with two NPs, góḥ apīcyàm and padám, in two separate clauses: “er stürtz sich auf das Geheimnis der Kuh, wenn die Andächtigen(?) seine Stätte bereitet haben,” with padá- = ‘place’. The Geheimnis der Kuh is the milk (n. 5c). There is nothing impossible here, but the adj. apīcyà- ‘secret’ invites association with padá-, on the basis of the semantics of the formulaic phrase “hidden track,” which is found in IX in
