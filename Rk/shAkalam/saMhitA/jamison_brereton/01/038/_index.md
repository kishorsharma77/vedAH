Maruts  
Kaṇva Ghaura  
15 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in tr̥cas  
The conversational tone that was occasionally discernible in the previous hymn  (I.37) is fully in evidence here, especially in the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3), in which the  poet peppers the Maruts with castigating questions about their whereabouts: the  gods are clearly absent from his sacrifice and presumed to be enjoying the sacrificial  offerings of rivals. The poet continues in this intimate tone in the next tr̥ca—first  (vs. 4) slyly suggesting that if their positions were reversed, the Maruts, as poets,  would praise him, the current poet, like a god, and then begging them to keep him  safe (vss. 5–6) and to end the current dry spell (vs. 6c). The compressed and abrupt  quality of gāyatrī meter is ideally suited for this conversational style.  
The next six verses (7–12) present a more conventional description of the Maruts  as the thunderstorm, with familiar images. In the last three verses (13–15), the poet  exhorts himself to sing not only to the Maruts but like the Maruts, especially in  verse 14. The first verse of this tr̥ca (13) introduces two other divinities, the Lord  of the Sacred Formulation (to whom the same poet will dedicate nearby I.40) and  Agni; it is not clear why they share this last tr̥ca with the Maruts.
