Agni
Aruṇa Vaitahavya
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 15
This hymn is reminiscent of X.89 in style: a well-crafted, self-consciously rhetorical  praise of the god utilizing standard tropes and traditional images. The poet of this  hymn is especially fond of etymological figures (especially in the first few verses)  and chaining between verses (note, e.g., vss. 8d/9a, 10/11).
The hymn covers many familiar themes, contrasting the physical fire (e.g., vss.  5–7) with the deified fire and his ritual roles, but it is the latter aspect of Agni that  is dominant.
