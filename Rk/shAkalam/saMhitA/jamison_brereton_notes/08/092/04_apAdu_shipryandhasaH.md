The first pāda of this new tṛca matches that of the first tṛca (1a): √pā (pā́ntam (1a) / ápāt (4a) … ándhasaḥ#.

índor índro is an example of the word play, much beloved in IX, between índu- ‘drop’ and índra-, but this case is particularly nice because sandhi allows the two words to be identical, save for the reversal of the final two sounds (or ∼ ro).
