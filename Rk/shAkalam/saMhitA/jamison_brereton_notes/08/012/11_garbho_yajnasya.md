The subject of this verse is not made clear. Ge suggests either stóma- or dhītí-. The latter is more likely in my view, continued from vs. 10. There are no clashing non-feminines, since devayúḥ could serve either for masc. or fem., and in any case could be matching the gender of the gárbhaḥ. Another possibility is Agni, since he is regularly called an embryo in these circumstances, but the unity of the tṛca speaks against this. I would therefore change the “it”s in the publ. tr. (“its intention,” “it has grown,” “it is”) to feminine forms, to match vs. 10.

The VP krátum punīte of b is found in the next hymn, VIII.13.1b, where the subject is Indra, but that referent is not possible here.
