Bearing the pressed (soma) of the sacrificer, master of the settlements,  he [=poet] is the udder, the ladle of all visionary thoughts.  
He bears the (two) milk-cows [=Heaven and Earth, or Agni and Soma];  the milk, full of sap, has been brought to perfection. The one who  
recites following (his teacher), he learns, not the one who sleeps.
