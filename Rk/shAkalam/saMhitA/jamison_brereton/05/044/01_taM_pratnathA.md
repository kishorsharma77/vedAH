Him—in the primordial way, in the earlier way, in every way, in this way  here—(him who is) preeminence (itself), who sits on the ritual grass
and finds the sun,
him facing toward (our) community will you milk out with song, the swift  one conquering (the cows? the waters?), among whom you grow strong.
