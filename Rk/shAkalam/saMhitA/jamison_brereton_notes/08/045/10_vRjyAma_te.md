Ge takes b and c together as a single clause and has gómataḥ modify te (“zu deiner, des Kuhbesitzers, Schenkung”), but gómant- is not regularly used of gods (though it occasionally is) and is frequently found with vā́ja- ‘prize’, as in vs. 28 below. And áram is used elsewhere as predicate of a nominal clause.
