Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
One of the ten Āprī litanies found in the R̥gveda. This is one of the eleven-verse  versions, with Tanūnāpāt in position 2 and no Narāśaṃsa. It is a trickier Āprī hymn than most, in that not all the key words are overtly expressed but are implied by  derivationally related (vs. 1) or phonologically similar (vs. 3) words or are simply  gapped (vs. 5). For example, rather than the usual past participle samíddha “kin dled” in the first verse, this hymn has the āmreḍita nominal samít-samid “kindling  stick after kindling stick.” In verse 3 iḷáḥ “of the milk libation” substitutes for the  usual īḍitá “solemnly invoked,” with similar phonology though they are etymo logically and semantically unrelated. In verse 5 the expected Divine Doors do not  appear but can be supplied with the feminine adjective pūrvī́ḥ “many.” As usual,  the key words (or their substitutes) are italicized in this translation. The final four  verses are identical to VII.2.8–11.
