The 1st dual subjunctive (śáṃsāva) coupled with a sg. voc. (adhvaryo) is a rough and ready way to express a 1st ps. inclusive. This type of construction contrasts with the 1st ps. exclusive found in phrases like VII.88.3 ā́yád ruhā́va váruṇaś ca nā́vam “When we two, Varuṇa and I, mounted the boat …” with a nominative explicitly conjoined with ca to an implicit ahám.

The injunctive bhūt in d must also, like yakṣi in 2b, be modal/prospective or even imperatival, since the áthā ca indicates that it temporally and/or logically follows the impv. sīda in c.
