Though a number of interpreters (Gr, WG, Scar) take vacoyújā as an instr. sg.

and supply ráthena ‘chariot’, this form otherwise (4x) is only du. and modifies hárī ‘the two fallow bays’. Thus, it seems better to follow the Sāy/Ge/Re interpr. As Ge points out, the untethered ā́in b allows a form of √sthā to be supplied, in the idiom ā́ √sthā ‘mount’. The verse is then slightly unusual in referring to Indra’s twin horses in two grammatical cases in the same sentence (háryoḥ loc., [hárī] vacoyújā acc.).
