bhavítra- is found only here in the RV. My “(the means of) Creation” gives full functional value to the instrument suffix -tra-. Gr “die Welt,” Ge “Creatur (?),” Re “le séjour-des-existences”; see Re’s n. for further, though inconclusive, disc. The immed. preceding hymn contains janítra- (VII.34.2), which seems to mean something similar, insofar as it’s possible to tell.
