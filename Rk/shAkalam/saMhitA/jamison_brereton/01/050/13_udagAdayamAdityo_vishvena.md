Up has gone this Āditya here, along with all his strength,
making the hater subject to me. May I not become subject to the hater.
Here begins the second large division of Maṇḍala I (51–191).
The next seven hymns (I.51–57) are ascribed to Savya Āṅgirasa and consist only  of Indra hymns. For the most part the hymns are a glorification of Indra’s deeds— both the standard and well-known triumphs like the smashing of Vr̥tra (see esp.  I.52) and numerous lesser-known feats, which are presented in catalogue fashion  (see esp. I.51, 53). The style is often syntactically and rhetorically contorted, with  rare words and obscure expressions.
