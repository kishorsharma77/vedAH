túgvan- is a hapax. Ge and EWA (hesitatingly) take it as ‘ford’, following one suggestion of Gr’s; Old and Hoffmann (Injunk. 234-35) as ‘Stromschnelle,” following another. Of the two, ‘ford’ would make better sense in context: all this giving would be better at a place where the animals aren't likely to be swept away by a rapidly flowing river. On the other hand, the likely root etymon, √tuj ‘thrust’, is not really conducive to ‘ford’. Re’s ‘source’, which I follow, solves both problems: a river at its source is generally a fairly placid affair, and √tuj is used esp. of the thrusting forth of progeny, a situation to which the arising of a river could be assimilated.
