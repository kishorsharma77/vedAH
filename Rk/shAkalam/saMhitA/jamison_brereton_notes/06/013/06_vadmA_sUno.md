Both Ge and Re separate pādas a and b, and Ge’s tr. seems at least potentially to take the subj. of a, vadmā́, as non-coreferntial with Agni (“Ein Redner … (werde) uns ... zuteil”), but since vadmán- occurs only here and in nearby VI.4.4, where it definitely refers to Agni, I do not see the point.

A factor influencing the Ge/Re separation of the pādas may be the apparent presence of enclitic naḥ in both pādas: … no víhāyā(ḥ)# / … no dāḥ#. However, the second naḥ should almost certainly be read as the final syllable of the preceding vājí, thus *vājínaḥ, acc. pl. of vājín-, a possibility floated by Ge in n. 6b. Note only does this reading eliminate the pleonastic enclitic, but it also eliminates the only supposed neut. nom./acc. sg. to vājín-, which would be required to modify neut. tókam (e.g., Ge “siegestekrönten leiblichen Samen”). A change is only required in the Pp.; the Saṃhitā text is undisturbed. An asterisk should be inserted in the publ. tr. before “prize-winning.” The seemingly late position of naḥ in pāda a, before the final word víhāyāḥ, is actually not so late after all: it can count as (modified) Wackernagel’s position, after an accented initial word (vadmā́) followed by the phrasal vocative sūno sahasaḥ. ## 014 Agni
