The same double reading may apply to eṣi in pāda a, which has a goal (again in a simile), but also could be read with the part. apaghnán “he keeps smiting rivals.” śakunó ná pátvā “like a flying bird” seems closely modeled on 19a śakunó vibhṛ́tvā “a bird spreading (its wings). In itself the expression is a bit puzzling. If the bird is “flying” it should not already be “sitting” (sī́dan), and it seems unlikely that pátvan- is meant to distinguish it (as ‘flightful’) from a flightless bird like a dodo.
