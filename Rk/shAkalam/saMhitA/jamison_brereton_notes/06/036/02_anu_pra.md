Since verbal forms of √yaj are not otherwise found with ánu nor does the lexeme ánu-prá √yaj occur anywhere else, I take ánu prá yeje as a technical reference to the fore- and after-offerings (prayājá-, anuyājá-, already attested in late RV). The ánu may have been included because of the idiom ánu √dā ‘concede’ in the next pāda. On the weak pf. form yeje (versus īje) see comm. ad I.114.2 and Kü 391-92.

Contra Ge, Klein (DGRV I:224-25), and Scar (115-16), who take c with d, I construe b and c together, with the two datives vīryā̀ya (b) and syūmagṛ́bhe dúdhaye ’rvate (c) parallel to each other and serving as the indirect object to dadhire ánu ‘have conceded’ in b. This allows ca at the end of c to take its usual role conjoining NPs, rather than serving as a clausal conjunction (joining b and cd) as Klein is forced to take it. In either case the ca is unusually positioned, but as a clausal conjunction its position might be more jarring.

This interpr. also allows a better case frame in d: ápi √vṛj krátum + LOC is an idiom of subordination; cf. X.48.3 máyi devā́so ’vṛjann ápi krátum “To me have the gods bent their will” (sim. X.120.3). But for both Ge and Klein the dative of c must take the place of the usual loc.; e.g., Klein “And to (him), the bucking courser grabbing the reins, do they direct their determination in the battle against the obstacle.” In my interpr. I supply a loc. ‘to him’ in d, likely gapped because of the presence of the circumstantial loc. ‘at the smashing of Vṛtra/obstacles’ (vrtrahátye), with the dat. of c more naturally construed with the verb in b, ánu √dhā, which ordinarily takes a dative.

With Gr, Ge, and Klein, I take the root noun cmpd. syūma-gṛ́bh- in c as having the transitive value “pulling at [/grabbing] the reins,” expressing the impatience of the “headstrong charger” that is Indra. Curiously, Scar (115-16) gives it the passive sense “der … beim Zügel gepackt wird,” indicating that the same headstrong charger has to be reined in. Although this interpr. is in principle possible, in practice it seems unlikely that the poets would dare to consider (much less desire) curbing Indra’s impetuous rush.
