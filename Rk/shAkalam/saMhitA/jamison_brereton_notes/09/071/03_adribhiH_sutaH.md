This vs. is characterized by an accumulation of finite verbs, esp. in the 2nd hemistich, which contains five: … modate násate sā́dhate … nenikté … yájate.

The cloud in b can be read in two ways, ritually as the milk mixture (see nábhas páyaḥ in 1c; also nabhasmáyam in IX.69.5d, both as ‘underlayer’; also Ge’s n. 3b), but cosmically as a rain cloud. This latter sense connects nicely with the verb vṛṣāyáte: Soma, as often, is depicted as acting like a bull, but this verb can also be associated etymologically or folk-etymologically (on the likely etym. connection see EWA s.v. vṛ́ṣan-) with √vṛṣ ‘rain’ (see Re’s n.).

Pāda c is more intricately structured than at first appears. On the one hand all three verbs, modate násate sā́dhate, appear to be construed with the final instr. girā́; cf., e.g., Re’s “Il jubile, caresse, réussit grâce au chant,” as well as the publ. tr.

However, only the central verb násate is regularly construed with an instr.; modate is found once (X.30.5) with an instr., while the relatively rare medial sā́dhate ‘succeeds’ generally lacks complements. Moreover, when násate takes the instr., it appears with the preverb sám - as it does in fact in vs. 8: sám INSTR násate sám INSTR, with the sám insistently repeated. In our pāda I would suggest that there is a ghostly trace of this sám in the opening sequence sá modate, which could reflect an older or underlying *sám modate. Though this would have metrical consequences, they would be slight, since the quantity of pāda-initial syllables is always indifferent.

This posited *sám cannot be read with the immediately following verb modate, since √mud never appears with sám in the RV (although the rt noun cmpd svādú-sammud- [so accented] is found twice in AVŚ), but “skips” to the 2nd verb in the sequence.

The repeated sám in 8d can then be interpr. as a type of poetic repair.

The verb nenikté ‘washes’ is of course etym. related to nirṇíj-, the word for garment that figures so heavily in these hymns (incl. in the immed. preceding vs., 2d), but their developed meanings are too divergent to allow the connection to be represented in Engl.

párīman- is a hapax, but, as is generally agreed (see EWA s.v., Re’s n.), it most likely belongs to √pṝ̥‘fill’. It may have been formed on the model of better attested várīman- ‘broadness’, which ends the next vs. and occupies the same metrical slot. Both these words function in much the same way as tánā ‘in its full measure/extent’, which ends vs. 2.
