As he often does, Ge takes cid as a simile marker, but I do not think that is a possible function of cid, and certainly in this case there is no need to interpret ánniyate as a simile: Agni is regularly depicted as a greedy eater.

Contra Gr, all standard modern tr. and comm. take niśíṣat (so Pp.; niśíṣan is also phonologically possible, though morphologically unlikely) as belonging to √śā ‘sharpen’ (common with ní), not √śās ‘instruct’ (not found with ní). There are formulaic parallels with clear forms of ní √śā; see Ge’s n. 7b and esp. VII.3.5c. With Old it seems best to emend to *niśíśat. He takes it as a short-vowel subj. to the redupl.

pres. śíśāti. So also Hoffmann (Aufs. II, 445-46 n. 14). This is certainly possible, but it could also be a masc. nom. sg. act. part. to this same redupl. pres. Both a finite 3rd sg. in a rel. cl. and a part. would be accented on the stem (not the preverb) as here, and either form is contextually possible. It can simply belong3 to the string of subjunctives in this passage that express ritual service. But note pāda a of the previous vs. (6a), which has a subj. and a part. (jabhárat siṣvidānáḥ); one could argue that in this sequence of vss. there is no more than one finite verb per pāda, though that is not a particular telling argument.
