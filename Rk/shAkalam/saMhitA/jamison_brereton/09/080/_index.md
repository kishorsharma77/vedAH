Soma Pavamāna  
Vasu Bhāradvāja  
5 verses: jagatī  
On the one hand, this hymn is somewhat static, stuck at the same stage of soma’s  preparation, as the almost exact responsion of the last two verses (4–5) emphasizes.  On the other hand, Soma’s relationship with the gods, especially Indra, a relation ship that figures in every verse, enlarges the conceptual frame of the hymn and  keeps it from seeming airless.
