I take the two occurrences of īyate in b as passives to √yā ‘implore, beseech’ (with putative underlying accent īyáte)(so also WG), not to ī́yate ‘speeds’ as most do.

This echoes tám pṛchata “ask him!” that opens the verse and the two forms of √pṛch opening vs. 2.

As recognized by all, sā́nv … is difficult. Since a feminine subject is pretty much excluded, I interpr. sā́as sá ā́(already floated as a poss. by Old [Noten]). In this clause, repeating immediately preceding īyate, ā́and nú add locational and temporal specificity. (The publ. tr. might make this clearer with “he is here and now implored.”) Although I think the primary sense of iṣṭáyaḥ is ‘wishes’ (nicely contrasting with praśíṣaḥ ‘commands’), the secondary sense ‘offerings’ (to √yaj) can also be present. Although that sense is rare and usually associated with root-accented íṣṭi-, puns often ignore accent, and moreover, since root-accent is secondary in this class and spreading in Vedic (see Lundquist, -ti-stems), it is likely that there existed an old (*)iṣṭí- ‘offering’ that underwent accent retraction in the course of time.
