The nominal rel. cl. yó vídānaḥ, interrupting a string of accusatives, is syntactically curious. It seems to represent a sort of izafe, rather than a real embedded relative cl. I have tr. it as if acc. índram were the predicate of the participle (“who is known as “Indra”), despite the difference in cases. Ge, in contrast: “der bekannt ist.” My interpr. might be better represented as “I will praise him — Indra, as he is known — whose …” This interpr. fits well with the doubts expressed about Indra later in the hymn, esp. vs. 4. See also vídānaḥ in 12b.

The instr. gīrbhíḥ in b might be better construed with the verb stuṣe in a: “I will praise him with songs”; it has been displaced to the right to be nearer to gírvāhasam.

The second hemistich contains a strikingly mixed construction, with the usual matched pair heaven and earth in two different cases, acc. dívam, abl.-gen. pṛthivyā́ḥ, though construed with the same verb. The two different cases are controlled by two different PREVERB + √ric combinations, one overt, one implied. Overt is áti √ric ‘extend beyond, surpass’, which is rather rare but takes the acc., as in VIII.92.14, 22 ná tvā́m indrā́ti ricyate “nothing surpasses you, Indra” (cf. also X.90.5); hence our … dívam áti … riricé. The implied construction is the more common prá √ric ‘extend beyond’ which takes the abl., as in I.61.9 asyéd evá prá ririce mahitváṃ, divás pṛthivyā́ḥ pári antárikṣāt “his greatness projected beyond heaven and earth, beyond the midspace” (note clear abl. antárikṣāt) (cf. also I.59.5, 109.6, etc.), hence our … pṛthivyā́ḥ … ririce mahitvám. Examples of this latter constr. are found in this group of Indra hymns (VI.24.3, 30.1), and despite the absence of prá here it is not surprising that the abl. construction would creep in.
