The first hemistich is somewhat awk., with (by my interpr. and Ge’s) a genitive phrase uróḥ … rā́dhasaḥ “of your broad largess” dependent on an almost synonymous nom. phrase vibhvī́rātíḥ “extensive giving.” WG apparently take the first not as gen., but as abl., indicating the source of the giving: “Von deiner … weitreichenden Gunst aus entfaltet sich die Gabe.” This seems like a good idea and mitigates the awkwardness. I would then change the publ. tr. to “Your extensive giving (comes) from your broad generosity.”
