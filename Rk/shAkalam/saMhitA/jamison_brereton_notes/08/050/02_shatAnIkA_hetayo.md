The two versions of this verse deviate slightly more than those of vs. 1: identical and identically positioned: a: śatānīkā (though difference in number concealed by sandhi), a/c: asya; more or less identical, but with inflectional difference: c: giréḥ / girír, pinvire / pinvate; root connections: 49d -bhójasah / 50c bhujmā́. Otherwise the verses are distinct, but notice that 50a śatā́nīkā hetáyaḥ allows the noun with śatā́nīkā in 49a to be supplied.
