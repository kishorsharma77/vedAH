Agni and Parjanya seem an odd couple, and this dual dvandva is found only here. But recall that the two appear together earlier in the hymn, in vs. 6 (with Indra and Sarasvatī), and in fact Parjanya is oddly well represented in this set of All God hymns; cf. the dual dvandva parjányā-vā́tā in VI.49.6, 50.12. In our vs. the two are given a division of labor, conveyed by the “the one … the other” construction of c (íḷām anyó janáyad gárbham anyáḥ), but curiously which god is responsible for which begetting is unclear enough to have produced entirely opposite interpretations.

In his n. 16c Ge, who does not commit himself in his tr., cites Sāy. at length, who thinks that Parjanya produces the íḷā-, while Agni produces the gárbha-. Re the exact oppposite: “Que l’un [Agni] engendre l’oblation-liquide, l’autre [Parjanya] le germe.” Although I think Re is more likely correct, the analysis is by no means certain. Note, on the one hand, nearby VI.50.12 parjányā-vā́tā pipyatām íṣaṃ naḥ “Let Parjanya and Vāta swell refreshments for us,” which supports Sāy.’s interpr. On the other, Parjanya is more regularly associated with rétas- ‘semen’, and one passage in one of the three hymns dedicated to him, V.83.1, is esp. telling: réto dadhāti óṣadhīṣu gárbham “He deposits his semen as embryo in the plants,” with the gárbhafound here. The ambiguity is probably meant.

As Ge points out, the two products are reconciled in the last pāda, where both gods are urged jointly to give us “refreshments accompanied by offspring” (prajā́vatīr íṣaḥ), with prajā- standing in for gárbha- and íṣ- for íḷā- from pāda c.
