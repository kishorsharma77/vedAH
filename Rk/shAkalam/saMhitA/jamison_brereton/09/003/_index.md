Soma Pavamāna
Śunaḥśepa Ājiīgarti
10 verses: gāyatrī
Following the pattern set by IX.1–2, the Anukramaṇī gives as the poet of  this hymn the author of the third collection of hymns in Maṇḍala I  (24–30),  Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti, also the protagonist of the famous Aitareya Brāhmaṇa story  of father/son sacrifice (AiB VII.13–18), related during the Rājasūya, the Royal  Consecration.
The hymn is verbally unified by the “this (one)” (eṣá), which begins every verse.  It is thematically unified by its focus on only one step of the preparation, the filter ing through sheep’s wool that is the self-purification proper. A form of the verb  “purify oneself” appears in seven of the ten verses (and “filter” derived from the  same root in an eighth; only vss. 1 and 6 lack such a form). The poet provides vari ety with a range of images, from the bird of verse 1 to the chariot rider in verse 5,  and as is common he conflates, and equates, the ritual and cosmic spheres. So, for  example, the filter across which the soma moves is both a tangle of wool (vs. 2) and  the vast spaces of heaven and the atmosphere (vs. 7).
