I consider the genitives in pāda b, turásya … vidhatáḥ to modify Indra, whereas Ge takes them with the ‘resolve’ (krátvaḥ), which he considers to be the soma, of pāda a. The problem, in his view, is that vidhánt- doesn’t easily qualify Indra (turá- regularly does), but since the root √vidh ‘honor’ is an old derivative of ví √dhā ‘apportion’, taking it in its etymological sense allows it to modify the god.
