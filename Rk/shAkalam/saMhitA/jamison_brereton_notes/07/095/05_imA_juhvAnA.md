My interpr. of the syntax and the reference in this vs. differs considerably from the standard. Most (Ge, Re; see also Old) take b as parenthetic, with pāda a parallel to c, both containing nom. pl. m. med. participles with 1st ps. subjects, júhvānā(ḥ) and dádhānā(ḥ) respectively. The first part. is transitive with imā́as object. Hence, “Offering these (oblations, vel. sim.) … , setting ourselves in your shelter, we …” Under this interpr. according to Re, the yuṣmát in pāda a refers to the patrons, already found in vs. 3 -- rather loosely construed (“de votre part”). Ge fails to identify the 2nd pl. referent, while Old considers both the patrons and the rivers possible and makes no decision.

Although the Ge/Re(/Old) interpr. is certainly possible -- and has the parallelism of the two participles in its favor -- I am reluctant to bring in patrons, who figured only in the Sarasvant vs. 3, and I also prefer to avoid parenthetical clauses if at all possible. I therefore go against the Pp. in taking the first participle as júhvānā and neut. pl., rather than júhvānāḥ and masc. pl. As a nom. pl. neut., the part.

is passive and forms a nominal clause with imā́, with the participle predicated (as is not rare). The part. stem júhvāna- is found with both transitive and passive interpr.

(Note that Gr takes this form as passive, but as a nom. pl. fem. in -āḥ modifying his supplied gíraḥ ‘hymns’, represented by imā́ḥ [requiring him to go against the Pp reading imā́].) 121 By my interpr. of pāda a, the 2nd pl. refers to the (other) rivers just featured in 4d, and in the expression yuṣmád ā́, ā́means ‘all the way to’, though it must be admitted that ā́in that usage usually precedes (see Gr col. 169). Old himself suggests as one of his possibilities “bis zu euch hin” of the rivers or waters. The ambiguous position of ā́in the expression in 2b giríbhya ā́samudrā́t “from the mountains all the way to the sea” also has ā́directly before an abl. expressing goal.
