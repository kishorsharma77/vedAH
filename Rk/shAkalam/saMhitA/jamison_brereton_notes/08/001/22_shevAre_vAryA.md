śévāra- ‘treasury’ is a hapax, derived from haplologized *śéva-vāra- ‘having dear valuables’, a derivation found already in Gr (though with vara- as suggested 2nd member; for reff. see KEWA s.v. śévaḥ). Note its juxtaposition with vā́ryā ‘desirable things’ here.

I take pāda a as a nominal sentence, and supply rāsate ‘will grant’ in b, from c, given their parallel datives. Ge takes ab as a single sentence and supplies “verwahrt” (keeps), again possible but not generated from context.
