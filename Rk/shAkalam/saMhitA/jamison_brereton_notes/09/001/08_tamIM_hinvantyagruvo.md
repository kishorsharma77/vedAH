The ‘unwed girls’ are also the fingers alluded to in the preceding vs.: the pl. agrúvaḥ is always so used.

In b they are clearly blowing into a musical instrument: bākurá- is a hapax, a vṛddhi deriv. of bákura- also a hapax (I.117.21), used of a musical instrument one blows (√dham), as here. Both show non-Indo-Aryan phonology. But what does this have to do with soma preparation? and how can fingers “blow” into a pipe? Ge, ad I.117.21, suggests that the skin pipe is the “bildlicher Ausdruck für die Somapflanze”; perhaps the reference is to the stalk, and perhaps the fingers pressing on the stalk produce a noise similar to a pipe. Or -- perhaps the poet has simply gotten carried away by a picture of festivity, with unmarried girls celebrating at a gathering.

The next question is what to do with the acc. phrase in c. I find it unlikely that the “wild honey” is in apposition to the bag-pipe of b, though Ge seems to take it that way. Re supplies another verb “(elles traient),” whereas I take it as a return to the object of hinvanti in pāda a, with b loosely parenthetical. It is “threefold” (tridhā́tu) perhaps in reference to the three soma pressings, or to some other ritual triplet (see Ge’s suggestions n. 8c). For further discussion of tridhā́tu … mádhu see comm. ad IX.70.8.
