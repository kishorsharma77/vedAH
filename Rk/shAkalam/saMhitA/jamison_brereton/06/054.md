Pūsaṇ
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
10 verses: gāyatrī
Pūṣan is here in his role as protector of livestock and finder of lost things,  especially cows.
## 1
Pūṣan, lead (us) together with one who knows, who will direct (us)  aright,
who will say “just here it is.”
## 2
Might we come together with Pūṣan, who will direct (us) to the houses, and who will say “just here they are.”
## 3
Pūṣan’s wheel does not suffer harm, nor does his (wagon’s) cask
fall down,
nor his wheel-rim waver.
## 4
Whoever has done honor to him with an oblation, him Pūṣan does not  neglect.
He is the first to acquire goods.
## 5
Let Pūṣan follow after the cows for us; let Pūṣan protect the steeds; let Pūṣan win the prize for us. 6. Pūṣan, go forth after the cows of him who sacrifices and presses (soma), and of us who praise (you).
## 7
Let none disappear; let none be harmed, let none get fractured in a hole. But with unharmed (cows) come here.
## 8
Pūṣan who listens, the take-charge one whose possessions never get lost, him holding sway over wealth do we beseech for wealth.
## 9
Pūṣan, under your commandment might we never suffer harm.
We here are your praisers.
## 10
(Even) from a distance let Pūṣan place his right hand around (us); let him drive our lost (livestock) back to us again.
