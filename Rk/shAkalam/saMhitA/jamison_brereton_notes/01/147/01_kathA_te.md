All other tr. take dadāsúḥ as preterital (e.g., Ge “... haben … aufgewartet”), but Kü (243) interprets this pf. stem as having presential meaning with an implication of past action (“präsentische Bedeutung mit Implikation einer vergangen Handlung”), and I take both this verb and injunc. raṇáyanta in d as presential, establishing the ritual situation as so often in Dīrghatamas’s hymns. The present moment continues in vs. 2.
