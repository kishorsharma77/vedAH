dādhā́ra here is the only intransitive form of this perfect; see Re’s n. and Kü (261).

The last word of the hymn, prabhū́vasoḥ (“of the one who brings outstanding gifts”) is the gen. of the name of the supposed poet of this hymn, Prabhūvasu Āṅgirasa, who is also assigned the next hymn, IX.36. Of course the name in the Anukramaṇī could well have been generated from the final word of this hymn.
