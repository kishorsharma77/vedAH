The multiple possible meanings of the root(s) √cit and the unclear morphological identity of (prá) cikitaḥ make the interpretation of the first pāda somewhat difficult. I follow Thieme’s solution (Plusq.), adopted also by Kü (176-77), that it is underlyingly a medial injunctive to the perfect stem (that is, an unaugmented pluperfect), patterning with pf. cikité, etc. But the underspecification of this posited

*cikita caused it to be re-marked with an active ending (like root presents of the type
aduha-t). It should not be a subjunctive, despite its thematic appearance, because of the zero-grade root syllable, and, pace WG, it should not be a trans./caus.

reduplicated aorist because of the light reduplicating syllable (expect *cīkitas) -- although I do have to admit that acikitat in VII.80.2 does seem to function like a redupl. aorist. WG supply panthā́m, from b, as object in a, but this seems unnecessary. On a potential ring made by prá cikitaḥ here and prá cikitsā in the last pāda of the hymn (23d), see publ. intro. The other question in pāda a is whose inspired thought is at issue. I assume that it is ours (that is, the poets’), in that the priests and poets create the ritual that makes soma manifest.
