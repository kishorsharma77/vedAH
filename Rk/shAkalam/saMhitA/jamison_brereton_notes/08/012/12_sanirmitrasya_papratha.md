Since sáni- is only a nom. actionis, not an agent, it must mean ‘winnings, gain’. What it must mean here is that Indra is what we win if we keep our part of the sacrificial bargain (mitrá-).

The subject of c must again be the dhītí-. So also Ge. But the point of the simile “like an axe” (vā́śīva) is somewhat unclear, though Ge’s explanation seems reasonable: just as the thought is measured out metrically (mímīta íd), so is an axe wielded in a regular rhythm (he compares VIII.19.23).
