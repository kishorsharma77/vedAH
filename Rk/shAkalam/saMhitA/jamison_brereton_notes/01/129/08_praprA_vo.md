With the repeated prá-pra I supply a form of the copula for the idiom prá √as ‘be preeminent’.

Note the common use of instr. pl. adj. (here sváyaśobhiḥ) with (apparent) sg.

pāda-final ūtī́. This interpr. seems preferable to WG, who supply “gods” with the pl.

adj. and take ūtī́separately.

As in 4a this clause contains both a full 1st pl. pronoun (asmé) and the enclitic 2nd pl. vaḥ. As there, I think the 2nd ps. referent is the patrons, in addition to the 1st ps.

ritual officiants, but, once again, a tr. “be preeminent among us for you” seems clumsy, and I did not render the vaḥ in the publ. tr.

I take the fem. subject of d-g to be personified durmatí-, with Ge. Others, going back to Sāy, take it to be the jūrṇí- of g (see Ge n. 8d), but I think that belongs to a simile.

The opening of d, svayáṃ sā́echoes that of 6d svayáṃ só.

Ge refuses to tr. vakṣati and feels that it cannot belong either to √vah or to √vakṣ. I take it with √vakṣ / ukṣ ‘grow’, as a malformed nonce subjunctive to úkṣa- / ukṣá- (or preferably a derivationally prior, unattested root formation).

In g I take ná as both the simile marker and the negative. (This is rather like the haplology of *ná no I posited for 5g.) “Like a firebrand … she will not …” If I am correct this is yet another example of the ná simile marker displaced to the right.
