Unfortunately this last verse of the tṛca does not seem to have any connection with the foregoing Indra-Marut dialogue. The "I" is presumably not a Marut, but the poet or other ritual officiant, and it’s difficult to know how his holding on to the horses will bring about Indra’s gifts. Is he holding them hostage, as it were, not allowing them to leave the ritual ground and return to heaven (recall the “Fallowbay-yoking libation” that ends I.61-63 and sends Indra and his horses back home at the end of the sacrifice) until Indra distributes the goods? Or is he helpfully holding them to leave Indra’s hands free? Given the aggressive tone of the previous two verses, I favor the former idea.
