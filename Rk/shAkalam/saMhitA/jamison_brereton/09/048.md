Soma Pavamāna
Kavi Bhārgava
5 verses: gāyatrī
The poet begins his hymn with a request for benefit, though a rather generic one (vs.  1). The militant theme of the previous hymn is visible in verse 2, while the story of  the falcon’s theft of Soma from heaven, a myth not prominent elsewhere in Maṇḍala  IX, is the subject of verses 3–4. Unlike most of the gāyatrī soma hymns, this one  contains no explicit reference to the preparation of the soma, with only a glancing  mention of the “impelling” of soma in the final verse (5), a term generally used in IX  of the push that starts the soma on its purificatory journey through the filter.
## 1
You who bear your manly powers among the seats of great heaven we implore for something dear through this good ritual performance— 2. You who have encoiled the bold and are worthy of hymns, having very  great commandments, exhilarating,
eager to break a hundred strongholds.
## 3
From there, from heaven, the unfaltering falcon brought
you, the king, to wealth, o strong-willed one.
## 4
It was for everyone to see the sun that the bird brought you as one (to be)  held in common,
the herdsman of truth, crossing through the airy realm.
## 5
And now, being impelled, he has acquired more eminent greatness,  appropriate to Indra,
as the limitless creator of superiority.
