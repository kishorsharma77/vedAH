I take the final juṣéta hí of pāda a as a parenthetical remark, contrary to the standard tr. The rest of the verse (as well as the preceding verse) addresses Indra in the 2nd ps.; moreover, the position of hí is most easily explained if juṣéta opens the clause, and a gen. complement with √juṣ, as suggested by Gr, would be (almost?) unprecedented. The standard tr. (Ge, Re, WG) take asyā́uṣásaḥ as a temporal expression “on/during this dawn here,” but supposed exx. of this usage elsewhere are not convincing. The collocation in fg … asyá vedhásaḥ … śrudhi … is structurally identical to asyā́uṣásaḥ … bodhi, a parallelism that supports my interpr.

If, as I believe, asyā́uṣásaḥ is to be construed with bodhi in b, the first term in b, arkásya, can serve as transition, since this word means both ‘chant’ and ‘ray’; as ‘ray’ it would group with uṣásaḥ, as ‘chant’ with havíṣaḥ ‘oblation’, linking the coming of dawn with the dawn sacrifice.
