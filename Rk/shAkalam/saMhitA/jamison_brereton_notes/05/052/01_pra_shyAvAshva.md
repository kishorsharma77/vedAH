On the somewhat anomalous expression in the first hemistich, see reff. given just above.

The 2nd hemistich is also syntactically somewhat compromised. Forms of uncompounded √mad that mean ‘take pleasure in / enjoy’ seldom if ever (possibly VII.49.4) take the acc. (as also noted by Re), in preference to instr., gen., or loc.; yet mádanti here seems to take acc. śrávaḥ as obj. It might be possible to extract ánu from the cmpd anuṣvadhám ‘according to their own nature’ and construe it with mádanti, since ánu √mad ‘cheer on’ does take an acc. -- but a personal acc., not the neut. inanimate ‘fame’ that it would govern here. So an unresolvable syntactic tension has been set up. I think the tension reflects the double role of the Maruts already encountered in pāda b. As recipients of Śyāvāśva’s praise chant, they would “take pleasure in their fame,” but as participants in the chanting they would “cheer on” the fame of other(s).

Ge and Re seem to take adroghám as an adv., a possibility also mentioned by WG. However, the other apparent adv. form has initial accent (ádrogham VIII.60.4), and furthermore the existence of a bahuvrīhi ádrogha-vāc- (2x) and the syntagm adroghá- vácas- (III.14.6) support a collocation with semantically similar śrávas-.
