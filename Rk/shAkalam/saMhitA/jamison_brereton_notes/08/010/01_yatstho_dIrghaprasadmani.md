Ge and Re take dīrgháprasadman- as a PN, but I follow Gr and Old in taking it as a fully lexical bahuvrīhi, ‘providing a long seat’. Both of the latter consider the word an epithet of the earth, and the parallel cited by both, V.87.7 dīrghám pṛthú paprathe sádma pā́rthivam, is quite suggestive. However, the other occurrence of this form in VIII.25.20 seems to narrow its application to the ritual ground, rather than the earth in general.

I do not know quite what an ā́kṛta- house is, and the past participle kṛtá- is not otherwise found with ā́. The publ. tr. ‘prepared, made ready’ follows Ge/Re.

However, since the lexeme ā́√kṛ generally means something like ‘bring here’, and since there is no second vā in pāda c, I am tempted to tr. “on the sea in a house directed here’, namely a boat, though this may be too whimsical.
