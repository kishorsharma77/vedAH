Lord of the Dwelling Place (Vāstospati) (1), Sleep ̣ Incantations (2–8)  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
8 verses: gāyatrī 1, upariṣṭādbr̥hatī 2–4, anuṣṭubh 5–8  
As was noted in the introduction to VII.54, the first verse of this hymn, dedicated  to the Lord of the Dwelling Place, really belongs with the previous hymn—though  it was not simply wrongly divided from that hymn: it is in a different meter, and the  final verse of VII.54 ends with the Vasiṣṭha clan refrain, which is always the final  pāda of the hymns in which it is found.  
What follows this first verse is one of the most beloved and most delightful of  R̥gvedic hymns, a sleep charm, a species of lullaby. It is divided into two parts by  the meter (vss. 2–4, 5–8), but forms a conceptual unity. Verses 2–4 are addressed to  a dog, presumably a watchdog barking in the night, who is urged to go to sleep. The  dog is given a grand metronymic, “son of Saramā,” the legendary bitch of Indra,  who on Indra’s behalf tracked down the cows stolen by the Paṇis and retrieved  them, in the memorable dialogue hymn X.108.  
The next two verses (5–6) are an incantatory listing of each member of the house hold, sending them all to sleep one by one (reminiscent of the modern American  children’s book Goodnight Moon). The next verse (7) puts them all to sleep with the  moonrise, with the final verse devoted to an intriguing set of unidentified women  falling asleep wherever they happen to be. This fleeting picture of somnolent ladies  reminds us of several similar famous scenes in much later Indian literature, such as  the sleeping rākṣasīs in Rāvaṇa’s household in Laṅka in the Rāmāyaṇa (V.7.30–62,  8.30–46) and the sleeping women whose fleshy sensuality disgusts Siddhārtha, the  future Buddha, in Aśvaghoṣa’s Buddhacarita (V.47–67).  
A number of fanciful scenarios have been devised, both ancient and modern,  Indian and Western, as the backstory of this hymn, but this creative plotting seems  unnecessary: the hymn can be simply enjoyed for itself.
