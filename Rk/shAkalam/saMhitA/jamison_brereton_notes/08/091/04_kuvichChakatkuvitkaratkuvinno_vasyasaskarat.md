The compound patidvíṣ- is usually tr. with passive sense (Ge: ‘vom Gatten gehasst’), but this has more to do with the scenario for the hymn constructed by the tr.

and comm. than with the structure of the compound. Grammatically speaking we would expect an active sense: passive value is fairly rare in root noun compounds, and, as Scar points out (249), though he does not abandon a possible passive value, the other -dviṣ- compounds are all active in sense. An interpretation guided by the compound structure would give ‘hating husbands’, a perhaps not unlikely sentiment in a pre-adolescent girl about to be married off in ancient India. The verse expresses the anxious excitement of a girl on the cusp of marriagability and adulthood (Jamison 1991: 170-71).
