The Cows and Indra  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
8 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 2–4, anuṣṭubh 8  
Although this hymn is found right in the middle of the Indra cycle, the Anukramaṇī assigns most of the verses in this hymn to the cows (1, 3–8c), with a few (2, 8d) to  the cows or Indra. The hymn was later used as a blessing for cows as they return  home, but it may originally have been intended to bless the cows given as a dakṣiṇā (priestly gift) as they enter the home of their new owner. According to the Vaitāna  Śrauta Sūtra 21.24, the sacrificer awaited the cows intended for the dakṣiṇā with the  hymn Atharvaveda IV.21 (=R̥V VI.28.1–7). It is worth noting that almost the last  word of the preceding hymn (VI.27.8d) is dákṣiṇā, and this may have invited the  placement of this hymn here.  
The safety of the cows of the pious man as they graze is the subject of much of the  hymn, and the various dangers that could befall them are detailed: being stolen by a  thief or in a cattle raid, getting lost, going to the slaughterhouse. They are also given  rather grandiose identifications in verse 5, including with Indra: 5c is a clear echo,  almost to parody, of the famous hymn II.12 with its refrain: “he, o peoples, is Indra.”  
The final verse is in a different meter, and as it is not part of the Atharvaveda  version of this hymn, it was probably originally separate. In form it is a magical  exhortation and makes use of the only slightly euphemistic verb upa-√pr̥c “mix  sexually.” The verse obviously expresses the wish that the cows become impreg  
nated, and thus picks up the adjective “bearing offspring” in verses 2 and 7. The  use of the near deictic “right here” modifying “the inseminator” suggests that the  performance of the spell has a physical component in addition to the verbal, as is  regularly found in the Atharvaveda.
