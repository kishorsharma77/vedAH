The incest myth treated in vs. 5 returns here with no more clarity. The various alternative treatments are too numerous to discuss here, so I will present only my own version, some of whose details I have adopted from others. The first hemistich describes again Agni as the avenger, loosing his weapon at Heaven in the midst of the latter’s sexual encounter with his daughter. In pāda a the téjaḥ, the sharp point of the arrow, reaches the lord of men (=Agni, in my view), so that he can shoot it. I do not understand why his preparation for shooting should be described thus, and in a phrase ā́naṭ + ACC we might expect the acc. to express the target of the arrow.

Nonetheless, Heaven is not otherwise called nṛpáti-, and it would be odd to give him this positive epithet in this situation. For Agni as an archer whose arrow has a téjassee VI.3.5 sá íd ásteva práti dhād asiṣyáñ, chíśīta téjò 'yasā ná dhā́rām “He, just like an archer, has aimed (his arrow), about to shoot. He has whetted its point like a blade of copper.” I take iṣé in this pāda as an infinitive to √iṣ ‘impel, send’ (others interpret it as ‘to enjoy’); I then supply a form of this same verb in the next pāda, which otherwise lacks one.

Note that the product of this incest, the young troop (śárdham … yúvānam), is characterized as both ‘faultless’ (anavadyám) and ‘well-intentioned’ (svādhyàm), asserting their goodness despite the circumstances of their birth.
