Since they are grooming (√mṛj) him, the ‘unwed ones’ (agrúvaḥ) are probably here the fingers, continuing the fem. pl. agent but modulating from streams to fingers (whose number is not specified here).

In b the phrase ádhi ṣváṇi is problematic. It is generally taken as a root noun loc. to √svan ‘sound’: Gr, apparently Ge (see his n. 9b and his locatival tr. “unter Gebrause”), apparently Re (but see his hesitations in his n.), Schindler (Rt. Noun p. 51, but see below), Ober (II.73)—though Lub lists it under a stem sváni-, so presumably interpr. it as a nom./acc. sg. neut. Schindler’s disc. suggests a slight variation on the root noun interpr., with the possibility that it is used here as an adj. ‘rauschend’ modifying jīráu, as Gr takes it.

In that case the independent sván- was extracted from the compd tuvi-ṣváṇ- ‘powerfully sounding’, an interpr. that seems over-elaborate.

Whether as root noun or an -i-stem, our form is equated with sváni in the similar pāda-final phrase ánu ṣváṇi in VI.46.14. However, I have demonstrated that sváni in that phrase must be a verb form, a 3rd sg. passive aor., as Old suggests. See comm. ad loc. Scar, in a detailed disc. of the two sváni forms (676-77), suggests that our phrase, too, might contain a verb form. By his analysis pāda b is an (unsignalled) dependent cl., parallel to the yád clause of c, and so the accent on 3rd sg. sváni would be correct for a finite verb. He tr.

“es putzen dich …, während es über der Wollseihe, unter dem fliessenden Wasser raschelt [und] während du … gesalbt wirst.” This is clever, but I am disturbed by marking only one

- and only the second - subordinate clause overtly. Moreover, this interpr. also must assume
that there is a gapped subject to sváni or that it is used impersonally (both possibilities floated by Scar). None of this is impossible, but the required assumptions and syntactic twists pile up.

I am drawn rather to an old suggestion of Aufrecht’s, endorsed by Old (but rejected explicitly by Schindler and Scar) that ádhi ṣváṇi rests on ádhi *ṣṇávi “on (the sheep’s) back.” Because of the morphological difficulties (the nonexistence of a loc. *snávi to begin with), I would not posit Aufrecht’s intermediate form, but simply assume a reduction and metathetic scrambling of sā́navi, which occurs several times in the pāda-final phrase ádhi sā́navi (VI.48.5, IX.31.5, 37.4, 63.27); ádhi is the standard post- (/pre-)position in this expression; cf. also ádhi sā́no avyáye IX.86.3, 91.1, 96.13, 97.40 and numerous variants.

The presence of ávye at the beg. of the pāda would set the audience’s expectation for “on the back of the sheep.” The presence of the “noise” root √svar in the preceding vs. (8a asvaran) may have facilitated the metathesis, to produce a form appearing to belong to the phonologically and semantically similar root √svan, reinforced by rebhá- in the flg. pāda.

In c I take rebháḥ … ajyáse as a pun, dependent on the literal sense of √ribh, which, rather than being ‘sing’ as it generally is glossed, is really ‘creak, rasp’. See comm. ad VI.3.6. Here Soma is as usual ‘anointed’ (ajyase) with milk, and in that regard he is identified as a rebhá-, a ritual officiant with a particular voice quality. But as disc. ad VI.3.6, in a TS passage √ribh is used for a squeaky wheel, and of course the way to fix such a wheel is to “grease” it (√añj). So the unmarked comparison here is “(as) a squeaky (wheel) is greased.”
