Maṇḍala VII is unusual because in this, the longest of the Family Books, almost all  the hymns are attributed to just one poet, Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi, Vasiṣṭha the son  of Mitra and Varuṇa. According to the Anukramaṇī two hymns were composed  either by Vasiṣṭha or by Kumāra Āgneya (101, 102), and two hymns were joint com
positions of Vasiṣṭha and his sons (32, 33). In 32, however, it assigns one pāda, or  at most one and a half verses, to Śakti Vāsiṣṭha, and the rest of the hymn is by his  father. The Anukramaṇī unequivocally attributes all the other one hundred hymns  of the maṇḍala to Vasiṣṭha alone.
This attribution of all these hymns to a single poet is historically unlikely. Perhaps  many of the poems were composed by Vasiṣṭha, but unlike the other family poets,  the Vasiṣṭha poets apparently developed a tradition of crediting their work to their  illustrious ancestor. Because of this focus on him, Vasiṣṭha emerges as a distinct  literary figure in the maṇḍala. He is mentioned—or mentions himself—twenty-four  times in VII, and he appears as a model ritualist also in hymns from later maṇḍalas,  for example, X.150.5, X.181.1, both attributed to his descendants, and X.65.15.  Not only is he a distinct figure in the R̥gveda, he also has a distinct literary person ality. For the construction of a poetic persona, see Jamison (2007: esp. chap. 1, and  the following chapters) for a discussion of Vasiṣṭha.
Maṇḍala VII also has a distinctive distribution of hymns. It includes nine  hymns dedicated, either wholly or in part, to the Ādityas or to Mitra and  Varuṇa, four hymns to Indra and Varuṇa, and four hymns to Varuṇa alone. The  significant role that the Ādityas and particularly Varuṇa play in VII perhaps  reflects a family connection to these gods, which also figures in the tradition  that Vasiṣṭha was the son of Mitra and Varuṇa. The personality of Vasiṣṭha is  defined most strongly in the four hymns to Varuṇa (VII.86–89). They describe  an intimate relationship between the poet and the god, in which the poet fears  the god’s displeasure but hopes for his mercy and his guidance, while recalling  their previous friendship.
The maṇḍala also contains the R̥gveda’s longest continuous series of hymns to  the Aśvins (67–74) and to Dawn (75–81), although the hymns of neither collec tion show the originality of the Varuṇa hymns. There are a number of noteworthy  individual hymns. Among the most significant is VII.18, depicting the so-called
880 VII.1
Battle of the Ten Kings, which may reflect actual events, although with what accu racy it is hard to say. In distinctly triumphalist language, it tells how King Sudās  and the Bharatas were victorious over an alliance of ten kings ranged against him.  This battle may have been historically important if it marked the dominance of  the Bharatas over other Vedic tribes and significant movement toward a political  consolidation of the Vedic peoples. Closely connected with VII.18 is VII.33, attrib uted partly to Vasiṣṭha himself and partly to his sons. The hymn affirms the role of  Vasiṣṭha in securing Indra’s critical help in Sudās’s victory over the ten kings and  concludes with his sons’ story of the birth of Vasiṣṭha. Another quite remarkable  hymn, although in a very different vein, is VII.103, the Frog Hymn, in which the  poet compares the action and croaking of frogs to the ritual acts and recitations  of priests. The hymn was likely composed for the beginning of the rainy season  and with the purpose of spurring the fertility appropriate to the season. Equally  unusual and delightful is the sleep charm (VII.55).
The Vasiṣṭha clan refrain, “Do you protect us always with your blessings,” occu pies the final pāda of most of the triṣṭubh hymns in this maṇḍala.
## 1 
1 (517) Agni
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
25 verses: virāj 1–18, triṣṭubh 19–25
This hymn contains a double ending. The first is at verse 20, which concludes with  the signature pāda of the Vasiṣṭhas in 20d and which is marked by a shift to triṣṭubh  meter in verses 19–20. The hymn continues in triṣṭubh to verse 25, which repeats  verse 20. Oldenberg suggests that there is a deliberate attempt to make this hymn  parallel to VII.34, the first of the hymns to All Gods, which also has twenty-five  verses. The two parts of the hymn, verses 1–20 and 21–25, are thematically similar  since both are concerned with the life and lineage of the householder, although the  second part places particular emphasis on Agni as the sacrificial fire and the bless ings that he can bring.
The hymn describes the kindling of Agni in the house so that the household  fire will guard its prosperity and help it flourish. Agni will be the leader of the  household (vs. 3) and the fire of the sacrifice (vs. 16). In particular, the householder  desires sons and other males in his extended family, who will bring prosperity to  the home and guarantee the householder’s continued lineage. These are the vīrā́ḥ
“men, heroes” (vss. 5, 11, 15, 19, 24), an abundance of whom the poet desires and the  lack of whom he fears (19). The poet also mentions the náraḥ “men” or “fine men”  (vss. 1, 4, 9, 10, 11), who in the first three of these verses are described as ritually  serving Agni. That function is typical of náraḥ, who elsewhere in the R̥gveda are often  priests. Here the vīrā́ḥ and náraḥ do not appear to be different people, however,  since they are described in similar terms. So the náraḥ in 4c and the vīrā́ḥ in 15c are both “well born,” and the poet asks that the householder never suffer from the lack  of either (11a and 19a).
The poet repeats the word nítya in reference to Agni as “our own” or “their own”  (vss. 2, 12) and to “his own” offerings (vs. 17) and “our own” lineage (vs. 21). He  also repeats svá, which has a similar sense, with reference to “our own” devotion (vs.  6) and the householder’s “own” kin (vs. 12). Through their repetition and meaning,  the two words form a nexus between Agni and the householder, which connects  the kindling and tending of the fire to the longevity of the householder’s family.  Likewise in verse 17, as Geldner notes, the circumambulation of the Hotar with  the fire around the fire-place is described as the procession of a bride and groom  around the fire at a wedding. The imagery of the wedding affirms that Agni is now  a member of the family of the householder.
More generally, the poet creates a close connection between Agni and  humans by allowing either one to be the subject of verse 23cd and either one  to be the object. That is, either the god Agni allows the priest to obtain goods  from the gods and the patronage of a sacrificer, or the priest makes it possible  for Agni to obtain goods for mortals and to become accessible to the patrons  of the sacrifice.
### 1
Our men gave birth to Agni in the two fire-churning sticks, by their  insights and the motion of their hands—to him who is proclaimed,
to the flaming houselord, visible far away.
### 2
To give help anywhere, the good (gods) installed in the home Agni,  beautiful to look upon,
the one to be skillfully tended, who was in the house as their own.
### 3
When you are kindled forth, Agni, shine in front for us with your  inexhaustible shaft of light, o youngest one.
Prizes of victory ever go toward you.
### 4
Your brilliant fires blaze forth, abounding in good men, better than  (others’) fires,
here where our well-born men sit together.
### 5
Through insight, Agni, give us wealth abounding in good men and, o  capable one, a good lineage that is proclaimed
and that the invading sorcerer does not overcome.
### 6
The very skillful one toward whom the young, oblation-bearing girl [=the  ladle], filled with ghee, goes in the evening and at dawn,
toward him (goes) our own devotion, seeking goods.
### 7
Agni, burn away all hostile powers with the heat by which you burned  Jarūtha.
Make sickness disappear without a sound.
### 8
O best Agni—flaming, shining, pure—he who will kindle your face  here—
also because of these praise songs (of his) you should be here for us.
882 VII.1
### 9
Our ancestral, mortal men, who shared among themselves your face  many times, o Agni—
also because of these you should be favorable here to us.
### 10
Let these men, champions at the smashing of obstacles, prevail over all  ungodly wiles—
they who marvel at my insight that is proclaimed.
### 11
Agni, let us not sit in the absence of men, nor (let us sit) around you  without posterity because of a lack of heroes [=sons]
amid (other) houses filled with offspring, o you belonging to
the house—
### 12
(Let Agni approach) our dwelling, which the horseman [=Agni]  approaches as his own to sacrifice, (a dwelling) filled with offspring  and endowed with a good lineage,
having increased by our own kin’s posterity.
### 13
Protect us, Agni, from the detestable demon. Protect us from the  crookedness of the ungenerous and malicious one.
With you as my yokemate, I would prevail over those doing battle  (with me).
### 14
Let this very Agni be superior to other fires, here where there gather a  prizewinning horse, a strong-handed lineage,
and the syllable [/the inexhaustible cow] with a thousand cattle-shelters. 15. This very Agni, who protects against the rapacious ones, should free his  kindler from constriction.
Well-born men circle around him.
### 16
Here is that Agni, receiving poured oblations in many places, whom the  master kindles, bringing the offering,
and whom the Hotar goes around at the rites.
### 17
In you, Agni, as masters we would pour many oblations that are  your own,
as we make the twin bridal processions at the sacrificial meal.
### 18
And, Agni, these oblations are most sought: unwearying, convey them  to the divine assembly.
Let them [=the gods] seek these, our sweet-scented (oblations).
### 19
Agni, do not hand us over to a lack of men. To neglect with its shabby  dress—do not hand us over to this.
Do not (hand) us (over) to hunger nor to the demon, o you who possess  the truth. Do not be angry at us in our house or in the forest.
### 20
Now direct my formulations upward, Agni. O god, you will sweeten  them for our generous (patrons).
We on both sides [=priests and patrons] would be in your generosity.  – Do you protect us always with your blessings.
### 21
O Agni, you are of easy summons and joy-bringing appearance. Be  brilliant with good brilliance, o son of strength. In company with you, let there be no falling short for our own lineage.  Let not the manly hero fade away among us.
### 22
Do not declare that we maintain them badly, Agni, since these fires are  kindled by the gods.
Let not bad thoughts from you, a god, reach us, not even because of  our confusion, o son of strength.
### 23
That mortal is rich, o Agni of beautiful face, who pours the oblation in  the immortal one.
He [=Agni or the mortal] establishes him [=the mortal or Agni] as one  who gains goods among the gods, the one to whom the inquiring
patron goes, seeking his ends.
### 24
Since you know of the great, easy passage, Agni, convey here to our  patrons lofty wealth,
by which, o powerful one, we would rejoice as those undiminished in  lifetime and having abundant good heroes.
### 25
Now direct my formulations upward, Agni. O god, you will sweeten  them for our generous (patrons).
We on both sides would be in your generosity. – Do you protect us
always with your blessings.

2 (518) Āprı̄
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
11 verses: triṣṭubh
This Āprī hymn offers several original images and turns of phrase, even as it follows  the prescribed sequence of invocations. In verse 2cd the gods who sweeten the offer ings are probably the assembly of the deities and divine objects who are invoked in  the hymn. Two similes complicate the second half of verse 5. The priests open the  doors so that the chariot, probably the sacrifice itself, can pass into the realm of the  gods. In 5cd with their oblations of ghee the priests anoint the many doors that lead  to the gods. In pāda c the doors are compared to cows licking a calf. We have sug gested that the “divine chariot,” the sacrifice, corresponds to the calf and that the  ghee-offerings at the Prayājas, the “fore-offerings,” are the “licks.” It is not entirely  clear why the doors are compared to unmarried girls in pāda d. The ritual situation  to which the verse refers, however, is explained by I.124.8, which describes anointed  brides-to-be who about to choose a husband (vrā́) at the assemblies (sámana) that  include prospective grooms. The two similes are united by the representation of  the dúraḥ, which are grammatically feminine, as females: mothers and brides. And  finally, rather unusually, verse 7 identifies the two divine Hotars, who are not actu ally named, each as Agni Jātavedas. The phrasing suggests that this verse may be  a reversal of V.9.1–2. In V.9.1c the poet says mánye tvā jātávedasam “I think you884 VII.2
[=Agni] to be Jātavedas,” and then in 2a, he calls Agni a Hotar. Alternatively, the  form jātávedasā could be an elliptical dual, as Geldner suggests, in which one of the  pair is Agni Jātavedas and the other the “inspired praise poet.”
The conclusion of the hymn, verses 8–11, is identical to III.4.8–11, so either  the Viśvāmitra Āprī hymn has borrowed from this Vasiṣṭha hymn or vice versa.  Presumably the first part of the hymn was enough to make each of the two hymns  sufficiently unique to its gotra.
### 1
Today find pleasure in our kindling wood, Agni. Blaze aloft, sending up  the smoke of the sacrifice.
Touch the back of heaven with your tufts of hair; you will extend
together with the rays of the sun.
### 2
With our sacrifices we will praise the greatness of Narāśaṃsa, worthy of  the sacrifice, among these,
the bright gods of strong resolve, the ones granting insight, who sweeten  both offerings [=oblations and words].
### 3
The very skillful lord to be invoked, the truth-speaking messenger  between the two world-halves,
Agni kindled by Manu—him would we like Manu ever exalt for you for  the sake of the rite.
### 4
Ritually serving, carrying it in a crouch, they spread ritual grass at the  fire with reverence.
Pouring (ghee) on it, o Adhvaryus, groom the ghee-backed, dappled  (ritual grass) with the oblation.
### 5
Serving the gods, very attentive, they have laid the doors that seek the  (divine) chariot open to the gods’ realm.
They jointly anoint like unwed girls in (marriage) assemblies the many  double (doors) that lick (the chariot) like two mother cows a calf.
### 6
And the two great, heavenly young women, Dawn and Night, like a  milk-cow that gives good milk,
the two generous ones sitting on the ritual grass, summoned by many,  worthy of the sacrifice—let them rest here for our safe passage.
### 7
I think you two inspired praise poets [=divine Hotars] at the sacrifices of  the sons of Manu are both Jātavedas and are to perform the sacrifice. Raise up our rite at our calls. You will win desirable rewards (for us)  among the gods.
### 8
Bhāratī along with the Bhāratīs, Iḷā along with the gods, Agni along with  the sons of Manu,
and Sarasvatī along with the Sārasvatas are near: let the three goddesses sit here on the ritual grass.
### 9
O god Tvaṣṭar, unbind for us this flow of semen and what prospers,  granting (that) from which a hero is born, fit for action and very skilled, who yokes up  the pressing stones and desires the gods.
### 10
O Lord of the Forest, send it [=the sacrificial animal] to the gods. Agni,  the Śamitar-priest, will sweeten the offering.
And it is he, the more real Hotar [=Agni], who will offer sacrifice, since  he knows the births of the gods.
### 11
Journey near here, o Agni, as you are kindled, on the same chariot with  Indra and the swift gods.
Let Aditi of good sons sit on our ritual grass. Svāhā! Let the immortal  gods rejoice!

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: triṣṭubh
Verses 1cd and 9cd share a similar structure with an opening relative clause and  concluding pāvakáḥ “pure” and thereby define the hymn. The last verse, which con tains the poet’s requests for blessings concluding with the usual Vasiṣṭha signature  line, thus stands outside of hymn’s principal development.
The hymn describes the emergence of fire from the friction sticks that give birth  to it. Agni breaks free of these fire-churning sticks as he is fanned into flame (vs.  2). He then appears as a new-born, who never grows old (vs. 3). His flames rapidly  advance over the wood (vs. 4), and then, in the middle verse of this principal section,  he becomes the recipient of offerings (vs. 5). The descriptions of the fire after that  point reflect its intensification through the offerings covered with ghee (vss. 6–7). The  “strongholds” in verse 7 and in verse 8 (if this is how the ellipsis in that verse is to be  completed) refer to Agni’s now brightly shining flames. Their brilliance cuts through  space, protecting the sacrificer and opening a way for the songs to reach the gods.
The hymn is notable especially for its skillful use of simile, especially in the first  half of the hymn. The poet compares Agni to a horse (vs. 2), a weapon (vs. 4), a  stallion (vs. 5), and a jewel (vs. 6), and he calls Agni a bull (vs. 3). In each case the  same verb describes the action of the fire and of the object to which it is compared.  So, for example, in verse 2 Agni and the horse both “snort” and both “stand free”— Agni of the fire-churning wood and the horse of its corral. In verse 5 the fire and a  stallion are both “groomed,” and in verse 6 both fire and a jewel “glow.” In 4d we  may have an exception to this pattern. In this case, the verb is vivekṣi which should  be from √viṣ “toil at,” and we reflect that analysis in our translation. But there is a  pun, for vivekṣi can formally be derived from √vic “sift,” an action that would apply  to the barley in the simile. That is to say, whereas the same action applies to the  simile and the frame in the previous examples, here the same verb form but not in  the same meaning applies to the wood and the barley.
886 VII.3
### 1
Make the god Agni along with the fires your best sacrificing messenger  in the rite—
he who is firmly established among mortals and possessing the truth,  the pure one with burning head, with ghee as his food.
### 2
He has snorted like a hungry horse in his pasture, when he has stood  free of his great enclosure.
Then the wind fans his flame, and as always your track is black. 3. You the new-born bull, o Agni, whose ageless (flames), being kindled,  climb upward—
your ruddy smoke goes toward heaven, for as our messenger, o Agni,  you speed to the gods.
### 4
You whose leading edge has spread out upon the earth when it has  hungrily encircled its food with its jaws—
your advance comes like a loosed weapon; wondrous one, you work  over (the wood) like barley with your tongue.
### 5
In the evening and at dawn our men groom just that very young Agni  like a stallion,
sharpening their guest in his womb. His flame shines when the bull is  offered oblations.
### 6
Your visage is lovely to see, o you of lovely face, when, like a jewel, you  glow nearby.
Your outburst comes like heaven’s thunder. Like the shimmering sun,  show your radiant beam.
### 7
In order that with our svāhā-call we would serve Agni for you all with  libations and ghee-drenched oblations,
protect us, Agni, by these immeasurable powers (of yours) and by your  hundred metal strongholds.
### 8
Your unassailable (strongholds)—either those which are for your  servant or those by which you will make a wide path for our
manly songs—
by these, son of strength, protect us altogether, both patrons and  singers, o Jātavedas.
### 9
When, gleaming like a (heat-)purified axe, he has come out, glowing in  his own form, in his own body—
who, eagerly sought, has been born in his two mothers [=the friction  sticks], the pure one strongly resolved to sacrifice to the gods— 10. Shine on us these things that bring good fortune, Agni. We would  acquire a resolve based on good perception.
Let all these things be for the praise singers and the chanter. – Do you  protect us always with your blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: triṣṭubh
According to Geldner, this hymn expresses the wish for a son or for a replace ment for a lost son. This is a wish found already in VII.1, but it is even more  strongly articulated here. The best evidence for this interpretation is verses 7–8,  which describe the importance of a son of one’s own. Nonetheless, in our view,  the subject of this hymn is more likely Agni than a son, and its concern is with a  fire that has not come or is just coming to birth. The poet wants a fire of his own,  which will bring wealth to him and preserve his life. To be sure, the hymn does  contain an implicit analogy between Agni and a son, who likewise brings wealth  and preserves the family.
One of the features of this hymn is the repetition of a word or of related words  in successive lines or verses: jagr̥bhré (3b) and gŕ̥bham (3c); uvóca (3c) and durókam (3d); agnír amŕ̥taḥ (4b), agnír amŕ̥tān (5b), and agnír amŕ̥tasya (6a); pári ṣadāma (6d)  and pariṣádyam (7a); and áraṇasya (7a) and áraṇaḥ (8a). Other repetitions occur at  a greater distance. Thus verse 8, the third from the last verse, has grábhāya (8a) and  ókaḥ (8c), echoing the repetitions within verse 3. This technique does not occur in  the first, introductory verse, nor in the last two verses, which are also VI.15.12 and  VII.3.10 respectively and which may have been borrowed from these hymns. These  verbal repetitions are a challenge to translate, particularly because in some cases the  poet uses the words in different senses. So, for example, amŕ̥ta refers to the “immor
tal” gods in verse 5 but to “living” human beings in verse 6. In verse 6 pári √sad describes the sacrificers “sitting around” the fire, but in verse 7 it probably refers to  sequestering something or keeping it separate by drawing a notional circle around it.
### 1
Bring forth your offering and your thought, well-purified, to the flaming  ray of light, to Agni,
who with wisdom goes among all races, the divine ones and those
descended from Manu.
### 2
Let Agni be sharp-witted, though of tender age, since he has been born  as his mother’s youngest,
who with his flaming teeth completely grips the pieces of wood. He  completely eats his food all at once, even though it be abundant.
### 3
In the company and before the face of this god, the luminous one whom  mortals have accepted as their own,
who is at home with human ownership, but beyond domestication, Agni  flames for Āyu.
### 4
Here the prescient poet has been installed among non-poets, immortal  Agni among mortals.
Do not become angry with us here, o strong one. We would ever have  good thoughts in your company.
888 VII.5
### 5
Who has sat here upon the womb made by the gods—for Agni has  surpassed the deathless (gods) in his resolve (to sacrifice)—
that all-nurturing child do plants, trees, and the land carry.
### 6
Because Agni is the master of what is free of death [=alive] and  abundant, (because) he is the master of giving a wealth of men,
lacking men, let us not (sit around) you, o strong one; lacking lifebreath  or friendship, let us not sit around (you).
### 7
Because the legacy of an outsider is to be “sat around” [=sequestered],  might we be lords of our own wealth.
What is born of another is no posterity (for us), o Agni. Do not milk  dry the paths (even) of an inconspicuous man.
### 8
For an outsider, (even one) of great kindness, is not to be accepted as  one’s own, nor is one born of another’s belly to be well regarded in
one’s thinking.
He returns again to his home. Let the overpowering, prizewinning
horse come here to us anew.
### 9
You, Agni—protect (us) from the rapacious one, and you, mighty one— (protect) us from reproach.
Let the smoke-enwrapped (oblation) come entirely to you, to the fold  (of the gods); and let thousandfold desirable wealth (come) entirely.
### 10
Shine on us these things that bring good fortune, Agni. We would  acquire a resolve based on good perception.
Let all these things be for the praise singers and the chanter. – Do you  protect us always with your blessings.

5 (521) Agni Vaiśvānara
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
9 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn invokes Agni as both the fire on earth and the sun in heaven. More spe cifically, Agni is a tribal fire, which here represents an aggregation of clans in the  Pūru tribe (vs. 3). This hymn thus accords with VII.19.3, in which Indra also sup ports the Pūru tribe, but contrasts with VII.18.13, in which Indra supports Sudās,  the enemy of the Pūru. As Proferes (2007: 46–49) details, it is as a tribal fire and  as the sun that Agni is called Vaiśvānara, a name repeated in each of the first five  verses and then again in the last two (8–9).
The hymn begins with a statement of Agni’s presence in heaven and on earth,  nurtured by both the gods and priests (vs. 1). In the second verse Agni is called  the master of both flowing and pooling waters, a theme echoed in verse 8, the  second to last verse, in which Agni is asked to send the “refreshing drink,” which  might be the rain for humans or the soma for the gods or both. Having descended to earth, Agni’s radiance extends to the Ārya clans (vs. 2cd). In verse 3 the  víśaḥ... aśiknīḥ “dark clans” are Dasyus (vs. 6), but they are not dark because they  are “dark-skinned,” as the description is often interpreted, but rather because they  represent powers of darkness opposed to the Āryas (cf. Hock 1999). Note that  the brilliance of Agni in 3cd breaks apart the “dark clans” and, as light, disperses  darkness. Or likewise in verse 6 Agni drives away the Dasyus, providing a “broad  light” for Āryas. As fire and sun, Agni extends his light throughout the worlds  (vs. 4). In verse 5, the middle verse of the hymn, the poet concretizes Agni as the  present sacrificial fire, who guards and prospers the different communities and as  both the sacrificial fire and the sun, both of which appear in the early morning as  beacons of the day.
### 1
Bring forth a song to the mighty Agni, to the spoked wheel of heaven  and earth,
who as Vaiśvānara has grown strong in the lap of all the immortals  through the watchful (priests).
### 2
Sought after in heaven, Agni has been placed on earth as the leader of  the rivers and the bull of standing waters.
He radiates outward toward the clans descended from Manu: Vaiśvānara  having grown strong according to his wish.
### 3
The dark clans went breaking ranks, leaving their supplies, from fear of you, o Vaiśvānara, when you shone, breaking their strongholds, blazing for  Pūru, o Agni.
### 4
Heaven and earth, (each) in its three parts, follow your commandment, o  Agni Vaiśvānara.
You stretch throughout the two world-halves with your radiance, blazing  with your inexhaustible blaze.
### 5
Resounding ghee-rich songs—bellowing tawny mares—follow you, Agni, the lord of settlements, the charioteer of riches, Vaiśvānara, the beacon  of the dawns and of the days.
### 6
The good (gods) installed their lordship in you, for they find pleasure in  your resolve, o you having Mitra’s might.
You drove the Dasyus away from their home, o Agni, giving birth to  broad light for the Ārya.
### 7
Being born in the highest heaven, at once you protect the fold on every  side like Vāyu.
Giving birth to living beings, you cry out, doing service to their
descendants, Jātavedas.
### 8
Send the heaven-bright refreshing drink for us, o Agni Vaiśvānara, o  Jātavedas,
by which you swell your bounty and broad fame for the pious mortal, o  you who grant all wishes.
890 VII.6
### 9
Bind wealth that brings many cattle to our generous patrons, o Agni, as  well as the prize of victory worthy of fame.
O Vaiśvānara, along with the Rudras and Vasus, offer great protection to  us, o Agni.

6 (522) Agni Vaiśvānara
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
In its first verse this poem implicitly connects Agni with Varuṇa and Indra. In 1ab  Agni is called a “universal king and lord” to be honored “by the settlements.” This  description recalls Varuṇa and his rule over settled communities. Then in the second  hemistich Agni’s acts are explicitly compared to the heroic deeds of Indra during  war. The description of Agni as the “breaker”—if that is the meaning of dārú in  1d—is appropriate to him: in X.69.3d the poet asks of Agni sá vā́jaṃ darṣi “Break  out victory’s prize.” But the word also anticipates puraṃdará “breaker of strong
holds” in 2c, here an epithet of Agni but normally one of Indra. In 2cd the two  gods, Indra and Varuṇa, are combined in Agni through the description of him as  puraṃdará and through reference to his vratá “commandment,” a term that is con ceptually and etymologically connected to Varuṇa. But then in verse 3 Agni takes  on the persona of Indra more exclusively as one who pursues the Paṇis, who are the  great enemies of Indra in his destruction of the Vala cave. The reference to Agni as  the one who brings the dawn in verses 4–5 is appropriate to the fire of the morning  sacrifice, but it also continues the reference to the Vala story, telling of the release  of the dawns. In verse 5cd Nahuṣ is the ancestor of the Nahuṣa, a tribe of whom  Agni takes possession. In I.31.11 Agni is the clanlord of the Nahuṣa, but it is still  not clear why they are mentioned here, although doing so does bring Agni’s action  down to earth and perhaps into the present. The last two verses give Agni posses
sion of the whole earth, including the goods and peoples on it.
### 1
(I proclaim) the praise of the universal king and lord, of the man to be  celebrated by the settlements.
Extolling the deeds of the mighty one—I extol the breaker—I proclaim  them like those of Indra.
### 2
They urge on the poet and beacon (of the sacrifice), the wellspring and  light beam from the stone, the luck and rule of the two world-halves. By my songs, I seek to gain the ancient and great commandments of  Agni the breaker of strongholds.
### 3
Down with those of no intelligence, those tying in knots, those of  disdainful words: the Paṇis, not giving hospitality, not giving strength,  not giving sacrifices. Onward and onward Agni has pursued those Dasyus. The first has made  the last to be without sacrifices.
### 4
The best of men, who by his powers has put those (Dawns) in the east,  though they were finding joy in the western darkness—
I shall sing to that Agni, master of the good, the one unable to be bent,  who subdues those doing battle.
### 5
Who bent the ramparts by his deadly weapons, who made the Dawns to  have our compatriot [=Agni] as their husband,
he, the young Agni, having halted the (clans) of Nahuṣ, made (those)  clans give tribute through his powers.
### 6
Under whose protection all the peoples approach in their separate ways,  asking for his favor,
Agni Vaiśvānara has sat here in the lap of the two world-halves, of his  parents, according to his wish.
### 7
The god Vaiśvānara has taken the goods on the land for his own at the  rising of the sun.
From the lower sea and from the higher one, from heaven and from  earth, Agni has taken them.

7 (523) Agni
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The poet invokes the powerful Agni—the god who acts with strength (sahasānám) in  the first verse and is summoned as the “son of strength” (sūno sahasaḥ) in the last.  Within this recursive frame the poet follows the descent of Agni from the heaven onto  the earth. In 1d Agni runs at “a measured pace” and is found “among the gods in his  own person,” that is, in the form of the burning sun. He is then invited to journey to  earth (vs. 2) and to the sacrificial place as a participant in the rite (vs. 3). Still, Agni  remains simultaneously earthly and heavenly. His “two mothers” or “mother and  father” in 3c are Earth and Heaven, but they can also be the two fire-churning sticks,  the aráṇī̆. In verse 4 Agni’s birth is set squarely on earth and at the sacrifice, where he  assumes his role as chief priest of the rite (vss. 4–5). Verse 6 presents an interesting  problem since it is not clear who is spoken about. In our view the subject is most likely  the gods, to whom the poet now returns at the end of the hymn, thus balancing the  reference to them in verses 1–2. But pādas a and cd can also describe the patrons of  the sacrifice and b can parenthetically refer to the priests, as Geldner suggests. This  ambiguity is likely intentional, allowing a double reference to gods and humans.
### 1
For you I shall urge on Agni like a prizewinning horse, the very god  acting with strength, by my homage:
892 VII.8
“Become for us the knowing messenger of the rite!” Running with
measured pace, he has been found among the gods in his own person. 2. Journey here along your own paths, o Agni, as the delighting one who  takes pleasure in companionship with the gods;
(journey) here along the back of the earth, bellowing with outbursts,  burning everything, burning the wood at will with your jaws.
### 3
The sacrifice is turned eastward, for the ritual grass is rightly laid. Agni is  pleased, invoked like a Hotar,
being summoned here to the two mothers [=Earth and Heaven] who  fulfill all desires, from whom, o youngest one, you have been born as  the very kind one.
### 4
At once the discerning descendants of Manu gave birth in the rite to the  charioteer who is theirs.
As their clanlord, he has been placed in the home of the clans—he the  delighting Agni of honeyed speech, possessing the truth.
### 5
Having come here, the chosen conveyor (of oblations) has been seated at  the seat of men—Agni, the ritual formulator and distributor,
whom Heaven and Earth have made strong, the one fulfilling all desires,  to whom the Hotar sacrifices.
### 6
These surpass everything through their heavenly brilliance—the manly  ones who fashioned the solemn utterance and its desirable reward,
who, heeding them, extend the clans and who will reflect upon this,
my truth.
### 7
And now we Vasiṣṭhas beseech you, the master of good things, o Agni,  son of strength.
You have obtained refreshment for the singers of praise and for our  generous (patrons). – Do you protect us always with your blessings.

7 verses: triṣṭubh
Commenting on verse 4, Proferes (2007: 37) rightly says that this Agni, the fire of  the Bharatas, is linked to the military power of the tribe, and it is he, not the king  or the warriors, who is credited for the victory over the enemy tribe of the Pūrus.  There are hints of the extent of Agni’s power to repel the Pūrus in the repetition  of ví “afar” in verses 2, 3, and 4. Likewise, the poet describes how Agni, the son  of strength (vs. 7), becomes mighty (vs. 2) and makes his body strong (vs. 5). In an  interesting twist, Agni’s bodily strength, which is marked by his brightness, will  drive human bodily illness into darkness (vs. 6). 1. Our compatriot king is kindled by our homage, upon whose face ghee is  offered.
Our men urgently summon him with oblations. Here, at the head of the  dawns, Agni has been set ablaze.

And here has this very great one been found—the delighting Hotar, the  young Agni of Manu.
Let loose, he has spread afar his radiance upon the earth. Whose
wheel-rim is black, he has grown mighty by the plants.

In what way, Agni, will you shine our intricate hymn afar, and what  self-resolve will you put into action when you are proclaimed?
When would we become lords and winners of hard-gained wealth that  brings success, o very generous one?
### 4
Farther and farther is this Agni of Bharata famed when his lofty  radiance gleams afar like the sun.
He who dominated the Pūru in battles blazes as our glowing,
godly guest.
### 5
There will surely be many offerings poured in you, and you will become  benevolent in all your faces.
Though praised, o Agni, you are (already) renowned, as you are being  sung. By yourself make your own body strong, o well-born one.
### 6
Here is our speech: winning hundreds along with thousands, it should be  born doubly lofty for Agni,
so that he, the smasher of demons, will become for his praisers and
his friend [=the singer] brilliant good luck that chases sickness into
hiding.

9 (525) Agni
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
The appearance of Agni as the fire of the morning sacrifice and also as the sun  marks the beginning of the sacrifice, and it is he who establishes the two signs of  the sacrifice: the oblations given to the gods and the wealth received in return by  humans (vs. 1). The exchange between sacrificers and gods is reasserted at the end  of the penultimate verse (vs. 5cd), which urges Agni to sacrifice to the gods in order  that they will benefit humans. The theme of exchange is continued in verse 2a, since894 VII.9
Agni’s “strong resolve” is to sacrifice, and as a result of this resolve he opens the  pens of the Paṇis and, as in the Vala story, lets loose cattle, symbols of both wealth  and the dawns. In the latter part of this verse the function of Agni in promoting  the exchange between gods and sacrificers is suggested by word play that turns on  the ambiguity of arká, which can mean either “chant” or “flame,” and of the com
pound purubhójas, either “bringing sustenance” or “consuming sustenance.” That  is, Agni purifies either the chant that creates food for humans or the flames that  consume it on behalf of the gods.
In 3ab, in a different kind of word play, Agni bears the names of three gods, all  of whom, like Agni, have roles in carrying out the ritual: Aditi is the embodiment of  the “Guiltlessness” of one who performs the rite correctly, Vivasvant is the first sac rificer (as Geldner notes), and Mitra is the deity of the sacrificial alliance between  gods and humans. The name Vivasvant may also carry its appellative significance  “shining forth,” which would also fit the fire. In 3cd Agni is brought into connection  with two groups of goddesses, who are complicit in the birth of Agni: the Dawns,  with whom he appears in the early morning, and the Waters, who give birth to Agni  and place him in the “fruitful” plants, from which the fire emerges. There is a final  word play in verse 6c, where puruṇīthā́...jarasva can mean that, as a god, Agni  should awaken to the musical modes of the ritual chants or, as a priest, should sing  musical modes through the sounds of the fire. There is even battle imagery in the  latter part of the hymn: in verse 4 Agni enters the “melee” and in verse 5 with Agni’s  help Vasiṣṭha destroys the Jarūtha, probably a demonized enemy who is part of the  Vasiṣṭha family lore. In that context, puruṇīthā́ could also have a secondary refer ence to warriors’ strategems by which wealth is won.
### 1
The lover of the Dawns has awakened from their lap, the delighting  Hotar, the best of sage poets, the pure one.
He sets in place the beacon for both races: the oblations among the gods  and wealth among the good ritual performers.
### 2
He of strong resolve, who (opens) up the doors of the Paṇis as he purifies  the chant that brings much sustenance for us,
he, the delighting Hotar and the housemaster of the clans, has become  visible, across the darkness of the nights.
### 3
The sage poet who is never misled—Aditi and Vivasvant, Mitra of good  fellowship and our kind guest—
with shimmering radiance, he radiates at the head of the Dawns. The  infant of the Waters has entered the fruitful ones.
### 4
The one to be invoked by you among the generations of Manu, entering  the melee, Jātavedas blazed.
He who radiates forth with a radiance beautiful to see—cows awaken in  response to him as he is kindled.
### 5
O Agni, travel on your mission toward the gods—intend us no harm!— along with the band that creates poetic formulations. Sacrifice to Sarasvatī, to the Maruts, to the Aśvins, and to the Waters,  and to all the gods so that they grant wealth.
### 6
Kindling you, o Agni, Vasiṣṭha smashed Jarūtha. Sacrifice to Plenitude  for riches.
Jātavedas, awaken to many modes. – Do you protect us always with your  blessings.

10 (526) Agni
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The poet is particularly fond of alliteration and assonance, which he uses exten sively in the hymn. The first words of the first verse uṣó ná jāráḥ echo its last  uśatī́r ajīgaḥ, and throughout the verse the poet pairs initial sounds: pr̥thú pā́jaḥ,  dávidyutad dī́dyat, and bhāti bhāṣā́, in what may be a sonic representation of the  flickering fire repeatedly flaming. In verses 2 and 3 he strings sets of three repeti tions: dravád dūtó devayā́vā (2d) and susaṃdŕ̥śaṃ suprátīkaṃ sváñcam (3c). He then  returns to pairs in verse 4: rudráṃ rudrébhiḥ, ādityébhir áditim. These repetitions  abruptly stop at the last verse, which states matter-of-factly the principal theme of  the hymn first enunciated at verse 2: Agni brings offerings to the gods in heaven and  wealth to mortals on earth. There is a variation on this theme in verse 4, in which  Agni not only conveys oblations to the gods (as in vs. 3), but also conveys the gods  to earth at the sacrificial place.
### 1
Like the lover of Dawn, flaring, shining, and blazing, he has held up his  broad face.
The bull, the blazing fallow bay, radiates with his radiance. Urging on  our eager insights, he has awakened them.
### 2
Like the sun, at the dawning of the Dawns he has shone, stretching forth  the sacrifice, like fire-priests their thought.
Distinguishing the kinds (of gods and mortals), the god Agni (comes)  here at a run as a messenger, seeking the gods and best bringing gain  (to mortals).
### 3
Our songs and thoughts, serving the gods, come to Agni, seeking a share  in wealth,
to him of lovely appearance, of lovely face, and of lovely look, to him  conveying oblations as the spoked wheel of the descendants of Manu. 4. O Agni, convey Indra to us along with the Vasus, lofty Rudra along with  the Rudras,
Aditi belonging to all peoples along with the Ādityas, and Br̥haspati  granting all wishes along with the reciters of verses.
896 VII.11
### 5

11 (527) Agni
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The keywords in this hymn are ā́ “hither” and ihá “here.” The poet asks that Agni  come “hither” (vs. 1c) to sacrifice “here” (vss. 1d, 3c). And not only should Agni  come, but he should also bring the gods “hither” (vs. 5a) to enjoy the sacrifice  “here” (vs. 5b). The last pāda—excluding the Vasiṣṭha signature pāda—presents an  interesting twist, for the poet asks that this sacrifice, the sacrifice that is at this place  on earth, that is here where he has asked Agni to come and here where he is to bring  the gods, be placed “in heaven among the gods” (vs. 5c). At the end, therefore, what  is present and local should become celestial and divine.
Verse 3 of this hymn presents an additional puzzle. What does it mean when  it says that good things become visible in Agni “three times at night”? Following  Sāyaṇa, Geldner argues that “night” here means the whole day, and therefore the  reference is to the three soma-pressings. Recognizing the difficulty of this interpre
tation, Oldenberg wonders whether there might be a reference here to an Atirātra or  “overnight” rite. We agree and think that the reference here is to the rites that take  place at night. But what rites these are or why “good things” are visible in the fire  during them remains unclear.
### 1
You are the great sign of the rite; without you the immortals find no  elation.
Travel hither in the same chariot with all the gods. Agni, take your seat  here as the first Hotar.
### 2
Bringing offerings, the descendants of Manu always invoke you, the  nimble one, to act as messenger.
Upon whose sacred grass you sit with the gods, o Agni, for him the days  become bright shining.
### 3
Three times at night, good things become visible within you for the pious  mortal.
As you did for Manu, o Agni, sacrifice here to the gods. Become our  messenger, protecting us from curses.
### 4
Agni is master of the rite reaching aloft; Agni, of every offering that  is made,
for the good (gods) rejoice in his intention, and so the gods established  him as the conveyor of oblations.

Place this sacrifice here in heaven among the gods. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.

This brief hymn describes Agni’s appearance “in his own home” (vs. 1b) and “in the  household” (vs. 2b), but although he is a domestic fire, Agni also extends to heaven  and earth and the four directions (vs. 1cd). Agni’s principal function here is to pro tect the household against unnamed difficulties (vss. 2a, 2c) and accusations (vs. 2c).  It is because he protects the family that he is Varuṇa and Mitra (vs. 3a), since these  two gods guard the structure of the household and of the larger society.
### 1
We have come with great reverence to the youngest one, who, kindled,  shines in his own home—
to him of shimmering radiance between the two wide world-halves, to  him facing out in every direction, receiving the well-poured offering. 2. Overcoming all difficulties by his greatness, Agni is praised in the  household as Jātavedas.
He will guard us from difficulty and reproach, (guard) both us, who are  singing, and our generous patrons.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: triṣṭubh
In each of the three verses of this hymn, the poet calls Agni vaíśvānara (vss. 1d, 2d,  3c), thereby identifying the emerging ritual fire with the rising sun. Because Agni is  the sun, he blazes everywhere, smashes enemies, fills heaven and earth with his light,  releases the gods from the curse (of darkness), looks upon all beings, and encom
passes the earth. The poet brings to Agni his hymn as an offering in the hope that  with these powers Agni will bring success to the poet’s words.
898 VII.14
### 1
Bring forth to Agni—blazing everywhere, granting insight, smashing  (enemy) lords—our thought, our vision.
Being pleased (with it), I bring it, like an offering on the ritual grass, to  Vaiśvānara for him to hold fast to our thoughts.

This hymn marks the raising of the sacrificial fire by placing kindling, by pouring  ghee, and by reciting praises and invocations, which verbal products, as much as  the wood and ghee, bring the fire to life. Noteworthy in this hymn is the repetition  of an emphatic vayám “we” at the beginning of each pāda in verse 2, continuing its  placement in 1d. The poet is drawing the god’s attention not only to the forms of  ritual service he is being offered, but also to the poet and his people as those offer
ing that service.

To Jātavedas with our kindling wood, to the god with our invocations to  the gods,

## 15
15 (531) Agni
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
15 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥
This hymn divides into five tr̥cas. The first triplet of verses defines Agni as the clan  fire, which lives close to the family and protects it. In the second triplet Agni is  invoked to be present as the fire of the sacrifice. Structurally, the second triplet  replicates the first, since the second two verses in each form a single syntactic unit  that begins with a relative clause and continues with an imperative. This repeated  structure iconically suggests the identity of the clan fire and the sacrificial fire, and  in the third triplet the sacrificial fire and the clan fire are explicitly blended. Agni  represents the clanlord and he receives the sacrificial oblations (vs. 7). Through the  sacrifice Agni provides the clan with “heroes,” the male children who guarantee the  prosperity of the clan. In verse 9, as also in VII.1.14, the ákṣarā refers to both a  syllable—its primary meaning—and a cow that always gives milk. Thus, the “syl lable” of the poets comes with thousands of syllables, and because their speech is  an inexhaustible cow, it brings thousands of cattle.
The fourth tr̥ca takes Agni into the sphere of the minor Ādityas, Savitar, Bhaga,  and the mysterious Diti, who is here the personification of giving embodied in the  sacrificial fire. Geldner suggests that Diti is the female counterpart of Bhaga, but  Diti is as easily male (and we believe more likely so) as female. Diti and Aditi, the  mother of the Ādityas, appear to be in a systematic grammatical relationship, with  the latter being a negated version of the former. But here Diti is not the opposite  of Aditi but seemingly one of her children, since Diti appears alongside other  Ādityas.
If the fourth tr̥ca emphasizes the gifts of the Agni, the last appeals for his power  to protect from bad times and evil people.
### 1
Pour the oblation in his mouth for him to be reverently approached, for  him granting rewards,
who is closest friendship for us.
### 2
Who has sat down in every house, (presiding) over the five peoples— the sage poet and houselord, the youthful one—
### 3
Let him, Agni, guard our household possessions in every direction, and let him protect us from difficult straits.
### 4
Now I give birth to a new praise song for Agni, the falcon of heaven. Will he not win for us what is good?
### 5
Whose glories are eagerly sought to be seen, like the wealth of one rich in  heroes—
(the glories of him) who flames at the beginning of the sacrifice—
### 6
Let him pursue this vaṣaṭ-call. Agni takes pleasure in our songs,
as the best sacrificer, as the conveyor of oblations.
900 VII.16
### 7
We would establish you as the brilliant one, o clanlord to be
attained, o god,
as the one having good heroes, o Agni, receiving the poured offering. 8. Shine throughout the nights and dawns. Through you we have
good fires;
seeking us, you have good heroes.
### 9
Our men, inspired poets, come to you with their visions in order to  win gain,
as does their syllable [/their inexhaustible cow] bringing thousands.

The brightly blazing, immortal Agni wards off demons—
the blazing pure one to be invoked.

Bring us gifts, being their master, o young (son) of strength,

with your hottest (fires).

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
12 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas
The hymn emphasizes the exchange mediated by Agni, who takes the oblations to  the gods (or brings the gods to the oblations) and who offers sustenance to the sac rificers (see esp. vs. 2cd). Because he thus nourishes both gods and humans, he is the  “child of nourishment” (vs. 1). The poet repeatedly mentions the patron or patrons  of the rite alongside the priests. Agni himself is not only the Hotar, who recites, and  the Potar, who purifies the soma, but also the householder, who is the patron of the  rite (vs. 5). In verse 6 the poet calls on Agni to sharpen not only the priests but also  the one who “praises well” and “is skillful,” a combination of the ability to recite  and the ability to perform the rites. The latter may be a priest, but it might be again  the householder, who is also a participant in the rite and who owns, in a sense, all of  the priestly functions. In verses 7–10 the poet asks Agni to bless generous patrons, who give cattle (vs. 7) and horses along with other gifts (vs. 10). In the final two  verses the poet addresses his fellow priests, urging them to prepare ample offerings  for the gods, but at the end he especially mentions the rewards of wealth and good  men for “the pious man,” who again is likely the householder.
### 1
For you with this homage I summon Agni, the child of nourishment, the dear, most visible circle of spokes that makes the rite good, the
immortal messenger for all.
### 2
He will hitch up his two flame-red (horses) that bring nurture to all. He  will run swiftly, when he receives the well-poured offering.
With its good formulations and with good labor, the sacrifice belongs  to the good (gods), and the divine gift belongs to the peoples.
### 3
Upward has risen the flame belonging to him, the one giving rewards,  when he receives the poured offering;
upward the ruddy smoke, touching heaven: our men kindle Agni.
### 4
We make you our most glorious messenger. Convey the gods here to  pursue (our oblations).
Son of strength, give everything that nourishes mortals; give that which  we beg of you.
### 5
Agni, you are the houselord; you the Hotar in the rite;
you the attentive Potar, o you who grant all wishes—sacrifice and seek  out a desirable reward (for us).
### 6
Create treasure for the sacrificer, o you of good resolve, for you are the  grantor of treasure.
Sharpen us—every priest—upon the truth, and also him who, praising  well, is skillful.
### 7
Agni, let our patrons be dear to you, who receive the well-poured  offering—
they, the generous guides of the peoples, who distribute pens of cattle. 8. Those in whose house Iḷā [/Libation] sits down, with her hands of ghee  and filled to the brim—
save them from deceit and blame, o powerful one. Hold out to us
far-famed protection.
### 9
As the more knowing conveyor, with your delighting tongue and  your mouth
convey wealth to our generous (patrons), Agni, and sweeten our gift of  oblations.

Who give gifts and rewards of horses with a desire for great fame— rescue them from difficult straits with your rescuers and with your
hundred fortresses, o youngest one.

The god Wealth-Giver [=Agni] wishes your full outpouring.
Pour it out or fill it up: only then will the god honor you.

Paijavana’s Dānastuti (22–25)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
25 verses: triṣṭubh
This very famous hymn, the first in Vasiṣṭha’s Indra cycle, relates, if we can use so  positive a term, the so-called Battle of the Ten Kings, in which King Sudās and his  Bharata followers, with Indra on their side, defeat an alliance of ten kings, which includes their former allies, the Pūrus. The hymn has long been used as a major  source for the reconstruction of R̥gvedic history, perhaps somewhat too credu lously, as the description of the battle is anything but clear and is also clearly full  of puns, derisive word plays, phonological deformations of the names of oppo nents, and other poetic tricks, all couched in slangy language. Since the “historical”  dimension of the hymn has been fully treated elsewhere (see especially Schmidt  1980 and Witzel 1995a), we will not discuss it further here.
The hymn falls into three parts. Verses 1–4 recall the aid that Indra has given us  in the past and ask for his help and gifts now. The poet names himself at the very  end of verse 4, which forms a clever ring with verse 1: the description of Indra in  1d, ... vásu... vániṣṭhaḥ “best gainer of goods,” is condensed into the poet’s own  name in 4d, vás(u)(ván)iṣṭhaḥ → vásiṣṭhaḥ. The language and contents of these first  four verses are well-crafted but unremarkable.
The battle proper and its immediate aftermath occupy verses 5–21; the battle  itself takes place in and around the Paruṣṇī River (see esp. vss. 8–10), whose course  seems to have been diverted during the battle and in which a number of the com batants seem to have drowned. The account, especially the earlier verses, seems to  mirror the confusion and chaos of battle itself (reminiscent on a much smaller scale  of Tolstoy’s great accounts of the unintelligible disorder of battle in War and Peace,  or of Stephen Crane’s in The Red Badge of Courage). The confusion begins to sort  itself out as Indra’s role becomes more prominently featured. It is emphasized sev eral times that the forces of Sudās were outnumbered but that Indra was able to  marshal this overmastered force to defeat their foes (esp. vss. 14, 17). This section  ends with several verses celebrating the victory and Indra’s benevolence (20–21).
The final four verses (22–25) are a dānastuti, praising the extravagant gifts of  Sudās to the poet, ending (vs. 25) by commending Sudās to the protection of the  Maruts.
### 1
Since with you beside (them), o Indra, our fathers, the singers, also won  all things of value—
because in you are the good milking cows, in you the horses—you are the  best gainer of goods for one who serves the gods.
### 2
Because you are simply dwelling peacefully like a king with his wives,  help (us) throughout the days, being preeminent as a wise poet.
O bounteous one, ornament our hymns with cows and horses; whet us,  who are devoted to you, for wealth.
### 3
These gladdening hymns, contending with each other here, seeking the  gods, have reverently approached you.
Let the path of your wealth lead our way. Might we be in your good  thought, Indra, in your shelter.
### 4
Wishing to milk you like a milk-cow in good pasture, I, Vasiṣṭha, have  dispatched sacred formulations to you.
Everyone says that you alone are my herdsman. Let Indra come to our  good thought.904 VII.18
### 5
Even the floods that had spread out—Indra made them into fords easy  to cross for Sudās.
Śimyu, who was vaunting himself above our newer speech—he [=Indra]  made him into the flotsam of the rivers and his taunts (too).
### 6
Turvaśa Yakṣu (the “sacrificer”) was himself the offering cake—also the  Matsyas [“fish”], whetted down (in their quest) for wealth, like fish  in water.
The Bhr̥gus and the Druhyus (just) followed orders. (Former) comrade  crossed (former) comrade on the two opposing (sides).
### 7
The Pakthas [“cooked oblations”?] and the Bhalānases [“raiders”?]  spoke out, and the Alinas, the Viṣānins, and the Śivas:
“The feasting companion of the Ārya [=Indra?], who led (us?) hither— with desire for cattle for the Tr̥tsus he has gone with battle against  superior men [=us].”
### 8
The ill-intentioned ones without insight, causing Aditi to abort,  diverted (the course of) the (river) Paruṣṇī.
With his greatness he [=Indra? Turvaśa?] enveloped the earth, being  master (of it). The poet lay there, being perceived as (just) a
(sacrificial) animal.
### 9
They came to the Paruṣṇī, to a failed end as if to their (real) goal. Not  even the swift one made it home for supper.
Indra made those without alliance (to us) subject to Sudās, those,  easy to thrust away, who, (though) in Manu’s (race), were of gelded  speech.
### 10
They went like cows without a cowherd from a pasture, (though)  seeming (to go) to an alliance properly concluded—
the Pr̥śnigus, propelled down to the dappled one [/P(a)r(u)ṣṇī]. The  teams and the battlers [?] followed orders.
### 11
He who as king with desire for fame has strewn down the one and  twenty peoples of the two Vaikarṇas,
just as a wonder-worker “whets down” the ritual grass on the seat. The  champion Indra made a gush of them.
### 12
Then famous old Kavaṣa he wrenched down into the waters, and *Anu  and Druhyu—he with the mace in his arms.
The ones devoted to you, who cheered you on, (were) choosing there  your partnership for their partnership.
### 13
In an instant Indra split open all their fortified places, their seven  strongholds, with his might.
He shared out the patrimony of the descendant of Anu to Tr̥tsu. We  defeated the Pūru of scornful speech at the rite of distribution.
### 14
The cow-seeking Anu and Druhyu people fell down to sleep—sixty  hundred, six thousand (of them).
(But on the other side there were just) sixty heroes with six on top, in  search of (Indra’s) favor. All these are the manly deeds of Indra. 15. These Tr̥tsus, constantly laboring alongside Indra, ran like waters  released downward.
The ill-allied ones, meting (their supplies) out with a miser’s eye, (yet)  left behind all their goodies for Sudās.
### 16
The (mere) half a hero, who drinks the cooked oblation without Indra,  who vaunts himself, did he thrust away to the ground.
Indra confounded the battle fury of the one who confounds the battle  fury (of others). He took to the course of the path, being master of it. 17. Even with a feeble thing he performed this unique (deed): he smote even  the lioness with a wether.
Indra hewed down the poles with a pin. He handed over all the goodies  to Sudās.
### 18
“Because one after the other, the rivals become subject to you, procure  the subjugation even of vaunting Bheda.
Who(ever) commits an offense against mortals who praise, smash your  sharp mace down on him, o Indra.”
### 19
The Yamunā (River) helped Indra, as did the Tr̥tsus. He despoiled  Bheda there entirely,
and the Ajas, Śighras, and the Yakṣus brought horses’s heads as tribute. 20. Neither your favors nor your riches, o Indra, can be entirely surveyed,  through the previous dawns, nor through the current ones.
You smote even the one who fancied himself a little god. You cut down  Śambara from the lofty (mountain) by yourself.
### 21
Those from (this?) house who reached elation in devotion to you— Parāśara, Śatayātu, Vasiṣṭha—
they did not neglect their partnership with you, who provided for
(them). So now day-bright (dawns) will dawn forth for the patrons.
### 22
Two hundred (head) of cattle from the descendant of Devavant, two  chariots carrying brides from Sudās—
deserving the gift of Paijavana, o Agni, I circle around (it), like a Hotar  the seat (of the sacrificial victim), as I “rasp” [=sing].
### 23
The four gift(-horse)s of Paijavana, along with their allotted (gear),  covered with pearls, (convey) me exclusively.
The silvery ones of Sudās who tread the earth convey me and my
progeny, for my progeny to be famed.
### 24
He whose fame the Apportioner has apportioned to every head between  the two wide world-halves,
they hymn (him) just as the seven streams do Indra. He “whetted
down” Yudhyāmadhi at the moment of encounter.
### 25
You superior men, you Maruts, accompany this (man) here, like  Divodāsa, the father of Sudās.
Give aid to the aspiration of Paijavana—lordly power difficult to attain  and unaging—(as he) seeks (your) favor.

19 (535) Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
11 verses: triṣṭubh
The first half of this hymn (vss. 1–5) celebrates various victories of Indra, giving  aid both to men of the mythic past (e.g., Kutsa, vs. 2) and those of the present,  especially King Sudās (vss. 3, also 6), the leader also in the Battle of the Ten Kings  treated in the preceding, well-known hymn (VII.18). The allegiances and enmities  of that hymn are strikingly different here: for example, Indra helps the Pūru king in  this hymn (vs. 3), whereas in VII.18 the Pūrus are the enemy.
Beginning with verse 6 we attempt to mobilize the powers and protection that  Indra has previously provided for us, and as usual we offer praise in return.
### 1
Who, like a fearsome sharp-horned bull, alone rouses forth all the  communities;
(you) who hold forth to the better (soma-)presser the patrimony and  possessions of each and every impious man—
### 2
Just you, o Indra, helped Kutsa, while seeking fame for yourself with  your own body in the clash,
when for him you weakened the Dāsa Śuṣṇa bringing bad harvest, doing  your best for Arjuna’s offspring.
### 3
You, o bold one, boldly helped on Sudās, whose oblation is worth  pursuing, with all forms of help;
you helped on Trasadasyu, son of Purukutsa, and Pūru in the winning  of land, in the smashing of obstacles.
### 4
You—whose mind is inclined toward men in their pursuit of the gods— along with men you smash many obstacles, you of the fallow bays;
you put to sleep the Dasyu Cumuri and Dhuni, easy to smash, for
Dabhīti.
### 5
Yours are these exploits, you with the mace in hand—that nine and  ninety fortifications at once
along with the hundredth you worked to the end, in bringing them
to rest [=collapse]. You smashed Vr̥tra, and moreover Namuci you
smashed.
### 6
Win these delights of yours, Indra, for the pious Sudās, who has given an  oblation.
For you, the bull, I yoke the two bullish fallow bays. Let my sacred
formulations pursue the prize, o you of many talents.
### 7
(Being) within this enclosure of yours here, may we not be (available) to  be delivered to evil, o mighty possessor of the fallow bays.
Protect us with defenses that keep the wolf away. May we be your dear  ones, and dear to our patrons. 8. Dear indeed to you, o bounteous one, may we men rejoice in your  charge, in your protection, as your comrades.
Grind down Turvaśa, down Yādva, intending to do (a deed) worthy to  be proclaimed for Atithigva.
### 9
Even now, all at once, o bounteous one, those in your charge, the men,  the hymn-proclaimers, are proclaiming hymns,
they who by their invocations of you have distanced the niggards
through ritual service. Choose us for this same yoking [=ritual
companionship].
### 10
These praises are for you, o most manly of men. Those granting  bounties, inclined toward us—
o Indra, become kindly disposed to them at the obstacle-smashing, as a  champion who is both comrade and helper of men.
### 11
Now, o champion Indra, being praised by reason of your help, aroused  by sacred formulations, become strengthened in your own body.
Measure out prizes to us, measure out beings [=people]. – Do you
protect us always with your blessings.

20 (536) Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins (vss. 1–2) by implicitly contrasting Indra’s history, in the odd  pādas, with his current activity in the even ones. It continues with praise especially  of Indra’s martial powers (vss. 3–5). Verse 5 takes up the theme of Indra’s birth,  found in the first pāda of the hymn, but it is not entirely clear who the father and  mother are. In our opinion this is only a metaphorical reference to birth: Indra’s  vivification at the soma sacrifice, with the bull-father actually soma, referred to in  the immediately preceding pāda (4d). The identification of the mother is more dif
ficult in this interpretation: it could be a reference to the cow whose milk is mixed  with soma. A non-ritual reading of the verse is also possible, with the father and  mother the unnamed parents of Indra referred to elsewhere in the R̥gveda.
The second half of the hymn (vss. 6–10) describes the usual reciprocal relation  between worshiper and god:  anyone who gives the appropriate ritual devotion to  Indra will be appropriately rewarded (see esp. vss. 6, 8). Yet the poet is not entirely  sure Indra is doing his part, and in verse 7 he rather saucily (and even slangily) con
trasts the proper patron–client behavior among humans with Indra’s failure to come  through. The poet also treats himself somewhat mockingly: in verse 9 he compares his  praise first to a bellowing bull and then—in our view (the relevant word is a disputed  hapax)—to another animal with a wailing or screeching cry, perhaps a monkey. But  these light moments give way to the usual pleas for benefits at the end of the hymn.
908 VII.20
### 1
He was born strong for heroic activity, autonomous—doing the work  that a manly one will do.
(Even as) a youth coming to the (ritual) session of men with his help— Indra is our rescuer from transgression, even if it is great.
### 2
The smasher of Vr̥tra, Indra, swollen with strength—the hero has now  aided the singer with help.
The maker of wide space for Sudās [/the good giver], certainly
that too!—in an instant he has become the giver of goods to the  pious man.
### 3
An unassailable battler, creating tumult, combat-hardened—a  champion, conquering entirely, unconquerable even at his birth— Indra of great strength dispersed the battle arrays; then he smashed  everyone who played the rival.
### 4
You have filled even the two world-halves with your greatness, Indra,  with your powers, powerful one.
Indra of the fallow bays, holding fast to his mace, is accustomed to the  exhilarating drinks along with the stalk.
### 5
The bull begat the bull for battle; that manly one did a woman bear. He who as leader of the army stands out from the (other) superior men,  a powerful warrior, he is the daring seeker of cattle.
### 6
Never will that person be injured, nor be harmed, who seeks to win his  [=Indra’s] terrible mind.
Whoever with sacrifices will place his friendship in Indra, he will rule  over wealth as protector of truth, born in truth.
### 7
When, o Indra, a predecessor will be doing his best for his successor  and a more important man will embark on giving to a lesser one, should the immortal be the only one sitting it out far away? Bright one,  bring bright wealth here to us.
### 8
The person dear to you who will perform ritual service for you, he will  be your comrade exclusively, o possessor of the stone.
Most pleasing to you, may we be in this benevolence of yours, in your  defense, in your protection for men, (so that) you will not smite (us). 9. This praise has bellowed (like) a bull to you, and (like) a thieving [?] (monkey?) has screeched, o bounteous one.
Desire for wealth has come over your singer. You alone, powerful one,  hold power over goods for us.
### 10
So, Indra, position us for the refreshment offered by you—and also  position those bounteous ones who themselves incite (us).
Let there be goodly skill for your singer. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.

21 (537) Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins with two verses establishing the sacrificial context, the second of  which describes the pressing stones as enthusiastic participants in the ritual. The  remaining verses celebrate Indra’s deeds and powers and beg him to display these  powers for our benefit. Verses 3 and 4 treat previous deeds, verses 6–7 primarily his  incomparable power.
The most striking verse is 5, the middle verse (vs. 10 being a refrain and thus  extra-hymnic). Here various threats to the “truth” of our people are rendered help less by our resistance and Indra’s power: threats internal to the community, namely  sorcerers and flatterers, and the “stranger” (an Ārya but an enemy), people who  deviate from our ways, and phallus-worshipers (presumably non-Āryas) outside it.
The final two verses before the refrain (8–9) recognize Indra’s help in the past  and request it for the future.
### 1
It has been pressed—the divine stalk, foamy with cows [=milk]. Indra is  accustomed to it even from birth.
We take heed of you with sacrifices, you of the fallow bays. Take heed of  our praise amid the exhilarating drinks from the stalk.
### 2
They go forth to the sacrifice, they make the ritual grass tremble—(the  pressing stones) exhilarated on soma at the ceremony, possessing
headstrong speech.
The glorious ones are carried down from their handler—the bulls whose  trampling (is heard) in the distance, the companions of the superior  man [=Indra].
### 3
You, Indra, have made the waters flow, the many waters hemmed around  by the serpent, o hero.
The nourishing streams have twisted away from you like charioteers  (maneuvering). All the finely made (fortifications) tremble with fear. 4. Fearsome, with their [=pressing stones’] weapons [=soma drinks] he  toiled at all manly labors, the knowing one.
Indra, bristling with excitement, shook apart the fortifications. With  mace in hand, he smashed them apart with his greatness.
### 5
Sorcerers do not incite us, Indra, nor sycophants with their knowing  wiles, o most powerful one.
He [=Indra?] will vaunt himself over the stranger, over the race contrary  (to our ways). Let the phallus-worshipers not penetrate our truth.
### 6
Be superior through your will, Indra, on the earth. The realms do not  contain your greatness.
Since with your own vast power you smashed Vr̥tra, no rival will find the  end (of it) in battle with you.
910 VII.22
### 7
Even the gods, the ancient ones, measured their strengths (as inferior)  to your lordship, your dominion.
Indra, having conquered, distributes bounties. It is Indra whom (men)  keep calling to in the winning of victory’s prize.
### 8
For even the weakling has called upon you for help, o Indra, who have  control over much good fortune.
O you of a hundred forms of help, you have become a help to us, and  you have become the defender of a man who, like you, distributes
portions.
### 9
May we always be your comrades, Indra, increasing our homage  because of your greatness, surpassing one.
With your help in the encounter, may they combat the attack of the  stranger, the powers of the rapacious ones.
### 10
So, Indra, position us for the refreshment offered by you—and also  position those bounteous ones who themselves incite (us).
Let there be goodly skill for your singer. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.

22 (538) Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
9 verses: virāj 1–8, triṣṭubh 9
The focus of this hymn is entirely ritual: Indra is invited to drink the soma and to  listen to the hymns of the poet, Vasiṣṭha, who in the 1st person names himself in  verse 3 and calls attention to his devotion in verses 5 and 7. He acknowledges that  there are competing rituals designed for Indra (vss. 6–7) and also acknowledges  that no ritual activities and no hymns of men can quite measure up to the worth  of Indra (vss. 8–9). Indeed, in this case Vasiṣṭha’s modesty seems justified: though  the hymn is pleasingly phrased, it hardly counts as one of the pinnacles of R̥gvedic  praise poetry.
### 1
Drink soma, Indra. Let it exhilarate you—(the soma) that the stone has  pressed for you, you of the fallow bays,
(the stone) like a steed well guided by the arms of the presser.
### 2
The dear exhilarating drink that exists to be yoked by you, with which  you smash obstacles, you of the fallow bays,
let that one exhilarate you, Indra of preeminent goods.
### 3
Take heed of this speech of mine, o bounteous one, which Vasiṣṭha  chants to you as an encomium;
enjoy these sacred formulations at the (time of) joint revelry.
### 4
Hear the call of the (pressing) stone as it drinks out (the sap); take heed  of the inspired thought of the poet as he chants. Make these gestures of friendship most intimately your own here (at the  pressing).
### 5
I, a knowing (man), do not neglect the hymns for you, the surpassing  one, nor the good praise of your lordship:
always I keep pronouncing your name, self-glorious one.
### 6
Since there are many pressings for you among the sons of Manu, many  times does a man of inspired thought call on you alone.
Don’t make a long delay at a distance from us, bounteous one.
### 7
For you alone are all these pressings, o champion; for you I make  strengthening sacred formulations.
You are to be invoked by men at all times.
### 8
Never do they (quite) reach up to the greatness of you, o wondrous  strong one, (so great as) you are considered to be—
nor to your heroism, Indra, nor to your generosity—
### 9
Neither the older seers nor the new ones, the inspired poets, who have  created sacred formulations, Indra.
Let there be friendly fellowship of you for us. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.
## 23 
23 (539) Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins with Vasiṣṭha’s self-address, exhorting himself to praise Indra,  and it ends (vs. 6) with a verse summarizing the hymn, in which the plural Vasiṣṭhas  chant to Indra. The first two verses seem to establish the context as a verbal contest  between competing poets, although this context is not prominent in the rest of the  hymn. The dominating theme is simply the soma sacrifice (soma drinks, vs. 5) and  especially the accompanying verbal offerings (vss. 1–4). Praise of Indra’s great  deeds and powers is limited to a single pāda in the first verse (1c) and the second  half of verse 3. Even this latter provides a transition to the ritual: 3d seems to refer  to the Vr̥tra myth, and 4a might be taken as expressing the aftermath of the Vr̥tra slaying, namely the release of the waters. But we consider its primary reference to  be the waters used to swell the soma stalks before pressing; “swell” is regularly used  of fertile, milking cows, but here the paradox is that the waters swell as if with milk  although they are not themselves fertile.
Noteworthy is the second half of verse 2, a variant of the usual plea to the  gods to extend our lifetime for a hundred years. Here we ask that we be carried  across the various dangers to long life, though we do not know the lifetime we will  have. Otherwise, Indra receives the standard requests to distribute wealth to us  (vss. 4–6).
912 VII.24
### 1
The sacred formulations have risen up, seeking fame. Magnify Indra at  the encounter, o Vasiṣṭha.
He who stretches over all with his vast power will hearken to the words  of such as me.
### 2
The cry that is the gods’ kinsman has been offered, Indra, as the rich  spoils were put in order at the verbal contest.
Because (the length of) their own lifetime is not perceptible to people,  carry us across just these straits.
### 3
The sacred formulations have approached the one who has enjoyed (them),  (for him) to yoke the cow-seeking chariot with his two fallow bays.
This Indra thrust apart the two world-halves with his greatness, after he  smashed the unopposable obstacles.
### 4
Even the waters swell, (though) barren like barren cows. The singers  attain the truth [=a true hymn] for you.
Drive to our teams [=hymns] like the Wind, for you distribute the prizes  along with visionary thoughts.
### 5
Let these exhilarating drinks make you exhilarated, o Indra, the
tempestuous one, powerfully generous to the singer,
for alone among the gods you distribute to mortals. At this pressing, o  champion, make yourself exhilarated.
### 6
In this way, just to Indra the bull with the mace in his arm do the  Vasiṣṭhas chant with chants.
Let him, praised, establish (wealth) consisting of men and of cows for  us. – Do you protect us always with your blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
Entirely an invitation to the sacrifice, this hymn conforms to the “journey” model,  with repeated exhortations to Indra to “drive here,” declarations that the sacrifice  has been prepared, and, especially in the final verse (6), hopes for reciprocal benefits  given by a satisfied Indra.
### 1
A womb has been made for you, Indra, on the seat (of the sacrifice).  Drive forth to it along with your men, much-invoked one,
so that you will be a helper for us and for our strengthening, and you will  give goods and will reach exhilaration through the soma drinks.
### 2
Your doubly lofty mind has been captured, Indra; the soma has been  pressed, the honeyed (drinks) poured.
With the milk-streams released, the well-turned (hymn) is borne
(forth)—this inspired thought constantly invoking Indra. 3. Drive here to us from heaven, here from earth, you of the silvery drink,  to this ritual grass to drink the soma.
Let the fallow bays convey you, the powerful one, turned toward me, to  the song, to reach exhilaration.
### 4
Drive here to us, along with all your forms of help, o possessor of the  fallow bays, taking pleasure in the sacred formulation,
twisting and turning (on your route) with your stalwart (horses), you of  good lips, providing to us your bullish impetuous force.
### 5
This praise is to convey the great, strong (Indra); it has been placed like a  prize-seeking steed at the chariot-pole.
Indra, this chant reverently invokes you for goods. Set your hearing in us  (as you set) heaven upon heaven.

Just so, Indra, give to us of what is choice. May we continually procure  your great benevolence.

King Sudās, the leader in the Battle of the Ten Kings (VII.18), appears here in verse  3, and the context is once again that of war and hostility. In sometimes vivid lan guage we beg Indra to support our side in the conflict and to destroy our enemies.

(Be) here with your help, o great strong Indra, when armies equal in  battle fury clash together

Put the “laud” of the one intending scorn in the distance. Bring here to  us an assemblage of goods.

(here), o you of the fallow bays. Do not neglect (us).914 VII.26
### 5
The Kutsas are those (who chant) a fortifying (hymn) to the one of the  fallow bays, begging for the god-sped might in Indra.

victorious, win spoils.

26 (542) Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This brief hymn displays several competing yet complementary types of structure.  On the one hand, the first two verses respond to each other and establish pressed  soma and hymns as the linked indispensible requisites of the sacrifice to Indra; the  doubly negative formulation of the first half of verse 1 is especially striking. The  last two verses (4–5) also respond to each other, each beginning with evā́ “in just  this way.” These two pairs of verses highlight the excluded verse 3, the middle verse,  as an omphalos, and this verse does contrast with the rest of the hymn in several  ways. It is the only place where Indra’s deeds are spoken of, and it also contains  in its second half a striking simile (the only simile describing Indra in the hymn),  in which the submission of fortresses to Indra is compared to the submission of  cowives to their common husband. Thus verse 3 is in a sense a miniature example of  proper praise-poetry, celebrating a god’s mythic exploits in artful language.
A different structural feature pairs verse 1 with the final verse 5, in opposition  to the three middle verses (2–4). In the first verse the speaker is “I”; in the last (vs.  5) it is Vasiṣṭha, who is doubtless identical with the “I” of verse 1. The middle verses  instead have plural ritual participants:  “those of equal skill” who call on Indra  (vs. 2), ritual adepts (vs. 3), and the unidentified subject of “they speak” in verse  4. These middle verses may refer to the competing invocations of rival sacrificers,  a subject that is something of a preoccupation of this set of Indra hymns (see, e.g.,  VII.22.6, 27.4, 28.1). The fear is always that they will attract Indra to their sacri fice rather than to that of the current speaker. The position of the Vasiṣṭha verses  on both sides of these verses and enclosing them seems implicitly to assert that  Vasiṣṭha’s invocation has been successful. The parallelism of the last two verses,  “just in this way [evá] they speak...” (vs. 4) and “just in this way [evá] Vasiṣṭha  hymns...,” highlights this contrast.
The pleasing contrastive balance of both types of ring structures gives substance  to the poet’s boast in verse 1 that he is composing a “newer hymn that [Indra] will  enjoy.” 1. Soma, unpressed, does not exhilarate Indra, nor do pressings
unaccompanied by sacred formulations (exhilarate) the
bounteous one.
For him I beget a hymn that he will enjoy, a newer manly one, so that he  will listen to us.
### 2
Wherever there is a hymn, soma exhilarates Indra; whenever there is  (ritual) conduct, the pressings (exhilarate) the bounteous one,
when, like sons to their father, those of equal skill [=poets/sacrificers]  call urgently upon him for help.
### 3
He did those (deeds)—he will now do others—which the ritual adepts  proclaim at the pressings.
As a single common husband does his wives, Indra has dragged down all  the strongholds to submission.
### 4
Just in this way they speak of him. And Indra becomes famed as the  single, surpassing apportioner of bounties,
whose many forms of help compete for the lead. His dear auspicious  things will be companions to us.
### 5
Just in this way at the pressing Vasiṣṭha hymns Indra, the bull of the  communities, to help men.
Mete out prizes to us in thousands. – Do you protect us always with your  blessings.

27 (543) Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is much preoccupied with receiving material goods from Indra. The  words “bounty,” “bounteous,” “largesse,” and so forth are prominent. What would  prompt his giving, namely our praise and sacrifice, is barely, but significantly, men tioned: the first verse opens with the martial context that is common throughout  these Indra hymns in the VIIth Maṇḍala, with men in battle position. In our inter pretation of pāda b, Indra is expected to harness the praise hymns directed to him  by the poets of our side “to be decisive”—that is, the hymns will ensure that Indra  will fight on our side and bring us victory. This concern to have Indra on our side in  battle is echoed in verse 4 with the “coincident call.” This call can refer both to war riors on opposing sides each calling Indra to fight on their own side, as in verse 1,  and also to rival sacrificers each calling Indra to come to their sacrifice, as we have  seen elsewhere in this Indra cycle.
Another important theme in the hymn is confinement, with subtle allusion to the  Vala myth. We ask for a share of the cattle enclosure in 1d and in 2d exhort Indra  to break apart the firmly closed fortresses and uncover what is enclosed there; the
916 VII.28
swelling gift-cow in 4cd was previously enclosed (in our opinion; this adjective is  ordinarily ascribed to a different root, and it can be a pun, with the second meaning  “sought after”); and in the final verse (5) we ask Indra to make wide space for our  wealth.
### 1
Indra do men call upon when facing the other side, so that he will hitch  up these insights (of theirs) (to be) decisive.
As champion at the winning of men, taking pleasure in your strength,  give us a share in the enclosure containing cattle.
### 2
The unbridled power that is yours, bounteous Indra, (with it) do your  best for your comrades, your men, o much invoked one.
Because as one who can tell things apart you (take) apart the fastnesses,  o bounteous one, (now) uncover largesse like something confined.
### 3
Indra is king of the moving world, of the settled domains, (and of)  whatever of diverse form exists on the earth.
From this he gives goods to the pious man; he impels largesse nearby,  just when he is praised.
### 4
Never does bounteous Indra, because of (another) call coincident with  ours, hold back from giving spoils along with help to us,
he whose unfailing gift-cow swells, a thing of value for his men, his
comrades, she who was (previously) enclosed.
### 5
Now, Indra, make wide space for our wealth. May we turn your mind  here for bounty,
as we pursue (wealth) in cows, horses, and chariots. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.
## 28 
28 (544) Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Another hymn in this series concerned with competition between sacrificers. The  first verse exhorts Indra to heed only our call, though others are calling, too, and in  the second verse the phrase “penetrate through” seems to refer to Indra’s ability to  ignore the competitive calls in order to come to ours. The second half of verse 2 and  verse 3 then turn to Indra’s great deeds, but this section is connected to the first by a  word play. Although it cannot be rendered easily in English, both the “vie in invok
ing” of verse 1 and the “penetrate through” in verse 2 contain the preverb ví “apart,  through,” which is in regular opposition to sám “together.” In verse 3 it is said that  Indra “united” the two world-halves, using a verb phrase including the preverb  sám (literally “lead together”). But the cosmogonic deed that is regularly credited  to Indra is rather the separation or pushing apart of the same two world-halves  (for a nearby example see VII.23.3); we contend that here this underlying formula is evoked by its opposite—the audience, familiar with the verbal formulae encap sulating Indra’s great deeds, would understand “lead together [sám]” as “lead apart [ví],” primed by the ví forms found earlier in the hymn. For another example of an  underlying formula appearing on the surface as its opposite, see Jamison (1982/83).
Verse 4 is notable because of the intrusion of Varuṇa into this Indra hymn,  and Varuṇa in his role as observer and judge of the moral behavior of humans.  Varuṇa is the tutelary deity of Vasiṣṭha (see the remarkable series of Varuṇa hymns,  VII.86–89 below), but Varuṇa’s presence is otherwise not found, or expected, in  Indraic context. Since the last verse (5) is a refrain verse, in this Indra hymn Varuṇa  has the last word, as it were. For Mitra and Varuṇa’s parentage of Vasiṣṭha, see  VII.33.10–14.
### 1
Drive up to our sacred formulations, Indra, as knowing one. Let your  yoked fallow bays be turned our way,
for although all mortals vie in invoking you, listen only to us, o
all-impeller.
### 2
Your greatness, Indra, has penetrated through to our call, in that you  protect the sacred formulations of the seers, o powerful one,
when, o strong one, you have taken the mace in your hand. Being terrible  by virtue of your will, you were born invincible—
### 3
When with your guidance you “united” the two world-halves, which were  like men eagerly calling upon (you).
Because he was born for great dominion, for power, the thruster pierced  just the non-thruster.
### 4
Through these days, Indra, show favor to us, for the settled peoples who  possess bad alliances are purifying themselves.
When the sinless one [=Varuṇa] observes untruth, once again Varuṇa,  master of artifice, (will) unloose us (from it).
### 5
We would proclaim him, just him: Indra the bounteous, so that he will  give to us of the largesse of great wealth,
he who best aids the preparation of the chanter’s sacred formulation.  – Do you protect us always with your blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Although in many ways this is a straightforward invitation to soma, the hymn is  also shot through with the anxiety about whether Indra will choose our sacrifice  that is characteristic of other hymns in this Indra cycle. The first two verses are  simple collections of the clichés of the journey/invitation hymn genre, but in verse 3
918 VII.30
the poet worries about the best means of ritual service and in verse 4 reminds Indra  that earlier poets were no different from us.
### 1
This soma here is pressed for you, Indra. Drive here toward (it), you of  the fallow bays, since you are at home with it.
Drink of this pleasing well-pressed (soma). You will give bounties,

Formulator, hero, taking pleasure in the preparation of the sacred  formulation, drive swiftly close by here with your fallow bays.
At just this pressing here reach exhilaration. You will listen to these

I will stretch out all my thoughts, seeking you. So now will you listen to  these invocations of mine?

They too were just men—those earlier seers you listened to.
So now it is I who eagerly invoke you, bounteous one. You, Indra, are  solicitude for us, like a father.

Again this hymn expresses a martial and competitive spirit, especially in verse  2. Also, as in VII.28, another god is introduced into an Indra hymn, this time Agni  (vs. 3), rather than Varuṇa (VII.28.4). The combination of Agni and the dawns sug gests a dawn sacrifice, and the praise of patrons in verse 4 must refer to the distribu tion of the dakṣiṇā or priestly gift by patrons to priests and poets at that ceremony.
### 1
Drive here to us, o god, with your vast power, tempestuous one. As  increaser of this wealth, Indra, be there (for us)
for great manliness, o lord of men, possessing a good mace—for great  dominion, for masculine power, o champion.

The champions invoke you who are to be invoked at the verbal contest,  at (the contest) for their own persons, at the winning of the sun.
You are the martial one among all peoples. You—weaken the obstacles  for easy smashing.

So that the days will dawn forth day-bright, so that you will establish  your utmost beacon in the combats, Indra, Agni has sat down as Hotar, like a lord, calling the gods here for the one  of good portion.

31 (547) Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
12 verses: gāyatrī 1–9, virāj 10–12, arranged in trcas. ̥
This twelve-verse hymn is organized into tr̥cas, the first three (1–9) in dimeter meter,  the last in trimeter, but the hymn seems conceived as a unity. It begins with the  poet’s address to his priestly comrades (vs. 1), followed by his self-address (vs. 2a),  and the joint production of his comrades and himself is referred to in the 1st plural  in 2bc. The last tr̥ca likewise begins with an address to the priests by the poet (vs.  10). At regular intervals throughout the hymn the poet and his fellow celebrants are  compared to the Maruts, who likewise hymned Indra (vss. 2, 8, 12).
The praise of Indra and the benefits we request of him are generic, but nicely balanced.
### 1
Sing forth your exhilarating (song) to Indra of the fallow bays,
to the soma-drinker, o comrades.
### 2
(You yourself, o poet—) recite solemn speech to him of good gifts. And  thus, like the superior men [=Maruts],
we have made a heavenly (speech) for him whose generosity is real.
### 3
You, Indra, are seeking spoils for us; you are seeking cows, o you of a  hundred resolves;
you are seeking gold, o good one.
### 4
We are seeking you, o Indra; we keep bellowing out to you, o bull. Know this (cry?) of ours, o good one.
### 5
Do not make us subject to scorn to be spoken or to the hostility of the  stranger.
On you is my determination (fixed).
### 6
You are armor of broad extent and a fighter in the front, o Vr̥tra-smasher. With you as yokemate, I respond to (the challenger).
### 7
And you are great, you to whose might the two autonomous
world-halves
have yielded, o Indra.

The choir of Maruts, your fellow travelers, surrounds you,
reaching you all together throughout the days.

The (soma) drops aloft in heaven come close to you, the wondrous one; the communities jointly bow to you.
### 10
(Sacrificers,) bear forth your (offering) for the great one of great
strengthening; for the forethoughtful one put forth your good thought. (Indra,) fare forth to the many clans, as the one filling up the settled  domains.
### 11
For the great one of broad expanse, for Indra, the inspired poets begat  a (hymn) with a good twist, a sacred formulation.
His commandments the clever do not transgress.

32 (548) Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi (1–25), Śakti Vāsiṣṭha (26ab), Vasiṣṭha or Śakti Vāsiṣtha  (26cd–27)
27 verses:  brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, except dvipadā virāj 3, arranged in  pragāthas
This final hymn in the VIIth Maṇḍala Indra cycle is a loose collection of pragāthas,  the first of which has a two-pāda extension (vs. 3). Even within the verse pairs there  is little cohesion. But there is a unifying theme that runs throughout: Indra’s gener ous giving and our grateful receiving, to an extent unusual even in an Indra hymn.  Moreover, it is not only Indra’s giving that we seek: it is repeatedly emphasized that  Indra helps and gives to mortals who themselves give, that is, the patrons of the  sacrifice (see, e.g., vss. 7, 8, 10, 15).
The hymn opens (vs. 1) with the preoccupation that has been visible in many  Indra hymns in VII, the fear that rival sacrificers may attract Indra to their own  rituals, and Indra’s epithet “invoked by many” appears several times (vss. 17, 20,  26). Much of the hymn is concerned with defining the type of ritual behavior that  will cause Indra to choose one sacrifice over another.
Indra is supreme in this hymn. In its twenty-seven verses there is only one men tion of another divinity, the Maruts in verse 10.
### 1
Let not (any other) cantors at all stop you at a distance from us.
Even from afar come here to our joint revelry, or being (already) here  hearken (to us),
### 2
Because these who craft sacred formulations for you sit like flies on  honey when (the soma) is pressed. The singers, seeking goods, set their desire on Indra, like a foot on a  chariot.
### 3
Desirous of wealth I call upon the one with mace in hand, possessing  a good right (hand/horse) [/bringing good priestly gifts], like a son
upon his father.
### 4
These soma drinks here, mixed with curds, have been pressed for Indra. Drive to them with your pair of fallow bays, o you with mace in hand— for exhilaration, for drinking—(as if) to your home.
### 5
He will listen: he of listening ears is implored for goods. He will never  neglect our songs.
The one who just in a single day will give hundreds, thousands—no one  will confound him when he is about to give.
### 6
That hero cannot be repulsed—he becomes puffed up by Indra, along  with his men—
who presses and rinses deep pressings for you, o Vr̥tra-smasher.
### 7
Be a defense for the bounteous (patrons), bounteous one, when you will  herd together those who vaunt themselves.
Might we have a share in the possessions of the one slain by you. Bring  here the patrimony of the one difficult to get at.
### 8
Press soma for soma-drinking Indra who holds the mace.
Cook cooked dishes. Just cause (him) to help. It is only the generous  giver who is a joy to the one who generously gives.
### 9
You pressers of soma, do not fail; be skillful for the great one. Make  (him inclined) to thrust wealth (to us).
It is just the surpassing man who wins: he dwells peacefully, he thrives.  The gods are not for the petty.
### 10
No one has encircled the chariot of Sudās [/the good giver], nor  stopped it.
Whoever has Indra as helper, whoever has the Maruts, he will come to  a pen full of cattle.
### 11
He will come to the prize when he strives for the prize—the mortal  whose helper you will be, Indra.
Become a helper to our chariots, o champion, to our men.
### 12
His share now is outstanding like the spoils of a victor.
Indra of the fallow bays—cheats do not outwit him. He places skill in  the one who has soma.
### 13
A mantra—not stunted, well arranged, well adorned—set it among  those worthy of the sacrifice.
The many onslaughts never overcome him who through ritual work  comes to be in (the good grace) of Indra.
922 VII.32
### 14
What mortal will dare against him who has you as his
possession, Indra?
It is with trust in you, bounteous one, that on the decisive day the one  vying for the prize seeks to win the prize.
### 15
At the smashing of obstacles spur on the bounteous ones who give their  own dear goods.
O you of the fallow bays, with your guidance may we, along with our  patrons, overcome all difficulties.
### 16
Yours alone is the lowest good thing, Indra; you prosper the  middling one.
You rule over each highest one entirely. No one obstructs you when  cattle (are at stake).
### 17
You are famed as the giver of spoils to everyone, whenever there are  (battle-)drives.
Every earth-dweller here, when seeking help, desires a share in your  name, o you who are invoked by many.
### 18
If I were lord of as much as you are, Indra,
I would seek to make just my praiser (well) set up, you excavator of  goods; I would not give him over to ill-estate.
### 19
I would do my best just for the one who magnifies (the god) every day,  to (bring him) wealth here wherever it is to be found,
for there exists no other, better friendship for us than you, nor even a  father, bounteous one.
### 20
It is just the surpassing one who seeks to win the prize, as yokemate  with Plenitude.
I bend Indra, invoked by many, here to you with a song, as a carpenter  bends a felly made of good wood.
### 21
Not by a bad(ly made) praise does a mortal find goods, nor will wealth  reach the one who fails.
It’s an easy skill for you, bounteous one—giving to the likes of me on  the decisive day.
### 22
We keep bellowing to you, o champion, like unmilked cows— to you, Indra, who see (like) the sun, lord of this moving (world), lord  of the still one.
### 23
There is no other heavenly one like you, nor earthly; neither born, nor  to be born.
Seeking horses, seeking cows, vying for the prize, we call upon you,  bounteous Indra.
### 24
Bring this greater (good) here, Indra, to those who are lesser, for you, bounteous one, are from of old one with many goods, and the  one to be called upon at every raid. 25. Thrust away the foes, bounteous one; make goods easy for us to find. Become a helper for us in (the contest for) great stakes; become a

33 (549) Vasisṭha’s Sons (1–9); Vasis ̣ ṭha (10–14) ̣
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi (1–9), Vasiṣṭha’s sons (10–14)
14 verses: triṣṭubh
This famous hymn, coming at the very end of the Vasiṣṭha Indra cycle, treats the  mystical birth of Vasiṣṭha and the accomplishments of Vasiṣṭha and his descen dants, particularly the feat of attracting Indra to the side of King Sudās and ensur ing Indra’s support in the Battle of the Ten Kings, the battle treated at length  in VII.18. The Anukramaṇī identifies the poet of verses 1–9 as Vasiṣṭha and the  “deity” as Vasiṣṭha’s sons, with the opposite identifications for verses 10–14, but this  does not seem the most perspicuous assignment of roles. Rather, it seems that the  hymn falls into three parts: 1–6, 7–9, 10–14, starting with a time close to the (semi mythical) present and moving backward to the deep mythical past.
The first six verses celebrate the Vasiṣṭhas’ successful invitation of Indra to their  soma sacrifice and Indra’s subsequent aid to Sudās and the Tr̥tsus in the Ten Kings  battle. Indra himself appears to be the speaker in verses 1 and 4. The first two verses  depict one of the themes running through this set of Indra hymns: competing sacri
fices. Here, Indra seems actually to rise from his seat at another sacrifice to go to the  Vasiṣṭhas in verse 1, with his journey described in verse 2. Verses 3–6 treat his aid to  Sudās in the Ten Kings battle, with all credit given to the Vasiṣṭhas’ poetic skill for  bringing this aid (vss. 3–5), and Indra himself declaring this in verse 4.
The next section begins with a trio of riddles based on the number three (vs.  7), with the last pāda of that verse asserting that it is exactly this knowledge that  the Vasiṣṭhas control—a nice meta-comment on what Vedic poets were supposed  to know. There is no consensus (modern or ancient) on the answers to these three  riddles. The three producers of semen may be the three soma-pressings, or heaven  (with its rain), soma, and man—and other answers have also been suggested. The  three Ārya “creatures” with light in front could be the three ritual fires, or the fire,  the sun, and dawn—and, again, there are other possible solutions. As for the three  “heats,” these could again be the ritual fires, or the sun, the fire, and the gharma924 VII.33
drink, or some other triad. It is perhaps pleasing that the Vasiṣṭhas’ esoteric knowl edge has remained safe with them for over three millennia! This skill of theirs at  decoding secrets and putting them in proper verbal form is celebrated further in  verse 8 and the first half of verse 9.
The second half of verse 9 provides the transition to the last section, concern ing the birth of Vasiṣṭha. What the Vasiṣṭhas are weaving (a motif recurring almost  verbatim in vs. 12) is not entirely clear, but we are inclined to think it concerns the  institution and performance of the sacrifice. It is clear why they are approaching the  Apsarases (the heavenly “nymphs” of Vedic and later Indian culture): one of the  Apsarases’ number, Urvaśī, is their mother (see vss. 11–12), with Mitra and Varuṇa  as their father (see vss. 11, 13), in the first of their forefather Vasiṣṭha’s births. Both  births are referred to in verse 10, both that from Mitra and Varuṇa and that when  Agastya presented him to the clan. To say that the details of the births are murky  is an understatement, and we will not attempt here to interpret all the mysteries in  these verses. The last verse (14) is traditionally taken as Agastya’s words, introduc
ing Vasiṣṭha to his adoptive clan, the Tr̥tsus, and outlining Vasiṣṭha’s ritual role.  The address to “you thrusters forth” (pratr̥daḥ) is most likely a pun on their name.
### 1
[Indra:] They, bright-faced, with their braids on the right side, quickening  thought—because they exhilarated me,
I, standing up from the ritual grass, speak about the superior
men: “They cannot be helped by me from a distance—the Vasiṣṭhas.” 2. From a distance they led Indra here with pressed (soma)—across a lake’s  worth (of soma), on beyond the powerful drink.
Over the pressed soma of Pāśadyumna Vāyata he preferred the Vasiṣṭhas. 3. It was certainly just with them that he crossed the Sindhu; certainly just  with them that he smashed Bheda [/the “Splitter”];
it was certainly just by reason of your sacred formulation that Indra  helped Sudās in the Battle of the Ten Kings, o Vasiṣṭhas.
### 4
[Indra:] Gladly, you superior men, by reason of your fathers’ sacred  formulation, I have engirded the axle: you will certainly not be
harmed,
since with a lofty cry in Śakvarī [=martial] (meter) you established
impetuous force in Indra, o Vasiṣṭhas.
### 5
Like thirsty ones looking toward heaven (for rain), in distress they  looked toward (Indra) when they were surrounded in the Battle of the  Ten Kings.
Indra hearkened to Vasiṣṭha as he was praising; he made the broad space  broad for the Tr̥tsus.
### 6
They were cut off short, like goads for driving cattle—the puny Bharatas. When Vasiṣṭha came to be the leader, right after that did the clans of the  Tr̥tsus spread out. 7. Three produce semen in the world; three creatures belonging to the  Ārya have light in front.
Three heats accompany the dawn. All these (triads) do they know
through and through—the Vasiṣṭhas.
### 8
Their light is like the waxing of the sun; their greatness is deep as  the sea’s;
like the speed of the wind, your praise hymn, o Vasiṣṭhas, can be
pursued by no other.
### 9
Only they converge upon the thousand-twigged secret with the insights  of their heart.
Weaving the covering (garment) stretched by Yama, they reverently  approached the Apsarases—the Vasiṣṭhas.
### 10
When Mitra and Varuṇa saw you as light compacting itself from out of  the lightning—
that was (one) birth of yours, Vasiṣṭha, and (there was) one when
Agastya brought you here for the clan.
### 11
And you are the descendant of Mitra and Varuṇa, o Vasiṣṭha, born  from Urvaśī, from her mind, you formulator.
A drop (of semen?) spurted forth: with a heavenly formulation all the  gods took you in a lotus.
### 12
He, foreknowing of both in his insight, possessing a thousand gifts and  one gift (more),
intending to weave the covering stretched by Yama, was born from the  Apsaras—Vasiṣṭha.
### 13
The two [=Mitra and Varuṇa?], brought into being at a (ritual) Session,  aroused by reverences, poured their common semen into a pot.
From it arose Māna from the middle. From it they say the seer was
born—Vasiṣṭha.
### 14
[Agastya?:] He supports the supporter of solemn speech [=Hotar], the  supporter of the melody [=Udgātar]; supporting the pressing stone
he will speak forth at the beginning.
Do you reverently approach him, seeking benevolence. He will come to  you, you thrusters forth—Vasiṣṭha.

34 (550) All Gods (except Ahi 16, Ahi Budhnya 17a)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
25 verses: dvipadā 1–21, triṣṭubh 22–25
This loosely structured hymn intersperses verses relating to the sacrifice, especially  its poetic portion (e.g., vss. 1, 4–5, 8–9), with verses dedicated to particular gods.
926 VII.34
In the early parts of the hymn, the verses to gods are structured as riddles, and the  god is not named: Indra in verse 3, Savitar in verse 4, Agni (?) in verse 7. But in later  parts of the hymn the gods and divine forces are identified, starting with Varuṇa  in verses 10–11. Minor gods predominate in this section (e.g., Ahi Budhnya, the  Serpent of the Deep, vss. 16–17), through verse 23. There are also several interludes  requesting help against hostility and bodily harm (vss. 12–13, 18–19). The final  two verses call on many of the major gods of the pantheon, without distinguishing  characteristics.
There is a distinct watery theme running throughout the hymn, beginning with  the waters themselves (vss. 2–3). When Varuṇa is mentioned (vss. 10–11), it is in his  association with waters, a mostly later quality of Varuṇa’s. The Child of the Waters  (Apām Napāt, vs. 15) and the “water-born” Serpent of the Deep (vss. 16–17) con
tribute to this aqueous environment, and the waters themselves reappear in verse  23. The reason for this emphasis on water is not clear.

### 4
Put the horses to the chariot-poles for him.
Golden-armed, he carries the mace like Indra.
### 5
Set out on the sacrifice as if through the days.
Like a (chariot-)driver in flight, spur it on by yourself.
### 6
By yourself spur on the sacrifice at the combats.
Establish it as a beacon, a hero for the people.
### 7
From its tempestuous force it has arisen like a radiant beam.
It bears its burden, like the earth its ground.
### 8
I invoke the gods without sorcery, o Agni.
Assuring its success through truth, I produce my insight.
### 9
Harness your divine insight.
Put your speech forward among the gods.
### 10
He inspects the haven of these (waters), of the rivers—
powerful Varuṇa of a thousand eyes.
### 11
King of kingdoms, ornament of the rivers:
lifelong lordship has been conceded to him.
### 12
Aid us amid all the clans;
render harmless the “laud” of him who wishes to scorn.
### 13
Let the unfriendly missile of the haters go wide.
Keep the infirmity of bodies away, off to the side.
### 14
Agni, the oblation-eater, has aided us with our acts of reverence. The dearest praise has been produced for him. 15. Along with the gods, make the Child of the Waters your companion. Let him be friendly to us.
### 16
I will sing to the water-born serpent with hymns:
he is sitting in the depth of the rivers, in the dusky realms.
### 17
Let Ahi Budhnya [/the Serpent of the Deep] not set us up for harm; let the sacrifice of him who seeks the truth not fail.
### 18
And they have placed fame upon these men of ours.
Let them [=men] go forth for wealth, vaunting themselves over the
stranger.
### 19
They scorch the rival, like the sun the worlds—
those possessing great weapons with their onslaughts.
### 20
When the Wives (of the Gods) will come to us,
let Tvaṣṭar of the lovely hands confer heroes (on us).
### 21
Might Tvaṣṭar enjoy our praise.
Might Aramati [/Devotion], seeking goods, be in us.
### 22
The Gift-Escorts will give goods to us. Let Rodasī, let Varuṇāṇī pay heed.
Let him be one affording good shelter (along?) with the Shielding
Goddesses; let generously giving Tvaṣṭar apportion wealth.
### 23
Then let the mountains (apportion) us wealth, then let the waters, then  the Gift-Escorts, the plants, and Heaven,
and Earth jointly with the trees. The two world-halves will protect us all  around.
### 24
Then let the two broad world-halves follow suit, let heaven-ruling  Varuṇa, whose comrade is Indra, follow;
let all the Maruts, who are victorious, follow. Might we be (fit) to found  the buttress of wealth.
### 25
Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, the waters, the plants, the trees shall enjoy  this of ours.
Might we be in the shelter, in the lap of the Maruts. – Do you protect  us always with your blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
15 verses: triṣṭubh
This fifteen-verse hymn is in competition for the most boring hymn in the R̥gveda  (a competition in which there are remarkably few entries). In the first thirteen  verses every pāda begins with the indeclinable word śám “luck, weal” in the  hardly varying formula “luck for us be X,” with X a god or gods, power, or  sacrificial element. There is generally a rationale for the groupings found in each
928 VII.35
verse, though it not always transparent (see, e.g., vs. 3). The final two verses  (14–15) inclusively beg all the gods in various groupings to enjoy the praise and  grant space to us.
### 1
Luck for us be Indra and Agni with their help; luck for us Indra and  Varuṇa, on whom oblations are bestowed.
Luck Indra and Soma—luck and lifetime for good faring; luck for us  Indra and Pūṣan at the winning of prizes.
### 2
Luck for us Fortune, and luck for us be Laud. Luck for us Plenitude  and luck be Riches.
Luck for us the Laud of what is real and easy to guide; luck for us be  Aryaman, born many times.
### 3
Luck for us the Establisher and luck be the Upholder for us. Luck for  us be the Wide-Spreading (Earth?) with her own powers.
Luck be the lofty World-Halves, luck for us the Stone; luck let the
easily called (names) of the gods be for us.
### 4
Luck for us be Agni, whose face is light; luck for us Mitra and Varuṇa,  the Aśvins luck.
Luck for us be the good deeds of the good doers; luck let the vigorous  Wind blow to us.
### 5
Luck for us Heaven and Earth at the Early Invocation; luck be the  Midspace for us to see.
Luck for us be the plants, the trees; luck be the victorious lord of the  dusky realm.
### 6
Luck for us be god Indra along with the Vasus; luck Varuṇa of good  laud along with the Ādityas;
luck for us healing Rudra along with the Rudras [=Maruts]; for luck let  Tvaṣṭar along with the Wives hear us here.
### 7
Luck for us be Soma; the Sacred Formulation luck for us; luck for us be  the Pressing Stones and luck the Sacrifices.
Luck for us be the Fixing of the Posts; luck for us be the Fruitful
(plants) and the Altar.
### 8
For luck for us let the Sun of broad gaze go up; luck for us be the four  Directions.
Luck for us be the steadfast Mountains. Luck for us the Rivers and
luck be the Waters.
### 9
Luck for us be Aditi with her commandments; luck for us be the  Maruts of good chant.
Luck for us Viṣṇu and luck be Pūṣan; luck for us (the means of)
Creation and luck be the Wind.
### 10
Luck for us god Savitar who gives protection; luck for us be the widely  radiant Dawns.
Luck be Parjanya for us and for our offspring; luck for us be the Lord  of the Dwelling Place, who is Luck itself. 11. Luck for us be the Gods, the All Gods; luck be Sarasvatī along with her  insights.
Luck the Escorts and luck the Gift-Escorts; luck for us the Heavenly  ones, the Earthly ones, luck for us the Watery ones.
### 12
Luck for us be the masters of the real; luck for us the steeds, and luck  be the cows.
Luck for us the R̥bhus of good action and good hands; luck for us be  the Fathers at the invocations.
### 13
Luck for us be god Aja Ekapad; luck for us Ahi Budhnya [/Serpent of  the Deep], luck the Sea.
Luck for us be the swelling Child of the Waters; luck for us be Pr̥śni,  who has the gods as her protectors.
### 14
The Ādityas, the Rudras, the Vasus enjoy this sacred formulation being  made here anew.
Let them hear us—the Heavenly ones, the Earthly ones, the Cow-Born  ones, and those who are worthy of the sacrifice.
### 15
Those who are the sacrificial ones of the sacrificial gods, the occasion  of sacrifice for Manu, immortal, knowing the truth,
let them grant us wide-ranging space today. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.
## 36 
36 (552) All Gods
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
9 verses: triṣṭubh
Like many All God hymns, this one allots a verse each to a god or group of gods,  most named, some not named but obvious from their description, and a few  less transparently characterized. The verses whose divinities are clear are 1: Sun;  2: Mitra and Varuṇa; 5: Rudra, 6: Rivers, 7: Maruts (and their mother Pr̥śni?);  8:  Aramati, Pūṣan, and Bhaga; 9:  Maruts and Viṣṇu. For verse 3 some schol
ars identify the Wind and Parjanya [Thunder] as the dedicands, but we assign  it instead to Soma; verse 4 may belong to both Indra and Aryaman, but we  consider aryamán here to be used as a descriptor of Indra, rather than as the  name of the third member of the Ādityan triad, since the other descriptors—
strong resolution and confounding of the enemy’s battle fury—are characteristic  of Indra.
The hymn can also be read as a chronological progress through a sacrifice. In  verse 1 the fire is kindled at dawn and ritual speech is uttered on the ritual ground.  The hymn is mentioned in verse 2, and the preparation of soma in verse 3. The  invitation to Indra to come to the sacrifice with his horses is given in verse 4, and  the actual sacrifice occurs in verse 5. Although the verse to the rivers (6) does not  appear to fit this pattern, it could refer to the waters used to swell the soma stalks
930 VII.36
(see also vs. 3) or to other ritual uses of water. The final three verses (7–9) call upon  the various gods for wealth and progeny.
### 1
Let the sacred formulation go forth from the seat of truth. The Sun with  his rays has dispatched the cows outward.
The broad Earth has stretched out on her back. Agni has been kindled  on her wide face.
### 2
This well-twisted (hymn) here do I make anew, like a refreshing drink, for  you two, lordly Mitra and Varuṇa.
One of you two, the strong one, is an undeceivable tracer of the track,  and (the other), Mitra, arranges the people in their place when
called upon.
### 3
The movements of the swooping wind come to rest. The sweet (stalks?)  have swelled like milk-cows.
Being born in the seat of great heaven, the bull has roared in the
self-same udder.
### 4
Whoever will yoke with a hymn these two fallow bays of yours, o  champion Indra, the two dear ones, good at the chariot, seeking
fodder,
I (as that person) would turn hither the very resolute god of custom  [/Aryaman, here = Indra] who confounds the battle fury of the one
who wishes to do harm.
### 5
The reverent ones worship his fellowship and vitality on the domain of  truth itself.
He has thrust outward the fortifying nourishments when being praised  by men. This reverence is dearest to Rudra.
### 6
When the glorious ones are bellowing simultaneously—(the other rivers  and) Sarasvatī, whose mother is the Sindhu, as seventh—
who are richly fertile, rich in milk, rich in streams, they (come) toward  (us), swelling with their own milk.
### 7
And these Maruts, exulting—let the prizewinners aid our insight and  progeny.
Let not the imperishable (cow? [=Pr̥śni?]) overlook us as she roams. They  have increased wealth to be harnessed for us.
### 8
Set in front of yourselves great Devotion [/Aramati], in front Pūṣan, like  a hero deserving of the ceremonial distribution;
and Bhaga, who aids this insight of ours, and the prize at its winning,  and Plenitude the Gift-Escort.
### 9
Let this signal-call of ours go to you, o Maruts, to Viṣṇu, who protects  the poured out (semen) with his help.
And let them establish vitality for the singer to produce progeny. – Do  you protect us always with your blessings. 

## 37
37 (553) All Gods
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Although this hymn is technically dedicated to the All Gods, it is only the R̥bhus  and Indra who feature in the hymn proper (R̥bhus esp. vss. 1–2, Indra vss. 3–7), with  Savitar addressed in the final verse (8). The association of Indra with the R̥bhus  identifies the ritual moment as the Third Pressing, which they share, and since  Savitar is often associated with the evening, his presence is also appropriate.
The first four verses concern the sacrifice: the gods come, drink together, and  give gifts to the sacrificer and his patrons. In verse 4 Indra is sent home with a final  chorus. The next verses change the scene. In verses 5–6 Indra is praised for his help  in winning more territory for us, but he seems to be withholding the wealth we  expect. The most puzzling verse is 7, which has elicited various interpretations. In  our opinion, the “triple kin-bonds” refers to the three-generation model, in which a  man is situated conceptually between his father and his sons; this man is threatened  by dissolution and premature death, not only of himself but also of his sons, and he  approaches Indra for aid, since Indra himself successfully attains old age (an inter esting conceit for a “deathless” or “immortal” god). But this interpretation remains  uncertain and speculative. The first pāda of the final verse (8) forms a ring with the  first pāda of the hymn, and the topic returns to the gifts we expect and hope for.
### 1
Let the chariot, the best conveyor, convey you here to be praised, o Vājas,  R̥bhukṣans—(a chariot) indestructible.
Fill yourselves to exhilaration with great triple-backed soma drinks at  the pressings, you lovely-lipped ones.
### 2
You confer a treasure on the bounteous (patrons), you R̥bhukṣans of  sunlike sight—(a treasure) indestructible.
Drink together at the sacrifices, autonomous ones. Apportion rewards to  us in accordance with our thoughts.
### 3
Because you, bounteous one, are accustomed to giving at the distribution  of goods great and small,
both your fists are filled with goods. No (one) will hold back your
liberalities, your masses of goods.
### 4
You, Indra, are the self-glorious R̥bhukṣan. Like a prize reaching its  goal, you go home accompanied by verses.
May we Vasiṣṭhas now be your pious servers, you of the fallow bays, as  we prepare the sacred formulation.
### 5
You regularly gain the (river-)courses just for your pious server, along  which you will accomplish your work in accord with your visions, you  of the fallow bays.
We have now won by your help allied (to us). When, Indra, would you  show the favor of your wealth to us?
932 VII.38
### 6
You seem to be causing us, your ritual adepts, to bide our time. When  will you take notice of our speech, Indra?
In accord with a papa’s vision the fortifying prizewinning steed should  carry home to us wealth rich in heroes.
### 7
Even (a man) toward whom the goddess Disorder extends her
dominion—(because) the autumns rich in fortifying nourishment
reach Indra,
that man of triple kin-bonds draws near to him [=Indra, who is] one who  reaches old age—(even a man) whom (other) mortals would render
bereft of his own clansmen.
### 8
Let rewards come here to us to be praised, o Savitar; let the riches of the  mountain come here at (the time for) giving.
Always let the heavenly protector accompany us. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.
## 38 
38 (554) Savitar, except Savitar or Bhaga (6cd), Prizewinning  Horses (7–8)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
8 verses: triṣṭubh
Although the Anukramaṇī assigns most of this hymn to Savitar, with possibly a  half-verse to Bhaga and the final two verses to the Vājins (prizewinning horses), it  seems more likely to have been an All God hymn in original conception. It is found  in the middle of the All God hymns of the VIIth Maṇḍala in proper sequence as  to meter and number of verses, and, in addition to Savitar, mentions a number  of divinities, including several minor ones found also in the surrounding All God  hymns: see especially verse 5 with the Gift-Escorts (also VII.34.22, 23; 35.11; 40.6),  Ahi Budhnya (the Serpent of the Deep; also VII.34.17; 35.13), and the Shielding  Goddess(es); also VII.34.22; 40.6). The mysterious Ekadhenus (literally, “having  a single milk-cow”) are found only here. It is not unusual in an All God hymn for  a single god to predominate and others to be mentioned only in passing; compare  nearby VII.37 with its primary focus on Indra and the R̥bhus.
Savitar’s role is most prominent in the first two verses, where, as usual, he stands  up and raises his emblem, demonstrating his power to impel and compel. The group  of gods known as Vasus praises him in verse 3; Aditi and the Ādityas greet him in  verse 4; and, as already mentioned, several minor divinities are found in verse 5. As  often, the god Bhaga (“Fortune”) is invoked along with Savitar (vss. 1 and 6) as the  distributor of goods, which we seek. The last two verses (7–8) concern the “prize
winners” (vājín). This word is frequently a descriptor of horses in competition, and  a number of scholars consider the reference here to be actual horses in the human  realm. However, the sacrificial context in these two verses is strong, and on the basis of phraseological parallels we consider the referents to be the Maruts (who are  called prizewinners in VII.36.7, while the phrase “let the Maruts of good chant be  luck for us” is found in VII.35.9).
### 1
This god Savitar holds up the golden emblem which he has fixed firm. Now is Bhaga to be invoked by the sons of Manu—he of many goods  who distributes treasures.
### 2
Stand up, Savitar. Listen, o golden-palmed one, at the (ritual)
presentation of this truth,
unloosing your emblem wide and broad, impelling mortals’ sustenance  here for men.
### 3
Let god Savitar, when praised, be nearby, whom also all the Vasus hymn. Let him, worthy of reverence, take delight in our praises. Let him protect  the patrons with all his protectors.
### 4
Whom goddess Aditi greets, taking pleasure in the impulsion of god  Savitar,
(him) do the sovereign kings Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman and their allies  greet in concert—
### 5
(As do) those who, zealous in rivalry, serve the gift of Heaven and Earth  as Gift-Escorts.
And let Ahi Budhnya hear us; let the Shielding Goddess defend (us) with  the Ekadhenus.
### 6
Might the Lord of the Family [=Bhaga] concede this treasure of god  Savitar’s to us, when he is begged for it.
Bhaga does the powerful one keep calling for help, and Bhaga does the  powerless one beg for a treasure.
### 7
Let these prizewinners [=Maruts]—those of measured pace and lovely  chants—be luck for us at the invocations in the divine assembly.
Crushing the serpent, the wolf, the demonic powers, they will keep
afflictions away from us, bag and baggage.
### 8
Help us to every prize, o prizewinners, when the stakes (are set), you  truth-knowing, immortal inspired poets.
Drink of this honey here; make yourselves exhilarated. Satisfied, drive  along the paths that lead to the gods.
## 39 
39 (555) All Gods
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The organizing principle of this hymn is the ritual fire (Agni) and the dawn sacri fice over which he presides. In verse 1 the sacrifice is set in motion; the gods begin934 VII.39
to assemble at dawn at the sacrificial ground (vss. 2–3), and Agni is exhorted to  perform the sacrifice (vs. 4) and to bring the various gods to it (vs. 5). The poet  declares his own contribution to the sacrifice and asks Agni for the appropriate  rewards (vs. 6). The final verse (7) summarizes what has gone before, in the name  of the Vasiṣṭhas.
Verse 2b contains an impossible hapax, bī́riṭe, phonologically aberrant and mor phologically opaque. It is generally taken as “crowd, troop,” following Yāska, but,  as there is no particular etymological or contextual support for this, we have simply  declined to translate it.
### 1
Agni, erect, has just propped up the favor of the good one. The firebrand  goes, facing toward the divine assemblage.
The two (pressing-)stones take to the path like charioteers. The Hotar,  when prompted, will offer a true (hymn) as sacrifice.
### 2
The one receiving very pleasurable offerings [=Agni] has twisted the  ritual grass for them [=gods]. Like two clanlords at [/in] bī́riṭa [?], they  hasten here,
(the clanlords) of clans, at (the coming) of dawn from night, at the Early  Invocation—Pūṣan and Vāyu with his team, for well-being.
### 3
Here on the earth the good ones, the gods have come to rest. The  resplendent ones groom themselves in the wide midspace.
You all who extend widely, make your paths inclined hither. Harken to  this messenger of ours [=Agni] who has gone (to you).
### 4
Because these helpers, worthy to receive sacrifice at the sacrifices, the  gods, all surmount the seat,
sacrifice to them, who desire it, at the ceremony, o Agni, with
obedience—to Bhaga, the Nāsatyas, Plenitude.
### 5
O Agni, bring Mitra, Varuṇa, and Indra here from heaven and from  earth to the hymns and to the fire—
also Aryaman, Aditi, Viṣṇu the quick. Let Sarasvatī and the Maruts  make themselves exhilarated.
### 6
I have bestowed an oblation along with poetic thoughts on those worthy  of the sacrifice. The insatiable one [=Agni] will attain the desire of
mortals.
Confer inexhaustible ever-winning wealth. Might we be accompanied by  the gods, who will now be our yokemates.
### 7
Now have the two World-Halves been praised by the Vasiṣṭhas, and the  truthful ones, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Agni.
Let the glittering ones hold out to us the utmost chant. – Do you protect  us always with your blessings.

The preoccupation of this hymn is the distribution of wealth, to be carried out in  orderly and fair fashion by a series of gods, starting in verse 1 with Savitar and  Bhaga (Fortune), whose involvement in the apportioning of treasures we met in  the nearby hymn VII.38. But a wide variety of gods are implicated in this giving,  as well as in providing other help (see vss. 3–4). There is little to attract particular  attention in this hymn, save for the sly admonition to Pūṣan not to be jealous of our  receiving gifts (vs. 6).
### 1
Let attentive hearing come together with (speech?) appropriate to  the rite of distribution. Might we (properly) aim our praise of the
surpassing ones.
When today god Savitar will give the impetus, may we be at the
apportioning of him who possesses treasures [=Bhaga].
### 2
Let Mitra, Varuṇa, and the two World-Halves, let Indra and Aryaman  give us what is apportioned by heaven.
Let goddess Aditi designate the legacy that both Vāyu and Bhaga will  harness.
### 3
Let him be powerful, Maruts, let him be headstrong—just that mortal  whom you will help, you of the dappled horses.
And Agni and Sarasvatī spur him on. There exists no one who can
encompass his wealth.
### 4
Because this leader of truth, Varuṇa, as well as Mitra and Aryaman, (all)  kings, have accomplished their work—
and goddess Aditi, easy to invoke and without assault—they will bring  us unharmed across difficult straits.
### 5
There is propitiation for this god who grants rewards [=Rudra], at the  ritual offering to quick Viṣṇu, with oblations,
for Rudra knows his own Rudrian might. Aśvins, drive your circuit of  refreshment.
### 6
Don’t get envious now, glowing Pūṣan, when the Shielding Goddess and  the Gift-Escorts will make bestowal.
Let the steeds who are joy itself protect us. Let Wind in his circling
give rain.
### 7
Now have the two World-Halves been praised by the Vasiṣṭhas, and the  truthful ones, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Agni.
Let the glittering ones hold out to us the utmost chant. – Do you protect  us always with your blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1
Like the last hymn, this one is completely devoted to our acquisition of wealth by  distribution, but here the distribution is ascribed almost entirely to Bhaga, the god  of Fortune, whose name also means “portion.” The hymn begins (vs. 1) with a gen eral invocation of a range of gods in early morning, including Bhaga, but the next  five verses (2–5) call insistently on Bhaga, punning several times on his name. The  early-morning context of the hymn returns with the last two verses (6–7), concern ing the Dawns, who bring Bhaga with them (vs. 6). The final verse, which does not  mention Bhaga, is found also in a Dawn hymn later in the VIIth Maṇḍala (VII.80.3)  and is clearly extra-hymnic here.
### 1
At early morning we call on Agni, at early morning on Indra, at early  morning on Mitra and Varuṇa, at early morning on the Aśvins;
at early morning on Bhaga, Pūṣan, Brahmaṇaspati, at early morning on  Soma and Rudra should we call.
### 2
We should call on the one victorious at early morning, Bhaga the strong,  Aditi’s son, who is the distributor,
to whom even a person who thinks himself weak (and also) even the  powerful, even the king says “Apportion me a portion.”
### 3
O Bhaga the leader, o Bhaga whose generosity is real, o Bhaga—promote  this poetic insight of ours as you give to us.
Bhaga, propagate us with cows and horses; Bhaga, might we, possessed  of superior men, be preeminent through our men.
### 4
And just now might we be possessed of portion [/accompanied by  Bhaga], and at evening and at the middle of the days,
and at the rising of the sun, o bounteous one, might we be in the good  grace of the gods.
### 5
Let Bhaga himself be possessed of portion, o gods. In this way might we  be possessed of portion [/accompanied by Bhaga].
Each and every one constantly calls on you, Bhaga. Become our guide  here, Bhaga.
### 6
The Dawns (will) jointly bow in reverence to the ceremony, like
Dadhikrāvan to the gleaming footprint [=sacrificial ground].
Like prizewinning horses a chariot let them convey the goods-finding  Bhaga here in our direction.
### 7
Let the Dawns, accompanied by horses, by cows, by heroes, dawn always  auspicious for us,
milking out ghee on all sides, teeming. – Do you protect us always with  your blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
Like VII.39, this hymn concerns the dawn soma sacrifice and especially Agni’s role  in it. The hymn begins with a verse expressing the readiness of all the ritual ele ments. Then Agni takes over and provides the impetus, hitching up his flames in  verse 2, and, as he gets larger, performing the sacrifice (vss. 3, 5). In verse 4 Agni  (identified as a guest, as often) is asked for the reward that is the expected return  for a successful sacrifice. The final verse (6) is a typical summary verse and names  Vasiṣṭha as the poet, as in another summary verse in this series (VII.39.7=40.7).  Although this is an All God hymn, the participation of named gods other than  Agni is limited to verse 5, where they are the simply the recipients of the sacrifice.  The mention of Aṅgirases in verse 1 is probably meant as a reference to the poet  and the other priests.
### 1
The Aṅgirases, possessors of the sacred formulation, are reaching forth.  Let the roar of (the hymn? fire? soma?) that is set to burst out go
questing forth.
The cows swimming in the waters are bellowing forth. The two
pressing-stones should be yoked, as the ornament of the ceremony.
### 2
Easy is your road, Agni, which was found long ago. Yoke your fallow  bays and chestnuts when the soma is pressed,
or those ruddy ones which, conveying heroes, are at your seat. Seated,  I call the races of gods.
### 3
They magnify the sacrifice for you all with acts of reverence; the
gladdening Hotar [=Agni] is projecting in the nearness.
Sacrifice well to the gods, o you of many faces. You should turn hither  Aramati [/Devotion] worthy of the sacrifice.
### 4
When in the dwelling of a rich hero the guest will show brightly, lying in  his comfortable womb,
Agni, well pleased, well established in the house, will give to a clan such  as this a desirable reward.
### 5
Enjoy this ceremony of ours, o Agni. Make it glorious for us among the  Maruts and Indra.
Then sit here on the ritual grass night and dawn. Sacrifice here to Mitra  and Varuṇa, who desire it.
### 6
Just in this way Vasiṣṭha, desirous of wealth (like) the distillate of all  mother’s milk, praised powerful Agni.
He will spread out refreshment, wealth, and victory’s prize for us. – Do  you protect us always with your blessings.

5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn has even less interest in individual gods than the most recent in this All  God series. Instead the sacrifice is again the focus: it is set in motion in verses 1–2,  with the priests exhorted to perform the ritual actions in the latter verse. The gods’  attendance is described in verses 3–4, and the poet’s relative indifference to their  individual identities is expressed in the phrase “however many you are” at the end  of verse 4. Appropriate to the ritual focus, Agni is the only god named (besides a  glancing reference to Heaven and Earth in vs. 1), and his actions and companion
ship are crucial to our well-being.
### 1
At the sacrifices those seeking the gods chant forth for you all to Heaven  and Earth with acts of reverence, in order to prosper—
those whose unequalled, inspired sacred formulations go questing in  divergent directions like the branches of a tree.
### 2
Let the sacrifice go forth, like a team to be spurred on. Being of one  mind, hold up the (ladles) facing toward the ghee;
spread the ritual grass that brings success to the ceremony. The flames,  seeking the gods, have stood up erect.
### 3
Like piggyback children on their mother, let the gods sit on the back of  the ritual grass.
Let (the ladle) facing in all directions anoint (the speech?) appropriate  to the rite of distribution. O Agni, do not make us negligent in our
attendance on the gods.
### 4
Those worthy of sacrifices do service to themselves according to their  pleasure, milking for themselves the good milkers, the streams
of truth.
Preeminent is the greatness of you good ones here today: come here,  being of one mind, however many you are.
### 5
In just this way, o Agni, show favor to our clans. In company with you, o  mighty one,
with wealth as our yokemate, we feasting companions are free from
harm. – Do you protect us always with your blessings.

44 (560) Dadhikrā, except Assorted Divinities (1)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1
Like VII.41, this hymn begins with a verse in jagatī calling on a number of gods,  especially those associated with the dawn ritual, and including the figure that will be the subject of most of the rest of the hymn, in this case the celebrated  racehorse Dadhikrā(van). (See IV.38–40 for other hymns devoted to Dadhikrā;  the last two [39—40] also show significant dawn associations.) Unlike VII.41,  however, where the god who is subject of the rest of the hymn, Bhaga, holds  the stage essentially alone after the first verse, Dadhikrā shares each of the  subsequent verses with a number of gods, again primarily characteristic of the  dawn ritual.
The most difficult verse is 3, not coincidentally the middle verse, whose third  pāda contains two color terms as addressees and a next-to-impossible hapax  (mām̐ścatóḥ), whose meaning is hotly disputed. Most commentators interpret  the color terms as referring to other horses. Our interpretation is quite different  and unavoidably speculative, but rather than introducing two otherwise unknown  horses, we identify the two addressees as gods associated with the ritual. In our view  the hapax refers to the two twilights (literally, “the time of the hiding of the moon,”  originally applied just to dawn), and the copper-colored one is the sun, whose color  is reddish at rising and setting, while the reddish-brown one is soma: the same color  term is used of soma a number of times.
Though it is not entirely clear why Dadhikrā is so strongly associated with the  dawn, it may be significant that the priestly gifts (dakṣiṇā) are distributed at the  dawn ritual and horses are among the most prized of these gifts. In most of this  hymn the equine aspects of Dadhikrā are not emphasized, except for vs. 4, unlike  the Dadhikrā hymns in Maṇḍala IV.
### 1
Upon Dadhikrā as the first, upon the Aśvins and Dawn, upon the  kindled Agni and Bhaga, do I call for your sake for help,
upon Indra, Viṣṇu, Pūṣan, and Brahmaṇaspati, upon the Ādityas,
Heaven and Earth, the Waters, and the Sun.
### 2
Awakening Dadhikrā with homage, rousing ourselves and reverently  approaching the sacrifice,
seating the goddess Refreshment on the ritual grass, we would call upon  the Aśvins, inspired poets easy to call.
### 3
To Dadhikrāvan and Agni do I speak on having awakened, and to Dawn,  the Sun, and the Cow,
to the one of Varuṇa who is copper-colored at the twilights [=sun?] and  to the reddish-brown one [=soma?]. Let them keep all difficulties away  from us.
### 4
Dadhikrāvan becomes the foremost prizewinning steed at the forefront  of the chariots, as the foreknowing one,
being in accord with Dawn and the Sun, with the Ādityas, Vasus, and  Aṅgirases.
### 5
Let Dadhikrā anoint our pathway, for us to follow along the path  of truth.
Let the divine troop and Agni hear us. Let all the buffaloes, who are  never fooled, hear us.

45 (561) Savitar
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
4 verses: triṣṭubh
This simple hymn concentrates on Savitar as giver of goods and human necessities,  though several of his other characteristic acts are mentioned, notably the raising  of his golden arms (vs. 2) and the daily bringing to rest and impelling forth of the  living world (vs. 1).
### 1
Let god Savitar drive here, possessed of good treasure, filling the
midspace, journeying with his horses,
holding many things meant for men in his hand, bringing the world to  rest and impelling it forth.
### 2
His two golden arms, pliant and lofty, have reached up to the ends of heaven. Now this greatness of his has been marveled at. Even the sun has ceded  to him his task.
### 3
The overpowering god Savitar will impel good things here as the lord  of goods.
Spreading wide his broad emblem, he will then grant to us the
sustenance for mortals.
### 4
These songs here reverently invoke Savitar of good tongue and good  palms, whose fists are full.
Let him confer on us brilliant, lofty vigor. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.
## 46 
46 (562) Rudra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
4 verses: jagatī 1–3, triṣṭubh 4
This brief hymn primarily begs Rudra to restrain his characteristic power to do  harm, though it also mentions in passing his healing and helpful gifts (vss. 3–4).
### 1
Bring these songs to Rudra, whose bow is taut and whose arrow is swift,  to the god of independent power,
to the unvanquishable, vanquishing adept whose weapons are sharp. Let  him hear us.
### 2
For in consequence of his dwelling place he takes cognizance of the  earthly race and, in consequence of his universal rule, of the heavenly. Providing help, proceed toward our doors that provide help (in return).  Bring no affliction to our children, Rudra.
### 3
The missile of yours, which, shot downward from heaven, circles around  the earth—let it avoid us.
A thousand are your remedies, o you who are our familiar. Do no harm  to our offspring and descendants.
### 4
Do not smite us, Rudra. Do not deliver us up. Let us not be in the toils  of you in your anger.
Give us a share in the ritual grass and in the praise of the living. – Do  you protect us always with your blessings.
## 47 
47 (563) Waters
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
4 verses: triṣṭubh
The waters are celebrated here primarily in their ritual employment, in the prepara tion of soma—though soma itself is not explicitly mentioned. These waters come to  be replaced by the rivers in the last two verses (3–4), but their physical characteris tics are not mentioned either. However, the final pāda before the refrain (4c) alludes  to the rivers’ making “wide space” for us, quite possibly an allusion to the enlarging  of the Ārya territory by crossing and conquering rivers.
### 1
O Waters, your wave of refreshments that those devoted to the gods  made Indra’s first drink—
it, gleaming and unbesmirched, showering ghee and filled with honey,  might we win today.
### 2
That wave of yours, o Waters, most filled with honey—let the Child of  the Waters who impels swift (horses) help it.
That on which Indra, along with the Vasus, will bring himself to
exhilaration, that one of yours might we, seeking the gods, attain today. 3. Possessing a hundred filters, delighting in their independent power, the  goddesses [=Waters] merge into the fold of the gods.
They do not confound the commandments of Indra. To the rivers pour  an oblation filled with ghee.
### 4
Toward whom the sun has stretched out with its rays, for whom Indra  has dug out a way, a wave,
do you, o Rivers, provide wide space for us. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.
## 48 
48 (564) R̥bhus
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
4 verses: triṣṭubh
The three R̥bhus are most commonly named R̥bhu, Vāja, and Vibhvan, and they  stand alongside Indra, who is sometimes called r̥bhukṣán “Master of the R̥bhus,”
942 VII.49
although r̥bhukṣán can also be a description or name for R̥bhu, as it clearly is in 3c  and must also be in 1a. Here as elsewhere the three R̥bhus can be invoked by the  name of any one of them in the plural. A partial exception is that the stem vibhván or víbhvan is replaced by víbhū or vibhú in the plural to name Vibhvan and the  other two R̥bhus. Further, in this hymn verse 2 employs víbhvaḥ as an equivalent to  víbhvā(m̐), the nominative of Vibhvan. Although the use of the plural of one name  to designate the three gods is peculiar in translation, we have retained the Vedic  idiom to avoid prolonging the addresses to the gods.
The complex mixing of stems and singular and plural forms in such a short  hymn suggests that the poet is deliberately drawing attention to the names of the  R̥bhus and their meanings. Such a strategy is probably behind the repetitions in  verse 2, which mentions “R̥bhu with the R̥bhus,” then “Vibhvan” (or more accu
rately “Vibhva”) “with the Vibhus,” and “Vāja...in winning the vā́ja.” The mean ing of r̥bhú is approximately “craftsman,” víbhū and vibhú are “far-ranging,” and  vā́ja is “prize.” These are all things or imply qualities that the sacrificers want, and  indeed in 2ab the poet asks that the sacrificers be a “R̥bhu” or “a craftsman” and a  “Vibhvan” or “far-ranging” in the company of R̥bhus and Vibhus in order to win  a vā́ja, a prize.
### 1
O R̥bhukṣans, o Vājas, among us find exhilaration in our pressed soma, o  generous men.
Like travelers’ intentions, let them [=your horses] make you, who are  turned this way, and your manly chariot roll here, o Vibhūs.
### 2
As R̥bhu with the R̥bhus, as Vibhvan with the Vibhus, we would
overcome vast powers by your vast powers.
Let Vāja help us in winning the prize (vā́ja). With Indra as our yokemate,  we would overcome our Vr̥tra [=obstacle].
### 3
Because these very ones [=Indra and the R̥bhus] overcome many
(commands) by their command, they conquer (even) in the face of the  superiority of the outsider.
Indra, Vibhvan, R̥bhukṣan, and Vāja will put away the manliness of the  outsider and of the rival by confronting it.
### 4
O gods, now make for us wide space. Be of one accord to help us. The good (gods) should give refreshment to us. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.
## 49 
49 (565) Waters
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
4 verses: triṣṭubh
In contrast to VII.47, the waters in this hymn have more physical definition: in par ticular, verse 2 gives a notable typology of types of water: “heavenly waters” (rain), “those that flow” (rivers), “those found by digging” (well water), and “those that  arise by themselves” (springs)—all of which end by flowing into the sea. But the  purity and purifying power of flowing waters, noted in the first three verses, gives  them a moral as well as a physical quality, and in verse 3 the god Varuṇa in his role  as observer and judge of human actions is found among them. From passages like  this it is easy to see how Varuṇa came to be so closely associated with the waters, a  dominant characteristic of Varuṇa in later times. Verse 4 moves from the physical  and moral to the ritual realm, to the employment of water in the soma sacrifice, the  theme that prevailed in VII.47.
### 1
They come from the middle of the (heavenly?) ocean, those whose chief  is the sea—becoming pure, never settling down,
whom the mace-bearing Indra, the bull, dug out—let those waters,
goddesses, help me here.
### 2
The heavenly waters, or those that flow, or are found by digging, or arise  by themselves,
those, clear and pure, whose goal is the sea—let those waters, goddesses,  help me here.
### 3
In the middle of which King Varuṇa travels, looking down upon the  truth and falsehood of the peoples,
those, clear and pure, that drip honey—let those waters, goddesses, help  me here.
### 4
Among which King Varuṇa, among which Soma, among which all the  gods take their nourishment for exhilaration,
into which Agni Vaiśvānara entered—let those waters, goddesses, help  me here.

50 (566) Mitra and Varuṇa (1), Agni (2), the All Gods (3), the  Rivers (4)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
4 verses: jagatī 1–3, atijagatī or śakvarī 4
This is one of the relatively few healing hymns in the R̥gveda. The hymn is included  among those to the waters because of the last verse invoking the rivers for their  help. For a translation of the hymn and notes on the various lexical problems in it,  see Zysk (1985: 28 and 130–32).
The afflictions against which this hymn is recited center on the feet. The reference  to the “creeping thing” in the refrain of 1–3 led Velankar (1963) to propose that the  hymn is for treatment against different kinds of poison but especially against snake  venom. However, the symptoms and the causes of the foot problems, even though  they are too unclear to determine, appear to be varied. Zysk (p. 131) identifies the  “creeping thing” as the ajakāva (vs. 1), “an evil-looking, crawling animal...which944 VII.51
was known to have lived under the skin and to have formed a swelling or eruption”  (pp. 25–26). However, the ajakāva could also be referred to in 1b and therefore be  an ulcer or a swelling, if, as Renou (EVP XVI: 111) suggests, “the nesting thing”  is a skin lesion in contrast to a “swelling thing” on the skin. Likewise, we cannot  identify the vijāman joint, although it could be located in the foot, since the erup
tion apparently spreads from it to the ankles and knees. And, as Zysk (pp. 131–32)  argues, the last verse probably refers to two kinds of female demons, the śipadā and  śimidā, who polluted waters and caused the foot problems.
### 1
Guard me here, Mitra and Varuṇa. Do not let the nesting or the swelling  thing come upon us.
I put the ajakāva of vile appearance out of sight. – Let not the creeping  thing find me, bringing a disease of the foot.
### 2
What eruption will appear on the vijāman joint and will become smeared  over the knees and ankles,
let blazing Agni force that away from here. – Let not the creeping thing  find me, bringing a disease of the foot.
### 3
What poison is in the silk cotton tree, what in streams, and what is  produced from plants,
let the All Gods propel that away from here. – Let not the creeping thing  find me, bringing a disease of the foot.
### 4
(The rivers) that are from the slope, depth, and height, those that are  filled with water and those empty of water—
let (these) kindly (river-)goddesses, swelling with (waters as their) milk,  become for us free of śipadā-demons,
let all the rivers become free of śimidā-demons.
## 51 
51 (567) Ādityas
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is a general exhortation to the Ādityas to protect the sacrifice, keeping  its performance in “offenselessness” (adititvá), in accordance with their character as  sons of Aditi, the goddess who represents offenselessness or innocence. In the later  rite the offering of soma to Mitra and Varuṇa (as well as to the other dual divini
ties) takes place in the morning and that to the Ādityas (as well as to other divine  collectives) in the evening. The gods in the last verse are worshiped at various times  in the sacrificial day, but there appears to be an emphasis on gods associated with  the evening rite: the Ādityas, All Gods, R̥bhus, and even the Aśvins, who are con
nected with both the morning and the evening rituals.
### 1
We would be accompanied by the present help of the Ādityas and by  their most luck-bringing protection. Let the overpowering ones establish this sacrifice in guiltlessness and in  offenselessness (adititvá), listening (to us).
### 2
Let the Ādityas and Aditi find exhilaration, let Mitra, Aryaman, and  Varuṇa, who are the most straightforward.
Let the herdsmen of the living world be ours. Let them drink the soma  to help us today.
### 3
All the Ādityas, and all the Maruts, and the All Gods, and all the R̥bhus, Indra, Agni, and the two Aśvins, (all) being praised. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.
## 52 
52 (568) Ādityas
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: triṣṭubh
This short and probably late hymn has a number of unusual features. In verse 1 the  poet describes himself and his fellow sacrificers as áditi “offenseless,” and because  they are áditi they are also ādityá “Ādityas” or “sons of Aditi.” This is a surpris ing claim, and Geldner understandably softens it by turning the metaphor into a  simile. According to him, the poet asks that he and his people be offenseless like Ādityas. Were we to adopt Geldner’s approach, then in 1b we could supply a differ ent verb form and translate “there should be for us a fortress” (so Geldner) or “you  [=Ādityas] should be for us a fortress.” This solution is attractive since gods are  called fortresses in, for example, I.189.2 and VII.95.1. But there is no signal in the  text for the simile or for the ellipsis, and therefore, albeit with considerable hesita tion, we have translated the verse as if the speakers embody the “offenseless” gods.  That theme of offenselessness is continued in the next verse, in which the poet begs  that he and the sacrificers not be held responsible for the evil actions done by others.
In the last verse the poet speaks of the presence of the Aṅgirases in this sacrifice,  which suggests that the present priests now embody the legendary Aṅgiras priests,  a claim implicitly made elsewhere as well. The appeal to Savitar, who is associated  with the evening, and in verse 3d the reference to the All Gods, who in the later rite  receive offerings at the Third Pressing, place this hymn in that soma-pressing. The  identity of the “father” (vs. 3c) remains mysterious. Sāyaṇa identifies him as Varuṇa  since Varuṇa and Mitra are the fathers of Vasiṣṭha (cf. VII.33.11–13), but there is  little basis for associating Varuṇa here with either the Aṅgirases or the All Gods.
### 1
We would be offenseless (áditi) sons of Aditi, and a fortress among gods  and mortals, o Vasus.
Winning (this) we would win, o Mitra and Varuṇa. Becoming (this) we  would become greater, o Heaven and Earth.
### 2
Mitra, Varuṇa, (and the other Vasus) will be ready to give us
this: protection as our herdsmen for our kith and kin.
946 VII.53–54
Let us not suffer the guilt toward you that is born from another. Let us  not do that which you avenge, o Vasus.
### 3
The swift Aṅgirases have reached here, begging treasure of the god  Savitar;
our great father, worthy of the sacrifice, and the All Gods, of one mind,  will find pleasure in this.
## 53 
53 (569) Heaven and Earth
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: triṣṭubh
Heaven and Earth here figure just as objects of worship, not as physically conceived  entities. Verses 1–2 emphasize their antiquity and the antiquity of the poetic cel ebration of them, while verse 3 asks, as usual, for their gifts.
### 1
I urgently invoke Heaven and Earth, the lofty ones worthy of the  sacrifice, with sacrifices and acts of reverence,
for the ancient poets who also hymned them set in front those two great  ones whose sons are the gods.
### 2
With newer hymns bring forward into the seat of truth the two
ancient-born parents.
O Heaven and Earth, journey here to us with the divine folk. Great is  your protection.

54 (570) Lord of the Dwelling Place (Vāstospati) ̣
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: triṣṭubh
This short hymn (but also see the first verse of the next one) is addressed to the  personified guardian spirit of the house and household and in later ritual is recited  for entry into a new house.
### 1
O Lord of the Dwelling Place, greet us. Become easy to enter and  without affliction for us.
When we entreat you, favor us in return: become weal for our
two-footed, weal for our four-footed. 2. O Lord of the Dwelling Place, be one who furthers us, fattening the  livestock with cows, with horses, o drop.
In your companionship might we be unaging. Like a father his sons,  favor us in return.

O Lord of the Dwelling Place, might we be accompanied by your capable  fellowship, joy-bringing, providing the way.
Protect us at will in peace and war. – Do you protect us always with your  blessings.

55 (571) Lord of the Dwelling Place (Vāstospati) (1), Sleep ̣ Incantations (2–8)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
8 verses: gāyatrī 1, upariṣṭādbrhat ̥ ī 2–4, anuṣṭubh 5–8
As was noted in the introduction to VII.54, the first verse of this hymn, dedicated  to the Lord of the Dwelling Place, really belongs with the previous hymn—though  it was not simply wrongly divided from that hymn: it is in a different meter, and the  final verse of VII.54 ends with the Vasiṣṭha clan refrain, which is always the final  pāda of the hymns in which it is found.
What follows this first verse is one of the most beloved and most delightful of  R̥gvedic hymns, a sleep charm, a species of lullaby. It is divided into two parts by  the meter (vss. 2–4, 5–8), but forms a conceptual unity. Verses 2–4 are addressed to  a dog, presumably a watchdog barking in the night, who is urged to go to sleep. The  dog is given a grand metronymic, “son of Saramā,” the legendary bitch of Indra,  who on Indra’s behalf tracked down the cows stolen by the Paṇis and retrieved  them, in the memorable dialogue hymn X.108.
The next two verses (5–6) are an incantatory listing of each member of the house hold, sending them all to sleep one by one (reminiscent of the modern American  children’s book Goodnight Moon). The next verse (7) puts them all to sleep with the  moonrise, with the final verse devoted to an intriguing set of unidentified women  falling asleep wherever they happen to be. This fleeting picture of somnolent ladies  reminds us of several similar famous scenes in much later Indian literature, such as  the sleeping rākṣasīs in Rāvaṇa’s household in Laṅka in the Rāmāyaṇa (V.7.30–62,  8.30–46) and the sleeping women whose fleshy sensuality disgusts Siddhārtha, the  future Buddha, in Aśvaghoṣa’s Buddhacarita (V.47–67).
A number of fanciful scenarios have been devised, both ancient and modern,  Indian and Western, as the backstory of this hymn, but this creative plotting seems  unnecessary: the hymn can be simply enjoyed for itself.
### 1
Destroying affliction, o Lord of the Dwelling Place, entering all forms, be a companion well disposed to us.
948 VII.56
### 2
When, o silvery son of Saramā, you bare your teeth, tawny one,
they glint like spears, in the jaws of (you) who are snapping. Go to sleep! 3. Bark at the thief, o son of Saramā, or at the robber, you who lunge (at  them) again and again.
You are barking at the praisers of Indra. Why do you torment us? Go  to sleep!
### 4
Keep tearing at the boar; let the boar keep tearing at you.
You are barking at the praisers of Indra. Why do you torment us? Go  to sleep!
### 5
Let the mother sleep, let the father sleep; let the dog sleep, let the  clanlord sleep.
Let all the relations sleep; let this folk round about sleep.
### 6
Whoever sits still and whoever wanders, and whoever sees
us—such folk—
their eyes do we slam shut—just like this house.
### 7
The thousand-horned bull who rises up from the sea [=moon],
with this mighty one we make the folks sleep.
### 8
The ladies lying on benches, those lying on litters, those lying on beds, the women of pleasant scent—all these do we make sleep.
## 56 
56 (572) Maruts
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
25 verses: dvipadā virāj 1–11, triṣṭubh 12–25
This hymn is structured like VII.34, an All God hymn, in that the first part is in the  short dvipadā meter and the second part in triṣṭubh, although the proportions of  verses in each meter are different. It also shares a final verse with VII.34, a generic  plea for the gods’ protection. But in content there is little in common between the  two hymns.
This hymn begins with four verses about the birth and identity of the Maruts,  alluding both to their mysterious generation from Pr̥śni (see esp. vs. 4) and the para dox that they are both identical (“belonging to the same nest,” vs. 1) and separate  and rivalrous. This theme then disappears from the hymn, save for several refer ences to their plural “names” (vss. 10, 14; we of course know them only under one  name, “Maruts”). The rest of the dvipadā section (vss. 5–11) is essentially descrip tive, of their power, beauty, and accoutrements.
Although this celebration of the Maruts’ qualities continues in the triṣṭubh por tion, there is also a significant ritual component, initiated in the first half of verse  12. Subsequent verses make clear what ritual is involved: in verse 14 it is said that  they are worshiped at the beginning of the sacrifice, and they are invited to enjoy  the House-offering; in verse 16 they are called “playful.” In middle Vedic ritual  the third and last of the “Four-monthly” (Cāturmāsyāni) rituals is the Sākamedha, celebrated in the autumn. On the day before the Sākamedha day proper, the  Maruts receive two oblations—thus, they are worshiped at the beginning of the  sacrifice. Moreover, the second of these two oblations is the “House-offering”  (Gr̥hamedhīya). And on the next day there is an offering to the “playful Maruts,”  using the same word that describes their behavior in verse 16d. (For further refer
ence to the Maruts at the Sākamedha in this Marut cycle, see VII.59.9–10. On the  ritual itself see, e.g., Hillebrandt 1897: 117–19; Keith 1925: 322–23.) As usual, offerings to the gods prompt us to ask for reciprocal benefits from the  gods, and these requests occupy much of the remaining verses (17–24), with the  final refrain verse (25) extending the requests to other gods as well. The last few  request verses specific to the Maruts (vss. 22–24) ask for their help in battles over  land and waters, alluding presumably to the Ārya expansion.
### 1
Who, separately, are these anointed superior men who belong to the  same nest—

For no one knows their (separate) births.
But certainly they know, mutually, each his own separate means of
begetting.
### 3
They sprinkled each other mutually, each with his own self-purifying  (rain drops? semen?).
The falcons with the wind’s roar contended among themselves.

These are the secrets the insightful one perceives:
what great Pr̥śni bore as her udder.
### 5
Let this clan be possessed of good heroes in (the form of) Maruts, the clan prevailing from of old, fostering its manly power.
### 6
Best driving their drive, most beautiful in beauty, supplied with  splendor, strong with strengths—
### 7
Strong is your strength, steadfast your forces. Thus the flock with its  Maruts is powerful.
### 8
Beautiful is your bluster, raging are the minds of the bold troop, like a  raving ecstatic.
### 9
Keep your missile away from us, with all its gear;
let your ill-will not reach us here.
### 10
I call the dear names of you precipitate ones,
when you are here bellowing to your hearts’ content, o Maruts.
### 11
They are possessed of good weapons and arrows, of lovely
neck-ornaments,
and are themselves beautifying their own bodies.
### 12
Gleaming are the oblations for you gleaming ones, o Maruts. I set in  motion a gleaming ceremonial course for the gleaming ones.
By truth the servers of truth came to reality—the gleaming ones of  gleaming birth, pure.

### 13
On your shoulders, Maruts, are spangles, on your breasts brilliants are  being set.
Like lightning flashes shining forth with the rains, (you are) holding  yourselves ready with your weapons according to your nature.
### 14
Your deep-grounded great powers rise forth. Set forth your names, you  who are worshiped at the forefront of the sacrifice.
Enjoy this thousandfold domestic portion of the House-offering, o  Maruts.
### 15
If, Maruts, you give study to what is praised in just this way at the  invocation of the prizewinning inspired poet,
right away give of wealth consisting of heroes, which another man, a  non-giver, will never swindle.
### 16
The Maruts, well directed like racehorses—the young bloods beautify  themselves to look like wondrous apparitions;
they are beautiful like children who live in a grand house, playful like  calves still suckling.
### 17
Showing favor, let the Maruts be merciful to us, as they make the two  well-fixed world-halves spacious.
Let your cow-smiting, man-smiting weapon stay at a distance. With  benevolent thoughts bow to us, good ones.
### 18
The Hotar, once installed, keeps calling for your giving to be  completely directed hither, Maruts, while he is himself being  hymned.
He who is the herdsman of such (wealth), o bulls, without duplicity he  calls upon you with solemn words.
### 19
These Maruts here bring the hasty to a halt; they make might bow  to might.
They protect the laud from the rapacious; they establish heavy hatred  for the ungenerous.

These Maruts here spur on even the feeble, likewise also the whirlwind,  in whatever way the good ones please.
Thrust aside the dark shades, o bulls. Confer all life and lineage on us. 21. Let us not miss out on your gift, o Maruts; let us not lag behind at the  distribution, o charioteers.
Give us a share in the goods we crave, whatever you have of good  quality, o bulls.
### 22
When the peoples, the champions clash together in frenzies at (contests  for) the boisterous (rivers), the plants, and the clans,
then, o Maruts, Rudriyas, become our rescuers in the battles with the  stranger.
### 23
Maruts, you have given rise to many solemn speeches from the  Forefathers, which have been recited to you long since: along with the Maruts the strong one is the victor in battles; just along  with the Maruts does the charger win the prize.
### 24
Beside us let there be a forceful hero, o Maruts, who is lord and  apportioner for the people,
with whom we might cross over the waters to good dwelling. Then,
(thanks to) you, might we dominate our own home.
### 25
Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, Agni, the waters, the plants, the trees shall enjoy  this of ours.
May we be in the shelter, in the lap of the Maruts. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.

57 (573) Maruts
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
Ritual offering to the Maruts is the subject of this whole hymn, although, unlike  the preceding hymn, no specific ritual is referred to. The hymn begins with an invita tion offered to the Maruts to the sacrificial “honey” (soma), an invitation phrased  in a way very close to the English idiom indicating potential possession “has their  name on it” (at least in our interpretation). They travel to the sacrifice and, having  received the guest reception, are asked to sit on the ritual grass, to receive the obla tion (vs. 2). The sacrifice is successfully concluded in verse 5, and their help and gifts  requested. The last two verses (6–7) seem to be a summary of the ritual process—in  6 they are urged to come in pursuit of oblations, in 7 to come in order to give help
in return—the two verses being unified by the opening “when praised.” Verse 4 is somewhat odd in a Marut context. Although it is common to beg the  Maruts to keep their missile away from us (see, e.g., the preceding hymn, VII.56.9),  the reference to an “offense” committed by us humans is more appropriate to a  Varuṇa or Āditya context: see especially the use of the term in the Vasiṣṭha-Varuṇa  hymns later in this maṇḍala (VII.86.4, 87.7, 88.6), since the Maruts are not usually  associated with moral issues (though see vs. 5 in the next hymn, VII.58). Much  more typical is the lovely description of the glittering Maruts in verse 3.
### 1
Your honey has the name “Marut,” o you who deserve the sacrifice. At  the sacrifices they become invigorated with its strength:
they who set even the two wide world-halves to trembling, the mighty  ones swell the wellspring, when they have journeyed.
### 2
It’s surely the Maruts who take note of the singer, who lead forward the  thought of the sacrificer.
Sit on our ritual grass today, having been graciously received, to pursue  (the oblations) at the rites of distribution.
952 VII.58
### 3
The others do not glitter like these Maruts here, with their brilliants,  their weapons, their bodies.
All adorned, themselves adorning the two world-halves, they smear a  common unguent on themselves for beauty.
### 4
Let your missile stay aside, Maruts. When we will do offense to you in  our human fashion,
let us not come into its way [=missile], o you who deserve the sacrifice.  Let your most delightful favor rest in us.
### 5
The Maruts have taken pleasure in what has been done here
[=sacrifice]—those faultless, gleaming, pure ones.
Promote us with your favors, o you who deserve the sacrifice. Further us  with prizes for our thriving.
### 6
And, when praised by all their names, let the Maruts, superior men,  pursue the oblations.
Give of immortality to our progeny; awaken riches, liberalities, bounties. 7. When praised, o Maruts, come hither, all of you in your totality, with  help to the patrons,
who, possessing hundreds, strengthen us by themselves. – Do you protect  us always with your blessings.

58 (574) Maruts
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭub
A description of the fearsome power of the Maruts, embodiments of the thun derstorm, begins the hymn (vss. 1–2), but the topic turns to their power to help  the poet and his patrons in verses 3–4, with the mythic model, their aid to Indra,  invoked briefly in verse 4. In verse 5 the potential anger of the Maruts is men tioned, and we seek to atone for whatever act occasioned it. Like the human  offense punished in verse 4 of the previous hymn, VII.57, this moral tone is  somewhat out of place in a Marut hymn. However, here the reference to the  Maruts’ father, Rudra the punisher and healer, provides a better context for this  scene of anger and atonement. The final verse (6) is a summary verse, referring  to the performance in the immediate past of the praise hymn that constitutes the  first five verses.
### 1
Chant forth to the flock, grown strong all together, which has the power  of its divine nature.
They pound the two world-halves with their greatness; they reach to the  vault from chaos, from propless (space).
### 2
Even your birth, Maruts, (was attended) by turbulence, you fearsome  ones, of powerful battle fury, unruly, who stand out because of their great powers and their strength.
Everyone who sees the sun takes fear at your journey.
### 3
Impart lofty vigor to our bounteous (patrons). Only the Maruts shall  enjoy our good praise.
Like a road when it’s traveled, (the flock) will bring the people across;  may it further us with the help we crave.
### 4
Aided by you, Maruts, the inspired poet gets hundreds; aided by you, the  charger is victorious, bringing thousands;
aided by you, (Indra) is sovereign king and smites Vr̥tra. Let this giving  of yours stand out, you shakers.
### 5
I seek to entice here these (sons) of Rudra the rewarder. Surely the  Maruts will bow to us again?
If they are angry in secret, if openly, we make recompense for this
transgression to the forceful ones.
### 6
The good praise hymn of the bounteous ones has been proclaimed: this  is the hymn the Maruts enjoy.
Even from a distance keep away hatred, you bulls. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.

59 (575) Maruts (1–11), Rudra (12)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
12 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī 1–6, arranged in pragāthas, triṣṭubh 7–8,  gāyatrī 9–11, anuṣṭubh 12
As the variety of meters suggests, this is a composite hymn, with some of the sec tions clearly appended at the end of the Marut sequence. Its length confirms this  analysis, since the previous hymn contained only six verses.
The first six verses consist of three pairs of pragāthas concerning the ritual ser vice offered first to a collection of gods (vs. 1, probably vs. 2) and then particularly  to the Maruts (vss. 3–6) and the benefits that accrue to the sacrificer. Vasiṣṭha names  himself in verse 3. This six-verse sequence conforms to the numerical pattern of the  Marut cycle and could have been original to it. The following two triṣṭubh verses  (7–8) continue the same theme, though more vividly. In particular, in verse 7 the  Maruts are compared to “dark-backed geese,” preening themselves in secret and  then flying here. This may be a reference to how quickly storms can seem to arise,  with thunderclouds fully developed (“preened in secret”).
The last four verses are clearly late additions. They make reference to the  Sākamedha rite encountered also in VII.56.14, the last of the Four-monthly rituals  described in middle Vedic texts. In verse 9 the Maruts are called “descendants of the  scorcher” (sā́ṃtapana), in verse 10 “sharers of the House-offering” (gŕ̥hamedha);  at the Sākamedha the Maruts as Sāṃtapana receive an offering at midday, and in954 VII.59
the evening as Gr̥hamedha. The final verse (12), in a different meter, is dedicated  to “Tryambaka,” an epithet of Rudra. The Sākamedha ends with an oblation to  Rudra Tryambaka.
### 1
Whom you safeguard, o gods, and whom you lead right up here, to him—o Agni, Varuṇa, Mitra, Aryaman, Maruts—extend shelter.
### 2
With the help of you, o gods, on a favorable day the one who has  sacrificed crosses over hatreds.
He furthers his dwelling place, ex(tends) his great refreshments, who  does ritual service to your liking.
### 3
Vasiṣṭha will certainly not neglect even the last of you:
when our (soma) is pressed today, o Maruts, drink it avidly, all of you. 4. Your help in battles certainly does not desert him to whom you have  granted it, o men.
Your favor has turned here anew. Drive straightaway, you who desire  to drink.
### 5
You of ardent generosity, drive here to drink the stalks.
Here are the oblations for you, o Maruts. Because I have bestowed
them, don’t go somewhere else.
### 6
Sit here on our ritual grass and undertake to give us coveted goods. O unfailing Maruts, you will exhilarate yourselves here on the somian  honey—Hail!
### 7
Surely even in secret they keep preening their bodies. The dark-backed  geese have flown here.
As a whole troop you have sat down all around me, like battle-lusty
men, becoming exhilarated on the pressing.
### 8
O Maruts, whoever, being evilly angry at us and at cross-purposes, seeks  to strike us, you good ones,
may he be fastened to the fetters of deceit. With your most scorching  stroke strike him.
### 9
You descendants of the scorcher, Maruts, enjoy this oblation here. (Come here) with your help, you who care for the stranger.
### 10
Come here, you sharers of the House-offering—Maruts, don’t
stay away—
with your help, you of good drops.
### 11
Here, just here—you self-strong, sun-skinned poets—
I will you (to come) here to (my) sacrifice, o Maruts.
### 12
We sacrifice to Tryambaka the fragrant, increaser of prosperity.
Like a cucumber from its stem, might I be freed from death, not from  deathlessness.

60 (576) Mitra and Varuṇa
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
12 verses: triṣṭubh
The opening four verses describe the rising Sun, who watches over the good and  evil that people do. As such, he is the agent of Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman,  since they are the gods whose central character is to govern the actions of mor tals. In verses 3–4 the poet blends the offerings that rise to the gods at dawn with  the antelopes of the Sun that carry him aloft. These antelopes are “rich in ghee”  (vs. 3), as the offerings would be. In verse 4 the “strengthening, honeyed ones”  are primarily the offerings given to Mitra and Varuṇa, but juxtaposed to the  Sun’s ascent and to the description of his antelopes, they also become reflections  of these antelopes, lifting the Sun to the heaven. In 4cd the Ādityas clear a path  for the Sun, and this image leads to the principal theme of the succeeding verses  and of the hymn itself—the ability of the Ādityas to lead even through difficult  circumstances. The Ādityas keep away those who oppose the truths they embody  (vs. 5), and they guide even those who may not understand their truths (vss. 6–7).  The “unwinking, perceptive ones” in 7a might be the gods themselves, although  they could also be the spies of Mitra and Varuṇa, who are described in similar  ways (cf. VII.61.3, 5) and who would be present both in heaven and on earth (cf.  VI.61.3).
If there is benefit in following the Ādityas, there is also danger in not doing so.  The poet warns of the anger of the Ādityas (vs. 8), the hostility of Aryaman (vs.  9), the secret attack they can bring, and the hidden strength they possess (vs. 10).  All this leaves the poet and his people “trembling” (vs. 10) before them. The sense  of danger, either from those who do not follow the ways of the Ādityas or from  not following those ways, is strongly articulated in the second half of the hymn.  It is also here that the hymn designates Sudās, the king, as the special recipient of  the Ādityas’ protection and mercy (vss. 8, 9). This may point toward a time in  which the king and his people were trying to find and to establish a settlement  after the normal period of migration and battle, a time that might well be one of  particular peril.
### 1
If today as you arise, o Sun, you who are free of offense will speak the  truth [=that we are free of offense] to Mitra and Varuṇa,
we would be (offenseless) before the gods, Aditi, and dear to you,
Aryaman, as we sing.
### 2
O Mitra and Varuṇa, this very Sun, who draws the gaze of men, rises up  over both [=standing and moving beings] on earth—
the herdsman of everything, (both) the standing and the moving, seeing  the straight and crooked (acts) among mortals.
### 3
He has harnessed from his abode his seven antelopes, which, rich in ghee,  convey him, the Sun,
956 VII.60
who, seeking you, o Mitra and Varuṇa, surveys your domains and the  tribes (of men), like your herds.
### 4
The strengthening, honeyed ones [=offerings] belonging to you two  have risen up, and the Sun has mounted the gleaming flood—
he for whom the Ādityas—Mitra, Aryaman, and Varuṇa all together— clear his roads.
### 5
These are the avengers of much untruth, for they are Mitra, Aryaman,  and Varuṇa.
These have grown strong in the house of truth—the capable,
undeceivable sons of Aditi.
### 6
These hard to deceive—Mitra, Varuṇa, (and Aryaman)—cause even the  unperceptive man to perceive through their skills.
Fully knowing the resolve based on good perception, they lead by a  good path even across narrow straits.
### 7
These unwinking, perceptive ones of heaven and of earth lead the  unperceptive man.
Even in the onrush of a stream there is a ford. They will bring us across  to the far shore of this peril.
### 8
Since Aditi, Mitra, and Varuṇa offer their welcome herdsmanlike  protection to Sudās,
let us, securing our kith and kin under it, not do that which angers the  gods, o overpowering ones.
### 9
By his libations he should ritually cleanse the altar of any
double-dealing that deceives Varuṇa.
Let Aryaman with his hostilities avoid (him [=Sudās], creating) a wide  world for Sudās, o you two bulls.
### 10
Because their fiery attack is even in secret and they are strong with  hidden strength,
(we are) trembling in fear before you, bulls—by the greatness of your  very skill, have mercy on us!
### 11
Who by sacrifice will gain your favor for his formulation at the winning  of victory’s prize and of the highest wealth,
his generous patrons will strive to overpower the battle fury of the  outsider. They have made for themselves a wide and secure place for  their dwelling.
### 12
This installation of the god [=Agni] to the fore has been made for you  two, Mitra and Varuṇa.
Take us across all difficulties. – Do you protect us always with your  blessings.
## 61
61 (577) Mitra and Varuṇa
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
Like the preceding hymn, with which it shares its final verse, this hymn begins with  a description of the rising Sun, who here is the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa, watch ing over the good and evils deeds of humans. In verse 2 the rising Sun parallels  the voice of the poet, who raises his hymn to Mitra and Varuṇa. And just as the  Sun fills the worlds with light, Mitra and Varuṇa penetrate all the worlds and even  go beyond them. Like kings who send their agents into the communities to note  what their subjects are doing and saying, Mitra and Varuṇa also have spies who are  everywhere (vs. 3).
The mention of these spies in verse 3 may help explain the most problematic  verse in the hymn, verse 5. There are several ways to construe the verse: ámūrā víśvā could be vocative and nominative dual respectively, describing Mitra and  Varuṇa as those who can never be fooled (so Geldner), but more likely they  describe the drúhaḥ “deceptions” in 5c. As Oldenberg notes, grammatically dis persing the phrase ámūrā víśvā(ḥ). . . imā́ḥ “all these who are never fooled” seems  forced. But the idea that Mitra and Varuṇa themselves deceive has understand ably given interpreters pause. Still, in X.109.4 Indra is said never to be deceived  but himself deceiving (√dabh) and in the previous hymn, in VII.60.9c, Aryaman  can bring “hostilities” against those who do not act rightly. The “deceptions”  of Mitra and Varuṇa are probably their hidden spies. These spies are actually  not seen and accordingly in this verse they are unidentified and hence verbally  hidden. The verse even works a deception of its own, describing the spies in the  feminine plural—spáśaḥ “spies” is masculine plural—and delaying the feminine  term that stands for them, drúhaḥ, until pāda c.
### 1
Upward arises the eye of lovely appearance that belongs to you two gods,  o Varuṇa—the Sun, who has extended himself.
He who watches over all living beings marks the battle fury among
mortals.
### 2
Truth-possessing, the far-famed inspired poet raises his thoughts forth to  you, o Mitra and Varuṇa—
he whose formulations you will help, o you of strong will, when you two  will bring his autumns to fullness, as if by his will.
### 3
(You have reached) past the wide (midspace), past the earth, o Mitra and  Varuṇa, past the high heaven aloft, o you who bring good gifts.
You have placed your spies among the plants and among the clans,
guarding unwinkingly against him who goes his own way.
### 4
I shall praise the institutes of Mitra and Varuṇa: in its greatness their  unbridled power ever presses upon the two world-halves.
958 VII.62
The months of those not sacrificing will pass without bringing heroes,  but he whose thoughts belong to the sacrifice will extend his
settlement.

O you two bulls, all these of yours who are never fooled, among whom  has been seen neither sign nor wonder—
(these, your) deceptions!—follow the untruths of men. There have not  been secrets that cannot be perceived by you two.

I make the sacrifice great for you two with my acts of reverence; eagerly  I call upon you two, Mitra and Varuṇa;

62 (578) Sūrya (1–3), Mitra and Varuṇa (4–6)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
As in the two previous hymns, the poet begins with the rising Sun, who shines down  upon all the Ārya tribes and fills the heaven with his light and therefore becomes  equal to heaven (vs. 1). The antelopes of the Sun carry him up, as do the praise  songs as they rise, and from heaven the Sun witnesses the deeds of humans and  attests to the Ādityas and Agni the innocence of the sacrificers (vs. 2). In verse 3 the  poet asks that Varuṇa, Mitra, and Agni bring them the highest arká. The primary  meaning of arká is “chant,” and therefore the first idea is that these gods will inspire  the chant of the sacrificers. But arká can carry a secondary meaning, “flame,” a  sense that is actualized here through the description of the gods as candrá “glitter ing” and by arcís “flame,” the latter etymologically related to arká in this meaning.  So like the Sun these gods will brighten themselves and also make bright the world  of the sacrificers.
In verse 4 three gods—Heaven and Earth and Aditi, the mother of the Ādityas— are addressed in pāda a, but the remainder of ab refers only to two gods, Heaven  and Earth. The poet continues to address two gods in verse 5, revealing only in the  last pāda that the two gods are Mitra and Varuṇa. Finally, in the last verse the poet  matches the image of light spreading over earth and heaven that was introduced in  the first verse with the “wide space” across generations and the freedom of move
ment that Mitra and Varuṇa will offer.
Although the poet does not continue the strategy through the whole hymn,  verses 1–2 have a striking number of sound repetitions. Thus 1d is krátvā kr̥táḥ súkr̥taḥ kartŕ̥bhir bhūt, 2b ebhí stómebhir etaśébhir évaiḥ, and 2d (á)nāgaso aryamṇé agnáye ca. In verse 2 the sound repetitions underscore the tie between the Sun’s ani mals and the praise songs and the bonds between Aryaman, Agni, and the innocent  sacrificers.
### 1
The Sun has raised up his flames aloft, (facing) all the many tribes of  Manu’s sons.
Radiating, he is visible as the equal to heaven. Created by their will, he  has become well created by his creators.
### 2
O Sun, you have arisen in front facing us with these praise songs, with  your coursers in their usual ways.
You will proclaim us to Mitra and Varuṇa to be without offense, and to  Aryaman and to Agni.
### 3
Let those possessing the truth—Varuṇa, Mitra, and Agni—clear the way  to a thousand ritual gifts for us.
Let the glittering ones offer us the highest chant [/flame]. Being praised,  let them fulfill our wish.
### 4
O Heaven and Earth, o Aditi, you two should rescue us, (and so also  should) those good birth-givers [=the gods] who gave birth to you two,  o you two on high.
Let us not be in the anger of Varuṇa or of Vāyu, nor in that of Mitra,  most dear to men.
### 5
Stretch forth your arms for us to live. Sprinkle our pasture-land
with ghee.
Make us famed among the people, you two youths. Hear these my
invocations, Mitra and Varuṇa.

Now let Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman provide wide space for ourselves  and for our offspring.
Let all our paths be easy to travel. – Do you protect us always with your  blessings.

63 (579) Sūrya (1–5ab), Mitra and Varuṇa (5cd–6)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
Even more than the other hymns in the sequence VII.60–65, this hymn concen trates on the rising Sun. Here the Sun becomes the visible sign and the embodiment  of the Ādityas. He is the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa (vs. 1) and subhága “bringing  good fortune,” like Bhaga, the god Fortune (vs. 1). But the Sun is especially like the  god Savitar, the “Impeller.” He is prasavitár, who “impels forth” (vs. 2); he takes  the form of Savitar (vs. 3); and the people are impelled (prasūtá) by him (vs. 4).  The god Savitar especially drives living beings to their homes at night, so here the
960 VII.63
Sun assumes the complementary function of impelling them forth to their various  daytime tasks.
The Sun is also the fire common to all the Vedic peoples. He is the “common  support of the sons of Manu,” creating a cultural or even possibly a political unity  among them (vs. 1) and the “common wheel” (vs. 2), whose turning commences the  day and the activities of the day. Representing Savitar, the Sun upholds the “com
mon institute” (vs. 3) that governs all the peoples.
In verse 5b, the images of the herd and the falcon are puzzling. If the herd  belongs to the frame as we have translated the verse, then it is probably the  gods whom the Sun follows as they clear a road for him across the sky. On the  other hand, if the herd is part of the comparison, then a hungry falcon might  follow a herd of cattle because the cattle would attract birds, which could  become its prey. Of course it is also possible, even likely, that the poem legit
imately allows both interpretations. See also IV.38.5, in which there are like  uncertainties.
### 1
Upward he rises, bringing good fortune and with his gaze on everything,  the common support of the sons of Manu—the Sun,
the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa, the god who has rolled together the shades  of darkness like hides.
### 2
And upward he rises, the one impelling the peoples forth—the great,  undulating beacon of the Sun,
about to turn the common wheel that Etaśa pulls, harnessed on the
yoke poles.
### 3
Gleaming forth from the lap of the Dawns, he rises upward, being  celebrated by the husky-voiced singers.
He appears to me as the god Savitar, who does not violate the common  institute.
### 4
The bright ornament of heaven, having a broad gaze, rises upward— he whose goal is in the far distance, gleaming as he crosses over
(toward it).
Now the peoples, impelled forth by the Sun, will go toward their goals,  and they will perform their tasks.
### 5
Where the immortals have made a way for him, he follows after the herd  [=the gods?], flying like a falcon.
When the sun has risen, we would worship you two with our acts of  reverence and with our oblations, o Mitra and Varuṇa.
### 6
Now let Mitra, Varuṇa, and Aryaman provide wide space for ourselves  and for our offspring.
Let all our paths be easy to travel. – Do you protect us always with your  blessings.
## 64
64 (580) Mitra and Varuṇa
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is a prayer to the Ādityas for rain, as the poet makes explicit in verse  2cd. Geldner rightly sees the likelihood of a double reading of verse 1. The “cloaks  of ghee” are butter offerings given to Mitra and Varuṇa, but at the same time they  are rain that the Ādityas send in response to these offerings. So also in verse 4, the  “ghee” that Mitra and Varuṇa should sprinkle on the composer of this hymn is  rain. As a result of the rain, the dwellings of the sacrificers will prosper (4cd, 5c).
As often, the middle verse of the hymn is more cryptic than the others. Mitra and  Varuṇa are addressed, as is the devó aryáḥ, translated here the “civilizing god” and  referring to Aryaman. The point of mentioning Aryaman in such an indirect way  is to create a verbal connection between the devó aryáḥ and the arí, the “stranger”  in pāda c. An arí is an outsider, but one who belongs to the Vedic peoples and fol
lows the customs of the Āryas. The point is that such a stranger will recognize the  sacrificers as those who prosper because they follow the Ādityas and the ways of the  Āryas and will honor them as sudā́saḥ “good givers,” generous people. But Sudās  is also the Bharata king who figures very prominently in the Vasiṣṭha hymns, and,  inescapably, this designation must recall him. That is to say, even one who belongs  to another Vedic tribe will see that the sacrificers are “Sudāses” or like Sudās, the  great king, in their prosperity and generosity.
In verse 4, the “chariot seat” is the seat of honor here at the sacrifice, which is  implicitly imagined as a chariot, as often elsewhere.
### 1
You two who are masters of space in heaven and on earth—to you they  should give cloaks of ghee.
Mitra, well-born Aryaman, and King Varuṇa of strong rule enjoy our  oblation.
### 2
O you two kings, herdsmen of great truth, lords of the rivers, and  rulers—travel here to this place.
Send down refreshment to us and rain from heaven, o Mitra and Varuṇa,  you of lively drops.
### 3
Then let Mitra, Varuṇa, and the civilizing god [=Aryaman] lead us forth  by the most successful paths,
so that a (civilized) stranger will thereby speak of us as “good givers.”  With gods as our herdsmen, might we find exhilaration by your
refreshment!
### 4
Who will fashion for you two this chariot seat by his thought and who  will make and sustain a high vision—
sprinkle him with ghee, Mitra and Varuṇa. Bring satisfaction to our  good dwellings, o kings.
962 VII.65
### 5
This praise song, o Varuṇa, o Mitra, has been offered to each of you, like  the gleaming soma to Vāyu.
Give help to our insights. Awaken the ways to plenty. – Do you protect  us always with your blessings.

65 (581) Mitra and Varuṇa
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is similar in theme and phrasing to the preceding hymn, with which it  also shares the final verse. It too is fundamentally a prayer for rain to Mitra and  Varuṇa. There is no reference to Aryaman, although there is an indirect reference  to his function as god of customs in the poet’s description of Mitra and Varuṇa as  aryá “civilizing” (vs. 2a). Verse 4 most explicitly states the theme of the hymn. In  pāda a the poet offers the gods oblations, which include ghee and other ritual liba
tions, and in b he asks for these in return, though in the form of rain. In c we read  váram “wish” twice, once in the phrase práti... váram “at your wish,” referring to  the wish of the gods for oblations, and second in the phrase váram ā́...pr̥ṇītám “fill  our wish” for rain. Thus in both ab and cd, the poet first refers to the desire of the  gods and then his own desire.
The translation below also takes víśva “everyone” twice in the translation of  verse 1, which, like the first verse of the preceding hymn, offers a possible double  reading. According to the translation below, in pāda d Mitra and Varuṇa move  “upon the course of everyone,” that is, they follow or accompany the actions of all  beings. But yā́man “course” can also mean “entreaty,” and if construed with ācít
“attentive,” the line could also mean, “moving on the course of everyone, attentive  to the entreaty of everyone.”
### 1
When the sun has risen, I call upon you two with hymns, upon Mitra and  upon Varuṇa of purified skill,
you two, who possess imperishable and preeminent lordship, you two  moving upon the course of everyone, attentive to the entreaty of
everyone.
### 2
Because you two are lords of the gods and you two are civilizing, make  our dwellings to be nourishing.
Might we reach you two, Mitra and Varuṇa, where heaven and earth will  swell and also the days.
### 3
These two have many fetters, are bonds for untruth, and are hard to  overcome for the cheating mortal.
By your path of truth, Mitra and Varuṇa, we would cross over
difficulties, as (we would) waters by a boat. 4. (Come) here to the enjoyment of our oblation, Mitra and Varuṇa!  Sprinkle our pasture with ghee, with refreshments.
At your wish, in this place and for our people, fill our wish from the  beloved heavenly water.
### 5
This praise song, o Varuṇa, o Mitra, has been offered to each of you, like  the gleaming soma to Vāyu.
Give help to our insights. Awaken the ways to plenty. – Do you protect  us always with your blessings.

66 (582) Mitra and Varuṇa (1–3, 17–19), Ādityas (4–13), Sūrya  (14–16)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
19 verses: gāyatrī 1–9, 17–19, arranged in trcas; br ̥ hat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī 10–15, arranged in pragāthas; puraüṣṇih 16
This hymn consists of eight metrical units of various meters. The first three are three  gāyatrī tr̥cas, followed by three br̥hatī/satobr̥hatī strophes and one more gāyatrī tr̥ca.  The hymn then concludes with a final, single puraüṣṇih verse. Despite its metrical  complexity, the hymn sustains its basic themes throughout. Once again this is a  hymn recited at sunrise, and indeed the phrase “at the rising of the sun” occurs  at the beginning of three of its seven strophes (vss. 4, 7, 12). Also the beginning  of fourth strophe (vs. 14) contains a variant of the phrase, the final tr̥ca starts (vs.  16) with a reference to the rising of the sun, and the pragātha beginning at verse 10  opens with a mention of the sun. Therefore of the hymn’s eight units, only the first  tr̥ca (vss. 1–3), which establishes Mitra and Varuṇa as the dedicands of the hymn,  and the final summary invitation to Mitra and Varuṇa lack a reference to the rising  sun in its first verse. This repeated mention of the rising sun is a structuring device  that unifies the hymn despite the diversity of its meter. Thematically, the rise and  movement of the Sun across the heavens becomes the representation of the Ādityas’  lordship extending across the world.
The actions of the Ādityas are also linked with the words and action of the  ritual. This theme is introduced at the outset, when they are described as sudákṣa “of good skill” and the children of Dakṣa, the embodiment of skill and specifically  sacrificial skill (vs. 2). The gods sustain “the three divisions” (vs. 10), a phrase that  likely refers both to the divisions of the world (earth, midspace, and heaven), and  to the divisions of the ritual (the three soma-pressings). They also sustain the divi sions of time (vs. 11): the year, month, and day, but also the sacrifice and the night,  a division that could refer to the sacrificial rites by day and the continuation of the  rites across the night. The Ādityas “impel” (√sū)—a word connected with Savitar,  of course, and therefore with the Ādityas—the sacrificers and thereby bring their  rituals success and take their worshipers “across difficult straits” (vss. 4–5).964 VII.66
### 1
Let our thunderous praise song go forth with our reverence to Mitra  and Varuṇa,
the two powerfully born,
### 2
Whom the gods uphold, the two of good skill whose father is Skill, whose greatness (goes) forward to lordship.
### 3
You two, protectors of our dependents and of our bodies, o Varuṇa— bring the insights of (us) singers to success, o Mitra.
### 4
If today, at the rising of the sun, the one free of offense [=the Sun],  Mitra, Aryaman,
Savitar, and Bhaga will each impel (us),
### 5
Let this dwelling be one that ritually pursues (the gods) well. Now, o  you bringing good drops, (let those go) forth on their course
who take us across difficult straits.
### 6
And the sovereign kings and Aditi, who (are masters) of the  undeceivable command,
as kings are masters of (all that is) great.
### 7
At the rising of the sun I will sing to you two, to Mitra and Varuṇa, to Aryaman, who cares for the stranger.
### 8
With longing for wealth and gold, this thought is for power that knows  no wolf;
this inspired (thought) is for winning wisdom.
### 9
Together with our patrons, might we be these, o god Varuṇa, o Mitra: might we receive refreshment and the sun.
### 10
Many are they whose eye is the Sun, whose tongue is Agni, who  strengthen through the truth,
who sustain the three divisions by their insights, all (the divisions) by  their encompassing powers.
### 11
They who divided the year, the month, then the day; the sacrifice and  the night, then the verse—
as kings, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman have attained an
unobtainable rule.
### 12
Today for you, at the rising of the sun, with our hymns we will conceive what Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman solemnly declare. You are
charioteers of truth!
### 13
(You) possessing the truth, born of the truth, and strengthening  through the truth, (you) terrifying haters of untruth—
might we be in the most protective favor of you, o men, and might also  our patrons.
### 14
This lovely marvel [=the Sun] arises on the curve of heaven, when the swift god Etaśa conveys him, right for everyone to gaze upon. 15. For his easy passage, the seven sisters—the antelopes on his chariot— convey the Sun—
the lord of each one, head by head, and of the moving and the
standing—through the whole dusky realm altogether.
### 16
That eye, fixed in place by the gods, blazing as it ascends,
might we see for a hundred autumns. Might we live for a hundred
autumns!
### 17
With your poetic arts, o undeceivable ones, travel here in brilliance,  o Varuṇa
and Mitra, in order to drink the soma.
### 18
From heaven through your domains, o Varuṇa and Mitra, you who are  without deception—travel here.
Drink the soma, thrusting yourselves toward it.
### 19
Travel here, Mitra and Varuṇa, enjoying our offering, o noble men. Drink the soma, o you who strengthen through the truth.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: triṣṭubh
The opening verses of this hymn describe the early morning advent of the Aśvins,  when the sacrificial fire is kindled and the dawn becomes visible (vs. 2). They also  present problems of translation and interpretation that turn on the identity of the  Aśvins’ chariot. Elsewhere the Aśvins’ chariot can be the sacrifice or the hymns of  the sacrifice that bring the Aśvins to the rite. Therefore, the chariot in verse 1a is  the vehicle bringing the Aśvins. In 1c “that which” the poet recites and “that which”  serves as a messenger to awaken the Aśvins is the praise song, now become the  Aśvins’ chariot carrying the Aśvins to the rite. In verse 4 there is no explicit men tion of the chariot, but there is a complex ellipsis in 4a, which lacks both subject  and verb. The gapped subject may be the chariot, but again the chariot as the hymn  that seeks the Aśvins.
The hymn itself continues to be the focus of the poet in verses 5–6. In verse 5  he calls upon the Aśvins to advance his insight so that it will win gain for the sac rificers. While the poet previously mentioned the chariotry directly, here he refers  to the hymn using the language of competition and prizewinning appropriate for a  chariot. In verse 7 the poet also speaks of the “treasure,” the soma, which is offered  to the Aśvins along with his hymn, and he shifts attention from his “thought,” which  he offers to the Aśvins in the form of his hymn (vs. 1), to the Aśvins’ thought, which  he hopes will not be hostile to the sacrificers. In the final two verses the poet appeals  to the Aśvins to support his patrons, whose generosity and bounty he celebrates.
966 VII.67
Structurally, the hymn forms a ring, since the infinitive jarádhyai “to awaken”  and the verb ájīgar “he has awakened” in the first verse are answered in the last verse  by the imperative járatam “awaken!” However, while the translation of the ájīgar is  secure, the interpretation of neither the infinitive nor the imperative is certain. The  form jarádhyai is a hapax in the R̥gveda, and it is not clear whether it is transitive  or intransitive and, if transitive, who is being “awakened.” In the last verse, járatam
might be from same root, although it also might be from a different root and mean  “make old!”
### 1
To become awake in response to your chariot, o you two lords of men,  with a thought worthy of the sacrifice accompanying offerings,
I recite (to you) here, like a child to his parents, that which, like a
messenger, has awakened you two, o holy ones.
### 2
Agni has blazed up, being kindled among us, and the very borders of  darkness have become visible.
In the east Dawn’s beacon has come into view—(the beacon) of Heaven’s  daughter, which is being born for glory.
### 3
Now the good Hotar attends upon you with his praise songs as he recites,  o Aśvins, Nāsatyas.
Journey this way along many pathways with your sun-finding,
goods-bearing chariot.
### 4
Now, seeking you, o honey-bearing Aśvins, your (chariot carries)  you, when, seeking good things, I call upon you two at the
soma-pressing.
Let your stout horses carry you here. You will drink the well-pressed  honey drinks among us.
### 5
O gods, Aśvins, bring forward my insight—not falling short, seeking  good things—to win gain.
Help all the forms of plenty here in the competition for the prize. Do as  you are able for us with your abilities, o you lords of abilities.
### 6
Help us in these insights, Aśvins. Let our child-producing seed be  abundant.
Propagating ourselves in kith and kin, possessing good riches, we would  go to our godly pursuit of you two.
### 7
This very treasure, like a promissory portion for a companion, is set  down here for you, o honey-bearing ones, and given by us.
With thought free of anger, journey this way, to eat our oblation among  the clans of Manu’s sons.
### 8
In your single, joint trek, o energetic ones, your chariot encompasses the  seven flowing streams.
They do not become exhausted—these your surpassing (horses) of
powerful presence, which, yoked by the gods on their yoke-poles, carry  you two. 9. Be unfailing for the bounteous ones, who speed their gift of bounty  with wealth,
who extend their relationships by their liberal gifts, mingling their
bounties of cattle and of horses.
### 10
Now, hear my call, youthful ones. Journey the course that brings  refreshment, Aśvins.
Grant riches and awaken our patrons! – Do you protect us always with  your blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
9 verses: virāj 1–7, triṣṭubh 8–9
In its first four verses the hymn opens with an invitation to the Aśvins to come to  the sacrifice in the early morning and to receive the soma offerings being made to  them. In verse 3 the Aśvins come with the daughter of the Sun, Sūryā, which marks  this as a morning hymn (cf. also vs. 9). In verse 4c the vípra “inspired poet” is likely  the reciter of the hymn, but in 4ab the pressing stone also sounds as it crushes the  soma stalks, and therefore it too could be the poet in the latter half of the verse.  The stone prepares the soma offerings, so the reference to the oblations in 4c would  also be appropriate to it.
Then in the second set of four verses (vss. 5–8) the poet briefly describes great  deeds of the Aśvins and four of the past figures whom they helped. In verses 6 and  8 the poet mentions the offerings of Cyavāna havirdā́ “the giver of offerings” and  their summons (hūyámāna) by Śayu, words that echo the present offerings (havís,  2b) and the calls to the Aśvins (hávana, 2c).
Verse 5 alludes to the story of Atri, who was rescued from the heat of a pit oven  by the Aśvins and who received sustenance from them. That is to say, the Aśvins  rescued him with food and from becoming treated like food. In this verse the poet  refers to the “sustenance” (bhójana) and the “relief” (omán) Atri receives. Similarly,  in I.116.8 the Aśvins give Atri “nourishment together with solid food” (pitumátīm  ū́rjam) and in 118.7 they give “nourishment” and “relief” (ū́rjam omā́nam). Geldner  suggests that Atri receives from the Aśvins an elixir that restores him to life, but  these descriptions suggest more mundane gifts of food and drink that saved Atri  from starvation.
In verse 7 Bhujyu’s evil-intentioned companions include his father, Tugra,  who left him behind (I.116.3, 119.8). But somehow the Aśvins changed Tugra’s  mind and rescued Bhujyu through Tugra, who, as the description yuvā́ku “seek ing you” implies, was a worshiper of the Aśvins (cf. I.117.14). In verse 8 the poet  refers to the Aśvins’ willingness to come to the rescue even of a “wolf,” of a bad  person, who is “starving” (jásamāna). This applies to Śayu, since he was once
968 VII.68
“starving” (jásuri, I.116.22), but the Aśvins rescued him by making his sterile  cow give milk.
In the final verse (vs. 9), which is reminiscent of the first verse of the previous  hymn, the poet alludes to the cow that the Aśvins swell in verse 8. Geldner under stands the cow to represent the gifts that the poet receives from the sacrificer, but  more likely it is the poem itself, which will yield good things for the poet. Note that  the poem is the focus of 9ab, which refers to “good hymns” and “good thoughts.”  The verb jarate, translated here as “awakens,” can also mean “sings,” and the hymn’s  audience would surely have been aware of the double sense.
### 1
Beautiful Aśvins, wondrous ones, journey here with your good horses,  enjoying the songs of him seeking you
and the oblations brought before you. Pursue our (offerings).
### 2
The exhilarating soma stalks have come forth for you. As is right, come  to pursue my offering
across the calls of the stranger. Hear our (calls).
### 3
O Aśvins, your chariot swift as thought rises forth across the airy spaces,  bringing hundredfold help,
speeding to us, o you who bring Sūryā as goods.
### 4
When this stone—seeking the gods, pressing the soma—speaks aloft to  you two,
the inspired poet should turn you enchanting ones here by the
oblations.
### 5
Since you now have brilliant sustenance (for him), you two keep away the  intense (heat) for Atri,
who will receive relief from you, since he is dear to you.
### 6
And again, Aśvins, this is your recompense to Cyavāna, the giver of  offerings, who was growing old:
that you two lay an ageless appearance on (him).
### 7
And again, Aśvins, his companions of evil intent abandoned this Bhujyu  in the middle of the sea.
His enemy [=Tugra], who seeks you, will rescue him.
### 8
Do as you are able, even on behalf of a wolf that is worn out, and listen  to Śayu as you are called—
you who have swelled the fertile cow like waters—even the barren cow— by your able power, Aśvins, by your abilities.
### 9
This praise-poet here awakens with good hymns, rousing himself at the  beginning of the dawns, bringing good thoughts.
The fertile cow makes him grow strong with her refreshing drink, with  her milk. – Do you protect us always with your blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
8 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn is dominated by the chariot of the Aśvins and the theme of the journey  of the Aśvins. The poet opens with the chariot (rátha) and refers to it, often explic itly, in every verse. In verse 1 the poet describes their “golden chariot,” whose bril liance reflects the morning light that accompanies its advent. The final pāda of the  verse takes an interesting turn. The chariot is first called voḷhár “conveyor,” a term  that ordinarily refers to the chariot driver (as in I.144.3d, VI.64.3d, VII.2.35c) or  the horse that pulls a chariot (IX.81.2b, 96.15d, 112.4a). But here and in the simi lar pāda VII.71.4a, it describes the chariot itself, attributing agency to it. But then  the poet also calls—or appears to call—the chariot nŕ̥pati “lord of men,” which  should describe the Aśvins themselves, as it does in VII.71.4. Geldner suggests that  it could be a luptopamā, a comparison in which the particle of comparison has been  omitted: “(wie) ein Fürst.” Renou (EVP XVI: 48) describes the figure as a sort of  hypallage caused by the juxtaposition rátho nr̥patī in VII.71.4. Renou is likely right  that the pāda responds to VII.71.4, but it rather appears to be a semantic expansion  of the chariot so that it includes or rather becomes the horses that pull it and the  drivers who direct it. Also in verse 3 the chariot again takes the role of a groom,  “clasping the bride,” who is being carried on the chariot to her marriage. Behind  this semantic expansion of the chariot, if that is what is occurring, may be the  image of the Aśvins’ chariot as the sacrifice itself. Note that the chariot is described  as “having tracks of ghee” (vs. 1c) and “three chariot-boxes” (vs. 2b), corresponding  to the three soma-pressings. The chariot is not just the sacrifice, however. As usual,  it remains the chariot that brings the Aśvins to the sacrifice, as well as being the  sacrifice, at least in these opening verses.
The theme of the journey of the Aśvins is marked by verbal derivatives of √yā “journey,” which appear in every verse except verses 4 and 7. These two verses refer  to the great deeds of the Aśvins: how they brought the daughter of the Sun to her  marriage, how they rescued Atri from the heat of a pit oven, and how they saved  Bhujyu from the sea. The Aśvins’ chariot and thereby the theme of journeying are  involved in all of these rescues.
### 1
Let your golden chariot, ever pressing upon the two world-halves,  journey here with those bulls, your horses—
the (chariot) with tracks of ghee, gleaming at its wheel-rims, the driver  of refreshments, the lord of men with prizewinning mares.
### 2
Spreading over the five lands, yoked by thought, let it with its three  chariot-boxes journey here—
(the chariot) by which you two go to the clans serving the gods, as you  set your journey toward any direction, Aśvins.
970 VII.70
### 3
You two glorious ones possessing good horses—journey this way. O  wondrous ones, you will drink the honeyed treasure.
Clasping the bride to itself, your chariot presses upon the boundaries of  heaven with its tracks.
### 4
The young woman—the daughter of the Sun—chose your glory at the  decisive turn.
When by your abilities you help him [=Atri], serving the gods, his vital  force evades the heat by your relief.
### 5
O charioteers, this your chariot, which, having been harnessed at the  dawning of the ruddy light, journeys around its course—
by it convey to us luck and life at the breaking of dawn, at this sacrifice,  Aśvins.
### 6
O you two fine men, like two thirsting buffaloes toward lightning,  journey today toward our pressings,
for in many places (people) call upon you two with their thoughts. Let  not the others seeking the gods [=rival sacrificers] hold you down.
### 7
You two brought Bhujyu, struck down into the sea, up from the flood by  your unfailing
winged ones, which neither tire nor falter, when you were rescuing him  by your wondrous powers, Aśvins.

Now, hear my call, youthful ones. Journey the course that brings
refreshment, Aśvins.

7 verses: jagatī
In the last verse the poet calls the attention of the Aśvins to his hymn, calling it  “intricate” or “well-twisted” (suvr̥ktí). He is quite right: his hymn is complex, since  it presents metaphors of unclear reference and ellipses of uncertain interpretation.  Such intricacy is attractive to gods like the Aśvins, and the purpose of the poet is to  get the attention of the Aśvins by means of the hymn and to cause them to take notice  of the offerings and other elements of the sacrifice so that they will be present at it.
In verse 1 the poet summons the Aśvins to take their place at the sacrifice, but  1cd, in which he describes the coming of the Aśvins, can be variously interpreted.  In 1c something “stood” when the Aśvins took their place. We have suggested that  this is the sacrificial fire kindled in the early morning, but other interpreters have  offered other reasonable possibilities: the hot milk offered to the Aśvins (Oldenberg,  Renou [EVP XVI: 49]) or the liquid offerings more generally (Geldner), the vessel for the hot milk (Oldenberg), the “good favor” mentioned in verse 2a (Renou), or  the place itself (Geldner, Velankar [1963]). Of these, the gharma or hot milk offer ing, which is mentioned in 2b, is the strongest possibility, and of course, the sup pression of the subject in 1cd might have allowed hearers to recall several or all of  these things that welcome the Aśvins.
In verse 3 the poet shifts attention to the rewards that the Aśvins will bring. The  sacrificer hopes to find prosperity for the sacrificer from the rivers, plants, and clans,  among which the Aśvins find a place, over which they sit “at the peak of the moun tain”—in heaven perhaps? In verse 4a the “plants and the waters” recall the rivers,  plants, and clans of verse 3 and verbally connect the two verses, even though the  poet again shifts the theme back to the sacrifice being offered to the Aśvins. Here  the waters and plants represent sacrificial libations and offerings. In 4b it is not clear  what are the “harness cords” (yogyā́). They might be rites or offerings (especially  the hot milk offering), or hymns. That is, they are elements of the sacrifice of one  kind or another. Whatever these cords are, the image carries forward the descrip
tion of the Aśvins in 2cd as “well-harnessed” horses and therefore should represent  what attaches the Aśvins to the sacrifice. In 4cd the Aśvins reward the present sacri ficers while keeping in mind the ancient ones. The present sacrifices are the equal to  the ones of the past and therefore deserve the reward of the Aśvins.
In the last verses the poet becomes more straightforward in calling the Aśvins’  attention to his hymn, his “formulations,” which he has sent out in search of them  (vs. 7), and to the sacrifice which stands ready for them (vs. 6).
### 1
Come to us, Aśvins, who grant all desires: this has been proclaimed as  your place on earth.
Having prosperity on its back like a prizewinning horse, it [=the fire?]  stood up when you two sat down here as if (sitting) upon your womb  to remain steadfast.
### 2
The most delightful favor clings to you two. In the house of Manu has  been heated the hot milk
that carries you, having been harnessed like a pair of well-harnessed  swift steeds, across the seas and rivers,
### 3
(Across) the places that you two have taken for yourselves, Aśvins,  among the exuberant (rivers) from heaven, among the plants, and
among the clans—
(you two) sitting down at the peak of the mountain, (you two) bringing  refreshment to the pious man.
### 4
O gods, delight in the plants and waters when you will take on the  harness cords [=the ritual acts?] of our seers.
While granting many treasures to us, you two have kept in view the
ancient generations.

formulations of our seers.

formulations, will become yours, Nāsatyas.
Journey forth to Vasiṣṭha according to his wish. These formulations are  being chanted for you two.

6 verses: triṣṭubh
In its final verse this hymn repeats the last verse of the previous hymn, and as that  verse says, it too is an intricate one (suvr̥ktí). The first verse marks this as an early morning hymn. Since the ruddy light of early dawn is elsewhere associated with the  ruddy cattle, the poet echoes that connection by describing the horses and cattle  that the Aśvins bring. There is also a second possible reading: the two compounds  áśvāmaghā[ḥ] gómaghā[ḥ] “having bounties of horses, bounties of cattle” could  be nominative plurals as well as duals and be taken as proleptic adjectives modify ing the 1st-person “we.” This grammatical ambiguity can imply that the horses and
cattle that the Aśvins bring will become the horses and cattle that we will have. In verses 1–2 the Aśvins are asked also for rescue from enemies, want, and dis ease. In verses 3–4 the poet then turns especially to the chariot of the Aśvins, and, as  often, the chariot is linked to the sacrifice itself. In 3c its horses are “in the harness of  truth,” that is, joined to the hymns and even to the rites, which may also be expres sions of truth. The chariot is also syū́magabhasti, an elusive hapax. Geldner among  others connects gábhasti “hands” to the rays of the sun, but there is no clear instance  of such a use elsewhere in the R̥gveda. We propose, therefore, that the hands, which  normally hold reins, have themselves become the reins (syū́man) of the chariot  because they are the hands of the priests, who control the ritual. In verse 4 the analy sis and reference of viśvápsnya, perhaps “containing all milk,” are obscure. Geldner  wonders whether the word might describe the praise hymn or Agni. The gharma  vessel suggested here is uncertain at best. Verse 5 then returns to the Aśvins’ ability  to save from danger by describing four great acts of rescue. The last, the rescue of  Jāhuṣa, is the least familiar and can be only tentatively reconstructed. The best sug gestion is that of Oldenberg, who says that by combining verse 5d and I.116.20cd we  can get the following: Jāhuṣa was trapped by his enemies is a wild, rocky area, but  the Aśvins brought him out and set him down on light, soft soil. 1. Night recedes from her sister Dawn. The dark leaves behind the path to  the ruddy.
We would call upon you, having bounties of horses, bounties of cattle.  By day and during the night keep the arrow away from us.
### 2
Journey to the pious mortal, conveying what is desirable by your chariot,  Aśvins.
By day and during the night keep thirst and affliction from us, o you rich  in honey. You two should deliver us.
### 3
Let your bulls [=horses], showing us favor, turn your chariot here at the  nearest dawn.
Convey here your (chariot) bearing good things, for which the hands  (of the priests?) are its reins, with its horses in the harness of truth,
Aśvins.
### 4
The chariot that is the conveyor for you, o lords of men, having three  chariot-boxes, bearing good things, journeying at dawn—
by this (chariot) journey here to us, Nāsatyas, when what contains all  milk [=the hot-milk vessel?] goes to you.

You two released Cyavāna from old age. You brought a swift horse  to Pedu.
You recovered Atri from difficulty and darkness. You set Jāhuṣa down  on soft (soil).

5 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn is marked by the repeated invitations to the Aśvins to “journey here”  (ā́...yātam, vss. 1, 2, and 5), which create a ring of the hymn’s beginning and end.  The urgent pleas that the Aśvins come here to this place, to this sacrifice and not to  another, is reinforced by other words meaning “near” or “this way” (arvā́k, 2a) and  “here” (áchā, 3d). Only verse 4 counters by opening with ví, here translated “forth,”  but more exactly signifying “away, apart.” This verse shifts the attention to the  spreading light of dawn (pādas a, c), which is matched in pāda d by the spreading  light of the sacrificial fires and in b by the poetic formulations rising from the sing ers. The last verse joins the expansiveness of verse 4 to the invitation to the Aśvins  by describing the four directions in which the Aśvins are present and from which  they can come to the sacrifice at the center.974 VII.73
The four directions and the implicit center in verse 4 are reflected in the “wealth  belonging to the five peoples” (vs. 5c), that is, the wealth belonging to all the Vedic  clans and tribes. This wish also suggests that this hymn is recited on behalf of  one who sees himself, his tribe, or his clan at the center of the Vedic peoples. The  Vasiṣṭha poet is not shy about pointing to his family’s connection to the center  either, since he speaks of the familial formulations that “awaken” in order to bring  the Aśvins (vs. 3ab).
### 1
Journey here, Nāsatyas, by your much gleaming chariot filled with cattle,  filled with horses.
All your teams accompany you, having beautified your bodies with your  eagerly sought glory.
### 2
Journey here near to us by your chariot, Nāsatyas, along with
the gods,
for in you two are our ancestral companionships and common kinship.  Be aware of this!
### 3
The praise songs of the Aśvins have awakened, also our family
formulations and the Dawns, the goddesses.
Seeking to gain these two world-halves, the inspired poet summons here  the two holy Nāsatyas.
### 4
When the dawns break forth, Aśvins, the singers present to you their  formulations.
The god Savitar has fixed the radiant beam on high. The fires awaken  aloft by kindling.
### 5
Journey here from the west or from the east, Nāsatyas, here from the  south or from the north, Aśvins,
here from everywhere with the wealth belonging to the five peoples. – Do  you protect us always with your blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This short hymn is a summons to the Aśvins at the break of dawn, “the further  shore of ...darkness.” In verse 2 the poet calls the Aśvins’ attention to Agni, the  sacrificial fire and the Hotar of the sacrifice, who has been installed and stands  ready to give the offerings to the Aśvins (2ab). All is ready for the Aśvins to con
sume the soma and the other offerings presented to them (2cd). In verse 3a the poet  compares this sacrifice to a chariot speeding to the Aśvins. This image is answered  in verse 4ab, which looks forward to the arrival of the váhnī, the “two chariot horses.” The term can refer to the horses of the Aśvins, but it might also refer to  the Aśvins themselves as chariot-horses (cf. VIII.8.12). But in either case the idea is that the fully prepared sacrifice races to the Aśvins, and the Aśvins, with or as fully  equipped horses, race to the sacrifice. Again, in verse 4cd the poet draws attention  to the ritual preparations made for the Aśvins and begs the Aśvins not to ignore his  call and overlook his sacrifice. The last verse repeats the final verse of the preceding  hymn. Here it is not so closely tied to the themes of the hymn, but it appropriately  continues the plea to the Aśvins to travel from wherever they are to the sacrifice.
### 1
We have crossed to the further shore of this darkness, aiming our praise  song as we seek the gods.
My song calls to those having many wondrous powers, foremost among  many, born in the distant past, to the immortal Aśvins.
### 2
Manu’s own dear Hotar [=Agni] has been set down, he who sacrifices to  the Nāsatyas and extols them.
Eat of the honey [=soma], Aśvins, nearby to us. Bringing pleasing
offerings, I call on you two at the ritual distributions.
### 3
We have sped the sacrifice, choosing among the paths. Take pleasure in  this intricate (hymn), o bulls.
Sent forth like an obedient servant, Vasiṣṭha has been roused for you  two—(he) awakening in response to you with his praise songs.
### 4
These two chariot-horses—demon-smashing, fully equipped, having hard  hooves—will come near our clan.
The exhilarating (soma-)stalks have gathered together. Do not overlook  us! Come with benevolence!
### 5
Journey here from the west or from the east, Nāsatyas, here from the  south or from the north, Aśvins,
here from everywhere with the wealth belonging to the five peoples. – Do  you protect us always with your blessings.

6 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas
The metrical alternation of br̥hatī and satobr̥hatī structures this hymn into three  pragāthas. All three mention food, most often the soma (vss. 2d, 3b) or other nour ishment (vs. 5b) that the Aśvins receive. But the poet also describes the nourishment  that the Aśvins give (vs. 2a). The last two verses connect these two kinds of nourish ment in the climax of the hymn. In verse 5 the poet pairs the nourishment that his  patrons follow as they approach the Aśvins as a complement to the “glory,” their  prominence in the social order, that they receive from the Aśvins in exchange. As a  result these patrons become godlike—able to keep away “the wolf,” which represents  danger (cf. I.174.10 of Indra), and swelling “with swelling strength” (śávasā śūśuvuḥ;  cf. VII.93.2 of Indra and Agni, VI.19.2 of Indra, and I.167.9 of the Maruts). The
976 VII.75
ability of the Aśvins to go to every clan (vs. 1d) likewise parallels the “man-protec tors” (nr̥pātā́raḥ), or kings of the peoples, of the tribes consisting of clans.
### 1
Now the rituals of the day call upon you two, Aśvins, (at the dawning) of  reddening dawn.
Now have I called upon you for help, o you whose goods are powers,  since you go to every clan.
### 2
You two have given brilliant sustenance, o you fine men. Hurry it to the  liberal-minded one.
You of one mind—stop your chariot nearby. Drink the soma-honey!
### 3
Journey here! Attend to us here! Drink of the honey, Aśvins!
The milk has been milked out, o bulls whose goods are worth winning.  Do not overlook us! Come here!
### 4
Your horses that fly to the home of the pious one, bringing you two— by these swift steeds journey here, o men, Aśvins, seeking us, o gods.
### 5
And then our patrons, going to the Aśvins, follow the nourishments. These two Nāsatyas will offer enduring glory to the generous ones and  protection to us.
### 6
The man-protectors of the peoples, keeping the wolf away, who like  chariots have journeyed forth—
these men swell with their own swelling strength, and they dwell upon a  good dwelling.
This group of seven Dawn hymns, VII.75–81, is the largest such collection devoted  to this goddess in the R̥gveda, though none of the hymns is very long (ranging from  eight verses to three). The hymns share and recycle much of the same vocabulary and  phraseology, and there are striking phonologically driven lexical responsions across  hymns, which can unfortunately not be rendered in translation. What distinguishes  the hymns from each other is their structure, which can be quite tightly organized  and reinforced by verbal and grammatical markers. See, for example, VII.76.

75 (591) Dawn
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
8 verses: triṣṭubh
This Dawn hymn contains most of the usual Dawn themes: her immediate arrival,  which awakens the world, her beauty and brightness, her daily journey, and, espe cially, her bestowal of riches on her praisers. The second half of verse 7 alludes to  the Vala myth and the release of the dawn cows (see also the Aṅgiras reference in  1d); otherwise there are no mythological elements and no mention of other gods. Although there are no particularly vivid images or striking phrases, the hymn is  pleasingly composed and contains some well-crafted phonological figures that are  unfortunately untranslatable.
### 1
Dawn, born in heaven, has dawned widely with her truth; revealing her  own greatness, she has come here.
She has uncovered the deceits, the disagreeable darkness; best of the  Aṅgirases, she has awakened the paths.
### 2
For our great good faring take note of us today; o Dawn, for our great  good fortune provide (for us).
Establish for us bright, glorious wealth that seeks fame—o goddess  among mortals, belonging to the sons of Manu.
### 3
These are the very beams of Dawn, who is lovely to see, the bright  immortal beams that have come here.
Generating the heavenly commandments, filling the midspaces, they have  spread out.
### 4
This is the very one who, hitching herself up out of the distance, circles  around the five settlements in a single day,
looking upon the patterns of the peoples—the Daughter of Heaven,  mistress of the world.
### 5
Possessed of prize mares, the maiden of the Sun who brings bright  bounties has dominion over wealth, over goods.
Praised by seers, awakening (the world), bounteous Dawn dawns, being  hymned by the conveyors (of songs/oblations).
### 6
The ruddy, bright horses have become visible opposite, conveying the  flashing Dawn.
She drives, the resplendent one, with a chariot entirely ornamented; she  establishes treasure for the person who distributes it.
### 7
True along with the true ones, great with the great, goddess with the  gods, worshipful with the worshipful—
she broke the fastnesses, she will give of the dawn-red (cows): the cows  keep bellowing in response to Dawn.
### 8
Now, o Dawn, establish for us a treasure consisting of cows, of heroes,  and of horses, providing much nourishment to us.
Do not put our ritual grass to scorn among men. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.

76 (592) Dawn
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
A tightly structured hymn: the verbally responsive verses 3–4 are set within an inner  ring (vss. 2, 5) with exact repetition in their final pādas (ámardhanto vásubhiḥ...). This
978 VII.76
structure is reinforced by tense usage: the verbs in verses 1–2 are all augmented aor ists referring to the immediate past of today’s dawn; those in verses 5–7 are present  indicatives and imperatives, stating general truths about the behavior of the dawns  and the singers; while those in verses 3–4 are augmented imperfects (with one per
fect) referring to the distant past, which gave rise to the present situation. This structure defines verses 3–4 as an omphalos, and indeed these verses show  clear omphalos features. Verse 3 contains the most intricate syntax in the hymn,  while verse 4 concerns the Father’s finding of “the hidden light” in the Vala cave,  the primeval model for each new dawn. Verses 3 and 4 are in reverse chronologi cal order: the Fathers find the hidden light of Dawn in verse 4, and verse 3 then  describes the subsequent time with the periodic return of the Dawn, eagerly pro ceeding to the sacrifice as if to a lover, not moving slowly and reluctantly like a  maiden leaving an assignation.
The exact repetition in the inner ring mentioned above is not a static feature. It  participates in what we have termed “poetic repair” (Jamison 2006) and therefore  provides forward movement by setting up a puzzle that is resolved later in the hymn.  The adjective ámardhantaḥ “not negligent” modifies “paths” in verse 2. The com
bination seems discordant, although the hearer can construct a meaningful read ing: paths that are not negligent are those, properly maintained and “set in order,”  that lead one where they are supposed to go. The application of “not negligent” to  the priests in verse 5 is far easier to interpret: not negligent priests are those who  properly perform the sacrifice every morning and therefore do not transgress the  gods’ commandments that regulate the proper functioning of the cosmos, since  by ritual logic the sacrifice causes the new day to dawn. The phrase in verse 5 thus  “repairs” the more jarring one in verse 2, but the jarring phrase in verse 2 also  forced the hearers to formulate a more complex conception.
As so often, consideration of poetic structure gives depth to the apparently  conventional expressions and images in this hymn, which recur in so many other  descriptions of Dawn.
### 1
The immortal light belonging to all people—he who belongs to all men,  god Savitar, has propped that up.
In accordance with his will, the eye of the gods has been born. Dawn has  revealed the whole world.
### 2
The paths leading to the gods have become visible to me—paths that are  not negligent and are set in order by the good ones.
The beacon of Dawn has appeared from the east. She has come here,  facing west from her habitation.
### 3
Those were the days: the many days through which, at the rising of  the sun,
you became visible, o Dawn—faring forth thence toward the east-facing  (sacrifice), like (a maiden) faring forth to her lover, not like one going  (home) again. 4. Those were the feasting companions of the gods: the sage poets of old,  provided with truth.
The Fathers discovered the hidden light. With their mantras that come  true, they generated the Dawn.
### 5
Come together in a common pen, they [=priests] act in unison; they do  not marshal themselves in opposition.
They do not transgress the commandments of the gods, they who are  not negligent and are united with the good ones.
### 6
In response to you the Vasiṣṭhas reverently invoke you with praises,  when, waking at dawn, they have praised you, well-portioned one.
Leader of cows, mistress of prizes, dawn for us, o well-born Dawn. Be  first awake.
### 7
She is the leader of largesse, of liberalities. Dawn, while dawning, is  “squawked” to by the Vasiṣṭhas,
as she establishes wealth of long fame in us. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.

77 (593) Dawn
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
Renou (EVP III: 95) calls this hymn a “pièce banale,” a designation that seems  hardly fair. Although it lacks the intricate patterning of the immediately pre ceding hymn, its simpler structure gives it a forward-moving urgency encoded  in its deployment of verb forms. The first half of the hymn (vss. 1–3) opens  with a perfect (ruruce “she has shone”) but thereafter consists entirely of aug mented aorists (like vss. 1–2 of VII.76), with aroci of 2d almost forming a  ring with the opening perfect form, built to the same root (√ruc). There is an  abrupt change of verbal mood in verse 4, with a cascade of imperatives in the  next two verses (4–5). The grammatical person also changes: the constant 3rd  person of verses 1–3 is succeeded by 2nd person in the rest of the hymn. Thus  the first half of the hymn describes the immediate arrival of Dawn, and in  the second the poet addresses a series of eager commands to Dawn, who has  just appeared in front of him. Two features tie the hymn together grammati cally: (1) the abundance of present participles modifying Dawn in both halves,  though more common in the first; and (2) the constant use of Dawn as subject.  Except for 1c and the first half of the final verse (6ab) Dawn is always the  grammatical subject. A glance at other Dawn hymns in this series shows that  this uniformity is unusual.
No doubt Renou’s remark concerned the “content” of the hymn, and it is cer tainly true that there are no remarkable images or elaborate conceits. However, the
980 VII.78
familiar depiction of Dawn as a lovely and ardent maiden is pleasing here, as it is  elsewhere.
### 1
She has shone—up close like a young maiden, impelling every living  thing forth to activity.
(The time) has just come for Agni to be kindled by the sons of Manu.  She has made light, pressing away the dark shades.
### 2
Facing all, she has arisen in full extension; wearing a luminous, gleaming  garment, she has brightened.
Golden in color, a sight lovely to see, mother of cows, leader of days, she  has shone.
### 3
Well-portioned, conveying the eye of the gods, leading the bright horse  lovely to see,
Dawn has just been seen, decorated with (the sun’s) rays, bringing
brilliant bounties, projecting through all (the world).
### 4
Bringing valuable things nearby, dawn the foe into the distance; create  for us broad pastureland and fearlessness.
Keep hatred away; bring goods here; impel largesse for the singer, you  bounteous one.
### 5
Radiate widely to us with your fairest radiances, goddess Dawn,
lengthening our lifetime,
imparting to us both refreshment and largesse in cattle, horses, and
chariots, you who bring all valuables.
### 6
You whom the Vasiṣṭhas strengthen with their thoughts, o Daughter of  Heaven, well-born Dawn,
as that one place in us wealth high and lofty. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.

78 (594) Dawn
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is characterized by two “signature words”: práti “in response to / oppo site” (found in every verse but 4)  and the present participle vibhā́tī “radiating  widely” (vss. 3–5), words regularly found in other Dawn hymns. In fact, there is,  until near the end, little novel about this hymn. The most noticeable feature until  the end is that the middle verse (3) refers to the dawns in the plural, though they
seem to be immediately present, while the other verses have singular Dawn. But the most noteworthy aspect of the hymn is the striking hapax verb that opens  the last half verse (5c): tilvilāyádhvam. This is a transparent denominative built to  the adjective tílvila (V.62.7), but this only displaces the problem, as the meaning  and derivation of this adjective are not at all clear, and its rhyming reduplicative formation (til-vil) deviates markedly from normal Vedic word formation patterns.  The adjective is generally taken to mean “fruitful’ or the like and may be connected  with the word tilá “sesame.” If so, the creation and abundant scattering of seed may  be the intended meaning here, though this is only a guess. The English idiom used  to translate this obscure word is meant to convey its special status in the diction of  this otherwise unremarkable hymn.
### 1
The first beacons have been seen opposite; her unguents diffuse aloft. Dawn, with your lofty, light-filled chariot turned hither, convey to us a  thing of value.
### 2
In response to her the kindled fire awakens; in response (to her awaken)  the inspired poets hymning (her) with their thoughts.
The goddess Dawn travels, while pressing away all shades of darkness, all  difficulties with her light.
### 3
These very dawns have been seen opposite in the east, extending their  light, radiating widely.
They have generated the sun, the sacrifice, the fire. The disagreeable  darkness has gone back behind.
### 4
She has appeared, the bounteous Daughter of Heaven. All look at Dawn  radiating widely.
She has mounted the chariot being yoked by her own power, which
horses of good yoke convey hither.
### 5
In response to you those of good thought have awakened today—our  bounteous (patrons) and we (ourselves).
Be fruitful and multiply, Dawns, while radiating widely. – Do you protect  us always with your blessings.

This little hymn is dense with phonetic figures and puns, and like the preceding  hymn has signature words—in this case the preverb ví “apart, widely” and the pho nologically similar verbal roots vas “dawn” and vR̥(var) “(un)cover.”
Like many Dawn hymns, this one gives the opening of the Vala cave and the  release of the cows imprisoned therein as the mythic model for each new dawn (see  esp. vs. 4). Dawn’s association with the distribution of goods is also emphasized in  the last three verses.
### 1
Dawn has dawned widely along the path of the peoples, awakening the  five settlements stemming from Manu.
Along with her bulls lovely to see she has propped up her radiance. The  Sun has uncovered the two world-halves with his eye.

They anoint the glossy nights at the ends of heaven; like clans in (battle-) harness the dawns are marshaled.

This very brief hymn, a mere three verses, sketches the main outlines of Dawn’s  activities, though it has no space to elaborate: her connection with poets and the  morning ritual, her task of revealing the visible world and banishing darkness, and  her connection with the distribution of goods.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: brhat ̥ ī alternating with satobrhat ̥ ī, arranged in pragāthas This final hymn breaks the pattern of the other Dawn hymns in this series: it has  too many verses for its position; it is composed of three pragāthas of br̥hatī alter nating with satobr̥hatī (as opposed to the triṣṭubh meter of the other hymns); and  it lacks the Vasiṣṭha clan refrain. It is therefore likely to have been an addition to  the collection, and the 1st-person plural subjunctive bhunájāmahai in verse 5 with  the modernized -mahai ending supports this assumption. However, the themes and  concerns of the hymn and the phraseology employed do not differ significantly  from those that went before.
### 1
She has appeared opposite, as she comes here dawning, the Daughter of  Heaven.
She unwraps the great darkness for seeing; the spirited one creates light. 2. The sun sends the ruddy (cows) surging up all together, as that heavenly  body itself goes up with his rays.
O Dawn, just at your first flush and that of the sun, might we be united  with what is apportioned.
### 3
In response to you, o Dawn, Daughter of Heaven, we lively ones have  awakened—
you who convey much to be coveted, you winner, (who convey) pleasure,  like a treasure, to the pious one.

You who in dawning, through your magnanimity, o great goddess, make  the sun to be visible for seeing—
may we—we beseech you—have a share of your treasure, being to you  like sons to their mother.

Bring here that brilliant bounty, Dawn, that has the longest fame. What of yours provides nourishment to men, o Daughter of Heaven,  give us that. Let us be nourished!

82 (598) Indra and Varuṇa
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: jagatī
This hymn is structured into two sections, with the second embedded in the first.  The first is an invocation to Indra and Varuṇa to come to the rite and consists of  verses 1 and 7–10. The second section and the heart of the hymn are verses 2–6,  which describe the two sides of kingship that the two gods represent.
Indra represents the king ruling during times of migration and conflict; Varuṇa  represents the king ruling during times of settlement, ideally times of peace. In the984 VII.82
political structure of the Vedic period, different men may have been kings during  these two times or, as we believe more likely, the same king may have exercised these  complementary functions at different times of the year.
In verse 2 the poet calls one of the gods samrā́j “sovereign king” and the other  svarā́j “independent king.” While both terms can be used of both Indra and Varuṇa  (cf. Schlerath 1960:  132–35), samrā́j is used especially frequently of Varuṇa and  the Ādityas (cf. I.25.10; V.63.3, 85.1; VIII.25.7–8, 29.9, 42.1; X.63.5) and svarā́j frequently of Indra (cf. I.61.9; III.45.5; VIII.12.14, 46.28, 61.2, 69.17, 93.11).  Therefore, despite Schlerath’s doubts, the “sovereign king” here is likely Varuṇa  and the “independent king” Indra. Further, at least in this verse, the contrasting  titles likely reflect the distribution of kingly functions between the two gods. Since  the samrā́j governed the peoples and their divisions, he might be connected with  times of settlement. Since the svarā́j was independent of other authority, he might  be associated with times of conflict between separate clans, peoples, and rulers.
However the relation between svarā́j and samrā́j is to be understood, the poet  insists on the necessity of both kinds of king and both sides of kingship. Indeed,  after contrasting the two gods in verse 2ab, the poet emphasizes their similarity  (2cd) and their united action in ordering the world (3ab). In verse 3cd the actions of  the ritual are blended with the gods’ cosmic functions. The two gods share Soma— here both the ritual drink and the god—who inspires their action and who therefore  metonymically possesses the transforming power, the “cunning” (māyā́), by which  they made the waters swell. The image of swelling waters is then metaphorically  carried over to the hymns, which should likewise swell.
In verse 4 the poet returns to the two periods associated with the two sides of king ship: in 4a the poet and his people are moving in chariots at the time of conflict and  migration; in 4b they are seated at the beginning of the period of settlement. But here,  unlike verse 2ab, the poet does not explicitly distinguish between the two gods. Both  gods are summoned at both times. In verse 5cd, however, he reintroduces their oppo sition by connecting Varuṇa with settlement and Indra with movement. This alterna tion between conjunctions and disjunctions underscores the mutual dependence of  the different sides of kingship and the poet’s insistence that both gods are great.
Verse 6 continues the contrast between Indra and Varuṇa in a fashion similar to  verse 2, although the actions of the gods in 6cd are not entirely clear. Assuming that  6c refers to the action of Indra and possibly to the destruction of Vr̥tra and similar  “obstacles,” then 6d describes the action of Varuṇa. As Renou (EVP VII: 83) notes,  the verb prá √vR̥in 6d is rare, but appears to mean “ward off” the attack of an enemy  (cf. IX.21.2). Unlike the aggressive action of Indra in 6c, the action of Varuṇa is  thus defensive. Perhaps he protects the individual settlements during times of peace  from incursions from enemies who might threaten them. The two gods thus have  complementary functions in their different contexts and the similarity between  them is reflected in the singular ójas “power” (6b) that both possess.
In verse 1 the poet is especially aware that his is not the most elaborate sacrifice  offered, but he asks the gods to ignore what he sees as the overly showy rites of his competitors and to come to his rite. While it may be plainer than other rites, it does  not have the evil intent behind it that those rites have. Returning to this theme in  the latter part of the hymn, verses 7–10, the poet pleads for the attention of Indra  and Varuṇa. In verse 9 he recalls the competition for the gods’ favor and again asks  the gods to hear his words, for his sacrifice will please the gods more than the words  and rites of others.
### 1
O Indra and Varuṇa, extend great protection to our rite, to our clan and  people.
In the contests might we conquer the one whose fore-offerings are long,  who is overzealous—those of vile intent!
### 2
One of you two is called a sovereign king [=Varuṇa]; the other an  independent king [=Indra]. Indra and Varuṇa are both great, both
bearers of great goods.
All the gods in the furthest heaven have united power and strength in  you two, o bulls.
### 3
You two drilled holes for the waters by your power, and you two raised  the preeminent sun in heaven.
O Indra and Varuṇa, in the exhilaration of cunning (Soma) you made  the depleted (waters) swell. Make our insights swell!
### 4
As chariot-drivers we call upon just you in conflicts and battles; (seated)  with knees fixed, we call upon you at your instigation of peaceful
settlement;
we singers call upon you, easy to call, the masters of the good belonging  to both (war and peace), o Indra and Varuṇa.
### 5
O Indra and Varuṇa, since you two created all these beings of the living  world by your greatness,
with peaceful settlement Mitra befriends Varuṇa; with the Maruts the  other, powerful one [=Indra] speeds toward beauty.
### 6
For the sake of (displaying) the great exchange-gift (of Indra?) and the  vibrant might of Varuṇa, the two show the measure of enduring
power belonging to him [=to each one], which is his own:
the one [=Indra] overcomes the piercing (enemy) [=Vr̥tra?], who is no  kin; with a few the other [=Varuṇa] wards off the greater.

Narrow straits do not (come) upon the mortal, nor do difficulties, nor  does burning heat from anywhere, o Indra and Varuṇa,
to whose rite you two come, o gods, (whose rite) you two pursue, nor  does a mortal’s crookedness reach him.
### 8
Come near with your divine help, o you fine men! Listen to (this) call, if  you will find pleasure in my (call).
Because there is companionship with you two or since there is friendship,  extend compassion (to us), o Indra and Varuṇa.

For us, o Indra and Varuṇa, be our vanguard in every contest, o you  who have power over the peoples,

Let Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman extend to us their brilliance,  their great, widespread protection,

83 (599) Indra and Varuṇa
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: jagatī
This hymn looks back at the Battle of the Ten Kings described in VII.18, in which  the Bharata king Sudās with the help of the Vasiṣṭhas triumphed over an alliance  of ten rulers. This battle was a key moment in Vasiṣṭha history, and the poet recalls  this historic victory in order to extend it into the present. Now warriors allied with  the Vasiṣṭhas are going forth in their quest for cattle (vs. 1). Looking on Indra and  Varuṇa, who are present at the sacrifice, with their minds if not with their eyes and  thinking of their close association with the two gods, the poet and his allies call  upon the gods to help them. The cry to help Sudās in 1d replicates the call to which  the gods responded before and sets the stage for the poet’s recollection of the Ten  Kings’ battle.
In verse 3 the poet re-enters the earlier battle and speaks as if he were part of it  or speaks in the voice of those who were. In the person of the earlier Vasiṣṭha, he  calls for help in the midst of the turmoil of battle. Then in verse 4ab he remembers  that the gods did help Sudās, and in 4cd the poet returns to his present, calling on  Indra and Varuṇa to hear him. Like the earlier Vasiṣṭha, the poet and his people  confront enemies on every side (vs. 5ab), and therefore he calls upon Indra and  Varuṇa to help at the critical time as they did before (5cd). The poet knows that  others summon the gods as well (vs. 6ab), but in verses 6cd–8 he recalls that the  gods chose to help Sudās and Vasiṣṭha and not the other kings and priests. In the  end the sacrifices of these others were inadequate, and in the end the gods were  present at the sacrifice of Vasiṣṭha (vss. 7–8). In verse 9 the poet distinguishes Indra  and Varuṇa for the first and only time in this hymn. While the two gods may have  different functions, both their divine functions apply to the poet’s present situation.  Indra can bring victory to the poet and his people and Varuṇa can defend them.
### 1
Looking upon you two and their friendship (with you), o you superior  men, the broad-chested ones have gone forward in their quest for
cattle. Strike down the obstacles, both Dāsa and Ārya! Help Sudās with your  help, Indra and Varuṇa!
### 2
Where superior men gather together with their banners set, in a contest  where there is nothing at all to love,
where living beings, seeing the sun, become afraid, there speak for us,  Indra and Varuṇa!
### 3
“The ends of the earth have appeared covered in dust! O Indra and  Varuṇa, the tumult has mounted to heaven!
The tribes’ hostilities have come upon me: o you hearing my call, come  near with help.”
### 4
Indra and Varuṇa, conquering Bheda without opposition with your  deadly weapons, you helped Sudās.
Hear the sacred formulations to summon you! The placement of the  Tr̥tsus [=the Vasiṣṭhas] in front came to be their true (place).
### 5
Indra and Varuṇa, the evils of the stranger and the hostilities of the  aggressive ones burn against me.
Because you two are kings of the good belonging to both (war and
peace?), so once more help us on the decisive day.
### 6
Both (sides) call upon you two in the contests, upon Indra and upon  Varuṇa, to win what is good,
(as) when you helped Sudās together with the Tr̥tsus, when he was hard  pressed by the ten kings.
### 7
Gathered together but without a zeal to sacrifice, the ten kings gave no  fight to Sudās, o Indra and Varuṇa.
The invitatory praise of the superior men [=priests] sitting down to the  [sacrificial] meal came true: at the call of these to the gods, the gods  became present.
### 8
Indra and Varuṇa, you did your best for Sudās, surrounded on every  side in the battle with the ten kings,
when they, the bright-faced ones with braided hair, through their
reverence—the insightful Tr̥tsus through their insight—offered their  service.
### 9
The one [=Indra] smashes obstacles in battles; the other [=Varuṇa] ever  guards his commandments.
We summon you two, you bulls, with our intricate hymns. Extend your  protection to us, Indra and Varuṇa.
### 10
Let Indra, Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman extend to us their brilliance,  their great, widespread protection,
and the unassailable light of Aditi—they who grow strong through the  truth. We will keep in mind the signal call of the god Savitar.

84 (600) Indra and Varuṇa
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The theme of rapid and forward movement dominates this hymn. This movement  is marked by the repetition of prá “forth” or “forward” in verses 1c, 3d, 4c, and 5b  and by verbal forms such as invati “speeds” in 2a and -jūtaḥ “hastened” in 3c. The  various kinds of movement involve the proffering of hymns and oblations and the  answering progress of the sacrificers by means of the wealth and offspring they  receive from the gods. There is also movement implied in the “speed” of the rule of  Indra and Varuṇa (2a), which extends high and wide. In verse 2, verbally enclosed  within this description of the extent of their rule (2a, 2d), are the “bonds” of the  two gods (2b) and the anger of Varuṇa (2c), which show the menacing power of the  gods to enforce their rule.
Another characteristic of this hymn is verbal sleight of hand in verses 1 and 4. In  verse 1 the “ghee-rich one” (ghr̥tā́cī) would normally described the sacrificial ladle,  but, as Renou (EVP VII: 85) notes, it can also characterize the dhī́, the “insight”  embodied in the hymn (I.2.7) or the “songs” (gíraḥ, VII.5.5). Because this “ghee-rich  one” is held in the arms of the priests, hearers would think first of the ladle. But  in 1d the “ghee-rich one” goes “by itself” and “in its varying appearance.” These  descriptions would fit the hymn, which flies to the gods with its varied sounds and  words. The final line, therefore, creates for hearers an unexpected redefinition of the  “ghee-rich one” and produces a double image of it as both ladle and hymn. As such,  the “ghee-rich one” represents the “oblations and reverence” offered to the gods in 1b.
Neither the translation nor the interpretation of verse 4cd is secure. The rela tive clause in 4c surely describes Varuṇa, but śū́ra “champion” in 4d is more  likely a description of Indra. So the normal relation between relative and main  clauses suggests that the subject in 4d is Varuṇa (as Sāyaṇa understands it to be),  but the content of 4d suggests that it is Indra. Moreover, there is a word play  between minā́ti “confounds,” which ends 4c, and ámitā “immeasurable,” which  opens 4d. They are not from the same root, although they sound as though they  could be. The words thus create a verbal icon of simultaneous similarity and dif ference. These ambiguities accord with the representation of Varuṇa and Indra  as embodying different sides of kingship, which are nonetheless complementary  and necessary to one other. As we read the lines, therefore, the two gods are  separately characterized, but their separation is undermined by formal features  that efface it.
### 1
I would turn you two here to our rite with oblations and reverence, o  kings Indra and Varuṇa.
The ghee-rich one [=the ladle/hymn] (goes) forth to you two, being
held (forth) in our arms. By itself it goes all around in its varying
appearance. 2. Heaven speeds the lofty rule of you two, who bind with ropeless bonds. Might the anger of Varuṇa avoid us. Indra will make a wide, wide world  for us.
### 3
Make our sacrifice cherished at the ritual distributions; make our sacred  formulations acclaimed among patrons.
Let wealth, hastened by the gods, come to us. Further us with the help  we crave.
### 4
On us, o Indra and Varuṇa, bestow wealth granting every wish, rich in  goods and many cattle.
If the Āditya [=Varuṇa] confounds untruths, the champion [=Indra]  apportions immeasurable goods.
### 5
This song of mine has reached Indra and Varuṇa. It helped (us) forward,  multiplying us in kith and kin.
Having good treasure, we would go in pursuit of the gods. – Do you  protect us always with your blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The poet announces his hymn in the first verse, implicitly comparing it to Agni,  the sacrificial fire. Agni has a “face of ghee,” that is, he is both bright like ghee and  receives oblations of ghee (cf. I.143.7, III.1.18, V.11.1, X.21.7). This prepares for  verse 4, in which the poet asks that Agni be the Hotar of this rite, who will bring  the oblations to Indra and Varuṇa. The last verse is also found as VII.84.5 but is less  thematically connected to this hymn than it is to the previous hymn.
### 1
While offering soma to Indra and Varuṇa, I will purify for you two an  inspired thought free from anything demonic
and with a face of ghee like the goddess Dawn. Let those two give us  wide space at the moment of encounter on our journey.
### 2
Surely they contest with one another here in summoning the gods, where  missiles fly amid the banners.
O Indra and Varuṇa, with your arrow strike those enemies, that they be  far away and dispersed.
### 3
Since even the waters of innate glory, goddesses (themselves) have set  Indra and Varuṇa in their seats among the gods,
the one [=Varuṇa] holds fast the agitated peoples; the other [=Indra]  smashes the unopposable obstacles.
### 4
Let him [=Agni] of strong resolve, perceiving the truth, be our Hotar— the one who bringing homage (turns) you two (here) by his power, o  Āditya.
990 VII.86
Bringing oblations, he will turn you two here to help. Bringing pleasure  (to you), he will indeed be the one present for our safe passage.

86 (602) Varuṇa
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
8 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn and the following three hymns (VII.87–89) are justly famous because  they have an unusually intimate tone and because the poet Vasiṣṭha as a literary  creation of the poem emerges as a distinct personality. Jamison (2007:  91–118)  offers a detailed study of the hymns in this group and of the creation of the poet’s  personality. Like the other hymns in this small collection, this poem centers on just  two figures, the poet—Vasiṣṭha according to tradition—and the god Varuṇa, and  Vasiṣṭha speaks personally, even confessionally with Varuṇa. Apparently Vasiṣṭha  has been suffering from some kind of affliction, which, he has been told, is the pun ishment of King Varuṇa for an offense. He begs Varuṇa to accept his offerings and  repentance, to forgive his transgressions, which he says were not intentional (vs. 6),  and to restore him to prosperity and health.
The relationship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa constantly shifts as the hymn  unfolds. The literary strategy of the poem most clearly appears in its use of pro nouns and other markers of person, as Jamison (2007: 96–100) shows in her analysis.  Use of the 3rd person distances the speaker and the object, while addressing another  as “you” is a token of closeness and presence to one another. The poet deploys these  pronouns first to distance Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, then to bring them close, and finally  to separate them once again. So in verse 1 Vasiṣṭha is absent because there is no  reference to the speaker, and Varuṇa is distanced by the 3rd singular pronoun asya.  His absence is mitigated only by fact that unaccented asya should be anaphoric and  therefore might point to the previous presence of the god. Otherwise, the relation
ship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa is completely broken. In verse 2 Vasiṣṭha is present  (1st sg. in each of the four lines), and Varuṇa remains distanced. In verse 3 Vasiṣṭha  is present once again (1st sg.) and Varuṇa is partly present: he is addressed in the  vocative but he is also mentioned in the 3rd person. In verse 4 both Vasiṣṭha (1st sg.)  and Varuṇa (2nd sg.) are present. Then there begins a retreat from their full presence  to one another. In verse 5 Vasiṣṭha is less present (the 1st pl. generalizes rather than  personalizes the speaker) and Varuṇa is present (through the vocative address and  2nd sg. imperative). This verse reverses 3, in which Vasiṣṭha was fully present but  Varuṇa partly present. In verse 6 Vasiṣṭha is distanced (note especially svá “one’s  own,” not “my own”), and Varuṇa is present (through the vocative address). Again this verse reverses 2, in which Vasiṣṭha was present and Varuṇa was distanced. In  verse 7 Vasiṣṭha is present (1st sg.), but Varuṇa is distanced (3rd sg.). This partially  reverses 1 insofar as Vasiṣṭha was absent there but is present here. Varuṇa remains  distanced in both verses 1 and 7. The last verse (8), is a concluding, extra-hymnic  verse, a coda that stands outside the main structure of the hymn.
This analysis also shows the omphalos structure of the hymn. Verse 1 corresponds  to 7, verse 2 to 6, verse 3 to 5, and verse 4 is the center. It is the thematic heart of the  hymn because it is in this verse that the poet and the god are both present and pres ent to one another. It also signifies the determination of Vasiṣṭha, who anticipates  the resolution of his conflict with Varuṇa. Varuṇa will—perhaps even in the sense of  “must”—proclaim what Vasiṣṭha has done, and Vasiṣṭha promises to make amends  to the god to receive the god’s forgiveness. Although the hymn moves away from this  encounter between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, the last verse suggests that the problem has  been resolved. Varuṇa has returned to the distance, but he and Vasiṣṭha now mutually  support one another. Varuṇa has enlightened Vasiṣṭha (vs. 7c), and Vasiṣṭha ritually  serves the god to his greater “wealth,” his power and glory (7d).
In verse 2b the meaning of váruṇe “within Varuṇa” may play on the possible ety mological relation of váruṇa and vratá “commandment.” That is, “within Varuṇa”  has the sense of “under, or in conformity with, the commandment of Varuṇa.”  The poet wants to be no longer at odds with Varuṇa. At the same time the hope  for closeness to the god or even for envelopment by the god, which is suggested in  the phrase, looks forward to the increasing intimacy of Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa. The  state is both parallel to and contrasts with the situation in verse 6c where the elder  is “within the misdeed of the younger.”
In verse 4d, we read áva...īyām, from ava + √yā “make recompense,” instead of  the transmitted but metrically faulty áva...iyām.
### 1
Insightful are the races (of gods and mortals) through the greatness of  him who propped apart the two wide world-halves.
He pushed forth the vault of heaven to be high and lofty, (also) the star  [=the sun] once again, and he spread out the earth.
### 2
And together with my own self, I speak this: “When shall I be within  Varuṇa?
Might he take pleasure in my offering, becoming free of anger? When  shall I, with good thoughts, look upon his mercy?”
### 3
I ask myself about this guilt, o Varuṇa, wanting to see; I approach those  who understand in order to inquire.
Even the sage poets say the very same thing to me: “Varuṇa now is angry  with you.”
### 4
Was the offense so very great, Varuṇa, that you wish to smash a praise  singer and companion?
You will declare this to me, o you hard to deceive, o you of independent  will! With reverence I would swiftly *make recompense to you (to be)  freed of guilt.
992 VII.87
### 5
Release from us ancestral deceits and those that we ourselves have  committed.
O king, release Vasiṣṭha from his bond like a cattle-stealing thief, like  a calf.
### 6
This was not one’s own devising nor was it deception, o Varuṇa, (but  rather) liquor, frenzy, dice, thoughtlessness.
The elder exists within the misdeed of the younger. Not even sleep wards  off untruth.
### 7
Like a servant, I will give satisfaction to the generous (master); freed  from offense, I (will give satisfaction) to the ardent one.
The civilizing god [=Varuṇa] made those without understanding to
understand; the better sage poet [=Vasiṣṭha] speeds his clever (patron)  [=Varuṇa] to riches.
### 8
This praise song is for you, Varuṇa, you who are of independent will: let  it be set within your heart.
Let there be good fortune in peaceful settlement for us and let there
be good fortune in war for us. – Do you protect us always with your  blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
On this hymn, see the introduction to the previous hymn and especially Jamison  (2007: 101–3).
The name of Varuṇa occurs in each verse of the hymn, and in verse 4 Varuṇa  himself speaks. Like the previous one, therefore, this hymn has an omphalos  structure, organized around the central verse 4 and the words of the god himself.  In hymns organized around a central verse, that verse is often the key to under
standing a hymn or the dramatic climax of the hymn, as it is, for example, in the  previous hymn. But sometimes, as here, it is the most enigmatic verse of all. In 4a,  as implied in the translation below, does Varuṇa know that the poet is wise and  therefore will understand his cryptic words? Or does médhira “wise” anticipate  the wisdom that the poet will receive from Varuṇa’s words? In that case, we might  rather say that Varuṇa spoke “to me (to make me) wise”? As Jamison (2007: 102– 3) argues, the ambiguous placement of ná in 4c allows it to be taken either as a  particle of comparison (“like”) or as a negation (“not”). As a result the pāda  can mean either “he will speak (their names) like secrets,” that is, he will speak  the names but he will do so only in a cryptic manner, or “he will not speak their  secret (names),” that is, he will keep the secrets hidden. But most of all, there are  the obscure words of the god in 4b: “The inviolable cow bears three times seven names.” As often, the “cow” in this verse is speech (e.g., Thompson 1995: 20),  and it is speech, or more specifically this hymn, that carries within it twenty-one  “names.” These names may be similar to the three times seven “tracks” (padā́) in  I.72.6, although these tracks too are also “secret” (gúhyāni) and therefore their  reference unclear.
There is one possible clue to the twenty-one names in the following verse. Verse  5 mentions three heavens and three earths “arranged in six” or “arranged in sixes.”  That is, “six” could refer to the three heavens and three earths, and, if so, we should  translate, “Three heavens are hidden within him, and below are three earths, form
ing an arrangement of six.” On the other hand, if ṣáḍvidhānāḥ refers only to the  three earths and if each of the three earths is arranged in six, then we would have  eighteen earths and three heavens, which gives twenty-one, the number of “names.”  In that case, the “names” might be tokens of the extent of Varuṇa’s rule.
Returning again to verse 4, its last mystery is the “later generation” in 4d,  which may refer not to a future generation of human beings but to humans as the  “generation” of beings later than the gods. If so, then Varuṇa strives to instruct  humans despite their limited capacities, perhaps well illustrated in our attempts to  understand him.
While verse 4 is the most enigmatic in the hymn, it is not the only mysterious  one. We have already touched on the riddle of three heavens and three earths of  verse 5ab. In verse 6a Varuṇa is like the sky, which drops to the horizon at the far  distance where there is the river that surrounds the earth. Because he is like the sky  that drops toward this river, he is called a wild animal (6b) that comes down to the  water to drink and he is like the “bright drop,” which, as Geldner points out, might  be the setting moon or sun or even the soma as it sinks into the waters with which  it is mixed. In 6c Varuṇa is “of deep recitation.” The primary sense is probably that  Varuṇa speaks profound words, but the compound is ambiguous and could also  mean that Varuṇa inspires or receives profound praise-recitations. Verse 7 connects  this hymn to the previous hymn and provides a persuasive reason to link the two  hymns, as Jamison (2007: 103) has noted. In VII.86.2 the poet asks, “When shall  I be within Varuṇa?” Here in verse 7 the poet gives an answer: when we are free of  offense, then “we would be within Varuṇa.” That is, we would be in conformity with  the vratā́ny áditeḥ “the commandments of Aditi,” the goddess representing offense lessness, whose commandments are mentioned in 7c.
### 1
Varuṇa dug the paths for the sun. Forward (went) the floods of rivers to  the sea,
(those) mares, like a surge sent surging, following the truth. He made  great streambeds for the days.
### 2
Your breath, the wind, roars again and again through airy space, like an  ardent animal [=stallion], victorious in its pasture.
(Here are) all your own domains, Varuṇa, between these two great and  lofty world-halves.994 VII.88
### 3
With united desire the spies of Varuṇa survey both well-supported  world-halves,
(as do) the sage poets, possessing the truth and insightful in the
sacrifices, the discerning ones who send their thought.
### 4
Varuṇa said to me who am wise: “The inviolable cow bears three times  seven names.”
Knowing of its track, he will speak (its names) like secrets—he, the
inspired poet who strives on behalf of the later generation.
### 5
Three heavens are hidden within him, and below are three earths,  arranged in sixes.
The clever King Varuṇa created this, the golden swing in heaven [=the  sun], for the sake of beauty.
### 6
Like heaven, Varuṇa has descended to the river—he, the powerful wild  animal, like the bright drop;
he of deep recitation, who takes the measure of the airy space; he the  king of what is, whose lordship offers good passage.
### 7
Might we be without offense within Varuṇa, who will have mercy even on  him who has committed an offense,
as we obediently fulfill the commandments of Aditi. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.

88 (604) Varuṇa
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
This intricate and justly admired hymn has been widely anthologized and stud ied. See especially the treatment of the hymn in Jamison (2007: 103–8) and Lüders  (1951: 315–21). It is closely related to the two preceding hymns and likewise con cerns the relationship between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa, delineating it in perhaps the  most intimate fashion of any of these hymns.
Vasiṣṭha speaks for himself in these verses, even though he begins in verse 1 by  addressing himself in the vocative. Once again, the theme of the poem is the distance  between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa that has been created by something that Vasiṣṭha has  done. That Vasiṣṭha addresses himself in the 2nd person perhaps suggests not only  his distance from the god but even, as a result, from himself. The meaning of this  becomes clearer as the poem develops. In verse 2 Vasiṣṭha approaches the ritual fire  during the night and in the face of fire sees the face of Varuṇa. This results in a  vision of Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa sailing together (vs. 3). Their goal is Varuṇa’s “swing,”  which, as in VII.87.5, is probably the sun, which Vasiṣṭha hopes will dispel the dark ness that surrounds him and his relationship with Varuṇa. This vision takes Vasiṣṭha  back to the time when he and Varuṇa were close (vs. 4), when Varuṇa made Vasiṣṭha  a seer (ŕ̥ṣi) and praise singer (stotár). The light imagery is most intense in this verse, for the day Vasiṣṭha became a seer and praise singer was the “brightest day of days.”  This memory of a time of perfect harmony between Vasiṣṭha and Varuṇa is the dra matic and emotional climax of the hymn and not surprisingly occupies the central
verse of the hymn, which like the two previous hymns has an omphalos structure. In verse 5 Vasiṣṭha returns from his vision and memory of better times to the  unhappy present, in which he is no longer in the household of Varuṇa. But in verse  6 he continues to hope that, despite what he has done, the god will not hold his  offenses against him, and will again offer him the protection that he once enjoyed  within the house of Varuṇa. The poet keeps these offenses distant from himself by  talking about the offender in the 3rd person (in 6ab), but then he refers to those  who bear the guilt of those offenses in the 1st person (in 6c). Finally, in verse 7 the  poet more confidently looks to Varuṇa’s forgiveness: he “will release his fetter” of  punishment “from us.” As Jamison (2007: 107) has pointed out, both pādas a and  c have present participles for which there is no grammatically appropriate noun.  Logically they should describe “us”—and that logic is reflected in the translation— but the absence of an explicit reference to us generalizes that happy result and the  possibility of reconciliation with the god.
### 1
Present to generous Varuṇa a carefully preened, much-loved thought, o  Vasiṣṭha,
to him, the lofty bull who brings a thousand rewards—(you, Vasiṣṭha,)  who will make near at hand the one worthy of the sacrifice.
### 2
Now then, when I came into sight of him, I thought the face of Agni to  be that of Varuṇa.
When the sun is in the rock and darkness is master, may he lead me to  see his wondrous form.
### 3
When we two, Varuṇa and (I), will board the boat, when we two will raise  the middle of the sea,
when we two will voyage through the crests of the waters, we will swing  on the swing for beauty.
### 4
Varuṇa placed Vasiṣṭha on the boat. Skillful in his work, he made him a  seer through his great powers.
The inspired poet (made him) a praise singer on that brightest day of  days for so far as the heavens, for so long as the dawns will extend.
### 5
Where have these companionships of ours come to be, when
previously we would have accompanied one another without wolfish  hostility?
O Varuṇa of independent will, I went into your lofty mansion, your  house with its thousand doors.
### 6
Varuṇa, though one be your very own dear friend and your companion,  if he will commit offenses against you,
may we, burdened with guilt, not pay for (the transgression) against you,  you uncanny one. As an inspired poet, ever offer protection to him
praising you.
996 VII.89

Dwelling in enduring peaceful dwellings, (we will win) you—Varuṇa will  release his fetter from us—
(we), winning help from the lap of Aditi. – Do you protect us always  with your blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: gāyatrī 1–4, jagatī 5
As Oldenberg remarks, although this hymn does not break the sequence of verse  numbers and meter, it appears to be an addition to this Varuṇa collection. It is in  another meter, and Vasiṣṭha does not appear by name within it. Moreover, while  the other three hymns of this collection refer to Vasiṣṭha’s unhappy state, this hymn  more explicitly concerns an illness afflicting the speaker. It is an illness so serious  that it could bring the speaker to the mr̥nmáyaṃ gr̥hám “house of clay” (vs. 1), the  earth, in which the dead are buried.
According to both indigenous commentators and contemporary schol ars, the illness especially associated with Varuṇa is dropsy, on which see Zysk  (1985: 59–61). The reference in verse 2 to the speaker as “inflated like a water-skin”  could point to dropsy, as could prasphuránn iva, here translated “seeming to  kick,” if it is interpreted as stumbling or as describing the water-skin as quiver ing. But the evidence is not very firm.
The last verse, which is in a different meter, brings the hymn closer to the preced ing three hymns, since it lays the blame for the speaker’s condition on a violation of  the commandments of Varuṇa, his dhármā “ordinances.”
### 1
O King Varuṇa, let me not go to the house of clay!

90 (606) Vāyu (1–4), Indra and Vāyu (5–7)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The split dedication to Vāyu, then Indra and Vāyu reflects the ritual fact noted  often elsewhere, that the first offerings of soma at the Morning Pressing are made  to Vāyu alone and then to Indra and Vāyu jointly. This ritual purpose is announced  quite clearly in the first verse, and, as often in Vāyu hymns, the invitation is followed  by the god’s journey to the sacrifice. As often also in Vāyu hymns the poet makes  productive use of the ambiguity between Vāyu’s “teams,” his wind-horses (see vs.  3), and ours, the poetic thought we deploy, and in verse 5 the priests and poets actu
ally become the horses that pull the chariot of the two gods.
As befits the early morning setting of the ritual, Dawn is prominent in the hymn  (vss. 3–4), with the latter verse alluding obliquely to the Vala myth associated with  the primal dawn. The distribution of gifts and goods appropriate to the early morn ing ritual is also prominent. In the early verses 2 and 3 there is promise of benefits  for the sacrificer from the gods, a promise that in the last two verses (6–7) is actually  fulfilled by the gifts made by the human patrons of the sacrifice. Indeed the patrons  seem to be partly assimilated to the gods: they have the power to confer not only  goods but sunlight itself (see vs. 6), and they share with the gods the repeated par ticiple īśāná “having dominion over,” said of Vāyu in verse 2, of Indra and Vāyu in  verse 5, and of the patrons in verse 6.
### 1
The clear, honeyed pressed (soma-drinks) have been presented to you two  by the Adhvaryus with desire for heroes.
Drive, Vāyu; travel to our teams [=poetic thoughts]. Drink of the pressed  stalk, to euphoria.
### 2
Whoever has reached out the fore-offering to you who have dominion  (over it), the clear soma for you, Vāyu, drinker of the clear,
you make him acclaimed among mortals: each one born to him is a  prizewinner.
### 3
The one whom these two world-halves begat for wealth, that god will the  goddess, the Holy Place, position for wealth.
Then his own teams accompany Vāyu and the gleaming white
treasure-chamber [=Dawn] exclusively.
### 4
The dawns dawned, day-bright and stainless. (The men) have found  broad light while reflecting.
The fire-priests have opened up the cowpen. The waters have flowed for  them from a distant day.
### 5
Reflecting with thinking that comes true, yoked by their own resolve,  they draw
the hero-bringing chariot of you two, o Indra and Vāyu. Strengthening  nourishments escort (the chariot of you) who have dominion over (them).
998 VII.91
### 6
They who, having dominion over (them), confer their sun(light) upon us,  through cows, horses, and golden goods,
o Indra and Vāyu, those patrons should prevail in battles through their  whole lifetime with steeds and heroes.

## 91 
91 (607) Vāyu (1, 3), Indra and Vāyu (2, 4–7)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The last half of this hymn (vss. 4cd through 7, the last verse being repeated from  VII.90.7) is a straightforward invitation to Indra and Vāyu to journey to the sacri fice, bringing goods to distribute, and to drink the soma. The first half of the hymn  is both more miscellaneous and more obscurely phrased. True, verse 2 also issues  the invitation to the two gods, but it is sandwiched between two verses with which it  seems to have little in common.
Verse 1 is variously interpreted, with its parts variously arranged in translation.  In our interpretation it contains speculation about the prior existence of the gods  and the beginning of ritual activity: the gods who now derive their strength from  men’s sacrifices must have existed before the sacrifice began, the proof being that  these gods created the dawn and the sun for both Vāyu, a god of the midspace, and  for Manu, the first man and first sacrificer, under trying conditions. (A somewhat  similar situation is depicted in VI.49.13, where Viṣṇu measures out the realms for  “hard-pressed Manu,” another cosmogonic deed.) The creation of dawn would in  turn allow the ritual process, the ritual day, to begin—and begin it does with the  offering to Vāyu. Verse 3 is clearly a depiction of the sacrifice, but the referents of the  various phrases are not entirely certain. Although most scholars consider Vāyu the  subject of the first half-verse, on the basis of shared vocabulary we instead consider  it a disguised reference to the soma and its usual accompaniment, cow’s milk. The  soma drops then offer themselves to Vāyu. The first half of verse 4 complements the  concerns in verse 1: in the first verse the time before the creation of the sacrifice by  the gods is the subject of speculation; in 4ab the unbounded continuance of the sac rifice is envisioned, for as long as men have the power to perform it. With these ends  of the sacrifice demarcated, the offering to Indra and Vāyu in the here-and-now can  proceed, and the simple invitation of the rest of the hymn is issued to them.
### 1
Surely the faultless gods, who (now) grow strong through reverence,  existed previously? (Yes, because) for Vāyu, for hard-pressed Manu they made the dawn  shine, along with the sun.
### 2
Two willing messengers, cow-protectors not to be deceived, you who  protect through the months and the many autumns [=years]—
Indra and Vāyu, this lovely praise hymn, speeding to you two, reverently  invokes you for grace and easy passage anew.
### 3
The very wise one [=Soma], gleaming white, the full glory of the teams,  accompanies those whose food is fat [=cows], who are strong through  wealth.
The like-minded (drops) have extended themselves for Vāyu. The men  have done all (ritual actions) bringing good descendants.
### 4
As long as there is endurance of the body, as long as there is strength, as  long as men keep reflecting with their sight,
(so long) drink the clear soma among us, you drinkers of the clear. Indra  and Vāyu, sit down here on this ritual grass.
### 5
Having hitched up the teams bringing coveted heroes, o Indra and Vāyu,  drive nearby on the same chariot,
for here is the foremost of the honey, presented to you two. Now, being  pleased, unharness (your teams) among us.
### 6
The hundred teams, the thousand that accompany you two, bringing all  valuables, o Indra and Vāyu,
with those, good to acquire, drive nearby. Drink, men, of the honey  brought before you.
### 7
Like steeds seeking their share of fame, we Vasiṣṭhas with our lovely  praise hymns,
seeking prizes, would call upon Indra and Vāyu for help. – Do you

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The “teams” of Vāyu are the primary topic of this hymn. They are identified as  thousandfold in the first and last verses of the hymn, forming a conceptual ring,  and in the middle verse (3) the productive ambiguity of the word is exposed: the  teams are not merely the wind-horses that bring Vāyu here, but also the many forms  of wealth he brings to us in return for the sacrifice. The even verses (2 and 4) first  make the invitation to the sacrifice clear and then express wishes for success both  for the priests and poets and for the patrons.
### 1
O Vāyu, drinker of the clear (soma), attend upon us. A thousand are  your teams, o you who bring all valuables.

The exhilarating stalk has been held out close to you, the first drinking  of which you have as your own, o god.

With the teams that you drive forth to the pious one, Vāyu, for your  quest in his house,
hitch up (teams that are) well-nourishing wealth for us, (teams that are)  hero(es) and bounty in cows and horses.
### 4
We who are the Indra-exhilarating ones, (exhilarating) to Vāyu, who are  god-directed and lavishly overflowing for the (Ārya) stranger—
may we, with our patrons, be (always) smashing obstacles; may we, with  our superior men, be (always) victorious in battle over those without  alliance (to us).
### 5
With your teams in the hundreds, in the thousands, drive here to our  ceremony, right up to our sacrifice.

93 (609) Indra and Agni
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
8 verses: triṣṭubh
The first six verses of this hymn, though they contain numerous examples of dual  address of and reference to Indra and Agni together, are strongly skewed toward  Indra. The two gods are called “smiters of Vr̥tra” (vss. 1, 4) and “possessors of  good maces” (Indra’s weapon; vs. 4); they “smite” (Indra’s activity) the enemy (vs.  5) and “drive” to the sacrifice (vs. 6; since Agni is kindled on the ritual ground, he  has no need to drive to it). Moreover the theme is the winning of prizes (vā́ja) and  their distribution, and the besting of opponents: this agonistic cast is more typical  of Indra than of Agni. The last two verses (7–8) are addressed to Agni only, in his  familiar ritual role, mediating between the sacrificer and the gods, including Indra.  But even in these verses Agni’s own character is overlaid with that of other gods: for  instance, in verse 7 he seems to be assimilated to Varuṇa and the other Ādityas in  forgiving offenses.
### 1
Enjoy a blazing praise, newborn today, o Indra and Agni, smiters of  Vr̥tra,
for I keep calling upon you both, good to call, the two who best set out  the prize right away for him who wants it. 2. For you two, o swelling ones, grown in an instant, swollen in expanse,  become winners.
Holding sway over wealth, over abundant pasturage, give your fill of a  prize, substantial but thrilling.
### 3
When the prize-seekers have come to the rite of distribution, the inspired  poets with their visionary thoughts seeking your solicitude,
like steeds reaching the finish line, the men ever calling on Indra
and Agni—
### 4
With his hymns the inspired poet seeking your solicitude reverently  invokes (you) for glorious wealth that provides the foremost portion. Indra and Agni, smiters of Vr̥tra, possessing good maces, further us with  new gifts.
### 5
When the two great opposing (forces) mutually contending, shining with  their own bodies, array themselves at the contest of champions,
at the rite of distribution do you two smash utterly the man unallied to  the gods with those allied to the gods, with the soma-pressing folk.
### 6
Drive right up to this soma-pressing of ours here, Indra and Agni, to  (show) benevolence,
for you never have disregarded us. Might I turn you two here with
perpetual prizes.
### 7
Agni, kindled by this reverence, you should call Mitra, Varuṇa, and  Indra here.
Whatever offense we have committed, that forgive; that let (them and)  Aryaman and Aditi unloose (from us).

Aspiring to these desires, Agni, might we attain prizes in company with  you two.
Let Indra, Viṣṇu, and the Maruts not overlook us. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.

12 verses: gāyatrī 1–11, anuṣṭubh 12, arranged in trcas ̥
This hymn consists of four sets of tr̥cas, and if each tr̥ca is considered originally a  separate hymn, the principle of arrangement is not violated. There are two main  themes, the varieties of poetic thought and its product, verbal praise, which the  poets address to the two gods, and the hope that these gods will favor these poets  over their rivals (see esp. vss. 3, 7, 8, 12). Despite the emphasis on poetic inspiration,  there seems to be relatively little of it on display in this hymn, which is a bricolage  of quotations from other hymns. The two gods, Indra and Agni, also lack traits,  individually and collectively.

O Indra and Agni, you superior men—not to evil, nor to imprecation make us subject—nor to scorn.

To Indra, to Agni we raise lofty reverence, a (hymn) with a good twist, and nourishing streams (of truth?) with our visionary thought as we  seek help.

Don’t let the malice of a nobody, an ungenerous mortal, reach us. Indra and Agni, extend (us) shelter.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
The multitalented goddess of wisdom and patroness of arts and music familiar from  classical Hindu sources is not the Sarasvatī of the R̥gveda: in this text she is first and foremost a river, and not the mythical river Sarasvatī of later times, but a real,  physical river that flows “from the mountains to the sea” (see vs. 2). Her distin guishing characteristics are all associated with this physical nature: the power and  beauty of her ever-flowing current, and the nourishment and riches it brings with  it. She is often mentioned along with her sister rivers, as first among equals, and  in this hymn (vs. 3) and the next (VII.96.4–6) also with her shadowy male coun terpart Sarasvant.
### 1
She has flowed forth with her surge, with her nourishment—Sarasvatī is a  buttress, a metal fortress.
Thrusting forward all the other waters with her greatness, the river drives  like a lady-charioteer.
### 2
Alone of the rivers, Sarasvatī shows clear, as she goes gleaming from the  mountains all the way to the sea.
Taking note of the abundant wealth of the world, she has milked out  ghee and milk for the Nāhuṣa.
### 3
He has grown strong as a manly one among maidens, a bullish bull calf  among the (river-maidens) worthy of the sacrifice.
He provides a prizewinner to the benefactors. He should groom his body  for winning.
### 4
And this Sarasvatī, the well-portioned, will harken to this sacrifice of  ours, taking pleasure in it,
being implored by reverential ones with their knees fixed. With wealth as  her yokemate, she is even higher than her companions.
### 5
Here are (oblations) being poured all the way to you (rivers), along with  reverences. Take pleasure in the praise, Sarasvatī.
Being set in your dearest shelter, may we stand nearby it like a
sheltering tree.
### 6
And this Vasiṣṭha here has opened up the doors of truth for you,
well-portioned Sarasvatī.
Strengthen (him?), resplendent one; grant prizes to the praiser. – Do you  protect us always with your blessings.

Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: brhat ̥ ī 1, satobrhat ̥ ī 2, prastārapaṅkti 3, as extended pragātha; gāyatrī 4–6,  as trcḁ
This hymn is not metrically unified (see Oldenberg 1888: 200). The first three verses,  dedicated to Sarasvatī, consist of a pragātha (vss. 1–2) of the usual type (br̥hatī alter nating with satobr̥hatī), extended with a third verse in prastārapaṅkti (12 12 8 8). The1004 VII.96
other three verses form a conventional tr̥ca, dedicated to Sarasvant, whose charac ter seems little different from his better-known counterpart Sarasvatī. It is perhaps  the identity of the “bachelors” in verse 4 that suggests that prayer to a male divinity  would be appropriate. But the attribution of a “swelling breast” to this same male  in verse 6 is distinctly odd; a nourishing, wealth-giving breast (using the same word  stána) for suckling is attributed in I.164.49 to Sarasvatī, a more suitable figure by  her gender.
The phrase “both stalks” (ubhé . . . ándhasī) in verse 2 has occasioned much  discussion, and in recent years some political and military conclusions have  been drawn from one quite speculative interpretation of it—conclusions not  justified by the evidence, in our opinion. Although most interpreters take the  “two stalks” as referring to two different beverages, one of which is soma (the  usual referent of singular ándhas is the soma stalk), either soma and surā or  soma and milk, some, following Grassmann, interpret the word as referring  metaphorically to the two banks of the river. From this interpretation it is  inferred that the Pūrus crossed the Sarasvatī and conquered the territory on the  other side—a conclusive leap based on a shaky interpretation of this word. By  contrast, we interpret the term on the basis of the twinned hymn VII.95, whose  corresponding verse 2 states that Sarasvatī “milked out ghee and milk,” a liquid  pairing that may well be referred to by the dual in verse 2 of this immediately  following hymn.
### 1
I shall sing a lofty speech: she is the lordly one of the rivers.
Magnify Sarasvatī with well-twisted (hymns); with praises (magnify) the  two world-halves, o Vasiṣṭha.
### 2
Since by your might, resplendent lady, the Pūrus preside over
both “stalks” [=honey and ghee? soma and surā? two banks
of river?],
become our helper, with the Maruts as companions. Stimulate the
generosity of the benefactors.
### 3
Good Sarasvatī will do good. She shows brightly as the unstinting one,  rich in prize mares,
while she is being hymned as she was by Jamadagni and she is being
praised as she was by Vasiṣṭha.
### 4
As bachelors in search of wives, in search of sons, possessing lovely  gifts,
we call upon Sarasvant.
### 5
Your waves, Sarasvant, which are rich in honey, dripping with ghee— with them become our helper.
### 6
The swelling breast of Sarasvant, which is lovely for all to see—
we would share (in it and) in offspring and refreshment.

97 (613) Indra (1), Br̥haspati (2, 4–8), Indra and
Brahmaṇaspati (3, 9), Indra and Br̥haspati (10)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: triṣṭubh
According to the Anukramaṇī (whose identifications are reproduced here in the  heading) there is a wide array of divine dedicands for the individual verses of this  hymn: Indra alone, Br̥haspati alone, Indra and Br̥haspati, and Indra and the more  transparently named Brahmaṇaspati (“Lord of the Sacred Formulation”). The  hymn is more carefully structured than the random listing would suggest, however.
First, as has often been discussed above, Hanns-Peter Schmidt (1968) has shown  that Br̥haspati was originally an epithet of Indra in his priestly role and only gradu ally split off into a separate god. As in IV.50 this divine history is recapitulated in  part in the progress of this hymn, though in a different way from the earlier hymn.  For most of the hymn only one of the divine figures is on stage at a time: verse  1 has Indra, verse 2 Br̥haspati, and Br̥haspati holds sway in verses 4–8. Even in  verse 3, supposedly dedicated to both Indra and Brahmaṇaspati, the two are not  depicted together, and in fact the phraseology seems designed to identify Indra as  Brahmaṇaspati: the two-word phrase bráhmaṇas pátim “lord of the sacred formula
tion” in pāda b is, it seems, paraphrased with the defining relative clause of d, refer ring to Indra: yó bráhmaṇaḥ ...rā́jā “who is king of the sacred formulation,” with  “king” substituting for “lord,” thus superimposing the one on the other. What we  are claiming here, then, is that in verses 1–8 the divine names Indra and Br̥haspati/ Brahmaṇaspati refer to a single divine figure, Indra.
But when the transparent designation Brahmaṇaspati recurs in verse 9, it is  immediately preceded by the dual pronoun vām “you two”; there must therefore  now be two divine addressees, and the split between Indra and his epithet has been  effected. The last two verses (9–10) call upon them both, using dual verbs, pro
nouns, and vocatives quite insistently. It is because we consider bráhmaṇas páti- an  epithet in verse 3 and a divine name in verse 9 that we have translated them differ ently in the two verses. Notice also that Brahmaṇaspati, as opposed to Br̥haspati, is
only found in verses also containing the noun bráhman “sacred formulation.” But the hymn has another divine presence, not named but clearly there, who  complicates the identity problem even more. The entire hymn is set on the ritual  ground; this scene is set at the very beginning, in verse 1, starting with the word  yajñé “at the sacrifice” and continuing with a clear depiction of the locus of ritual  offerings, where men and gods (including Indra) meet. But, in the middle verses  mentioning only Br̥haspati (4–8), that god is described in ways extremely suggestive  of Agni, the ritual fire: he sits on the womb (vs. 4); he is both bright and roaring (vs.  5), bright, golden, and good to enter (vs. 7), and most clearly, in the image of verse  6 he is dark below but possessed of horses like ruddy clouds. All of this phraseol ogy has clear counterparts in descriptions of Agni. Thus, the divine figure Indra/
1006 VII.97
Br̥haspati is identified here in this ritual context with the ultimate ritually oriented  god, Agni. This identification is found elsewhere; see especially V.43.12. It is noteworthy, but not surprising, that the usual mythological association of  Indra/Br̥haspati with the Vala cave is entirely absent.
### 1
At the sacrifice, at the seat of men (coming) from heaven and from  earth, where men seeking the gods become exhilarated,
where pressings are pressed for Indra, he will come at first for
exhilaration and to vitality.
### 2
We choose divine help. Br̥haspati holds himself ready for us here, o  comrades,
so that we might become without offense to the one who grants
rewards, who is a giver to us from afar, like a father.
### 3
Him, the preeminent, well-disposed Lord of the Sacred Formulation  will I sing, with reverence, with oblations.
Let his divine signal-call mightily accompany Indra, who is the king of  the god-created sacred formulation.
### 4
Let him sit as the dearest in our womb here—Br̥haspati who is
all-desirable [/granting all wishes].
Desire for wealth in good heroes—that will he give. He will carry us
across the parched places unharmed.
### 5
The recitation enjoyable to the immortal one—these immortals here,  born of old, have imparted it to us.
We would invoke the brightly roaring one, worthy of the sacrifice of the  dwelling places, unassailing Br̥haspati.
### 6
The capable, ruddy horses who pull together are pulling Br̥haspati, who is simply strength itself, whose seat has darkness while (the horses)  like a cloud clothe themselves in ruddy form.
### 7
He certainly is flame-bright; he is a preening (bird) with a hundred  feathers; having a golden axe, he is vigorous, sun-winning—
Br̥haspati—good (for libations) to enter, lofty, the best at making the  pressed drink in abundance for his comrades.
### 8
The two goddesses, the world-halves, begetters of the god, strengthened  Br̥haspati with their greatness.
Comrades, exert your skill for the one whose skill is to be besought. He  will make good fords, easy to cross, for the sacred formulation.
### 9
Here is a well-twisted (hymn) for you two, o Brahmaṇaspati. A sacred  formulation has been made for Indra, the mace-bearer.
Aid our insightful thoughts; awaken plentiful gifts. Exhaust the
hostilities of the stranger, of the rapacious ones.

98 (614) Indra (1–6), Indra and Br̥haspati (7)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
This is really an Indra hymn; the final verse dedicated to Indra and Br̥haspati (vs.  7) is simply repeated from the previous hymn (VII.97.10). The theme of the rest of  the hymn is Indra’s close affinity with and unslakable desire for soma. Not only is  it the regular ritual offering that he seeks daily (vss. 1–2), but it belonged to him  from birth (vs. 3) and became his special substance after his first victories (vs. 5).  The deeds and power of Indra are also celebrated. Intriguingly, his mother first  proclaims his greatness (vs. 3): the mention of Indra’s mother, especially in connec
tion with soma, always tantalizingly alludes to apparently fraught family dynamics  associated with Indra’s birth (see III.48 and IV.18). Verse 5, near the end of the  hymn, repeats the proclamation of his deeds, using the formula sometimes found  and expected at the beginning of a hymn (see, e.g., I.32.1, I.154.1), though not rare  later in the unfolding of the poem.
The poet, of course, wishes to profit from the battle-might soma inspires in  Indra (vs. 4) and receive some of the spoils of his victories (vs. 6).
### 1
Adhvaryus, offer the ruddy, milked plant to the bull of the settled  domains.
Better at finding a drinking hole than a buffalo, Indra travels everywhere,  seeking a man who has pressed the soma.
### 2
What you made your own dear food on a distant day, every day you  desire the drinking just of that.
Taking pleasure with heart and with mind, being eager, drink the soma  drinks set out, Indra.
### 3
On being born, you drank the soma for strength. Your mother
proclaimed your greatness.
Indra, you filled the wide midspace; through combat you made a wide  realm for the gods.
### 4
When you will set to fighting those who think themselves great, we shall  overcome them, though they are exulting in their arms.
Or when, Indra, with your superior men you will attack the defensive  forces, with you may we win the contest that brings good fame.
### 5
I proclaim the first deeds of Indra, proclaim the present ones that he has  performed.
When he overcame the godless magic powers, then soma became
his alone.

Yours is all this (wealth in) livestock all around, which you see with the  eye of the sun.
You alone are the cowherd of cows, Indra. Might we share in your

99 (615) Viṣṇu (1–3, 7), Indra and Viṣṇu (4–6)
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
As has been discussed previously, Viṣṇu, one of the great gods of classical Hinduism,  is a marginal figure in the R̥gveda, generally associated with Indra. Viṣṇu’s primary  mythic exploit in Vedic is the “three strides” he made across the cosmos, measuring  out, enlarging, and mapping the cosmic spaces. In middle Vedic literature and later,  Viṣṇu takes the form of a dwarf when making these vast strides, but there is no trace  of this notion in the R̥gveda.
The first three verses of this hymn are addressed solely to Viṣṇu and allude to his  establishment and fixation of the cosmic spaces, though without directly mention ing his three strides. The first verse does sketch (in the second half) the three sepa rate realms with which Viṣṇu is associated, an indirect reference to the three strides;  but in verses 2 and 3 the action that creates the spaces is “propping,” an action  more characteristic of Indra. However, in verse 3 Viṣṇu fastens the earth down  with “loom pegs,” a homely device in a way. The word (mayū́kha) is found only one  other time in the R̥gveda, in verse 2 of the late hymn X.130, where the creation of  the sacrifice is likened to weaving. This verse is also noteworthy for Viṣṇu’s direct  address to Heaven and Earth as he props them apart.
The second three verses (4–6) are dedicated to Indra and Viṣṇu together, and  though heroic deeds are attributed to both of them, the deeds themselves are ones  assigned only to Indra elsewhere (e.g., the destruction of Śambara and of Varcin in  vs. 5). It is not unusual in hymns addressed to dual divinities for the more dynamic  mythology of one to be credited to both.
The final verse is dedicated to Viṣṇu alone (Śipiviṣṭa being an enigmatic epithet  of Viṣṇu found in the R̥gveda only in this and the following hymn), though the sen timents of the verse are conventional. For further on the epithet, see the next hymn.
### 1
O you who have grown with your body beyond measure, they do not  attain to your greatness.
We (only) know both your dusky realms of the earth; god Viṣṇu, you  yourself know the farthest one.
### 2
No one now born, no one previously born has reached the far end of  your greatness, god Viṣṇu.
You propped up the vault, lofty and high; you fixed fast the eastern peak  of the earth. 3. “Since you two are full of refreshment, rich in milk-cows, become ones  affording good pasture for Manu through your favor”—
(So saying,) you propped apart these two world-halves, Viṣṇu; you fixed  the earth fast all around with loom-pegs.
### 4
You two made a wide place for the sacrifice, while you were generating  the sun, the dawn, the fire.
The magical wiles even of the Dāsa Vr̥ṣaśipra did you smite in the battle  drives, you two superior men.
### 5
O Indra and Viṣṇu, you pierced the nine and ninety fortified strongholds  of Śambara.
At one blow you smite the hundred and thousand heroes of the lord  Varcin without opposition.
### 6
Here is a lofty inspired thought that strengthens the two lofty,
wide-striding, powerful ones.
I have granted you two praise at the rites of distribution, o Viṣṇu; you  two, swell the nourishments in the ritual enclosures, o Indra.
### 7
I make the vaṣaṭ-cry to you from my mouth, Viṣṇu. Enjoy this oblation  of mine, Śipiviṣṭa.
Let my lovely praises, my hymns strengthen you. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.

100 (616) Viṣṇu
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
7 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn begins conventionally enough, with a mortal offering sacrifice to the god  (vs. 1) and a request for gifts in return (vs. 2). Viṣṇu’s three strides are the subject  of the following two, responsive verses (3–4). Verse 3d also introduces the theme  of Viṣṇu’s name, which is the subject of the last two real verses of the hymn (5–6,  since vs. 7 is merely a repetition of the final verse of VII.99). The enigmatic epithet  śipiviṣṭá found in the last verse of the last hymn (VII.99.7) is, as it were, interrogated  in these verses. In verse 6 the poet, who boasts that he knows the hidden patterns,  sets out to proclaim the god’s name, while addressing him as Śipiviṣṭa, and then  asks in the next verse whether the god’s own proclamation of himself as Śipiviṣṭa  was meant to be ignored or passed over. The poet then mysteriously alludes to two  different forms of the god, which may (or may not) correspond to two different  names. The hymn does not resolve these questions, perhaps leaving the shadowy  figure of Viṣṇu to be fully developed in the ensuing centuries.
### 1
Now the mortal desiring to gain gets his share, if he does pious service to  wide-ranging Viṣṇu,
1010 VII.101
will set the sacrifice in motion with fully focused mind, and will seek to  attract here such a one, favorable to men.
### 2
You, Viṣṇu, traveling your ways—give benevolent thought destined for  all people, concentrated thought,
so that you will give us our fill of abundant welfare, of greatly glittering  wealth in horses.
### 3
Three times did the quick god stride with his greatness across this earth  worth a hundred verses.
Let Viṣṇu be preeminent, stronger than the strong, for vibrant is the
name of this stalwart one.
### 4
Quick Viṣṇu strode across this earth for a dwelling place for Manu,  showing his favor.
Firmly fixed are his peoples, (even) the weak. He, affording good birth,  has made (them) wide dwelling.
### 5
This name of yours, o Śipiviṣṭa, of you the stranger do I proclaim today,  I who know the (hidden) patterns.
I hymn you, the strong—I, less strong—you who rule over this dusky  realm in the distance.
### 6
Was (this speech) of yours to be disregarded, when you proclaimed of  yourself: “I am Śipiviṣṭa”?
Do not hide away this shape from us, when you have appeared in another  form in the clash.
### 7
I make the vaṣaṭ-cry to you from my mouth, Viṣṇu. Enjoy this oblation  of mine, Śipiviṣṭa.
Let my lovely praises, my hymns strengthen you. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.

101 (617) Parjanya
Kumāra Āgneya or Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
6 verses: triṣṭubh
Dedicated to Parjanya, the god of thunder, this hymn celebrates the fructifying rain  in sometimes cryptic and riddling terms, which probably involve simultaneous natu ral and ritual reference. The number three is a recurrent theme: the “three speeches”  of verse 1; the “triply layered” shelter and “triply turned” light of verse 2; the three  heavens, three stages of flowing water, and three buckets of verse 4. There is also, as  often with R̥gvedic atmospheric phenomena, gender ambiguity and gender shifting.  The bull of verse 1 creates a calf as his embryo. In verse 3 an unidentified subject  (though surely Parjanya) is sometimes a barren cow and sometimes gives birth.  (The “he” of the translation is a necessary English compromise: the Sanskrit has  no pronominal subject and therefore no gender identifier.) Later in that verse the  father provides milk to the mother. As is often the case with R̥gvedic enigmas, it is likely that there is no one correct answer to the riddles, which are instead meant to  stimulate creative speculation.
### 1
Speak forth the three speeches with light at their front, which milk this  udder milking out honey.
Creating the calf, the embryo of the plants [=Agni], as soon as he is born  the bull sets to bellowing.
### 2
The one who is the increaser of plants, who of the waters, who, as god,  holds sway over the whole moving world,
he will extend triply layered sheltering shelter, triply turned very superior  light to us.
### 3
Sometimes he becomes a barren cow, sometimes he gives birth; he has  fashioned his own body as he wished.
The mother accepts the milk of the father. With it the father grows
strong, with it the son.
### 4
In whom all the creatures abide, (in whom) the three heavens; (in whom)  the waters have flowed in three stages—
(his) three buckets for pouring drip an abundance of honey all
around.
### 5
Here is a speech for Parjanya the self-ruling: let it be the intimate of his  heart. He will enjoy it.
Let there be joy-bringing rain for us; let the plants whose protectors are  the gods be well-berried.
### 6
“The bull is the inseminator of each and every (plant). In him is the  life-breath of the moving (world) and of the still.”
Let this truth be protective of me for a hundred autumns. – Do you
protect us always with your blessings.

To Parjanya sing forth—to the son of heaven who grants rewards. Let him seek pasturage for us.

103 (619) Frogs
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
10 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 1
A rain charm, which cleverly matches accurate description of frogs noisily emerging  from estivation and mating at the beginning of the rainy season with the behavior  of priests at a particular ritual, the Pravargya (see esp. vss. 7–9). Although there  has been much debate about whether this hymn satirizes priests by comparing them  to frogs or instead is to be taken with deadly seriousness, the truth no doubt lies  somewhere in between. The poet obviously took great delight in his skill at match
ing frog behavior with ritual behavior and is unlikely to have been unaware of the  potentially comic aspects of the comparison; however, the explosive fertility of the  frogs provides a model for similar increase in the human sphere, and therefore the  comparison has a serious purpose.
Attention to modern studies of animal behavior allows us to see just how  much careful observation of frogs lies behind the depiction of the frogs here, and  understanding anuran mating habits deepens our understanding of the poem. (See  Jamison 1993.) For example, the frog lying “like a dried-out leather bag” is a coun
terintuitively accurate representation of a frog in estivation: some really do go dor mant and dry up during the dry season, and “adding water” plumps them up and  revives them. Once revived, the chorus of frogs begins, the purpose of which is to  draw female frogs to the males, who are vocalizing, for mating. This antiphonal  chorus is described in verses 2–6. Since the calls of different species are quite dis tinctive (as sketched in vs. 6), the different cries serve to attract conspecific females  to the appropriate male. The actual mating posture of frogs is described in verse  4: it involves the male approaching the female from behind and grasping her firmly  for as long as it takes—which for some species can be quite awhile (days or weeks).
Another important aspect of the hymn is its comparison of the frog chorus to  a pedagogical situation (see esp. vss. 3, 5), in which the father/teacher speaks and  the pupils exactly repeat his utterance. This is the clearest and earliest depiction of  pedagogy in ancient India and is an example of how our knowledge of everyday  life at that time must be obliquely won. The most famous word in this hymn is  found in verse 3, the phonologically aberrant akhkhala (underlying the so-called  cvi-formation, akhkhalī-[kŕ̥tya]). On the one hand, it would take a very austere  interpreter, and a killjoy, not to recognize this as an onomatopoetic imitation of a  froggy sound; on the other hand, in the inspired analysis of Paul Thieme (1954),  this is, in Middle Indic guise, a representation of the word akṣara “syllable.” What  the frog pupils are doing is “making syllables,” that is, repeating the utterance of  the teacher verbatim, as sound, not meaning. This is a pedagogical technique that  endures to this day in traditional Vedic learning. It is also telling that the word  akhkhala is in Middle Indic form, as the everyday language of the R̥gvedic poets,  and especially of their wives and children, had most likely already undergone many of the phonological and morphological changes characteristic of Middle Indic, but  only found in preserved texts from a much later period. Instruction of the young,  as well as most ordinary conversation, was no doubt carried out in this language  rather than in the high Vedic Sanskrit of the hymns.
As for the ritual application, the Pravargya rite occurs after a year-long con secration, like that referred to in verse 1 and brought to an end in verses 7–9. The  most salient feature of the Pravargya is the offering of the gharma drink, referred to  specifically in verses 8–9, the heated milk-offering that boils until it overflows. The  last, and most important, implicit comparison between frogs and priests turns on  this ritual offering: the prodigious discharge of eggs after anuran mating, especially  by many pairs simultaneously, must have reminded the poet of the frothy bubbling  overflow of the boiling milk. And since the thousands of eggs released are a tan gible sign of fertility and increase, the frogs are seen as assuring increase for us as  well, in the final verse (10), culminating in the “Pressing of Thousands.”
Oldenberg suggests that that this hymn was added at this point in the Maṇḍala,  just after the two Parjanya hymns (VII.101–2), because of the presence of Parjanya  in the first verse. It is certainly appropriate for the rainy season.
### 1
Having lain still for a year, (like) brahmins following their
commandment,
the frogs have spoken forth a speech quickened by Parjanya.
### 2
When the heavenly waters have come to him, lying like a dried leather  bag in the pond,
like the bellow of cows with their calves, the call of the frogs comes
together here.
### 3
When it has rained on them, who are yearning and thirsting, when the  rainy season has come,
saying “akhkhala” [/repeating syllables] like a son to a father (at
lessons), one goes up close to the other who is speaking.
### 4
One of the two grasps the other from behind, when they have become  exhilarated in the discharge of the waters,
when the frog, rained upon, has hopped and hopped, and the speckled  one mixes his speech with the green one.
### 5
Once one of them speaks the speech of the other, like a pupil that of his  teacher,
(then) a whole section of them speaks as if in unison, when you of good  speech speak amid the waters.
### 6
One of them has a cow’s bellow, one a goat’s bleat; one is speckled,  one green.
Bearing the same name but different forms, they ornament their voice in  many ways as they speak.
### 7
Like brahmins at an “Overnight” soma ritual, speaking around (a soma  vessel) full like a pond,1014 VII.104
you cycle around to that day of the year, which, o frogs, is the one
marking the rainy season.
### 8
The brahmins, having soma, have made speech, creating their yearly  sacred formulation.
The Adhvaryus, having the hot ritual milk-drink (at the Pravargya
ritual), sweating, become visible; none are hidden.
### 9
They guarded the godly establishment of the twelve(-month); these men  do not confound the season.
In a year, when the rainy season has come, the heated ritual milk-drinks  obtain their own release.
### 10
The one with a cow’s bellow has given, the one with a goat’s bleat has  given, the speckled one has given, the green one (has given) us goods. The frogs, giving hundred of cows, lengthened (their/our) life at a
“Pressing of Thousands.”

104 (620) Destroying Demons, Using Imprecations and Curses.  Indra and Soma (1–7, 15, 25), Indra (8, 16, 19–22, 24), Soma (9,  12–13), Agni (10, 14), Gods (11), Pressing Stones (17), Maruts (18),  Vasisṭha’s Hopes for Himself (23ab), Earth and Midspace (23cd) ̣
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
25 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1–6, 18, 21, 23; anuṣṭubh 25; jagatī or triṣṭubh 7
This long and rambling hymn coming at the very end of the VIIth Maṇḍala is obvi ously an addition to the original collection, not only on formal grounds but on those  of content. Not a praise hymn, it calls upon a series of gods and other powers to  destroy all manner of threats to us, in all manner of creatively bloodthirsty ways. It  therefore has more in common with what we might term the “instrumental” hymns  of the Atharvaveda than with the R̥gvedic manner, and it is in fact found in almost  identical form as Atharvaveda Śaunaka VIII.4 and in Atharvaveda Paippalāda  XVI. The relentless focus on the elimination of evildoers and the changes rung on  the methods of destroying them can give an impression of homogeneity, despite the  number of different gods called on (mostly Indra and Soma, but with a number of  others interspersed: see the Anukramaṇī ascriptions above).
Nonetheless smaller divisions can be discerned within the hymn as a whole. The  mood is set by verse 1, with no fewer than eight violent imperatives addressed to  Indra and Soma, urging action against the wicked. The first five verses follow the  same pattern: an initial vocative índrāsomā “o Indra and Soma,” followed by imper
atives addressed to those gods. The sixth verse starts the same, with the vocative,  but continues somewhat differently: rather than ordering the gods to unleash their  powers in yet another way, the poet expresses the hope that his own thought (and  its verbal expression) will envelop the gods like horse-tackle. This prayer-offering and the sacred formulations (bráhman) that Indra and Soma are urged to quicken  in pāda d brings the brutal first section to a more benign and R̥gvedic conclusion. Verse 7 is also addressed to Indra and Soma, also in the vocative, but with the  vocative postponed till the beginning of the second half of the verse. This slight  change in structure allows this verse to serve as a transition to the next subsection,  which continues, in our opinion, through verse 11 and is defined by a ring provided  by the preverb práti “against, in response to,” opening 7a and 11c. Though the  demands for action continue in this section, they take a more personal turn. In the  first section, the gods were simply ordered to destroy evildoers; in this section the  target is evildoers who act against us (as the práti signals). These verses all posit an  innocent victim (usually 1st person) of the malefactor who is to be destroyed by the  gods. Moreover, the avengers are no longer just Indra and Soma in tandem; each  verse has a different designated hitter: just Indra in 8, Soma in 9, Agni in 10, and  the gods in general in 11. The nature of the offenses has also become more sharply  defined, in that the transgressions involve evil or false speech (even the “cheat” of  vss. 10–11 means literally “desire to deceive”). Although evil speech and hostility to  sacred speech were already found in verse 2, these linguistic offenses were only some  of the condemned activities in the first section; they are the only ones here. In the two next verses (12–13), speech, true and false, is foregrounded, and the  punishment of the speaker of falsehood is reassuringly affirmed. But the mood  changes abruptly in verse 14: the speaker seems to stand accused of the very offenses  he called upon the gods to punish; the innocent 1st persons of verses 7–11 are the  objects of Agni’s anger. The aborted conditional clause of 14ab seems to convey the  speaker’s distress. In verses 15–16 the speaker swears a dramatic oath concerning  the truth of his denial and calls down further destruction on the man who falsely  accused him. The accusation is that he is a yātu(dhā́na), a “sorcerer.” The speaker’s  ringing assertion of his innocence and his powerful curse against his accuser brings  this section of the hymn to a resounding conclusion.
Indeed, we are of the opinion that the rest of the hymn was simply tacked onto  what precedes because it concerns sorcerers, using the same word yātu, and simi lar demonic beings. The tone of the remainder (vss. 17–25) is very different, with  the theme of true and false speech recessive. The enemies are sorcerers in various  animal forms, and the sense of personal menace and of human evildoing is almost  entirely absent. Nonetheless, even if we are correct that these nine verses were origi nally independent, the fact that the full hymn was transmitted independently in the  R̥gveda and both recensions of the Atharvaveda would indicate that the join was  made early.
The Indian tradition (and many Western commentators, including Geldner)  reads Vasiṣṭha’s biography into the dramatic middle of the hymn, interpreting  the accusation and denial in verses 15–16 as evidence for the hostility between  Vasiṣṭha and Viśvāmitra found in much later texts. In this interpretation Viśvāmitra  is the accuser, and Vasiṣṭha the outraged 1st-person speaker. Needless to say,  there is absolutely no evidence for this in the hymn itself, and no evidence for the
1016 VII.104
Vasiṣṭha–Viśvāmitra feud elsewhere in the R̥gveda. It is always necessary to be wary  about “reading backward” into the R̥gveda and other Vedic texts.
### 1
Indra and Soma, scorch the demonic force, crush it! Pin down those  who grow strong in darkness, you bulls.
Pound aside the unobservant ones, burn them down. Smite, shove,
grind down the voracious.
### 2
Indra and Soma, like a pot on the fire let your evil heat seethe against  the one who speaks evil.
Set forth unrelenting hatred against the hater of the sacred formulation,  the eater of raw flesh, the one with a terrible glance—against the
worm-eater.
### 3
Indra and Soma, spear the evil-doers within their hole out into
darkness that offers nothing to hold onto,
so that no one at all will come up from there again. Let this power of  yours, full of battle fury, be for vanquishing.
### 4
Indra and Soma, make the crushing weapon of death roll from heaven  and from earth toward the one who speaks evil.
Fashion a reverberating (weapon) up out of the mountains, with which  you grind down the demonic force that has been growing strong.
### 5
Indra and Soma, make it roll from heaven. With fire-heated (weapons)  that smite like stones,
with unaging (weapons) whose murderous force is searing heat, spear  the voracious ones down into a deep place. Let them go to silence.
### 6
Indra and Soma, let this thought here encircle you on all sides, like a  girth-band two prizewinning horses—
the thought that, as ritual offering [/invocation], I impel around you,  with wisdom (as the goad). Like lords of men, quicken these sacred
formulations.
### 7
Keep (this) in mind! With your thrusting ways smite the deceits of the  demon with his wreckage.
Indra and Soma, let there be no good passage for the evildoer who with  his deceit ever shows hostility against us.
### 8
Whoever bears witness against me with untruthful words, as I behave  with guileless mind,
like waters grabbed in a fist, let the speaker of nothing come to
nothing, Indra.
### 9
Those who distort (my) guileless speech in their (usual) ways, or who  spoil an auspicious one according to their wont,
let Soma give them over to the serpent or set them in the lap of
Dissolution.
### 10
Whoever wishes to cheat us of the essence of food, o Agni, or of our  horses, of our cows, of our bodies, let the swindling thief who does the theft go to insignificance. Let him  be bent double, along with his life and lineage.
### 11
Let him be far in the distance, along with his life and lineage; let him be  beneath all three earths.
Let his glory dry up, o gods—whoever wishes to cheat us by day and  whoever by night.
### 12
Good discrimination is (easy) for the perceptive man: the two (types of)  speech, true and untrue, contend with each other.
Which of the two is true, whichever is straighter, just that Soma aids— he smites the untrue.
### 13
Truly, Soma does not promote the crooked man, nor one who sustains  his rule perversely.
He smites demonic force; he smites one who speaks what is untrue.
Both lie in the toils of Indra.
### 14
If I were a man with false gods, or if I call upon the gods wrongly, o  Agni... .
Why are you angry at us, Jātavedas? Let those whose speech is deceitful  to you attend upon dissolution.
### 15
Let me die today if I am a sorcerer, or if I have scorched the lifespan  of a man.
And he should be separated from ten (generations of?) heroes, whoever  says falsely to me: “you sorcerer.”
### 16
Who says to me, who am without sorcery, “you sorcerer,” or who,  (though) a demon, says “I am pure,”
let Indra smite him with a great weapon of death. Let him fall lowest of  all creation.
### 17
She who goes forth by night like a nightjar [?], concealing her own body  by deceit,
she should fall down into holes without end. Let the pressing stones  smash the demons with their tramplings.
### 18
Spread out among the clans, Maruts. Seek, grab, crush together the  demons—
the ones who, having become birds, fly through the nights, or those who  have deployed their swindles at the divine ceremony.
### 19
Roll the stone forth from heaven, Indra; hone the soma-honed one  entirely, bounteous one.
From in front, from behind, from below, from above, strike at the
demons with the mountain.
### 20
These very dog-sorcerers are flying. Those inclined to deceit desire to  deceive Indra, the undeceivable.
The able one is honing his weapon of death for the slanderers. Now he  discharges the missile toward the sorcerers.
1018 VII.104
### 21
Indra has become the one who pounds aside the sorcerers, the  oblation-stealers, those who seek to ambush.
The able one, splitting them like an axe a tree, breaking them like pots,  advances against those who are really demons.
### 22
The owl-sorcerer, the owlet-sorcerer—smash them, and the dog-sorcerer  and the wolf-sorcerer,
the eagle-sorcerer and the vulture-sorcerer. As if with a mill-stone,  pulverize the demonic power, Indra.
### 23
Don’t let the demonic power of the sorcerers reach us. Let (Dawn)  banish with her dawning the pair that are worm-eaters.
Let Earth protect us from earthly constraint; let the Midspace protect  us from heavenly (constraint).
### 24
Indra, smash the male sorcerer and the female exulting in her  magic power.
Let the no-necks with feckless gods shake to pieces. Let them not look  upon the sun as it rises.
### 25
Look on; look out: Indra and Soma, be vigilant.
Hurl the weapon of death at the demonic forces, the missile at the  sorcerers.
