By all standard interpr. the Maruts are the subjects of this dānastuti, but it is worth noting that they are not named -- and so it is possible that a set of human patrons, assimilated to the Maruts and thus endowed with their prestige, are the actual donors praised.

Note the etymological chaining between the subj. of 16e śíkvasaḥ and 17a śākínaḥ, both deriv. from √śak. This could be evidence of the identity of the subjects (Maruts both), or it could be another way of conferring Marut qualities on the human patrons.

The unbalanced āmreḍita ékam-ekā is curiously formed. AiG III.395 suggests that the pl. ekā has been attracted to the following śatā́, whose attribute it is. It also seems an attempt, utilizing both sg. ékam and pl. ekā, to express the awkward distributive, of one hundred per each of seven Maruts, producing a total of plural hundreds.
