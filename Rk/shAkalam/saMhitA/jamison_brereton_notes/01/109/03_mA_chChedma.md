The context of this verse is clearly the soma sacrifice, but there is no general agreement on the identity (/-ties) of the participants. I am inclined to see the pl. bulls as the pressing stones, which are then renumbered as dual in the last pāda. Pressing stones are called bulls, are yoked, have reins, and are plural in pressing-stone hymns (for all these, see, e.g., X.94, esp. vss. 6-8). But it is also possible that the bulls here are the priests guiding the stones. I find highly unlikely Old’s view that the two stones in d are Indra and Agni.
