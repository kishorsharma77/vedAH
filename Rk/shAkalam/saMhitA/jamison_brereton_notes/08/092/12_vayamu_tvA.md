Case disharmony between simile and frame, as discussed in Jamison 1982, faciliated by the syntactic ambivanence of raṇáya-, which has both causative and non-causative uses. Here the frame is causative, “we make you take pleasure in hymns” (vayám u tvā … ukthéṣu raṇayāmasi), while the simile is non-causative, “as cows (do) in grain” (gā́vo ná yávaseṣv ā́).
