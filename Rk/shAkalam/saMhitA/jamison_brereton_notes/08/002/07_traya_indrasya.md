The three soma drinks might refer to the unsatisfactory types in vs. 5 or to the soma at the three pressings, but most likely to the three types mentioned in vs. 9 (the final verse of the tṛca of which this is the first). We might think of this as a species of “ritual repair”: the poor versions of soma in vs. 5 are adjusted slightly to produce the properly prepared ones in this tṛca.

The referent of své in c is unclear. (Note in passing that if read as distracted suvé [with HvN], its first syllable matches sutā́saḥ of b and sutapā́vnaḥ. However, with Old I prefer to distract the final word to sutapā́vanaḥ; cf. somapā́van-, whose oblique forms require distraction although they are written with -vn-.) If we assume that své refers to the subject, then it must be soma’s dwelling, whatever that is (the ritual ground?). The only other personage mentioned in the verse is Indra, but it is unlikely to be his dwelling — pace Ge, who construes sutapā́vnaḥ with the loc. phrase (“im eigenen Hause des Somatrinkers”). I take it as referring to the unexpressed agent of sutā́saḥ santu “let them be pressed,” namely us.
