With Sāy. and Re but contra Ge, I consider the father and mother of pāda a to be Heaven and Earth, matching that same pair in d. The reference is to the earthly and heavenly soma of 4a and b, which “sound in unison,” though also including the priest-poets, as disc. in the publ. intro. They marshall their joint power, embodied in the māyā́associated with Varuṇa, against those “without commandments” (avratā́n); vratá- are of course esp. associated with Varuṇa, and by virtue of their presence in both heaven and earth can banish enemies from both places.

Note the return of √dham ‘blow’ from 1a. In its earlier occurrence this root simply expressed the action of the drop (drapsásya dhámataḥ), but here the verb has been weaponized, as it were, against enemies.
