The formation of dharṇasí- is unclear; AiG II.237 classifies it as having the almost unparalleled suffix -así-, and if it is formed to √dhṛ, as seems likely, the intrusive -n- is another problem (though cf. RV hapax dharṇí-). The -n- could perhaps be gotten from an extreme reduction of the -man-stem(s) dharmán- / dhárman-, but the rest is hard to generate.

The function of the word in its pāda is also unclear, as there is no obvious neut. for it to modify. (This adj. is otherwise always masc. and generally modifies soma, which does not help here.) I take the two syntactically parallel pādas a and b as each incomplete, to be completed by the other. In other words, I supply neut.

cakṣaṇam from b in a, and the neut. adj. dharṇasí from a in b.

The publ. tr. fails to tr. vaḥ in a, so modify the tr. to “Is your (vision) of truth steadfast?” This helps solve one of the small puzzles of the verse: given Varuṇa in b and Aryaman in c, we might expect Mitra in a -- but instead we have “you,” as in 5c, referring to the gods in general. As for the larger meaning of the questions, it may be that the poet is asking whether rt̥á is always the same (= pūrvyám r̥tám of 4c and pratnā́... ā́hutiḥ of 5d) or whether the gods change the rules on us.
