The adj. rabhasá- ordinarily characterizes action (‘violent, frenzied’), but here must have a visual aspect. So also III.31.12. Such synaesthesia is not uncommon in the RV.

In d all standard tr. supply ‘they’ [=Maruts] as subject of (vy ánu) dhire, with śríyaḥ as object (e.g., Ge “… haben sie ihre Herrlichkeiten entfaltet”). This amounts to a change of person, for these same tr. identify the many good things of a-c as ‘yours’ [=Maruts], following similar statements in vs. 9 with vaḥ (a, cd). Though there are no overt 2nd ps. pronouns in vs. 10, the voc. marutaḥ in pāda shows that 2nd ps. reference continues in this verse. Rather than changing person in d, I see another ex. of case disharmony between frame and simile, which is facilitated by the middle voice of dhire. The simile váyo ná pakṣā́n “like birds their wings” uses the middle in transitive but self-involved sense, but, in my reading, in the frame dhire is intransitive, with śríyaḥ as subject. I must admit, however, that the person switches to 3rd in vs. 11, so that a switch here in the last pāda of 10 is not impossible. I prefer my interpr., with constant 2nd ps. in vs. 10, both because -- all things being equal -- it’s best to keep verses self-contained and, more important, because Agastya likes doing tricky things with similes.
