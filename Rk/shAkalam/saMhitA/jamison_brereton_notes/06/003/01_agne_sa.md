The standard tr. take ṭe with jyótiḥ, i.e., “your light.” Because of its somewhat unusual pāda-final position, however, I construe it rather with immediately preceding devayúṣ “seeking you as god.” The retroflexion in devayúṣ ṭe might have been interpr.

as an indication of constituency and therefore as support for my interpr., but this argument does not hold. For retroflexion of te after a rukified or -fiable -s, cf. I.11.6, 7 (I.131.4, IV.42.7) vidúṣ ṭe, I.48.6 (I.69.7, VIII.24.17) nákiṣ ṭe, I.104.1 (VII.24.1) yóniṣ ṭe, IV.4.3 (VIII.71.8) mā́kiṣ ṭe, IV.10.4 ābhíṣ ṭe, V.38.1 uróṣ ṭe, VI.44.11 (VIII.40.9) pūrvī́ṣ ṭe, VII.3.4 prásitiṣ ṭe, VII. 18.18 rāradhúṣ ṭe, VIII.14.3 dhenúṣ ṭe, VIII.17.6 svādúṣ ṭe, VIII.44.23 syúṣ ṭe, IX.104.4 góbhiṣ ṭe, X.33.7 pitúṣ ṭe, X.38.3 asmā́bhiṣ ṭe, X.56.2 tanū́ṣ ṭe, X.85.40 agníṣ ṭe, X.112.1 ukthébhiṣ ṭe.

Counterexamples: I.80.8 bāhvós te, I.147.2 vandā́rus te, I.163.3 āhús te, III.55.22 niṣṣídhvarīs te, IV.12.1 trís te, IX.79.5 āvis te, IX.86.5 prabhós te [VII.99.7 váṣaṭ te].

In other words, retroflexion is the most common outcome of te after a word ending with a ruki-fiable s, though it is not without exception. Constituency does not seem to play a role, nor (though this is not clear from the examples just assembled) does metrical position: all of the non-rukified examples occur first in their pādas, but rukified examples occur in every sort of metrical position, including, regularly, initial in pāda. See also the data on retroflexion discussed just above ad VI.2.6.

In the 2nd hemistich áṃhaḥ is the most problematic form. In the syntagm pā́si … mártam áṃhaḥ we should like an ablatival reading: “you protect the mortal from narrow straits.” There are several ways to achieve this reading or to configure the form in a syntactically different way. For general disc. of this problem see Old, ZDMG 55: 280-81, and Schindler, Root noun, pp. 10-11. Gr (fld. by Kuiper IIJ 1: 49 [1957]) invents a root noun áṃh- for just this passage, beside the very wellattested s-stem áṃhas-, to which our form could be the abl. Although this solves the immediate problem, inventing a stem for a single occasion otherwise has little to recommend it, and we should in any case expect accent on the ending, *aṃháḥ.

Others take it as an abl. to the s-stem, truncated in some way and at some period. M.

Hale (Fs. Melchert) sees it as an archaic zero-grade abl. to the s-stem, preserved from a pre-proto stage of IE -- though he otherwise sets forth quite cogently the arguments against positing the preservation of such archaisms. Wackernagel (AiG III.80) interprets it as a haplology from *áṃhasaḥ, an ad hoc solution that again solves the problem, but rather crudely. Schindler, flg. an oral suggestion of Hoffmann’s (in turn fld by Scar 135, 300), takes it as the acc. it appears to be, governed by a participle to be supplied (he suggests ā́√ṛ, on the basis of V.31.13): “den Sterblichen, den du, O Gott, beschützt, wenn er durch Verlassenheit in Bedrängnis (gerät).” This again takes care of the form, but requires supplying material from nowhere.

I also am inclined to take it as an acc., but not via the same mechanism as Schindler (/Hoffmann), but by way of syntactic ambiguity plus metrical convenience.

I start with the fact that 1) abl. áṃhasaḥ is common with √pā, often final in a Jagatī cadence; in this cycle cf. VI.16.30, 31 (though these two are actually in dimeter cadences) … pāhy áṃhasaḥ#. 2) Another, semantically similar, expression involves áṃhas- and (ví) √muc ‘release’, but this expression can have two different syntactic realizations: personal ACC. + ABL. of the danger, or ACC of danger + personal ABL.

Cf., e.g., I.118.6 ámuñcatam vártikām áṃhaso níḥ “you two released the quail from áṃhas-” versus II.28.6 (etc.) vatsā́d ví mumugdhy áṃhaḥ “release áṃhas- from the calf.” The same duality of construction is found with √pṛ ‘carry across, rescue’. Cf. in the next hymn VI.4.8 párṣy áṃhaḥ “carry (us) across narrow straits” versus VII.16.10 tā́n áṃhasaḥ piprhi ̥ “rescue them from narrow straits.” I suggest that here we have a blend of these constructions extended to semantically similar √pā. The person remains in the ACC., but the danger is put into the ACC. as well. The similarity of the expression here … pā́si … áṃhaḥ# and, in the next hymn, VI.4.8 párṣi áṃhaḥ# may have contributed. And I don’t think we should discount metrical convenience: the expected abl. áṃhasaḥ is fine for a Jagatī cadence but doesn’t fit a Triṣṭubh cadence like this one, whereas áṃhaḥ is quite common in Triṣṭubh cadences.

So if the poet can find a syntactically principled way to use acc. áṃhaḥ here, he will — and, in my opinion, he did. Note also áṃho mártam in the next vs. (2d), the same words in opposite order to our mártam áṃhaḥ, as well as áṃhaḥ in the previous hymn, VI.2.4.

A less pressing problem is how to construe the instr. tyájasā. In the Hoffmann/Schindler interpr., it is simply construed with the invented participle: “wenn er durch Verlassenheit in Bedrängnis (gerät).” Both Ge and Re take it as the cause leading to áṃhaḥ, e.g., Ge “… vor Not infolge einer Unterlassungssünde,” but Ge suggests in a n. (1) that it could be an instr. of accompaniment with áṃhaḥ (“vor Not und Sünde”). That is the tack I adopt here, but I consider tyájas- as something that might befall the hapless mortal rather than something he might commit (like Sünde) and bring about his bad fortune. On the semantics of tyájas- here and elsewhere in the RV, see Old, ZDMG 55.280-82.
