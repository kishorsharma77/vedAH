máhikeru- is a hapax of unclear meaning. Mayrhofer (EWA s.v. máhikeruand céru-) plausibly suggests a connection with √ci ‘observe, take note’; so also Old.

Its apparent structural similarity to mahivrata in 3c might invite a complementary semantic analysis.

The etymological figure śukréṇa śocíṣā is not rendered so in English because “blazing blaze” strikes me as limp.
