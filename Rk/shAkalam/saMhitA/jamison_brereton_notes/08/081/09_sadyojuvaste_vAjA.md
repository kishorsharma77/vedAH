Ge, Mayr (PN), followed by Klein (DGRV I.104) and Scar (175), take váśaiḥ as a PN (“by the Vaśas”). This is possible but not necessary; as Ge (n.) reports, Sāy takes it in its usual sense, as I do.

The verb jarante is taken by Gotō (150) to ‘awaken’, an interpretation I follow. Although the notion of prizes “awakening” may seem strange, since the Dakṣiṇā is distributed at the dawn sacrifice, it makes ritual sense. Others (Ge, Klein, Scar) take it rather to ‘sing’, but this requires the form to be passive (Klein “and in the morning are sung of by the Vaśas”; Ge’s tr. is actually a “‘Kompromiss’- Übersetzung,” in Gotō’s phrase [150 n. 226] “… werden … wachgesungen,” incorporating both ‘wake’ and ‘sing’, but still as a passive). However, járate ‘sing’ is always active in value.

I take ca in c as inverse “X ca Y” connecting the two adverbials; Ge, Klein as connecting the two clauses, ab and c.
