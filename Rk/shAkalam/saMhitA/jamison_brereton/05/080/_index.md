Dawn
Satyaśravas Ātreya
6 verses: triṣṭibh
Although this hymn is attributed to the same poet as V.79 by the Anukramaṇī, it is  entirely different in tone. Dawn’s association with wealth is mentioned in verse 3,  but the focus is first on her journey (vss. 1–3) and then, in the second half of this  brief hymn (vss. 4–6), on the beauty of her body as it is slowly revealed in the grow
ing light, in images of delicate sensuality.
Each verse but the first begins with the emphatic pronoun eṣā́ “she,” and there is  no doubt that “she” is all that matters in the hymn.
