Agni
Budha Ātreya and Gaviṣṭhira Ātreya
12 verses: triṣṭubh
The hymn describes the kindling and birth of Agni in the morning rite. In the  middle section of the hymn, the poet links verses by repeating an image from the  second hemistich in the opening hemistich of the next verse. So in 4d and 5a Agni  as a horse is born “at the beginning of days,” although in verse 4 this may be Agni  as the sun, while in verse 5 Agni is clearly the sacrificial fire. Note the difference in  color: the horse is “gleaming” or “white” in verse 4, but “ruddy” in verse 5. The  poet almost repeats 5d in 6a, except that he has shifted the tense in 6d to a more dis
tant past indicating the passage of time between the verses. More loosely, in 6c Agni  is a sage poet (kaví) and in 7a an “inspired” poet (vípra). In 7d the priests “groom”  (mr̥janti) Agni, imagined as a horse, and in 8a “fit to be groomed, he is groomed”  (mārjālyò mr̥jyate). In 8d Agni is ahead (prá √as) of other fires and in 9a he goes  ahead (prá √i) of other sacrificers. Though a common metaphor, the image of Agni as a horse or a chariot-driver  is treated with originality. Most strikingly, in verse 3, instead of the priests awaken ing Agni, Agni awakens the hymn, “the bridle” (raśanā́) of the horse that pulls the  chariot, the sacrifice itself, while the dakṣiṇā, the sacrificial reward to the priests, is  the horse. The end of the verse shifts to the metaphor of Agni as a growing child.  The word for “tongues” of flame, juhū́, can also mean a sacrificial ladle, and this  ambiguity is the basis for the ellipsis of the noun.
