On the loc. camū́see AiG III.188.

V.51.5-10: These next 6 vss. are in Uṣṇih, divided into 3 (vss. 5-7) and 3 (vss. 8-10) by their refrains: abhí práyaḥ# of 5-7 and the full-pāda ā́yāhy agne atrivát suté raṇa of 8-10. In fact vss. 8-10 are rigidly -- and boringly -- structured, with each of the first two pādas containing a form of sajū́ḥ ‘jointly’ and as many god-name instrumentals as can be fit in.
