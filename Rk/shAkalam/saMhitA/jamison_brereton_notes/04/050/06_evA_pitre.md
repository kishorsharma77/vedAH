As indicated in the publ. intro., this is the final vs. of the 1st section of the hymn and has the standard marks of a hymn-final summary vs. It is the best evidence that vss. 1-6 were a separate composition, only secondarily amalgamated with the following two sections. Nonetheless, I think it simply marks a pause and a transition to the thematically contrastive next section.
