Indra
Krṣ̥ ṇa Āṅgirasa
11 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, jagatī 4–9, triṣṭubh 10–11
This last in the trio of Kr̥ṣṇa Āṅgirasa’s Indra hymns shares its final two verses  (10–11) with the previous two hymns, though it otherwise has little in common with  them. The hymn bristles with difficulties in the details, but its overall trajectory is  clear: it is a journey hymn, inviting Indra to drive to our sacrifice (vss. 1–3) to take  his place on the ritual ground and partake of our soma (vss. 4–5). The poet then  contrasts evil-minded non-sacrificers with their generous counterparts (vss. 6–7).  The poet gives a brief précis of the heroic deeds Indra accomplished in the past  after drinking soma (vs. 8), and in verse 9 urges Indra to defeat the poet’s enemies,  while making himself at home at the soma sacrifice.
