All Gods
Medhātithi Kāṇva
12 verses: gāyatrī
Though this hymn is dedicated to the All Gods, its focus is on Agni’s role in  conveying the gods to the sacrifice and serving as the mouth and tongue through  which they drink the oblations (see esp. vss. 7–8). The All God theme is cleverly  introduced in the first verse by parceling out the phrase “with all these gods,” a  word at the beginning of each pāda (an effect clumsily reproduced in transla
tion), and an enumeration of some of the most important of the gods is given  in verse 3, But otherwise (save for mention of Indra and Vāyu, the recipients  of the first soma offering, in vs. 10) the gods are an undifferentiated group and  backgrounded to Agni.
The poet does not forget his own, however. He mentions his kin-group, the  Kaṇvas, twice (vss. 2, 5) as the ritualists preparing the sacrifice.
