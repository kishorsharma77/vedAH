The image of the gods as soma-holding tubs returns here in d, but this time it is mediated through the image of them as the sea (samudráḥ) and therefore couched in the singular.

The d pāda is a repetition of 4d, save for the substitution of hávam for gíraḥ.

Such verbatim repetition of a full pāda within a hymn is very rare (save for refrains) and relatively rare even between two hymn -- again, in my view, an indication that the poet was not feeling particularly inspired.
