This vs. continues the syntactic frame of vs. 2, with the nom. pl. subj.

(“mortals” of 2d) modified by the pres. part. páśyantaḥ and Agni in the acc. sg.

vícetasam in pāda a is a pun, playing on the standard ambiguity of the root √cit, which means both ‘perceive’ and ‘appear’. Referring to Agni’s mental qualities, adjacent to ṛtā́vānam ‘truthful’, it means ‘discriminating’, but the simile in b, “like heaven with its stars,” actualizes the ‘appear’ sense.

The “laughter” of Agni is the merry crackling of the fire.
