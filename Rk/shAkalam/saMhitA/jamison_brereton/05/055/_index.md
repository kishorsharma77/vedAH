Maruts
Śyāvāśva Ātreya
10 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10
The first nine of the ten verses in this hymn end with a refrain, “as they drove in  beauty their chariots rolled along,” which sets the theme of the hymn. Rather than  focusing on the thunderstorm and its accompanying rain (mentioned only inciden tally in vs. 5), as in the last few Marut hymns, this one primarily concerns their  journey through the midspace. The hymn ends with a few verses (9–10) of invitation  to the sacrifice and prayers for benefits.
