Note the distinction in no. between the two 2nd ps. impvs. in ab: sg. úd īraya and pl. unátta. As commonly, the sg. is probably a self-addressed by the poet to himself; that his object is “the best poet of poets” (kavítamaṃ kavīnā́m) simply emphasizes the closed loop of reciprocity. The pl. impv. is presumably addressed to his fellow celebrants, in this case the priests charged with the physical activity (the Adhvaryu and his helpers, quite possibly). The pl. impv. unátta has a strong stem form where we properly expect weak, but the expected form *und-ta à *untta à (probably simplified to) *unta would have been difficult to parse.
