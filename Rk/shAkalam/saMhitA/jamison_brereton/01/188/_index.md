Āprī
Agastya Maitrāvaruṇi
11 verses: gāyatrī
Like the other nine Āprī hymns in the R̥gveda, this one treats a set series of sacrifi cial elements in a set order, using the same key words, italicized in translation. It is  not as bare-bones as some examples of the genre (such as I.14, the first in the text),  and phraseologically it closely resembles X.110.
