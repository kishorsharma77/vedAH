Dawn
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: triṣṭubh
This very brief hymn, a mere three verses, sketches the main outlines of Dawn’s  activities, though it has no space to elaborate: her connection with poets and the  morning ritual, her task of revealing the visible world and banishing darkness, and  her connection with the distribution of goods.
## 1
With their praises, with their hymns, the Vasiṣṭhas, inspired poets, have  awakened first in response to Dawn,
as she unrolls the two adjoining realms, revealing all the beings.
## 2
And she has awakened, having taken on new life, having hidden the  darkness with light—Dawn.
She goes in front, youthful and unabashed. She has brought to light the  sun, the sacrifice, the fire.
## 3
Let the Dawns, accompanied by horses, by cows, by heroes, dawn always  auspicious for us,
milking out ghee on all sides, teeming. – Do you protect us always with  your blessings.
