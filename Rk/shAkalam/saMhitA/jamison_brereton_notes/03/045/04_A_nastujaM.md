The simile in b is not clear, in great part because práti √jñā appears to be employed in some technical sense that we have no handle on. The lexeme is not common in Vedic and seems to mean ‘greet, welcome’ (or perhaps just ‘recognize, acknowledge’) in the Vāstoṣpati hymn, VII.54.1, and in other texts ‘acknowledge, respond’ vel sim. In post-Vedic Skt. it means ‘promise’ or the like. Since áṃśa- ‘portion’ may also have a technical or legal sense, this phrase may belong to a stratum of language that we have no access to at this period. My feeling is that it has to do with the acceptance or rejection of something offered, as prati √grah signals acceptance of a properly given gift (see Sac. Wife 199-201). But I cannot get further than that.
