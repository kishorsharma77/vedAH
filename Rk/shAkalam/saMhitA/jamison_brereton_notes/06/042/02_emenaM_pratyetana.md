As sometimes elsewhere (I.9.2, VIII.1.17, X.32.8), enam doubles īm in the phrase ém (that is, ā́+ īm) enam, a pile-up of two acc. enclitics, whose referent is postponed till the end of the hemistich, somapā́tamam. On this sequence see my RVic sīm and īm (2002), 302-3 and n. 18.

There is no obvious reason for the accent on pratyétana (Pp. praty étana).

(Old’s [ZDMG 60: 732] ref. is barely a mention and provides no real explanation.) The assumption about étana is that it is a 2nd pl. impv. of the root pres. of √i, with unexpected full grade of the root, unexpected verb accent in a main clause, and unexpected root rather than ending accent (versus itá, though of course the full grade would account for the root accent). I think rather that it should be analyzed ā́-itana, with accented preverb contracted with the unaccented expected zero-grade root syllable of the verb. We would thus have an unaccented verb as expected in this apparent main clause. But this suggestion raises two problems: 1) when two preverbs precede an unaccented verb, they should both be accented (though most the exx. I have identified have verbal material between the 1st and 2nd preverbs), e.g., IV.4.4 práty ā́tanuṣva, and we should therefore expect accented *práty here as well; 2) ā́is already present pāda-initially in ém. Balanced against these problems is the fact that ā́is usually the 2nd preverb in a complex (see práty-ā́√tan just cited), and the assumed ā́(…) práti would be quite unusual (almost no such sequences registered in MonWms). I think we must assume that, more or less simultaneously, ā́was doubled to serve as clitic host to īm in the frozen sequence ém enam, besides immediately preceding the verb, and that étana was reinterpr. as simply a full-grade accented impv. (cf. unaccented etana in V.61.4, on which see comm. ad loc.), not as containing a preverb — which reinterpretation then induced loss of accent on *práti.

The doubling of ā́is somewhat like the doubling of preverbs sometimes found in the Gāthās, though there that seems to be a redactional change.
