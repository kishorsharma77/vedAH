The overlapping identities of Agni and his worshiper are indirectly signaled in this vs. Although the sá of c must be correlative with yáḥ in a and refer to the human, some of the phraseology used of him in cd matches that used of Agni elsewhere. The common med. part. idhāná- is almost always intrans./pass. modifying Agni (‘[being] kindled’), but here it must be transitive with the worshiper as subject.

(There are a few other undoubted transitive occurrences: I.143.7, VII.9.6.) The combination of this participle and a form of púṣya- as here, with Agni as subj., is found in V.26.6 samidhānáḥ sahasrajid ágne dhármāṇi puṣyasi. Similarly sacate in d seems to match sácase at the end of the last hymn (IV.11.6), but Agni was the subject of that verb. The point here is that, though the second hemistich must in fact refer to the mortal worshiper, some of the phraseology invites a superimposition of Agni.
