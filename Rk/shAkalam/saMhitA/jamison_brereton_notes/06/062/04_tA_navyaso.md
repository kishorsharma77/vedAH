As noted ad vs 1., járamāṇa- here seems to belong to ‘sing’, not ‘awaken’, and therefore may limit the form in 1b as well. Based on 1b huve járamāṇaḥ “singing, I call upon” and 5b ā́vivāse “I seek to attract,” I have supplied a 1st ps.

referent for the genitives here. The bahuvrīhi yuyujāná-saptī ‘having a harnessed team, having a team that has been harnessed’ is unusual in having a middle pf. part. as its first member. (See AiG II.1.43.) The publ. tr. “having harnessed their team,” though it follows both Gr and Ge, is misleading: I do not think it is a bharád-vāja-, codayán-mati type governing cmpd. I would therefore emend to “having a harnessed team,” with the occasional pass. value of the med. pf. to √yuj; see Kü (407). However, things may be somewhat more complex. There are four occurrences of this med. part., one nearby in VI.59.5, three in the same metrical position as here (immed. after an opening of 5). All of them are transitive. It is possible that a free phrase like *yuyujānā́sáptī “the two having yoked their teams” became univerbated and reinterpreted, with adjustment of accent and the like. But I do not insist on this.

In d pratnáḥ ‘age-old’ qualifying the priest contrasts with návyas- ‘newer’ in a, qualifying the singer, as well as yúvānā ‘two youths’ in d referring to the Aśvins. The first pair recurs in the next vs., 5b. See comm. there. The “age-old Hotar” is of course Agni.
