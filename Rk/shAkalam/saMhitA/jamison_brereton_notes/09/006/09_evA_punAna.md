This vs. picks up various expressions from the hymn: índrayúḥ (pāda a) matches up with devayúḥ (1b) and asmayúḥ (1c), thus forming a slight ring. In b mádam … vītáye “(for Indra) to pursue exhilaration / the exhilarating drink” “repairs” the slightly anomalous mádam … kṣara in 2ab (see comm. there) and also echoes 6b mádāya devávītaye. I might therefore alter the tr. to “for him to pursue the exhilarating drink.” See also punānáḥ in pāda a, repeating the same part. in 4c.
