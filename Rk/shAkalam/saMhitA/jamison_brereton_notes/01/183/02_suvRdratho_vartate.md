Given its position, I do not think that ánu is a preverb in tmesis with tíṣṭhathaḥ (with Gr and apparently Ge [/WG]), since such preverbs usually move to a metrical boundary (or directly after the verb). Re suggests that we should supply vratā́ni, after ánu vratā́ni in 3b, but doesn’t provide a tr. or give any indication of what the whole would mean. However, I think his instinct is correct, that ánu implicitly governs an acc. with the meaning “following/according to X.” The X is, in my view, to be found in krátu-mant- ‘having resolve’; the construction is a blend of this possessive adj. and an underlying ánu *krátum (cf. VIII.63.5, though the phrase is not as common as I’d expected). Pāda-final pṛkṣé is infinitival, like iṣayádhyai in 3c.
