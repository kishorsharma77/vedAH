The exact sense of the hapax pūrṇávandhura- ‘having a full chariot box’ is not entirely clear. Ge suggests that it is full either because Indra has drunk so much or because he is taking Opfergabe home with him; Re goes for the latter: “plein (de biens).” This seems unlikely, since Indra is supposed to bring goods to distribute to us, not take them away with him like party favors. Moreover the vandhúra- appears to be the place where the charioteer stands (cf. the cmpd vandhureṣṭhā́-, as well as I.139.4, III.14.3), not a container for cargo. Although a jocular interpretation like Ge’s is possible, I wonder if a “full chariot box” is simply one that has the driver in it; in other words, Indra has mounted the chariot and is ready to go. In any case, pūrṇá- here has to be read in the context of the same word in the next verse.
