Although Ge gives up on the cmpd. pratádvasū, which modifies hárī, Old plausibly suggests that it’s a univerbation of the frequent collocation prá tád “forth to that” or perhaps prá tád vásu “forth to that good thing,” perhaps as the actual command Indra “cries out” to the horses. Rendering it in English is somewhat clumsy.
