The array of tenses in this verse requires comment. The subordinate-main clause dyad of ab/c contains an imperfect ávartayat in the yád clause and a present dhatté (dhattá in sandhi) in the main clause. Pāda d, which describes actions that necessarily follow the one in pāda c, then has two imperfects (áhan and aubjat). I consider the imperfect / present combination in the first sentence to be a makeshift attempt to convey anteriority in a language without a semantic pluperfect. That is, there is no structural means in Rigvedic Sanskrit to convey past anterior action (“when he had X-ed, he Y-ed”) via a finite verb (though see recent work by IH with a contrary opinion), since the “pluperfect” is simply the past tense to presential perfects. In later Sanskrit the gerund serves as a non-finite way to express the value (“having X-ed, he Y-ed”), but the gerund barely exists in the RV. In the RV the perfect participle does serve this function, in contrast to finite forms of the perfect system. Here the relative tense values are conveyed by the imperfect followed by the present, since the imperfect does express action prior to that of the present tense. The imperfects in pāda d then re-establish the past-time context. I therefore tr. the imperfect and present of abc with the English pluperfect and preterite.
