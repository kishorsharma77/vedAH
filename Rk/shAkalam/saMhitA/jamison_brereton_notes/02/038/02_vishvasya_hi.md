The hapax nímṛgra- must clearly be a derivative of ní √mṛj, lit. ‘wipe down’, but generally either ‘clasp to oneself’ or idiomatically ‘drag down’ (for the latter see I.140.2, V.52.17). The context here requires something like ‘submissive’, as all tr.

take it. See comm. ad VII.26.3, which suggests that forceful dragging down implies coercion by the agent and, conversely, submission (voluntary or not) of the object.

Note also that it has an unetymological velar g, presumably extracted from forms where the final palatal j, followed by s-, yields -kṣ-.

The submission of the waters and, especially, the quieting of the wind probably reflect the natural fact that the wind tends to drop at dusk, and this brings about calming of waves that had been raised by the wind.
