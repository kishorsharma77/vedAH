The third pāda of this vs., which is the 2nd vs. in the tṛca addressed to Sarasvant, the masc. equivalent of the far more prominent Sarasvatī, parallels that of the 2nd vs. in the tṛca addressed to Sarasvatī that opens this hymn: 2c sā́no bodhi avitrī́marútsakhā 5c tébhir no avitā́bhava Re suggests that this parallelism attests to the secondary character of Sarasvant. The difference between the two impvs. bodhi and bhava, both to √bhū, conforms to the positional distribution of these two forms discussed in my 1997 “Syntactic constraints on morphological change: The Vedic imperatives bodhi, dehi, and dhehi” (Syntaxe des langues indo-iraniennes anciennes, ed. E. Pirart).
