The verb veṣi can be either a 2nd sg. indic. pres. or a si-impv. to √vī ‘pursue’. (See, e.g., the distribution as given by Lub 1330 and 1331; Lub takes this occurrences as an indic.) Ge tr. it as an indic., Re as an impv., and the publ. tr. takes it as an indicative present. Contextually I would (weakly) prefer the imperative, and the undoubted si-imperative sátsi found in 10b might support this interpr. But I am not certain that si-imperatives take ná as negative rather than mā́. Given their derivational status as haplologized s-aor. subjunctives, ná should be quite correct, but they have generally transferred functionally into the imperative domain and so might be expected to take mā́, however anomalously. I know of no diagnostic passages.

The voc. ‘o Jātavedas’ was carelessly omitted from the publ. tr.
