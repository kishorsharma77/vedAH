I am not certain what the simile depicts, what it means for a horse to “step beyond the chariot-pole (dhúr-).” Re suggests that the dhúr- is being used here as a pole to mark the limit of the racecourse, but I do not know of another example of dhúr- in this sense. It’s possible that the simile depicts the moment when, as a horse is starting to pull a chariot, it's been hanging back from its tackle and now it pulls on it and pushes beyond it, but my ignorance about the interaction between horses and their tackle makes this interpr.

uncertain. Note also that dhúram here phonetically echoes dúraḥ ‘doors’ in 3c.
