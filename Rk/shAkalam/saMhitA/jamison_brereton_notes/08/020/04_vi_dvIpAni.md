The vs. describes the effects of the monsoon. The first hemistich contains three injunctives (pā́patan, tíṣṭhat, and yujanta) and the last pāda a present (éjatha), but pāda c contains the apparently augmented airata. Given this collection of verbs, it is difficult to produce a consistent temporal interpretation. The injunctives can harmonize either with the preterital airata or with the presential éjatha, but those two are incompatible. A way out of this dilemma was shown by Hoffmann (Injunc, 210), who suggests that the “cacophonous hiatus” dhánvāni *īrata was avoided by substituting the augmented form for the injunctive. (It would be good to have other exx. of such a hiatus-avoiding technique, however.) The whole verse can then be interpr. as presential or “general.” This temporal value continues in vs. 5, also describing the effects of the storm, with two present-tense verbs.

The second clause in pāda a, tíṣṭhad duchúnā, has been interpreted in two opposing senses. Ge supplies the ví of the first VP and tr. “das Unheil breitet sich aus.” But without the ví the verb would mean ‘stand (still)’ or ‘stop’ (so Re “stoppe le misère”). I favor this latter interpretation. Since the monsoon brings desired rain, which makes the plants grow and produces food and attendant well-being, it stops misery in its tracks, as it were. This stoppage contrasts with the movement of the features of the natural world in pādas a and c.
