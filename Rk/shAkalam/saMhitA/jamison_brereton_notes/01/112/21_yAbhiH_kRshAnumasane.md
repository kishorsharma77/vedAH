Pāda c presents a major disruption of the pattern that has monotonously structured this hymn since vs. 5; this disruption may signal the approaching end of the hymn. Unlike every c-pāda in the hymn (starting indeed with vs. 1) save for the immediately preceding one, the pāda doesn’t begin with yā́bhiḥ (11c doesn’t actually begin with yā́bhiḥ, but it is found within the pāda). Moreover the verb bharathaḥ is not accented and therefore cannot be in even a notional relative clause, despite the yád that immediately follows it. Curiously, most interpr. ignore or explain away these deviations. Ge. tr. as a “wenn” clause and considers yád “Attraktion für yā́bhiḥ” (attraction to what he doesn’t say). Old ascribes yád for yā́bhiḥ to metrical needs and wishes to accent bharathaḥ, because switching to a main clause is “recht unwahrscheinlich.” Since the poet clearly had no problem maintaining his template in verse after verse, I find it impossible to believe that the departures from this structure here are not deliberate -- a kind of putting on the brakes before the end, just as the full template took awhile to take shape at the beginning of the hymn. More recent tr. reflect the verse’s structure better: WG make c a parenthetical clause (though, oddly, repeating the “attraction” explan. in the n.); Scar (p. 444) also treats the clause as parenthetical.

The formally ambiguous saráḍbhyaḥ is taken by Ge (/WG) as dative, but given real-world knowledge -- bees produce honey and don’t need it brought to them

-- it surely makes better sense as an ablative (so also Lü., Scar.), in what looks almost
like an izafe construction: yát saráḍbhyaḥ.
