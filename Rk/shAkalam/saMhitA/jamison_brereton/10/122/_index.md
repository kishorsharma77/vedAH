Agni  
Citramahas Vāsiṣṭha  
8 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 1, 5  
Attributed to a Vasiṣṭhid by the Anukramaṇī, this hymn ends (vs. 8) with a men tion of the Vasiṣṭhas and with the Vasiṣṭha refrain from Maṇḍala VII. It is a fairly  standard praise of Agni, deploying a wide range of his standard epithets and ritual  roles and titles. The ritual is the complete focus of the hymn, and the rewards that  the sacrificer will receive from properly performing it and serving Agni are also at  the forefront. There is much recycling of vocabulary.
