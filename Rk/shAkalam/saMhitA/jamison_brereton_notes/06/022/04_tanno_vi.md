Although there is no overt mark, I take initial tán no ví vocaḥ as a question (contra Ge), matching the overt questions in cd and introducing the indirect question in the yádi clause; see also prchántī in the next vs. and the questions in the previous hymn, VI.21 3-4, 6).

The poet seems to be harking back to vs. 2 in 4ab and vs. 3 in 4cd. In vs. 2 the ancestral poets praised Indra, but the god is described as nakṣad-dābhá- ‘outwitting the one(s) approaching’. Here the poet asks if previous singers obtained (ānaśúḥ) Indra’s favor. Although this pf. belongs to the root √(n)aś ‘attain, reach’, which is synchronically separate from √nakṣ ‘approach’, the latter root is a fairly transparent enlargement or development of the former (see EWA s.v. NAŚ1 , p. 28; Narten, SigAor. 160, Gotō, 1st Kl., 192), and, of course, some forms of √(n)aś have the root syllable nakṣ (e.g., desid. ínakṣati, though see íyakṣati in the previous hymn, VI.21.3). I therefore suggest that ānaśúḥ implicitly responds to nakṣat- in 2c. With my new (and, I hope, more accurate) interpr. of nakṣad-dābhá- in 2c, I now think that vs. 2 implies that Indra may deviously rebuff the attentions of his praisers and have done so even to the legendary poets of the past. Here the poet directly asks the question if these previous poets (/singers) actually obtained (ānaśúḥ) the favor they sought in approaching (nakṣat-) Indra, whose benevolence cannot be taken for granted.

In the 2nd hemistich the questions turn to Indra’s portion (bhāgá-) and his vital energy (váyaḥ) in battle, but also refers to the wealth he may bring. The two cmpds púruhūta purūvaso respond to puruvī́rasya .. purukṣóḥ in 3d.

The voc. khidvaḥ, presumably to a -vant-stem *khídvant- (AiG II.2.896, or, less likely, *khídvan- or *khidvāṃs-), belongs to the synchronic root √khid, which, despite its relative rarity, displays a variety of senses centered around aggressive action. Since this stem is a hapax, it’s difficult to know which of the senses is reflected here; Gr renders as ‘drängend (so also EWA s.v. KHED), bedrängend, Ge ‘Abzwacker’. The only RVic nominal form to this root is khédā (3x), which in its clearest occurrence (VIII.76.3) means ‘hammer’ or the like. I have evoked this sense here, in the English idiom ‘hammer-head’, thus forming an unjustified etym. figure in tr. “headstrong hammer-head” -- ‘headstrong’ representing dudhra. Although the standard tr. are safer, the fact that the form is a hapax to a poorly attested root invites a more noticeable tr. than ‘pressing’.

I follow W. E. Hale (Ásura-, 65) in taking asura- in asurahán- as referring to human ‘lords’ who lead forces inimical to us.
