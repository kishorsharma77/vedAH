As in several instances in the last few hymns, WG impose extra structure on the first hemistich that is not supported by the phraseology. They supply a verb to govern śravā́yyam, which then forms the foundation for a 2nd subordinate cl.

consisting of íṣam … dadhiṣé: “Was du … Ruhmvolles (zustande gebracht), dass du dir die Labung … verschafft hast.” In their introduction to the hymn they explain what lies behind this interpr., adding even further unsupported assumptions. The ‘praiseworthy’ thing that Indra accomplished was his action of freeing the life-giving liquid (íṣ-), which they presumably take both as the waters imprisoned by Vṛtra and (proto-)rain. But they give no justification for dividing ab into two clauses, separating the apparently parallel objects śravā́yyam and íṣam, and providing a verb to govern the first that cannot be generated from context or formulaics. It is worth pointing out that śravā́yya- is never used of a deed or action and most often modifies rayí- ‘wealth’ or vā́ja- ‘prize’. Although I can’t see any obstacle to qualifying a deed as śravā́yya-, there are no familiar phrases containing that notion that would come to mind when encountering an undefined śravā́yya-. Though I confess I can’t identify the referent(s) here, I find the WG interpr. implausible and forced. For further on this vs. see comm. ad V.39.2 below.
