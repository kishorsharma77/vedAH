The sole Anuṣṭubh verse in a sea of Gāyatrīs. Note that it is the last vs. before the Agni tṛca, and so it may function as a closing or pseudo-closing vs., dividing the larger hymn into parts.

The first hemistich has received a variety of interpr., splitting into two major camps dependent in great part on the identity of sū́raḥ. Ge (see his n. 18ab), Re, Ober (I.494) take it as a gen. sg. of svàr-, one of a string of gen. dependent on sātā́‘at the winning’ - hence, “at the winning of the sun, refreshment, offspring, and bodies.” There are several arguments against this interp., however: 1) sū́raḥ has to be nom. sg. to sū́ra- in 22c, and so consistency would be nice (if not entirely necessary); 2) íṣaḥ has the wrong accent for gen. sg. (expect iṣáḥ); 3) the standard interpr. of the sequence éṣaḥ is ā́íṣaḥ (already Pp., though see other poss. in Ge’s n. 18ab), but the mid-pāda location of ā́, between two supposedly parallel genitives, is an odd position for a preverb / adposition / adverb, and it has no obvious function in the clause. In fact the clause has no verb and no obvious one to supply - witness the variety of suggestions: Ge “(stehst uns),” Re “(qui t’es préparé),” Ober “(hilfst uns).” I therefore follow the path generally sketched by Old (see also Lü 267 n. 4): a nominal equational cl. with nom. sg. sū́raḥ to sū́ra- (note that both Gr and Lub so list the form), tváṃ soma sū́raḥ “you, Soma, are the sun”; followed by a 2nd cl. beginning with ā́. Though ā́ remains mid-pāda, it is initial in its clause, as we would expect. An imperative of bringing / giving / suppying needs to be supplied, with acc. pl. íṣaḥ (properly accented) as obj. Cf. expressions like III.53.1 ... íṣa ā́vahatam ..., VI.52.16 ... íṣa ā́dhattam, and, with specifically Somian vocab., nearby IX.65.13 ā́... íṣam pávasva “By purifying yourself, bring refreshment here.” More to the point, perhaps, the immediately following vs., 19b, ā́ suvórjam íṣaṃ ca naḥ “impel hither nourishment and refreshment to us,” is quite similar and could provide the missing verb.

A structurally less crucial question is the relationship between the two genitives in b, tokásya … tanū́nām. As indicated above, Ge takes them as parallel; Re by contrast takes tanū́nām as a beneficial “pour nous-mêmes,” independent of the genitives dependent on sātā́. In the publ. tr. I take them as nested, with tanū́nām dependent on tokásya, though I have no particular objection to the parallel interpr.

As noted above, vṛṇīmáhe sakhyā́ya is a permutation of 14c sakhitvám uśmasi.

On vṛṇīmáhe yújyāya, see comm. ad IX.88.1. Given the other exx. of this lexeme, I would now alter the tr. to “we choose you for yoking [/use].”
