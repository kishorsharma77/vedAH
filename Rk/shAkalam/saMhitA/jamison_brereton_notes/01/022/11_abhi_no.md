The goddesses “with unclipped wings” (áchinnapatra-) are found only here in the RV, but appear in a set of YV mantras used in the Agnicayana at the placing and heating of the ukhā pot (for firing the bricks). See VS XI.61, MS II.76, KS XVI.6, ŚB VI.5.4.8, etc. A number of other female divinities are mentioned in the same context. What áchinnapatra- actually refers to is unclear to me. Griffith (ad VS XI.61) suggests “moving freely and without interruption.” It mightb evoke the myth of the originally winged mountains, whose wings Indra clipped so that they would settle down. But the mountains are masculine fitures. I also do not see any sign of the later Agnicayana employment here, simply an association with other female divine figures.
