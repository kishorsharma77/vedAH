The first two pādas of this vs. vary and further specify the opening image in vs. 1 út te śúṣmāsa īrate, with the same verbal lexeme though no longer in tmesis (prasavé ta úd īrate#) and the identification of the sound that rises as “three voices” (tisró vā́caḥ). The loc. prasavé ‘at your stimulus’ can also be seen as a semantic version of codayā ‘spur on’ in 1c.

The three voices, found also in this same context in IX.33.4, are either the voices of the three priests, Hotar, Adhvaryu, and Udgātar, or their three types of ritual speech, ṛc, yajus, and sāman.

Both Ge and Re take makhasyú- in the realm of gifts and bounty: “eine Gabe heischend” and “généreuses” respectively. I consider it a pun, referring both to combat and to bounty. Interestingly, for the most part within IX, derivatives of makhá- are associated with vā́c-: besides this one, IX.64.26 vā́cam … makhasyúvam and IX.101.5 vācás pátir makhasyate. Here it could refer to some sort of competition among the three voices/priests in addition to the association of ritual activity with bounties.
