The first three pādas are an esp. nice example of the syntactic complementarity between the tag-pāda c and what precedes. The subject and the verb are withheld until c (stómaḥ and babhūtu respectively), with the preverb determining the verbal lexeme (prá) and the possessive pronoun limiting the praise (vaḥ) found in the first pāda -- and the recipient agnáye the only thing held in common between ab and c. Thus neither ab nor c is complete in itself: their elements need to be intermingled to produce the full sense. The name of the recipient is also held until the end of the two-pāda opening, though prepared for by a series of datives.

Schaeffer (Inten. 114) argues persuasively that the intens. joguve is “lokaldistributiv” with the loc. phrase víśvāsu kṣā́su “in all lands.”
