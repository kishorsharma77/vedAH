ábhayāni in pāda a is the only neut. pl. to this stem. The idiom ábhayaṃ √kr̥ is quite common (and cf. abhayaṃ-kará- 1x). This idiom is formulaically connected with “broad pastures”; see esp. VII.77.4 urvī́ṃ gávyūtim ábhayaṃ krdh̥ ī naḥ “create broad pastureland and fearlessness for us” and nearby IX.78.5 urvī́ṃ gávyūtim ábhayaṃ ca nas krdhi ̥ “Make wide pasturage and security for us.” I have supplied ‘places’ because of the association with pasturage.

The apparent transitive value of sáṃ cikradaḥ … vā́jān “you have roared together prizes …” is anomalous, but hard to avoid. The idiom is similar to IX.64.3 … cakradaḥ …, sáṃ gā́ḥ … sa̐árvataḥ. See disc. ad loc. In that passage I found a way to avoid a transitive reading in the publ. tr., but in the comm. consider a transitive alternate. In our passage here the publ. tr. has a transitive reading, but it would also be possible to make maháḥ … vā́jān another object of síṣāsan and tr.

“Striving to win the waters, also the dawns, the sun, the cows, and great prizes, you have roared at them all together.” Note vā́jaṃ saniṣyán in 1b, and see the disc. ad vs. 1.
