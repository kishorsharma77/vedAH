Sarasvatı̄  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
14 verses: jagatī 1–3, gāyatrī 4–12, jagatī 13, triṣṭubh 14, organized in tr̥cas  
This hymn has a metrical structure similar to the preceding one, VI.60: it is orga nized in tr̥cas, with the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3) in a trimeter meter, the next three tr̥cas in  

dimeter (4–12), a return to the original meter in verse 13, and, here, a final verse (14)  in yet a different meter. The complexity of the meter corresponds roughly with the  density of the thought: the first tr̥ca is rich in imagery and particularities; the follow ing three tr̥cas are less adorned and more generic, though Sarasvatī’s riverine nature  is clear, especially in the second of these tr̥cas, verses 7–9. The hymn ends with a final  
statement of her superiority (vs. 13) and a plea for her aid and sustenance (vs. 14). The sheer power of the river and the potential menace of her relentless flow are  nicely conveyed, especially in the first tr̥ca, where she punishes a series of human  foes and even destroys the mountains while rewarding her praisers. In parts of the  hymn, these rewards are clearly related to her identity as river—the streambeds in  verse 3, the milk we pray for in verse 14—but in others the connection is not clear,  especially the gift to Vadhryaśva of (apparently) a son Divodāsa, which opens the  hymns. The hostile Br̥saya of verse 3 is also unclear: the name occurs only once  elsewhere in the R̥gveda (I.93.4) in similar context.
