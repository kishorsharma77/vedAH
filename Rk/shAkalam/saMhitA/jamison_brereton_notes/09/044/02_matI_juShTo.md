The stem juṣtá- with expected ppl. accent occurs only here in the RV, beside wellattested júṣṭa- with unexpected root accent. The latter form is generally construed with the dative of the beneficiary (“enjoyable to X”), save for the late X.125.5 (Vāc) júṣṭaṃ devébhir utá mā́nuṣebhiḥ (though this phrase has a traditional ring), with instr. as here.

The usual uncertainty about the root affiliation of hitá- in IX: to √hi ‘impel’ or √dhā ‘place’? See disc. ad IX.1.2, etc. On the basis of finite hinve in the next pāda, undeniably belonging to √hi, one could argue either way: as a root repetition or as a pun. Both Ge and Re take it to √hi, the latter with some disc. in his n.; I concur, primarily because of phrases like dhiyéṣitá- (I.3.5, III.12.1, 60.5, 62.12) ‘sent by the thought’, dhiyā́jūtá- (IX.64.16) ‘sped by the thought’, even though the doubling of ‘impelled’ seems crude for a RVic poet.

Ge and Re also construe víprasya with dhā́rayā (e.g., “grâce à la coulée du (prêtre)- inspiré”). In the publ. tr. I instead take it with the two types of speech in pāda a, matí- and dhī́- and assume that it has been displaced to c in order to contrast with kavíḥ, referring to Soma there. In favor of this interpr. is the fact that the very common instr. dhā́rayā generally appears alone and refers to the physical stream of the soma liquid, not metaphorically to words or the like. However, the identical pāda IX.12.8c gives me pause, as in that vs. there is no alternative way of construing víprasya except with dhā́rayā. I think it possible that IX.12.8 is a clumsy borrowing of this pāda, but see comm. ad loc., where I consider the possibility that there is a way to interpret víprasya dhā́rayā phrasally.
