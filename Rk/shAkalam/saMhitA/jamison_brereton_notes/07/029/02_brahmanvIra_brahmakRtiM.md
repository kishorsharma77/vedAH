The pāda-initial voc. bráhman shows the accent of the neut. bráhman- ‘formulation’, though it clearly belongs to the m. brahmán- ‘formulator’. The confusion is probably deliberate; the first word after the voc. phrase is bráhmakṛtim with the neut. 1st cmpd member, neut. pl. bráhmāṇi is found in pāda d, and note that the preceding hymn begins bráhmā (V.29.1a), with the neut. (see also V.29.2b).

Just as 1d is a variant of V.28.5ab, so also does 2b (arvācīnó háribhiḥ yāhi tū́yam) appear to play on V.28.1ab … úpa yāhi …, arvā́ñcas te hárayaḥ …, as well as echoing the immediately preceding vs. (29.1b ā́tu prá yāhi harivaḥ …) with háribhir yāhi tū́yam.
