For my tr. of vṛ́ṣamaṇas- see disc. of nṛmáṇas- in 5b.

Ge suggests that the greatness of the Maruts (pāda b) is demonstrated by the fact that Rodasī happily brings along their other lovers without jealousy. This seems like an interpretational male fantasy to me (though I realize that our poet is also male and therefore likely prone to the same fantasy). I have a much soberer and less entertaining interpr. based in ritual. In the plural, jánī- is regularly used of the wives of the gods, esp. in regard to their attendance at certain rituals. They are ordinarily brought by Tvaṣṭar, but here Rodasī, one of their own, as it were, seems to stand in as their chaperon and cicerone. In the Ṛtugraha offerings (the “sequential cups”), in which a fixed order of gods receives oblations, the offering to the Maruts is followed immediately by one to Tvaṣṭar along with the wives of the gods; see I.15.2-3, II.36.2-3 (II.36.3d tváṣṭar devébhir jánibhiḥ sumádgaṇaḥ). Thus, given the temporal proximity of the oblations made to them at this ritual, one might expect to find both the Maruts and the wives of the gods together on the ritual ground.

I do not understand the force of cid in d, and in fact I think it’s been automatically imported from the passages containing sthirā́cid where the adj. is a neut. pl. and the point is that our hero (whoever it happens to be) has destroyed various items “even though they are firm/hard” (I.127.4, IV.7.10, VIII.20.1). In other words, I do not think it has a function here.
