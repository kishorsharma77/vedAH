I am not sure of the exact nuance of √bhū + DAT. Gr takes it as meaning ‘angehören, eigen sein’, with a rare dat. here, instead of the gen. usual in this idiom (his no. 13). Ge renders it thus (“dir … haben wir uns zu eigen gegeben”). Even with the gen., Gr identifies very few passage with this value, and most of these should be otherwise interpr., and I also wonder about an augmented aor. in such a sense. The publ. tr. is by contrast “we have become ready for you,” and I think something like this is the intention (perhaps “we are here for you”). We are awaiting his advent at the ritual and the generosity he will display there, but there is some worry that he will fail to show up, as the 2nd clause of the 1st hemistich shows.

Note that the fairly rare root √ven appears here soon after the appearance of its deriv. venyá- in 8d. It is possible that this lexical association led to the grafting of this tṛca onto the previous one in this loose collection of short hymns.
