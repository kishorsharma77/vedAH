Agni  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
6 verses: triṣṭubh  
As often, the attempt to capture in words the actions of natural fire calls out the  best in the poet. The hymn has a skeleton of typical ritual description, especially  at the beginning, but this seems a simple and inert structure into which to insert a  series of increasingly contorted and fanciful images of fire.
