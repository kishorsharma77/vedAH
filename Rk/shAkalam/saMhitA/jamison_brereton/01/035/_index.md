Savitar (except Agni, Mitra and Varuṇa, Rātrī, and Savitar 1)  
Hiraṇyastūpa Āṅgirasa  
11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 1, 9  
After an initial verse invoking several gods, Savitar becomes the sole focus of the  hymn—Savitar primarily in his role as god of the evening, as was already suggested by the invocation of Night in verse 1c. The first part of the Savitar portion (vss.  2–5) describes the beauty of Savitar’s chariot and his journey through the night sky.  During this journey he (and his horses, vss. 2 and 5; see also 7–8) survey the crea tures and the larger cosmos in which they live, and in the second part of the hymn  (vss. 6–9) we learn what was seen. These verses enumerate the parts of the cosmos  and sketch its dimensions. This section is presented as mystical instruction (see esp.  vs. 6d), which raises cosmic questions (vs. 7cd), especially about what happens to  the sun during the night that Savitar is presiding over. The anxieties raised by the  absence of the sun are put to rest by Savitar’s ability to pervade the whole realm (vs.  9), and the hymn ends with an invitation to the god to come to us along his well  
maintained route through the midspace (vss. 10–11).
