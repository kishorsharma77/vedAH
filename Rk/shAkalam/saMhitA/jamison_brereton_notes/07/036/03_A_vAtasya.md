yájasva … devā́n. It is forms (both act. and mid.) compounded with ā́that acquire the meaning ‘obtain by sacrifice’. I therefore think the abstract qualities fellowship and vitality must be the objects of our sacrifice/worship, standing in for their divine possessor.

I take ṛtásya dhā́man “domain of truth” as referring to the ritual ground (as does Sāy.).

Ge’s tr. of bābadhe tentatively connects it with √bandh ‘bind’ (flg. Sāy.), not √bādh ‘(op)press’ (see his n. 5c). But √bandh otherwise lacks a pf. in the RV and beginning in the AV its weak forms have a base bedh-. The standard weak 3rd sg. pf.

to √bādh is babādhé; see Kü 330-31. Schaeffer (156) takes bābadhe as an intens.

pres., parallel to badbadhé with both following the standard perfect in function, and Kü (331; cf. also 488) seems to follow, though he takes badbadhé as an intensive perfect, distinguished from the present bābadhe. Since all these stems have a 3rd sg.

ending characteristic of the perfect, I consider at least bābadhe to be a straight perfect, with adjustment of the vowel length of redupl. and root syllable to conform better to such distribution elsewhere in the perfect system; cf. esp. vāvṛdhé versus vavárdha. The intens. badbadhé then adopted the inflectional patterns of the other two redupl. stems. As for what the verb means here, although ví √bādh generally has a negative sense ‘thrust away (undesirable things)’, here I think the same literal sense refers to the god’s pushing out towards us the pṛ́kśaḥ ‘fortifying nourishments’ we want in exchange for praise. Re (comm.) suggests a slightly different semantic pathway.
