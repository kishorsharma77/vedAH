A difficult verse with a discouragingly large number of competing interpretations. In outline, though not in detail, I follow Ge’s interpretation: pāda a concerns the production of poetry and the poetic vision by our side, in contrast to the poetic visions of the stranger, our rival, in b. After the stranger’s attempts are gotten rid of, the topic returns in cd to our poetic products, which have success. (WG basically follow Ge, while Old [SBE] and Re take b as coreferential with cd.) The first hemistich, esp. its first pāda, is highly alliterative and rhyming: dádhann ṛtáṃ dhanáyann asya dhītím, ā́d íd aryó didhiṣvò víbhṛtāḥ. The two parallel 3rd pl. verbs dádhan and dhanáyan technically do not match in mood, since dádhan should be a subjunctive (the injunctive to this redupl. pres. should be either

*dadhat or dadhur, and the subjunctive of the latter verb should be dhanáyān; see
Hoffmann 1967: 271 n. 13, who produces a tr. with subjunctive contrasting with preterite. However, in this context I think dádhan was created as a nonce injunctive to match the two an sequences in dhanáyan. The subjects of these verbs are simultaneously the Aṅgirases and the current poet-ritualists; the injunctive conveniently elides the difference between past and present action.

The beginning of b, ā́d íd, generally has temporal value (“just after that”) and is so tr. in the publ. tr. But Parāśara uses the expression in causal value in I.67.8 and I.68.3, and a causal value is possible in the next verse (71.4); such an interpretation works better here, and I would therefore change the tr. to “because of that …” The launching of their own poetic vision by our side scatters the visions of our opponents.

The sentiment, but not most of the vocabulary, echoes that in I.70.1, where the arí- is also the opponent.

The desid. adj. didhiṣú- to √dhā is based on the middle value of that root (‘acquire’); so Heenen p. 165, though I do not subscribe to the additional semantic baggage Heenen attaches to the stem. It means ‘desirous to acquire’, hence ‘greedy, voracious’. With most tr. I assume a pl. of dhītí- as the referent.

Just as the injunctives of pāda a can have either presential or preterital value, the lack of verb in b allows the temporal value to be set by the preceding clause, hence applicable both to the current ritual situation and its mythological model. The publ. tr. might be changed to “are/were dispersed.” There is no agreement on what víbhṛtra- means here, but ví √bhṛ generally means ‘disperse, pull apart, carry away’, and the form also needs to be considered in conjunction with víbhṛtaḥ in the next vs. The “unthirsting” dhītí- belonging to us/the Aṅgirases are implicitly contrasted with the voracious ones of the arí-, as Ge, etc., point out.

With Gr, Old, Re, I take apásaḥ as a nom. pl. fem.; Ge (/WG) rather as a gen. sg. masc. referring to the singer/priest. This is certainly possible and would provide a neat contrast to the gen. sg. aryáḥ of b. I would prefer, however, to keep the possible reference to the Aṅgirases alive. I would prefer not to take devā́n in d as a truncated gen. pl. construed with jánma (or as a second acc. with vardháyantīḥ “strengthening the gods, their race”); therefore, despite the pāda boundary, I take it with áchā, which frequently governs devā́n (so, apparently, also Re); cf. esp. I.132.5 (=139.1) devām̐áchā ná dhītáyaḥ, which is our underlying phrase.
