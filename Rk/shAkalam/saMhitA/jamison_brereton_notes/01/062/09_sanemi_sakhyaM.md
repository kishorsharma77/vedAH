Although the first hemistich is perfectly easy to tr., it is not at all clear what it is referring to. First, what is the “partnership” (sakhyám)? Ge thinks it is with the beings named in vss. 7-11, while Sāy thinks rather of the sacrificers. Nothing in the context helps to define what type of partnership it is or with whom, and the verb that governs it, “supported” (dādhāra), seems oddly chosen. The subject of this verb is also not fully identified: the larger context of course points to Indra, and sudáṃsāḥ ‘possessing very wondrous power’ was just used in 7c of Indra (where he was likewise the subject of a form of √dhṛ), and see dáṃsaḥ applied to his deed in 6b.

But who is he the “son” (sūnú-) of? and more to the point, the epithet śávasaḥ sūnúḥ “son of strength” is ordinarily Agni’s. Here we have the variant sūnúḥ … śávasā with instr., and sūnúḥ śávasā is used of Agni in I.27.2. On the other hand, śavasānáis twice use of Indra in the beginning of this hymn (1a, 2b) and śavasāvan in 11d, śavasāna in 13c; cf. also the clear śávasaḥ sūnúm índram in IV.24.1. I tentatively suggest that there is an attempt to blur the lines between Indra and Agni here, and that the partnership or fellowship may be the mutually beneficial relationship between gods and men centered on the sacrifice, where Agni officiates. But I cannot point to hard evidence for this interpretation.

The paradox of the cooked milk in the raw cows is a standard one, often trotted out as a natural wonder to contemplate. Here it seems to be taken further: there are literal milk and literal cows in c, but in d the black and red cows are likely to be the nights and dawns (as in 8cd) and the “gleaming white milk” the early light known as the “milk of the dawn cows” (see Watkins MoreDawnCows). As far as I can see, this hemistich has no integral connection with the first half of the verse, and the shift from 3rd to 2nd person underlines this disconnect.
