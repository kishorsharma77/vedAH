Sūrya
Abhitapas Saurya
12 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 10
Some of the themes sketched in X.35 are developed in this hymn into a more satis fyingly shaped composition. Though the hymns are not ascribed to the same poet,

the name of the supposed author of X.37, Abhitapas Saurya (“Scorching Heat, son  of the Sun”), is an artificial one, derived from the hymn’s subject matter. In X.35 the daily rising of the sun, expressed as a brief truth formulation  (X.35.8), was implicitly connected with the poet’s desire for “blamelessness” and for  the protection of the Ādityas, but these themes were scattered through the hymn,  which focused primarily on the early-morning sacrifice and the various gods associ ated with it. Here the Sun is primary, and his role as the eye of Mitra and Varuṇa,  and thus as the observer of mortals’ guilt or blamelessness, is announced at the  beginning (vs. 1a), and an expanded version of the truth formulation of X.35.8 is  found in the second verse.
The benefits the Sun brings to us and the regularity of his return form the sub ject of the middle part of the hymn. The connection between our moral behavior  and the Sun’s daily round is asserted again toward the end of the hymn (vs. 9),  which concludes (vs. 12) with a general expiation for faults unwittingly committed  and a scapegoating of our enemies.
