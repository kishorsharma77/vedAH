In d the utá is oddly positioned, since it appears to be meant to conjoin jāmī́m̐r ájāmīn “kin and non-kin,” there being no other likely candidates. Klein (DGRV I.356-57) calls it a “peculiar passage” and classes it with two other examples of what he schematizes as utá X Y (/ Z …). The pair jāmí- ájāmi- is several times asyndectic (I.111.3, IV.4.5, VI.44.17) as here, so no conjunction is actually necessary, but we can cite nearby VI.25.3 … jāmáya utá yé ‘jāmayaḥ, where the utá is correctly placed. Perhaps our passage is a blend of the asyndectic figure and the “X and which Y” construction in VI.25.3.
