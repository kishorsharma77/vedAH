The final pāda, with Soma (as a buffalo) vomiting (avamīt) ghee, takes one aback, esp. after the high-style extolling that has preceded it. Ge’s explanation, that “ghee” is a secret sacred word (“ein sakrales Geheimwort”) and Soma reveals it, may be correct. But the bluntness of the verb still surprises, and I am inclined to think something further is going on. There are only two verb forms to √vam in the RV, and the other one (váman X.108.8) also has speech as its object, but the evil Paṇis as subj.

Note that the Paṇis are found in vs. 4, as hiders of the ghee. Does our passage express some sort of rivalry between the two ritual substances? Or does it have to do with the Sautrāmaṇi ritual, meant to cure Indra after vomiting?
