mayobhúvā in pāda a repeats the same word in 9d, with śambhúvā in b generated as a variant to it.

Pāda d, gīrbhír vatsó ávīvṛdhat, is the third occurrence of this same pāda in this hymn (also 8d, 15b, except the verb in 8 lacks the accent). The instr. pl. dhītíbhiḥ at the end of c seems to double gīrbhíḥ, as śambhúvā does mayobhúvā in the first half-verse.
