With Gr, etc. (incl. Scar, p. 648) I take níṣṭhita- to √sthā + nís, not ní.

Ge seems to take paryáṣasvajat either as contrary-to-fact in a rhetorical question or as a true anterior pluperfect, but as Kü points out (591-92), the pf. of √sva(ñ)j is presential, so the pluperfect is simply a past tense. The form is anomalous in several respects. First, it has a retroflexed initial, despite following -a-, but this is easily accounted for: the verb is always accompanied by the preverb pári, and the retroflexion has simply been carried over into this environment. (This is the only place where the verbal form doesn’t immediately follow the preverb.) The root is also otherwise middle in inflection: pres. pári ṣvajate (5x, beside 1x act. pariṣvájat VI.60.10, q.v.), pf. pári ṣasvaje (4x). But our plupf. is active; it also has apparent thematic inflection (expect *áṣasvak). These two morphological features are highly reminiscent of the aduhat-type actives built to old t-less middle presents of the type duhé, with expected t-less imperfect *aduha, remarked with the act. -t ending - so brilliantly analyzed by Wackernagel long ago. It seems that the pf. ending of ṣasvaje was analyzed as (if) a primary ending, with a corresponding secondary -a, which then required remarking.

parṇā́has a double reading: in the frame ‘leaves’ (of the rescuing tree in ab), in the simile ‘feathers’, as Ge (n. 7c) points out.

The mṛgá- seems to be specifically a wild bird, like its Avestan cognate mərəγa-.

Ge tr. śrómatāya kám as “(euch) zum Ruhme”; that is, the Aśvins will accrue fame from their rescue of Bhujyu. This is certainly possible, and the stem śrómatadoes mean ‘fame’ once elsewhere (cf. VIII.66.9), though it usually means, by my interpr., ‘attentive hearing’ (VI.19.10, VII.24.5). Here also I take it to mean ‘hearing’: ‘for hearing’, that is, for the story to be heard. WG tr. “zur Gehorsamkeit” and in the n. specify that it is Bhujyu who should be obedient. Since as far as I now Bhujyu hadn’t been disobedient, and certainly not to the Aśvins, I don’t understand the interpr., esp. as śrómata- doesn’t elsewhere mean ‘obedience’.
