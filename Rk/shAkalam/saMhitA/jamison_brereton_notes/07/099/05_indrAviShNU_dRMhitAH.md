Both Śambara and Varcin are Indra’s targets elsewhere, with no involvement of Viṣṇu. They are conjoined objects (varcínaṃ śambaraṃ ca) of Indra’s smiting (áhan) in VI.47.21. 129 There is numerical play between the two hemistichs: in c the numbers are raised both by a digit (9 à 10) and by a factor of 10 (9 [/10] à 100; 90 [/100] à 1000). The connection is emphasized by the parallel structure of the numerical expression: b: #náva X navatíṃ ca / c: #śatám X sahásraṃ ca. Varcin is credited elsewhere with the same number of forces: II.14.6, IV.30.15.

I do not know why the verb is in the present in the second hemistich (hatháḥ) but aorist in the first (śnathiṣṭam). In the passages containing the other three occurrences of Varcin (II.14.6, IV.30.15, VI.47.21) the verbs are all preterital.
