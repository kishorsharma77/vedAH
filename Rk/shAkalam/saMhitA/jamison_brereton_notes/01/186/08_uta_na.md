I take -senā- here and in 9d as ‘weapon’, not ‘army’ (contra the standard interp.), because I think ‘weapon’ works better in 9d with the simile in 9c. However, ‘army’ (that is, warrior band vel sim.) is certainly not excluded.

Given the sequence vṛddhásenāḥ … pṛ́ṣadaśvāso ‘vánayo ná ráthāḥ, opening with two bahuvrīhis, the last term avánayo ná ráthāḥ looks very like a decomposed bahuvrīhi *aváni-ratha- ‘having chariots (like) streams’. Curiously, though Re is usually quick to suggest such an interpr., he does not mention such a possibility in his notes.
