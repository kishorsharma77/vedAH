This verse then showcases a different kind of immobility for Indra: ánapacyuta- ‘unbudgeable’; Indra here is not held, as it were, against his will, as perhaps in 7b, but because of his immense power he cannot be moved by lesser powers. Since in the immediately preceding verse (7c) the hope was to cause him to stir (√cyu [cyāvayasi]), it is striking that here it is asserted that he cannot be made to √cyu. (The relationship between these two forms should probably have been signaled in the Engl: perhaps “you rouse ... unrousable.”) On the cmpd avāryá-kratu- ‘possessing unobstructable resolve’, see comm. ad IX.98.12.
