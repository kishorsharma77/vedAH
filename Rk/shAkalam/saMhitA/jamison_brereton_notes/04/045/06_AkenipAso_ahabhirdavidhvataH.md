ākenipā́saḥ: see Old, EWA s.v. āké.

Very unusually, pāda b is a verbatim repetition of 2d. Except in refrains, repeated pādas are almost never found in the same hymn. In this particular case the repeated pādas are symmetrical, that is, found in vss. equidistant from the center, but there are no other signs of omphalos structure in this hymn, save for the faint ringcomposition between vss. 1 and 7 (see below). Since horses and chariots are the referents in 2d, I supply horses as the subject here. That the sun then hitches up his horses in c may support this.

Although the intens. dávidhu- (also dódhu-) generally takes an object, it is often an internal one (that is, a body part of the subj., e.g., lips, horns), and in this passage I think it is simply intransitive (though Schaeffer, Intens. 138, supplies lips).

Ge (/WG) supply ‘darkness’ as obj. on the basis of IV.13.4 dávidhvataḥ … támaḥ, but if, as seems likely, horses are the subject, I have trouble envisioning them shaking anything with their hooves.
