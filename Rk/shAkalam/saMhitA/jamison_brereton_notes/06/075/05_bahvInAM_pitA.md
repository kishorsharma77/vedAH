The expression bahúr asya putráḥ in the singular is somewhat surprising next to the fem. pl. bahvīnā́m, but Re’s suggestion that it is a “bahuvrīhi défait” can be adopted, whatever we may think the grammatical process is. I have adopted Griffith’s “with many a son” (both RV and VS tr.; see also Maurer), which is surprisingly apt. As is generally recognized, the masc. and fem. referents are both arrows: in addition to the standard fem. íṣu-, forming part of the ‘quiver’ cmpd itself (iṣudhí- in c), there are masc. ‘arrow’ words, incl. bāṇá-, found in vs. 17 below, and śalyá-.

Another onomatopoetic word: ciścā́, which is a hapax (though cf. ciściṣākāram, with √kṛ as here, not attested till the sūtras; see Hoffmann Aufs. 39). Since it expresses the sound of the quiver, “clatter” (pub. tr.), “rattle” (Doniger, Maurer), “clang and clash” (Griffith, RV and VS) all seem within reasonable range; Keith’s “whiz” much less so. Again the sound may in fact just be “chishcha.”
