This vs. is syntactically dependent on 28, with the acc. purūtámam picking up tvā in 28a.

The cognate expression vā́jebhir vājayatā́m “competing for the prize with their prizes” is a bit puzzling. I interpr. it as being a slight play on words, with the instr. vā́jebhiḥ referring to the singers’ songs, expressing the means by which they compete, while the prizes they compete for are material goods and fame. This interpr. is somewhat supported by the next vs., where we hope that our praise-song is the most successful one.
