Though Gr identifies rathī́ḥ here as a nom. plural, thus a devī-type form beside the correct vṛkī-type rathi yàḥ found elsewhere, there is no reason not to take it as the nom. singular it appears to be, since number agreement in similes is not so strictly carried through in RV as in Classical poetics. So also AiG III.179 (though taking it as nom. sg. used as nom. pl.).

The image itself is somewhat striking: the songs mounting Indra as their chariot. Indra is usually the active charioteer figure.
