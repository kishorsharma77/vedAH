It is not entirely clear what to supply as the referent for the rel. in c; Re ‘les succès,” Ge the vā̋jān from 4b. Pāda c closely resembles IX.63.11 yó dūṇā́śo vanuṣyatā́“which is difficult to attain by one who craves it,” with instr. vanuṣyatā́ matching our vanúṣā and a different lexicalization of the ‘difficult to obtain’ (duṣ- √naś/sah) compd. The referent in that passage is rayí- ‘wealth’, and note also the cmpd brhád ̥ -rayi- (only 1x) and the regular use of bṛhánt- as a modifier of rayí- (e.g., nearby IX.97.21). I therefore supply a pl. form of rayí-, though Ge’s vā́jawould also work.
