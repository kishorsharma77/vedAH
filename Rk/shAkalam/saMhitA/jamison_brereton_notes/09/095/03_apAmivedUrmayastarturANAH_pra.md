Pada b prá manīṣā́īrate sómam ácha “The inspired thoughts press forward to Soma” is the intrans. equivalent of 2b íyarti vā́cam “He [=Soma] directs his speech,” with act. transitive redupl. pres. íyarti corresponding to its weak form, medial intrans. ī́rte. This connection is obscured by the Engl. tr.

The deployment of ca, first conjoining two preverbs enfolding their joint verb (c … úpa ca yánti sáṃ ca), and then in the next pāda conjoining a new preverb, but with a different verb (d ā́ca viśanti), is a striking effect. The contrastive preverbs in c of course account for the accent on the main-cl. verb yánti.
