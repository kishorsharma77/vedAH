The simile in b, svàrmīḷhe ná “as if at (a contest) with the sun as its prize,” provides a transition from the sun-winning myth of Indra and Kutsa, which occupied the previous few vss., and this more general final section of the hymn.

The desires (kā́māḥ) that are the grammatical subject of this vs. -- namely our desires for Indra’s largesse -- take part in actions that might appear to be more appropriate to other subjects. On the one hand, they “take pleasure in the pressing” (sávane cakānā́ḥ); we would rather expect the god Indra to do so. On the other, they “perform ritual labor with hymns” (śaśamānā́sa ukthaíḥ), a priestly activity. The desires thus mediate between the two poles of ritual participation.

Pace Oldenberg, ókaḥ in d is most likely not an acc. goal to be construed with agman in a (though this might be a possible secondary reading), but a nominative -- on the basis of a web of formulaic associations with raṇvá- ‘delightful’. Cf. I.66.3 óko ná raṇváḥ “(Agni) delightful like a home”; also I.69.4-5 raṇvó duroṇé “a joy in the house,” X.64.11 [=I.144.7] raṇváḥ … iva kṣáyaḥ “delightful … like a dwelling,” X.33.6 kṣétraṃ ná raṇvám “delightful like a dwelling place.” The problem in our passage is that raṇvā́(the only possible underlying form given its sandhi context) cannot technically modify neut. ókaḥ, despite the formulaics just discussed. The solution, as Ge saw (n. 15d), is that nom. sg. fem. raṇvā́also participates in the second simile in this pāda, sudṛ́ṣīva puṣṭíḥ “like prosperity beautiful to see” -- with which raṇvá- also has formulaic associations. Cf. I.65.5 puṣṭír ná raṇvā́“like thriving that brings delight” (immediately followed by kṣitíḥ ‘dwelling place’) and II.4.4 raṇvā́… iva puṣṭíḥ ‘id.’. Of course, both similes provide comparisons to the desires that are the ultimate subject, with raṇvā́as the pivotal tert. comp. in both -- though it does not match kā́māḥ in gender or number.
