The little nominal clause aghā́aryó árātayaḥ with its unremarkable sentiment (“evil are the hostilities of the stranger”) may have been a popular saying, as it’s found in the same form nearby in VI.59.8, an Indra-Agni hymn. It is not clear to me why Pūṣan would care or why the speaker seems to impart it as a secret.
