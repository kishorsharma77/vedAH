What is the “armor” (várma) that soma “plunges through” (ví gāhate)? Ge (n.

14ab) suggests that the image is of a warrior clothing himself in armor, that is, the wooden cup, but he doesn’t construe várma with the verb, but takes it as loosely descriptive with a verb used absolutely (“er taucht in seinen Panzer unter”). Re also thinks the várma refers to the cup (“la paroi [wall] de la cuve” acdg. to his n.), but has the courage to construe it with the verb: “il plonge dans (le récipient, sa) cuirasse.” But ví is not “dans.” I think it refers instead to the filter, whose fleece both represents his armor and a substance that soma must get through, hence the slightly off-balance image. Note first of all that the same verb, though with different preverb, is used precisely with the filter a few vss. later in this hymn:
