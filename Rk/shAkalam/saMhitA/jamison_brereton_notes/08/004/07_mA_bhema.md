The logical connection between pādas c and d can be variously interpreted (see Ge n.). In my view pāda c expresses the desire that Indra should in short order perform a great deed that we can witness, rather than the usual bland notion that we wish to celebrate his previous great deeds. Since Indra regularly aids Turvaśa and Yadu (e.g., I.54.6), we may desire to see them (pāda d) because under those circumstances we are likely to encounter Indra doing such deeds.
