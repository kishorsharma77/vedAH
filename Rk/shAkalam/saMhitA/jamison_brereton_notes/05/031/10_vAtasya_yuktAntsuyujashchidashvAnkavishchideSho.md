The devī́svádhitiḥ in pāda a is much disputed, and for good reason. The stem svádhiti- means ‘axe, hatchet’, but the presence of such an implement here is puzzling. Ge, flg. Sāy., wants to take this instance of the stem as independent and equivalent to svadhā́- ‘autonomous power’. Given the occurrence of svadhā́- in 4a and the derived possessive adj. svadhā́van- in pāda d of this same vs., it is hard not to suspect some connection. On the other hand, svádhiti- ‘axe’ is too well established for that sense not to be the first reading, or at least to intrude, and, furthermore, pāda a is twinned with b, which also contains a thing not a quality (and is also a pun).

I therefore think we are dealing with a pun. On the one hand, even the “heavenly hatchet,” which sounds like a formidable weapon, bows to powerful Indra.

The hatchet’s submission to Indra is a measure of his might and may also put this weapon into his hands. There may even be another intertextual reference to I.32, as Teigo Onishi suggested to me. In I.32.5c Vṛtra lies “like branches hewn apart by an axe” (skándhāṃsīva kúliśenā vívṛkṇā). Though this is a simile, not a direct reference to the narrative, and though a different word for axe, kúliśa-, is used, this imagery may be a common trope in the Vṛtra story. As for the reading “the goddess Autonomous Power,” the phonological similarity and possible identical formation of svádhiti and svadhā́- (with sva- looking like a first cmpd member in both, and -dhiresembling -dhā́-, with connection to √dhā at least possible [the etymology of svádhiti- is “nicht klar” acdg. to EWA s.v.]) make such a reading very easy in this context.

As just noted, pāda b also seems to contain a pun. The way (gātú-) yields to Indra, but, acdg. to the Anukramaṇī, Gātu Ātreya is also the poet of this hymn -- though since only this one hymn in the RV is attributed to him, the name may have been plucked from this context.

This vs. contains another example of the transfer of vocabulary from Vṛtra to Indra. As we saw, in 4a Vṛtra was intoxicated by (his false assumption about) his autonomous power (svadháyā mádantam), but here it is Indra who possesses autonomous power (svadhā́van-) for real. With svádhiti in pāda a also (partly) expressing Indra’s acquisition of this power, his triumph is complete. This sets the stage for the transition to the last two verses, where the poet announces his own contact with Indra’s fame and what that will mean for his own good fortune.
