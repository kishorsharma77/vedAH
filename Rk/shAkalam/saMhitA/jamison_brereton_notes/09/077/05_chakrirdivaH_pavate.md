Soma is notably identified with Varuṇa and Mitra in this vs. - the former because he cannot be deceived by the crooked (hurúg yaté), the latter because (implicitly) he mediates between the ritual communities (vṛjána-).

With Mayr. (EWA s.v. híruk), I take hurúk to √hvar ‘go crookedly’ (also in a moral sense). The expression hurúg yaté contrasts with ṛtáṃ yaté “going to truth” in the same metrical position in nearby IX.69.3, 74.3 and four other times.
