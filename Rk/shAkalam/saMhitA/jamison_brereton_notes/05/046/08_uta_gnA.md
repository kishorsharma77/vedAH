This last vs. is in a diff. meter and also shows some metrical irregularities (see HvN notes). It seems tacked on, to allow an enumeration of the gods’ wives in question, most of whom (save for Indrāṇī) have a very shadowy existence. It is also not clear whether aśvínī and rā́ṭ refer to a single individual or two.

The last phrase, yá ṛtúr jánīnām “which is the regular season for women,” is somewhat puzzling, made more so by the fact that there is no overt referent in the main clause for the yáḥ, since the verb vyántu lacks an object (also in pāda a). I follow Ge (flg. Sāy.) in taking this as a reference to the patnīsaṃyāja offering (or its forerunner), and I therefore supply ‘offering’ as obj. for vyántu (havís-, etc., is a common, though not invariable, obj. to this root). The rel. cl. is then also a pun: it refers not only to this offering, which is the ritual “time/season” allotted to women, but probably also to their menstrual periods, since ṛtú- is regularly so used later. For a similar pun, using the adj. ṛtvíyāvatī-, see VIII.12.10, 80.7.
