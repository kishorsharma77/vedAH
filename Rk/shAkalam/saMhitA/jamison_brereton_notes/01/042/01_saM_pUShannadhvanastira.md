Note the regularly contrasting preverbs sám and ví opening the first two pādas.

Though Re and, judging from his tr., Ge take sákṣvā to √sac ‘accompany’, following Gr., according to Narten (265 and n. 834, and already so in BR, Whitney’s Roots, etc.) it belongs with √sah ‘conquer’. That prá √sah is fairly common in the RV (including nominal compounds) while prá √sac occurs only once (X.27.19) may support this root assignment. I am, however, disturbed by the position of the preverb and its accompanying enclitic pronoun naḥ: the collocation looks like the start of a new clause. I wonder if we don’t in fact have two imperative clauses here, the second with a gapped ihi. Cf. VIII.17.9 índra préhi purás tvám. My translation “go forth … to victory” reflects this possible interpretation.
