Indra  
Krṣ̥ na Āṅgirasa  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
The usual mutually beneficial relationship between Indra, giver of bounties and  aid in battle, and the singer/sacrificer offering poems and oblations in exchange is  the theme of this hymn. However, the hymn is scarcely run-of-the-mill, for the poet  has captured the relationship in a series of deftly fashioned images, and the balance  between giving god and offering mortals is maintained throughout.
