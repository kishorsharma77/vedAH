This next vs. indicates that the reminder had its effect. The grammatical identity of ā́dade is ambiguous: it could be pres. indic. or pf. indic. In fact in my interpr. of this two-verse sequence 7-8 it doesn’t really matter: 8c could be tr. “I take as soon as they are offered” without disturbing the rhetorical sequence. However, I follow most (incl. Kü, 241) in taking it as a preterital pf. rather than as a pres. with Hoffmann (Injunk, 232; so also WG).
