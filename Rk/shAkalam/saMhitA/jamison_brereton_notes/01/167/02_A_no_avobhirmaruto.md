However, the juxtaposition of the first two words in III.26.4 śubhé sámmiślāḥ pṛ́ṣatīr ayukṣata is suggestive of a connection here between śubhé and nímiślām (though in the publ. tr. of III.26.4 śubhé is not construed with sámmiślāḥ but with ayukṣata). Still I remain inclined towards my “mount for beauty,” because I think nímiślām refers to Rodasī’s intimate connection with the Maruts, which was emphasized at the very beginning of the mythological section, 3a mimyákṣa yéṣu …, hence my “commingling (with them).” As was just noted, I take 6ab as the end of the little Rodasī myth and 6cd as the beginning of the section treating the current ritual. I therefore (contra the standard tr.) take cd as dependent on 7, not on 6ab.
