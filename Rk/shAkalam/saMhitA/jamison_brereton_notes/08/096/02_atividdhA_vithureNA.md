Ge tr. ávyayam as ‘ohne Einbusse’ (loss), rather than ‘ovine, belonging to sheep’ (contra Gr, etc.), presumably because of its initial accent (against the normal accent in avyáya- ‘ovine’). This seems unnecessary. The other occurrence of ávyaya- (IX.86.34) modifies the soma filter and Ge renders it “aus Schafwolle” without comment. In our passage he is following Sāy’s vyayarahitam, but vyaya- ‘disappearance, loss, outlay’ is not attested until the epic/Classical language, as far as I know. Furthermore, sheep fit nicely into this equine and bovine context, with the three terms áśvaṃ gā́m bhāgáṃ ávyayam displaying a classic Behagel’s Law configuration. As for the aberrant accent, Debrunner (AiG II.2.213) attributes it to the influence of semantically identical ávya-.

Ge takes the locative phrase in c with ab, “Welches Ross und Rind du … als Anteil … bestimmt hat für den Opfernden …” Again this seems odd and unnecessary.

The locatives of c are summarized by tásmin in d, and contrast with paṇaú at the end of that pāda. Moreover the middle voice of dadhiṣé in the relative clause contrasts functionally with the act. imperative dhehi in the main clause. First Indra acquires goods for himself, then confers them on others. By placing the recipient in the rel.

clause with the middle verb, Ge erases this neat voice contrast. Pāda c then seems to represent a heavy preposed NP picked up by initial tásmin in d.
