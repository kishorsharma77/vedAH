As disc. in the publ. intro., this vs. metaphorically expresses the complex interaction between poetry, the thoughts (dhī́- 2c, dhītí- 4a, both fem.) recited at the Soma pressing, and the Soma/soma him-/itself. The (female) thoughts “yearn for the/a bull” (vṛṣaṇyá-) to swell (√pi 2c) and impregnate (gárbhaṃ √dhā 5b) them with his semen/juice, while at the same time they are Soma’s mothers (4c) and themselves “give the gleaming milk” (śukráṃ duhaté páyaḥ 5c) -- śukrám páyaḥ being often a kenning for both soma juice and semen (see Gr, nos. 3 and 7 s.v. śukrá). So they both produce the soma/semen and become pregnant by it.
