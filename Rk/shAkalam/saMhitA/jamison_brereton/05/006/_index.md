Agni
Vasuśruta Ātreya
10 verses: paṅkti
The hymn is dominated by references to prizewinning horses. In verse 3 Agni gives  the prizewinner, which may be Agni himself. In pāda d of the verse, therefore, the  one who “journeys to what is valued” is Agni both as a god retrieving the reward  for the sacrificers and as a metaphoric horse racing to the prize. Again in verse 7  Agni’s flames are horses and the prize toward which they strive is cattle, first men
tioned in verse 1, along with horses. Allusion to horses is indirect in verse 10, but in  10ab the priests “guide” Agni—assuming with Geldner and Renou that ajuryamur is haplology for ajuryáṃ yamur—as they might guide a horse. Then in d they hope  for an “abundance of heroes and this abundance of swift horses.” There are various  possible explanations for why the poet speaks of tyád “this” abundance. One is that  there is a comparison between the horses they hope to gain and Agni’s flames imag ined as horses. If so, then “this abundance” would mean an abundance of horses  equivalent to the present abundance of flames.
