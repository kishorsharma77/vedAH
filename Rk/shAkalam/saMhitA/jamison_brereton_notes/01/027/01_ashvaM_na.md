vandádhyai is a predicated infinitive, serving as the main verb.

Pāda a contains a likely et, the possessive -vant-stem adj. vā́ravantam modifying Agni. In the first instance it means ‘having (that is, providing) choice things’ (vā́ra-, to √vṛ ‘choose’), but the homonym vā́ra- means ‘hair, tail-hair’ (cf., e.g., nearby I.32.12) and so the -vant-stem can mean ‘possessing (long) tail-hair’.

Either of these meanings is applicable to the horse of the simile, which has tail-hair by nature and brings choice things by winning races and contests. ‘Bringing choice things’ is more applicable to Agni than ‘having hair’, but his flames could be so conceived. Note that Agni is characterized as “ghee-haired” (ghṛtá-keśa-) in VIII.60.2.
