I am disturbed by the sequence of tense -- or lack of it: the augmented aor.

amatsata in the main, ā́d, clause does not fit well with the pres. pariṣkṛṇvánti in the preceding yád clause (vs. 2) or the pres. vasāyáte in the following (3c). I am tempted to make the ā́d clause the follow-up to vs. 1: “the poet flowed around and forth …; after that the gods found exhilaration.” In that case, 3ab would interrupt the sequence of the subordinated present clauses in vs. 2, 3c, but I don’t know of other examples of this kind of alternating structure. Perhaps vss. 2 and 3 should be reversed: the ā́d clause of 3ab would then follow directly after vs. 1, and the parallel subordinate clauses in 3c and vs. 2 would be picked up by the main clause of 4ab, which also has a pres. tense verb.
