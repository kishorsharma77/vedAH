Again, I do not understand the mythology here. It is worth noting, though, that in vs. 2 the various divinities acted on the horse (or such is the likely object, though unexpressed), whereas here the horse (addressed in the voc.) is identified with the (same) divinities. He is here identified with Yama (a) and Trita (b), while in 2a he was given by Yama and yoked by Trita. The third identification is with Āditya (3a), most likely the sun. Of the three remaining characters in vs. 2 (Indra, Gandharva, and the sun), the last is the most likely, and of course Āditya is a later name for the sun.

On the meaning of samáyā see comm. ad I.113.10. The abrupt separation from Soma is another puzzling feature, but I suggest that we have here the generally later identification of Soma with the Moon, found already in the wedding hymn already cited (X.85.1-5), which would make sense (well, some sense) if the horse is being identified with the Sun. Krick (308 and n. 797) very different: “Du bist mit Soma zur Hälfte durchgemischt,” which depends on her view concerning the relationship between soma and the horse. But, inter alia, her tr. depends on what I consider a wrong interpr. of samáyā.

From context alone the “three (kinship) bonds in heaven” could be identified with the trio in ab: Yama, Āditya, and Trita. The Sun of course is associated with heaven, and Yama’s realm of the dead is also placed in heaven (see the funeral hymn X.14.8). What Trita’s connection with heaven might be I don’t know: Trita is a shadowy figure in the RV.
