Ge takes nṛ́bhiḥ as the agent with the part. dī́dyānaḥ (“von den Männern entflammt (?)”), but this participle never elsewhere takes an agent. Better an instr. of accompaniment, with most other tr. That Indra is described as shining may be connected to the fact that three of the four things he generates shine too: the sun, the dawn, and fire. There is some disagreement about who the men are: the Aṅgirases or the Maruts. Given the general prominence of the Vala myth earlier in the hymn, but the more recent concentration on the Vṛtra myth, I imagine the ambiguity is intentional and both sets of Indra’s helpers are to be thought of.
