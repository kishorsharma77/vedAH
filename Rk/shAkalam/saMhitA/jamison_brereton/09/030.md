Soma Pavamāna
Bindu Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
The first verse of this hymn is very like the opening verse of IX.29, and it is con structed of the usual building blocks of soma hymns, particularly those in gāyatrī meter. It clusters especially closely with the three hymns that precede it: these four  hymns (IX.27–30) are all attributed to poets with the patronymic Āṅgirasa, and all  four contain at least one form of śúṣma “tempestuous force” or śuṣmín “tempestu ous” (IX.27.6; 28.6; 29.6; 30.1, 3), mostly in the final verse. This word thus seems  to be the signature of this little group of poets. (The word does not pattern closely  with other Āṅgirasa poets, even in the IXth Maṇḍala.)
## 1
His streams have flowed forth, those of the tempestuous one, into the  filter at will.
While becoming purified, he sends out his speech.
## 2
The drop, being impelled by the pressers, being groomed, ever roaring, raises a call appropriate to Indra.
## 3
Attract for us tempestuous force that can overcome men, much-craved  force consisting of heroes,
when you purify yourself in a stream, o Soma.
## 4
Soma, purifying himself in a stream, has flowed forth, beyond (the filter), to the wooden cups to take his seat.
## 5
They impel you, the most honeyed tawny one, in the waters with their  stones,
for Indra to drink, o drop.
## 6
Press the most honeyed soma for Indra who bears the mace,
the dear, exhilarating one for his warrior band.
