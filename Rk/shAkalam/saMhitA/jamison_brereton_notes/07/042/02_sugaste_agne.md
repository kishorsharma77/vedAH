The ‘road’ of Agni, ádhvan-, in pāda a picks up its etymological relative adhvará- ‘ceremony, lit. ritual cursus’ in 1d, a relationship unfortunately difficult to convey without awkwardness in tr. 69 Sāy. reads *sú te for suté, and Old favors this reading on the grounds that suté is rare in Agni context. But since the last hemistich of the preceding vs. (and possibly pāda b as well) concerns the soma, this does not seem a cogent enough objection to change the text. Sāy. likewise reads *jánimā níṣattaḥ rather than jánimāni sattáḥ.

This would make fine sense -- and ní √sad is a very common idiom for Agni’s seating at the ritual when acting as Hotar -- but it again requires emending a text that makes sense on its own.

As indicated in the publ. intro., the vari-colored horses in bc are Agni’s flames. The “I” of d is presumably the poet impersonating Agni as Hotar.
