Although pāda a lacks a verb, the parallel VIII.79.5 arthíno yánti céd ártham suggests a form of ‘go’.

The rest of the verse depicts sex between a married couple, a particularly important activity in maintaining earthly order and continuity. The mutual action, expressed by the middle dual tuñjā́te, probably refers to the expressing of semen, as in d, although the sexual juices of both husband and wife might be meant. In d either the husband or the wife may be the subject of duhe, depending in part on which root the gerund paridā́ya is assigned to: √dā ‘give’ (with pári ‘deliver, surrender’) or √dā ‘bind’. I favor a pun.
