      <description>[I.1 JPB]
2 Vāyu, etc. (Praügaśastra)
The recipients of the various tṛcas making up these two rather simple hymns are clearly signalled. All three verses making up the first tṛca to Vāyu (vss. 1-3) open with a voc. vāyo; the second tṛca (to Indra and Vāyu, vss. 4-6) opens with the voc. índravāyū, while the next two begin with the famous “Vāyav Indraś ca” construction (on which see Jamison 1988). The pattern is varied in the Mitra and Varuṇa tṛca (7- 9), with the conjoined accusatives mitrám and váruṇaṃ ca opening the first and second pādas of vs.</description>

      <description>Maṇḍala II
1 Agni For the rhetorical structure of the hymn, see the publ. intro.
1.1 The only attestation of the desiderative of √śuc is this hapax adj. āśuśukṣáṇi- ‘eager to blaze here’.
1.2 The accent on ási in d presumably results from its contrastive function in the ca … ca construction. Curiously Old does not comment. Note the two different words for house in gṛhápatiḥ … dáme, with the former replacing old dáṃpati-.</description>

      <description>Commentary III [III.1-7 JPB] III.8 Sacrificial Post On the structure of this hymn, see the publ. intro.
8.1 Note the future impv. dhattāt.
8.4 Kane (HDŚ II.1.269) suggests that the image in this vs. is that of a young boy, well dressed and encircled with his sacred thread (yúvā suvā́sāḥ párivītaḥ), at his Upanayana, whom they “lead up” (ún nayanti), in an idiom close to the úpa √nī of the Upanayana.</description>

      <description>Commentary IV
1 Agni I do not understand the emphasis on Varuṇa in the early parts of the hymn (vss. 2–5; see also 18d), since the Vala myth and the unnamed Aṅgirases in the later parts of the hymn have no obvious conceptual connection with Varuṇa and the Ādityas (see also Aditi in 20a).
1.1 Hymn-introductory hí is difficult to render. It does not have its normal causal sense, though perhaps in this position hí is meant to explain why the hymn is recited following a particular ritual action.</description>

      <description>Commentary V [V.1–28 JPB]
29 Indra As noted in the publ. intro., the hymn is punctuated by expressions of somadrinking, each slightly different and generally found in the 2nd half of an even pāda: 2b &amp;hellip; papivā́ṃsaṃ sutásya 3b &amp;hellip; sómasya súṣutasya peyāḥ 3d &amp;hellip; papivā́m índro asya [rhyming with 2b] 5b &amp;hellip; somapéyam [cf. 3b] [7d sutám pibat &amp;hellip; sómam] 8b &amp;hellip; somyā́pā́ḥ 11d &amp;hellip; ápibaḥ sómam asya
29.1 I follow Brereton (Ādityas, 165–66), who in turn followed Thieme (Mitra and Aryaman, 78–77), in taking aryamā́not as nom.</description>

      <description>Commentary VI
1 Agni
1.1 As noted ad loc., the first hymn of Maṇḍala IV begins identically (IV.1.1.a): tváṃ hí agne, with the same puzzling use of ordinarily causal hí in the first pāda of a hymn. It might be possible here to tr. the first hemistich as a causal clause subordinate to cd: “Because … you became the first minder of this insightful thought and the Hotar, you made …” On the stem manótar- see comm.</description>

      <description>Commentary VII [VII.1–17 JPB] VII.18 Indra (Battle of the Ten Kings) I have little or nothing to contribute to the interpr. of this famous hymn, esp. of its historical or quasi-historical aspects. The hymn has been extensively treated by a number of scholars both fairly recently, esp. H.-P. Schmidt (Indica 17 [1980], 41– 47) and M. Witzel (in The Indo-Aryans in Ancient South Asia [1995], esp. 333-37), and in the past, and I will therefore limit my comments.</description>

      <description>1 Indra
1.1 In the publ. tr. I take ca in d as conjoining the two clauses found in c and d (so apparently also Ge and explicitly Klein, DGRV I.103, 105). However, given that the ca is somewhat wrongly positioned and that it reminds us of other ukthā́ca passages, I now consider it possible that ukthā́ca is part of a truncated conjoined NP. See disc. ad VIII.82.4.
1.2 This verse, couched in the acc.</description>

      <description>Commentary IX.1–67 Since all hymns in this maṇḍala are dedicated to Soma Pavamāna, the dedicand will not be identified for each hymn. In both the publ. tr. and in the comm., I have tried to use lower case soma for the substance and capped Soma for the god, but of course much of the point of the Soma Maṇḍala is that the two cannot be separated. So this convention is not fully workable.</description>

      <description>RV commentary: introductory remarks and abbreviations
As a companion to the Jamison-Brereton English translation of the Ṛgveda (The Rigveda: The Earliest Religious Poetry of India. An English Translation, Oxford UP, 2014), we two translators intend to provide a more detailed commentary on the translation, intended for readers with Sanskrit who are interested in how, starting from the text, we arrived at the translations we did, especially in the frequent cases in which our translations diverge from the standard ones, esp.</description>
