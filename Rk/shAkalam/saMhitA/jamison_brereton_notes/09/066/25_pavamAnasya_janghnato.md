With Ge and Re, I supply ‘darkness(es)’ (támāṃsi) as obj. of jáṅghnataḥ on the basis of 24c.

I supply ‘drops’ with candrā́ḥ on the basis of III.40.4 candrā́sa índavaḥ, though Ge’s “Güsse” and Re’s “coulées de soma” certainly fit the context, too. My “drops” is indirectly supported by the additional descriptor jīrā́ḥ ‘lively’, which is most commonly found in the cmpd. jīrá-dānu- ‘having lively drops’, with a different word for drop.

Note the play jīrā́ajirá-. The cmpd ajirá-śocis- is a bit difficult to fit into context.

The 1st member ajirá- means ‘quick, nimble, agile’, and the whole bahuvrīhi occurs once elsewhere of Agni, VIII.19.13, where I tr. “of nimble flame.” How this would apply to drops is not entirely clear; I assume it refers to the propensity of drops, esp. moving drops, to catch the light. It is also possible that ajiráśociṣaḥ is gen. sg. and modifies Soma, rather than nom. pl. modifying the drops. This would not appreciably change the image.
