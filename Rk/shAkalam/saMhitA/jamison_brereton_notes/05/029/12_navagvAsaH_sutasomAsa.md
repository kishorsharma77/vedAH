This vs. brings the third repetition of arcanti (1c, 6c [or árcan(t); see above]; cf. ā́rcan 2b).

I don’t quite understand the double cid construction in cd, where even one cid seems somewhat superfluous. Ge (/WG) take it as concessive and logically to be construed with apidhā́navantam (“the cowpen, although it had a cover” [Ge: “obwohl verschlossen,” sim. WG]). This is possible, though I don’t like the position of cid, and I would also note that #gávyaṃ cid ūrvám is also found in VII.90.4, where a concessive value is harder to wring out.
