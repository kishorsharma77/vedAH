The second pāda should read sántu bhrātrā́gne, with coalescence of the avowels. This also entails reading, out of sandhi, unaccented agne, contra Pp and HvN.

The impv. sántu is accented because it’s initial in the pāda.

The expression śivā́naḥ sakhyā́sántu ... devéṣu yuṣmé is very similar to VI.18.5 tán naḥ pratnáṃ sakhyám astu yuṣmé, which I take as existential. On the basis of that passage and of VII.22.9 (=X.23.7) asmé te santu sakhyā́śivā́ni, I think this passage should be harmonized with the others and interpreted as existential: “Let there be a propitious partnership for us among [or, with] you, the gods.” For further disc., incl. of the loc. pronoun, cf. comm. ad VI.18.5.
