payovṛ́dh- has several possible values. In addition to the ‘milk-strong’ in the publ. tr., it would also be possible to take the -vṛdh- transitively: “strengthening with their milk [=rain]” or “strengthening the milk [=rain]”; either alternative is supported by vss. 5-6.

The lexeme úd √han is quite rare and occurs with the verb stem jíghna- only here. Since the exact sense of the lexeme is not certain, it is difficult to know how to complete the simile. I have interpreted the verb to mean ‘beat up’; with regard to roads there is a nice parallel in the English idiom “pound the pavement.” I assume that ā́pathi- refers to walkers on a path and supply ‘road’ as the object parallel to the mountains and their feet as the instrument of pounding that is parallel to the wheelrims. ET compares the French idiom ‘frayer le chemin’, used of blazing a trail, which may well be the sense meant here. Ge takes the verb as ‘aufreissen’ (tear open/up) and supplies ‘stones’ as the object (sim. WG). I am a little puzzled as to why his Strassenfahrer would be tearing up stones, but I suppose it might be to clear a rugged path. Re: “… arrachent les montagnes, tels des frayeurs-de-voie.” I do not know what he means by this.
