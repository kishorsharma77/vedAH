The metrical decay noted for 8cd continues here. Although the first half of the vs. has the expected 10 syllables with a word boundary after 5 -- thus allowing a division into two DV pādas -- the opening of b is huve, an unaccented verb. In the immediately preceding vs. pāda b opens with accented yuyóta, which must owe its accent to its pāda-initial position, as there are no syntactic features favoring it. The DV here is far less sensitive to the pāda boundary. Even more clearly, the second half of the vs. is an undoubted Triṣṭubh, since it has 11 syllables and a caesura after the first 4, with the unaccented voc. maruto spanning syllables 5-7.

Both Ge and Re (also Lub) take vāvaśānā́ḥ to √vaś ‘want, desire’ with the supposed object being soma, but I think it makes more sense, and requires less machinery, to assign it to √vāś ‘bellow’. Otherwise too much has been gapped and needs to be supplied; cf. Re’s expansive parenthesis: “… pour qu’à satiété … (vous vous gorgiez de soma, le) désirant-avec-force.” See the same disagreement about the affiliation of the same participle in VII.36.6, with comm. ad loc.
