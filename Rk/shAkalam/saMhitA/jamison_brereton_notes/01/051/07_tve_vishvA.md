The phrasing of pāda b is conceptually backwards, strikingly so. Ordinarily Indra drinks the soma and is moved to be generous, whereas here his (latent) generosity rouses itself in anticipation of the soma.

víśvāni carelessly omitted in publ. tr.: “all the bullish strengths.” More alliteration: vṛścā́śátror áva víśvāni vṛ́ṣnyā, with sequences of v with either i or ṛ, followed by ś or ṣ (with a few more v’s and a ś thrown in).
