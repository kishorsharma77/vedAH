I take dhāti as a root aor. subjunctive (as apparently also Kü, judging from his tr. “… soll … führen …,” p. 186); unfortunately it does not have a distracted root vowel.

Note the extreme alliteration of b: … devī́dhiṣáṇā dhāti devám, with mirrorimage plain and aspirated voiced stops, as well as the etym. figure devī́… deváṃ enclosing the whole.

The niyút- in this vs. are explicitly identified as Vāyu’s ‘own’ (svā́ḥ), which supports the view that the niyút- in 1c are not Vāyu’s but ours.

The question in d is the referent of vásudhiti- ‘treasure-chamber’. Both Gr and Ge identify it as Vāyu himself, though this seems pretty much excluded by the fact that acc. vásudhitim is conjoined with the other acc. vāyúm (c) by utá (see Klein DGRV I.323-24, though he also suggests Vāyu could be the referent). Old suggests Indra (flg. Pischel), and Re so renders it in tr. To me Agni seems more likely than either Indra or Vāyu, since Agni is actually called a vásudhiti- in I.128.8, and śvetá- 111 ‘gleaming’ is more appropriate to Agni than to either of those gods. (For Agni as śvetá- see, e.g., V.1.4.) However, to my mind the most likely referent is Dawn, a possibility also floated by Re. Dual vásudhiti- occurs twice (III.31.17, IV.48.3), both times of Night and Dawn. In both cases the noun is modified by dual kṛṣṇé ‘black’, which of course characterizes only one of the pair and evokes the opposite, suppressed quality, ‘bright’ (see comm. ad IV.48.3). In IV.48.3 the two treasurechambers are intimately associated with Vāyu and his journey to the sacrifice. Note also that the dawns show up in the very next pāda in our hymn (4a). The one obstacle to identifying vásudhitim here as Dawn is that the accompanying adj. śvetám is masc., but this would be problematic in any case, if it modifies vásudhiti-, because the noun itself is fem. (see du. fem. kṛṣṇé just cited)—though it can have a masc. referent (e.g., I.128.8 agním hótāram īḷate vásudhitim “They invoke Agni, the Hotar, [as] treasurechamber]”). I assume that *śvetām has been redactionally shortened (without metrical consequences, since it precedes a consonant-initial word) on the basis of such equational passages, or perhaps on the basis of such passages vásudhiti- was simply interpr. as masc. here.
