The referent of the 2nd ps. du. encl. vām is clearly the World-halves in the repeated fem. voc. phrase mānavī …rodasī / … devī. The vocc. are somewhat contradictory, identifying the World-halves as both goddesses and as related to mankind (or Manu). Ge (n. 9ab) ingeniously and persuasively suggests that the dual referent is the soma-press with its two jaws. In IX.75.4 the World-halves are called the mothers of Soma, and our passage depicts his birth as related to them. Ge supplies “son” for vām to depend on; Re seems to take vām as a dative (or datival gen.): “… est né … pour vous deux,” which loses the maternal relationship. I take the vām as indicating the oblique source with pass. janiṣṭa “was born of,” which avoids Ge’s need to supply a head noun. However, there is no serious semantic distinction between my interpr. and Ge’s.

The final pāda lacks a verb, but contains an apparent obj. tám most likely referring to Soma. The negated nom. part. ásredhan demands a masc. sg. subj.; the adverbial neut.acc. sg. or loc. sg. tuviṣváni ‘very noisily / in/at the very noisy one’ (?) suggests a verb of sound or speech: “I praise’ (Ge) / ‘he [priest] praises” (Re) would fit these conditions fine without imposing itself.
