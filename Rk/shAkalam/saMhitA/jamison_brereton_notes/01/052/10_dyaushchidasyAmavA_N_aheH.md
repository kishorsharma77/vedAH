I agree with Ge (against Pp, Gr, Old, Re, WG) that loc. vájre should be read for Pp. nom. vájraḥ and that this locative is functionally, but not grammatically, parallel with áheḥ svanā́t “from the sound of the serpent.” With Ge and Old (and back at least to Ludwig), I see no choice but to accent the apparent voc. rodasī as ródasī. In the publ. tr. it should therefore be marked with an asterisk.
