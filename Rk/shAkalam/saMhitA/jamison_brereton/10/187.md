Agni
Vatsa Āgneya
5 verses: gāyatrī
Found in AVŚ VI.34, this unremarkable hymn contains a refrain that suggests the  militant Agni, but only verse 3 develops this theme.
## 1
Rouse forth speech for Agni, for the bull of the settlements.
He will carry us across hatreds.
## 2
Who from the distant distance shines across the wastelands,
he will carry us across hatreds.
## 3
Who grinds down the demonic forces, the bull with flaming flame, he will carry us across hatreds.
## 4
Who looks at all creatures separately and sees them whole,
he will carry us across hatreds.
## 5
Who on the far shore of this airy realm was born as flaming Agni, he will carry us across hatreds.
