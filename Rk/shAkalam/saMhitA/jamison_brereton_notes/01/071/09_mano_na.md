As mentioned in the publ. intro., the reason for including this verse, containing the Sun and Mitra and Varuṇa but no mention of Agni, isn’t clear.

However, it may be that Mitra and Varuṇa, the guardians of the moral and ethical order, and their all-seeing eye, the Sun, who observes all behavior, are brought in as witnesses of the shocking incest of the last verse and the appropriate punishment inflicted by Agni.
