There is no overt interrogative marker in b, but the kuvíd of c may suggest a similar question in b.

The transitive thematic subjunctive vāvṛdhāti is assigned to the “Aorist des Caus.” by Gr, but the properly formed redupl. caus. aorist ávīvṛdha- occupies that slot. Other than our form, all forms belonging to the vāvṛdha- stem are medial, and it seems best to follow Kü (471) in seeing this thematic stem as built to the perfect in order to allow the root-final consonant to be maintained in forms like 2nd sg. impv.

vāvṛdhásva (since athem. *vāvṛtsvá could be taken to the root √vṛt ‘turn’); see now further my 2017 art. on perf. impv (García Ramón Fs.). These medial intrans./reflex.

forms in turn generated the oppositional trans. act. vāvṛdhāti.

I take kétam páram in d as referring to Indra’s “distant intention” (which we hope to move closer to us; see úpa in 1a, 2a), rather than our “highest wish,” as is standard. The middle voice of āvárjate may support this. However the other interpretation is certainly possible.
