As noted in the publ. intro., the sense of these enigmatic paradoxes is not clear, as so often when family relationships and implied incest are in question. The females who “strengthen his great masculine nature” are left unidentified, but in some sense this scarcely matters: the point is that feminine beings strengthen his masculine nature and shortly thereafter there’s semen in play. The dual mātárā can (and probably does) stand for the two parents and is so tr. by all; however, it is more piquant for the two mothers to enjoy the semen presumably of their son, and the mother word contrasts with the father in c. For other contextually appropriate use of the dual parental designations, see Dīrghatamas’s I.159.2-3.

In c it might be better if “names” were in parentheses: although nā́ma in d can be either sg. or pl. (and is the former in conjunction with flg. tṛtī́yam), it can’t be dual, as the pair of adj. ávaram páram “lower and higher” might require.
