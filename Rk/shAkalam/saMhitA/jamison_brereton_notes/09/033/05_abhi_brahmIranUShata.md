Fem. bráhmī- is found only here (fortunately!). It is generally taken as a word play based on yahvī́ḥ in the next pāda (see Old with lit.; AiG II.2.412), which is surely correct.

But it seems further assumed that it is derived from the adj. brahmán- and is adjectival (AiG II.2.421; cf. Gr ‘heilig, andächtig’, Re ‘vouées à la Formule’; Ge’s ‘Beterstimmen’ is less clear). Given its accent I think it’s more likely a nonce fem. form of the noun bráhman- ‘formulation’, in order to assimiliate its gender to the cows. It might even be based on a putative *bráhmn-ī-, like rā́jan- / rā́jñī, with simplification of the impossible cluster *-hmn-.
