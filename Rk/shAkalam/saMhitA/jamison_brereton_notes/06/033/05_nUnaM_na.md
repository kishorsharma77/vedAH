I do not see any difference in sense between the imperatival injunc. bhūḥ of 4b and the pres. impv. bhávā in 5b.

With Old, who argues this at length, I take the Saṃhitā mṛḷīká as loc. mṛḷīké, rather than Pp. mṛḷīkáḥ. See also Klein, DGRV I.314. The conjunction utá, which connects it with clear loc. abhíṣṭau, strongly supports this interpr. (Ge’s interpr. is not clear.) The opening of the 2nd hemistich, itthā́PARTICIPLE, matches that of the opening of the last hemistich in the preceding hymn (VI.32.5), and the diví opening pāda d resembles divé-dive in the same position in VI.32.5.

The final pāda has a bad cadence: goṣátamaḥ. As MLW points out, this form should really be *goṣātamaḥ (splv. to goṣā́-). Such a reading doesn’t improve the expected Triṣṭubh cadence, but it would provide a proper Jagatī cadence (and metrical variety at the end of a hymn is not unexpected). The pāda can be read with 12 syllables without difficulty: diví ṣ i yāma pārye *goṣātamaḥ. As for the transmitted short vowel form, it might have been changed to match nṛtama in 3d, although, as noted there, the light initial syllable of that form is itself. metrically problematic.
