The hero whom Agni bestows here is the concrete realization of the help (ávas-) sought in vss. 1 and 3.

The standard interpr. (though not Gr) construe śávasaḥ with bhiyā́“with fear of his vast power.” This is certainly possible, but a construction with saṃcákṣi seems equally possible and the adjacency of the two words (though across a pāda boundary) very weakly supports my interpr.
