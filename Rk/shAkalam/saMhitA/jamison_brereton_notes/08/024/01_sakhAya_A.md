Ge takes stuṣé here as an infinitive, but the nearby parallels he cites (VIII.21.9, 23.7) are unaccented and clearly 1st person. The switch between 1st pl. (ā́ śiṣāmahi) and 1st sg. (stuṣé) is not unusual in this kind of context, where the poet speaks in the 1st plural jointly for himself and his fellow ritual performers and in the 1st singular for himself alone, with a 2nd pl. address to those same comrades (vaḥ in b).
