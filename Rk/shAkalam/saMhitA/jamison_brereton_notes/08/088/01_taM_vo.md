A neuter word for a verbal product needs to be supplied with bṛhát in a; Ge suggests either bráhma (from 3b) or sā́ma (after Sāy). The latter is more likely, since sāmans are sung (cf. VIII.98.1 índrāya sā́ma gāyata, which is almost identical to our pāda), and since loc. sā́man is found in the last verse, 7c, it produces an implicit ring.
