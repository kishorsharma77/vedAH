The pl. verb junánti in c has two singular subjects, Agni and Sarasvatī, which should trigger a dual verb, or else a singular one as in 2ab. Since Agni and Sarasvatī do not form a stable set of gods (as, e.g., Varuṇa, Mitra, and Aryaman do), it is not clear what god or gods should be supplied to justify the plural verb. Re adds a parenthetical “(et autres)”; possibly the Maruts addressed in the first hemistich? With Ge and Re, I take tásya as a dependent genitive limiting rāyáḥ and referring to the man whom the Maruts, Agni, and Sarasvatī help -- not as a demonstrative adjective with rāyáḥ, which would be grammatically possible.
