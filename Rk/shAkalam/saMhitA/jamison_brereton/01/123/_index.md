Dawn
Kakṣīvant Dairghatamasa
13 verses: triṣṭubh
One of the loveliest of the R̥gvedic Dawn hymns. It begins with references to the  dakṣiṇā or “priestly gifts” distributed at the early-morning sacrifice (vss. 1–6),  almost as if to get the business of the hymn out of the way. But even here the gifts  are clearly under the control of the lovely young Dawn, whose beauties are hinted  at. The next section (vss. 7–9) confronts the usual conundrums and paradoxes

about Dawn (see also I.113 above)—both her twinned opposite number, Night  (vs. 7), and the identity and diversity of the dawns of each individual day (vss.  8–9), each one dutifully conforming to the rules that order the cosmos by per forming her appointed rounds. In the last of these verses (9), Dawn’s daily journey  is likened to a girl’s going to a lovers’ tryst, and this simile provides the transition  to the next two verses (10–11), where she is compared to a beautiful young woman  showing herself off. The final two verses (12–13) combine the gift theme of the  beginning of the hymn with the periodicity of the dawns treated in the middle  section.
