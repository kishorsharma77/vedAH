Another syntactic trick, though far less complex than in the last vs. The first half-vs., describing Viṣṇu’s cosmogonic deed, is couched in the 3rd ps., with the pf. vimamé ‘he measured out’, but in the 2nd half, expressing our present-day desire to live under Viṣṇu’s protection, the god is in the more intimate 2nd ps., in the phrase tásya te, lit. “of this you,” where tásya provides the syntactic pivot to 2nd sg. enclitic te. On such doublings see my “sa figé.” For “hard-pressed Manu” (mánave bādhitā́ya), see the same phrase in VII.91.1, where, as here, a god (or gods) perform(s) a cosmogonic deed that allows the sacrifice to be instituted.
