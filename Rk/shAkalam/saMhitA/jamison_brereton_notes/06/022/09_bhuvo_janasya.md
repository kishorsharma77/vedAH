The lexeme ví dayate is often used positively, of distributing good things to deserving people; cf., e.g., III.2.11 vásu rátnā dáyamāno ví dāśúṣe “distributing goods and treasures to the pious man.” However, a few passages are, or can be, negative, esp. III.34.1 dáyamāno ví śátrūn “fragmenting his rivals” (probably also IV.7.10). Here the dominant sense must be negative and the wiles must be Vṛtra’s (and perhaps those of other enemies) — though a positive spin is just possible as a second reading: “distributing your magic wiles,” that is, deploying his own māyā-s widely. See comm. ad VI.18.9 on Indra’s use of his māyā́-s in combat.
