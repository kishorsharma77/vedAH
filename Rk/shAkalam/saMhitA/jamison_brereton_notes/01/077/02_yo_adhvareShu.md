On the basis of VI.49.6 I most likely want to rethink my interpr. of tám … ā́ kṛṇudhvam from “attract him here” to “make him your own.” See comm. ad loc. Among other things, since “him” is Agni and Agni as ritual fire is already here, we need not attract him here.

The injunc. véḥ (vér in sandhi) is by most analyses a 3rd sg. to the root pres.

to √vī ‘pursue’, despite the -s ending. The same form with the same 3rd ps. value is found in II.5.3 and IV.7.7; see comm. ad locc. I would now be inclined to alter the tr.

to “when Agni … pursues,” to avoid the appearance of an aoristic interpr.

The verse contains yet another example in Gotama’s collection of anomalously accented verbs, here bódhati in the sequence sá cā bódhati. Cf. ā́ca váhāsi (I.74.6), ā́ca huvé (I.76.4), as well as dhákṣi (I.76.3). Although it would be desirable to have a uniform treatment of these verbs, esp. those following X ca, a unitary account does not come to mind, and I have explained them in separate ways.

Here I suggest that we read the adverb sácā at the beginning of d and group it with c (“… pursued the gods altogether”). Lubotsky gives only two examples of lengthened cā, this one and III.57.5, out of over a thousand occurrences of ca, so, as Old (Noten) points out, the form is suspect. Old also considers but rejects a reading sácā, though without giving reasons (beyond “kaum wahrscheinlich”). If sácā goes with the preceding pāda, bódhāti begins a new clause and its accent is correct. Note that in the previous hemistich (2ab), yáḥ …, hótā tám ū … ā́kṛṇudhvam, the second pāda begins with a nom. hótā that likewise belongs to the previous pāda, and a new clause begins with the second word tám, whose clause-initial status is emphasized by following ū.
