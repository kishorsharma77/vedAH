The syntactic function of aghám in pāda a is ambig. It could be an acc. sg.

masc. parallel to agháśaṃsam, the object of yayastu. So Wh (tr. of AV VIII.4.2) “against the evil plotter, the evil …” The pāda break following it might support this reading. However, it can also be a neut. sg., modifying tápuḥ and therefore the subject of yayastu, as in the publ. tr., flg. Ge, followed also by most subsequent tr.

Ge’s cited parallel, VI.62.8, where tápur aghám belong together, seems decisive here.

See also V.3.7, where aghám is used as a weapon against an agháśaṃsa-: ádhī́d aghám agháśaṃse dadhāta “set evil upon him, the speaker of evil.” The simile particle iva in the simile carúr agnivā́m̐iva is postposed, but such late placement of simile markers is not uncommon in the RV.

The hapax anavāyá- is unclear. Old approvingly cites Bergaigne’s gloss ‘qu'on ne peut détourner par des supplications’, and this interpr. seems to inform most subsequent tr., including mine. But this interpr. should rest on the lexeme now understood to be áva √yā ‘appease’, and I do not see how the morphology would work. √yā has a zero-grade ī, but no ay- forms -- but (an-)avāya- can only be broken down into ava+ay-a, containing no elements of √yā/ī. AiG fails to treat this form. Re (EVP XVI.114) tries briefly to get it from áva √ī, but decides that áva √i is “simpler.” This is certainly the case morphologically, but the semantics are harder: áva is not a particularly common preverb with √i and when it appears, the lexeme generally means ‘go down’ (with ‘down’ the physical direction), occasionally more generally ‘go away’. Re cites V.49.5 ávaitu ábhvam, claiming that the verb there means ‘céder’, thus allowing our form to means ‘qui ne cède pas’. But I do not see a ‘cede’ sense in that passage, just ‘go away’. This is, in fact, the interpr. found in RIVELEX (I.181), which glosses the stem anavāyá- as ‘nicht weggehend’ -- ‘not going away’ (metaphorically ‘nicht vergehend, verbleibend’, 181 n. 1) and analyses as a “Verbales Rektionskompositum/Dete<r>minativkompositum” an- + avāya- ‘weggehend’ (< áva + √ay1

-). This must be the correct analysis, though I am sorry to
abandon the richer semantics of a derivation from áva √yā. My publ. tr. ‘unrelenting’ can still probably stand, as a strengthened expression of ‘not going away’. (Note in passing that RIVELEX I.394 [s.v. ay1

-] glosses verbal forms of áva + this root as
‘herabsteigen; Abbitte leisten — descend; apologize’; the second terms of the German and English glosses must result from confusion with áva √yā / ī and should be stricken.) The rendering ‘worm-eater’ for kimīdín- here and in the following vs., as well as in X.87.24, is based on a suggestion of Schindler and Werba recorded in EWA s.v. and also entertained by Scar (41). Note that in X.87.24 it is associated with 139 yātudhā́na- ‘sorcerer’, which stem figures prominently later in our hymn as well as in other parts of X.87.
