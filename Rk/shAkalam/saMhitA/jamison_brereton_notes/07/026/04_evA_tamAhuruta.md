The utá of pāda a is echoed by ūtáyo in c, which in turn is picked up by ūtáye in 5a.

Pāda b opens with ékaḥ ‘one, single’ and c ends with pūrvī́ḥ ‘many’, a contrast that appears to be hightlighted.

The verb saścata in d is morphologically ambiguous. My publ. tr. follows Ge in rendering it as a modal (Ge “… sollen … zufallen,” SWJ “will be companions”).

Ge does not, however, comment on the form. Gr identifies it as a 3rd pl. to an athematic redupl. stem saśc-; since this stem precedes and is distinct from his “schwaches Perf. saśc-,” he must consider it a redupl. pres., as Whitney and Macdonell (VGS) do; Hoffmann (Injunc. 260) likewise calls our form an injunctive.

A 3rd pl. mid. injunc. is certainly possible here, but if we wish to maintain the modal value (which, in fact, is not actually necessary), the injunctive is a small embarrassment, since modal value is fairly rare, and generally limited to particular forms like dhā́s for the injunctive. An alternative would be to take it as a 3rd singular  30 subjunctive, possibly built to the perfect stem. The neut. pl. bhadrā́ṇi … priyā́ṇi could serve as subject to the singular verb in the well-known inherited construction, though it is not overwhelmingly common in the RV. Of course, we would far prefer a primary -te ending for the middle subj., but I do not think secondary -ta is impossible. Alternatively, with an analysis as 3rd plural injunctive, the tr. could be changed to “… are companions to us.”
