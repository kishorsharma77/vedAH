Following Thieme (KZ 92 [1978] 46), kṣoṇi- is literally a ‘shout’ or ‘warcry’. But in the dual it evolves to refer to Heaven and Earth, presumably by way of the long semantic chain ‘(two) opposing war-cries’ à ‘opponents’ à complementary pair à the archetypal complementary pair, i.e. Heaven and Earth.

Though both duals, pitárā and mātárā, can refer to both parents, it is surely no accident that in this tender image of childhood it’s literally “the two mothers” rather than “the two fathers” who pursue the errant toddler.

With Gr and Old I read *śrathayanta for śnathayanta (√śnath ‘pierce’), flg.

Sāy and the Kashmir ms; see Old ad loc. Although Ge retains śnathayanta, in his note he allows for the possibility of the variant reading. As Old points out, the rhyming śnath form could have been introduced because of the mention of enemies. ### 07-08 The verb havāmahe of 8c must be read with both verses (so also Ge) and is a mark of the unity of the pragātha. This pragātha is, furthermore, cunningly constructed, with a number of rhetorical pairs: variants on “X and non-X” are found in 7b prahetā́raṃ áprahitam and 8a iṣkartā́ram ániṣkṛtam, both pairs with the same morphological structure; adjacent rhyming agent nouns jétāram and hétāram in 7c join the other two agent nouns just cited, though with different accent; the negated ppl. átūrtam in 7d (whose root links it to vss. 5-6) matches previously cited áprahitam and ániṣkṛtam; there are several pairs of adjacent compounds with one identical member: ániṣkṛtaṃ sáhaskṛtam (8a) and śatámūtiṃ śatákratum (8b), as well as the pair vásavānaṃ vasūjúvam (8d) with the first an -āna-formation built to vasuwith full-grade of the suffix (for which type see AiG II.2.275); and the second member of śatám-ūtim (8b) picks up ūtī́(7a), whatever the source of the latter (see below). It may also be that the sequence in 7c … jétāraṃ hétāraṃ rathī́tamam playfully evokes a sequence of two comparatives in -tara- culminating in a superlative.

The phrase itá ūtī́(also, as itá ūtī́ḥ I.119.8, I.130.5) cannot be separated from the compound itáūti- (6x). The latter has an apparent Old Avestan cognate utaiiūiti- ‘youthfulness’, probably containing a *yūti- related to yúvan- ‘youth’. The Vedic compound clearly lost its transparency and has undergone some deformation, resulting, finally, in the folk-etymology “help from here / from then on” represented by the phrasal itá ūtí-. Both the compound and the phrase can co-occur with ajára- ‘unaging’ as here; see also I.146.2, X.31.7. For disc. and lit. see EWA s.v. itáūti-.

Here in this Anhangslied it is likely that ūtí- ‘help’ has captured the de-compounded phrase, but that the phrase is still associated with the notion of constancy, hence my compromise “with enduring help.” Ge tr. “zu eurem unmittelbaren (immediate) Beistand,” but in n. allows “den durch Fortdauer (oder Verjüngung) Alterlosen.”
