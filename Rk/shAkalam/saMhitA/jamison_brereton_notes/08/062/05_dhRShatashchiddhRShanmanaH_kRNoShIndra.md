The interpretation of this verse rests on whose mind (mánas-) is at issue.

Ge. considers it to belong to the mortal worshiper and makes it the object of kṛṇóṣi: “Da du … selbst des Kühnen Sinn (noch) kühn(er) machst …,” which also entails interpreting plain dhṛṣát as a comparative. By contrast I consider the mind to be Indra’s and take pāda a as a separate nominal sentence. This has the advantage also of putting yád in b in a more acceptable syntactic position. In V.35.4 the dhṛṣán mánaḥ is unarguably Indra’s; the full expression in I.54.3 dhr̥ṣató dhrṣ̥ án mánaḥ “the bold mind of the bold one” also refers to Indra.

As for the rest of the verse, I take the gen. participles saparyatáḥ (c) and pratibhū́ṣataḥ (d) as genitives of benefit. This has the slight disadvantage of positing different referents for these two participles and for dhṛṣatáḥ in a, but it would hardly be the first time that a RVic verse contained genitives referring to different entities, and there is considerable distance between dhṛṣatáḥ and the others.
