Indra  
Savya Āṅgirasa  
8 verses: jagatī  
The hymn has a weak omphalos shape, with the paired middle verses 4 and 5  contrasting Indra’s central role in peace (4)  and war (5), in parallel syntactic constructions. The hymn begins by describing Indra’s vast size and fierce power  (vss. 1–3) and ends with an appeal to him to come to our sacrifice bearing gifts (vss.  7–8). Despite the emphasis in the hymn on Indra’s martial powers and contrary to  Savya’s usual practice, no particular heroic deeds are recounted or even mentioned  directly; there is simply one indirect allusion to the Vr̥tra myth in the final pāda of  verse 6, which serves as the transition between the omphalos verses and the final  requests.
