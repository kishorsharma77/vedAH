You, Indra, with surpassing wealth for us: greatness will accompany  you, who are so powerful, for our help—(accompany you) like an
ally for great help.
Most powerful rescuer and helper, (you help) every chariot,
immortal one.
Another one than us—any one—should you harm, o possessor of
the stone—(anyone) who (himself) intends harm, o possessor of
the stone.
