Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
4 verses: anuṣṭubh 1–3, br̥hatī 4
Yet another hymn concerned almost entirely with Indra’s soma-drinking, but unlike  the immediately preceding hymns, Indra is not directly urged to come and drink the  soma. Rather, Indra is in the 3rd person throughout, and commands are issued to  a single individual (vss. 1, 4) and to a group (vss. 2–3), to serve Indra. None of the  addressees is identified until verse 4, with its vocative addressing the Adhvaryu. He  is likely therefore also to be the addressee in verse 1; presumably the priests as a  whole are addressed by the plural imperatives in the internal verses.
In this otherwise ritually focused hymn, the very specific anxiety expressed in  the last half-verse comes as some surprise, a surprise mirrored in the meter, with  the 12/8 half-verse contrasting with the 8/8 structure that has prevailed throughout.  This wondering question about Indra’s possible aid against the boastful slanderer  functionally fills the usual hymn-final slot of direct plea to the god for help, despite  its indirection.
