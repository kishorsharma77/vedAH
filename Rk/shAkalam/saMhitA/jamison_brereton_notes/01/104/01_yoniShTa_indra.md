As noted in the publ. intro., s u vānó nā́rvā in b contains a triple pun, since the participle s u vānáḥ can be read in three different ways: 1) as nom. sg. to the adj.

svāná- ‘sounding’ (√svan ‘sound’)(so Old, Re, WG); 2) as athem. med. part. to √sū ‘impel’, used passively (so Ge); 3) as athem. med. part. to √su ‘press’, also used passively (mentioned by Ge in n. 1b). In this last case the simile would compare Indra seating himself on the ritual ground to soma placed at the soma press. The diction in the rest of this hemistich is quite similar to that found in soma hymns. Cf., e.g., IX.70.7 ā́yóniṃ sómaḥ súkrtḁ ṃ ní ṣīdati, with yóni-, a form of √kṛ characterizing it, and the verb ní √sad. In the publ. tr. only the first of these is given, because including a set of bracketed alternatives -- "[/ like a steed having been impelled [/ like (soma) the steed being pressed]" -- seemed disruptive and distracting.

Pāda b contains the word váyaḥ, which raises the same question as in 103.7: is this the plural to ví- ‘bird’ or the neuter sg. s-stem váyas- ‘vitality, vigor’? Neither of them is an entirely natural object to vimúcyā ‘having released’ in this context. Ge (/WG) opt for the latter, Old and Re for the birds. In the publ. tr. I treat it as a pun, but I am not certain what either phrase would represent.

In d váhīyasaḥ is of course a comparative, but, again, so rendering it would be awkward.
