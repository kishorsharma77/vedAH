The sense of the hapax paṅktírādhas- ‘whose gifts come in fives’ is unexplained. It may of course be some ritual reference (and the range of available explanations tends in that direction), but I suggest that it might be a reference to the fingers and mean that gifts come by the handful, that is, abundantly.
