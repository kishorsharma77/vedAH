In the compound rudra-vartanī, number is of course neutralized in the first member. The Maruts are regularly called Rudras (without vṛddhi or derivational suffix) after their father. The ‘course of the Rudra/Maruts’ is simply a reference to the midspace (antarikṣa) much frequented by the Maruts, where the Aśvins are now driving.
