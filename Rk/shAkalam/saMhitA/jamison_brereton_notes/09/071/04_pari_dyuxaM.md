The first hemistich contains two untethered genitives, sáhasaḥ and mádhvaḥ. The first of course evokes the common phrase sūnú- sáhasaḥ “son of strength,” and ‘son’ is easily supplied (see Old, Ge n. 4a, etc.). mádhvaḥ is more problematic. In fact Ge identifies it instead as a nom. pl. fem. (presumably to a stem

*mádhū-? though we might expect trisyllabic reading mádhu
vaḥ) referring to the Apsarases, who in IX.78.3 (which contains the other ex. of the phrase harmyásya sakṣáṇim) do prepare the soma. Despite this parallel, his suggestion has little to recommend it: the Apsarases are not otherwise called ‘sweet, honied’, and mádhu- is so typed as a synonym/descriptor for soma and its gen.-abl. mádhvaḥ so well attested that it is hard to image how an audience could force the fem. pl. interpr. on this word with so little to go on. In the publ. tr. I sneaked it in as parallel to sáhasaḥ, but this is not very satisfactory. Old suggests supplying rásam ‘sap’ or ūrmím ‘wave’, both of which appear with dependent mádhvaḥ, with rása- more common. I would now tr.

“(sap) of honey” (so also Re, Scar 39).

Ge (n. 4b) plausibly suggests that the “secure house” (harmyá-) is the plant’s husk.

The second hemistich depicts a somewhat outlandish situation: cows preparing their milk on the “head” (mūrdhán-) of Soma. IX.93.3 contains a similar picture: cows preparing Soma’s head with milk, using both mūrdhán- and śrīṇanti as here. Both clearly refer to the mixing in of the milk; if the mixing involves pouring the milk into a vessel containing soma, the upper surface of the soma could be considered his “head.” With Ge (fld. by Scar 39), contra Pp., I read dat. suhutā́de not suhutā́daḥ. The dat. would refer to Indra, while the suhutā́daḥ as nom. pl. would modify the cows, who are not typically eaters of oblations, or as abl.-gen. sg. would have no obvious referent. See Old’s efforts in that direction.
