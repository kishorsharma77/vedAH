Agni (or Agni AUṣasa “Agni at Dawn”) 
Kutsa Āṅgirasa  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
A typical puzzle hymn in many ways. The dedicand of the hymn, Agni, does not  appear by name until verse 9, and there are only two occurrences of the name, both  vocatives, in the whole hymn (the second being in the final, summary verse 11). The  address to Agni in verse 9 also breaks the uninterrupted 3rd-person description that  holds sway in the hymn up to that point. In what precedes, Agni’s characteristics,  the ritual service given to him, and the entities that render that service are referred  to in oblique fashion.  
The Anukramaṇī suggests that it is Agni “at dawn” who is the subject of the  hymn, and indeed the hymn is specifically concerned with the birth, that is, the  kindling, of the ritual fire at daybreak. The birth imagery dominates the first verses,  with Night and Dawn suckling Agni as their calf (vs. 1) and the fingers of the offici  
ants begetting him (vs. 2). Three births of Agni are mentioned in verse 3; though  there is some disagreement about whether the three entities mentioned in pāda b are  the sites of the three births, in our opinion only two sites are found there (the sea  and the heavenly waters), and the third birth is the ritual birth that occupied the first  two verses. Again in our opinion, the second half of verse 3 concerns the removal of  the oblation fire (the fire later called the Āhavanīya) to the east.  
The remaining verses of the hymn describe the growing strength of the newly  born fire, first barely visible in the kindling sticks (vs. 4), but with flames rising  higher and higher (see esp. vss. 7–8) as he also spreads across the ground (vss. 8–9).  The expected requests for aid and gifts are rather muted and perfunctory (vss. 9cd  and 11b); the focus is on the riddling descriptions. The hymn displays some omphalos characteristics: the middle verses (5–6) show  responsion, and there is a wisp of a ring in the lexical repetitions between verses 2  and 9. But the omphalos effect is not strong.
