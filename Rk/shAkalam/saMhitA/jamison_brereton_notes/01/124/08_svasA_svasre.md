As indicated in the publ. intro., I believe that this verse continues the series of female portraits, this time with two vignettes of the svayaṃvara (‘self-choice’) marriage.

On the basis of I.113.1, Ge suggests persuasively that the subj. of pāda a is Night and her older sister is Dawn. Nonetheless, I take the subj. of b to be Dawn, who is going away from Night. The crucial word in b is praticákṣyă/ā (latter Pp.), which can be either a gerund (-ă) or a gerundive (-ā). Most (though not Old) take it as the latter, as I do, but with the sense “to be seen again” (e.g., Ge “die man wiedersehen soll”), that is, as one who will return. But this is not the standard meaning of práti √cakṣ, which simply means ‘gaze upon’. Here I think “to be gazed upon” represents the display motif of the svayaṃvara marriage: before the girl exercises her choice among the assembled suitors, she enters the arena (vel sim.) and is announced and displayed for all to see (for disc. see esp. Jamison 1999 [Penelope] and for this passage in general Jamison 2003 [Fs. H.-P. Schmidt], pp. 42-44).

The choosing maidens (vrā́ḥ) of the same marriage type are the topic of pāda d.
