The pāda-final vām here is also in syntactic 2nd position (as it is in 1a), since báḷ itthā́is a extra-clausal exclamation, and the clause proper begins with mahimā́.

For mahimán- with √pan, see nearby VI.75.6, as well as VIII.101.11, X.75.9, etc.

I am puzzled by the pāda-final ā́. Gr (col. 171) classifies it as emphatic after numbers or grades, to show that the number or grade has been reached, but the phrases he lists there are quite heterogenous.
