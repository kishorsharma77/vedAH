The lexeme ápa √bādh appears, as often, in tmesis. This tmesis appears to be regular even when the lexeme appears, as here, in the participle (univerbated as apabā́dhamāna- only in the late X.103.4; in tmesis I.35.3, 90.3, V.80.5, IX.97.43 as well as here). But in our passage ápa is oddly positioned for a preverb in tmesis (which may account for Gr’s failure to register the preverb, as also in V.80.5): immediately following the object and not adjacent to a metrical boundary, … bā́dhamānā, víśvā támāṃsi duritā́pa devī́. Although this aberrant position might suggest that ápa is not a preverb here but a postposition or adverb, this would require separating the expression from the well-attested verbal lexeme, which I prefer not to do. I should however note that in vs. 1b bā́dhamānā támāṃsi is found without ápa.
