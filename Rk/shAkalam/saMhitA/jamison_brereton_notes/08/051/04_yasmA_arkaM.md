Although the first hemistich clearly describes ritual activity, its exact reference is unclear. Ge plausibly suggests that the chant is “seven-headed” (saptáśīrṣānam) because it issues from the mouths of seven priests. “Threefold” could refer to the three pressings of the soma sacrifice or perhaps the three fires, but neither of these interpretations imposes itself. As for the “highest footstep,” see discussion at I.21.6 and I.22.21. The highest footstep is usually Viṣṇu’s, and Viṣṇu does stride his three steps in the immediately following (and twinned) hymn, VIII.52.3. As elsewhere, the “highest footstep” seems to be the celestial counterpart of the ritual ground on earth, and the same types of ritual activities are performed there as on earth.

Ge suggests that the referent of sá in c is the chant, not Indra, but the yásmai … sá construction virtually demands that the referent of sá be the same as that of yásmai, which cannot be the arká-. Indra is the most likely referent of both (though Viṣṇu might be barely possible). Note that no god’s name appears in the verse, leaving the reference apparently deliberately undefined. However, paúṃsya- in d is almost always a characteristic of Indra’s, and both the preceding and following verses (3, 5) open with definitional relative clauses, like that of 4ab, where the relative pronoun is explicitly identified as Indra in the main clause (3c, 5b índraṃ tám), which imposes the same identification here.
