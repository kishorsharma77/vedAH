This vs. has a number of difficulties, both morphologically and syntactically. The most immediate is the first word siṣāsátū (Pp. rightly siṣāsátuḥ). Gr takes it as a nom. sg. m.

adj. built to the desid. (so already Sāy.; cf. AiG II.2.667), fld by Old, Re, and the publ tr.; the alternative solution is to interpr. it as a 3rd dual perfect-like form built to the desid., as suggested by Ludwig, fld. by Ge (see his n. 5a), Ober. (Relig. RV I.537), and Heenen (Desid. 239 + n. 264). I would be more sympathetic to the du. pf. interpr. if there were a clear way to get a dual subject. But the only indication of a subject in this vs. is contained in the 2nd sg. asi at the end of the vs., and the attempt of Ge et al. to invent a dual subject is exceptionally clumsy: by their interpr. Soma, the 2nd sg. referent in asi, is on one side or faction, and there is another side that ought implicitly to contrast with Soma’s side, but somehow doesn’t in his tr. Acdg to Ge, the two sides are racehorses (árvant- in b) and “Beutemacher” (the victors in raids in c). Since the putative desiderative pf. is already anomalous, the contextual melt-down and the multiplying of invisible actors make this an unattractive solution. So, better to deal with the alternative morphological anomaly, a desiderative adj. in -tu- apparently formed to the desid. verbal stem; this adj., as a singular, can easily qualify the sg. subj. of asi. Debrunner (II.2.666-67) cites a few such forms in -tuthat could be associated with a them. pres. stem (though all with suffixal accent, i.e., -tú-).

He suggests that our form is an Ersatz for the -u-adj. siṣāsú- (1x I.102.6), and this seems to me the right path to take, though the details aren’t clear. I would tentatively suggest that it is a blend - or, perhaps better, a remarking - of the two verbal adj. suffixes available to desiderative stems: the normal pres. part. act. in -ant-, well attested to this stem (síṣāsant-, - at-), and the verbal adj. suffix -u- specific to the desid. (as in siṣāsú- just cited). It might be possible to image the addition of the -u-suffix to the weak form of the pres. part. śiṣāsat-.

Unfortunately this founders on the accent, which cannot easily be explained; this is the only advantage of the pf. du. explanation, which would have the correct accent.

Even assuming that siṣāsátuḥ is a desiderative adj., construed with gen. rayīṇā́m in the same pāda, we are not out of the woods, and I am not satisfied with the publ. tr. or with the suggested tr. of Old and Re. The three pādas of the vs. have an apparently parallel structure, esp. the last two. All three contain a gen. pl. - rayīṇā́m ‘of riches’ (a), árvatām ‘of chargers’ (b), and jigyúṣām ‘of winners’ (c); the last two pādas also contain loc. pls., vā́jeṣu ‘at prize contests’ (b) and bháreṣu ‘at raids’ (c). Pāda b is also marked as a simile, with the simile marker iva following the whole simile, not the first word (as also in the last hymn, IX.46.1b). Are all three pādas truly parallel - and in particular should siṣāsatúḥ be understood in b and c, as in a, where it governs rayīṇā́m? Both Old and Re understand siṣāsatúḥ with all three pādas, but take the genitives of b and c in datival function (identifying the groups for which Soma wishes to win riches), not parallel to rayīṇā́m. Cf. “Du bist der Erstreber von Reichtümern, wie für die Renner beim Gewinn der Preise, (so) für die Sieger in den bhára.” This neatly solves the problem that the gen. pl.s of b and c refer not to a substance (wealth) one might strive to win, but to animate beings that might be striving to win it themselves, so the morphologically parallel forms do not seem to be semantically or functionally parallel. My own solution in the publ. tr. is, I now see, considerably inferior to the Old/Re one: I take b with a, but not c, making ‘chargers’ a substance Soma seeks to win and also eliding the simile. I would now reject this interpr. For c in the publ. tr. I made the gen. pl a partitive: “you are among those / (one) of those who are victorious …” Although this interpr. seems a little artificial, I think it’s possible, and I would now interpr. b in the same way - with the whole vs. meaning “Desirous of winning riches, you are (one) of those who are victorious in the raids, as if (you were one) of the chargers at prize-contents.” Alternatively, I would substitute a version of Old/Re: “You seek to win riches for those who are victorious at raids, as if for coursers at prize-contests,” though this seems more awkward.

In any case, the vs. is problematic on several counts and I doubt that any of the suggested interpr. captures the poet’s intent.
