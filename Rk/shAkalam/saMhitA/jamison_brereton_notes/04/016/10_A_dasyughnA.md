Pāda b bhuvát te kútsaḥ sakhyé níkāmaḥ echoes 6b … sákhibhir níkāmaiḥ.

In 6 Indra performs manly deeds “with his eager companions” (either the Maruts of the Vṛtra myth or the Aṅgirases of the Vala myth); here Kutsa must be transformed into such a sidekick by his association with Indra: “In companionship with you, Kutsa will become eager.” On the enigmatic theme of the woman trying to tell Indra and Kutsa apart, see the publ. intro. As argued there, it is likely that the Jaiminīya Brāh. version (JB III.199-202), with sexual mischief between Kutsa and Indra’s wife, facilitated by the identical appearance of Indra and Kutsa, is only a secondary attempt to make sense of this tantalizing snippet and no such story underlies our passage. Certainly the woman (nā́rī) in our passage seems entirely upright and eager to distinguish between the two males.
