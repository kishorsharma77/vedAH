I don’t understand what the Sindhu is doing here. Is it a third place (besides the two in 17ab) where the Aśvins might find exhilaration? Or is it a metaphor for the “good praise” and/or “bright insight” (both fem., as síndhu- is) in vs. 19? The agreements in vocabulary, śveta- and the -yāvan/r-ī- cmpds, speak for the latter, but the former makes more sense to me.
