ṛtáḥ here is one of only two masc. forms of this extraordinarily common neut. stem, the other of which also qualifies kavíḥ (IX.62.30). (Gr’s three masc. acc. ṛtám are actually neut., and the apparent du. masc. ṛtā́appears in X.106, a hymn constructed of gibberish, in vs. 5, which I refused to tr.) In these two passages it must be a secondarily adjectivized application of ṛtá- ‘truth’, facilitated by its past participle shape (and origin). Hence the special-effect tr. ‘entruthed’. Its appearance here may also be motivated in part by the semi-palindromic trātar rtás ̥ . The form ṛtás is unusual also because of its irregular sandhi with following kavíḥ, on which see comm. ad VII.18.2. Curiously the other example of this phrase in IX.62.30 shows the standard sandhi ṛtáḥ kavíḥ.

The trio kaví-, vedhás-, and vípra- recurs from vs. 3. There Agni was both kaví- and vedhás- attended to by vípras; here his attendants are vípras and vedháses, while he remains a kaví-.
