This verse uses some of the material found in the previous hymn, also in Uṣṇih: prā́ci prayaty àdhvaré is a heavy variant of prā́dhvaré (that is, prá adhvaré) of VIII.12.31-33; mímīte is identical to the refrain mímīta íd (12.10-12); ānuṣák occurs in 12.11.

Who is ayám? This near demonstrative should mean that the referent is actually present. It can only be Indra. In the first two verses of the tṛca the focus is on his companions, the Maruts (“who are yours [=Indra]” 28a), and now attention turns to their leader, the subject of the hymn as a whole, and in the finale to the hymn his longed-for epiphany is signalled by this dramatic ayám.

That Indra himself “measures the sacrifice” is consistent with his being urged to “stretch the thread” in 14c above.

Ge’s interpretation of ab is quite different from mine, and seems to envisage the sacrifice receding in the distance as the subject keeps gazing further out towards it. This doesn’t make much sense to me, and the similarity of the expression in b to the cliched prá adhvaré (see just above), which refers to the temporal progress of the ritual (and in this case, perhaps the carrying of the Āhavanīya fire eastward), makes his interpretation unlikely.

The only other occurrence of dīrghā́ya cákṣase is in I.7.3, where Indra puts the sun in the sky for this purpose. See remarks ad loc., where I point out that the expression can be either temporal or locational or both.
