Although most tr. (Ge, Re, Doniger, Maurer, but not Macd) take nānāma as 1st sg., with nom. kumāráḥ relegated to a simile, I follow Kü (278)(and Macd., see also Gr) in taking nānāma as 3rd sg. For one thing, cid isn’t a simile particle (pace Ge), and so this would have to be an unmarked simile (not, of course, impossible), and for another we might expect (or at least hope for) *nānama with short root vowel as a 1st sg. pf. The point of the half-vs. must be that even a little boy knows to honor someone more powerful and distinguished than he is, and so I surely know to do the same.
