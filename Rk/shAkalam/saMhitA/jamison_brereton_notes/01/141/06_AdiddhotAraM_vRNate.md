Another instance of ā́d íd, which seems, in this hymn, to mark the progress of the ritual.

With bhágam iva papṛcā́nāsaḥ in b compare bhágam … papṛcāsi in 11b. The difference of voice is significant: in 6b the mortal officiants “(en)gorge themselves (med.) with/on good fortune” while in 11 Agni engorges (i.e., swells)(act.) good fortune for us.” The similarity of these striking expressions makes it unlikely that bhágam in 6b is primarily the goal/object of ṛñjate, as Ge, Re, WG take it.

The phrase mártaṃ śáṃsam may be a de-compounded version of nárāśáṃsawith lexical substitution. Note that nárāśáṃsa- is found in the next hymn, the Āprī hymn I.142.3. See also devā́nāṃ śā́ṃsam in 11d of this hymn. The double object of véti -- devā́n and mártaṃ śáṃsam -- is a zeugma of sorts, made possible by the fact that √vī can take both animate and inanimate objects.
