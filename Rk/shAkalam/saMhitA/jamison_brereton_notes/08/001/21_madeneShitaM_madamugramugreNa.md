The first three pādas of this verse are couched in the acc. sg. masc. I take them as continuing the last pāda of the previous verse, as objects of yāciṣat (to be supplied from 20d). So also Tichy (195). By contrast, Ge, flg. Old, supplies “(Preiset),” which is certainly possible but not generated from context. The root √yāc takes a double acc.: “beg s.o. for s.th.” Here I assume that mádam of a is what is begged for and ugrám of b qualifies the one begged, namely Indra, as an appositive to ī́śānam ‘master’ in 20d. The referent of tarutā́ram ‘overcomer, triumphant one’ in c is most likely Indra, but it is worth noting that máda- is the referent of tarutár- in VIII.46.8-9.

Why we are begging for máda- ‘exhilaration’, which is a state of Indra’s, not ours, is made clear by pāda d: when Indra is exhilarated, he gives to us.
