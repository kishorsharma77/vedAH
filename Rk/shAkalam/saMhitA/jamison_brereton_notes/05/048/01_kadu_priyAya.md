My interpr. follows that of Old in most particulars, but is also informed by my view that the hymn as a whole is a Dawn hymn (see publ. intro.). I therefore think that in the 1st hemistich the dative recipient of the poets’ compositions is Agni, not, per Old, Varuṇa, nor, per Re, Indra. (Ge and WG do not identify the recipient.) Although the descriptors in b are not strongly typical of Agni, the “own dear foundation” (priyā́ya dhā́m(a)ne) in pāda a would be appropriate for the establishment of the offering fire at the beginning of the morning sacrifice.

With Old I take the subject of cd, identified as feminine by nom. māyínī, as Dawn, and I also follow him in considering the hapax āmenyá- as dissimilated from

*āmemyá-, a thematic nominal deriv. of the intens. to √mī ‘(ex)change’, formed like
vitarturá-, ādardirá-, as he suggests. Modifying rájas- ‘(dusky) realm’, it would express the constantly changing color of the sky at dawn, and is comparable to the intens. part. in I.96.5 náktoṣā́sā várṇam āmém(i)yāne “Night and Dawn, ever exchanging their color,” as Old also points out. Whatever the etymology of māyā́- (whose possessive deriv. māyínī closes the vs.) -- I favor Thieme’s connection with √mī ‘(ex)change’, which, however, is rejected by Mayrhofer (EWA s.v.) -- the polarized initial and final words of the hemistich, #āmenyásya ... māyínī#, provide a phonological and, if Thieme is correct, an etymological frame for the hemistich.

And what happens within that frame? In my view the image is that of dawn in a partly cloudy sky. The conceit is that the rays of Dawn spreading across the cloudy sky look like streams of water -- water that Dawn has appropriated from the cloud (“choosing the waters in the dark cloud” abhrá ām̐apó vṛṇānā́). Since the image makes sense with the transmitted apáḥ ‘waters’, I see no reason to follow Old (and partly WG) in assuming it stands for *ápaḥ ‘work’. The same phrase “choosing the waters” is also found in IX.94.1, though in a very different context. I explain it there as a deliberate poetic deformation of the common expression apó vasāná- “clothing oneself in the waters.”
