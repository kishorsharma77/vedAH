The hapax participle jmāyánt- is clearly built to the adverbial instr. jmā́ belonging to the ‘earth’ word (kṣám-, etc.). The pári preceding it can be read both with the verb īyatuḥ and with jmāyánt-. Cf. párijman- and EWA s.v. As for what it means for a mace to encircle the earth, it is probably a measure of its size, which then indicates that Indra’s hands are even larger because they encircle the mace.
