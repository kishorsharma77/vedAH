I, a knowing one, have yoked myself like a courser to the chariot-pole;  I draw it [/her=ritual wife], which [/who] furthers (the sacrifice?) while  seeking help.  
I do not desire to be released from it [/her], nor to turn back here  again. The knowing one who goes in front will lead straight along  the paths.
