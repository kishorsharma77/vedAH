Unlike 4a where I separate the identically positioned enclitic gen. from the following instr., I do take asya here with krátubhiḥ, which, unlike svadháyā, is frequently found with a gen. With Ge I think the referent is Indra (contra WG, who take it to be Vṛtra-Śuṣṇa).

I take níṣattam as proleptic, depicting Vṛtra’s position after the action of ní jaghāna in the immediately preceding pāda (4d). With Ge I consider 5a essentially a continuation of 4d and supply the same verb.

In b I supply ‘thinking himself’ with amarmáṇaḥ on the basis of 3c and of the almost identical III.32.4cd … viveda, amarmáṇo mányamānasya márma. The verb in b, vidát, is accented because of the following íd (see Gr s.v. íd 5, though there are fewer clear examples than he presents, since many of them are also pāda-initial). The Indra-reference shifts from 3rd to 2nd between the first and second hemistich, but this is scarcely novel.
