A noun needs to be supplied with revátīḥ ‘rich (fem.)’. Old suggests íṣaḥ ‘refreshments’, which works formulaically with the rest of the lexicon in the passage (including the verb in c; cf., e.g., VII.64.3 iṣā́madema, with an instr. as in our yā́bhir madema). Ge’s “Geschenke” (gifts) is not so happy.

sadhamā́da out of sandhi could end in either -e (so Pp., followed by most) or - aḥ. Complicating the decision is the fact that both a thematic stem sadhamā́da- and a root noun sadhamā́d- are well attested. Though most tr. take presumed underlying sadhamā́de as loc. to the thematic stem (Ge “bei dem Mahlgenossen”), I think it possible that it is the dat. of purpose to the root noun. It may be that Re’s “pour le symposion” also assumes such a dative.
