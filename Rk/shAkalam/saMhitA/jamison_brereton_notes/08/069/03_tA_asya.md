The first two pādas seem rather briskly to clear up the uncertainties of the previous verse, or give at least one reading thereof: soma, the cows that give the milk to mix with soma, and Indra (though not by name) are all present, and their relationships are clear.

The connection of the last half of the verse to what precedes is not clear, as Ge also points out. The birth is likely to be that of soma, but why are we now concerned with “the clans of the gods”? I tentatively assume that the gods are awaiting their invitation to the soma-drinking in their usual abodes. Somewhat later in the hymn (11b) all the gods partake of the soma.

There is number discrepancy between pl. triṣú and sg. rocané, as also in the identical pāda in I.105.5b. On the basis of expressions like I.102.8 trī́ṇi rocanā́, V.69.1 trī́rocanā́, I.149.4 trī́rocanā́ni the two words must be construed together and a truncation of rocanéṣu must be assumed. I don’t quite know why, but Bloomfield (RR ad I.105.5) points out that rocané diváḥ is a frequent cadence, and it therefore may have imposed itself formulaically in this phrase. Also the alternation between trī́ and trī́ṇi and rocanā́and rocanā́ni in the formula may have made an alternative rocané to rocanéṣu seem acceptable. In fact loc. pl. rocanéṣu is only attested once.
