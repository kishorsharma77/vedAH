Indra  
Gr̥tsamada  
12 verses: triṣṭubh  
This hymn is a surprisingly straightforward summons to the Adhvaryu priests  to offer the soma and a catalogue of the heroic deeds that have earned Indra the  offerings. Verse 7 is particularly interesting since Kutsa (or Purukutsa), Āyu, and  Atithigva Divodāsa are normally allies rather than enemies of Indra as they are  here. Elsewhere (I.53.10 and VI.18.13), however, Indra appears as an ally of the  little-known ruler named Tūrvayāṇa and helps him defeat these three.
