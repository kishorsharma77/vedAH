Grammatically problematic is the accent on the verb eriré in b, a fact that seems to have been elided in most translations, including mine. Old suggests that the particle áha may have conditioned the accent, but this seems unlikely because áha doesn’t have this effect elsewhere. I would now alter the translation to make vs. 4 syntactically dependent on vs. 3, without an overt subordinator. Thus, “you were born together with the dawns, / (as/when) just after that they once again roused …” Again, though most commentators (save Old) consider this to concern the rebirth of the sun, I think it more likely that Agni/the ritual fire is the object, esp. as erire +/- ní is regularly used of establishing the ritual fire (e.g., I.134.4). As for c, the service to the ritual fire of the unnamed subjects (=Aṅgirases?) would account for their receiving a name worthy of the sacrifice; see, e.g., I.72.3.
