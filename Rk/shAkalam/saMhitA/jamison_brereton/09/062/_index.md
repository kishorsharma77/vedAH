Soma Pavamāna  
Jamadagni Bhārgava  
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
Though long, this hymn remains focused on the familiar details of the preparation  of the soma, often ennobled by establishing cosmic parallels. The journey across1284 IX.62  
the fleece is especially prominent, and the soma is frequently likened to a fast horse.  One verse, 17, is more specific than the usual generic treatments: here the soma is  a horse yoked to the chariot of the sacrifice, which has three backs and three seats,  presumably the three pressings and the three fires, by the visionary thoughts of the  seven seers. It is also notable how often Soma is called a poet or connected with  poetry in the second part of this hymn (vss. 13, 14, 25, 26, 27, 30). In the final verse  he is in fact called “the entruthed poet” or “the poet (who is) truth (itself),” a power  
ful expression of his relationship to creative speech.  
Though some of the tr̥cas display internal formal unity (e.g., vss. 19–21 begin ning with ā́), most do not. The poet to whom the hymn is attributed names himself  in verse 24.
