The standard tr. all take the ghóṣa- to be emanating from the foes, but the instr. amítraiḥ with śṛṇve should make it an agent of the hearing (“is heard by …”) not a source of the sound. Ge’s (/WG’s) “von” and Re’s supplied “(faite) d’ennemis” show their need to overrule the syntax. I see no reason why it should not be Indra’s battle-cry, striking fear in all who hear it.
