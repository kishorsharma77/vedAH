The form ābhogáya (thus in sandhi) has been much discussed. With Old I take it as a loc. ābhogáye to the same stem (whatever its source) as ābhogáyam in a previous Kutsa hymn, I.110.2. I do not think it is a dative, either in infinitival use or as a dat. obj. parallel to rāyé of the infinitival iṣṭáye.
