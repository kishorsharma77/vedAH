The flying, scattered desires of the poet here and his turn, in a ritual context, to the old ways of doing things reminds us of the opening of III.38, a hymn about the development of a poetic vocation within the age-old tradition, esp. III.38.1cd. In this connection it’s worth noting that our refrain, mahád devā́nām asuratvám ékam, finds an echo in III.38.4c mahát tád vṛ́ṣṇo ásurasya nā́ma “Great is that name of the bull, the lord.” Ge also appositely adduces VI.9.6, also about a poet’s training and his selfconscious assumption of the mantle of tradition, with his inspiration deriving from the ritual fire.

The ṛtá- that we wish to speak may again be the refrain that follows immediately.
