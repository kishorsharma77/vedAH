The fem. pl. nī́cīḥ has almost too many possible referents -- waters, flames, cows, or butter offerings (configured as cows) - all of which have been proposed by one or more tr. I favor butter offerings. See also VIII.101.13, also containing nī́cī and showing the same range of possibilities; sim. V.44.4. The cows of c may well be the same offerings metaphorically.

See intro. for the ring compositional final pāda. As Re points out, svàr dṛ́śīke is a nominalizing extension of the infinitive phrase svàr drś̥ é “to see the sun,” and we need not try to interpret svàr as a genitive.
