On the basis of tváṣṭā … viśvárūpaḥ in the preceding hymn (III.55.19) I take the subj. here to be Tvaṣṭar. Since Tvaṣṭar has a large role in the shaping and begetting of offspring, the identification makes sense in this context.

As Ge (et al.) points out, the deriv. pājasyà- at the beginning of the Bṛhad Āraṇyaka Up. (ŚBM X.6.4.1) in the list of the body parts of the sacrificial horse seems to refer to the underbelly: dyaúṣ prṣṭḥ ̥ ám antárikṣam udáraṃ prthiv ̥ ī́pājasyàm díśaḥ pārśvé ... “heaven its back, midspace its belly, earth the underbelly, directions its flanks …,” which accounts for the standard tr. here ‘having three bellies’.

However, here in this passage with polarized gender and a sexual tone, I think it should also contrast explicitly with tryudhā́(better *tryūdhā; see Old, who explains the shortening on the basis of following purudhá) ‘having three udders’. On a fourlegged animal the underbelly would be the part that sags behind the ribcage, where on a female paśu the udder would be. The corresponding male body part located there would be the groin, hence my tr. The image is the common one of the ur- creator as androgynous. See III.38.4-7, a deeply enigmatic hymn in this same maṇḍala, where the creator is also both a bull and viśvárūpa-.

In c I suggest that patyate may be ambiguous between ‘be master’ and ‘be husband’ (on the basis of páti-, which of course means both) because of the sexual activity in d.
