Agni
Kings Tryaruṇa Traivr̥ṣṇa, Trasadasyu Paurukutsya, and Aśvamedha Bhārata, or  Atri Bhauma
6 verses: triṣṭubh 1–3, anuṣṭubh 4–6, arranged in trcas ̥
This hymn consists of two tr̥cas, so it is in its proper place according to its length.  Nonetheless, Oldenberg (Noten and 1897) regards it as an addition to the original  collection.
The hymn is a dānastuti addressed to allied patrons or kings. The Anukramaṇī names three patrons, but, as Oldenberg (1897) and Geldner suggest, Tryaruṇa  might be a descendant of Trasadasyu and bear his name as an epithet (vs. 3). If so,  then the hymn addresses two men, Tryaruṇa (vss. 1–3 in triṣṭubh) and Aśvamedha  (vss. 4–6 in anuṣṭubh). In verse 4 Tryaruṇa commands Aśvamedha to reward the  poet, but it remains unclear just how the two are related.
The translation and interpretation of the hymn become difficult especially at  verse 3, which is open to a number of different constructions. We understand 3ab  to mean that the sacrificer desires Agni’s favor for the poet’s hymn. Why he should  desire this favor navamám “for the ninth time” is not stated, but there is a parallel in  VIII.24.23, which calls on the poet to praise daśamám “a tenth time.” In both verses  the numbers may simply indicate “many times.” Here in this hymn, however, it is  likely that navamám, especially because it follows náviṣṭhāya “for the newest,” either  means “anew” rather than “ninth” or puns on the two meanings. The “harnessed  chariot,” with which Tryaruṇa welcomes the poet’s song in 3cd, may be a gift to the  poet, or it may be the sacrifice itself, which elsewhere is represented as a chariot.
Verse 4 begins the second tr̥ca, a transition that is marked also by a change in  meter. But in contrast to the clear segmentation of the hymn shown by the tr̥ca form  and the meter, the syntax binds verse 4 with verse 3, since the opening relative clause  is coordinate with the relative clause in 3cd. This may reproduce the relationship  between Tryaruṇa and Aśvamedha, who are two individuals but who are in some  manner bound to one another. 1. The lord of settlements has readied for me two oxen together with an  ox-cart—he, the most illustrious lord, more (illustrious) than (any
other) generous patron.
Tryaruṇa, son of Trivr̥ṣan, is illustrious through his tens of thousands  (of cattle), o Agni Vaiśvānara.
## 2
To him who gives to me a hundred and twenty cattle and two harnessed  fallow bays, compliant to the chariot-pole—
to Tryaruṇa offer protection, o Agni Vaiśvānara, o you who are well  praised and grown strong.
## 3
In this way, o Agni, Trasadasyu [=Tryaruṇa] is desiring your favor for the  newest (hymn) for the ninth time—
Tryaruṇa, who welcomes with a harnessed (chariot) the many songs of  mine for (you), the one powerfully born;
## 4
(Tryaruṇa), who will declare thus to my patron Aśvamedha:
“Let him [=Aśvamedha] give to (the poet) questing for gain by his verse;  let him give to the one who seeks the truth, (questing for) wisdom.”
## 5
(Such are) the gifts of Aśvamedha, whose hundred gray bulls
excite me like soma juices with their three additions [=milk, curds,
barley].
## 6
O Indra and Agni, keep an abundance of heroes with Aśvamedha, the  giver of a hundred (cattle),
and (keep with him) dominion, lofty and unaging like the sun in heaven.
