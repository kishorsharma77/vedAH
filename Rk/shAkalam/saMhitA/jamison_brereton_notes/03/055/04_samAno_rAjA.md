The ví … purutrā́of the preceding vs. (3a) returns here, though with the preverb bound to a ppl. (víbhṛtaḥ); the phrase is contrasted with samāná- to express the theme of unity and diversity in balance. The “common king” is of course Agni, and the image is both of this single god being found on many different ritual grounds and of the ritual fire on any particular ritual ground being divided into three.

With Ge, I assume that the pair in c is the kindling sticks. Cf. III.31.2d and X.27.14b, esp. tasthaú mātā́“the mother stands still,” comparable to our kṣéti mātā́ “the mother rests peacefully.” The epithet ‘having two mothers’ (dvimātár-) used of Agni in 6a and 7a is a reference to the paired kindling sticks.
