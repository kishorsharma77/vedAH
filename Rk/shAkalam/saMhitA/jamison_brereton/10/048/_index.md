Indra Vaikuṇthạ  
Indra Vaikuṇṭha  
11 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 7, 10–11  
As noted immediately above, X.48 and 49 present themselves as Indra’s self-praise  (ātmastuti, on which see Thompson 1997). They are spoken in the 1st person, with  insistent 1st-person pronouns and verbs. In this hymn only verse 10 lacks an explicit  1st-person form, and the first verses especially establish the pattern: each pāda of  verse 1 begins with a 1st-person pronoun (ahám, ahám, mā́m, ahám), as does each  half-verse of verse 2 (ahám, ahám), and again, each pāda of verse 3 (máhyam, máyi,  máma, mā́m). (Of the 1st-person singular pronominal paradigm, only instrumental  máyā and ablative mát are absent from this hymn, and both are poorly attested in  the R̥gveda [three and twelve times respectively].)  
The contents of the self-praise range over Indra’s many accomplishments, but  especially focus on his victories in battle and what he has won thereby—a warrior’s  boast, in other words. Some of the exploits are obscure, indeed mentioned only here  (e.g., vs. 8).  
The only verse lacking 1st-person reference, verse 10, appears to be a riddle,  with a balanced opposition between the good or successful man (?), who has soma  within, and his opposite number, whose failure is exposed by his lack of soma. But  this interpretation must remain tentative, given the puzzles in that verse.
