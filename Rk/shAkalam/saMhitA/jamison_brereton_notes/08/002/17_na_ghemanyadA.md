In b I follow a suggestion of Re’s (EVP 13.98, ad IV.6.4) in interpreting the hapax náviṣṭau as ná *viṣṭaú, with the only emendation the accenting of the second word. Cf. I.92.3 árcanti nā́rīr apáso ná viṣṭíbhiḥ “They chant like women busy with their labors.” Old explains it rather as a haplology of *návaviṣṭi- ‘new labor’ (also Re’s 1st suggestion), and he is followed by Ge “bei der Neuheit des Dichterwerkes,” taking apásaḥ as a gen. sg. But by its accent apásaḥ should mean ‘worker’, not ‘work’. Kü (p. 297) also follows Old, but, taking account of the accent, tr. “beim neuen Wirken des Künstlers.” In the publ. tr. “at their labor” should be preceded by an asterisk.
