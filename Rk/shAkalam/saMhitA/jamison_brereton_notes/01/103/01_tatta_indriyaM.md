On the interpr. of this verse, see publ. intro. Although my interpr. generally follows Ge et al., I take the first two pādas as referring disjunctively to the two locations of Indra’s power (not just to the heavenly one), an idea that is more straightforwardly expressed in c, which I consider grammatically connected to ab.

For the notion in d of a ketú- linking heaven and earth, see III.55.2 and VII.9.1. Despite its position I take iva as marking the following ketú- as a simile.
