On the mixture of myth and ritual in this vs., see publ. intro. Given the fem.

subj. prn. sā́, the mythological allusion to Saramā would be available to the audience on the basis of the phrase gā́viveda “found the cows”; cf. V.45.7 sarámā gā́ avindat, .8 sarámā vidat gā́ḥ -- though it must be admitted that gā́ḥ √vid has other gods as subject elsewhere. See comm. ad V.29.3.
