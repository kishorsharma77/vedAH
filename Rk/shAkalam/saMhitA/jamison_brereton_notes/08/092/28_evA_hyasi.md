Klein (318) takes utá as linking śū́raḥ and sthiráḥ “Certainly (thou art) heroic and firm,” but this assumes that śū́ra- can be adjectival, which, pace Gr, I don’t. Instead, despite its position, I take the utá as conjoining vīrayúḥ and śū́raḥ … sthiráḥ, a variant on the complementary pairing of vīrá- ‘hero’ and śū́ra- ‘champion’.
