The problem of the sg. voc. aṅgiraḥ is treated by Old.

The verb niraṇyáthaḥ is also problematic; in fact Ge declines to tr. it. Re suggests that it might be a corruption of *ni(r)-riṇīthaḥ to nír √rī ‘let flow, let escape’, but the corruption involved would have to be fairly massive and would be unmotivated. Old sees it as a denom. to a form derived from √ran ‘take pleasure’.

WG tr. “ihr … innerlich Freude habt,” following Gotō 1987: 258 n. 582, who accepts Gr’s connection with √ran ‘take pleasure’, though he attributes the accentuation not to a passive stem raṇyá- (as Gr does, despite the active ending) but to a shift from the standard pres. stem ráṇya- by association with denominatives like turaṇyá- (or perhaps to its being a denominative itself). This analysis is accepted by Kulikov (Vedic -ya-presents, pp. 605-5), with further discussion. Although a connection with √ran makes more sense than Re’s suggestion, it does not make much sense in context -- or rather, although the tr. is harmless and not jarring, it has nothing to do with the Vala myth treated in the following pāda. It is also the case that √ran does not otherwise occur with ní and forms of this root are also almost always construed with a source from which the pleasure is derived. By contrast, my tr. follows a suggestion of Brereton’s that it is haplologized from *nirayaṇa-yá- ‘seek/find a way out'. Despite the further machinery required, this interpr. makes more sense in the Vala myth context.
