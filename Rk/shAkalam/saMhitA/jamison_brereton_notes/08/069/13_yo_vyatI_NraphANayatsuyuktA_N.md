Interpretations of this verse vary, and cd is characterized as “dunkel” by both Ge and Old. I take the verse as a series of relative clauses referring to (unnamed) Indra, leading up to the proclamation of Indra in 14ab. The relative clauses are interrupted by an exclamatory tád íd vápuḥ “just this is the marvel!” in c.

Ge takes takváḥ as a PN (rejected by Mayr. PN; see also EWA s.v. TAK), but I see no reason to separate the stem from tákvan-, takva-vī́-, and takvavī́ya-, all of which seem to refer to the movements of birds of prey.

I take upamā́(so Pp., or upamā́ḥ) in the same way as in I.31.15, viz., as a root noun compound ‘measure’. See disc. there.
