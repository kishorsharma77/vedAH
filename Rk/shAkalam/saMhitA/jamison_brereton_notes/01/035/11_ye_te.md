Although it is possible to construe c directly with d, it seems best, following Ge, to supply a verb of motion in c. The d pāda has a close parallel in I.114.10, suggesting that it is independent.

Note the unusual duplication of the nominal referent in both rel. and main clause: yé … pánthāḥ … / tébhiḥ … pathíbhiḥ.
