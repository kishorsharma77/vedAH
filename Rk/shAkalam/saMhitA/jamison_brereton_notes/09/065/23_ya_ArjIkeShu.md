Ge and Re (see also Mayr. PN s.vv.) take ārjīkéṣu and kṛ́tvasu as referring to peoples. On ārjīká- see comm. ad VIII.7.29 and Thieme, Unters. p. 40 n. 2. As for kṛ́tvan-, since in its other two occurrences in the RV (VIII.24.25, X.144.3) it is adjectival, in the meaning ‘active, enterprising’, I see no reason why it should be a proper noun only here. I was tempted to tr. it “ritually active,” but this came uncomfortably close to “sexually active.” As for pastyā̀- as ‘dwelling place’, rather than ‘river’ (Ge, Re, etc.), see comm. ad I.40.7 and IX.97.18.
