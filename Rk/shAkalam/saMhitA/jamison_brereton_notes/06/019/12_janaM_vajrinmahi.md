Note a different kind of gender mismatch in pāda a. Though in the idiom with √man “consider oneself X” / “be considered as X,” X is in the same case as the underlying subject (see, e.g., 7c maṃsīmahi jigīvāṃsaḥ “we could be considered victors”), here it is construed with an adverbial neut. máhi. That this is not necessarily a property of “think oneself great” is shown by I.178.5, VII.98.4 maható mányamānān “… those thinking themselves great,” with acc. pl. matching the subject of the participle.
