Heaven and Earth
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
3 verses: triṣṭubh
Heaven and Earth here figure just as objects of worship, not as physically conceived  entities. Verses 1–2 emphasize their antiquity and the antiquity of the poetic cel ebration of them, while verse 3 asks, as usual, for their gifts.
## 1
I urgently invoke Heaven and Earth, the lofty ones worthy of the  sacrifice, with sacrifices and acts of reverence,
for the ancient poets who also hymned them set in front those two great  ones whose sons are the gods.
## 2
With newer hymns bring forward into the seat of truth the two
ancient-born parents.
O Heaven and Earth, journey here to us with the divine folk. Great is  your protection.
## 3
And because there exist many occasions for you to provide treasures to  the good giver [/Sudās], o Heaven and Earth,
provide for us something that will not be stunted. – Do you protect us  always with your blessings.
