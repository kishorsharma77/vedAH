The phrase kṛṇvánto víśvam ā́ryam “making it all Ārya,” esp. in conjunction with aptúraḥ “crossing the waters,” most likely alludes to the Ārya expansion in their migration into the northern part of the subcontinent, specifically to crossing frontier rivers and laying claim to the land on the other side. This territorial expansion is implicitly compared here to Soma’s ritual journey. Since, as Ge notes (n. 5b), the Soma cult is specifically Ārya, importing this practice into new lands would be a key part of the process of Arya-ization.
