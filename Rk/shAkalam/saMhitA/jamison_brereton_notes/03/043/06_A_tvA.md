The final word of this vs., mūrā́ḥ, is generally taken as distinct from mūrá- ‘stupid, foolish’ and as an acc. pl. fem. with ā́tāḥ (e.g., Ge “die verschlossenen (?) Töre”). I follow Old’s final suggestion that it belongs to the normal stem mūrá- and refers to the horses; English “dumb beast” is a reasonable analogue.
