As Ge point out (n. 14a), the “many shapes” (purú várpāṃsi) that Indra knows could either be his own (given his penchant for shape-shifting) or those of the various demonic enemies he destroys. I assume that the poet meant to leave it ambiguous, though it’s worth noting that the one instance of the bahuvrīhi puruvárpas- refers to Indra (though in the late hymn X.120.6).

The hapax -si impv. hoṣi has no structural support in the RV, the only aor.

attested being the pass. aor. áhāvi. However, an act. s-aor. is reasonably well attested in Vedic prose, beginning with the BYV Saṃhitās (ahauṣīt, etc.); see Narten (Sig.Aor. 288). It is difficult to know whether yoṣi is indirect evidence for a s-aor.

subjunctive to this aor., *hoṣat, etc., to which hoṣi would ultimately belong, or whether it was created as a nonce beside the other -si impvs. in this ritual sphere such as yákṣi, mátsi and has nothing to do with the aor. forms in prose. I weakly favor the latter explanation.
