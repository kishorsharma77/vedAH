Agni Tāpasa
6 verses: anuṣṭubh
This simple hymn continues the message of the immediately preceding one, but  with far less subtlety. The poet calls upon Agni (vss. 1, 3, 6, and implicitly 5) and  an array of other gods, particularly Br̥haspati (vss. 2–5), to ensure that he and his  fellow officiants are well rewarded for their ritual service. The focus on Agni and  Br̥haspati clearly reflects the ritual orientation of the hymn, with Agni representing  the physical activity of sacrifice and Br̥haspati the verbal portion.
## 1
O Agni, address us here; facing us, become well-disposed to us.
Provide for us, Lord of the Clan. You are a prize-giver to us.
## 2
Let Aryaman provide for us, let Bhaga, let Br̥haspati,
let the gods and let Liberality. Let the goddess give riches to us.
## 3
On King Soma for help, on Agni we call with hymns,
on the Ādityas, on Viṣṇu, on Sūrya, and on Br̥haspati the formulator. 4. On Indra and Vāyu, easy to call, on Br̥haspati we call here,
so that every person will be well-disposed to us on meeting.
## 5
Spur on Aryaman, Br̥haspati, and Indra to give—
Wind, Viṣṇu, Sarasvatī, and Savitar the prizewinner.
## 6
You, Agni, with your fires, strengthen our sacred formulation and the  sacrifice.
You, spur on the divine assemblage to give wealth to us.
