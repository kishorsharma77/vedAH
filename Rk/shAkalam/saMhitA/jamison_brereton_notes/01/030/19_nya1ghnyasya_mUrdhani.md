Other passages also depict the Aśvins’ chariot with one wheel at rest (presumably on earth, on the ritual ground) and the other in motion (V.73.3, VIII.22.4), as Ge explains in his note.

The “head of the inviolable (bull)” is somewhat opaque, but is probably a mystical expression for the ritual ground - more clearly expressed in mūrdhán yajñásya “on the head of the sacrifice” (II.3.2, IX.17.6). Others have speculated that the whole complex (the two wheels and the bull’s head) refer to a constellation. See WG n.
