Both Ge and Re supply ‘gods’ as the underlying object of vītáye, and this is supported by devávītaye in vs. 7 (and 41). But as in the previous hymn (VI.15.1, 14), I think the default object of √vī here is havyá-, suggested by the name Vīta-havya, the poet to whom VI.15 is ascribed. Here the havyá- can easily be extracted from the parallel purpose dative havyá-dātaye in b and its absence explained as gapping.

However, the Ge/Re solution is certainly possible, and there are no major implications either way.
