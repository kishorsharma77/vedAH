The pl. subj. of mahayan in pāda is unclear; the most likely referent would be the priestly colleagues of the 1st ps. sg. poet subj. of huvé in 2d; in this spirit Ge supplies “die Sänger,” Re “les chanteurs.” However, Old adduces the almost identical passage VII.61.6 sám u vāṃ yajñám mahayaṃ námobhiḥ with 1st sg.

mahayam. Noting that small differences between otherwise identical passages are common, he does not insist on the 1st sg. interpr. However, given the 1st sg. of 2d, I am now inclined to consider this a strong possibility, and would emend the translation (or at least provide as an alternative): “I magnify the sacrifice for you all …” This makes the interpr. of vaḥ easier: as is common with such enclitics in ritual context, vaḥ should refer to the rest of the officiants, but if they are also the 3rd ps.

subjects of mahayan, this produces a clash. The emendation of -n to -ṃ is of course trivial.

The prá of vs. 1 returns in d, though in the common idiom prá √ric ‘project, extend beyond, surpass’. The medial pf. of this root, acdg. to Kü (426-27), is always presential and has the stative sense ‘hervorhinausragen über Abl.” The ablative is of course missing here. In our passage I think the sense is primarily physical: the ritual fire is gaining strength and its flames project outward on the ritual ground (“in the nearness” upāké), though the fire’s surpassing superiority may also be referenced.

The physical image is found, differently expressed, in the companion hymn VII.42 in vs. 2d ūrdhvā́śocī́ṃṣi … asthuḥ “The flames have stood up erect.” Given the prá here, this might be taken as a reference to the movement of the ritual fire to the east, but the fire seems to me to be already established in its location.

Both Ge and Re supply a ‘speech’ element to their interpr. of mandrá-, “wohlredende” and “à la voix-harmonieuse” respectively, but its derivation from √ma(n)d ‘exhilarate/be exhilarated / gladden/be glad’ does not suggest or require such a semantic extension. It is true that the adj. regularly modifies jihvā́- / juhū́- ‘tongue’ and is also found in the bahuvrīhi mandrá-jihva- ‘having mandrá tongue(s)’.

But generally when Agni’s tongue is mentioned, it is as the instrument for eating the oblation and conveying it to the gods, not as a speech organ. His tongue is gladdening because it gives the gods pleasing nourishment. Agni himself is very often mandrá- as well, as in our passage -- probably for at least two reasons: 1) like his tongue, he is the conveyor of the oblation to the gods, 2) he produces general gladness by his presence and role in the sacrifice. Both factors are probably at issue here: in c he is commanded to sacrifice to the gods (thus conveying the oblation to 70 them); in vs. 4, esp. d, he gives “a desirable reward” to the mortals whose dwelling he is established in.
