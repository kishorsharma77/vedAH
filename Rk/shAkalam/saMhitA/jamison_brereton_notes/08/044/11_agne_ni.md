With Ge I supply daha in b, with the preverb práti, since práti is not otherwise found with √pā, the verb of pāda a, but is common with √dah ‘burn’. Cf. esp. I.12.15 práti ṣma ríṣataḥ daha. VII.15.13b is identical to our pāda, and the verb in pāda c of that vs. is daha, which governs the acc. in b.
