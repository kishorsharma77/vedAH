The ma- phonetic figure that dominated 4d returns in this vs.: cd … mamátur …, … mahimā́nam mamā́te. This figure is reinforced by the first words of pāda a, yájāma ín námasā, and the uninterrupted sequence of -am acc. singulars in ab: … vṛddhám índram, bṛhántam ṛṣvám ajáram yúvānam. Although a side-effect of the grammar, it is my impression that a skilled RVic poet would break the monotony of such a string -- unless it served some other poetic purpose, here to provide the mirror-image -am to ma- and perhaps to evoke the Maruts.

The two forms of the perfect to √mā ‘measure’ in the 2nd hemistich, act.

mamátuḥ and med. mamā́te, share the same subj. and obj., with the 1st clause positive and the second negated. Clearly the poet is playing with two different senses of √mā.

Gr, Ge, and Old neatly convert the word play to “messen” (‘measure’) versus “ermessen” (‘gauge, grasp, realize’)(or so I understand them). My “measure” / “measure up to” is a similar attempt whose purport is close to Kü (378) and WG: “sich messen.”
