Indra This hymn is something of a bricolage, with numerous phrases, pādas, and whole verses borrowed from elsewhere. (I say “borrowed” rather than the more neutral “parallel to,” because the sheer number of the matches strongly suggests that there is a magpie quality to the construction of this hymn. For details of the matches, see Ge’s nn. (though he doesn’t note all of them) and Bloomfield RR.
