All standard tr. take ná as negating the verb aceti. It seems unlikely to me that an annunciatory aorist would be negated (“this very thing has not just been seen”), and its clause-internal position, not immediately preceding the verb, also seems unusual for such an interpretation. I take it instead as negating only the following word yójanam and expressing the surprise that what has just appeared is very close, not (even) a trek away.

I thus take yójana- as a measure of distance, as it generally is, rather than as “Gespann,” with most tr. Rather than yójanam I take the referent of etát tyát to be the formulation (bráhma) that the Gotamas made in the previous verse. This formulation, also referred to as a dhī́- ‘insight’ in 4b, providentially appears at the same moment as the Maruts approach. In what sense does the formulation “appear”? I interpret this verb to mean that the poem that Gotama created in private (sasvár 5b) is now being performed in public (i.e., at the ritual welcoming the Maruts). This interpretation also entails supplying the verb “made” in 5b (echoing kṛṇvantaḥ in 4c), rather than “saw” (with most tr., anticipating páśyan 5c).

My last departure from the standard tr. in this verse is in taking the acc. pl.

masculines in cd, híraṇyacakrān, áyodaṃṣṭrān … varā́hūn as comprising two separate but conjoined NPs without overt conjunction (as so often), rather than one single NP, since I find “golden-wheeled boars” an unlikely entity even in the RVic universe of discourse. With ‘golden-wheeled’ in c it is natural to supply ‘chariots’; the “copper-tusked boars” in d can easily be an extravagant characterization of the Maruts.
