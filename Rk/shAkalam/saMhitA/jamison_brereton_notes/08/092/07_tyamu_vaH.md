I’m not entirely sure of the sense of ā́yatam in b. Ge tr. “auf alle Lobreden Gespannten” (intent on / excited about), which makes nice contextual sense, but which I find difficult to reconcile with the other occurrences of ā́√yam, including, in this hymn, ā́yamat in 3c and (abhí) … ā́yaman in 31b. Elsewhere ā́√yam means ‘to hold (reins, etc.), hold fast, guide’. Here the sense may be that Indra is held (that is, kept) at the sacrifice by our songs, and there is then a contrast between his (temporary) immobility and the rousing we hope to give him (c: ā́cyāvayasi).
