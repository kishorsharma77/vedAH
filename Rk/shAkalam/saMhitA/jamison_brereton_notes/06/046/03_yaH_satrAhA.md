This vs. shows some continuities with the previous pragātha: the root noun cmpd satrāhā́(3a) echoes satrā́in 2d, as satpate (3c) does sátpatim in 1c. There is also the variant 1st pl. mid. root form to √hū/hvā, hūmahe (3b), which contrasts with hávāmahe in 1a. I can see no difference in sense here, and I think there are several other factors at work. On the one hand, extremely common hávāmahe (+/- accent) is almost never pāda-internal, whereas the rare-ish hūmáhe (+/- accent) appears about half the time in that position (but see pāda-final hūmahe in 6b) -- so it partly replicates the bháva/bodhi distribution discussed above. But perhaps more important is that the poet seems to be playing with metrical variants in a way similar to sá tvám discussed above. Pāda b reads índraṃ táṃ hūmahe vayám. There is no good reason for tám because índram more than sufficiently provides the acc. obj.; moreover, all things being equal, tám (and its paradigmatic fellows) generally opens its pāda/clause and in particular does not follow a coreferential noun. The common 1st pl. havāmahe, already found in 1a, would easily fit in a version of this pāda that lacked the tám:

*índraṃ havāmahe vayám. I suggest that the poet called attention to his manipulation
of the variant verb forms by inserting a pleonastic tám, like the pleonastic sá in 2a, and inserting it in the “wrong” place, which would draw the attention of his audience even more.
