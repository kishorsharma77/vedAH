The hapax ātúc- is difficult. See EWA s.v. Mostly for contextual reasons it is generally taken as referring to evening or night, and it has been connected to tvác- ‘skin’, with the sense of ‘covering over’. I have followed this interpr., though with full awareness of how fragile it is. For one thing ‘cover as if with skin’ (which must be the presumed semantic channel, one way or another) is not an altogether compelling way to get to ‘evening’. For another, tvác- ‘skin’ has no zero-grade forms.

Scar (182-83) discusses several possibilities. Besides the ‘covering’ hypothesis, he suggests, citing Schindler and Kü, that tvác- may belong with a root √*tuek̯ ‘sichtbar werden’ to which ātúc- could also belong, and that ātúc- might better be taken as an adj. with madhyáṃdine “when midday is clearly visible.” He is less disturbed than I am that this would leave the verse without a third temporal period; furthermore, given that midday is the most “clearly visible” of the three standard time periods, it seems unnecessary to mark it as such. Another problem with ātúc- is that one is reluctant to separate it from the dat. tucé ‘for progeny’ in 14c. However, it is difficult to connect them and still maintain sensible semantics in our verse. Scar makes a creative attempt: evening is the time when one goes back to one’s children, so ‘zu den Kindern hin’ becomes ‘Rückkehr nach Hause’. I admire the ingenuity but I think the unlikeliness speaks for itself.
