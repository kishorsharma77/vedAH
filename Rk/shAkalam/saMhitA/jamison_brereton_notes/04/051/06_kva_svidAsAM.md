katamā́‘which one?’ echoes purutámam ‘the latest of many’ in 1a. Note that again when a singular dawn is referred to, the word uṣás- is not used.

I do not understand what the Ṛbhus are doing here, nor do I know the exact sense of ví √dhā in the etymological figure vidhā́nā vidadhúḥ. A similar etym. figure is found in nearby IV.55.2 vidhātā́ro ví … dadhuḥ, where I tr. ‘distribute’, which I’ve imported here. However, I am now inclined to think that this has to do with the creative division of an undifferentiated mass (such as the Ṛbhus performed in I.161.2-3 also cited by Ge) and with the regulation of these divisions, possibly of divisions of time. Such “division” contrasts sharply with the lack of distinction among the dawns stated in cd. It is not surprising that a single (unnamed) dawn (pāda a) would be associated with division and distinction (pāda b), as opposed to the plural dawns in the rest of the hymn. For other interpr. of pāda b see the various tr. and comm. ### 07
The opening tā́, esp. in its emphatic form tā́ghā tā́(ḥ) is echoed by the openings of 8 (tā́ā́…) and 9 (tā́(ḥ)).

At the same time sadyáḥ makes an interior ring with 5b around the omphalos vs. What's striking about this little ring is that, though the sadyáḥ in 5 and 7 match verbally, the word is in a different temporal setting in the two vss: present in 5 and remote past in 7, and in 6 those two temporal settings are dissolved or confused (as also in a different way in 4).

The cmpd. ṛtájātasatya- is unusual not only in having 3 members (quite rare in the RV) but also for containing both ṛtá- and satyá-. Re suggests that -satyafunctions as a sort of “particule intensive.” Given how charged both words are in the RV, I think this unlikely, although the rendering in the publ. tr. (“who were really born of truth”) is close to Re’s intensive particle interpr; cf. his own tr.

(“véritablement nées de l’Ordre”). I think the cmpd requires a more literal and weighty rendering -- “whose reality was born from truth” (which I would substitute for what is found in the publ. tr.) -- meaning that the dawns we see and who come daily to our world and our sacrifice, who are really here, arose from the true cosmic patterns that govern the universe of time and space.
