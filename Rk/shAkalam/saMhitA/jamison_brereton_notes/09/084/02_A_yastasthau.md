The territory-winning theme of vs. 1 may be continued here, but on the cosmic level, with Soma mounting all the worlds. This is also probably a reference to Soma as the sun, as Ge suggests (n. 2a).

As noted in the publ. intro., the “knotting and unknotting” probably has both a ritual and a moral reading. Ritually it presumably refers to soma’s passage across the woolly tangles of the sheep’s fleece filter. But Ge cites as potential parallel IX.97.18 granthíṃ ná ví ṣya grathitám …, ṛjúṃ ca gātúṃ vṛjínaṃ ca … “ Untie like a knot the straight and the crooked way (which are) knotted up, when you are being purified,” which implies a moral dimension as well, since “straight” and “crooked” are often used in that sphere.

Pāda d lacks an acc. in the frame to be construed with siṣakti as parallel to uṣásam in the simile. Perhaps the gods in general (the daívyaṃ jánam of 1d and 3d), or the three gods named in 1b, Indra, Varuṇa, and Vāyu. Re supplies Indra, and the parallel he cites, I.56.4 índraṃ síṣakti uṣásaṃ ná sū́ryaḥ, supports this suggestion, esp. since Indra recurs in vss. 3 and 4.
