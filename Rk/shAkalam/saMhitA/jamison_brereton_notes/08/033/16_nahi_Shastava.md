I take the disgruntled speaker to be the poet and the subject of ráṇyati to be a rival ritualist, who has accepted the new doctrine. The “you or me” of pāda a is rather like the English expression “the likes of you and me,” meaning “ordinary people.” I take the nahí … nó (= ná u) as having domain only over táva and máma, not the anyásya of pāda b. By my rules (Jamison 1997) anyá- in this position should be definite (not Ge’s indefinite “oder eines anderen…”), and I take its referent to be Indra. The referent of the yáḥ in the rel. clause in c I again take to be Indra (that is, anyásya), rather than the subject of ráṇyati, as Ge does. The designation vīrá- is of course regularly applied to Indra, and “led us here” can refer both to Indra’s leadership in the acquisition of new territory and to his role in introducing the ritual innovation. And Indra starts off the next verse.
