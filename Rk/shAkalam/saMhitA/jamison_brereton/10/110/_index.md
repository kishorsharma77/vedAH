Āprı̄  
Jamadagni Bhārgava or Rāma Jāmadagnya  
11 verses: triṣṭubh  
One of the ten Āprī hymns in the R̥gveda, structured litanies to be recited at the  animal sacrifice, each verse with its own key word. This hymn follows the stan dard Āprī pattern of course, but is notable for the amount of internal recycling of  phraseology (see the echoes between vss. 2 and 10; 3 and 9; 4, 7, and 10; 4 and 8).  As usual, the key words are italicized.
