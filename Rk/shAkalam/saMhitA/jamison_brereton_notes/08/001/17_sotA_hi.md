Because dhāvata in b is unaccented, it cannot be directly parallel with sótā in pāda a, as, e.g., Ge takes it, because the hí of pāda a should then have domain over b and induce accent on the verb. I take the hí clause as indicating the grounds or prior action needed for the next clause, as so often when hí appears with the imperative (see Brereton 2012). It is also possible that sótā is an injunctive, though clear impv.

sotā in 19b disfavors this interpretation.

On the īm enam doubling see Jamison 2002.

In c I take gavyā́as part of the frame, not the simile, because of the position of iva. Contra Ge, who takes gavyā́vástrā as the simile: “[g]leichsam in Milchgewänder…” dhukṣan should be an injunctive to the sa-aorist found in ádhukṣat, etc., the only reliably attested sigmatic aorist to √duh. It would be appealing to interpret it as a subjunctive to an athematic s-aorist (as the pub tr. “will milk”and Ge’s “wollen … herausmelken” suggest), but it should then have full-grade *dhokṣan.

On vakṣáṇā- ‘belly’ as a pl. tantum, see comm. ad X.27.16.
