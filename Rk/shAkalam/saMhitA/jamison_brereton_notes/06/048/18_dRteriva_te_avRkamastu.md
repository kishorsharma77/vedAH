Ge and Re take the comparison to be between the partnership and the leather bag (e.g., Ge “Deine … Freundschaft soll sein wie der … Schlauch”), but the partnership is in the nom. (sakhyám) and the bag is in the gen. (dṛ́teḥ), as is Pūṣan (te). Given the deep uncertainty of this part of the hymn, grammar is all we have to hold onto, and grammar tells us that it is Pūṣan who is compared to the bag. For the partnership with Pūṣan, see I.138.4fg.
