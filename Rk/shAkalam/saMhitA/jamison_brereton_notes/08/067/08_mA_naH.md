What to supply with mahé is somewhat up in the air, but some equivalent of Ge’s “Glück” seems harmless enough.

I don’t understand Indra’s role here. Is the idea that Varuṇa & Co. should not be getting any ideas about tying us up, because only Indra gets to do such things? But this would run counter to Varuṇa’s role, at least in later Vedic, of binding offenders.

In any case the theme of binding recurs in this hymn; cf. vss. 14, 18.
