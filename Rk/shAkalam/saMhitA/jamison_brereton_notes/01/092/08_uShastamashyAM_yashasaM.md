‘Forelock’ for pravarga- may seem slightly flippant, but I wanted to capture the ‘twist’ sense of prá √vṛj, in contrast to the anodyne ‘having slaves at the front’ found in the other tr.

The final bṛhántam of d obviously refers back to the rayím so carefully detailed in ab, but is separated from that phrase by a considerable amount of material. Rather than making it a long-delayed part of that NP I have taken it as a pseudo-goal with vibhā́si, with vā́ja-prasūtā giving grounds for that goal.
