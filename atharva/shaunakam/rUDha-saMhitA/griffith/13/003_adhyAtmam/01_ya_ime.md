He who engendered these, the earth and heaven, who made the worlds the mantle that he weareth, In whom abide the six wide-spreading regions through which the Bird's keen vision penetrateth, This God is wroth offended by the sinner who wrongs the Brahman who hath gained this knowledge Agitate him, O Rohita; destroy him: entangle in thy snares the Braman's tyrant.
