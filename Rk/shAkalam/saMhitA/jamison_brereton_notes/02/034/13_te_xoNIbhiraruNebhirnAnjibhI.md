As Old noted (see also Hoffmann, Injunk., 121 n. 29), the need for a caesura suggests a reading vṛ́ṣā janayat, rather than the augmented ajanayat of the Pp. (In fact, this suggestion is already found in Gr.) That two pres. indicatives, dhayati and rihanti, follow this proposed injunctive in the same thematic sequence supports interpreting the form contra the Pp, as Hoffmann points out.

The simile anyásyeva .. tanvā̀“as if with the body of another” is, in my view, another reference to the distinction between but ultimate identification of Apām Napāt and Agni.
