There is a sharp split of opinion on the grammatical identity of punarbhúvaḥ. Gr, Scar (361), and the publ. tr. - as well as, probably, Ge (his “immer aufs neue” is not totally clear) - take it as a nom. pl. fem. with the cows and the thoughts; Re and Lü (224-25), the latter cited verbatim by Ober (II.149), as gen. sg.

masc. dependent on sádane and referring to Soma. Not surprisingly Lü is esp.

adamant and sees the whole vs. as a depiction of Soma’s “Aufstieg in den Himmel,” where he is reborn. I am open to either grammatical analysis. The word order might favor the dependence on immed. preceding sádane and thus the gen. sg. interpr. On the other hand, the two other attestations of punarbhū́- are fem. (though neither is pl.), and in conjunction with saṃyátaḥ ‘in uninterrupted array’, it could describe the constantly new, but always similar, sequence of milk-mixtures and hymns in the soma ritual. However, it is possible to adopt the gen. sg. interpr. without subscribing to the journey to heaven: Soma can be considered reborn or regenerated because the pressing has rendered a new substance from the plant. I would therefore entertain an alt. tr. “The cows and thoughts … go together to him in the womb of truth, in the seat of the regenerated (soma),” though I favor the fem. pl.
