The second hemistich has been subject to various interpretations. See, inter alia, Old’s discussion, also Thieme (Fremdl. 42-43). The primary points of difference are the case/number of vipáḥ (gen. sg. or acc. pl.) and of aryáḥ (gen. sg. or acc. pl.), the sense of mā́na- (as also in vs. 2), and the syntactic structure of the final pāda. I opt for gen. sg. vipáḥ (as Old points out, the acc. pl. should be accented vípaḥ), acc. pl. aryáḥ, and the same sense for mā́na- as in vs. 2, namely ‘measure’ - in this case the measure, i.e., the sheer size, of Indra. I construe both genitives (vipáḥ and mā́nasya) with barháṇā, and take the last two words sá kṣáyaḥ as a separate clause, as the position of sá might suggest - contra all other intrepretations I am aware of. It makes sense that Indra should be identified as “peaceful dwelling,” because he has killed the strangers and thus brought peace to the Five Peoples.
