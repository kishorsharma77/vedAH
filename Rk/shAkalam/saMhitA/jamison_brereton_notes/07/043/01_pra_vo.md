The inf. iṣádhyai is a hapax and variously interpr.: e.g., Ge “dass sie gern kommen,” Re “en sorte que (nous) en tirions profit.” The root affiliation is also not entirely clear; e.g., Lub classifies it with √iṣ ‘send’, though we do not of course know how he would tr. it. Both Re’s disc. and his tr. seem to me plausible: he takes it as “un doublet isolé d’iṣayádhyai” and cites Burrow’s (1955) interpr. “pour que nous soyons prospères.” It is worth noting that the few instances of iṣayádhyai (I.183.3=VI.49.5, VI.64.4) also occur in a Triṣṭubh cadence and that that form in isolation is ill-formed for such a cadence, since the root syllable should be heavy in 71 such a cadence. In I.183.3=VI.49.5 this problem is avoided because the root syllable amalgamates with a preceding final vowel: yéna narā nāsati yeṣayádhyai. But in VI.64.4 rayím divo duhitar iṣayádhyai the cadence is simply bad (and in fact produces an uninterrupted run of 5 light syllables). Haplology of the suffix -ayá- to our form iṣádhyai here fixes this metrical problem.

víprā in c, modifying bráhmāṇi, is the only neut. N/A form of this stem, but the stem does modify a different word for thought/poetic formulation, matí-, as fem.

víprā (VII.66.8, VIII.25.24). The Pp. analyzes it instead as nom. pl. m. víprāḥ, which is of course a possible form underlying the sandhi, but which cannot be easily fitted into the sentence. Sāy. does it by sleight of hand: he glosses the first part of pāda c as yeṣāṃ viprāṇāṃ medhāvināṃ brahmāṇi, converting the supposed nom. pl. viprāḥ into a gen. pl., and then supplies viprāḥ as subj. of pra … arcan in the main clause in a: te viprāḥ prārcann pūrveṇa saṃbandhaḥ, an attempt to justify the nom. in the rel.

cl. Needless to say, this doesn’t work.

The verb viyánti in d is ambiguous. With the Pp., Gr., etc., it may be taken as belonging to ví √i ‘go apart, spread out’, but it could also belong to the root pres. of √vī ‘pursue, go in quest’. In a rel. cl. the accent would be the same for either analysis.

Because of the connections between the preceding hymn VII.42 and this one, I favor the latter affiliation on the basis of (prá) vetu in VII.42.1b, but ví √i is certainly not excluded -- and might make slightly better sense with the simile. The tr. might then alternatively read “go apart” for “go questing.” On the other hand, I like the idea of formulations going in quest of divine response and rewards, an interpr. encouraged by the prá lexemes (like prá … etu in the next pāda, 2a).
