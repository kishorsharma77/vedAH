Various referents have been suggested for the seven reins. I tentatively take them as the seven seers (note the phonological echo between raśmáyah and ṛ́ṣayaḥ), which would allow a connection to be established both with the poetic tradition and, if the seven seers are already equated with the stars in the Big Dipper (in the Great Bear) as they are later, with that astronomical structure. That the next verse also presents what appears to be an astronomical image supports this interpr. Moreover the phrase tátrā me nā́bhir ā́tatā “to there my umbilical cord is stretched” recalls the idiom “tie navel to navel” (sám / ā́√dā), which asserts a family connection between the earthly poet and divine or semi-divine figures and elements in heaven. See comm. ad I.139.1.

The verb ‘rasps’ (rebhati) may convey the sound of old man's voice, as would be appropriate for an ancestor.
