The question in this vs. is who is the 2nd sg. referent of mányase (a), te (c), and vardha (d). Acdg. to Sāy. it is still Agni, but Ge suggests alternatively that it could be the self-address of the poet, a view shared by Re. (WG think Agni, but with a very peculiar tr. of pāda a). I think poetic self-address is excluded because of the me in b: the poet is unlikely to refer to himself as “you (sg.)” and “me” in successive pādas (and then back to “you”), so Agni is the more likely. The point must be that both Agni and the poet want the same thing -- for the Maruts to come to the sacrifice.

The identification of you as Agni requires that he possess/produce hávana- ‘calls’ in c. This can refer to the crackling of the fire. Alternatively, flg. Gr, hávana- could belong to √hu and mean ‘oblations’, but pace Gr none of the occurrences he adduces need to have that meaning.
