The slightly slangy tone of the previous verse is continued here, in the repeated verb duráḥ ‘break out’ and the cpd. ákāmakarśana- ‘not shorting desires’, as well, perhaps, as śikṣānará- (for which see AiG II.1.316-17, which classifies it with cmpds of the type trasá-dasyu- with verbal 1st member governing the 2nd).

There is surely more to be said about śikṣānará-; among other things, its accent doesn’t match the trasádasyu- type. But at least for now I will avoid the very contentious topic of such cmpds. śikṣānará- is also found in IV.20.8.
