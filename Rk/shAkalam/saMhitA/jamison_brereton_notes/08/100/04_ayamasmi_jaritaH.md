Indra clearly announces his epiphany, after the doubts expressed in vs. 3.

The opening ayám asmi echoes the opening words of the hymn (1a) ayáṃ ta emi.

víśvā jātā́ny abhy àsmi is reminiscent of vs. 5 in the preceding hymn, VIII.99.5b abhí víśvā asi spṛ́dhaḥ, and belongs to the formula abhí √bhū/as found in this group of hymns. See disc. add VIII.99.5.

On ṛtásya … pradíśaḥ see Lü (Varuṇa, 566-67), who considers them to be Lieder.

The duplication of intensive forms in nominal ādardiráḥ … dardarīmi is taken by Ge (also Lü, 566-67) as merely an etymological figure (esp. clear in Lü’s “zerschmetternd zerschmettere ich…”). This is of course possible, but I wonder if the preverb of the nominal form does not signal more. The lexeme ā́√dṛ is often used for breaking open cowpens and tearing out the cattle, esp. in the Vala myth (cf., e.g., III.30.21), and so Indra may be not only announcing his current actions but also alluding to his regular mythological role as opener of the Vala cave full of cows.
