Agni  
Prayoga Bhārgava or Agni Pāvaka Bārhaspatya or Agni Grhapati Sahasa ̥ ḥ Sūnu and  Agni Yaviṣṭha Sahasaḥ Sūnu (together or one or the other)  
22 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
For most of its length, this hymn is a conventional treatment of Agni’s ritual  activities, but with particular stress on his role as kaví “poet” or “sage poet”  (vss. 1, 5, 17, 18). In general there is little internal unity in the tr̥cas, and indeed  the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) is particularly disjointed, making a false start with two  unconnected sentence fragments (vs. 7), followed by a purpose clause with no  main clause (vs. 8). However, the second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) has a refrain, and a curi  
ous one at that:  “Agni, whose garment is the sea.” This description probably  references several different Agni themes: his identification and ultimate merging  with Apām Napāt “Child of the Waters” (see esp. II.35); the myth about Agni’s  flight from his ritual duties, in which he hides in the waters; and the sprinkling  of the fire with consecrated water in the Agnihotra, a ritual action also referred  to in verse 14, where the associated act of laying ritual grass around the fire is  also mentioned. Verse 14 may also recall Agni’s flight and his concealment in the  waters.  
The conventional hymn appears to end with the sixth tr̥ca (vss. 16–18), solemnly  treating the generation and installation of Agni as the conveyor of both the gods  and the oblations. The next tr̥ca (vss. 19–21) has a light and self-deprecating tone.  The poet claims to have neither of the barebones requisites for even a simple offer  
ing to Agni, a cow for the oblation and wood to feed his flames (vs. 19). All he has  is “something like this”—namely the hymn he has just produced. This is clearly  false modesty, and indeed the poet treats the standard wood and ghee rather slight ingly in the next two verses (20–21). In the final appended verse (22, not part of a  tr̥ca), he proudly pronounces that a man should kindle Agni with his mind and his  vision (not, the implication is, with mere wood and ghee), and indeed that he has  just done so.1214 VIII.102
