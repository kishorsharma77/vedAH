Ge interpr. mā́na- as “Tonweise” and then imposes a musical-mode interpr.

on the whole 1st hemistich, an interpr. that infects Re as well. With Old I find this “zweifelhaft.” In the publ. tr. it is rendered ‘edifice’; for mā́na- as some sort of building see VII.88.5, where JPB tr. ‘mansion’. Because of the structural parallelism with 5a (see comm. above), I would prefer that this abl. phrase refer to a place. The “ancient edifice” can be both soma’s seat in heaven and the place, or seat, on the ritual ground where soma mixes with the milk and the priest-poets sing their hymns.

For a similar phrase see I.107.5 pratnáṃ sadhástham ā́sadat “he [=Soma] has taken his ancient seat.” As for ślóka-yantra-, in my view it simply expresses the fact that sound - both the sound of the soma streams and the sound of the hymns of the priest-poets - guides and accompanies the soma along the journey of its preparation.

I am less certain about what to do with rabhasásya mántavaḥ, in part because the exact nuance of the fairly rare word mántu- is not clear. (Old’s disc. here seems off the point.) Although in cmpds (sumántu-, etc.) it seems to have the quasiinfinitival sense ‘… to think about / contemplate’ (see AiG II.2.663), as a freestanding noun it generally is glossed as ‘counsel, counselor’ corresponding to Old Avestan maṇtu- (e.g., Gr, AiG II.2.663). This works reasonably well for mántavaḥ in X.63.8 (All Gods), but the other two passages containing mántu- (I.152.1, X.32.4) are too obscure to shed any light - though ‘counsel, counselor’ is not entirely excluded. The poss. deriv. mantumant (3x, always voc., never accented) is compatible with a sense ‘possessing (wise) counsel’ in all three passages (esp.

VI.56.4), though the case is not overwhelming, given the semantic independence of vocatives. Since rabhasá- is elsewhere used of the pressed soma drinks (I.82.6 sutā́so rabhasā́ḥ), I take sg. rabhasásya as referring to soma here as well, but this leads to a possible contradition: if the soma streams are one of the subjects of ā́… samásvaran, then how can they be counselors of themself, -ves? The phrase would work better if it applied only to the priest-poets who form the other part of the subject of the verb.

Since ślókayantra- also works better if it applies only to one part of the subject, namely the soma streams, I now think that pāda b involves a non-overtly conjoined NP: “those with a signalling call for their reins [=soma streams] (and) the counselors [=priest=poets] of the wild one [=Soma].” I would therefore emend the tr. to what was just suggested. This is the closest we have come to specifying who the subj. of the repeated verb is, though both NPs are so opaque that nothing much is given away.
