Praise of the King
Abhīvarta Āṅgirasa
5 verses: anuṣṭubh
A companion piece to the preceding consecration hymn, but one that focuses only  on the combative and confrontational aspects of kingship. Here the signature idiom  is abhí-√vr̥t “roll over,” again providing the Anukramaṇī’s poet’s name. The king’s  ability to “roll over” and crush his opponents as Indra did, leaving him the only one  standing, is celebrated and ritually effected with an oblation named with the idiom  and associated with Indra (vss. 1, 4).
## 1
The Over-rolling oblation with which Indra rolled over (his enemies), with that, o Brahmaṇaspati, make us roll to kingship.
## 2
Having rolled over the rivals, over those who are hostile to us,
stand over the one who gives battle, over the one who is envious of us. 3. God Savitar has made you—Soma has made you roll over—
made you roll over all creatures, so that you will be an Over-roller.
## 4
The oblation through which Indra, when he performed it, became the  highest brilliant one,
that (oblation) I have now performed, o gods: I have therefore become  without rivals.
## 5
Without rivals, rival-smiting, (rolling) to kingship, widely victorious— so that I will rule widely over these creatures and over the people.
