Pādas abc consist entirely of four locative expressions (with their genitives); this heavily signposted syntactic pattern allows (/forces) the first word of d, áhan(n) to be interpreted as the loc. sg. of áhar ‘day’ rather than the 2nd/3rd sg. root impf. of √han, which otherwise would be strongly favored in an Indra context. (Note that the identical opening, áhann índro, is found at IV.28.3, with the verb.) The locatives in 1d, f also reinforce the loc. reading, esp. asmín áhani (1d). I don’t know exactly what to call this poetic trick -- it is aggressively a non-pun.

āprá- in a is a hapax, and there is no consensus on its meaning or derivation; see EWA s.v. I am inclined to follow Ge (etc.)’s connection with āprī́- (a noun that doesn't occur in the RV, though the verbal syntagm does) with a meaning ‘propitiator’ vel sim. This fits its dependence on vákmani ‘at the speech’ and may also thematically echo ádhi vocā ‘advocate, speak on behalf of’ in 1e. It could indeed refer to the reciter of Āprī hymns. The other leading etymological candidate is ā́√pṛ ‘fill’ (so WG; see Old), but “the filler” seems to have less connection with speaking than “the propitiator.” The way the reflexive adj. svásmin works in bc is a little tricky: “of X, at his very own anointing.” On the basis of I.134.2 I follow Ge in taking krāṇásya as passive and referring to the soma. Thus in bc we find the anointing (áñjasi) of the two primary ritual substances, fire (b) and soma (c). Alternatively, if it seems desirable to keep the referent the same in the two pādas, one can follow Re, WG in taking krāṇá- as “active,” referring to Agni.

The use of ‘head’ (śíras-/śīrṣán-) to refer to an individual person is not, as far as I know, otherwise found in the RV, though the semantic dev. is obvious and precedented in English.
