Hymn-introductory hí is difficult to render. It does not have its normal causal sense, though perhaps in this position hí is meant to explain why the hymn is recited following a particular ritual action. It is noteworthy that the first hymn of Maṇḍala VI (also, of course, to Agni) opens in exactly the same way: tváṃ hí agne.

With Ge (/WG) I take pādas def as the direct address of the gods to mortals, with the speech introduced by íti krátvā in c. (This idea goes back to Bergaigne; see Old SBE ad loc.) Rejecting this interpr., Old labors mightily to explain away the apparent 2nd pl. actives yajata and janata as voc. and 3rd pl. middle respectively. (In this he follows Sāy.) Re tries in addition to make yajata also a 3rd pl. mid. (see also Gonda [Vedic Literature, 228], whose tr. renders both forms as 3rd plurals). Although yajata could actually be a voc., 3rd pl. middles in -ata to thematic stems are morphologically impossible, no matter how metrically unfavorable -anta would be.

Ge’s direct speech interpr. solves these grammatical problems and also makes sense of the íti in c.

The poet plays with ā/a and the oppositional pair mártya- / devá- in de, with chiastic #ámartyam … mártyeṣv ā́# in d, and devám ā́devam opening e. (See also devā́so devám opening 1b.)
