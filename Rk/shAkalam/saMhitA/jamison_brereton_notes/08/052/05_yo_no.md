On īśānakṛ́t see I.61.11. Here the point is that Indra does what masters are supposed to do: give. In c áyāman is universally taken (as far as I know) as ‘not on a journey’, but it makes much more sense as a derivative of √yā ‘beg’, indicating that even without prompting Indra should do the right thing by us.
