Indra and Agni  
Śyāvāśva Ātreya  
10 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
This simple hymn is defined by its structure. Each of the three tr̥cas has a differ ent refrain, though each of the refrains begins with the vocative dual dvandva  índrāgnī “o Indra and Agni.” The final verse (10) breaks the pattern, though the  same dvandva is found, pāda-initial, in the genitive. In content the hymn is entirely  devoted to the soma sacrifice and the poet’s invitation to the two gods to come and  enjoy it. The poet names himself in verse 9 and summarizes his poetic activity in the  past tense. Such a summary is ordinarily found in the absolute final verse of hymns,  but here it is capped by the pattern-breaking verse 10.  
As often in hymns dedicated jointly to these two gods, who share little in terms  of activities and attributes, they are either described in general terms or with epi thets related to one or the other—for example, in verse 1 it is technically only Agni  who is a “regular offerer of sacrifice” (r̥tvíj), while Indra is more appropriately the  victor in prize contests (vā́jeṣu) than Agni. The third term in that verse, kármasu “in acts/deeds,” is ambiguous, however, since kárman is regularly used both of the  types of heroic deeds associated with Indra and with ritual acts more commonly  ascribed to Agni.
