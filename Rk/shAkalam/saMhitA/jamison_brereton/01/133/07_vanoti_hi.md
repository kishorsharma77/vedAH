For the one who presses soma wins the dwelling place of profusion; for  by pressing, he dashes hatreds down through sacrifice—(dashes) down  hatreds toward the gods.  
Just by pressing, he desires to win thousands, as an unobstructable  
competitor.  
To the presser Indra gives what is ready to hand—he gives the wealth  that is ready to hand.
