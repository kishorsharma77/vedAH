As Thieme points out, the last pāda, “for of many desires is mortal man,” bears the mark of a popular saying, with the l-form pulu- in place of standard puru- ‘many’ in pulu-kā́maḥ. pulu- is found only once elsewhere in the RV, in pulv-agháin the Vṛṣākapi hymn (X.86.22), which also belongs to a more vernacular register.
