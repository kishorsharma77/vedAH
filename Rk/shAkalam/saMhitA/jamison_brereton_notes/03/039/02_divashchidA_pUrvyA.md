Ge (/WG), Scar (142) take diváḥ as temporal (“noch vor Tag geboren”).

This is possible and would fit with the jā́gṛviḥ ‘wakeful’ and, perhaps, with the silvery garments of c (if they refer to dawn). Nonetheless, with Re (see also Ge’s n.

2a, where he suggests that the spatial interpr. is better), I take it as spatial “from heaven.” The vs. contrasts the immediate presence of the dhī́(séyám asmé “this one right here in us”) with her origin as a product of age-old divine and ancestral inspiration (sanajā́pítryā), and diváś cid … pūrvyā́seems to me to participate in this balanced contrast.
