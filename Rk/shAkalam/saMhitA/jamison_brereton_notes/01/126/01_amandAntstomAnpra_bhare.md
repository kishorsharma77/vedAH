Negated ámanda- ‘not feeble’ contains the adj. manda- ‘stupid, lazy’, which is otherwise not attested until the Up. and epic. The audience’s first interpr. of ámandān would be as a form of √ma(n)d ‘exhilarate’, though obviously manda- ‘stupid’ must have existed in everyday speech to allow it to be used here. As with śóka- in the last verse of the preceding hymn (I.125.7), Kakṣīvant is availing himself of words/meanings belonging to a different register to spice up the discourse. The prominent placing of ámandān as the initial word of the hymn calls further attention to this stylistic departure.
