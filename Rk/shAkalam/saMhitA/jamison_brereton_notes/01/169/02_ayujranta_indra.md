Just as the standard tr. do not notice naḥ in 1c, they are also silent on te in 2a.

I tr. “your (Maruts)”; it could also be a dat. with áyujran “they have hitched themselves up for you.” But the point is that Indra is a party to the action one way or the other.

The simplest way to construe cd is to take hā́samānā as a predicated pres. part.

(so Ge), but it is possible with Re to supply a verb (“va,” in his case) or with WG to take it as a nominal clause of possession (“Den Marut gehört Kampfaktion …”).
