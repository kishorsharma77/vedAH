Although juhuranta and related forms are assigned to the root √hṝ ‘be angry’ by Insler (1968: 219ff.), an assignment accepted by Mayrhofer (EWA s.v. HARI ) and further developed by Kü (602-3), such a meaning simply doesn’t make sense in this passage or in III.55.2, and so I take the form to √hvṛ ‘go crookedly, go amiss’. The phonology is perfectly apt, with a zero-grade having vocalic u and consonantal r before vowel, despite the metathesized zero-grade hru found in some forms.
