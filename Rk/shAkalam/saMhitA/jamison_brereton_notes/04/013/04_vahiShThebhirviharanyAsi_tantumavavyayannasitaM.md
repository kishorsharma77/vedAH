This vs. contains images drawn from the techniques of everyday life: tanning (cd) and sewing (ab). The lexeme ví √hṛ in pāda a with its object tántu- ‘thread, web’ has been differently interpreted, nor surprisingly since we don’t have good evidence for such technical vocabularies. I interpr. it as ‘take apart, unravel’, in part because of vipṛ́ce ‘pull apart’ in the previous vs. (Sim. Thieme, Unters., 17.) Others, using different values for ví, interpr. the idiom as ‘spread out’ (Old, SBE) or ‘alternate (threads [=the dark threads of night and the bright ones of day])’ (Ge, WG).
