As is generally acknowledged, the feminine plurals in the first hemistich refer to plants; the idea is the common paradox that fire is covertly present in all plants because overt fire is produced from wood. Here the three types of plants must be 1) ‘older’ (pū́rvā-) = woody and easily burned, 2) ‘later’ (áparā-) = still green and obviously growing and fire grows up with them, 3) tender (táruṇī-) = sprouting ones, which are hard to burn, but he's in them already anyway. Most tr. take sadyáḥ with Agni, not the new-born plants -- e.g., Re “est d'un coup au dedans des (plantes) nouvelle(-ment) nées” -- but sadyáḥ is strongly associated with forms of √jan, esp. in III (e.g., III.5.8 sadyó jātáḥ; sim. III.32.9, 10; 48.1), in the sense of “just born.” The covert presence of fire is the topic of the paradox in c: he is always within the plants (antárvatīḥ) even though they have not been impregnated (ápravītāḥ) sexually.
