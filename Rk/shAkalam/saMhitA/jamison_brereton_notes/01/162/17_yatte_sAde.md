The first hemistich is one of the few places in the RV that depicts horses being ridden (see also I.155.1, 163.2 -- though for an alternative for the latter see comm. ad loc. -- 163.9): both sādé lit. ‘in the seat’, here tr. ‘in riding’, and the mention of goading with a heel require a rider physically on a horse.

I follow the general interpr. of śū́kṛta- as containing a syllable śū́used to urge on horses, hence my “come on, come on.” Although Google tells me that “chirrup” and “tchick” are so used (in English, or whatever we might call it), I judged that such a tr. would simply sow confusion.

The three disfavored ways of goading a horse -- heel, whip, and excessive śū́- making -- are not parallel, or rather heel and whip go together and śū́is something else, and they are therefore summed up with useful vagueness by sárvā tā́“all these” in d. The vagueness is also useful because none of the three is a particular suitable object for sūdayāmi ‘I make sweet’, even in its most attenuated sense (Ge “… mache ich … wieder gut”).

The neut. pl. tā́in the simile in c is more mysterious. hávis- ‘oblation’ is a standard obj. of sūdáya-, but it is coopted here by the gen. háviṣaḥ. I have nonetheless supplied ‘oblations’ as the referent of tā́. Ge supplies “die Fehler” on grounds of contextual sense only. He also cites Mah. as explaining tā́as “nur Füllwort” -- an explanation I’d like to be able to use more often!
