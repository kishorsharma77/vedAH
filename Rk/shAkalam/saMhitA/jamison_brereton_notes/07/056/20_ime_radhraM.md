Ge and Re both take b as a self-contained clause. I think it better (with MMüller in SBE) to take bhṛ́miṃ cid beginning b as obj. to junanti in pāda a, parallel to radhráṃ cid -- beginning a new clause with yáthā in the middle of b. The point would be that the Maruts are so vigorous that they can energize both an entity that has no energy at all (“the feeble”) and one that has energy in excess (a whirlwind).
