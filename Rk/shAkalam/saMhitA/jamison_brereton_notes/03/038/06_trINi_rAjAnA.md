The first half of vs. 6 simply expands on vs. 5. The same two kings have as their sphere of activity an increasing number (“three, many, all” trī́ṇi … purū́ṇi … víśvāni) of “seats,” that is (in my opinion), separated places, in the cosmic division (vidáthe) also repeated from vs. 5. Note that the same verb pári √bhūṣ ‘tend to’ returns from 4a, where ‘all’ was the subject, not the object as here. In the 2nd hemistich the poet, who has been absent since vs. 2, returns, with his mind (mánasā), and sees the whole of creation in detail (or so I surmise), down to the wind-haired Gandharvas -- all subject to the commandment of the two kings.
