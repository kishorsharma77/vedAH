Pāda c is universally taken as a reference to Agni’s flight, his hiding himself in the waters, and the gods’ discovery and recovery of him there. I find this unlikely, but I do not have a better idea.

nṛ́̄n at the end of d is problematic. Ge takes it as a truncated gen. pl., hence “the sun of men,” but I would prefer to avoid such grammatical inventions. Sāy takes it as a dat. (nṝn nṛbhyaḥ), and Old (SBE and ZDMG 55: 286-88 [=KlSch 745-47]), with a delicate adjustment of that interpr., states that ṇṝ́n can “stand for” different cases, in this instance the dative, though it is an acc. pl. in form. This interpr. makes it functionally parallel to ebhyaḥ, hence Old’s (SBE) “He the Sun became visible to them, to the men.” I would prefer to keep it functionally the acc. pl. it appears to be formally, and I therefore construe it as a goal with sū́ryaḥ “the sun towards men.” The syntax of this interpr. is pretty dubious, however.
