The pavasva in this vs. is construed with an acc. phrase, vṛṣṭíṃ diváḥ. Ge treats it as if it were a straight transitive: “Läutere ... den Regen ... herab,” while Re supplies a participle to govern the acc.: “clarifie toi (nous donnant) la pluie.” It is possible that something like Re’s solution is correct: that we should supply the preverb ā́to form the lexeme ā́√pū ‘attract through purification’ (see comm. ad IX.7.8); on occasion (see, e.g., IX.13.4 and comm. ad loc.), ā́is missing, but the passage seems to require it. However, here I suggest that something different is going on: it is not that we want Soma to bring rain through his purification, but to become, turn into rain. See IX.97.44, 108.10
