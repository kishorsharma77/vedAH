Agni
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
16 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 1, 4, 10, 12; jagatī 6, 11, 14–15
This hymn was composed to accompany the creation of a new fire for the sacrifice.  This fire was created through friction using a fire drill that consisted of two pieces of  wood. The upper fire-churning stick was held vertically, with one end in a recessed  area in the lower piece of wood, which was horizontal. Wood chips were placed  around the recessed area on the lower plank. The upper stick was then rotated back  and forth, like a churn. In the later ritual this is done by wrapping a rope around the  upper stick and pulling on one side and then the other to make the stick rotate back  and forth. Eventually, enough heat was generated so that the wood chips caught fire.
This process of churning out the fire was regularly identified in the R̥gvedic  hymns with sexual intercourse, and this repeated image presents the upper  fire-churning stick as the father, with phallic overtones especially in verse 1, and the  lower fire-churning stick as the mother of fire. Another theme that runs throughout  the hymn, and again a common one in Agni hymns, is the idea that Agni is born as  a priest of the sacrifice, who carries the oblations (vss. 4, 7) and offers the sacrifice  (vs. 8) and who is a sage poet (vss. 5, 12) and a Hotar (vss. 8, 16) in the company of  the seven Hotars (vs. 14), the seven priests of the rite. The priests kindling Agni are  named in verse 15: they are the Kuśikas, whose knowledge and ability to formulate  the truth about Agni the hymn accentuates.
