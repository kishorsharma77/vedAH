Soma Pavamāna
Rahūgaṇa Āṅgirasa
6 verses: gāyatrī
Like the previous hymn, attributed to the same poet, this hymn is unified by the  repetition of a pronominal phrase at the beginning of every verse (eṣá syá “this  very one,” except for vs. 2, which has only the first pronoun). It, too, concerns  Soma’s journey through the filter (especially the first and last verses, 1 and 6) and  his manipulation by the officiant’s fingers (vss. 2, 3). The hymn is enlivened by meta
phors and similes, particularly those of verse 4.
## 1
This very one, a bull, a chariot, rushes through the sheep’s fleece,
going to the thousandfold prize.
## 2
This tawny one do the maidens of Trita [=fingers] impel with the stones, the drop for Indra to drink.
## 3
This very one do the ten tawny ones keep grooming, hard at work, those by whom he is beautified for exhilaration.
## 4
This very one settles among the human clans like a falcon (on a nest), going like a swain to a maiden.
## 5
This very one, the exhilarating juice, looks down, the child of heaven, the drop who entered the fleece.
## 6
This very one, the tawny one pressed for drinking, rushes steadily, neighing toward his own dear womb.
1268 IX. 39–40
