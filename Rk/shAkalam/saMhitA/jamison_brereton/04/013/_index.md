Agni (or Assorted Divinities)
Vāmadeva Gautama
5 verses: triṣṭubh
The Anukramaṇī assigns this hymn either to Agni or to unspecified divinities, but  as has long been recognized, it is really a hymn appropriate to dawn, mentioning  the gods associated with this time of day: Dawn herself, the Aśvins, Savitar, and  especially the Sun, who is found in all five verses. It forms a pair with the following  hymn, IV.14, also devoted to Dawn though not so identified. For further on the  similarities of these two hymns, see the introduction to IV.14.
The last three verses are especially striking, with several vivid images of the tri umph of light over darkness in verses 3–4, and in the final verse (5) a speculative  question about the sun—why does it not fall out of the sky?
