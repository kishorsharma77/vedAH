The peculiarly formed stem vāghát- clearly refers to a ritual officient of some sort, but in the absence of both a set of diagnostic contexts and a convincing etymology, it is hard to narrow his function down. Because his voice (vā́ṇi-) figures in a simile (I.88.6 vāgháto ná vā́ṇiḥ); because he is associated with verbal products, like the bráhmāṇi here; because Vāghats are the agents at vying sacrificial invocations (e.g., I.36.13 vāghádbhir vihváyāmahe; cf. III.8.10, VIII.5.16); and because they are associated with the Aṅgirases, the singers in the Vala myth (X.62.7), we chose to render the term by ‘cantor’, though this is only a guess - esp. since in most of the occurrences the ritual role and priestly activity are pretty generic. The word is also twice applied to the Ṛbhus (I.110.4, III.60.4).
