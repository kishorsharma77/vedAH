sárgeṇa … taktáḥ is a decomposed variant of sárga-takta- (III.33.4, 11)(or, vice versa, the cmpd is compounded from this phrase).

Ge terms this a “dunkler Sagenzug,” but I’m not sure why it can’t just be a snippet of the Vṛtra myth, after the serpent has been killed and Indra has released the pent-up waters, as I say in the publ. intro. Although vss. 2-3 concern the Vala myth, Vala and Vṛtra themes often appear in the same hymns. Ge also considers it difficult to supply the missing verb in b, but given sárgeṇa in a and the passively used aor.

part. sṛjānā́ḥ in c, implicitly modifying the waters, the missing verb is most likely a transitive form of √sṛj, with acc. apáḥ as obj., rather than Ge’s “hat … (geleitet).” Among the many such passages, see very nearby VI.30.4 ávāsṛjo apó áchā samudrám, also with Indra as subj. Sim. Sāy.’s visṛjati.

The root-noun cmpd. turā-ṣā́ṭ picks up turā́ya in 1b in a nod towards ring composition. I tr. ‘overcoming the precipitous’ rather than my ‘overcoming the powerful’ in the other three passages (III.48.4, V.40.4, X.55.8) in order to capture this echo.
