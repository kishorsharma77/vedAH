The two suffix-accented -tár- agent nouns in the first hemistich take accusative objects, rather than the expected gen. (nicetā́raḥ … gṛṇántam, praṇetā́raḥ … mánma). See Tichy (363-64). Although Tichy suggests some possible reasons for this unexpected (but not vanishingly rare) construction (pp. 367ff.), they don’t seem to be particularly applicable here.

I see no easy way to get a causal sense from hí, hence my “surely.” Object-less vītáye is clarified by 6b vyantu … hávīṃṣi.

The pf. part. pipriyāṇā́ḥ is interpr. by Ge/Re as implicitly prospective: the Maruts will become pleased/gratified as a result of their vītí-. I take it rather as having preterital value: they have first been gratified by the initial guest-reception ritual and are now awaiting their meal. A passage like I.73.1 átithir ná prīṇānáh “being gratified like a guest” supports this interpr.
