## 1
Comrades, sing to him while he is being purified for your exhilaration. Like a child they sweeten him with sacrifices, with greetings.
## 2
Like a calf, being impelled to join with his mothers, he is driven [/anointed], pursuing the gods, the exhilarating drink adorned all around with
thoughts.

## 3
Here is the one bringing success to skill; here is the one to pursue
the troop.
Here is the pressed drink, most honeyed for the gods.
## 4
When pressed, o well-skilled drop, run for us (with goods) in cows and  horses.
I have fixed your gleaming color among the cows.
## 5
O drop, lord of the fallow bays, as the one who best affords delight to  the gods,
like a manly comrade for a comrade, be there for our illumination.
## 6

double-dealing one.
