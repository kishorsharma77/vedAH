Indra and Varuṇa The patterning of the names of the two gods is mildly interesting. It is fairly strict for the first half of the hymn but varies considerably in the 2nd. The first 5 vss.

have a discontinuous dual dvandva opening the first pāda, either as voc. índrā … varuṇā (1a, 4a, 5a) or nom./acc. índrā … váruṇā (nom. 3a, acc. 4a). The next vss.

break the pattern, but the variation starts slowly: vs. 6 (the central vs. of the hymn) does contain the pāda-initial nom. dual dvandva but postponed until the 2nd hemistich (6c). But then vs. 7 omits the names altogether. The names reappear in vs. 8, but in the final pāda and not as a dual dvandva but as a pāda-initial discontinuous individual sg. acc. phrase: 8d índram … váruṇam. The same individual acc. phrase (now continuous but not pāda initial) is found in 9a. Vs. 10 again omits the names. The final vs. returns to a discontinuous pāda-initial voc. phrase, but only in the b pāda and with singulars not dual: índra … varuṇa. Thus the 2nd half of the hymn appears to treat the gods separately rather than as a unit, but I see no reflection of this separation in the content of the hymn: the two do not display their individual characteristics more in the 2nd half.
