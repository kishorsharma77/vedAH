You, Agni, (giving wealth) rich in heroes to the one who does honor, are  Tvaṣṭar—yours is kinship, o you accompanied by the Wives (of the  Gods) and possessing Mitra’s might—  
You have given (wealth) rich in horses as the impeller of swift (horses)  [=Child of the Waters]. You of many goods are the troop of men  
[=Maruts].
