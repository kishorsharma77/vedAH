The 1st sg. pf. dīdhayā is taken by all as a straight indicative; the Pp. reads dīdhaya with short final vowel. My tr. “I ponder” reflects this analysis (Kü [257-60] having demonstrated that the indic. pf. of this root is always presential). However, I now wonder if this form could be a subjunctive with the unextended 1st sg. subj.

ending -ā. Although lengthened forms of the indic. pf. ending -a do exist (e.g., védā 9x), they are relatively uncommon. And a subjunctive “I shall ponder …” would open this speculative hymn nicely.

The standard tr. take priyā́ṇi … párāṇi as coreferential (e.g., Old “die fernsten, lieben (Dinge, Ereignisse)”). I prefer to take the two as contrastive, the nearby familiar things dear to the poet and far-away matters almost beyond his ken -- with the intensive (i.e., frequentative) part. mármṛśat conveying the restless activity of his mind. Realizing that he needs the steadying hand of poetic tradition to help control his racing but fertile thoughts, in d he expresses his desire for poets belonging to that tradition to give a full account of what he is seeing -- though he does not deny that he himself has wisdom.
