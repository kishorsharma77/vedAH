The interpr. of varasyā́- as somehow a deriv. of vára- ‘wish’, found, e.g., in Gr, Ge, and AiG II.2.244, is contextually understandable: Ge’s “Kommet … zum Bittgesuch des Sängers” makes more immediate sense than my “come hither in response to the singer's longing for space,” with “in response to” smuggled in to make the sentence somewhat more parsable. But there is no váras- to √vṝ ‘wish, choose’, whereas váras- means ‘wide space’, something that RVic poets often express a desire for. Re hesitates (his word), but opts for ‘desire for space’ and adduces the quite apposite I.181.9 varivasyā́gṛṇānáḥ “singing (to you) with a desire for space,” comparable to our gṛṇató varasyā́.

The causal relationship between c and ab, suggested by hí (c), is not straightforward. But in its only other occurrence (IV.51.3), acitrá- refers to a place, one without brightness, therefore by implication sterile and lifeless. Thus the desire for (positive) space expressed in b is contrasted with (negative) space that the Maruts can, nonetheless, bring to life.

I don’t understand the point of d.
