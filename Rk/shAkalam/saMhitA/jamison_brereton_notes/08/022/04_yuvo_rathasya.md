For īrmā́‘at rest, standing still’, contra Gr ‘rasch’, etc., Ge ‘zurück’, see Narten IIJ 10 (1967-68) and EWA s.v. iṣaṇyá- is ordinarily transitive, so I take vām as its obj. (so also Gr), contra Ge and Re. This must be a paradox: the motionless chariot wheel is the one that propels them, not the speedy one in pāda a. I do not have a vision of how this would work in practice, though.
