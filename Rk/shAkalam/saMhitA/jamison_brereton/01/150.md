Agni
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
3 verses: uṣṇih
A curious pendant to Dīrghatamas’s Agni cycle, with many puzzles despite its  brevity. The poet seems to begin by declaring his allegiance and service to Agni  and making his claim for guest-friendship (hence the “stranger” in vs. 1) and pro tection on that basis. In verse 2 he rejects the patronage of a non-sacrificer, despite  his riches, while in verse 3 he returns to the benefits that accrue to the devotee  of Agni.
## 1
Performing much ritual service for you, I call myself a stranger (under  the protection) of you, o Agni,
as if under the protection of the great goad [=sun].
## 2
(I go) away (from the protection) of the rich man who lacks force, who  gives nothing even when oblations are made,
who, not seeking the gods, is never forthcoming. 3. O inspired one, (I) a mortal (call myself) the luminous one, great, the  proudest in heaven.
Zealous for you, o Agni, might we become more and more preeminent.
