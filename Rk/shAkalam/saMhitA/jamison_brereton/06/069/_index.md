Indra and Viṣṇu  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
8 verses: triṣṭubh  
The focus of most of this hymn is entirely ritual, with the two divine recipients of  the hymn treated as a unit. The gods are repeatedly urged to come together to the  sacrifice, to enjoy the various forms of praise, and to drink the soma—as well as  to give us wealth in return. Only one verse (4) is devoted to the gods’ deeds, with  the “wide striding” that is Viṣṇu’s best-known exploit attributed to both of them.  Their unity is reinforced by the grammar. Every verse in this hymn contains a voca  
tive address to the two gods, always in a dvandva compound, except for the final  verse (8).  
In that verse, the two gods are grammatically separated though still addressed  in the vocative, and this grammatical change marks a sharp change in conception  as well. Though it is emphasized in the first half of the verse that both have con quered and not been conquered, in the second half it is said that they contended  with each other, but in the end divided the stake of a thousand (cows?) in thirds,  with each taking a part. As Geldner points out, this dispute between Indra and  Viṣṇu is referred to a number of times in early Vedic prose and later, and according  to the Taittirīya Saṃhitā (VII.1.5.5) Indra received two thirds of the stake, Viṣṇu  one third. The hymn thus springs a surprise at its end, by this glancing allusion to strife between the two gods who were depicted throughout the rest of the hymn as  an indissoluble pair.  
The language and style of most of the hymn are unremarkable and somewhat  repetitive. Noteworthy are verses 2 and 3, with parallel structures in their second  halves, deploying parallel puns on day (the sun’s rays) and night, homonymous with  words referring to verbal productions at the sacrifice.
