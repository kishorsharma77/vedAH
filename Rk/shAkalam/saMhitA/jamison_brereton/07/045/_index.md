Savitar  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
4 verses: triṣṭubh  
This simple hymn concentrates on Savitar as giver of goods and human necessities,  though several of his other characteristic acts are mentioned, notably the raising  of his golden arms (vs. 2) and the daily bringing to rest and impelling forth of the  living world (vs. 1).
