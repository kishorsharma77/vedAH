As Ge points out, pāda a is very similar to IV.48.3 ánu kr̥ṣṇé vásudhitī, yemā́te viśvápeśasā “The two black treasure chambers [=Night and Dawn], with all their ornaments, have directed themselves after each other in turn.” Bloomfield (RR ad III.31.17) cleverly comments, “The words kr̥ṣṇé and vásudhitī are both dvandva ekaçeṣa 'black (Night) and (Uṣas)' is a way of saying náktoṣā́sā; conversely 'treasuregiving (Morn) and black (Night)' is uṣā́sānáktā.” “The magnanimity of the sun” is a slightly surprising expression. Is it that the sun makes the succession of Night and Dawn possible by his transit across the sky, and this is considered generous on his part? Or is it an indirect reference to the distribution of the dakṣiṇā at dawn. A related, but opposite, sentiment is found in VII.81.4 uchántī yā́krṇ̥ óṣi maṃhánā mahi, prakhyaí devi svàr dr̥śé “You who in dawning make through your magnanimity the sun to be visible for seeing,” with the magnanimity credited to Dawn.

The only other occurrence of pl. ṛjipyá- (II.34.4) is at least indirectly used of the Maruts; the standard tr. all assume they are the referents of cd, which seems correct. Here they seem to be functioning as priests, attempting to bring Indra to a sacrifice.
