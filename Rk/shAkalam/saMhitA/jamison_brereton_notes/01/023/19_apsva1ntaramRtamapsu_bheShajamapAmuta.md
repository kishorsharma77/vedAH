Again I disagree with most tr. in the disposition of the b pāda. I take it with a, because I think we mortals are to glorify the waters. Others think the gods should become strong or victorious in order to praise the waters - but gods are not usually the agents of such praising.

I.23.20-23 = X.9.6-9, save that the fourth pāda of 20 is missing in X.9.6.
