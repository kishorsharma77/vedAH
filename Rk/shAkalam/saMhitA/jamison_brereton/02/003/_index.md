11 verses: triṣṭubh, except jagatī 7  
This is one of the ten so-called Āprī hymns in the R̥gveda, a litany recited at the  animal sacrifice: the subjects of the verses appear in a fixed order, each signaled by a  key word (italicized in the following translation), though the exact wording of each  differs from hymn to hymn. This type of flexible composition around a set of fixed  themes and terms in a fixed order may give us some insight into R̥gvedic compo  
sitional techniques. This version is somewhat fuller and verbally richer than most,  encouraged by the relatively capacious measures of triṣṭubh meter. For a minimalist  version, see I.13.
