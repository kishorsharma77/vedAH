On áprāmi-satya see Scar 388, inter alia. With him and others (see already Gr) I take the first member as derived from prá √mī, but in the common idiom ‘confound’. In my view the compound concerns a regularly expressed anxiety about Indra - does he exist? See, e.g., VIII.100.3 néndro astī́ti néma u tva āha “‘Indra does not exist,’ so says many a one.” Our compound addresses this by calling him one “whose reality cannot be confounded.” Ge’s “der sein Versprechen nie bricht” assumes a meaning ‘promise’ for satyá- that I don’t think is justified for the RV.

Scar’s “dessen Wahrheit unwandelbar ist” is closer to mine, but I don’t think his rendering of the first member is sufficiently pointed.
