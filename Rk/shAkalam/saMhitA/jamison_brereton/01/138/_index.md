Pūsaṇ
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
4 verses: atyaṣṭi
This hymn lacks the colloquial tone and idiomatic style of most Pūṣan hymns.  Instead, as befits the elaborate meter, this is high-register praise, with a somewhat  bombastic and overblown edge and contorted syntax.
The poet is especially concerned to establish “fellowship” (sakhyá, vss. 2–4) with  the god—fellowship that will bring wealth and aid along with it.
