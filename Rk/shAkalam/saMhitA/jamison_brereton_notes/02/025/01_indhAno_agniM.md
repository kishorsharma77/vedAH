In c I take the phrase jāténa jātám as expressing an essentially hostile relationship between adversaries: he extends beyond the offspring (of his competitor) with his own offspring. This interpr. would match the similar configuration of etymological figures in 2a vīrébhir vīrā́n vanavad vanuṣyatáḥ “With his heroes he will win against the heroes who seek to win,” which in turn expands the etymological figure in vanavad vanuṣyatáḥ in 1a. The standard tr. take both elements in jāténa jātám as referring to the offspring of the subject: “he will extend beyond his offspring with (more) offspring” or “offspring after offspring.” However, the strong parallel in 2a makes this less likely in my opinion.
