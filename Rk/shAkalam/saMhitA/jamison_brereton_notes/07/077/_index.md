Dawn On the structure of this hymn, as signaled by its verb forms and personal reference, see publ. intro. The first three vss. contain a series of sg. augmented aorists (started with a perfect), all but ábhūt with Dawn as 3rd ps. subj.: úpa ruruce, ábhūt, ákar, úd asthāt, áśvait, aroci (which last almost forms a ring with the opening pf.), adarśi, into which fem. sg. pres. participles have been interspersed: prasuvántī, bā́dhamānā, bíbhratī, váhantī, náyantī. Following that we get in vss. 4-5a an equally insistent series of imperatives: ucha, kr̥dhi, yāvaya, ā́bhara, codáya, ví bhāhi, with Dawn as 2nd ps. subject. In 5b the fem. pres. parts return: pratirántī, dádhatī. In the last vs. the pattern is broken again: a pl. present vardháyanti with the Vasiṣṭhas as subject, found in the only subordinate cl. in the hymn, and in the last pāda before the clan refrain an aor. injunctive in imperatival usage, dhāḥ.
