The number disharmony continues here, at least in my view. Ge. takes the sg.

rel. pron. yáḥ as referring to Indra and then supplies the verb ‘drinks’ to governing the ‘hundred’ and ‘thousand’ phrases referring to soma. But if yáḥ is instead taken as referring to soma and coreferential with the (unexpressed) subj. of the verb in the main clause rīyate, no material needs to be supplied. Instead the singular ‘which (soma)’ is defined as consisting of a hundred or a thousand separate drinks. So also Re.
