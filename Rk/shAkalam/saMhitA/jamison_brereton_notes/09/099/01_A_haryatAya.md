The stem mahīyú- is found also in IX.65.1, also with a fem. pl. subj. There it is quite clearly the fingers of the officiants, and there is no reason why it can’t refer to the fingers here as well (as indeed is the standard view). The adj. is generally rendered ‘considering themselves great’ vel sim., but in both passages ‘seeking the great’ works just as well and better fits the usual sense of -yú-stems (gavyú- ‘seeking cattle’, etc.). I don’t see why the fingers would “pleins d’orgueil” as Re has it.

As Ge points out (n. 1c), by “glowing / bright garment” (śukrā́m … nirṇíjam) the milk is meant.

“At the forefront of the inspired words” (vipā́m ágre) sets the time as the beginning of the sacrifice.
