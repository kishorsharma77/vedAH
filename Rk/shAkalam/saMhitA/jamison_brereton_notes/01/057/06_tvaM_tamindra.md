The “cut” in the first hemistich is ambiguous in English but is a past tense rendering pf. cakartitha. I added ‘apart’ despite the absence of ví because unadorned English “cut the mountain” sounds odd. The vájreṇa vajrin opening pāda b at least provides the desired v-.

Verbal play, in which two unrelated words mimic an etymological connection: párvatam (a) … parvaśáḥ (b) “mountain … joint by joint.” The two items are in the same metrical position, and each is in a pāda that begins with an alliterative pair: t u váṃ tám and vájreṇa vajrin.
