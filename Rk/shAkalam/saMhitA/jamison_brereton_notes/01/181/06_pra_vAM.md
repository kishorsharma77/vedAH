This vs. is quite parallel to vs. 5: it begins prá vām, with a verb of motion in the 2nd pāda to be construed with prá (gamyāh and carati respectively); the 3rd pādas are identical save for their first word, X anyásya pīpáyanta vā́jaiḥ. I therefore construe the vs. as I did vs. 5 with “lead horse” the subj. of ab, Indra the referent of anyásya in c, and a new clause beginning with pīpáyanta. That the subj. of d is plural gives support to my suggestion that 5d also contains a plural not a dual.

śarádvant- ‘having autumns/years’ in pāda a is a hapax, but presumably means ‘having (many) years’ -- thus ‘experienced’, of the lead horse.

As was noted ad I.178.2, I do not believe that we need a separate root √viṣ ‘sich ergiessen’ for three passages, including this one; ‘toil, labor’ works for all the passages. My ‘roil’ here, besides conveniently rhyming with ‘toil’, is meant to express the physical motion of the waters at work.
