The publ. tr. fails to render the demon. ayā́that opens the hymn; more literal would be “flow around in this pursuit (of him) …” Ge (n. 1) considers ayā́a kind of attraction from

*asya ‘of him’, the missing antecedent to yáḥ in b, but the prominent position of ayā́should
be registered. Presumably ayā́vītī́is gesturing towards the physical ritual activity happening right now.

The unnamed referent in the rel. cl. of bc is of course Indra; the “nine and ninety” are fortresses / strongholds, as in IV.26.3 … púraḥ … náva sākáṃ navatī́ḥ śámbarasya. This referent is postponed to the 2nd vs.: púraḥ opens vs. 2.
