The standard interpr. take jāmáyo gíraḥ as a nominative NP (Ge “die verschwisterten Lobreden”), modified by the intens. part. dédiśatīḥ. Although I see the advantages of this, it leaves the participle with little to do (Ge “die dich herausstreichen,” Re “indiquant avec force (leur intention),” Scar (82) “die immer wieder auf dich hinweisen”). I separate gíraḥ from jāmáyaḥ and take it as the acc. obj.

of the intens. participle. The question then is the referent of jāmáyaḥ ‘kindred, siblings’. I tentatively suggest it is the waters, who appear in the next vs. as ritual actors. The waters are called jāmí- elsewhere (I.23.16). Because waters are always gurgling, they can be considered to be the deliverers of hymns.
