See the disc. of this vs. as omphalos and riddle in the publ. intro. As indicated there, I identify the bride as Dawn and the husband as the Sun, while the dominant opinion (see Ge [/WG]) is rather Speech and Indra. The latter is certainly not excluded, and the fact that the stem iṣirá-, used to qualify the speech of the pressing stones in 2c, also characterizes the wife in 3b may give some support to that view. Cf. also IX.84.4 vā́cam iṣirā́m uṣarbúdham “the vigorous speech awakening at dawn.” Still, the Dawn/Sun interpr. follows naturally from the dawn ritual setting in the first two vss., and the long journey in d would refer to the daily trip across the sky.

As also noted in the publ. intro. śravasyād ráthaḥ “the chariot will seek fame” recalls the name of the patron in the immed. preceding hymn, V.36.6, Śrutaratha, which was also punned on in V.36.3.

With Ge I take purū́sahásrā as a measure of distance and pári vartayāte as intrans./reflex., based on its middle form. This is disputed by WG, who take the verb as transitive (but “affektive” [whatever that means], the value that accounts for its middle form). They supply ‘men’ as the referent of purū́sahásrā. The idea is that the noise of Indra’s chariot will cause many thousands of them to turn around and look at it. I suppose this is not impossible, but again it requires supplying much more than is found in the context: a huge crowd of people and the presupposition that “cause to turn” implies “turn to look.”
