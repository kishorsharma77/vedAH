As noted in the publ. intro., this vs., esp. its first hemistich, provides the solution to the implicit riddle of the hymn, by associating “the thread of truth” (ṛtásya tántuḥ) both with the filter and therefore the soma streams on their ritual journey and with the tongue tip and therefore the priest-poets’ hymns. See disc.

there. Note also that ṛtásya tántuḥ forms a slight ring with ṛtásya yónā in 1b.

The vs. is very similar to IX.83.1, a mystical hymn also treating the filter and attributed to the same poet.

pavítram te vítatam brahmaṇas pate, prabhúr gā́trāṇi páry eṣi viśvátaḥ átaptatanūr ná tá āmó aśnute, śr̥tā́so íd váhantas tát sám āśata The filter is outstretched for you, o lord of the sacred formulation. Advancing, you circle around its limbs on all sides.

A raw one, with unheated body, does not attain it [=filter]; only the cooked ones, driving along, have attained it entirely.

Note esp. pavítram … vítatam matching our vítataḥ pavítra ā́, prabhúḥ matching our áprabhuḥ, and the emphasis on attainment, ná … aśnute, … sám āśata, matching our anínakṣanta āśata. For further disc. see also the publ. intro. to IX.83.

In d padāti must be a double marked subjunctive to the root aor, which is otherwise only middle. The model for its creation is not clear to me.
