Soma
Vimada Aindra or Vimada Prājāpatya, or Vasukrt V̥ āsukra
11 verses: āstārapaṅkti
The only Soma hymn in the Xth Maṇḍala, this hymn, like the others dedicated to  Soma outside the IXth Maṇḍala, lacks reference to the ritual preparation of the  soma drink, the theme that dominates the IXth Maṇḍala. In fact, there is almost no  acknowledgement that soma is a ritual substance at all: just the phrase “the fellow
ship of the stalk” in verse 1, the identification of Soma as máda “exhilarating” in  verse 10, and the refrain beginning “in... exhilaration” (ví...máde), itself a pun on  the name of the poet Vimada (see introduction to X.21).
The Soma of this hymn is predominately a protector, benevolently forgiving  childish transgressions on our part (vs. 3), watching over our possessions and our selves (vss. 6–7), and guarding us from external threats (vss. 3, 7–10), as well as  helping us cultivate our best qualities (vss. 1, 4). This Soma also presides over the  distribution of desirable things, probably in the form of the priestly gift or dakṣiṇā.  This aspect of Soma is first hinted at in verse 2, developed in verse 5, and trium phantly proclaimed in the final verse, 11.
The hymn contains some curious turns of phrase and slanted imagery,  and so the mention of the great Ist Maṇḍala poet Kakṣīvant in verse 10 is not

altogether surprising. It is unclear whether the poet of this hymn is simply claim ing Kakṣīvant’s mantle or whether there is a family connection or even identity  with Kakṣīvant.
The least clear part of the hymn is the second part of the final verse (11), where  it is claimed that Soma will help the blind and the halt “for the seven.” Soma’s aid  to the disabled is expressed in similar terms in VIII.79.2, another Soma hymn found  outside of IX, but the identity of “the seven” in our verse is disputed, and the poet  seems to have wanted to leave it open.

Make auspicious thought, skill, and resolve our familiars.
Then in the fellowship of your stalk (o Soma, we will take pleasure), as  cows take pleasure in a pasture.

And I transgress your commandments, Soma, through naïveté.
So then, like a father to his son offer mercy to us; (guard us) against the  fatal weapon.

O drop that best smashes obstacles, you are for us Indra’s benevolent  comrade,
