As indicated in the publ. intro., this vs. carries on and develops the themes of vs. 3. In that vs. Soma moves across the two worlds, implying a horizontal axis, while here, in my view, we shift to the vertical -- with Soma’s head in heaven and his foot(print) on earth. This vs. is much discussed by Lü (228-32), who also emphasizes the cosmic, but because he always strictly separates the heavenly and the earthly soma, I think in a way he misses the point.

My image of the vertical Soma depends on taking padám in b as his ‘footprint’, but this is not the standard interpr. in this passage, where padám is generally taken simply as ‘place’ vel sim. (Ge Stätte, Re séjour), with Ge further specifying it as the cup. His identification of the padá- with the cup then leads Ge to a somewhat aberrant tr. of pinvate (‘overflow’: “… macht … seine Stätte überquellen”). But the middle voice of pinvate, contrasting with act. pinvat in the previous vs. (3b), encourages a self-beneficial (/-involved) interpr. of the verb, as does the instr. svadháyā ‘by his independent power’ -- which supports my interpr. of padám as referring to Soma’s own footprint.

And what does it mean that he “swells his own footprint”? I connect this with vājáyann apáḥ “stirring the waters” in pāda a. Here I would agree with Lü that these are the heavenly waters, and I further suggest that these waters, stirred up by the heavenly Soma and fallen from heaven as rain, are what swells his footprint and the earth on which it’s emplanted. This rain may also be indirectly alluded to in pāda c.

The grain that ornaments the soma plant is probably, on the one hand, a reference to the variety of soma drink into which grain is mixed (see IX.55.1 and comm.; also Ober II.55), but I think it also likely alludes to the fecundating power of rain and the vegatation it produces.

There are two finite verbs in d, both accented (adjacent … násate rákṣate …), with no overt mark of subordination. With most interpr. I take the násate clause as implicitly subordinated, with rákṣate beginning the main cl., but contrastive verbal accent of adjacent verbs could as easily be invoked (and would make little diff. in interpr.: “he joins … he guards …”). Lü makes much of the last clause, and in fact takes śíraḥ as subj. of rákṣate (which seems unlikely on rhetorical grounds), but I think the sense is fairly straightforward: even while soma is being pressed by the fingers at the earthly ritual, he keeps his head safe in heaven.
