Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Although in many ways this is a straightforward invitation to soma, the hymn is  also shot through with the anxiety about whether Indra will choose our sacrifice  that is characteristic of other hymns in this Indra cycle. The first two verses are  simple collections of the clichés of the journey/invitation hymn genre, but in verse 3

the poet worries about the best means of ritual service and in verse 4 reminds Indra  that earlier poets were no different from us.
