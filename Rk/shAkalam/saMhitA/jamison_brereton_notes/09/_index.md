Commentary IX.1-67 Since all hymns in this maṇḍala are dedicated to Soma Pavamāna, the dedicand will not be identified for each hymn.

In both the publ. tr. and in the comm., I have tried to use lower case soma for the substance and capped Soma for the god, but of course much of the point of the Soma Maṇḍala is that the two cannot be separated. So this convention is not fully workable.


- 1-67 -All hymns in Gāyatrī meter.
