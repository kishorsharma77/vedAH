The aṃśú- here is in the first instance the shoots of the soma plant, the usual sense of this stem, but I think a possible secondary sense is the tufts of wool on the fleece filter, which can resemble shoots of vegetation. In the former case the instr. expresses accompaniment, in the latter instr. of path-along-which. See the instr. in 1a (áṇvyā), 2b (pathā́), and 6b (páruṣā), which all refer to the fleece along which soma journeys.
