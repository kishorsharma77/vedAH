For -ín-stem superlative prapathíntama-, found also in VI.31.5, and prápatha- (4x, incl. nearby I.166.9), to which it is built, see comm. ad I.166.9.

Pāda c is problematic. The standard tr. take kṣonī́ḥ as subject, but this is grammatically problematic: kṣoní/ī́- is fem., but the subj. of c is the most likely referent of masc. yé in d. The gender disagreement disturbs both Ge and Old; the best solution they can come up with is a constructio ad sensum. I therefore take kṣoṇī́ḥ as acc. pl. The problem then is the absence of a verb -- a problem also for those who take kṣoṇī́ḥ as nom. Ge uses the infinitive paritaṃsayádhyai from b, but I am reluctant to assume that kind of enjambement. Both Re and WG seem to do without a verb, allowing pāda c to dribble off unfulfilled into the rel. cl. of d. I supply a verb like ‘direct, send’, with no confidence in its correctness. As for the subj., I take it to be the warriors referred to by samátsu … satā́m in pāda a, although Old considers this gekünstelt. If, on the other hand, kṣoṇī́ḥ is the subj., I would tr. “the battle cries [=opposing sides] (call out) to Indra …” Ge takes sūríṃ cid as a simile, with cid as the simile marker. As I’ve said elsewhere, I don’t believe that cid ever has that function, a view in which I am joined by Old, I’m happy to say. (See his remarks on this passage.) The point here is rather that the people call upon Indra as a fighter in battle, but also call him a patron when he distributes the prizes won in battle: he fills both roles.
