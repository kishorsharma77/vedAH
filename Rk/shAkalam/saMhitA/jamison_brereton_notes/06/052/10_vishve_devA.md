The first hemistich here does assay a little figure: ṛtā- ṛtú- across the pāda boundary.

The use of yújya- in c is not entirely clear to me. I take it to mean that the offering, the milk (páyaḥ), is ritually associated with the calls (hávana-) the gods are hearing. Cf. VI.3.8. Ge and Re think that the association is between the substance and the gods.
