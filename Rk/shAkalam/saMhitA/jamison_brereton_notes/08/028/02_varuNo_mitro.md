The Gift Escorts (rāti-ṣā́c-) are rather shadowy divine figures. In II.1.13 they escort (saścire) Agni at the ceremonies, a situation that may be reflected here.

Otherwise they mostly show up in All God hymns (esp. a run of them in VII) as fairly uncharacterized minor divinities. For further disc. cf. comm. ad VII.38.5. See Scar 593.

In III.6.9 Agni is urged to bring the 33 gods (see our 1a) to the sacrifice along with their wives (pátnīvant- as here), a ritual situation that can link our vss. 1-2.
