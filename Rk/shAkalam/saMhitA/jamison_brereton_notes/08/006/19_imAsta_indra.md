enā́m in c would be the only accented form of the ordinarily enclitic pronominal stem ena-. See Old’s lengthy discussion of possibilities and previous suggestions, although he does not reach a definite conclusion. My interpretation is one that Old also seems to favor, that enā́m stands for the independent adverbial instrumental enā́‘thus, in this way’ (an idea in different form that goes back to Hopkins). As he points out, in the position before ṛ this would probably come out as enā́m̐with anunāsika (Proleg. 470), and the redactional conversion of this to a “real” m, esp. in a feminine context, would not be surprising. This adverb enā́is quite often, though not invariably, pāda-initial. See esp. semantically parallel III.33.4 enā́vayám páyasā pínvamānāḥ “So we (are) -- swelling with milk …” For pipyúṣī- construed with the genitive, see vs. 43b below, mádhor ghṛtásya pipyúṣīm.
