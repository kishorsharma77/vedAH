Indra
Atri Bhauma
5 verses: anuṣṭubh, except paṅkti 5
As was already noted, this hymn is paired with V.38, sharing some vocabulary and  themes, but this one is more coherent in both syntax and thought. The first three  verses urge Indra to give in abundance, while in the last two (4–5) the poet urges his  fellow Atris to praise the god.
