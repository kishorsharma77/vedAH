Soma Pavamāna  
Avatsāra Kāśyapa  
4 verses: gāyatrī  
The first three verses of this simple hymn describe Soma’s journey in the filter (vs.  1), as the liquid separates into multiple streams in the channels of the fleece (vs. 2),  and his preparation by the fingers (vs. 3). The fourth verse then requests protection  for ourselves and our men, while urging the soma to flow for its divine recipients.
