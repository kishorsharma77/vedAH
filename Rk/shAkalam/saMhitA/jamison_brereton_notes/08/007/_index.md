Maruts As noted in the publ. intro., this hymn contains dense repetitions of vocabulary and numerous phonetic echoes within and across verses. I have noted some, but by no means all, below. Particularly common in the earlier part of the hymn is the root √yā ‘drive’, in both verbal and nominal forms (2b, 4c [2x], 5a, 7b, 8b; also 14b, 23a, 26b, 28c, 29c).
