All Gods  
Vasukarṇa Vāsukra  
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 15  
The listing impulse found in the previous hymn is here carried further. The gods  in general, groups of gods such as the Ādityas, Vasus, and Rudras, and individual  gods both major and minor are invoked here, with conventional descriptors and  predicates and with standard prayers for help and blessing. There is little to catch  the attention in this hymn, though it is certainly competently done.
