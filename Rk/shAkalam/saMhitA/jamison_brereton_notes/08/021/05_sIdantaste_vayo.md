A verse that makes less sense the more one thinks about it, since the bird simile does not seem to fit the context: birds don't normally sit either next to or in honey, nor do they normally roar. The simile must have as its third term “in a nest” or “in a tree” (cf. dru-ṣád(van) several times of birds) as the parallel to the loc. honey phrase.
