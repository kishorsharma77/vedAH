My tr. differs conceptually and syntactically from Ge’s, also, to a lesser degree, from Schmidt’s (B+I 83). Ge thinks the obj. sadṛ́śīḥ … kṛṣṇā́ḥ … jā́ḥ refers to the nights (“die … gleichen (Nächte), die schwarzen Kinder”) and that anyám árdham “the other side” is the goal to which Indra drove the nights. Acdg. to him, this is a different image of the singer’s Not -- the first narrowness, the second unbroken night. I find the supposed change of topic, from the tight place in which we found ourselves in vs. 20, unlikely; instead I consider this vs. a continuation of vs. 20, in which Indra drives away the enemy, as often described as black or dark, that implicitly hemmed us in, a view shared by Schmidt. However, the latter agrees with Ge in taking anyám árdham as a goal, “Täglich vertrieb er die gleichen schwarzen Kinder von ihrem Sitz an die andere (Welt-)Hälfte,” whereas I consider it a characterization of the enemy and so in apposition to sadṛ́śīḥ … kṛṣṇā́ḥ … jā́ḥ, the phrase into which it’s interleaved. The “other half” would be the alternately favored and disfavored sides in vss. 15-18, as well as the “side of the hostile” (dviṣatáḥ pákṣaḥ) of 19c.

HvN disassemble the sandhi across cd as vasnayánta, but this dual must have a long final; so Pp.

The part. vasnayántā is a hapax, but related to vasná- ‘price’, vásnya- ‘to be sold, up for sale’. It modifies the two enemies of Indra, Varcin and Śambara, of whom we know little beyond Indra’s enmity towards them. The denom. vasna-yá- is therefore interpretable in a number of ways. Gr takes it as ‘feilschen’ (haggle), while Ge tr. ‘Lösegeld fordern’ (demand ransom), calling the two enemies Raubritter (robber barons) in his intro. (p. 144). EWA posts both tr., though they do not seem at all equivalent to me. Schmidt returns to Gr’s feilschen. I add yet another possibility -

- ‘mercenaries’ -- on the basis of a literal rendering of normal denom. semantics
‘seek X’, hence ‘seek a price’. But given the state of our ignorance about these two foes, no interpr. is secure (though I very much doubt that the two were ‘haggling’ with Indra when he picked up his vajra). We should note that in the next vs. (22c), we accept “the goods belonging to Śambara” (śāmbaráṃ vásu), which may refer to Śambara’s vasná- in 21, though not in a way that disambiguates it.

Gr takes udávraje as a PN, Ge as a place name. My tr. follows Schmidt’s interpr. (83-84) as a bahuvrīhi ‘dessen Hürde das Wasser ist’, as a description of a mountain surrounded (or semi-surrounded) by a body of water.
