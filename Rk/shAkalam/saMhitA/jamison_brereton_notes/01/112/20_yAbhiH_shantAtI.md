The problem in these obscure fragments of tales is to decide which of the words are PNs and which are adjs. In c Ge takes the three fem. acc. as separate names, but I prefer to take omiyā́vatīm and subhárām as proleptic adjectives, since both stems are found earlier in the hymn in full lexical usage (omyā́vantam 7b, subhárā(ḥ) 2a). Sim. Scar (p. 639), Remmer (Frauennamen, p. 85).
