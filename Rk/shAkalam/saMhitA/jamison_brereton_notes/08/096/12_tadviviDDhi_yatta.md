title = "12"

I use two different English tr. for namanti, ‘bend’ and ‘bow’, depending on the object; this is merely an English problem, as the passage adduced by Ge shows: VII.23.20 ā́... índram ... name girā́, nemíṃ táṣṭeva.

In cd I supply ‘cry out’ (√svar) on the basis of 11a sám … asvaran (note the sám in 12d) and 12b (abhi)svárā.

Ge takes tarasvínaḥ as nom. pl., which is grammatically possible, but I prefer Old’s gen. sg. (an alternative also for Gr), since the same adj. modifies Indra in 10d.
