Here, despite the obj. phrase in b, pávasva lacks the expected ā́. It would technically be possible to take b with c: “establishing luster and an abundance of heroes for/in us, wealth and thriving in me,” which would leave pavasva intransitive. However, this seems artificial, and the existence of two 1st ps. pronouns in b and c, in different numbers, would be awkward. Moreover, 27c, with an independent dádhat clause, speaks in favor of separating b and c here.
