title = "12"

+++
A similar type of construction as the immediately preceding verse, though the connection between epithet and its dynamic manifestation is clearer: the epithet śakráḥ ‘able’ is transformed into the verb śakat ‘he will be able’. For an almost identical construction see I.10.6 and discussion there.

In both 11 and 12 I take cid as marking the epithet to be transformed, though in 11a it is displaced to the left.

Ge interprets the hapax antarābhará- as “der zwischen den Kämpfen steht,” presuming an analysis antarā-bhará-, rejected by Old, who favors the Pp antaraābhará-. This fits the context better.
