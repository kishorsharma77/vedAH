Maruts  
Gr̥tsamada  
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 15  
Following immediately on a hymn dedicated to the Maruts’ father Rudra, this hymn  describes the Maruts, with the extravagant and imaginative phraseology typically  used of them, as the thunderstorm, while urging them to come to the singer’s sac rifice. About midway through the hymn (starting in vss. 6–7), the focus shifts to the  benefits the Maruts can provide the singer, in inspiring his hymn, protecting him  against enemies, and offering gifts. The naturalistic description remains, however;  note, for example, the sequential imagery in verse 13, which proceeds from thunder,  through lightning and rain, to the post-storm clearing and rainbow.  
The hymn also contains a reference (vs. 2) to the enigmatic and sometimes para doxical parentage and birth of the Maruts from Pr̥śni and Rudra. The motif of the  cow, especially the milk-cow with her swollen udder, runs through the hymn (e.g., vss.  1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12), with reference sequentially or simultaneously to dawns, clouds,  the sacrificer’s soma-pressings, and the Maruts’ gift to him. This multivalent image  helps to unify the hymn as it moves from naturalistic description to ritual entreaty.
