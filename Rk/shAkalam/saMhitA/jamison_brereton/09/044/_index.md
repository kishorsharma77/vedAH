Soma Pavamāna  
Ayāsya Āṅgirasa  
6 verses: gāyatrī  
The poet of the next three hymns (IX.44–46) seems to owe his Anukramaṇī identifi cation to the word ayā́sya “irrepressible” in the first verse of this first hymn, where it  is applied to Soma. Insofar as there is a theme in this hymn, it is Soma’s relation to  the gods (vss. 1, 3, 5) and his intermediary role between the gods and us, especially  us poets (vss. 2, 5).
