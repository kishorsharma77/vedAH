It is tempting to read diváḥ as abl. with áva caṣṭe: “looks down from heaven”; however, diváḥ śíśuḥ “child of heaven” is found elsewhere (IV.15.6, VI.49.2). It is certainly possible, however, to read diváḥ with both: “the child of heaven looks down from heaven.” The word is well positioned to look both left and right.
