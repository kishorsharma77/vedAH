Mitra and Varuṇa
Paruchepa Daivodāsi
7 verses: atyaṣṭi, except triṣṭubh 7
Though the paired divinities Mitra and Varuṇa dominate this hymn, they have  plenty of Ādityan company: Aryaman in verses 2, 3, 5, 6; Bhaga in verses 2 and  6; their mother Aditi in verse 3. And as the hymn nears its conclusion there are  non-Ādityan gods as well: Indra and Agni in verses 6–7, the Maruts in verse 7. The  hymn is defined by a ring formed by verses 1 and 6 (vs. 7 is in a different meter  and extra-hymnic), with matches of key words in both verses: “lofty,” “reverence,”  “compassionate,” and “approach with praise.”
Unlike many Mitra and Varuṇa hymns, the focus here is not on their ethical role,  but on their status as receivers of sacrificial offerings. The rising sun in verse 2 (see  also vs. 3) suggests the Morning Pressing, where Mitra and Varuṇa are among the  dual divinities who receive a joint cup of soma. The position of the hymn, imme
diately following two hymns to Vāyu, the first recipient of soma at the Morning  Pressing, supports this view.
