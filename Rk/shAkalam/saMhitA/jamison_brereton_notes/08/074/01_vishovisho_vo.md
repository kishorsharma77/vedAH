Nom. pl. part. vājayántaḥ (b) and 1st sg. stuṣé (d) represents the not unusual number mixture of a singular poet speaking for and with the other ritual officiants. Cf. VIII.66.1 for similar number mismatch.

Pāda-final vácaḥ I take (with Ge) as a truncated instr. standing for vácasā. For disc. see comm. ad VIII.39.2. However, in this context, since √stu can, though rarely, take an acc. of the praise, it is possible (with Old and Re [though Re seems to recant in his n.]) to take it as obj. of stuṣé in a construction different from the dominant agním … stuṣé. However, the acc. of the god praised continues in the next two verses, and I think it unlikely that this focus would be interrupted by “I speak a speech as praise.”
