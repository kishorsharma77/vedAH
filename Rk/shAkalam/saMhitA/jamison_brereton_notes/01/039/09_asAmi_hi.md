The signature word of this final tṛca is ásāmi-, Ge’s “vollkommen” “complete.” It literally means “without a half, not halved,” and the insistence on this unusual form merits a literal translation, in my view, although it is less fluent than the paraphrase.

káṇvaṃ dadá “you gave Kaṇva” -- the grammar is clear, but the meaning somewhat odd. What is presumably meant is the ancient poet Kaṇva, ancestral to the current line.
