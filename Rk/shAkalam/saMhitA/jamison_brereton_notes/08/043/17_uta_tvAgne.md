Despite the case disharmony between acc. tvā in a and the dat. phrase in b, I take them both as referring to Agni (so also Old). Ge takes the dat. in b as part of the simile in c, referring to a calf awaiting the cows coming to its stall. (Re’s tr.

seems to combine the two.) But vs. 2a ásmai te pratiháryate (and cf. VIII.44.2 práti … harya) establishes Agni as the primary referent here, though a secondary connection with a calf (via the bellowing) isn’t impossible. As for the case difference, vs. 2 provides a possible solution, since the verb there is jánāmi ‘I generate’, construed with the dat. of benefit. Hence my “(praises generated)” here.
