The referents of the plurals in this verse continue to be the Maruts of the previous verse, and I think that the same situation obtains: Indra is seeking the sacrifice and favor of the Maruts. I therefore supply iyakṣasi in this verse, again with sumnám as object. Thus one half of the VP is found in each verse: iyakṣasi in 17, sumnám in 18. (Ge also supplies the same verb stem, but in the 1st sg., referring to the poet.) The medial transitive-causative pātáyante I take as a reflexive: ‘cause themselves to fly, launch themselves in flight’.

On the pseudo-loc. absol. prā́dhvaré see comm. ad VIII.12.31-33.
