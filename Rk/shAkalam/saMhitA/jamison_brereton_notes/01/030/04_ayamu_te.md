ohase is generally taken as a 2nd sg. mid. to the root √ūh / oh, which has a messy set of forms. Cf., e.g., Ge. “Diese Rede von uns weisst du gewiss zu würdigen.” However, I interpret it as a 1st ps. -se form of the type stuṣé ‘I shall praise’, gṛṇīṣé ‘I shall sing’, all of which fall into this semantic sphere. Indeed the root has a -se formation of different shape in VIII.5.3 vā́cam … ohiṣe, with almost identical object (our passage: vácaḥ). For the thematic/(pseudo-)subjunctive form here, cf. arcase ‘I shall address” (X.64.3). Despite the complications involved in positing a second 1st ps. -se form to this root and separating ohase from the identical form in VIII.80.9, which I take as a 2nd sg. in passive usage, I prefer my interpretation to that of Ge (/WG) ‘value’, Re ‘take into consideration, take note of’, because these latter seriously attenuate or alter the meaning of the root, which otherwise means ‘solemnly proclaim, praise, vaunt oneself’.
