Some recycling and recombination from the last hymn: janúṣem uvoca combines janúṣem (20.3b) and uvoca (20.4d), each in its metrical position, and ándhaso mádeṣu echoes ándhasā mádeṣu of 20.4d.

devám appears to be one of the few adjectival forms of the stem, modifying neut. ándhaḥ. Although I would like to reduce the number of these supposed adjectival forms to zero, it is difficult to see what else to do with it here.
