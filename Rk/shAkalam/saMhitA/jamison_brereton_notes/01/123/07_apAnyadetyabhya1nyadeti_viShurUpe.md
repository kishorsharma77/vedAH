The du. parikṣítoḥ is universally taken (Ge [/WG], Re, Old, Scar [p. 96]) as referring to Heaven and Earth (e.g., Ge “das Dunkel der beiden umgebenden (Welten)”). In favor of this interpr. is the fact that the two other occurrences of the form do refer to H+E (III.7.1, X.65.8). However, I prefer to take it as referring to the pair already in the discourse, Night and Dawn. The cycling and circling movements of these two are highlighted in 7ab (and note pári yanti in 8d of the pl. Dawns). I also do not understand what “the darkness of H+E” would refer to, whereas Dawn’s role in hiding the darkness of night is well known. There is also a weak syntactic argument in favor of my interpr. Definite anyá- forms ordinarily take 2nd position (see Jamison 1997, Fs. Beekes); note the position of the two anyád in pāda a, each after the fronted preverb in its clause. (The anyā́ḥ in 11d belongs to the “(all) the other” construction, which is positioned differently.) If parikṣitóḥ is loosely connected with what follows, anyā́here follows the first real word of the clause támaḥ; otherwise it appears late.
