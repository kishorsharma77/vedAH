As noted above ad vs. 1, we have both thematized ínva- and athem. inó- in this hymn, with very similar objects: drávināni ‘movable goods’ (1c), vásūni ‘goods’ (3d). As was also noted above, ad VI.4.3, Ge (and others: cf. Gr and Re) construes the ví opening pāda d with inoṣi in c and uses this supposed lexeme to argue that ví … inóti in VI.4.3 has positive value. As I argued there, ví … inóti is more likely to mean ‘dispel’ and to take a negatively viewed object. In our passage here I do not think that ví belongs with inoṣi. Instead I think ví forms a phrase with immediately following ānuṣák; cf. the same pāda-initial expression I.58.3, 72.7, IV.12.3, as well as #ví … ānuṣák# 16.2. I assume that the expression arose from passages like I.72.7 vy ā̀nuṣak … dhāḥ “distribute in due order” with ví √dhā (reinforced here by vidhaté), and then ví and ānuṣák became phrasally fused.
