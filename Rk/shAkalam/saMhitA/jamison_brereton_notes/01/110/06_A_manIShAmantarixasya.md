The conceptual basis for the common trope of “pouring prayers” is made clear here by the simile “like ghee with a ladle.” Because of its lack of accent asya cannot modify pitúḥ and it should have a referent already present in the discourse. The referent is generally taken as the cup of 5 and its father as Tvaṣṭar. I do not have anything better to offer.

Ge’s tr. of c seems very loose and somewhat puzzling: “… die die Pünktlichkeit seines Vaters erreichten ...” He seems to be taking taraṇitvā́as neut. pl.

rather than instr. sg. (like taraṇitvéna in 4a) and imposing a meaning “erreichten” on saściré that stretches the semantics of that stem. Re makes a good case for the instr.

interpretation, and supplies an acc. “(l’exemple)” that allows the usual ‘follow’ sense for the verb. My tr. is similar.

vā́ja- in d is a low-key pun on the name of one of the Ṛbhus.
