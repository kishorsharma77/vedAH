The hapax adatrayā́is universally taken as an adverbial instr. built to a fem.

*adatrā- with the meaning ‘ohne Geschenk empfangen zu haben’ (Gr), ‘ohne ein
(Gegen)geschenk zu verlangen’ (Ge), ‘nicht geschenkweise’ (AiG III.76), etc. But the morphology rests on very little (there is no independent fem. -ā stem), and, so interpreted, the word is also hard to make sense of. If it means ‘in a nongiving/distributing fashion’, it is immediately contradicted by the statement that the gods do distribute good things (dayate vā́ryāṇi). To make it work somewhat better, most interpr. sneak in the notion of counter-gift: that is, the gods distribute good things without expectation of getting something in return. But this hardly fits the Vedic conceptual universe any better. Gods don’t selflessly hand out “free gifts”; they expect praise and oblations in return. This is, after all, the reciprocal arrangement that the whole RV rests on! I therefore suggest an entirely different analysis of the word, as adatra-yā́-, a root noun cmpd. with √yā ‘travel, drive’ as 2nd member, hence ‘traveling to those (so far) without gifts’. The accent is correct for such a cmpd. We need a nom. sg. with underlying final -s, but *-yā́s in sandhi would yield the -yā́found in the passage, so only the Pp. would need emendation. The cmpd.

would refer to the standard journey of gods to the sacrifice, bringing goods to distribute to the sacrificers; note the presence of the same root √yā in prayā́ṇam ‘advance’ in the preceding vs. 2a, referring to the same advent of the god(s) at the sacrifice.

As noted in the publ. intro., the vs. seems to refer to the distribution of dakṣiṇās, a ritual event that in RVic times happened at the dawn sacrifice (as here: vásta usráḥ), not at the Midday Pressing as in classical śrauta ritual.

This phrase vásta usráḥ is found 3 other times, all pāda final, with the other three occurrences (IV.25.2, VII.69.5, VIII.46.26; cf. also VI.3.6 vasta usrā́ḥ) containing usrā́ḥ. Although Gr classifies vásta as the 3rd sg. med. pres. of √vas ‘wear’ (that is, pausal form váste; so Pp.), it is clear from the phraseology that it must belong with √vas ‘dawn’, and is most likely a form of the loc. to vástu- ‘dawning’; see AiG III.153-54 with lit. cited there. I do not entirely understand the mechanism that produced the form we have, and in fact several different pathways have been suggested. Wackernagel simply attributes it to shortening of -ā in *vástā usr… <

*vástāvusr…, but I find the shortening hard to motivate. Others (e.g., Oldenberg)
suggest that it rests on a u-stem loc. sg. *-av / -o, which would yield the sequence directly, but at the cost of positing an alternative loc. sg. ending with little or no support.
