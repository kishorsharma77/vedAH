All of pāda c is a vocative, though it is syntactically peculiar for the noun in the simile to be in the vocative: áśve ná, literally “like o mare.” It must have been attracted into the voc. by the voc. adjectives that are the points of comparison: citre aruṣi “bright and ruddy.” See also I.57.3 below.
