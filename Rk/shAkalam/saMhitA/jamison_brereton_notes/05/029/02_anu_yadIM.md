Ge (/WG) take abhí yád áhim han as subordinate to ā́datta vájram in the same pāda. Although this fits the metrical scheme slightly better, it makes some trouble with the logical sequence of events (“he took the mace when he smashed the serpent,” almost implying that the smashing occurred first). It works better as subordinate to the main clause of d.

The word order áhim hán and the lack of augment on the verb scrambles the standard formula, producing almost a syncopated effect, which is repaired in 3d.
