Most tr. take suparṇáḥ in b as referring to the moon (candrámāḥ) in a, but in fact when suparṇá- refers to a heavenly body, it is always the sun. In keeping with the depiction of cosmic and earthly order at the beginning of the hymn, the regular alternation of the journeys of sun and moon opens the verse.

Most tr. take vidyutaḥ as referring not to the lightning flashes the word usually denotes, but to stars -- a departure that is simply incomprehensible to me.

The point of this verse seems fairly clear: three different sources of light in heaven are mentioned: moon, sun, and lightning. The alternation and the courses of sun and moon are predictable and regular, but that of the lightning is not -- as “they do not find your track” announces.

As stated in the publ. intro., I think the refrain is calling on Heaven and Earth to bear witness to the poet’s musings. The double genitive (or dat.-gen.) me asyá, with accented demonstrative, contrasts with te asmai in the last hymn (by the same poet), I.104.7a. In that passage I take unaccented asmai as picking up a referent already in the discourse, indriyá- in 6d (in accord with the usual distribution of the accented and unaccented oblique forms of the demonstrative). Here I take it as referring to a referent not yet in the discourse, the poet’s speech, again in accord with the usual distribution. Ge (/WG) oddly tr. as if it were a loc. (“in solcher Lage” / “in dieser Lage”; sim. Scar). Re takes it as coreferential with me: “moi tel (que je suis).” Old (ZDMG 61.826 [KlSch.257]) is closest to my interpr. For a somewhat similar expression see II.32.1ab, also X.10.5 in the Yama/Yamī hymn, in which Yama asserts that Heaven and Earth know “this” about them: véda nāv asyá prthivī́utá dyaúḥ.
