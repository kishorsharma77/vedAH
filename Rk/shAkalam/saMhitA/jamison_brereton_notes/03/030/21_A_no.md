Schaeffer (136) sees no particular repetitive function in the well-attested intensive dárdar-; she considers it simply lexicalized. Therefore my “keep breaking open” may impose a semantic nuance that does not belong to this stem. However, at the very least it takes pl. objects here (gotrā́, gā́ḥ), so it could be considered “objektsdistributiv” (for which term see Schaeffer 86-87).
