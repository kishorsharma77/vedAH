In pāda a the “gray messenger” is Agni, gray because of his ash; I take the fem. pl. āsu as referring to the plants (see vs. 5) that provide the fuel that feeds Agni’s flames. The fire “bears down on them” (/ “keeps pursuing them”; ní veveti) as it spreads over the firewood. (A reference to his hearths is also possible, but I think less likely.) In contrast to the earthly spread of the fire depicted in pāda a, b shows it rising towards heaven in its messenger role. I take rocanéna as an instr. of extent of space, rather than referring to Agni’s own luminosity with the standard tr. However, taking it in the latter way would not appreciably alter the sense of the pāda.

The publ. tr. is somewhat misleading, in having ‘bearing’ for both ní veveti in a and bíbhrat in c, though of course English ‘bear’ has entirely different senses in the two idioms.
