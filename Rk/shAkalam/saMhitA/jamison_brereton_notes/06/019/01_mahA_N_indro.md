The publ. tr. should read “manfully” with adverbial nṛvát.

On possible configurations of the terms connected by utá, see Klein DGRV I.341.

Gr derives aminá- from √am (‘mächtig andringend, gewaltig’), but it must belong to √mī as thematic parallel to áminant-. See Old (ZDMG 55.323).

The phrase in d, súkṛtaḥ kartṛ́bhir bhūt “he was well made by his makers,” is somewhat startling as a description of the great god Indra. Who are his makers? Is this a depiction of his original creation, or does it have a more narrow and current application? Because of the previous pāda, … vāvṛdhe vīryā̀ya “he has been strengthened for his heroic deed,” I am inclined towards the latter: the soma drinks and ritual activities and praise have made him the consummate heroic actor. The pl.

agent noun kartár- may refer to the soma drinks or to the priests who prepared and offered them to Indra. Because I think the reference is to the immediate past, I would slightly alter the tr. from “was well made” to “has been well made.”
