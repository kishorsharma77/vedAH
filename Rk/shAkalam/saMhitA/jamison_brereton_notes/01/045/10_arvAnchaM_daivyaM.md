I tr. sudānavaḥ as “you of good drops,” rather than “of good gifts,” which is always also possible for this ambiguous stem, because of “the Maruts of good drops” (marútaḥ sudā́navaḥ) who ended the previous hymn (44.14) in the same structural position. But as a general descriptor of the gods in this verse it might be better as “of good gifts.” [I.46-47 JPB]
