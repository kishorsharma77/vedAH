yajñá- is the focus of this vs., with 5 occurrences of it or a transparent deriv.

I take várdhanaḥ as the predicate of pāda b as well as pāda a (“the meal is also your strengthener”); the standard tr. take b as an independent nominal clause with priyáḥ as its predicate (“the meal is dear to you”). There is no way to tell for certain; the absence of te in b gives some support to my interpr., but that support is undeniably weak. The difference between the two tr. is also not large and has no effects on the interpr. of the rest of the vs. The second hemistich expresses the reciprocity of the sacrificial enterprise, neatly shown by the balanced verb forms to the same root √av ‘aid, help’: impv. ava (c), impf. āvat (d). But the reciprocity is curiously indirect: Indra is asked to aid the sacrifice (rather than the sacrificer[s]), and the sacrifice aided Indra’s mace (not Indra himself). In both clauses the direct object is an inanimate entity standing in for an animate one, and in the second clause the subject is inanimate as well. Only Indra is animate and capable of acting.

The nom. sg. pres. part. sán ‘being’ is not used concessively (“although being …”) as it normally is. I think it may have the same force as it does in III.30.5, a “definitional” one: Indra is by definition the one deserving of / derivationally associated with the sacrifice, and therefore he is the one who should aid it.
