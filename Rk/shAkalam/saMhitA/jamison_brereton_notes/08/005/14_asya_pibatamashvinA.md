The partitive gen. with pibatam consists of the phrase asyá … mádasya cā́ruṇaḥ / mádhvo rātásya, rendered in the publ. tr. (sim. Ge) as “ of “this dear exhilarating drink, of the honey bestowed,” which faithfully represents the hemistich boundary. However, it also construes the adj. cā́ruṇaḥ with masc. mádasya, though u-stem sg. oblique forms with interposed -n- should of course only be neut. This is in fact the only certain ex. of such a masc. form given by Lanman (Noun inflec., 410).

There are several ways to avoid this undesirable morphological analysis. The least attractive is to take máda- here as adjectival, but this exceptionally well-attested stem is otherwise only a noun. The other two possibilities are better. On the one hand, the rest of the gen. phrase includes the neut. noun mádhvaḥ, and cā́ruṇaḥ can be construed with it: “of this exhilarating drink, of the dear honey …” The drawback is that this artificially splits the gen. in b and reads part of it across the hemistich boundary. Perhaps the best solution is suggested by the other four occurrences of cā́ruṇaḥ, which always modifies amṛ́tasya ‘(drink) of immortality’, with the nominalized amṛ́ta- neuter (IV.70.2, 4; 108.4; 100.4, always in the order amṛ́tasya cā́ruṇaḥ, pāda-final as here). I suggest we read cā́ruṇaḥ here as representing that phrase and tr. “of this exhilarating drink, of the dear (drink of immorality), of the honey …”
