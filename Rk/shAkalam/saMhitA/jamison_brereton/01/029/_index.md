29  
Indra  
Śunaḥśepa Ājīgarti  
7 verses: paṅkti  
The last three pādas of each five-pāda verse in this hymn constitute a refrain beg ging Indra to give us hope of acquiring abundant livestock. The refrain fits well  in the first two verses, but then the hymn takes an odd turn, expressing increasing  hostility toward a variety of unidentified or unidentifiable (see the near hapaxes in  vss. 6–7) beings, while continuing to hope blandly for cows and horses in the refrain.  The hymn is reminiscent of the “sleep charm” (VII.55), though the latter is more  benign in intent, and I.29 also has an Atharvan cast.
