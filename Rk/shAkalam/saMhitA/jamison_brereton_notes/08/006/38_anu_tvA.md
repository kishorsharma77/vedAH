The publ. tr. of a and c may be difficult to parse in English: “after you (roll)…” does not contain a temporal conjunction (“after”) followed by a subject + verb, but rather a prepositional phrase (“after you,” that is, “following you”) followed by a verb with postposed subject (“both worlds” / “the drops”).

The isolated verb form varti is, curiously, identified as an injunctive by Lub, despite the apparent primary ending. Gr considers it a development of *vart-ti, which is phonologically possible. I don’t have a firmly founded analysis of it, but I wonder, since outside of the perfect, intransitive forms of √vṛt are medial, if this is actually a “passive aorist,” which displays the expected strong form and -i ending, in which case Lub’s inj. label would be correct.

In c svānā́saḥ is a pun: it can either be the nom. pl. m. of the mediopassive participle of the root aorist to √su ‘press’ or nom. pl. m. to the thematic nominal svāná- ‘sounding, sound’. See VIII.7.14, 17.
