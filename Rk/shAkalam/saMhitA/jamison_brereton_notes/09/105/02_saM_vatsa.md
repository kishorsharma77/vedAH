Pāda a in both hymns has both the calf (acc. in 104, nom. in 105) and its mothers (both instr.), as well as the init. preverb sám and a simile particle (ná in 104, iva in 105). The b pādas are quite different. The c pādas begin with the same two words, devāvī́- máda-, acc. in 104, nom. in 105. Again the rest of the c pāda diverges.
