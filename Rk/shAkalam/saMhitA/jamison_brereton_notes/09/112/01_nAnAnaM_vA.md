The first word of the vs., the hapax nānānám, is an adjectival derivative built to the adv. nā́nā ‘various’, used as an adverb (though for simplicity I have tr. as if an adj.). As Thieme suggests (Unters. 54), it’s a rhyme form to samāná- ‘same’, and nā́nā and samāná- appear together contrastively elsewhere (cf. II.12.8, III.54.6 adduced by Thieme). In our passage it also provides a polarized mirror-image to the word ending the hemistich: #nānānám … jánānām# with reversed vowel quantities (ā ā a … a ā ā) but matching consonantal structure (save for the initial), though the necessary distraction of the last syllable of jánānām disturbs the pattern somewhat.

Pāda c provides a nice example of chiasmus, with the nom. agents at each end and the acc. goals, with similar shape, in the middle: tákṣā riṣṭáṃ rutáṃ bhiṣák.
