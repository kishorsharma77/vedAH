Another slightly off expression: with monotonous regularity throughout the RV Agni is described as ‘sitting’ or ‘sitting down” or “made to sit (down)’. Although ‘sit’ in these locutions is always expressed by the root √sad, it still seems odd to characterize the human ritualist as ‘sitting’ (āsānáḥ, using the regularized participle to √ās, not āsīná-), in a context where we might expect the referent to be Agni.

The expression dadhiṣe suvṛktím “repairs” both vs. 1 and vs. 2. In 1a we had the adj. suvṛktím, which had to be a masc. referring to Agni and therefore a secondary bahuvrīhi. Here suvṛktí- has its usual meaning of ‘well-twisted (hymn)’ and is presumably fem. As for dadhiṣe, recall that I suggest supplying a medial form of √dhā to govern stómam in 2. Here we have the full VP.
