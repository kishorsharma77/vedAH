This vs. is very difficult. As I see it, the point of the vs. is to demand that Agni not track down and punish the speaker for the transgressions of others, esp.

others who are close to the speaker and could be mistaken for him. In the first hemistich this notion is expressed by GEN yakṣá- “the specter/apparition of X,” where yakṣá- could perhaps best be rendered as Doppelgänger.

The first problem one encounters is kásya and the puzzle of how an interrogative would interact with the prohibitive mā́. The standard solution is to treat kásya as an indefinite, without the usual particle (cid, caná) to mark this value -- e.g., Re “… de qui (que ce soit).” But when the negative ná is used, the indefinite ‘no one, nothing’ always has the particle. I propose instead to read *akásya ‘of (a) nobody’.

With an accent like that of akútra ‘nowhere’, this interpr. does not require emending the Saṃhitā text (which would read mā́kásya), only the Pp., and the same stem is found three times elsewhere in the same context, at least by my interpr.: V.70.4 mā́ kásya (in a passage very similar to this one), mā́kásya in VII.94.8, and I.120.8 mā́ kásmai, parallel to mā́kútrā where the Pp. analyzes the first as mā́kásmai but the 2nd as mā́akútra. The apparent presence of mā́-akútra in this last passage reinforces my interpr. of mā́kásya / kásmai as also containing a privative a-. It might be argued that nákis, nákīm (the former of which is very common) and mā́kis, mā́kīm lack the indefinitizing particle, but all these forms show univerbation and loss of the accent on the 2nd element.

The form huráḥ has been variously analyzed. Old (etc) takes it as an adv., and Ge (etc.) as the gen. of a root noun. (For detailed disc. see Scar [123], who vacillates.) I follow the latter view, but see it not as an abstract but as a personal gen. referring to one of the transgressors. (This seems to be the WG interpr., too.) In d Old suggests emending dákṣam to yakṣám (matching the same form in pāda a and found elsewhere with bhujema), but it is hard to see how this error could have arisen. I think rather that dákṣa- is used here ironically or sarcastically.

On mā́with the apparent opt. bhujema, see Hoffmann (Injunk., 95-97), who explains this grammatical anomaly (found several times) as a misinterpr. of expressions with the dat. inf. bhujé.
