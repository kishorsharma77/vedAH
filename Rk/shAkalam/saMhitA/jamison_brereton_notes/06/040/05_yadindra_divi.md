The disjunctive construction marked by two occurrences of vā ‘or’ describing the possible places where Indra might be contains three non-parallel terms: an adv. ṛ́dhak, a loc. NP své sádane, and a dep. clause with locatival subordinator yátra ... ási. It is also a nice instance of Behaghel’s Law.

A verb of motion has to be supplied in c, but this is amply anticipated by ā́ yāhi in 3d and 4a. Assuming this impv. should be supplied in c, it rhymes with pāhi in d.
