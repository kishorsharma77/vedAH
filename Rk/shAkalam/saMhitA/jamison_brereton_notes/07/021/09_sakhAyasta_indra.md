vanvántu ‘let them combat’ and vanúṣām ‘rapacious ones’ are presumably derived from the originally separate roots van ‘win, vanquish’ and vani ‘love, desire’, but since these roots have become synchronically entangled, the pair presents itself like an etymological figure, like I.132.1=VIII.40.7 vanuyā́ma vanuṣyátaḥ “may we win against those who seek to win.”
