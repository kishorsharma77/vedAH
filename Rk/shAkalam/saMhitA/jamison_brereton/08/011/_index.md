Agni
Vatsa Kāṇva
10 verses: gāyatrī, except pratiṣṭhā 1, vardhamāna 2, triṣṭubh 10, arranged in trcas, ̥ with a final verse
This is the last hymn in the Vatsa group and the only one dedicated to Agni.  Compared to earlier hymns in the cycle it is both brief and, as Renou points out  (EVP 13: 147), elementary. Nonetheless it is a pleasing composition, with adroit  deployment of contrastive terms, such as “mortal/god,” and of parallel structures,  such as “to be X-ed at Y” (vss. 1, 2, 10—the last also providing a simple ring).
