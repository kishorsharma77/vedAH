This gods listed in this vs. are dual divinities, each with Indra as the first part of the pair and all expressed in dual dvandvas. All have the expected double accent except indrāgnī́in pāda a, which always lacks an accent on the first member in its numerous occurrences. Re suggests this is because the putative dual ending on

*índrā- is not perceived because of its coalescence with the initial vowel of agnī́.

This is fairly plausible, though there are a number of instances where the word must be read with four syllables and there the dual ending of the 1st member should have been recoverable.
