There is puzzling agreement about the meaning of the hapax cakramāsajá-.

The standard interpr. run counter to the clear structure of the cmpd: a tatpuruṣa with the first member the acc. sg. of cakrá- ‘wheel’ (the acc. blocking hiatus before a vocalic 2nd member) and the 2nd derived from ā́√sa(ñ)j. The lexeme ā́√sa(ñ)j means ‘attach, affix, hang’ (I.191.10, X.124.7); yet this cmpd is universally interpr. as meaning ‘impeding/stopping the wheel’ (Gr, Ge, AiG II.1.183, EWA s.v. SAÑJ) or, acdg. to WG, ‘die Wagen bremsend’ with cakra- as pars pro toto. I do not understand this consensus that the verbal portion should be given a meaning not found with the verb itself, particularly since the context does not impose it. (Sāy.’s gloss rathacakrasyāsañjayitā does not seem to be responsible for it either.) Only WG attempt to trace a semantic pathway to the meaning attributed to āsajá-, but it is not persuasive. I suppose all these interpr. are thinking of the myth in which Indra tears the wheel off the sun’s chariot, but there is no other indication in context that this myth is at issue -- and tearing off and stopping are quite different actions. Given these objections, I prefer to stick with the standard meaning of ā́√sa(ñ)j and assume 1) that it refers to the restoration of the sun’s wheel mentioned in regard to Etaśa in nearby V.31.11, or 2) that is refers to an incident in an unknown story, or 3) that it refers to some pre-batttle preparation or battle tactic. I prefer the first.
