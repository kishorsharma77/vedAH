Ge takes nṛ́̄n as gen. pl. rather than acc., but this is unnec. The stem nṛ́- is regularly used of gods, esp. the Maruts, so there is no reason that they cannot be addressees here (so Re, WG).

The standard tr. take dhányā sajóṣā dhiṣáṇā as nom. sg. and parenthetic; e.g., Ge “—einverstanden ist die reichmachende Dhiṣaṇā—” But the instr. sg. in -ā to fem.

-ā-stems is still quite common in the RV, and that is how I construe the phrase here.
