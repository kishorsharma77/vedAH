The voc. nárā in b was carelessly omitted in the publ. tr. Insert “o superior men.”3 In c the phrase dyā́vó ’habhiḥ is rendered “the days with their daytimes” by all standard tr. However, although there are undeniable instances of pl. dyā́vaḥ meaning ‘days’ (e.g., VI.24.7, 38.4) and áhabhiḥ is suggestive, I prefer ‘heavens’, which is the more common meaning of nom. dyā́vaḥ. I.130.10 áhobhir iva dyaúḥ, with the nom. sg., where ‘heaven’ is the only possible interpr., supports ‘heavens’ here. The context of our passage gives no help either way: dyā́vaḥ is conjoined with síndhavaḥ ‘rivers’, which would not seem to form a natural class either with ‘heavens’ or with ‘days’ (though see Klein, DGRV 2.144 for other exx. of ‘heaven’ conjoined with waters of some sort), and the statements “the heavens have not attained your divinity” and “the days have not attained your divinity” are almost equally puzzling -- though I’d give the edge of sense of the former.
