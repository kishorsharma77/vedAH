For the association of barháṇā and ukthá- see VI.44.6 ukthásya barháṇā.

Pāda b contains one of the few exx. of the “-si imperative” that betrays its non-imperatival source, since dárṣi occurs in a subord. cl., from which imperatives are barred. Here it shows its original subjunctive value in a purpose cl. (so also Hoffmann, 183).

Initial áva in c breaks the long pattern of 2nd sg. pronouns beginning the hemistich (vss. 2-5a, resumed vss. 6, 7c, with such forms also beginning even pādas 2d, 4d, 7b). Perhaps it is meant to resonate with 4b #ā́vo, 5d #prā́vo.
