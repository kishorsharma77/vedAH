Ge (/WG) take the pf. part. dádṛśānaḥ as a mere attributive adj. with āpíḥ (“visible friend”), while I give it a more verbal sense. If my reflexive ‘showing yourself’ seems too strong, I would still prefer a participial ‘being seen as / becoming visible’ to a straight adjective. Once again, we are hoping for Indra’s epiphany on the ritual ground.

In d in the publ. tr. I take kártā independently and construe ulókam as obj. of the part. uśaté (“longing for wide space”) against Ge (/WG). I now see that this is wrong, as the parallel expressions with kártā … ulókam show (VI.23.3, VII.20.2).

Both of those passages also have a dat. of benefit, vīrā́ya and sudā́se respectively, but neither of those datives is capable of governing an acc. I would therefore emend my tr. to “maker of wide space for the man who longs (for it), conferring vitality.” As this emended tr. shows, I still think ulókam can be secondarily taken as the obj. of uśaté. This same part. uśaté can also serve as dat. of benefit with vayodhā́ḥ. Note the dat. stuvaté with váyo dhāḥ in the next vs. (18b).
