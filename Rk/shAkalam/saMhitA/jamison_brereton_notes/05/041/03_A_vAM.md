I take the passively used inf. huvádhyai with a gapped agent “by the priests” vel sim., to match the implicit 2nd pl. subj. of prá … bharadhvam in the 2nd hemistich.

The use of a passive inf. in the 1st half, contrasting with an active usage (though not an inf. here) in the 2nd half, recalls the structure of vs. 1. In our vs. there is a switch of 2nd ps. reference from the (two) gods in ab to the (pl.) mortal officiants in cd.

The use of the derived adj. ráthya- ‘belonging to the chariot’ rather than its base noun rátha- recalls pā́rthivasya in 1c substituting for a form of the noun pṛthivī́-.

Ge (flg. Sāy.) identifies the “lord of heaven” (divó ásura-) as Rudra, on the basis of parallels (see his n. 3c).
