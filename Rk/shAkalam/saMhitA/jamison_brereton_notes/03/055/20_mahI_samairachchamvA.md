I assume that the subject of this vs. is Indra. One of his standard cosmogonic deeds involves the creation and separation of the two worlds, the separation here implied by the material crammed between them. Indra is of course commonly identified as a vīrá-; he also “finds goods” (e.g., II.13.11, VIII.61.5), though so do other gods as well as mortals.
