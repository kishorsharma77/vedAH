Vs. 3 also contains forms of both mánman- and śastí-.

On sám √jṛ see Gotō (1st cl., 154-55), who considers the two instances of this lexeme (also in the next hymn, IV.4.8) an individual use of this poet, in the meaning ‘be welcome’ [willkommen sein]. In both cases it has a verbal product of the poet as subj. (śastí- here, gír- IV.4.8). My ‘bring harmony’ is meant to capture the ‘sing’ feature of the root √jṛ. Perhaps ‘be harmonious’ would have been better. For further disc. see ad IV.4.8 below.
