Indra
Indra Muṣkavant
5 verses: jagatī
The fanciful name of the poet in the Anukramaṇī (“Indra possessing testicles”)  is extracted from the final pāda of the poem (5d); the hymn clearly belongs with  the other compositions of Luśa (X.35–38). It is a martial hymn, calling on Indra  to fight on our side in pitched battles, vanquishing our enemies and sharing the  booty he acquires. The style is lively and at times slangy, especially in the final verse,  with its surprise ending: depicted as all powerful in the rest of the hymn, Indra is  revealed to be not entirely free, but in some unspecified thrall to Kutsa (otherwise  a client of Indra’s in the R̥gveda), and the poet taunts Indra to break the bonds.
