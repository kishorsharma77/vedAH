Ge unaccountably takes injunctive vidán as modal: “Die sollen wirklich (etwas) vorfinden,” but asanan (flg. Pp.) as preterital. As Old points out, however, the latter need not be augmented (with Pp.) but represent dvitā́sanan with an injunctive, a reading favored by the apparent parallelism with vidán. I follow the injunctive reading, but take both vidán and sanan as preterital in function. I also don’t think that an object should be supplied with either of these verbs, contra Ge (“etwas,” which he further specifies in n. 1 as “die Opferspenden”) and Re (“un trésor pour l’Homme”). The absence of objects with two verbs that are standardly transitive must be deliberate. Note the absolute use of vindate in VIII.27.17.
