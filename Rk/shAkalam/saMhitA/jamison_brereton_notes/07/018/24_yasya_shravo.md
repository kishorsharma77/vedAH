The śrávas- in pāda a echoes the one in 23d.

Ge, flg. Sāy., takes ab as separate clauses, supplying “(sich ausbreitet)” as the verb in pāda a. This is unnecessary: the hemistich can be a single clause, with the accent on vibabhā́jā in b conditioned by the rel. yásya in a. (Ge considers this possibility in n. 24ab.) Kü (333) also follows the single clause interpr.

Note the lengthened 3rd sg. pf. ending in babhā́jā, guaranteed (and required) by the cadence. On lengthening of the pf. endings see the brief remarks by Kü (42), though without any indication of the relative frequency; it is my impression that lengthening of the 1st/3rd sg. -a is quite rare in the RV, but I haven’t made a count.

The fame being distributed is presumably that of Sudās, though covertly assimiliated to Indra’s; note the explicit comparison of the praise he receives to Indra’s in the simile in c. The āmreḍita “every head” (śīrṣṇé-śīrṣṇe) must refer to every person, or rather every person eligible for fame (excluding women and nonelite males), in Sudās’s entourage: they all get a piece of the fame-pie that he acquired by himself. The geographical extravagance of “every head between the two wide world halves” -- that is, every eligible person on earth -- is presumably part of a totalizing claim about the outcome of the Ten Kings’ Battle, that the whole world was brought under Sudās’s sway. 14 The loud sound of rivers in flood is the point of the comparison in c. One of the words for ‘river’, nadī́, is folk etymologically (and probably etymologically; see EWA s.v.) connected with √nad ‘roar’, as in the explicit etymological statement in AV III.13.1 yád adáḥ saṃprayatī́r áhāv ánadatā haté / tásmād ā́nadyò nā́ma stha Wh “Since formerly (? adás) going forth together, ye resounded (nad) when the dragon was slain, therefore ye are streams (nadī́) by name.” The signature verb ní √śā ‘whet down’ that we have met a number of times before (see comm. ad vs. 6) now implicitly takes Sudās as its subject, as a sort of climactic usage.

The PN yudhyāmadhí is obviously a speaking name, with some form of √yudh ‘fight’ embedded in it. See Old for various possibilites for its formation. It is tempting to see as its base a 1st pl. middle *yúdhyāmahi “let’s fight,” with the older expected 1st pl. ending *-madhi before de-occlusion.
