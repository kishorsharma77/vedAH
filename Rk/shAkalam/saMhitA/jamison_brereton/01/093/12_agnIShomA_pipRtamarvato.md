Agni and Soma, deliver our steeds (to safety). Let the ruddy (cows) who  sweeten the oblations swell up.
In us and in our benefactors establish powers. Give our ceremony an  attentive hearing.

Most of the next 22 hymns (94–115) are attributed to Kutsa Āṅgirasa by the  Anukramaṇī. Though a few (99–100, alternatively 105) have other poets named,  the presence of the Kutsa refrain in both 100 and 105 (99 is a one-verse hymn)  supports the unity of the collection. The Kutsa refrain, in triṣṭubh, “This let Mitra  and Varuṇa grant to us, and Aditi, River, and Earth and Heaven,” occupies the  last hemistich of the last verse of every hymn except I.97 (a gāyatrī hymn), 99 (a  one-verse hymn), and 104 (though this last hymn is in triṣṭubh).
The Agni hymns (94–99) are each dedicated to a different form of Agni. There  follow, in the normal order, five hymns to Indra, three to the All Gods, with miscel laneous other divinities making up the collection. The collection is at a generally  high level of poetic craftsmanship, but we will only single out for special mention  104, a challenging Indra hymn, 105, a famous and enigmatic All God hymn, and  the lovely Dawn hymn 113.
