Indra
Gr̥tsamada
21 verses: virāṭsthānā triṣṭubh, except triṣṭubh 21
Judging from its frequent references to the winds, this Indra hymn was composed  to accompany the day’s first soma-pressing, which anciently belonged especially to  Indra and Vāyu, the Wind. It is also a good example of the complexity of R̥gvedic  poetry. The poet uses ellipses and ambiguous reference to suggest the union of  the acts of the accompanying ritual and the action of the myth. In verse 3, for  example, the “resplendent” (śubhrá) ones who run to the wind are the Maruts, the  gods who so often accompany Indra. But the adjective “resplendent” is also used of  soma, and therefore the verse carries a second, suggested meaning that the offering  of soma goes to the Wind, who receives the soma along with Indra. Or again, in  verses 7–8, it appears at first as though the mountain described there is one of the  mountains settled by Indra when he made the world habitable. But this mountain is  described in odd ways: it does not falter; it bellows with its mothers; and it roars— descriptions that force a reconsideration of its identity. Elsewhere these epithets  characterize the fire, which is “settled” by priests on the sacrificial area. Thus, the  creative actions of the god and the ritual actions of the priests are placed in parallel  and made reflexes of one another. For a detailed analysis of this hymn, which seeks  to demonstrate its double reference to myth and ritual, see Brereton (1985).
