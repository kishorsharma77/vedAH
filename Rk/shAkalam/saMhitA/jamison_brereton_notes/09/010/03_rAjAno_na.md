The first hemistich contains a simile embedded, as it were, in a metaphor: kings are only metaphorically “anointed” (that is, decorated, adorned) with praises; the soma juices are somewhat less metaphorically “anointed,” since “the cows” are actually milk, which is liquid enough to anoint.

In c the poet seems silently to switch instrumental functions, while holding the structure constant: NOM. INSTR. añjate. In both a and b the INSTR. expresses the instrument of anointment, either metaphorical or real, but in c the INSTR. expresses the agents who perform the anointing. The “seven ordainers” (saptá dhātár-) are presumably the priests; the priests reappear as Hotars in vs. 7 with “seven siblings,” probably their insightful thoughts or else simply seven other priests. See below.

The relationship between kings and the genre of práśasti-, which I discuss in my RV between Two Worlds (pp. 146-48), is very clear here.
