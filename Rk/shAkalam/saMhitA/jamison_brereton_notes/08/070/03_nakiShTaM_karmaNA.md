The identity of “him” in “No one will catch up with him…” is not sufficiently signalled in the publ. tr. I take it to refer to the successful sacrificer (cf. VIII.31.17), who ritually strengthens and thus “has created” Indra. However, the perfect cakā́ra could instead signal mythic time; both Ge and Old believe this refers to the original creator of Indra, as in IV.17.4. The reference to Indra’s birth in 4cd may support their position.
