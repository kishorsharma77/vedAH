With Ge and Re (who follow Sāy.) I supply ‘horse’ as the headnoun on which jigyúṣaḥ (‘of the one having won / of a victor’) depends in the simile marked by yathā. This seems reasonable, even though there is little positive evidence for it.

The pf. part. jigiváṃs- / jigyúṣ- doesn’t enter into a similar construction elsewhere, and the subj. of (pári) √dhāv is overwhelmingly Soma. Otherwise we occasionally find cows (VIII.22.4, IX.66.6, X.145.6), but “runs like the cow of a victor” does not impose itself. In IX.87.7 we do find a steed (árvan-: … pári sómaḥ pavítre … adadhāvad árvā), and that parallel will have to do. The simile in the 2nd hemistich, vājī́va sānasíḥ “like a winner bringing prizes” reinforces this interpr., since vājínregularly modifies ‘horse’, but of course similes in the same vs. don’t have to have the same content.
