The expression asmábhyam … víśvataḥ “for us all around” in b I take as a heavy specification of enclitic naḥ in Wackernagel’s position in pāda a. Most take víśvataḥ as qualifying “wealth.” The fact that this pāda (asmábhyaṃ soma víśvataḥ) appears 3x (also IX.33.6, 65.21) suggests that víśvataḥ goes with ‘us’; on the other hand, that all three occurrences involve the acquisition of wealth or other good things somewhat undercuts that argument.

On mahā́m see AiG III.251.
