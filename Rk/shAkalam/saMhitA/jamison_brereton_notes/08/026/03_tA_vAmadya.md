havāmahe havyébhiḥ “we call with oblations” is a word play between the the roots √hu ‘pour, libate’ and √hū/hvā ‘call’ and economically refers to the two complementary aspects of Vedic sacrifice, the verbal and the material. It is the mirror image of the trope “pour prayers.” iṣáyantau can belong either to trans. iṣáyati to √iṣ ‘send’ (so Gr, Lub) or intrans. iṣáyati ‘prosper’. I tentatively opt for the latter, with a cognate acc. of respect, iṣáḥ, hence “prosper, become refreshed with respect to refreshments.” It is not entirely clear to me which root affiliation is represented by Ge’s “spenden” (probably ‘send’?) or Re’s “sécrétant à titre de jouissance” (probably ‘prosper’?).

I suggest that áti kṣapáḥ “beyond the nights” refers to the Atirātra soma (“overnight soma”) offered to the Aśvins the morning after, as it were.
