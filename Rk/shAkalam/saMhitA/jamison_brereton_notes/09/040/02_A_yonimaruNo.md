Both Ge and Re treat ruhat as modal, parallel to the clear aor. subj. gámat in the following pāda (e.g., “… soll … besteigen, … soll … gehen”). But ruhat belongs to a clear them. aor. áruhat, and its zero-grade root syll. would preclude a subjunctive in any case; formally it must be an injunc. I take the sequence of verbs as referring to different stages of the ritual process, one that has just occurred, one that will now occur. KH (Injunk. 222) in fact suggests that the transmitted injunc. ruhat might represents a redactional error for ’ruhat, an augmented aor. in this sandhi context. Hoffmann’s suggestion of course results from his idiosyncratic and restrictive views on the function of the injunctive; in my opinion injunc. ruhat would work fine here as an immed. past, preceding soma’s departure for Indra. (Maur’s tr. [84] is sim. to mine.)
