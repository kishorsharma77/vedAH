This verse attributes primal creative power to Agni first in the ritual realm (ab), then in the cosmic realm (c). Ge (/WG) supply a different verb in c (“bescheint”), presumably because Agni is not usually credited with cosmogonic powers. But there is no contextual support for a new verb here, and in parallel clauses containing only one verb the default interpretation is to supply the same verb with the second clause. Given how much generative power is ascribed to the Vedic sacrifice, it is not surprising that Agni’s ability to engender Manu’s people, that is, those who sacrifice like Manu, can then be extended to his ability to beget the major cosmic features -- esp. as in this enterprise he is partially identified with the sun.

Note that in 4c he is explicitly named as “the begetter of the two worlds” (janitā́ ródasyoḥ) as well as “the finder of the sun” (svarvíd).
