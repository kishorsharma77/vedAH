The publ. tr. does not capture the etymological play between the transitive nominal jánana- (3x in ab) and the first word of the 2nd hemistich, intrans.-passive jātá-, which could have been tr. ‘begotten’ to reflect this etym. figure. However, this tr. seems a little stiff and would not work with jā́yamānau in 2a.

It is only in d that it becomes clear that the dual nominal phrases in the first 3 pādas are in the acc. and are the obj. of akṛṇvan.
