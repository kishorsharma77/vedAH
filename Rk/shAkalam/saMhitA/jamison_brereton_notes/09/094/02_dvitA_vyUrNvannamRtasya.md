The nom. part. vyūrṇván in pāda is sg., while the finite verb prathanta in b is pl. Old and Ge attribute this to anacoluthon, with the nom. of pāda a coreferential with the dat. svarvíde in b, while acdg. to Tichy (loc. cit., n. 35) the participle is the predicate of pāda a (“Partizip im Nominative an Stelle eines Verbum finitum”). With Re, I instead take pāda a as a continuation of vs. 1, with a new construction beginning in b.

The referent of amṛ́tasya in the phrase amṛ́tasya dhā́ma is not clear. Ge: the drink of immortality, Re: the immortal principle, Lü (257) and Tichy (loc. cit.): immortality. By contrast I think it may refer to the sun (as I also suggest in the nearby passage IX.97.32); the immediately following description of Soma as ‘finder of the sun’ (svarvíd-) supports this interpr. “Disclosing the domain of the sun” may refer to the Dawn-like behavior of Soma at the morning pressing (see Ge’s n. 2b “Wie bei Sonnenaufgang”), or to his plunging into the milk mixture that is often assimilated to the sun - probably the latter. The adv. dvitā́‘once again’ expresses the regular repetition of the sacrifice.
