Rather than supplying a verb to govern ánnā (e.g., Ge “die Speisen (verzehrend)”), I allow tṛṣúṇā ‘thirsting (for)’ to govern the acc. In b the standard tr. supply ‘wind’: “he makes the thirsty (wind) his messenger.” I resist this because it is Agni who is always the messenger (e.g., in this hymn 4a, 8a, 8c, 9d), and so I think it more likely that in this case Agni is making some part of himself (flame) into that messenger. A small problem is the masc.

gender of tṛṣúm: the words for ‘flame, blaze’ in this hymn are neut. (arcís- 9b, śocís5c, 10b). However, a word like m. śóka- is always available, or we could attribute the masc. of tṛṣúm to attraction to dūtám or even take it as the modifier of dūtám (“he makes [his flame] into a thirsty messenger”).
