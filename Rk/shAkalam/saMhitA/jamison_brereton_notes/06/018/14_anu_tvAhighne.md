The aor. subjunctive káraḥ is generally taken as preterital, an interpr.

licensed by Gr, who identifies it as “Impf.” But this is morphologically irresponsible, and further, given the injunc. mádan in the main cl. (b), a proper subj. value is quite possible. I think this is an example of the standard rhetorical move to take Indra’s signal mythological deeds and make them a model for his behavior in the future, to our benefit. The next and final vs. continues this point of view. See Hoff (Injunk. 55 and n. 37) for a similar assessment, though he also envisions the possibility of “Konjunktiv im präteritalen Sachverhalt.”
