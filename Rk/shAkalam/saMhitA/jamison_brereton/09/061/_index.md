Soma Pavamāna  
Amahīyu Āṅgirasa  
30 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
The first sixty hymns of the Soma Maṇḍala, all in gāyatrī meter, are arranged in the  normal order of descending number of verses, starting with hymns of ten verses  and ending with those of four. (The only exception is the Āprī hymn, IX.5, which  has eleven.) But the gāyatrī sequence ends with six thirty-verse hymns (IX.61–66),  followed by one with thirty-two verses (IX.67)—all arranged in tr̥cas (the final two  verses in IX.67 are supplements) and each attributed to a different poet or group  of poets—before the jagatī group begins. It is probably not an accident that these  groupings of tr̥cas come at the end of the gāyatrī sequence, since, as agglomerations  of three-verse sequences, they logically follow the four-verse hymns.  
In this particular hymn there is little evidence of unity either within tr̥cas or between  them: the standard topics of soma hymns—the details of preparation (e.g., vss. 4–5)  and the gods for whom he’s prepared (e.g., vss. 8–9), the cosmic connections of Soma  (e.g., vss. 10, 16, 18), and the largesse and aid we ask him for (e.g., vss. 3, 23–24)—  
are strung together in no apparent order. There is a discernible tendency, however, to  emphasize Soma’s role in combating hostile forces, either directly or by strengthening  someone else to do so, especially Indra. The hymn begins with two verses mention ing some of Indra’s exploits performed under the influence of Soma, though without  

naming Indra, and the theme of Soma the smiter and aggressive warrior returns  toward the end of the hymn and dominates the last two tr̥cas (vss. 19–20, 22, 24–30).
