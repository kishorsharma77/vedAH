I do not understand why Ge and Re render the juṣanta, to the common and well-understood medial stem juṣáte ‘enjoys’, as ‘grant’ (zibilligen) and ‘agree’ 48 respectively. Although it is true that the final vss. of hymns frequently ask gods for things, it is also true that we commend our praises to them -- and surely that’s what’s going on here: we want the gods to take pleasure in the hymn, or the ritual in general, that we have just offered them.
