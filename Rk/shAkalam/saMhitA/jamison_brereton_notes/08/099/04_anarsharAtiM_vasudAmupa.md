Ge renders the phrase aśastihā́janitā́as “der die Hohnreden niederschlägt und hervorruft”; that is, he construes the 1st compound member aśasti- also with janitā́, flg. Sāy’s gloss of janitā́as asurebhyo ‘śastīnāṃ janayitā, and also ascribes an aberrant meaning to √jan, ‘call out, evoke’. It is certainly true that the normal value of √jan, ‘beget’, seems somewhat out of place in this otherwise hostile context, but I am reluctant to push both the syntax and the semantics as far as Ge’s interpretation requires. I think rather that Indra’s general positive role as cosmic begetter is being alluded to, in addition to his specific role as all-victorious dominator. In fact, the paired verse in this pragātha may give us the clue. In 6ab Heaven and Earth (the underlying referents of the dual kṣoṇī́) run after Indra “like two parents after their child” (śíśuṃ ná mātárā), which reverses an image found elsewhere of Indra as the begetter of Heaven and Earth, as in VIII.36.4 janitā́divó janitā́pṛthivyā́ḥ. In other words, I think we should read janitā́in 5c pregnantly, as “begetter (of Heaven and Earth)” in opposition to 6ab, where Indra is the child and Heaven and Earth the parents. Alternatively, the pregnant usage might be “begetter (of all),” with viśvaborrowed from the first member of the following compound viśvatū́r. Watkins (Dragon, 345) roughly follows the Ge interpretation, though with more persuasive semantics: “you smash the un-song (for the loser) and engender (it for the winner)”; presumably the parenthetic “it” should be not the “un-song,” but its de-negated counterpart, śastí- ‘laud, praise’.

I tr. taruṣyant- as a pseudo-desiderative, contra Ge (Wettstreiter, sim. Gr).

The stem is a hapax, and its formation isn’t entirely clear. But the most orthodox way to explain it is as a denominative to tárus-, ‘power/desire to overcome’; since ‘seeking’ is a standard sense associated with -yá-denominatives, a desiderative sense is certainly possible.
