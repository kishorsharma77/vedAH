Old discusses who/what to supply with yujā́, suggesting first the bráhmanof 2c, but then opting with Gr (tr.) and Ge, for soma. See Ge “(mit Soma) im Bunde.” Old rejects the possibility that it is Indra, which is the solution I have adopted here. I do so because you=Indra is almost the default with yujā́throughout the RV. For exx.

in VIII see nearby VIII.21.11 tváyā … yujā́(where the referent of the 2nd ps. is Indra) and VIII.68.9 tvā́yujā́(ditto), etc., etc., and for the full noun I.23.9 índreṇa … yujā́, etc. I would in fact suggest that the poet is here making the enclitic tvā do double duty; it is the correct accusative goal with havāmahe, but it also evokes the accented older short instr. tvā́that as an independent word is limited to constructions with yujā́.
