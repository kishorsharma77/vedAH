Pāda b is nicely configured: víśvā veda jánimā jātávedāḥ. The first two and the last two words alliterate. The final word, the epithet jātávedas-, is immediately preceded by two independent words etymologically related to its two members (in reverse order): veda to -vedāḥ, jánimā to jātá-. (Of course, -vedas- may ultimately derive from √vid ‘find, possess’, but at least folk-etymologically it belongs with √vid ‘know’.) And víśvā veda evokes the cmpd viśvá-vedas-, a parallel formation to jātávedas-. Nothing profound here, but a pleasing way to deploy four words.
