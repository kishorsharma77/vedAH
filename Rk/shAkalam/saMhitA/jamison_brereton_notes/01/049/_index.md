Dawn On this hymn and, especially, on its “versified sandhi paradigm” (in JL’s felicitous phrase) and the aberrant voc. uṣar (4c), see Lundquist 2014. The appearance of this entirely anomalous form in the final verse of Praskaṇva’s Dawn ritual series (I.44-49) defines this series as a type of ring: uṣar- as an -ar locatival occurred in the first verse of the series (I.44.1) in the compound uṣar-budh- ‘waking at dawn’.

The hymn itself has a simple ring structure: bhadrébhiḥ in 1a (with which ‘rays’ is supplied on the basis of I.48.13) matches ráśmibhiḥ in 4a, rocanā́t in 1b matches rocanám in 4b, while the genitive diváḥ of 1b anticipated in 3d.
