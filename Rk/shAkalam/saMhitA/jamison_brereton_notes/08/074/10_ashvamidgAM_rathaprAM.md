The vs. is structured as an acc. phrase referring to Agni, with no governing verb. It is probably best to take it as loosely anticipating the rel. clauses beginning with yám in the other two verses of the tṛca (yáṃ tvā 11a, 12a). That the accusatives in ab, d belong in a virtual rel. clause is signalled by pāda c with a rel.

clause in the gen. (yásya …).

My interpr. of pāda a differs from the standard, which takes -prā́- as ‘fill’ and construes áśvam … gā́m as a simile: “filling the chariot [with goods, vel sim.] (as) a horse (or) cow (does).” This conjures up an unintentionally comic picture in a physical sense, and even in the attenuated sense this interpr. presumably sketches, that a winning horse or productive cow generates goods that would fill a chariot (see Ge’s n. 10a), the structure and meaning of the phrase are muddy. I follow a suggestion of Re’s, given in his n. to the passage but not reflected in his tr., that the sequence is a reduction of *aśvaprā́m íd goprā́ṃ rathaprā́m and that prā́- belongs with forms like pūrdhí ‘give!’ (Mayrhofer’s PARI2 ).

The u-present tū́rvatha here is enclosed by two occurrences of related (vṛtra- )tū́rya- (9c, 12c) ‘overcoming of obstacles’, but though tū́rva- does on occasion take an acc. of what is overcome (cf. the same VP in VIII.99.6 vṛtrám … tū́rvasi), here “overcome (Agni’s) claims to fame” is excluded by sense, since the poets shouldn’t seek to outdo Agni, and it must mean something like “help to triumph.” In pāda d I supply *gṛṇánti as the verb with nom. kṛṣtáyaḥ on the basis of the next hymn VIII.75.10 grṇ̥ ánti deva kr̥ṣṭáyaḥ (see also girā́in the next vs. of this hymn, 11a). It is possible that this subj./verb complex governs the whole verse, save for pāda c with its 2nd pl. verb and gen. rel. cl. -- thus, “(whom) the separate peoples (hymn) as the one bestowing the chariot …”
