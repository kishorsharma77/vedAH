Pādas de contain what we would call a mixed metaphor: “we would place you at our chariot-pole like a boat.” In a RVic context this does not seem a solecism, but simply an example of the usual piling of image upon image.

I am uncertain of the value of the part. citáyantaḥ in f. In keeping with the zero-grade root syllable it should mean ‘appear’ or ‘perceive’, but the case frame makes these interpr. hard to impose. In the publ. tr. I take it as a double I/T (in the term used in my 1983 book) ‘make (Indra) take notice’, that is, ‘cause to perceive’, but I am disturbed by the mismatch of the formal and the functional: in this meaning it should be full-grade cetáya- and there is no easy way to explain a redactional change to zero-grade. (Ge, Re tr. ‘auszeichnen’, ‘distinguent’ respectively, but this doesn’t conform to any standard meaning of citáya- or cetáya-. WG take it as an intrans., “wir glänzenden Nachkommen des Āyu,” which respects the formal shape but leaves the rest of the pāda without a syntactic skeleton.) Since it has the same value that I ascribe to īkṣáyat in the next hymn (I.132.5), it may be that citáyant- here adapted the sense of īkṣáya-, since they both have apparent zero-grade stems.

Another problem with this final sequence is the function and position of ná in f. It should mark índram as the compared term in a simile (“… like Indra”), but since Indra should be the target of sacrifice and praise, deflecting him to the simile is unlikely and leaves us without a corresponding term in the frame. I am loosely taking ná as having domain over the whole pāda, which implicitly compares us (the subject of dhīmahi in e) with the Āyus, though this is not how simile marking generally works -- and will also not work if “we” are identical to the Āyus rather than compared to them. The mention of the Āyus in the preceding hymn, I.130.6, and in
