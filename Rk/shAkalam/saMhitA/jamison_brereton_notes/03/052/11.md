This vs. is supposed to depict the Aśvamedha of King Sudās, and the releasing of the horse in b and the smiting of obstacles in all directions in c, followed by a sacrifice in d, certainly support this interpr.

cetáyadhvam is variously rendered, but most generally as ‘pay attention’ vel sim. I instead take this middle full-grade -áya-formation as a reflexive transitive “make yourselves known” based on the ‘make perceive’ sense of cetáya-. Re’s alternative “faites vous remarquer” is closest to mine.

As Watkins points out (Dragon, p. 208), although this form of the intens. of √han has a singular object (somewhat unusually), it is “serially plural,” in that the vṛtrám is located in one cardinal direction after another; see also Schaeffer 204-5.
