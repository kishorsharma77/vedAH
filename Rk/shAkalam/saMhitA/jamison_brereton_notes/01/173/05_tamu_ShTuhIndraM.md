In its contexts sátvan- clearly refers to a successful warrior, but it is of course a possessive -van-stem to the neut. pres. part. to √as ‘be’, whose participle, lit.

‘being’, often has the extended sense ‘actually being’ à ‘real’. I take the semantic dev. of sátvan- to be a slangy ‘having the real stuff’, ‘the real thing’. Cf. the similar Engl. expression “the right stuff,” the title of a novel by Tom Wolfe (and the movie based on it) about the astronauts in the space program. For another conjunction of śū́ra- and sánt- see 7a below.

Where to put maghávā is a minor question, since word order could support grouping it with śū́raḥ (Ge, WG), separating it from both śū́raḥ and ratheṣṭḥā́ḥ (Re), or grouping it with ratheṣṭhā́ḥ (me). What I am now certain of is that making maghávā the primary focus of the rel. cl., with ratheṣṭhā́ḥ an adjunct, as I do in the publ. tr. (“who is a benefactor, standing upon his chariot”), is wrong, since the parallel relative clauses name Indra in various combat roles. I would now change my tr. to “who is a bounteous chariot-fighter” or “who is a chariot-fighter, a benefactor.” The acc. pl. pf. part. vavavrúṣaḥ simply shows perseveration of the redupl.

syllable (so also Kü p. 456) for expected *va-vr-uṣ-. The additional reduplicating syllable may have been added because the root syllable is swallowed up in the weak stem of the participle.
