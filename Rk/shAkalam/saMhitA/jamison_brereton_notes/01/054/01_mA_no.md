The mā́prohibitive lacks a verb, and there is nothing nearby to supply. The universal solution, “leave, abandon,” does the trick, although it would be nice to have some support for it.

róruvad vánā is variously interpreted. I have taken vánā as extent-of-space, though construing it as a second object of ákrandayaḥ (WG) would also be possible, save for the fact that the same phrase recurs in 5b and WG must construe it with a different verb. There seems no reason to supply a separate verb to govern it, as Ge does: “(du knackest),” and taking vánā as agreeing with róruvat as Re does (“les arbres (ont) grincé-violemment”) introduces unnecessary grammatical complications.

(Is he thinking of this as a variant on neuter pl. + sg. verb?) For an expression similar to my suggested interpretation see váne … vacasyate “display his eloquence in the wood” in the next hymn (55.4).
