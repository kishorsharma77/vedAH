Nābhānediṣṭha Mānava  
11 verses: jagatī 1–4, anuṣṭubh 5, br̥hatī 6, satobr̥hatī 7, anuṣṭubh 8–9, gāyatrī 10,  triṣṭubh 11  
Attributed to the same poet as X.61, this hymn takes up some of the same themes  as the previous hymn, but in much more straightforward fashion. The Aṅgirases,  who figured in verses 10–13 of X.61, are the subject of the first seven verses of  this hymn, with blessings heaped upon them in verses 1–4. Their lineal descent  from Agni is clearly indicated here (vss. 5–6), while in X.61 it was present pri  
marily by implication (vss. 9–10). The Vala myth is treated in verses 2 and 7, and  in verse 3 the Aṅgirases are credited with cosmogonic deeds more appropriate  to Indra.  
The “navel” of X.61.18–19 is also encountered in verse 4 of this hymn (loc.  nā́bhā, pāda a). Although some (e.g., Geldner) consider the navel in that verse to  be a truncation of the (supposed) poet’s name Nābhānediṣṭha, we consider it to a  reference to the sacrificial ground or the ritual fire, as in X.61.19.  
The first four verses end with the refrain “Accept the descendant of Manu  (mānavá).” Geldner, who believes that the hymn conforms to the story told in  Aitareya Brāhmaṇa V.14 about Nābhānediṣṭha Mānava, considers this refrain to  be a self-reference by the poet and supplies “me” with mānavám as its appositive  (“accept me, the descendant of Manu”). But we follow Oldenberg in considering the Aitareya Brāhmaṇa story secondary and, like many Brāhmaṇa explanations of  R̥gvedic hymns, based on misunderstanding. Given that our poet’s patron is named  Manu (see vss. 8 and 11), it seems more likely that in this refrain the poet is com  
mending his patron and/or his family to the protection of the Aṅgirases. The final four verses (8–11) are a dānastuti of this patron, Manu Sāvarṇi, with  the final Aṅgiras verse (7) serving as a transition to this praise of magnanimity.
