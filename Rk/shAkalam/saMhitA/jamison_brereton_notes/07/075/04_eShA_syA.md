The initial eṣā́syā́“this very one” (fem.) matches eté tyé “these very ones” (masc.) opening the previous vs., referring to her beams.

As Old points out, pāda a lacks a syllable (even reading, as expected, s i yā́). He tentatively suggests *yuyujānā́. It is certainly the case that yujāná-, which is fairly common, never appears in this post-caesura position, while the four occurrences of yuyujāná- are all post-caesura. But it is difficult to explain why the corruption would have occurred -- perhaps haplology in the sequence (s i )yā́*yuyu(jānā́)? The “patterns of the peoples” (vayúnāni jánānām) seem almost to be the human equivalent of the daívyāni vratā́ni of 3c.

The pāda-final pres. jigāti picks up the aor. forms to the same root, also pādafinal, ā́gāt (1b), ā́guḥ (3b), but it also plays against the likewise redupl. ajīgaḥ at the end of 1d, belonging to the separate root √gṛ ‘awaken’.
