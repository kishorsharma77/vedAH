Śāryāta Mānava  
15 verses: jagatī  
A generally disorganized and often puzzling hymn, it nonetheless begins with three  well-turned verses to Agni, using some of the same lexicon and imagery as the pre ceding Agni hymn. This initial similarity may account for the placement of the hymn  
in the maṇḍala. Two Agni verses also close the hymn (14–15) in a ritual context. What lies between seems to lack structure and logical progression. Some verses  contain an odd assortment of divinities and semi-divinities (e.g., vss. 4–5, 11–13);  Rudra and/or the Maruts recur in several verses (5–6, 9). Fragments of familiar  myths appear without further development—for example, Indra’s interference with  the horses of the Sun in verse 8—and other verses contain apparent references to  other stories of which we know nothing (e.g., vs. 10). In short, despite some pleas ing passages, the hymn mostly yields frustration.
