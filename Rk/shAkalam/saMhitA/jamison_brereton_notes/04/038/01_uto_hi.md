Although the Anukramaṇī takes Heaven and Earth to be the deity of this vs., the unidentified duals must rather refer to Mitra and Varuṇa, as also in vs. 2. This is clear from IV.39, where Mitra and Varuṇa give Dadhikrā to the Purus (2cd, 5cd).

The publ. tr. doesn’t accurately reflect sánti in pāda a. The tr. should read “Since there are earlier gifts …” The form nitośé is much disputed. Gr identifies it as a 3rd sg. to the thematic pres. tośate (otherwise unaccented), but not only is there a perfectly fine -te 3rd sg.

(tośate 4x) while a t-less 3rd sg. would be anomalous, but given the full-grade we would expect root accent (*nitóśe). Old vacillates but displays a weak preference for a 3rd sg. unreduplicated perfect, and Ge, who does not comment, appears to follow him (“… ausgeschüttet hat”). Despite this scholarly pedigree, this solution appears to me to have little to recommend it: non-reduplicated perfects are quite rare. Gotō (1st Kl, 167-68) also vacillates: if it’s a verb it’s a non-redupl. pf. Or it might be the loc. of a noun nitośá-; this appears to be the view represented in WG. There does exist a them. noun tośá-. Re also tentatively suggests a locative but “à nuance semiinfinitive,” tr. “pour être déversées.” I find Re’s interpr. appealing, though, as often, somewhat cavalier about grammar. I would like to take the form directly as a dative root noun in infinitival usage, but we should probably expect *nituśé. It may have been adjusted to match the grade of tośá-, or the loc. ending -é of the them. noun may have been reinterpr. as a purpose dative. One might expect the hapax naitośá- to provide some help, but it is only found in the impenetrable Aśvin hymn X.106.6, which appears to be written in code. In any event, the point of the hemistich seems to be that Mitra and Varuṇa provided gifts to Trasadasyu, who then redistributed them to his subjects the Purus in an appropriately kingly way.
