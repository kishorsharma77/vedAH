As was implied in the publ. tr., there is more cohesion across tṛcas than within them. In this 1st vs. of the 2nd tṛca there are a number of connections to the previous one: the 1st word sákhāyaḥ recalls sákhā in 1c; in b the impv. prá … gāyata “sing forth” is a variant of the nominal form práśasti- (3b) to the lexeme prá √śaṃs ‘proclaim forth’; in c the nominal clause sá hí naḥ X resembles 1c … sá naḥ X; c contains another -ti-stem abstract, prámati-, like those in 3 (two of which are cmpded with prá-); and the final word of the vs., mahī́, echoes the 1st word of 3 mahī́ḥ.
