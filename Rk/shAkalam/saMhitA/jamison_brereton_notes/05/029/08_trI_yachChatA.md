Gr and Ge [/WG] take both ághaḥ and ápāḥ as 3rd sg. Since ághas belongs to the root pres. to √ghas, either 2nd or 3rd sg. is grammatically possible. But for ápāḥ to be 3rd sg., an s-aor. stem ápās- has to be posited, for which there is no other support save for a med. pāsta in a mā́-prohibitive in the AV (XII.3.43). Nevertheless, Narten does set up such a stem (Sig.Aor. 168). I see no reason to do so; the presence of nom. sg. maghávā, adduced as evidence by Narten, is not sufficient, since nom. sg.

appositives to 2nd sg. subjects are common. Also common is abrupt shifting between 2nd and 3rd ps., found already in this hymn between vss. 1 and 2, 4 and 5, 5 and 6. In our vs. we must assume that a shift happens between the hemistichs, given the 3rd sg.

jaghā́na in 8d, but this is hardly unprecedented -- and note that it returns abruptly to 2nd ps. in vs. 9. I therefore prefer to interpret 8ab as couched in the 2nd sg., as in the publ. tr. But if a 3rd sg. reading of ápāḥ is really desirable, I would prefer to consider the -s ending a local analogy to the precative peyāḥ at the end of 3b, reinforced by the ambig. parallel ághaḥ, rather than setting up an s-aorist stem to account for a single form.

I follow Ge in taking both kārám and bháram as the direct speech expression of a victory cry. The former is appropriate to gaming contexts, while the latter is at home in battles. Our ahvanta … bháram has a compositional equivalent bhára-hūti-, for which see comm. ad I.129.2; for kārám √kṛ, see I.131.5. It may be convenient to assemble here some passages containing both bhára- and kārá- (or derivatives): I.l12.1 yā́bhir [ūtíbhiḥ] bháre kārám áṃśāya jínvathaḥ; VIII.66.1 (likewise an Indra hymn): (índram ... ūtáye/ ....../) huvé bháram ná kāríṇam; IX.16.5 mahé bhárāya kāríṇaḥ; IX.14.1 kāráṃ bíbhrat puruspṛ́ham.
