For you has this soma been purified all around by the stones; clothing  himself in coveted (garments) he rushes around the cask—clothing  
himself in gleaming (garments) he rushes.  
For you is this portion poured among the Āyus, is the soma poured  among the gods.  
Travel, Vāyu; drive to our teams [=poetic thoughts], seeking us—drive at  your pleasure, seeking us.
