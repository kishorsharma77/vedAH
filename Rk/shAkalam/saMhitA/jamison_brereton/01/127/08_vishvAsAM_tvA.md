We invoke you, lord of all the clans, houselord common to every one  of them, for benefit—you with your trusty vehicle of songs, for  benefit—
the guest of the sons of Manu, by whose mouth, as if by a father’s, (we) and all the immortals yonder (acquire) vigor—(place) the
oblations and vigor among the gods.
