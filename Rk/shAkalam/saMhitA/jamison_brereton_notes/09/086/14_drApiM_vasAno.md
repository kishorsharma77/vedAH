I would now tr. the pf. part. jajñānáḥ with past value, “once having been born.” The standard tr. (and incl. Ober II.76; Lowe, Part. 158) take svár as nom. with the pf. part.: “having been born as the sun.” This is of course quite possible. But I would expect a goal with abhí √kram and therefore take svàr as acc. in that function (see also Scar 330).

I take nábhasā as instr. of extent of space, rather than accompaniment (Ge, Lowe) or, even less likely, agent (Re “s’est élancé par la nuée,” despite the absence of any verbal form that could be interpr. as passive).

The identify of the “age-old father” isn’t clear, and various candidates have been suggested: Sāy.: Indra; Ge (n. 14d): Parjanya or Heaven; Re: Heaven. I’m generally inclined towards Heaven, though of course bringing Heaven here is not physcially possible.
