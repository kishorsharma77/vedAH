For the imagery here, see the publ. intro.

The sequence páry ā́va ā́gur with doubled preverb is curious. Ge provides numerous parallels in his n. 4a, but none like this, with the two preverbs separated only by an enclitic pronoun and contained within a preverb (pári) - verb sequence. I have no explanation for this, though I would note that of the 8 occurrences of supposed aguḥ / águḥ, 7 are pāda-final and are univerbated with the preverb ā́, as ā́guḥ.

The hapax vārkār i yā́m is of course very obscure. Ge simply takes it as an unanalyzable name of the “Sangeskunst” of the Gotamas. However, it is clearly a compound and the compound members are easily identified: vār- ‘water’ and √kṛ ‘make’, and so it should be susceptible to meaningful analysis. As indicated in the publ. intro. I believe that it has the same underlying referent as anubhartrī́in 6a, namely the musical instrument, in my view the vīṇā, and that the poet was playing with the paradox that the instrument is grammatically feminine but in some forms looks remarkably like male genitalia. I therefore follow Gr’s gloss ‘Wasser … schaffend’ and assume that it refers to the penis. The problem is what kind of formation it is, and how to get an agentive-like meaning out of kār i yā́-. First, note that the formation does not have gerundive accent and is therefore not a conventional sgerundive despite the vṛddhi in the root and the shape of the suffix. Formally it is most likely a verbal abstract ‘water-making, Wasserbeschaffung’, as Old takes it (so also AiG II.2.832 following Old). However, because it was a feminine abstract, I think that it was secondarily available to be identified with the underlying feminine referent, the vīṇā, and animatized as a quasi-agent.

Note the phonological play between vārkār- (b) and arkaír (c).
