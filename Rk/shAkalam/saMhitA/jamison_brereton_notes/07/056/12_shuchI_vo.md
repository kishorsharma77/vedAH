The metrical boundary, however fuzzy, between the DV and Triṣṭubh sections separates the first part of the hymn from the more ritually focused one 83 beginning here. The expression hinomy adhvarám “I set the ceremony in motion” announces the inauguration of the sacrifice.

This vs. harps, rather tediously, on the adj. śúci- ‘gleaming’, which occurs 6x, twice each in pādas a, b, and d.

Pāda c contrasts ṛtá- in ṛténa … ṛta-sā́paḥ with satyá-, the latter as goal of √i ‘go, come’. In my view, satyám … āyan refers to the truth-serving Maruts’ epiphany on the ritual ground: they “came to reality” for the sacrificers, that is, they became really present. This epiphany is effected “by truth”: the operation of the properly performed ritual mechanism.
