I take yádi in pāda a as standing for *yád ī, with shortening before the cluster pr. See Jamison 2002. Hence ‘when’, not ‘if’. The *ī as usual functions as an accusative, anticipating the obj. sahásram mahiṣā́n.

The word play between the voc. pravṛddha in a and the refrain verb prá vāvṛdhe cannot be easily captured in English.
