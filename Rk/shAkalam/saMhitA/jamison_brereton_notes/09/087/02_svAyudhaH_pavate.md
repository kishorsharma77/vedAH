This vs. contains two links to the preceding hymn, despite their difference in meter: most of pāda c pitā́devā́nāṃ janitā́… is identical to IX.86.10b, with each closing with a word that conforms to its cadential template; the first two words of d, viṣṭambhó divó, are identical to IX.86.35d divó viṣṭambháḥ, but in opposite order, with minimal metrical difference. (Our pāda is repeated in IX.89.6, while the order in 86.35 is repeated in IX.108.16.)
