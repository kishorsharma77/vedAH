I separate pādas a and b and supply a verb of extension with b. Most tr. take ádṛśram as the main verb of the whole verse. Although my interpretation requires more machinery, it takes account of the fact that ví is vanishingly rare with the root √dṛś (though it must be admitted that there’s an example in the nearby Praskaṇva hymn I.46.11), while it is common with roots like √tan ‘stretch’, which also appears regularly with raśmí-. Cf. X.129.5 vítato raśmíḥ. However, the standard tr. is certainly possible. ET also suggests that since ví is fairly common with √bhrāj, that might be the verb to understand with bc: “… his rays flashing widely through the peoples like fires.” Of course, ordinarily participles with preverbs are univerbated, but not always.
