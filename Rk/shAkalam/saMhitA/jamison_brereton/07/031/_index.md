Indra  
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi  
12 verses: gāyatrī 1–9, virāj 10–12, arranged in trcas. ̥  
This twelve-verse hymn is organized into tr̥cas, the first three (1–9) in dimeter meter,  the last in trimeter, but the hymn seems conceived as a unity. It begins with the  poet’s address to his priestly comrades (vs. 1), followed by his self-address (vs. 2a),  and the joint production of his comrades and himself is referred to in the 1st plural  in 2bc. The last tr̥ca likewise begins with an address to the priests by the poet (vs.  10). At regular intervals throughout the hymn the poet and his fellow celebrants are  compared to the Maruts, who likewise hymned Indra (vss. 2, 8, 12).  
The praise of Indra and the benefits we request of him are generic, but nicely balanced.
