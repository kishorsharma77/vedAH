Ge refuses to tr. dáṃsujūta-. Re “ayant été mû (comme) par miracle,” clearly connecting it with dáṃsas- ‘wondrous power’, etc.; my tr. makes the same connection. The stem dáṃsu- is probably also found in dáṃsu-patni- (IV.19.7), though this is disputed. WG tr. dáṃsujūta- “als Heimkehrer,” with the 1st member the loc. pl. of dám- ‘house’ -- so, more literally, ‘in die Häuser eilend’. This is clever, and the two independent uses of dáṃsu, both nearby (I.134.4, 141.4), do seem to be that loc. pl. However, jūta- means ‘sped, spurred on’ and the fairly numerous compds in which it occurs have a 1st member that provides impetus (cf., e.g., vā́tajūta- ‘wind-sped’); ‘sped into the house’ sounds more like an act of cowardice or retreat than of triumph.

bāḷhasṛ́tvā in c is even more problematic (though Ge does tr. it: “geht er [yāti] festes Ganges”). Independent sṛ̥́tvan- means ‘running, streaming’; bāḷha- means ‘thick, squeezed’, to √baṃh. Although it would of course be possible to attenuate that meaning to ‘firm, powerful’, I think that Kakṣīvant, by using this unusual compound, and esp. the unusual 1st member, had something more precise in mind than a firm stride -- esp. in a dānastuti, where slang is most at home. I have therefore used the Engl. idiom ‘pumped up’ (approximating the ‘squeezed, dense’ sense of the Skt.), which is defined by an online dict. (http://www.thefreedictionary.com) as “tense with excitement and enthusiasm as from a rush of adrenaline,” with the following example: "we were really pumped up for the race."
