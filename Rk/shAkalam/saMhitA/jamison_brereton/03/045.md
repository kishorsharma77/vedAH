Indra
Viśvāmitra Gāthina
5 verses: br̥hatī
The hymn begins by inviting Indra to “drive here,” as is familiar from the previous  “journey” hymns in this Indra cycle (e.g., III.41, 42, 43), but it soon turns to a series  of striking and elaborate similes and metaphorical identifications glorifying Indra  and his gifts. The middle verse (3) contains four separate similes and so, as often,  represents the concentrated essence of the hymn.
## 1
Drive here, Indra, with your gladdening fallow bays, whose hair is (like)  peacocks’.
Let no one hold you down, as men using snares do a bird. Go across  them, as if across wasteland.
## 2
Gnawer of Vr̥tra, breaker of Vala, splitter of strongholds, driver of  waters,
mounter of the chariot, caller of the two fallow bays—Indra is the one  who breaks apart even the fastnesses.
## 3
Your resolve, deep like pools—you foster it, like cows.
As milk-cows with a good herdsman reach pasturage, as brooks reach a  lake, (so your resolves) have reached fulfillment.
## 4
Bring here to us thrusting wealth, like a share to the one who
acknowledges it.
As a man with a crook shakes a tree for ripe fruit, o Indra, shake (us)  goods that will get (us) across.
530 III.46–47
## 5
Self-seeking, you are self-ruling, and, along with (the gifts you) allot,  exceptionally self-glorious, o Indra.
Having increased in strength, much-praised one, become the one who  most receives our praises.
