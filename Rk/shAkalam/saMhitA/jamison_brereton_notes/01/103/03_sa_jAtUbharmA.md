The iconic splitting of verb and preverb in 2c is complemented here in b by the polarized positioning of the NP “Dāsa strongholds,” the object of vibhindán, at the beginning and end of the pāda: #púraḥ … dā́sīḥ#, while the preverb+verb are univerbated in the participle (as against 2c).

Ge (/WG) take śraddádhāna ójaḥ as transitive-reflexive, “trusting in his own power,” but as Old argues, śrád √dhā, a signature word of this set of hymns, expresses the trust that people have in Indra, and the medial participle should therefore be taken as a passive (so also Re). For the other occurrences of śrád √dhā that support this interpr., see vs. 5 in this hymn (structurally paired with 3; see publ.

intro.), as well as I.102.2, 104.6-7.
