In the publ. tr. prathamám in the phrase té manvata prathamáṃ nā́ma is rendered as an adj. with nā́ma (“the first name”). On the basis of VI.1.a tvám … prathamó manótā “you (were) the first minder” I think it possible (but not certain) that prathamám here is an adverb: “they first brought to mind the name …” The agent noun manótar- is built to the verb stem manu- found in our passage, and prathamám may qualify the action of ‘bringing to mind’ rather than the name brought to mind.

A comma should be inserted in the publ. tr. after “(The cows)” in pāda c.

On vrā́- see comm. ad VIII.2.16 and Jamison 2003 (= “Vedic vrā́: evidence for the svayaṃvara in the Rig Veda?” in Paitimāna: Essays in Iranian, IndoEuropean, and Indian Studies in Honor of Hanns-Peter Schmidt, vols. 1-2 [ed.

Siamak Adhami], 2003, pp. 39-56).

Because of its accentuation yaśásā should be adjectival; the question is what head noun to supply. Flg. Lü (Varuṇa, 521, also fld. by Hoffmann, WG), I supply ‘name’, which appears in pāda a and appears to be the topic of the rest of the vs. Ge and Old prefer ‘milk’, but this is contextually less likely.
