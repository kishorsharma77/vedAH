Ge takes gómatīṣu as referring to a particular river basin and WG to “cowrich (rivers)” -- the latter apparently flg. Gr’s “rinderreicher Ort.” But the mention of Indra’s companion Vāyu here points to a ritual, not battlefield, victory, specifically the morning pressing when Indra and Vāyu receive the first oblations. There are two nouns that are regularly modified by gómati- in the fem. pl.: ‘dawns’ (uṣā́saḥ) and ‘refreshments’ (íṣaḥ). Either of them would work in this context. The publ. tr.

supplies the latter, functioning as a loc. absol.: “when (refreshments) consisting of cows [that is, milk and butter] are at stake.” íṣ- does not have an attested loc. pl., and if it did, it would not be pretty or easily recognized: *ikṣú? iṭṣú? It would therefore not be surprising if such a form were gapped, with the final of the adj. (-īṣu) gesturing towards it phonologically. However, it is also possible that “at the cow-rich dawns” is meant, given that the ritual in question happens at that time. uṣás- also lacks an attested loc. pl., though we should probably expect *uṣátsu (see my 1991 “Ox, Cart,” 90-91). Again, gapping this awkward form would not be surprising.
