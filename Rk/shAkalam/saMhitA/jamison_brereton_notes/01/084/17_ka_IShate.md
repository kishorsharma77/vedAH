Contra the interpretation of íbha- as ‘elephant’ in Vedic (so Ge), see EWA s.v. ### 18
yajātai is, as far as I can tell, the only RVic examples of a medial 3rd sg.

subjunctive in -tai, the form that takes over beginning with the AV, spreading from the 1st sg. As such it may be a sign that at least this part of this last hymn in the Indra group is late.

Pāda c presents a problem that has been glossed over by most modern tr.: the active of ā́√vah should take an acc. of what is being conveyed, but it is distinctly odd to say that the gods are bringing the oblation here. Ge (Re, WG) avoid the difficulty by interpreting the verb as intrans. ‘fahren’ (/‘arriver-en-char’), a usage associated with the middle, with hóma an acc. of goal. Old, however, disapproves of this makeshift (as do I), setting out the arguments very clearly. Though he agrees that “der Gedanke befremdet,” he sticks to the expected syntax (as do I) and cites a number of passages in which gods do bring oblations. The closest is V.41.7 in which Night and Dawn bring the sacrifice to the mortal (V.41.7d ā́hā vahato mártyāya yajñám). I suggest that the role-switch in this verse (gods bring the oblation, rather than coming to our oblation to take it away) is also found in the next verse, where the god praises the mortal.
