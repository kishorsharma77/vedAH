The adj. aśúṣa- almost always occurs with śúṣṇa- (6 of its 7 occurrences: II.14.5, 19.6; IV.16.2; VI.20.4, 31.3, and here) and is a textbook example of a phonological figure. It is generally taken as a derivative of √aś i ‘eat’, meaning ‘gefrässig’ (standard tr., as well as Gr, AiG II.2.491, EWA s.v. aś i ) -- hence my ‘insatiable’, which is meant to produce a similar phonetic figure. I do wonder, though, if it’s not a derivative of √śvas ‘snort, pant’, which would make it also an etymological figure with śúṣṇa-, used proleptically to mean “(wrenched him down) (to become) breathless.” The phrase is almost always the object of a verb of violence, as here, and the proleptic adjective fits these contexts. For similar accent on a negated -a-stem compound, cf. akṣára- ‘imperishable’, ajára- ‘unaging’, adábha- ‘undeceptive’. Vs. 5c has a similar proleptic phrase, dásyūm̐r ádharān “(brought) the Dasyus low.”
