yác cid dhí vām purā́… is very like (nahí ṣma) yád dha vaḥ purā́in the immediately preceding hymn (VIII.7.21), which, with a present tense verb, expresses habitual action in the past. Here we have instead the med. 3rd pl. perfect juhūre (found otherwise only in almost identical context in I.48.14; see Kü 606), also apparently expressing habitual past action. (Delbrück [AiS 501-3] does not comment on this usage.) In both cases (also I.48.14) that action is implicitly compared to what is happening in the present. Here my praise is contrasted with those of the seers of the past.

VIII.8.11, 14-15: The bahuvrīhi sahásranirṇij- ‘having thousandfold raiment’ is found only in this hymn and does not seem a particularly natural qualifier either of a chariot (vss. 11, 14) or of refreshment (15).
