I take ab as a parallel and paraphrase of 2c, with Agni/the thunder cloud leading (náyan) the lightning flashes, while himself swollen with rain. Others supply different objects, and a radical (and in my view misguided) view of the passage makes náyan a 3rd pl. finite verb with Agni as its object - quite awkward because he is in the nominative in pāda a (píyānaḥ). Those who hold that view resolve the syntactic problem in ad hoc ways, by emendation (*píyānaṃ Old [SBE], subsequently rejected in Noten) or by taking ṛtásya páyasā píyānaḥ as a parenthetical (Re).

It is unclear whether párijmā is meant as an epithet of Varuṇa or a separate entity. Arguments can be made either way: in VII.40.6 the adjective qualifies wind and is associated with rain, and having Wind (Vāta) involved in this thunderstorm context would be understandable. On the other hand, a fourth god would break up the unity of the standard Āditya triad. The same pāda is found in X.93.4, but in the context of a longer list of gods.

Ge, Re take the “skin” as that of the earth, but I think it is rather the clouds in the lower atmosphere. So, more or less, Old (SBE) and WG. Cf. nearby I.62.5 (attributed to a Gautama) divó rája úparam astabhāyaḥ “you propped up the nearer realm of heaven.”
