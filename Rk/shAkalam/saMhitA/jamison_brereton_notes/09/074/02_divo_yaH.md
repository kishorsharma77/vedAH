The soma plant as pillar connecting heaven and earth and filling the midspace (ab) gives way to the plant as sacrificer (c)—an abrupt conceptual transition somewhat jarring to modern sensibilities.

In b Re supplies both the world and the filter as complement to paryéti. This seems reasonable, though the verb would have slightly different senses: “encompass (the world)” / “circle around (the filter).” I would now favor making this explicit in the tr.

The standard tr. take ā́vṛ́tā as instr., with a variety of interpr.: Ge “nach dem Herkommen” (sim. Scar 509), Re “par le processus-rituel” (sim. Maurer), Doniger “by tradition.” I take it rather as a fem. du. modifying ródasī (so Gr Nachtr.).

Pāda d contains the only ex. of sám √dhṛ in the RV (and one of the few in Vedic). I would now be inclined to give it a more literal tr.: “the poet holds together …” The poet in this case is of course Soma.
