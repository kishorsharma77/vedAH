title = "25"

This verse both parrots the preceding verse (24ab … puruṣṭutȧm, … ūtíbhiḥ / 25ab … puruṣṭuta, … ūtíbhiḥ) and concentrates into a single expression the reciprocal aid between god and praiser that has dominated the rhetoric of the last tṛcas. In the command vardhasva … ūtíbhiḥ “become increased … by forms of help,” the instr. should express the means by which Indra becomes strong, and that should be the help given him by others, as in vs. 17 tám íd víprāḥ … ūtíbhiḥ / … avardhayan… “The inspired poets increased him with helps.” But the forms of help in 25 are ṛ́ṣistutābhiḥ ‘praised by the seers’, which suggests that these are forms of help given by Indra to us, like those in 24b. The condensed expression in this verse sets up a closed circle, a never-ending loop, in which forms of help given and received are identical and have identical results. With that established, the poet then presses his advantage and in pāda c and in 26a puts Indra squarely in the role of helping us.
