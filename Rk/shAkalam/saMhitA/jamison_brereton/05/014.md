Agni
Sutambhara Ātreya
6 verses: gāyatrī
As in his previous two hymns Sutambhara emphasizes the power of the praise song  to awaken Agni. Here he fronts the name of Agni (vss. 1, 4–6) or a pronoun referring  to Agni (vss. 2, 3) in every verse. Verses 2–3 are not so much exceptions as a variation  of the structure of the other verses. These two verses form a single statement that  withholds the name “Agni” until it is fronted in their last pāda, 3c. Then verse 4 and  the following verses pick up “Agni” and continue with it as the first word in the verse.
## 1
Agni—awaken him with a praise song, kindling the immortal one. He will place our oblations among the gods.
## 2
Him they invoke in the rites—mortals (invoke) the immortal one,  the god—
to be the best sacrificer among the people of Manu,
## 3
Because him do they invoke one after another with a spoon dripping  with ghee, him the god
Agni, to convey the oblation.
## 4
Agni shone as soon as he was born, smashing Dasyus and darkness with  his light.
He found the cows, the waters, and the sun.
## 5
Agni, to be invoked as our poet—serve him, ghee-backed!
Let him—he will hear!—track my summons.
## 6
Agni, governing all territories, have they increased with ghee and  praise songs
of good insight and eloquence.
