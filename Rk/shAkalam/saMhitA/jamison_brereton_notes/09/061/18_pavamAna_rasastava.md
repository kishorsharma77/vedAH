I am, reluctantly, taking dákṣa- as an adj. here (as in IX.62.4), with Ge and Re, though it is generally a masc. noun. Alternatively a noun interpr. is possible (cf. Ober I.457 “dein Saft ist Fähigkeit”): “your sap shines forth brilliant as skill” or “… shines as brilliant skill,” though I still prefer the adjectival interpr. See Re’s disc.

Scar (237) takes ví rājati as ‘rules’ (“dein Saft herrscht weithin als König …” A pun is certainly possible here, but the insistent light imagery (dyumā́n in b and the whole c pāda) suggests that the ‘shine’ sense is the dominant one.

In c Ge takes víśvam as the modifier of jyótiḥ (“… ist alles licht”); so also Scar (237).

This is certainly possible, and jyótir vaiśvānarám in 16c might support it. But “for everyone / all to see the sun” is a locution encountered elsewhere (I.15.1, 5, VIII.49.8, X.136.1), incl.

nearby IX.48.4. My interpr. is shared with Re and Ober (I.457).
