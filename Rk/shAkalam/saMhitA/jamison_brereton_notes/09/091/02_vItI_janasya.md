The main clause of this vs., pādas ab, contains a predicated aor. part., svānáḥ, while the rel. cl., pādas cd, may contain a predicated intens. part., marmṛjānáḥ. However, given the prá opening c, it’s quite possible that we should supply a verb of motion “(go) forth” as the main verb, with the part. simply a modifier (“the drop [goes] forth, being groomed …”). Howvever, I prefer the publ.

tr., which does supply ‘go’ but as an oblique expression of purpose. Alternatively prá may actually belong with the part. marmṛjānáḥ, as Gr takes it - though there’s only one other possible ex. of prá √mṛj that I know of, at X.96.9.
