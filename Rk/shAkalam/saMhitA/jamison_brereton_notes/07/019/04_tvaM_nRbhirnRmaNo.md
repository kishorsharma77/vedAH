This verse puts into analytic (that is, syntactically independent) form some expressions met as compounds in the previous verse. Most obvious is (bhū́rīṇi) vṛtrā́ … haṃsi, which realizes vṛtrahátyeṣu in 3d. (Notice that both refer to plural events, handling their grammatical plurality in different ways.) A real dásyu- is destroyed in 4cd, plucked from the name Trasadasyu in 3c. In a slightly different relationship, devávītau ‘in pursuit of the gods’ here contains a form of the root √vī ‘pursue’ found as 1st compound member in vītahavyam ‘whose oblation is worth pursuing’ in 3a.

And within this verse nṛ́bhiḥ doubles the first member of the next word, nṛmano.
