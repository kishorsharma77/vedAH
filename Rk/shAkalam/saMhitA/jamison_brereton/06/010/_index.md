Agni  
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya  
7 verses: triṣṭubh, except dvipadā virāj 7  
The sentiments in this hymn are familiar ones: Agni as ritual fire being kindled  at the sacrifice, blazing brightly, receiving praise, and bestowing blessings on the  poet and his patrons. It is characterized, however, by a subtle strain of deliber ately misleading expectations (in part necessarily obscured by translation). On  several occasions the audience would automatically assign a referent on the basis  of formulaics and context only to discover later in the verse that the assumed  reference is wrong. In translation this is most easily seen in verse 3, where the first  phrase appears to describe Agni, but it turns out to be instead the poet serving  Agni. The beginning of verse 2 belongs to a formula found in a number of places  in the R̥gveda that imposes an identification of Agni on the opening demonstra  
tive “that.” It is only in the second half of the verse that it becomes clear that  the demonstrative instead modifies “praise.” The extreme ellipsis of verse 2 con tributes to this game of disappointed expectations: two objects in that verse lack  overt verbs to govern them.
