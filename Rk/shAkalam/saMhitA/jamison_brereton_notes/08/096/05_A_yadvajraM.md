The verbal counterpart to 2nd sg. dhatsé in the relative cl. (ab) is augmented ánavanta in the main clause (cd). I would therefore prefer to take dhatsé as a medial, preterital perfect, rather than as a present. Gr and Lu identify it as present, Ge translates it as one, and Kü (p. 275) explicitly claims that -i-liaison forms belong to the perfect, while those without the -i- are presents. Nonetheless, I think we can interpret dhatsé, the only such 2nd sg., as a perfect, next to very common dadhiṣé, esp. as only this form would fit in a Triṣṭubh cadence.

The accent on main-clause ánavanta must result from its membership in the repeated prá subclauses.

I take the formulators in d as the Maruts; Ge suggests either Aṅgirases or Maruts. Since the next tṛca (vss. 7-9) clearly contains the 1st ps. speech of the Maruts, and the next verse (6) has 1st ps. speech that can reasonably attributed to the Maruts, their introduction here would not be surprising.
