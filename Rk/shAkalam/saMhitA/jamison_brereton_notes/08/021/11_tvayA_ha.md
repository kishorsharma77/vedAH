The image in this verse is of a contest for cattle, where a competitor challenges us (ancient trash talk) and we can successfully respond, thanks to having Indra as our ally. The word qualifying the competitor, śvasánt- ‘snorting’, calls to mind Indra’s enemy Śuṣṇa (on the etymological connection see EWA s.v. śúṣṇa-) and therefore makes our human competition sound more formidable.
