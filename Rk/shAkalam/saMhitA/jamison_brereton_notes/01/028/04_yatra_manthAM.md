The word mánthā- occurs only here in the RV; it clearly refers to the churning stick later known as mantha or cāt(t)ra-, which is bound around with cords that, manipulated by a priest, move it rapidly back and forth while its bottom tip is inserted in the hole (yoni) of the lower kindling stick (aráṇi-) to create the friction that produces fire. The cords here are obviously likened to reins. For equine imagery in this context and for further disc. of the process, see comm. ad X.27.14.

Here there is a bit of slippage between frame and simile (as Ge also notes, n.

4a): though acc., the reins (raśmī́n) should not be directly compared to the churning stick, also acc. (manthā́m), and we might rather expect instr. *raśmíbhiḥ. However, it’s quite possible that raśmī́n is actually dependent on yámitavaí and is not directly parallel to manthā́m. So perhaps “when they bind the churning stick, as if to control the reins” (vel sim.); for other passages in which raśmī́n is obj. of √yam see I.144.11, VIII.35.21.

What is somewhat puzzling is what the reference to the churning stick is doing in this hymn focused on the preparation of soma, since the implement and the process are characteristic of the production of the ritual fire. Either kindling the ritual fire is considered part of the soma preparation here, or, more likely, the pestle used to pound the soma stalks has been homologized to the churning stick, in great part because of the highly sexualized nature of that implement in the fire-kindling ritual (see comm. ad X.27.14).

The inf. yámitavaí here is one of the few not appearing in the configuration - tavā́u, on which see Klein, Particle u, 164-67. Inter alia, the substitution of iva for

*u gives the desired iambic cadence.
