In an unpubl. paper Arlo Griffiths argues that armaká- means ‘mudflat’.

Note the -ka- forms, vailasthānaká- and armaká- (2x) -- pleonastic -ka- often being a sign of colloquial register (see Jamison, -ka-). Since diminutivization (or diminishment/belittling) is one of the apparent nuances of the -ka-suffix, it is somewhat amusing that we find “diminutivized” vailasthānaké beside mahā́vailasthe.
