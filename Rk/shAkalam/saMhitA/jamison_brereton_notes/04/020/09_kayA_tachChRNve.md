Pāda a is a definitional one, with the precise type of ability (śácī-) possessed by Indra giving him the designation ‘most able’ (śáciṣṭha).

Ge interprets múhu kā́cid as haplology for *muhukā́kā́cid (so also EWA s.v. múhur, WG, and, somewhat differently, Old flg. Ludwig). Cf. nearby IV.16.17 kásmiñ cid … muhuké (also muhukaíḥ IV.17.12). I have come, somewhat reluctantly, to the conclusion that this is correct. However, as noted in disc. ad IV.16.17, I do not accept Ge’s rendering of muhuká- as ‘Schlachtgeschrei’, which produces for this passage “… jedwedes Schlachtgeschrei hervorruft.” WG’s “… welches plötzlichen Vorfälle auch immer erledigt” is, however, more plausible. In IV.16.17 I suggest a sense ‘skirmish’, which works contextually there, but is here, I think, too specific. In fact, the published tr., “does everything instantly,” can stand, for a literal Engl. “does every instantaneous thing.” The lexeme ví √ci means literally ‘pull apart’; an exactly parallel usage to this one appears in VI.67.8 yuváṃ dāśúṣe ví cayiṣṭam áṃhaḥ (also cited by Ge), and the notion of pulling apart / opening up a narrow place (áṃhaḥ) is very apposite. It should also be noted, however, that the same lexeme is used in gambling contexts, indeed in the very X.42.9 just cited for prahā́vant- in 8c. In gambling it means ‘pile apart, pull out (a good hand)’. Although I don’t think that that idiomatic sense is reflected here, I do think that the gambling overtones would resonate with the other gambling vocabulary in this hymn.
