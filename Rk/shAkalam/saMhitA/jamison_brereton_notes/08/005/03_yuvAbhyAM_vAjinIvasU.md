The Pp. analyses the sequence yáthohiṣe as yáthā ohiṣe, which would be, to say the least, unusual sandhi (though see tásyéhi in VIII.3.12). Nonetheless, the context favors a connection with the root √ūh ‘solemnly proclaim, etc.’ with pres.

óha- (in my opinion); cf. I.30.4 vácas tád ... ohase “I solemnly proclaim this speech,” with a 1st sg. -se form, as apparently also here. For this passage I assume a form ūhiṣe, built to the presential perf. ūhé. This is also Kü’s solution (488-89), though he assigns the form to √vāh ‘anerkennen’, which, acdg. to him, is at least synchronically separate from √oh. Re and Lub. assign the form instead to √vah ‘convey’. For further disc. cf. Old and Ge (n. 3c).
