In the publ. tr. “with a rich prize” is slightly misleading, since it represents only vā́jena, but “prize-giver with a prize” sounded flat.

“Young woman from of old” (purāṇī́… yuvatíḥ) reflects the usual paradox that Dawn is both new every day and the same every day from the beginning of time.

She is “Plenitude” (púraṃdhiḥ) because she distributes the priestly gifts at the dawn sacrifice.
