Indra
Śāsa Bhāradvāja
5 verses: anuṣṭubh
The martial Indra, the “commander,” is called upon here to destroy our various  enemies. A  surprising amount of attention is given to “the scornful” (vss. 2–4).  Although verbal abuse may not seem to modern mentalities to pose the same sort of threat as more physical assaults, the ancient Indian belief in the power of speech  to inflict real harm is on view here. At issue may also be ritualized exchanges of  insults before battle.
## 1
As commander, you are great in just this way: as the infallible devourer  of foes,
whose comrade is not slain nor is he ever conquered.
## 2
As the lord of the clan who gives well-being, the Vr̥tra-smasher,
(smasher) of the scornful, exerting his will—
let the bull Indra go before us, the soma-drinker, the creator of
fearlessness.
## 3
Smash away the demon, away the scornful; break apart the jaws of Vr̥tra. O Indra, Vr̥tra-smasher, (smash) away the battle fury of the foe who  assails us.
## 4
Smash away the scornful for us, Indra. Hold down those who battle us. Who assails us, make him go to lower darkness.
## 5
Away with the thought of him who hates (us), Indra; away with the  deadly weapon of the one who seeks to despoil (us).
Extend shelter (to us) from battle fury. Keep the deadly weapon a wide  way away.
