Ge and Re take the rel. cl. of ab as unconnected with the rest of the vs. But surely the yásya refers to Indra, as is made clear by the ‘Vṛtra-smashing’ references in de.

The adj. vṛtrahám, twice modifying neut. śávaḥ (d, e), is attributed to a hapax thematic stem vṛtra-há- by Gr (see also Re’s comm.), beside the very well-attested root noun cmpd. vṛtra-hán-. Although this analysis must be synchronically correct, I wonder if the form here has not been re-marked from the expected neut. to the root noun, which should probably be *vṛtra-há. However, MLW suggests that the neut.

could have been simply the sten form *vṛtrahán, which could be misheard as vṛtrahám. See also disc. of satrā-hám ad V.35.4 and also of anarvám ad I.185.3. The re-marking must already have happened and the thematic stem extracted before the composition of this passage, since the -am ending makes position in the cadence.
