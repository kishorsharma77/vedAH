kathā́can be read thus or as kathā́ā́, with the same preverb as in the univerbated āyayá in the rel. cl. of 1b. The Pp. does not read the preverb. It is possible that the variation between kathám in the first question of the pāda and kathā́ is meant to enable the preverb reading, and the publ. tr. reflects that.

With Ge and Re I assume a gapped kvà in c and in 3a. WG simply take them as questions without an explicit interrogative (“Ist ein Sattel auf einem Rücken …?” etc.). The difference is unimportant rhetorically.
