Flg. a suggestion by Ge (n. 3a, though not reflected in his tr.), I take eṣáin pāda a (also 4a) as belonging to the stem eṣá- ‘quick’, which is used several times of Viṣṇu in the gen. expression víṣṇor eṣásya (II.34.11, VII.40.5, VIII.20.3), in which confusion with the nom. pronominal eṣá(ḥ) (possible here) is excluded.

The hapax śatárcas- is problematic. The Pp analyses the 2nd member as arcasam, but Wackernagel (AiG I.318) points out that the sandhi between the cmpd members would require rather -ṛcasam. However, Old disputes this, claiming that it would then have to be written (“… geschrieben werden müssen”) *śatáṛcasam , though it’s not clear to me why. Interpr. differ significantly: Sāy. glosses with arcis-.

Old posits a masc. s-stem *arcás- ‘singer’, comparing VI.34.3 yádi stotā́raḥ śatáṃ yát sahásraṃ gṛṇánti “When a hundred, when a thousand praisers sing to him …,” an interpr. followed by Ge -- though the connection between the two passages seems tenuous to me. By contrast, Re tr. “au cent éclats,” perhaps flg. Sāy.’s arcís-. Since an infinitival dat. ṛcáse ‘to praise, for chanting (praise)’ is found in VI.39.5 and VII.61.6, it seems reasonable to take the underlying stem ṛcas- as the base here, as Gr does, glossing ‘hundertfach zu preisen’. My ‘worth a hundred verses’ is close to that, though perhaps ‘praises, chants’ would be better.

Because of the lack of accent on asya, it should be pronominal, not adjectival; I would adjust the tr. to “of him, the stalwart.”
