Viṣṇu
Dīrghatamas Aucathya
6 verses: triṣṭubh
One of the only hymns dedicated entirely to Viṣṇu, this composition reads almost  like a round, with phraseology that is constantly repeated and recombined. The focus  of the hymn is narrow: the three strides made by Viṣṇu, which measured out the cos mic spaces, earth, midspace, and heaven, and provided room for the creatures to live.  These strides are also conceived of as footsteps, which contain the good things sought  by the poet, and which he aspires to reach (vss. 5–6). This goal provides a forward  thrust to the poem, despite the uniformity of the vocabulary throughout. Viṣṇu’s  footsteps are also credited with somewhat surprising actions: in verse 4 they “find ela tion by their own power” and in verse 6 the highest step “shines down amply.”
