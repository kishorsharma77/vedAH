The poet re-uses mehánā from V.38.3 and rā́dhaḥ from V.38.1, as well as adrivaḥ (though that voc. is quite common in this run of hymns). Because of their commitment to mehánā as ‘rain’ in 38.3, WG are forced to insert rain here, though the context is hardly favorable.

The Pp. reads ubhayāhastí with short -í, which is assigned to an -i-stem by Gr, as a neut. modifying rā́dhaḥ, though he also suggests that it might be read -ī́, as the masc. nom. sg. of an -ín-stem. The latter works better morphologically than the former: hastín- is well attested and well formed, whereas there is no straight -i-stem hastí- and no easy mechanism for producing one -- though a nonce back-formation from the well-formed adj. -hasti ya- might be possible. See esp. ubhayāhasti yā́vásu in I.81.7. (A neut. to the -ín-stem would likewise probably come out as -í, and this may be an easier solution). I nonetheless tentatively suggest that ubhayāhastí here (if that is the reading) might be compared with the problematic dakṣiṇít ‘with the right (hand)’ in nearby V.36.4, which appears in the same kind of context, concerns hands, and has a problematic suffixal short -i-, followed there by a morphologically mysterious dental final.
