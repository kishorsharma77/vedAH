The nominal rel. cl. yád … ásti is in some sense pleonastic: the two ppl.

baddhám and kṛtám could simply modify the neut. énaḥ directly. But the structure seems designed to sketch a two-level structure: the outrage commited (by us) that is bound to us. Note that abl. asmát should be construed with the main cl. (“unhitch, release … from us”: áva syatam muñcátam … asmát), and so the rel. cl. is technically speaking embedded. But this seems to be one of the fairly common examples of semi-embedded izafe-type relative clauses.
