Agni
Utkīla Kātya
6 verses: br̥hatī alternating with satobr̥hatī, arranged in pragāthas
The hymn consists of pragātha distichs of one br̥hatī verse and one satobr̥hatī verse. The metrics thus organize the verses into three pairs. Structurally, however,  the poet also emphasizes the unity of the hymn through ring composition: verse 1  refers to Agni as the master of saúbhaga “good fortune” and of rayí “wealth,” and  verse 6 to him as subhága “bearer of good fortune” and the agent of “wealth.” Once again, as in the preceding hymn, the description of Agni evokes Indra, espe cially in verse 1, which refers to Agni as the “master of the smashing of obsta cles,” and in verse 2, in which the poet calls on the troops of Indra, the Maruts,  to follow Agni.
