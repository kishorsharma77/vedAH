I take abhikhyā́in the sense of ‘glance’ rather than ‘appearance’ (as Gr, Re, and Scar 99 do). The finite forms of abhí √khyā all have the meaning ‘look at’, as do the 2 occurrences of the gerund abhikhyā́ya (I.155.5, II.30.9). abhikhyā́occurs 3 times (here + I.148.5, X.112.10, all compatible with a meaning ‘glance’ [pace Gr]). It may either be the instr. sg. of a root noun or (with AiG II.2.782) a haplologized form of the gerund abhikhyā́ya. Both possibilities are considered by Scar (98-99).
