I have tr. the fem. gen. pl. rel. yā́sām as ‘when’, to make the structure of subord. cl. (ab) - main cl. (cd) work better. However it is possible (and perhaps preferable) to take the yā́sām cl. as simply continuing vs. 3: “Smash down the troop of those witches … of which (witches) you scattered afar thrice fifty.” 4cd would then be an independent sentence.

Who the subject of cd is depends on what the verb manāyati means. Ge takes the subj. as a generic, or at least unidentified, “er”: “das merkt er sich fein von dir.” Re thinks the subj. is one of the witches, but like Ge he takes manāya- to mean something like ‘pay attention, note, understand’. The verb is an obvious denom. to manā́-, which is interpr. by some as ‘Andacht’ (prayer, reverence) (see EWA s.v. MAN1 ), with the verb then meaning ‘andächtig sein’ (be reverent towards)(so WG here, again with a generic subject, “man”). But since I interpret manā́as ‘zeal’, for me the verb means ‘display zeal’, with the implicit subj. Indra’s deed, represented by the neut. pronouns tát (c) and takát (d).

Pronominal -ka-forms, like takát, are an extreme sign of colloquial register -- or rather of the poets overtly signalling their conscious deployment of this register.
