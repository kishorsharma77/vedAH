The vs. begins a little oddly with a solemn proclamation to a drop (índave), but in my opinion this is actually indirectly evoking the word-play, esp. common in Maṇḍala IX, between índu- ‘drop’ and índra-, the more natural addressee here. The transition between drop and Indra is effected by the beginning of the next pāda, hávyo ná. I take hávya- as a pun; though the occurrences of this stem are overwhelmingly associated with the root √hū, hvā ‘invoke’, hence ‘to be invoked’, it could technically also be built to the root √hu ‘pour’, hence ‘to be poured’ (see the differently accented but identically formed havyá- ‘oblation’). I read hávyaḥ with both meanings here, with ‘to be invoked’ in the simile and referring to Indra and ‘to be poured’ directly referring to the drop. Both Indra and the drop stimulate the verbal skills of the poet. I see no reason to assume that the referent is Bhaga, pace Ge, Re (and tentatively Old). The rakṣohán- ‘demon-smasher’ in c may be, as often, soma, but is more likely Indra, given hantā́pāpásya rakṣásaḥ and rakṣoháṇam, both of Indra, in vs. 11.

The repeated final verb réjati (bc) is nicely echoed in e by (vadhaí)r ajeta.

The cmpd. aghá-śamṣa- finds its analytical parallel in I.128.5 śáṃsād aghā́t.

The lexeme áva √sru, lit. ‘flow down’, appears only here (fg) in the RV; I suggest that it may idiomatically mean ‘be miscarried, aborted’, and the kṣudrám ‘speck’ in g is the embryo/fetus. For abortion in a hostile context in this group of hymns, see I.127.3, at least acdg. to my interpretation.

Like the last verse, this one, quite unusually, disrupts the strict final repetition of the fg pādas, with áva sravet opening f, but distracted to áva … sravet in g. I again have no explanation for this.
