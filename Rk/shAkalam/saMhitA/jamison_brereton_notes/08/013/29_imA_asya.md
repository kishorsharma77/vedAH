As Ge says, the subject here probably remains the Maruts. The question is whether “which is in heaven” is a restrictive or non-restrictive relative clause - that is, are there various possible tracks and it’s the one in heaven that they like, or is there one track and it happens to be in heaven. My inclination is to take it as restrictive, and the track or footstep in which they take pleasure is the one called elsewhere the paramá- (I.22.20-21, 72.2, 4, 154.5, etc.), upamá- (V.3.3), or uttamá- (V.51.4) ‘highest’, as well as divás padá- (IX.10.9, 83.2). There seems to be an implicit contrast to this high and distant padá-, which they like, and “the navel of the sacrifice” (nā́bhā yajñásya), where they find themselves. But these locations may be more complementary than contrastive, since the “highest track/footstep” often seems to indicate a place where a heavenly form of the earthly sacrifice is conducted simultaneously. See, e.g., I.22.20-21 and remarks on I.21.6.
