Soma is here identified with the three principal Ādityas. This vs. is identical to IX.88.8, though the two publ. tr. differ in pāda b. I would now alter the tr. here to “yours is his lofty, deep domain, o Soma.” See disc. ad IX.88.8.

The (pseudo-)gerundive dakṣā́yya- has attracted a number of different renderings -- in this passage alone, Ge “zu Gunst geneigt,” Re “qu’on doit-servirefficacement,” WG “als Zufriedenzustellender.” I prefer to tie it more closely with dákṣa- ‘skill’, as “whose skill is to be sought,” despite the awkwardness of the English gloss. In this passage Soma was just credited with skill (2b) and will later dispense it (7c; cf. also 14c), and in both I.129.2 and VII.97.8 the ability of Indra and Bṛhaspati to bring about good things is emphasized. JPB in VII.1.2 prefers “to be skillfully tended,” quite close to Re’s rendering above. This latter tr. would work for Agni (II.4.3, VII.1.2), who requires ritual tending, but less well for Indra, Bṛhaspati, and (here) Aryaman.
