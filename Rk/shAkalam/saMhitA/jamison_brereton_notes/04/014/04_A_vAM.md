The splv. váhiṣṭha- in the pl. is found in both 13.4 and 14.4; the verb of motion is yāsi in 13.4 and vahantu in 14.4.

The referent of the 2nd du. must be the Aśvins (so also Old [SBE], WG, pace Re, who supplies Agni and Dawn). Though they are unnamed, the near identity of pāda b with IV.45.2b in an Aśvin hymn makes this identification most likely, esp.

since soma and honey are the drinks of choice of the Aśvins.
