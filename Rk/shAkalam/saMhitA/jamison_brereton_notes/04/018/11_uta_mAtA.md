The plot gets a bit murky here. His mother, having sent him off alone in vs. 10, now follows him, with the fear that the gods are abandoning him. This seems to happen much later, just before the Vṛtra battle and long after the birth and her own abandonment of the baby. But, despite her fears about the other gods, Indra finds a companion on his own -- Viṣṇu, who is not usually a party to the Vṛtra battle.
