The subjunctive pátāt seems to be used in an unusual past prospective sense in this mythological context. This may be an English problem, however. Since the verb of the main clause is injunc. vidhat, this context is not necessarily preterital, but “timeless,” and the subjunctive can therefore be expressing pure future modality.

The fact that the next verse is also mythological and contains an undoubted present tense form daśasyathaḥ shows that mythological tense is fluid here. Re remarks (ad vs. 23) that the indifference between present and preterite underlines the reflection of the current human situation in the legendary material.
