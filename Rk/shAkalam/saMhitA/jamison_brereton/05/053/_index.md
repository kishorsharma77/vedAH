A metrically complex hymn, though there is no reason to consider it a composite.  The internal groupings, mostly two-verse units, follow those suggested by Oldenberg  (1888: 106–8). The hymn mingles descriptions of and wishes for the Maruts’ jour ney here with descriptions of the storm and the desirable rain the Maruts bring,  and indeed the Maruts and the rains are sometimes identified, sometimes modulate  from one to the other.  

The hymn opens (vss. 1–2), as often, with questions—what is the origin of  Maruts and where have they gone? The Maruts themselves answer, indirectly, in  verse 3, and demand praise, which is forthcoming in verse 4. The description of a  storm follows (vss. 5–7), and the Maruts are urged to come here with their rains  (vss. 8–11). The poet returns in verses 12–13 to the question raised at the begin  
ning: to what sacrificer have the Maruts gone? The hope is of course that they have  come or will come to us, and the blessings we wish to receive are detailed in the final  verses (14–16.)
