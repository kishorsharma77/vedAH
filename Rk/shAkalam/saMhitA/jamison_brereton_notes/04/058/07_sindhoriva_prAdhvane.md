A difficult verse, primarily because of the two hapaxes, śūghanā́saḥ and vā́tapramiyaḥ. The former is taken by Ge as ‘whirlpools, eddies’ (Wirbel)(followed not terribly enthusiastically by Re) on no particular basis, and others have added their own at best weakly supported tr.: e.g., Thieme ‘cow-killing’ [śū- < *pśu-] KlSch. 52), most recently WG ‘die schwellenden Massen’ (presumably with root noun 1st member and later ghana- ‘clump, mass’). The interpr. reflected in the publ. tr. is no stronger than these others. It begins with ghaná- ‘smiter’ (well represented in the RV), as Th’s also must. But for 1st member I assume a zero-grade of āśú- ‘swift’ (for the uncertainties of the initial of the PIE ‘swift’ words, see EWA s.v.) with lengthening at compound seam. With two such ad hoc assumptions, this interpr. is simply a place-holder.

As for vā́tapramiyaḥ, there is no question about its component parts, merely about how they fit together. -pramiyaḥ patterns with the nearby forms IV.54.4 pramíye (‘to be violated’) and IV.55.7 pramíyam (‘to violate’). It also strongly recalls I.24.6 ná yé vā́tasya praminánti ábhvam “nor those [=the gods] who confound the wind’s formless mass.” As Old points out, this latter passage fixes the interpr. of our cmpd.: the first member must be functionally the object of the 2nd. The problem is the accent; it should be a bahuvrīhi, not a tatpuruṣa. See, however, Scar (388), who suggests a plausible bahuvrīhi interpr. ‘die Schmälerung des Windes habend’, with the first member essentially an objective genitive. The point is that the speed and violence of the streams are stronger than those of the wind, which is thus confounded.

I read kā́ṣṭhā(ḥ) in both simile and frame: in the simile it refers to the wooden barriers of the race-course that the horse splits in his speeding around the course, in the frame to sticks floating in the current of the streams and split (against rocks vel sim.) by the violent speed of that current. (Of course the “frame” here is itself metaphorical, since these are streams of ghee, not actual watercourses.)
