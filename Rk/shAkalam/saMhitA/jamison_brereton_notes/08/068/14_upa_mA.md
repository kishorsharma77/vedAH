Ge supplies ‘horses’ with the numbers of pāda a, separating them from the men of b: “… sechs (Rosse), je zwei und zwei, (und) die Herren…,” because the next verse definitely has six horses. But Hoffmann’s (1967: 233) suggestion that there are six men, who are the leaders of the horses, makes the verse less jerky and avoids having to supply both a noun (horses) and a conjunction (and).
