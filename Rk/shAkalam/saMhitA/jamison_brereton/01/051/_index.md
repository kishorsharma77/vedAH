Indra
Savya Āṅgirasa
15 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 14–15
This hymn consists primarily of an elaborated list of Indra’s great deeds, some  well known (like the Vala myth in 3a, the Vr̥tra myth in 4, Indra’s involvement164 I.51
with Uśanā Kāvya and Kutsa in the slaying of Śuṣṇa in verses 6a, 10–11) and  others quite obscure. For example, Vimada, mentioned in 3ab, is usually a client  of the Aśvins, who supply him with a wife (often using the same verb [√vah “con vey”] as here: I.112.9, 116.1, 117.20; X.39.7, 65.12). Is the same deed attributed to  Indra here and is the “good thing” that Indra brings him a reference to the wife?  Similarly puzzling are the enemies who make oblation “on the shoulder” in verse 5  (perhaps indicating people following different ritual practices and not part of the  Ārya community; see vss. 8–9), Indra’s role as an ant destroying walls in verse 9,  and his transformation into the female consort of an otherwise unknown figure in  verse 13c.
The catalogue of deeds is interrupted by demands that Indra use his same mar tial powers for our benefit (vss. 7–9ab), and it is framed by an exhortation to the  poets to give praise to the god (vs. 1) and the announcement of the end of the praise  hymn and the boons we seek from it (vss. 14–15).
