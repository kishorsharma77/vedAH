My interpr. of the du. dhā́manī in 2 as the two cosmic domains allows the contrast between that form and the pl. dhā́māni to make sense. We have moved from the cosmic, to the ritual, in particular to the ritual ground - and here the pl. ‘domains’ are the ritual spaces that Soma traverses and encloses. This change of venue and focus is signalled esp. by ṛtúbhiḥ ‘according to the ritual sequences’. Thus the themes of space and the cosmic reach of Soma that I identified as characteristic of this hymn find economical expression in the transition from the cosmic Soma in vs. 2 to the ritual Soma of vs. 3.

The main verb of this clause is pári … asi, in the formula viśvátaḥ pári √as ‘surround entirely’ (on which see my 1998 “Rigvedic viśvátaḥ sīm, Or, Why Syntax Needs Poetics,” Fs. Watkins). Within this phrase we seem to have an embedded rel. cl. yā́ni te “which are yours,” dependent on the obj. dhā́māni, and embedded relatives are generally blocked in the RV. But as we have noted elsewhere (see, e.g., comm. ad VI.21.2, 22.5), nominal rel. clauses are an exception to this rule, and here the yā́ni seems to be displaying (proto-)izafe behavior.
