The plethora of ritual fires implied by the āmreḍita agním-agnim in vs. 2 is made more explicit in this expression of the kindling of one fire by another, presumably (as Ge suggests) through the taking out of the Āhavanīya fire from the Gārhapatya, much treated in the later ritual lit. The Āhavanīya may be referred to in 5a ghṛ́ta-āhavana- ‘whose oblation is ghee’, and in this vs. the second pāda (6b) might contain allusions to the three ritual fires, gṛhápati- ‘houselord’ a transparent reference to the Gārhapatya and yúvan- ‘youth’ referring to the newly kindled Āhavanīya (see pāda a). However, this would leave kaví- ‘poet, sage-poet’ as a designation of the Dakṣināgni, which doesn’t make a lot of sense, as far as I can see.
