The mythology behind ab is related in I.143.2, as Ge points out; see also VI.8.4. It is not clear here why a mythological situation should be couched in the imperative (“become manifest!”), esp. as the second hemistich contains three augmented imperfects, but I cannot see any way to fix it. As Old points out, various scholars have suggested reading injunc. bhavaḥ but it is not easy to switch that form in, esp. because 1) the hymn has no other injunctives, and 2) the stem bháva- doesn't have any clear injunctives, certainly no bhavaḥ, in the RV. In I.143.2 the same myth is related in the same phraseology in the impf.: ā́vír agnír abhavan mātaríśvane.

sukratūyā́must mean something more than simply krátvā / krátunā; see the denom. sukratūyase in X.122.6.
