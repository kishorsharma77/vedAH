Judging from Ge’s tr. of the first pāda, “Davor sei mir Bewahrung,” he takes ā́t as an ablative pronoun referring to ámaḥ in 14c (his “Panik,” my “onslaught”), but as far as I can tell, ā́t is elsewhere only adverbial, as opposed to the fuller pronominal form asmā́t. I also question his modal, indeed imperatival interpretation of bhuvat in this preterital context; thematic forms belonging originally to the root aorist stem (á)bhū- can be either subjunctive or a secondarily thematicized injunctive. See Hoffmann 1967 passim, esp. 214-15.
