Indra  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
9 verses: gāyatrī  
This simple hymn hardly deviates from the theme of Indra’s soma-drinking, a  concentration that is reflected in the repetitive elements: the vocative índra (gener ally verse- or pāda-initial) in seven of the nine verses (1–6, 9) and the collocation  “pressed soma” in four verses (1–2, 4–5) and split over another two (6/7). Note also  the conjoined expressions “nearby and afar” (vs. 8) and “afar and nearby” (vs. 9),  together forming a “magic square.”
