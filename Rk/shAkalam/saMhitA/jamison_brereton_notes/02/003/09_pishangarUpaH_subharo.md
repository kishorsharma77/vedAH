subhára- here is used in a different sense (or senses) from the same word in 4b, where it referred to the good burden, that is, the seated gods, that the barhis was bearing. Here I think there is a pun: the hero is ‘easy to bear’, that is, his birth, depicted in pāda b, was easy. But the hero so born provides good support to those who depend on him.

With Re, I tr. ví ṣyatu in two slightly different senses with two different objects: ‘unbind’ with ‘navel’ (nā́bhim), referring to the technicalities of the birth process, and ‘release’ with ‘offspring’ (prajā́m), referring to the results of birth.

The Tvaṣṭar verse in Āprī hymns generally directly concerns only his participation in the birth process (see I.142.10, III.4.9=VII.2.9, X.110.9, X.142.10; our pādas abc). Releasing the sacrificial animal and escorting it to (the fold/pen of) the gods is properly the province of the post (“Lord of the Forest,” vánaspátiḥ, 10a), and that expression (“go to [the fold of] the gods”) is a euphemism for the animal’s death. However, note X.70.9-10, where both Tvaṣṭar and the Lord of the Forest convey the animal to the fold of the gods (devā́nām pā́thaḥ). Like X.70.9 our pāda d implies that the journey of the sacrifical animal (that is, its death) occurs under the auspices of Tvaṣṭar, and in fact, given the apparent temporal/logical connector áthā beginning pāda d, the implication is that the offspring born in abc is to undertake this journey. This seems rather muddled: our new (human) offspring is not the sacrificial animal. I think the roles of Tvaṣṭar and the Lord of the Forest were quite distinct, but conflations like this could occur because the Tvaṣṭar and Vanaspati vss. are always adjacent in Āprī hymns and because the vocabulary is similar: Tvaṣṭar’s ví √sā ‘unbind/release’ and Vanaspati’s áva √sṛj ‘release/discharge’. The fact that the victim is usually not overly expressed (presumably a euphemistic avoidance) makes confusion all the more likely.
