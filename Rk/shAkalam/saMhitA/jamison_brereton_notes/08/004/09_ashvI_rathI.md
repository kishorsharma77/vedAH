This verse returns to the theme of vs. 6, the prosperity of a man who has Indra on his side. The only difficult phrase is śvātrabhā́jā váyasā, which Ge takes as referring to a particular age in the life of a man: “Er steht jederzeit in dem Alter, in dem man die Vollkraft besitzt.” Although váyas- can refer to a vigorous time of life, it generally means simply ‘vigor’ itself, and I also find it hard to make sacate + INSTR mean “steht … in.” I think that it simply refers to the waxing prosperity and strength of the man in question.
