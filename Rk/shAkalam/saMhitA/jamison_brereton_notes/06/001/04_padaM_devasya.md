Again Ge claims that this verse is about the myth of the flight of Agni, presumably on the basis of padám devásya … vyántaḥ, but the track of the god doesn't have to be his flight, but simply the ritual cursus.

How one interprets the larger sense of the vs. depends on how one interprets the verb forms: āpan, dadhire, and raṇayanta, esp. the first. Both Ge and Re take āpan as preterital (“… haben sie … erlangt,” “ont obtenu”), presumably taking it as a pluperfect or a thematic aorist (both either augmented or not) to √āp, and Ge clearly thinks the subj. is the Aṅgirases. (Gr takes it as an aor.) But nothing prevents it from being a pf. subjunctive. In that case, the priests pursuing the ritual cursus in a, who are seeking fame (śravasyávaḥ), will obtain fame through their priestly activities. The pf. dadhire in c can then have, as often, immediate past reference (“they have assumed names” - presumably their priestly titles), and the injunctive raṇayanta in d is easily compatible with that scenario as a general timeless presential. Because of the otherwise exclusive focus on the ritual function of Agni in this hymn, my interpr.

seems preferable to one that goes haring off into the mythological past.

Note śrávaḥ … ámṛktam “indestructible fame” as a variation on the formula śrávaḥ … ákṣitam.
