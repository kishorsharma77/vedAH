Indra
Vasiṣṭha Maitrāvaruṇi
9 verses: virāj 1–8, triṣṭubh 9
The focus of this hymn is entirely ritual: Indra is invited to drink the soma and to  listen to the hymns of the poet, Vasiṣṭha, who in the 1st person names himself in  verse 3 and calls attention to his devotion in verses 5 and 7. He acknowledges that  there are competing rituals designed for Indra (vss. 6–7) and also acknowledges  that no ritual activities and no hymns of men can quite measure up to the worth  of Indra (vss. 8–9). Indeed, in this case Vasiṣṭha’s modesty seems justified: though  the hymn is pleasingly phrased, it hardly counts as one of the pinnacles of R̥gvedic  praise poetry.
