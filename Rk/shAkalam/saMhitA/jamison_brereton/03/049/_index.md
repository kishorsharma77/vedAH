Indra  
Viśvāmitra Gāthina  
5 verses: triṣṭubh  
The first word of this hymn, śáṃsā “I will proclaim” (or possibly 2nd sg. imperative  “proclaim!”), sets the tone for the rest, which consists entirely of descriptive glori fication (save for the refrain). There are no direct requests, though the praise of his  victorious power and of his control of goods implicitly invites the god to exert the  same for the singer and his community.
