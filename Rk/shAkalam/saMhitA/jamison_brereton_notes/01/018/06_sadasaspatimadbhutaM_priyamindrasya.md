ayāsiṣam: I take this form to the root √yā ‘beseech, implore’, not to √yā ‘drive, go’, which does, admittedly, have a well-attested -siṣ-aorist. So also WG, though other translators (including Schmidt, B+I) render as a verb of motion (Ge “habe ich … angegangen”). That interpretation isn’t impossible, but ‘beseech’ fits the context better.
