This is the only possible passage in the RV in which gṛhápati- ‘houselord’ may refer to a human (as also noted by Oberlies, I.355 n. 99); in all other cases its referent is Agni. (See my forthcoming “The Term gṛhastha and the (Pre)history of the Householder.”) The presence of nárya- ‘stemming from men’ and vīrá- ‘hero’ may support a human reading for gṛhápati-; in both cases we seem to be aiming for valuable goods given to us by human patrons, and “a houselord of value” (vāmáṃ gṛhápatim) would be a third such instance. However, since both nṛ́- and vīrá- can also refer to gods in the RV, the human element is by no means assured, and the otherwise exclusive use of gṛhápati- for a god in the RV is telling. If the word does refer to a human, this may be another indication of the popular character and lower linguistic register of the Pūṣan hymns, as gṛhápati- does refer to humans in the AV.

DL suggests to me that, though the dominant sense of vāmá- here must be ‘valuable’, there might be a pun on vāmá- (or vā́ma-; see EWA s.v.) ‘left’, immediately following práyata-dakṣiṇam. The 2nd member of that bahuvrīhi is of course dákṣiṇā- ‘priestly gift’, but the adj. stem dákṣiṇa- means ‘right (/south)’.

Although vāmá-/vā́ma- ‘left’ is not attested until the ŚB, it could well have been current in ordinary speech before that, as its presence in MIA (e.g., Pāli vāma-) suggests. Perhaps another sign of the more demotic lexicon of this hymn.
