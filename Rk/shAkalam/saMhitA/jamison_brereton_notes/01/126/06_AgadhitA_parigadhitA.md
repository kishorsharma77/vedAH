On the meaning ‘smell’ for the intensive jáṅgahe see Lubotsky (JAOS 117 [1997]: 562-63 [rev. of Schaeffer, Intensiv]); Griffiths and Lubotsky (JAOS 119 [1999]: 480-81). The word kaśīkā- is found only here. If it refers to a mongoose (or perhaps the related civet cat), the naturalistic description makes sense, as Lubotsky (JAOS 117) argues: squeezed on the back, mongooses release a musky odor. (This is characteristic of both sexes at least of civet cats, though Lubotsky seems to think it is only true of males mongooses.) As I have argued elsewhere (Ged. Cowgill, 1987, p.

89), this hapax may appear in this passage because Kakṣīvant is making another play on his own name (see above, comm. I.125.2).

The second hemistich appears to be a fairly graphic depiction of sexual intercourse and, like other such passages, is difficult to interpret because of the obscurity of the vocabulary and the slangy style. The difficulties here reside primarily in the hapax yā́durī and the near hapax yā́śu-. The rest -- dádāti máhyam … bhojyā̀śatā́-- is relatively straightforward: “She gives me 100 …” I differ from the standard tr. in taking bhojyā̀not as acc. pl. neut. ‘pleasures’, but as a fem. sg.

gerundive. Although we would expect the accentuation *bhójyā, the suffixal accent here may be a redactional change to follow bhojyā̀in nearby I.128.5 after our passage was no longer understood. I take this gerundive as belonging to both roots √bhuj ‘enjoy’ and ‘bend, coil’: the woman in question is to be coiled around (in sex) and thus to be enjoyed.

As for yā́śu- this word appears a few other times in compounds: budbudáyāśu- (X.155.4), where it seems to refer to ejaculations (as insubstantial as) bubbles; fem. suyā́śutarā (X.86.6), where Indrāṇī boasts about herself -- I tr. “gives better sex” -- and ayāśú- (AV VIII.6.15) as an epithet of hideous minor demons tormenting pregnant women, where Whitney plausibly but tentatively tr. ‘impotent’.

I take it to mean something like ‘ejaculation’, which I’ve rendered as ‘spurts’ to avoid a clinical tone.

yā́durī- appears to belong to the marginal root √yād ‘unite’ (see EWA s.v. YĀD); I render the nominal here by ‘fusing’.

As often, I think the presence of these rare words serves more than one purpose — in this case to produce an encoded pun on the root √yabh ‘fuck’. Note the repetition of yā’s, starting with yā́in b, but taking off in cd: … (mah)ya yā́(durī) yā́(śūnāṃ bhojí)yā … This repetition of the initial of the root might have the same effect as the English expression “the f-word,” and it also gives the impression of a stutterer saying “ya … ya … ya …” while the bh eludes him -- until he reaches bh(ojyā̀) and finally achieves the whole word.
