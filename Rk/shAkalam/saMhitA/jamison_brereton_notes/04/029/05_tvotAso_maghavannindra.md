Ge (/WG) construe the part. bhejānā́saḥ one way or another with syāma (Ge: “… möchten wir … deines himmlischen Reichtums teilhaftig werden”). This is certainly possible. However since this leaves te in b somewhat orphaned and since “may we be yours” is a frequent sentiment (e.g., II.11.13), I have separated the participle from syāma, respecting the hemistich boundary.
