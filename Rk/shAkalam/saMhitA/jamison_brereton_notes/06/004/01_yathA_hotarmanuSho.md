… ínvati dráviṇāni with ‘goods’ and ‘chattels, treasures’ as obj. respectively.

But these passages lack the preverb: although Gr lists VI.5.3 with ví as preverb, and Ge apparently follows him, ví in that passage should be construed otherwise, not as a preverb with inoṣi; see comm. ad loc. In my opinion a more telling parallel is found in VI.10.7, also in this Agni cycle, with the ví: ví dvéṣāṃsīnuhí “dispel hatreds.” Re also considers the expression to be negative, on the basis of the same parallel, and tr.

“lui qui chasse au loin (les ennemis).” The preverb ví is not found elsewhere with this verb. IH now makes the attractive sugg. that the obj. is actually the ‘smoke’ implied in the first hemistich. I consider this an alternative possibility.

In d the verb śiśnathat is construed with an acc. pūrvyā́ṇi, but the referent of this generic adj. ‘primordial’ is not clear. Other occurrences of both of these words (√śnath and pūrvyá-) don't give clear formulaic guidance for what to supply as the real obj. This pāda is identical to II.20.5, an Indra hymn, and it does seem imported from an Indraic context here. (Bloomfield does not comment in RVReps.) Ge supplies Burgen (with ?) here, but Werke in II.20.5. Although the former works fine semantically, púr- ‘fortress’ is fem. and so is excluded. Re supplies “performances”; he does not indicate what Sanskrit word he had in mind or why he thought it was apposite. Though it is the case that both kṛtā́ni and kármāṇi appear with pū́rvyā(ṇi), I do not see how one can ‘pierce’ them. I supply ‘domains’ (dhā́māni), on the basis of IV.55.2 dhā́māni pūrvyā́ṇi, VIII.41.10 dhā́ma pūrvyám, although not with a great deal of confidence.

Ge and Re take áśna- as a PN, but I see no reason not to take it, with Gr, as a straightforward derivative of √aś ‘eat’. Mayr splits the difference in his PN book, listing it as a PN but noting its likely original identity with the adj. áśna- ‘hungry’.
