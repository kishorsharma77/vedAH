It is with considerable relief that we return to Indra.

In c I tr. kā́te níṣattiḥ -- lit. “What is this sitting down of yours?” -- more idiomatically, to convey the exasperation of the singer.

The sequence kím u nó …, kíṃ nód-ud u …is playful and, probably for that reason, somewhat difficult to parse. The nó in the first part of the phrase appears in the Pp. as no iti. Although normally a final -o of this type, generally found on the end of function words, represents -ā/a plus the particle u (see Klein, Part. u, 168-78), Klein specifically lists this passage (168 n. 3) as a case where the presence of u is unlikely because “the syntactic environments within which u is found do not appear.” It is easy to see why he came to that judgment, esp. because there’s an u almost immediately preceding it and the 2nd u would come very late in the syntactic complex.

However, it is difficult to see what else to make of it, and the almost mirror image in the next pāda, where there’s a coalescence of ná + úd into nód and an even later u following the complex of kím NEG PREV, suggests that the poet is having a bit of fun with u. Given the colloquial tone of this hemistich, we may also be seeing a looser deployment of particles and “little” words characteristic of ordinary speech. (And who can resist the lilt of nód-ud u?) The multiplication of u’s is completed by a form of the notorious -tavā́u infinitive at the end of d.
