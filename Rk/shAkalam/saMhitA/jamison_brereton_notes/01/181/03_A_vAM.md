The adjectival descriptor of the chariot ahampūrváḥ is transparently derived from a nominal clause “I am in front / I’m ahead,” however unlikely this may be as the utterance of a chariot.

The second hemistich consists entirely of a nominal relative clause referring to the chariot, with two vocatives, the phrasal vṛ́ṣṇa sthātārā “you mounters of the bull” in initial position and dhiṣṇi yā near the end. The latter is commonly used of the Aśvins (see, e.g., I.182.1c, 2a, in the next hymn). Here the voc. is followed by the rel.

pronoun yáḥ, which ends the clause. This is a remarkably odd position for a rel.

pronoun, and since this supposed rel. cl. consists of nominative qualifiers of the subject of the main clause, ráthaḥ, it need not have been a relative clause at all: the whole of the vs. could simply be a main clause. I think the yáḥ got stuck pleonastically on the end of this pāda to provide a monosyllable to make a Triṣṭubh cadence. (Cf. VI.63.6, a Triṣṭubh that ends dhiṣṇi yā vām, likewise with a final monosyllable.) No harm is done by this last-ditch conversion of the string of epithets in cd into a nominal rel. clause, but it is a metrically driven afterthought in my opinion. It should certainly not be taken as a standard ex. of rel. cl. word order.

The phrase mánaso jávīyān is an analytic version of manojū́- in 2c, there applied to the horses, not the chariot.
