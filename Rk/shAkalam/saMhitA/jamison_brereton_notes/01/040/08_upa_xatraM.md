Most tr. (including Schmidt) render pṛñcītá with the anodyne ‘increase’, but úpa √pṛc is a sexual idiom (‘inseminate’ < ‘engorge’; see, e.g., VI.28.8). The accent on this verb probably results from its adjacency to accented hánti (on which see, HO and JSK - reff.). Note the gapping out of compound in the contrastive phrase mahādhané … árbhe “when there is a large stake or a small,” where the independent loc. árbhe is functionally parallel to the 1st compound member mahā-.
