The verb puró dadhe gives a more Agni-esque cast to the vs. than the more Indraic vss. that have preceded.

The standard tr. separate c and d into two clauses, but I think the two expressions are meant to be balanced against each other. The idea seems to be that though (cid) the two gods deserve portions (árhantā), I have set them out as if they theselves were portions (áṃśā-iva), prizes for a prize-winning steed. What it means to “set them out” I don’t know. It’s worth noting that √arh regularly takes pītím ‘drink(ing), share of drink’ as object (e.g., V.51.6), so the reciprocal notion would be familiar to the audience.
