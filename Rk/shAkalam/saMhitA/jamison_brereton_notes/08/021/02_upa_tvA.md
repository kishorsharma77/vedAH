dhṛṣát is ordinarily an adverb, originally probably the neut. of a VIth class present of which there are no finite forms - except, possibly, this one. The relative pronoun yáḥ invites dhṛṣát to be read as a 3rd sg. injunctive (and of course in a relative clause its accent would be correct). I would suggest that either the neut. part.

dhṛṣát has been misanalyzed and pressed into service as a finite form or that yáḥ is serving as a loose izafe connecting this adverbial qualifier with the subject.

On metrically bad vavṛmahe, see comm. ad Kü (459) and comm. ad VI.4.7.

Old suggests that the “youth” is King Citra, whose dānastuti ends the hymn.

This seems perfectly plausible but nonetheless unprovable.
