It is striking that pāda a is reused in the famous Yama-Yamī dialogue hymn (X.10.5b), where Yamī claims that Tvaṣṭar made them a married couple in the womb. I do not think there is an echo of that story here; the point of intersection is simply the association of Tvaṣṭar with conception, pregnancy, and birth (cf., e.g., X.184).

Acdg. to the standard interpr. (Ge [/WG], Re; cf. Klein DGRV I.218, Kü 314), prajā́ḥ is to be construed with pupóṣa, on the basis of X.170.1 prajā́ḥ pupoṣa purudhā́… This is not impossible, but it seems unnecessary, esp. as the latter hymn is quite late. It also implies that purudhā́should also be construed with pupóṣa, but this is impossible because jajāna is unaccented. It is also unlikely that prajā́ḥ and purudhā́should be separated, given purudhā́prajā́vān in the next hymn (III.56.3b).

At best we can take prajā́ḥ purudhā́with both verbs: “thrives with regard to offspring in great quantity and has begotten them [=offspring in great quantity]” or perhaps “thrives with regard to offspring and has begotten them [=offspring] in great quantity.” Such an interpr., with an acc. of respect and a fundamentally intransitive verb, follows that of Kü (314). I do not believe that pupóṣa here can have the transitive/causative sense that the other tr. ascribe to it (e.g., Re “a fait fleurir les créatures”).
