The difficult words dhénā and prapṛñcatī́complicate the interpretation of this verse. The former, investigated in detail by H.-P. Schmidt (Gd. Nyberg), is now generally interpreted as ‘(milk)stream’, rendering Geldner’s ‘lip’ and Renou’s ‘tongue’ out of date. As for prapṛñcatī́, the simplex pṛñcatī́appears in another Praügaśastra hymn (I.23.16), modifying waters and referring to the mixing of milk (acc.) with honey (instr.). Given the similarity of context, a direct object referring to a liquid should be supplied.

What is also puzzling here is in what way the ‘stream’ is Vāyu’s: it should not originate with him, but rather be destined for him, but then why is the ‘pious man’ apparently receiving the benefit of it? As in the next verse, there seems to be a bit of role reversal here, with the gods depicted as providing the ritual benefits rather than receiving them. Presumably the point is that the pious man gets the benefit secondarily, by having pleased the god, but the dative dāśúṣe is striking, esp. as it is apparently parallel grammatically (though it cannot be functionally) to the dat. sómapītaye ending the verse. Although the verse presumably depicts the sacrificer’s offering of soma to Vāyu to drink, the lexicon and the case usage complicate the message.
