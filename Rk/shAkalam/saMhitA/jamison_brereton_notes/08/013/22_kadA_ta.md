One piece of evidence for my interpretation of the preceding tṛca as having the praiser (stotár-) as its thematic center is his reappearance in this verse, in this anxious question. The verse expresses the reciprocity inherent in the ritual situation, with the praiser wishing to be “most wealful” for Indra, while also receiving his own benefits from the god. This reminds us of verse 17, where the poets (quite possibly the Maruts) were both seeking help and making Indra increase through the help they gave him.
