In b both Ge and Re take uṣásaḥ as a nom. pl. rather than a gen. sg. as I do (e.g., “commes les aurores avec leur rayon”). Either would work contextually.

However, in IV.1.17 in the phrase uṣáso bhānúḥ (like our uṣáso ná bhānúnā), uṣásaḥ has to be gen. sg. and Ge so interprets it there.

In c and d I take the crucial terms with double reference, in both simile and frame. In c this term is the pres. part. tū́rvan: in the frame it refers to Agni and is construed with loc. yā́man “going in triumph on his course”; in the simile it is construed with loc. ráṇe “like the victor in the battle.” The battle with (lit. of) Etaśa is a reference to the conflict between Indra and the Sun involving the Sun’s horse Etaśa in some unfortunately puzzling way. To make this clear, “battle over Etaśa would be a better rendering, as MLW points out to me. A further resonance of this phrase tū́rvan ná yā́man is the PN Tūrvayāṇa found several times in the RV, incl.

nearby VI.18.13.

nū́in c seems to have no function and is curiously positioned, though it might be noted that there's a minority position of nú/nū́, penultimate in the pāda, and this is fairly common in VI.

As for d, the standard interpr. (Old ZDMG 313 + Noten, Ge, Re) take the part.

tatṛṣānáḥ only with the simile; this requires supplying an elaborate verbal predicate (“goes to water”) that is not found in the Sanskrit; cf., e.g., Old “er der herbei (eilt) wie im Sonnenbrand der Durstende (zum Wasser eilt).” I again think that the participle applies in both simile and frame: in the simile it refers to someone becoming thirsty in the (sun’s) heat, whereas in the frame it refers to Agni “thirsting” for oblations. This participle is used unambiguously of Agni elsewhere (I.31.7, II.4.6) in describing his voracious appetite for fuel.

In a clever poetic trick the sun is referred to indirectly in both c (his horse Etaśa) and d (his heat: ghṛṇá-).
