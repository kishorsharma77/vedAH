vīthó adhvarám exactly matches vītho adhvarám in 3d (save for the accent).

Here, unlike the false identity in vs. 6 just discussed, the phrases have identical sense and reference.

In b the nominatives kavíḥ and hótā seem each appropriate to one part of the rest of the pāda: the poet to manmasā́dhanaḥ and the Hotar-priest to yájati. Re’s tr., with his trademark verbosity, makes this division of labor explicit.
