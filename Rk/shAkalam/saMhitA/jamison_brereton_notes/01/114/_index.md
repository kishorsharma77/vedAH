Rudra By RVic standards this hymn is almost laughably simple and elementary, very different from Kutsa’s usual products.

There is much repetition and chaining of vocabulary in this hymn: kṣayádvīra- is prominent at the beg. (1-3, + 10), with vīra- reprised in 3 and 8. See also śám 1, 2; aśyāma 2-3; sumatí 3, 4, 9 + sumnāyán 3, sumná 9, 10; ní hvayāmahe 4-5 [havāmahe 8]; námasā 2, 5 + námaḥ 11; tvéṣam 4-5; kapardín- 1, 5; mrḍ̥ á 2, 6, 10 + mrḍ̥ ayátama 9; toká- tánaya- 6, 8; havíḥ 3, havíṣmant- 8; rā́sva 6, 9; pitár marútām 6, 9; vrṇ̥ imahe 4, 9; āré 4, 10; śárma √yam 5, 10). The first 5 vss. are also marked by 1st pl. verbs.
