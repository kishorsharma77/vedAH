The opening of pāda c is identical to 2c. The rest of this hemistich presents a few problems. The phrase tánā yujā́is rendered variously. My translation is based on the observation that in almost every single instance yujā́follows an instr. in an expression meaning “with X as yoke-mate” (X may either be animate [e.g., I.8.4 tváyā yujā́] or inanimate [e.g., X.83.3 tápasā yujā́“with fervor as yokemate”]). In this case, I take the root noun tán- to refer to the Marut’s entire lineage, in other words their family heritage and their sibling connections to each other. The instr.

phrase sárvayā viśā́“with your whole clan” in the next vs. (5d) may convey the same meaning. Taking tánā as ‘lineage’ here also has the merit of allowing a semantic connection with tánāya in 7a.

I separate the two pādas (so also Re), in great part because of the position of nū́cid, which usually opens its clause (here after an extra-sentential voc. rúdrāsaḥ).

However, a tr. similar to Ge’s, “your might is never to be open to challenge,” would also be possible.
