103 (929)
Indra (1–3, 5–11), Br̥haspati (4), Āpva (12), Indra or  the Maruts (13)
Apratiratha Aindra
13 verses: triṣṭubh, except anuṣṭubh 13
A martial hymn, dense with expressions of overwhelming power and victorious might.  The early parts of the hymn present Indra as the unconquerable conqueror. Stylistically  this part is marked by repetition and especially by the chaining of key lexical items  from the end of one verse to the beginning of the next. Curiously, X.84, a hymn to  “Battle Fury,” also shows this type of concatenation, and so it may be that stitching  verses together in this way creates a sort of magically impenetrable verbal armor.
In the course of the hymn the focus shifts from exclusive concentration on Indra  to our warriors and the inspiration Indra’s model should provide for them to per form heroically in battle. Our men are first addressed already in the second half of  verse 2, but it is in verse 6 and then in verses 10–13 that the application of Indra’s  behavior to that of our men and the transference of his skills and courage to them  really come to the fore.
