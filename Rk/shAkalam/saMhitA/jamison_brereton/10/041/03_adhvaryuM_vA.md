Whether you are going to an Adhvaryu of good hands with honey in his  palms, or to an Agnidh of steadfast skill, a domestic leader,  
or to the soma-pressings of an inspired poet, from there drive here to  honey-drinking, o Aśvins.  
Kr̥ṣṇa Āṅgirasa is said to be the poet of the next three hymns (42–44), all dedicated  to Indra and showing clear verbal connections.
