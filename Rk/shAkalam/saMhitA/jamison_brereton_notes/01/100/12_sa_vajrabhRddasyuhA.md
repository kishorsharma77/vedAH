The hapax camrīṣá- is taken by the standard tr. as a personal name. This tactic may be safe, but it ignores the word’s similarity to several others, particularly the hapax camríṣ- in I.56.1, a word usually rendered as ‘ladle’. Old, ad I.56.1, makes the offhand suggestion that our camrīṣá- is related to camara- ‘yak’, a word not attested until the gṛhya sūtras. Although ‘yak’ might work in our passage, the gap in attestation and the morphological differences make this connection quite shaky.

More promising are several words found in the RV for soma cup/beaker: camasáand camū́-, as well as the root cam ‘sip, slurp’ (see Gotō 1987: 136). camrīṣá (and camríṣ-) may be secondarily built to a *cam-ra- derived from this root (for the suffixes -īṣá- and -íṣ- see AiG II.2.462-63 and 364-67 respectively) and thus derivationally parallel to cam-ū́- and cam-asá-. I therefore take camrīṣá- as belonging to the same semantic sphere as camasá- and camū́- and as the designation of a large cup or beaker. The problem that then arises is why Indra would be compared to such a thing; this aberrant simile may be responsible for the resistance to connecting camrīṣá- with the other cam- words. But this is only an apparent problem. The point of comparison is Indra’s vastness (śávasā), the capaciousness with which he encompasses the peoples and natural features of the world (see also 14ab). An exactly parallel image is found in I.61.9, where Indra is called “a reverberant tankard” (svarír ámatraḥ).
