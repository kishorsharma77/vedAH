When, yet again, the heaven-bound praisers, the Bhr̥gus, tendering  homage, invoke him—the Bhr̥gus, plundering (the fire from heaven),  churning it with piety—
Agni is lord of goods, the blazing one who is their holder—
then his dear coverings the wise one should seek to win—the wise one  should seek to win here.
