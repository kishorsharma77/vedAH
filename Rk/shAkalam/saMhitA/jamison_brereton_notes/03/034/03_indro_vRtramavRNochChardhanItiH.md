The first two pādas of this vs. are rhetorically parallel, consisting of an etymological figure of augmented verb plus some part of the object (vṛtrám avṛṇot a, māyínām amināt b), ending with a bv. formed with -nīti- ‘leading, control’.

This interpr. of vyàṃsa- follows Schmidt (KZ 78 [1963]); see EWA s.v. áṃsa-.

In the second half-verse the subject takes an odd turn: after mention of Indra’s iconic deed (besides the explicit mention of Vṛtra in a, see the echoes of the great Indra hymn I.32 in b māyínām amināt [I.32.4 māyínām ámināḥ prótá māyā́ḥ] and c áhan vyàṃsam [I.32.5 áhan … vyàṃsam]), there is an abrupt switch to Agni phraseology. The same phrase uśádhag váneṣu “burning at will in the woods” (?) is used of Agni in the Agni hymn III.6.7; cf. also uśádhag vánāni also of Agni in the Agni hymn VII.7.2. The final pāda concerns the appearance of visible entities from the night, which also better fits an Agni context. For this reason I see a syntactic break in the middle of pāda c and take uśádhag váneṣu with d, contra the standard tr.

On the curious and problematic word uśádhak- see Scar (197-99) at length.

On dhénā- ‘milk-stream’ see comm. ad I.2.3 and Schmidt (Gs. Nyberg).

Schmidt there suggests that the referent in this pāda is the dawns emerging out of the dark of the night. This occurs of course at the same time as the kindling of the ritual fire and would account for the shift in diction to Agni phraseology. This image can then be secondarily applied to Indra bringing the dawn cows out of the nocturnal darkness of the Vala cave.
