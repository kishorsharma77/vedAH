Though Gr and Lub take tiráḥ as the prepositional adverb, standard tr.

interpret it as the 2nd sg. injunctive to tiráti, which is surely the correct analysis.

There is a surprising disagreement among tr. as to what ácyutam ‘immovable’ should modify. I take it with dharúṇam on the basis of Savya’s I.52.2 dharúṇeṣv ácyutaḥ. I take rájaḥ as obj. of átiṣṭhipaḥ, despite the pāda boundary, since otherwise this causative aorist is left without an expressed object.
