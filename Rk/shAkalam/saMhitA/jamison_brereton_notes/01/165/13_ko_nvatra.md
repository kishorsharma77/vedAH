The reciprocal lexical harmony of sákhīn … sakhāyaḥ recalls that found in 11d sákhye sákhāyaḥ, but there is a small mystery: the voc. pl. sakhāyaḥ surely refers to the Maruts, but who are the plural expressed by sákhīn? We would expect a singular referring to Indra. It seems unlikely to be the priests plus/minus Indra because the speaker is a singular (note me in d, the sg. inter. prn. káḥ in the rhetorical question in pāda a, and the sg. poet in vs. 14). I take that speaker to be Agastya (contra the publ. tr., which identifies him as the narrator). Perhaps a pl. maiestatis for Indra? If návedā(ḥ) belongs to the s-stem návedas-, it should be nom. m. singular here, in disagreement with the plural subj. of bhūta. Gr’s solution is to set up a them.

stem náveda- for just this passage, which would allow a plural interpr. To avoid this ad hoc multiplication of stems, we can assume the same type of constructio ad sensum invoked for ánedyaḥ in the immed. preceding vs. (12b)(so Old), with the sg.

referring collectively to the Marut troop. Cf. also the parallel passage IV.23.4 devó bhuvan návedā ma ṛtā́nām, with a legitimate singular; the post-caesura portions of the pādas are identical. On the origin of návedas- from a false segmentation of -tana védas- see Schindler, Fs. Knobloch, 1985.
