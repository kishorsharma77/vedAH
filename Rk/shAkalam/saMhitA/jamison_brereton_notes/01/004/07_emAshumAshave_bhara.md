(JL) The b and c pādas both end with an adjective modifying the implicit object soma, a compound of the root √mad ‘exhilarate’ (the second time in its byform mand) and a noun expressing the personal object of the verb, but in exactly opposite order: nṛ-mā́dana- and mandayát-sakha-, what might be called a “compound chiasmus.” A less complex etymological figure is found at the beginning of the verse: āśúm āśáve.
