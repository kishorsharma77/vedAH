An abundance of good heroes, of good standing and well in advance,  desirable, unassailable by the demonic,
and all things of value might we acquire at this journey of yours, o you  whose goods are prize mares.
The next small collection of hymns (VIII.23–26) is attributed to Viśvamanas  Vaiyaśva, with hymns to Agni (VIII.23), Indra (VIII.24), Mitra and Varuṇa  (VIII.25), and the Aśvins and Vāyu (VIII.26). The names Vyaśva and its patro nymic Vaiyaśva occur several times in these hymns, as does the name of the patron  (Varo) Suṣāman, and the hymns are also characterized by the almost exclusive use  of the uṣṇih meter (8 8 12). See Oldenberg (1888: 211–13).
