The identity of the “seven” is unclear; ordinarily that number refers to rivers or priestly offices, but neither makes sense here. However, Ge (n. to 16a) points to seven enemies destroyed by Indra in X.49.8, 120.6.

Ge takes vibhu-mánt- (only here) as ‘die in dir einen Gebieter hatten’; this might be plausible, because Indra is characterized as vibhū́in 11 and so creatures associated with him might possess him as vibhú-. But the problem is that vibhú-/ū́- is only adjectival, as far as I can tell, and does not have the ‘lord, master’ meaning presupposed here. Though possessive -vant-/-mant- stems should be built to nouns, Debrunner (AiG II.2.877-78) allows for pleonastic use of the suffix with adjectives in this and a number of other cases.
