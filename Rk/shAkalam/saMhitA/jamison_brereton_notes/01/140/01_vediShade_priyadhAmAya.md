The referent of dhāsí- ordinarily ‘wellspring’ (see comm. I.62.3), which is identified here as Agni’s yóni- ‘womb’, is unclear. In VIII.43.7, 29 and III.7.3 (also perhaps III.7.1) the dhāsí- is the plants (=firewood) to be “eaten,” i.e., burned, by the fire, hence the source (‘wellspring’) of the fire’s growth. Since whatever it is here can be carried (prá bharā), firewood makes sense, and this interpr. is supported by the fact that the plants that Agni burns are an important theme in this hymn (vss. 2ab, 6-8). Though in I.122.13, a passage adduced by WG, I render dhāsí- as ‘gush’ (developing a different aspect of ‘wellspring, fountain’; cf. also VI.67.6), that sense does not work well here because it must be identified with the yóni- and capable of being carried.
