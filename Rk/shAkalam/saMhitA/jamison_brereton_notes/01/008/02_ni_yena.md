Incomplete sentence, with relative hanging off rayím ‘wealth’ in the previous verse. Two methods of fighting are contrasted: ‘fighting (-hatyā́-) by fist’ (muṣṭi-, my ‘bare-knuckled’) and ‘on horseback’ (árvatā). Although the two terms are grammatically parallel (instrs. muṣṭi-hatyáyā and árvatā), they are not semantically, since it’s the first member of the compound, muṣṭi- that corresponds to árvatā, and ‘fighting’ must be supplied with the second term. The verse shows overt signs of late grammatical features: esp. the -ai ending of the middle subjunctive ruṇádhāmahai (rather than -e), but also the longer -ā-stem instr. -áyā (rather than -ā́), though of course the latter is fairly well distributed throughout the RV.
