Before addressing the question of what pādas a and b have to do with each other thematically, we must first consider the small technical issue of the placement of utá at the beginning of pāda b. Since pāda a contains a participle (dádhānāḥ) and pāda b a main verb (sám añjan), it is unlikely that utá is conjoining the two pādas.

Instead, with Klein (DGRV I.396-97), I think it is probably conjoining this hemistich with the preceding vs., with utá displaced to the beginning of pāda b after the participial phrase in a. This is very reminiscent of III.31.21, in this same Indra series, where the same explanation accounts for a rightward displacment of ca into the beginning of the second pāda of the clause.

As indicated in the publ. intro., I think this vs. describes the role of the poets in the second creation. It fleshes out the laconic takṣata dyā́m “They crafted heaven” in 2b. But what are they depositing in pāda a, and why? The first question can be restated as -- what should be supplied with gúhyā? The most common nouns appearing with that adjective are nā́man- ‘name’ and padá- ‘traces, track’; either of these could work here because both can be used of the esoteric verbal production of the poets. “Secret names” would refer to the act of creation that involves dividing and naming the inchoate mass of material pre-creation; “secret traces” would refer to the esoteric poetry more generally. Here they seem to have pooled and deployed these secret elements, to use in their poetic ornamentation -- that is, in their detailed elaboration -- of the originally undifferentiated matter of the two worlds. Note that the participle is middle: it is their own names/traces that are in play.

In both Hymnes spéc. (1956) and EVP XVII (1969) Re tr. sám añjan as “ont consacré,” as an allusion to royal unction. The dat. kṣatrā́ya ‘for dominion’ makes this a tempting idea, though sám √añj is not a standard technical term in the royal consecration. I certainly think this is a secondary meaning of this pāda, but in keeping with the rest of the hymn, I think the primary meaning must be creation through poetic elaboration. Since royal consecration does in fact make the person in question a new entity, the king, it can be conceptualized as a creation as well.

The 2nd half-verse is more clearly concerned with creation. The root √mā ‘measure’ is of course regularly used in this connection, and as I said in the publ.

intro., the separation of the two worlds in d is a standard cosmogonic image. Ge’s interpr. of c is rather aberrant and in part dependent on a passage in the PB, and his interpr. has not become the standard. Because of the accent on mamiré, I have supplied ‘when’ with the first half of pāda c, though the accent may simply result from the adjacency of the two verbs mamiré and yemúḥ.

The verb in d, antáḥ … dhuḥ, is not a standard expression for ‘separate’ and in fact might be expected to mean ‘place between’. WG tr. in that way, supplying “Luftraum” (antárikṣa-): “Zwischen die beiden … (Welten) setzten sie (den Luftraum) …” This is a clever solution and it may be the original sense of the lexeme, which, however, I believe has evolved to mean, without an object, ‘place apart’, that is, separate by putting something in between.

I take dhā́yase as belonging to √dhā ‘suckle, nourish’, like the rest of the occurrences of this -as-stem. Re (EVP), Kü (395), and WG all follow this root assignment, but Ge and Re (Hymnes spéc.) take it to √dhā ‘place’: “damit sie (die Herrschaft) ausüben” and “pour qu’ils se tiennent stables,” respectively. The separation of the two worlds is often presented as a boon for humans, so the ‘nourish’ interpr. seems more fitting, and the usual analysis of dhā́yas- supports it.
