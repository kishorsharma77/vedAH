Pāda d must remain in the domain of hí in c, as shown by the accent on babhūvá, as is recognized by the standard tr.

The repetition of yūyám at the beginning of d is, I think, due not only to rhetoric but to the desire to make the ps./no. of babhūvá perfectly clear. The 2nd pl.

act. pf. is surely the least well attested form of the act. perfect system (save for 1st du.), and it also has a highly under-characterized ending (-a), which has the misfortune to be identical to the ending of the best attested form in the pf. system, the 3rd sg., as well as the less well attested 1st sg. (For the relative strengths of attestation, a glance at Macdonell’s Vedic Grammar §485 will suffice.) In most pf. paradigms it would be distinguished from those forms by ablaut grade (e.g., 1st sg. cakára, 3rd sg.

cakā́ra, 2nd pl. cakrá), but here, because the pf. of √bhū doesn't ablaut, only the accent separates it from 3rd (and 1st) sg. babhū́va. This may be another reason that it was kept syntactically in the realm of hí, to require it to have an accent. It’s worth noting that this is the only 2nd pl. pf. to √bhū in the RV.

dákṣa- is ordinarily a noun, ‘skill’, but in the publ. tr. I was persuaded by the standard tr. to render it as an adj. ‘skillful’ with vácas-. This phrase also occurs in VIII.86.1 and, with a different derivative of √vac, in X.113.9 dákṣebhir vacanébhiḥ.

In the latter I tr. as an adj. “with skillful words,” but in the former as two independent nouns “of skill and of speech.” I am uncertain which is correct. Re is quite stern: “dákṣa- est nécessairement adjectif ici et en plusieurs passages …: inutile de chercher à éviter ici l’emploi, avec Gr., emploi qui est le seul subsistant en skt cl.” The Classical Skt. usage is suggestive, but I am wary of the absolutist language of “nécessairement” and “inutile”: very few things in RVic interpr. are absolutely necessary. I would therefore allow an alt. tr. here: “you have become (the charioteers) of (our) skill and speech.” That vs. 9 contains a cmpd. containing the noun, pūtá-dakṣa- ‘of refined skill’, though modifying the gods, might support a ‘skill’ interpr. here, esp. as the ‘charioteer’ motif is found there as well.
