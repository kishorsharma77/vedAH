Tvaṣṭar as referent of this verse is not so clear as some of the others, but in his capacity as “shaper” and with his secondary association with the root √takṣ ‘hew, carve, build’, it makes sense for him to have the axe as his emblem. The pairing with the next verse, clearly of Indra, may also make sense, since by many accounts Tvaṣṭar is Indra’s father. Oberlies (Relig. I.336) claims that this vs. has to do with battles over settling places, which must first be made habitable by felling and burning trees, but I think this reads too much into the passage.
