Both Old (ZDMG 55.320 and Noten) and Ge (fld. by Klein DGRV II.92- 93) strongly argue that paprā́tha belongs to √prath ‘spread’, not √prā ‘fill’, to which Gr assigns it. I find their insistence puzzling. On their side, ví √prath is a fairly common lexeme, used often of the earth, whereas ví is rare to non-existent with √prā.

But the actual verb form is wrong for all sorts of reasons. First, the indic. pf. of √prath is otherwise only middle, but this would be act. Second, the root √prath  never otherwise has vṛddhi forms, but the root syllable here is prāth. Then, if it is a 3rd sg. (so Ge “Er breitete …”), it opens a cosmogonic sequence of 2nd sg. expressions, and such formulaic cosmogonies tend to be consistent in ps. and no. (though see 9cd below). Recognizing this last problem, Old suggests it’s a 2nd sg., standing for

*paprath-tha > *paprattha, with the heavy syllable *atth redistributing metrical
weight [not his terminology] to āth. This type of change would not be unusual in Middle Indic, but it would have been useful to provide parallel examples in Rig Veda.

Moreover, since √prath is a seṭ root, we should in any case expect a 2nd sg.

*paprathitha. The only factor on their side of the ledger is the preverb, and since our
poet no doubt playfully recognized that the form would evoke √prath, it is not surprising that he would import the preverb. Unambiguous perfect forms to √prā ‘fill’ frequently take the earth as obj. as here (e.g., III.30.11 índra ā́paprau pṛthivīm utá dyā́m), which makes the Old/Ge intransigence all the more surprising.

In pāda a máhi dáṃsaḥ interrupts the obj. phrase kṣā́m … urvī́m. Ge’s nominal phrase “— ein grosses Meisterstück—” is less disruptive than my nominal clause “great is your wondrous skill,” and might be preferable on those grounds.
