ā́ghṛṇi- is an epithet exclusive to Pūṣan. On the word, see comm. ad VI.53.3.

That Pūṣan is addressed in the 2nd ps. here, while the refrain remains in the 3rd ps., might be taken as evidence for Ober’s identification of Soma as the subject of the refrain - since soma is in the 3rd ps. in this vs. However, refrains tend to operate in syntactic independence from their vss., and, as I argued above, once the refrain is set, it is unlikely to change referents.
