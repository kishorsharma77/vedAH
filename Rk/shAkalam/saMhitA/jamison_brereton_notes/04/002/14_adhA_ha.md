The vs. modulates from the 1st pl. of the subordinate clause in the first hemistich (yád vayám … cakṛmā́) to the 3rd pl. of the main clause of d (yemuḥ sudhyàḥ) via the simile in c (ráthaṃ ná krántaḥ). The simile could belong either to the subord. cl. or the main cl. and is grammatically and semantically appropriate to either the 1st or the 3rd ps. subject of either.

On ṛtám āśuṣānā́ḥ see comm. ad IV.1.13.
