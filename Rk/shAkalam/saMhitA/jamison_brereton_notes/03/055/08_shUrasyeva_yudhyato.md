This verse contains quite oblique phraseology. The first half-verse appears to describe the increasingly aggressive ritual fire after it has been kindled. I take āyát as the neut. pres. part. to √i + ā́‘come’, substantivized to mean ‘approach, advent’, and I supply a gen. ‘of him’, which is parallel to the gen. simile in pāda a. The growing fire is compared to a fighter involved in close combat. I have rendered pratīcī́nam, lit. ‘turned outward, opposite, face to face’, as the slangy ‘right in your face’ to convey the belligerent nearness of the fire’s approach.

The c pāda is likewise hard to interpret. As Ge notes, the lexeme antár √car is generally used for the journey between earth and heaven undertaken by Agni, the messenger or “go-between” for the earthly and heavenly realms. This usage is found in fact in the very next vs., 9b, where Agni is clearly the subject and is journeying through the space between heaven and earth -- as well as in numerous other passages (see esp. X.4.2). As Ge also points out, in I.173.3 it is ‘Speech’ (vā́k) who plays this role. Similarly, in our passage ‘thought’ (matí-) -- i.e., as often, thought that has taken shape as ritual speech -- is the subject and undertakes the role of messenger. As for the tribute of the cow (niṣṣídhaṃ góḥ), with Ge I take this as referring to the bovine product that serves as oblation, namely ghee. Thus, ritual speech makes the swift journey to the gods in heaven from the ritual ground, bringing the news of the oblation or serving as its envoy. On niṣṣídh- see comm. ad III.51.5.
