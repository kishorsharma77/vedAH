title = "06"

The referent changes from 2nd ps. (vs. 5) to 3rd (vs. 6), although this is not clear until the 3rd sg. verbs in the 2nd hemistich.

“On both sides” (ubhayátaḥ) probably reflects the double reference just noted: the ritual and the cosmic, or the earthly and the heavenly. See Ge n. 6ab.

I read yádī as yád ī (with enclitic prn.), since “if” does not work well here.
