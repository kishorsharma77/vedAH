Despite the hemistich boundary and the tr. of Ge/Re, I take grā́vṇā in c with vádan, immediately preceding it in b, because the grā́van- regularly “speaks” elsewhere (cf. VIII.34.2, X.36.4 grā́vā vádan, V.37.2 grā́vāṇaḥ … vádanti). Ge and Re need to supply material in order to construe it with pāda c.
