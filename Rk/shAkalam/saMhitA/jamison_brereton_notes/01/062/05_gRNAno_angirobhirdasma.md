The instrumentals in b (uṣásā sū́ryeṇa góbhiḥ) are not parallel with áṅgirobhiḥ in a. The Aṅgirases there are the agents of the passively used participle gṛṇānáḥ (and also potentially instrumental of accompaniment with the main verb, as Indra’s helpers: “along with the A’s you uncovered…”). The instrumentals in b are the additional elements that Indra uncovered.

ándhaḥ is a potential pun, as a homophone meaning both ‘blind darkness’ and ‘soma stalk’. The former is surely the first reading in this treatment of the Vala myth, with the cave a black hole, as it were. So Ge, Re, WG. But soma is never far from Indra’s mind, and the cosmogonic deeds with which he is credited in the second hemistich are often performed under the influence of soma. Schmidt (p. 164) favors ‘(Soma-)Flut’, following Bergaigne and Lüders.
