The vs. (and hymn) opens cleverly: the 1st two words are víśvo devásya, and until we encounter the genitive ending on the 2nd word, we expect the “every god” that would be appropriate to an All God hymn. Instead, the 2nd pāda opens with the real referent of víśvaḥ, namely the polar opposite of ‘god’, mártaḥ ‘mortal’.

On iṣudhyati see comm. ad I.128.6 and my forthcoming article “Vedic iṣudhyáand Old Avestan išud-, išūidiia-: The Aim of Praise.” In the course of re-examining the members of this word family, I have somewhat changed my interpr. of this passage. In the publ. tr. I take “wealth” as the target or goal of iṣudhyati ‘aims at’; however, insofar as the Vedic and Avestan verbs express the target, it is in the acc. (see VIII.69.2), and it is the divine recipient of praise, not the desired countergift to the praise. The Pp. interpr. rāyá as dat. rāyé, which is neither the desired case nor the desired goal. It would be possible to read it as acc. pl. rāyáḥ ‘riches’, which could be an acc. goal (“everyone desires riches”), but since this still deviates from the preferred expression with iṣudhyá-, I now prefer to supply “god Leader” as the goal, with dat. rāyé expression what we hope for in return: “Everyone aims (praise) (at god Leader) for wealth.” Pādas b and d both contain a 3rd sg. mid. to √vṛ ‘choose’, in the same metrical position and with the same metrical shape: root aor. vurīta and 9th cl. pres. vṛṇīta.

The first is clearly an optative, though it has a somewhat unexpected shape and is quite rare (only twice in the RV); its unusual root syllable (vur < *uṛ̯H; expect *ur as in part. urāṇá-) is found elsewhere only in hotṛ-vū́rya- (2x, with pre-C outcome).

The second, vṛṇīta, is formally ambiguous: it can be an optative parallel to vurīta, as I have taken it (so also at least Re), or simply an injunctive. I would suggest that the poet first deploys the rare but unambiguously optative vurīta to set the modal tone and then uses the more common vṛṇīta as its morphological parallel. But it would of course be possible to argue that the poet wishes to contrast the two modalities; so I interpr. Ge.
