The second clause of pāda a, áditir vītáye naḥ, is underspecified and has been variously interpr. Since vītáye is frequently used in stereotyped passages of gods ‘pursuing’ the oblation, often with a verb of motion, I supply this context here. For parallels, cf., e.g., VIII.20.10 havyā́no vītáye gata.

The nom. pl. demon. eté is pāda-final, which seems an odd position for such a pronoun. But a glance at Lub’s Concordance shows that eté is found in just that place fairly commonly -- e.g., in the next hymn, V.60.5a.
