This vs. continues the theme of the impious foe, though the divine ally the poet calls on to destroy the foe has changed from Bṛhaspati to the Maruts. Here (pāda a) the enemy chooses to praise demons (rakṣásaḥ) when gods (deva-) are being invited to the ritual and (c) mocks the ritual labor of the devotee. Because of the strong association of sweat with ritual labor in the RV (see my “Avestan xšuuīd: A Relic of Indo-Iranian Ritual Vocabulary,” Bulletin of the Asia Institute 25 [2011 (2015),] and for √śam ‘labor’ with √svid ‘sweat’ I.86.8), I assume that the enemy himself is engaging in (what we hope will be fruitless) ritual in pāda d, perhaps in service of the demons, not the gods (cf. pāda a). In post-RVic texts the Asuras would probably serve as the polar opposition to the gods, not the Rakṣasas, an indirect piece of evidence for the well-known fact that the Asura-Deva opposition almost entirely postdates the RV.

In the publ. tr. óhate in pāda a is tr. as an indicative (‘whoever lauds’), but it should really be a subjunctive (“whoever will laud”), both on the basis of the morphology (it belongs to a root pres., whose 3rd plural is also óhate) and of the parallel subjunctives in the passage, cd yáḥ … nindāt, … karate.
