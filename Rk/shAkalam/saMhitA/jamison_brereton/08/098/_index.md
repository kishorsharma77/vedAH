Indra
Nr̥medha  Āngirasa ̇
12 verses: uṣṇih, except kakubh 7, 10–11, puraüṣṇih 9, 12, arranged in trcas. ̥
Although the hymn is composed in three different meters, each of the three meters  consists of two pādas of eight syllables and one of twelve, just differently arranged,  so that the hymn is more formally unified than the bare metrical synopsis suggests.  It is arranged in tr̥cas, but not all the tr̥cas show unity of form or content. The  second tr̥ca (vss. 4–6) has a four-syllable refrain, and each verse of the last (vss.  10–12) begins with a form of “you” and contains the vocative “you of a hundred  resolves,” though not always in the same position. Otherwise there are no clear  formal marks.
The hymn begins (vs. 1) with an exhortation to the ritualists to sing to Indra, and  the second tr̥ca begins (vs. 4) with a complementary request to Indra to come to the  sacrifice, but most of the rest of the first six verses is devoted to generalized praise  of Indra. In the third tr̥ca (vss. 7–9) the ritualists mobilize their verbal resources to  strengthen Indra and bring him to the sacrifice, and in the last tr̥ca (vss. 10–12), as  usual, the poet then states our requests, here for battle strength and fighting heroes  rather than wealth.
