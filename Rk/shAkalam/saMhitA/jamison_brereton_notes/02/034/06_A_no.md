In pāda a the grammatical problem is svàr (to be read as a monosyllable, [almost] uniquely in the RV). Gr identifies it as an acc., Macd (followed implicitly by Doniger and Maurer) as an endingless loc., sim. Re. However, the phraseology, esp.

the accented asyá (which identifies asyá as an adjectival demon., not a pronoun) and the placement of ca (áśvasyā́tra jánimāsyá ca svàḥ, invite, indeed almost impose, a genitive interpr. Ge achieves this by pronouncing svàr indeclinable (n. 6a). However, it is possible to see it as an archaic genitive with zero-grade ending *-s, as in Aves.

xuuə̄ṇg < *sh2uuen̯ -s, but with the -r of the nom./acc. leveled into the oblique. See Klein DGRV I.96, WG.

The identity of the two entities born must also be sorted out. It is possible that the horse is just a horse, since origin in the water is an equine characteristic (see, e.g., I.163.1 adduced by Ge). But it seems likely that the carefully balanced áśvasya … asyá ca svàḥ refers to two contrasted entities, quite likely the fire (Agni) and the sun (Sūrya). The obvious way to get that is for the horse to represent fire/Agni and “this sun” the sun, but I wonder if there isn’t a clever reversal: the “horse” is the sun and “this sun here” is Agni.

In b the addressee of the impv. pāhi is not identified, though the default assumption would be Apām Napāt. It is striking that this is the only instance of the 2nd ps. in this entire hymn.

The “raw” (āmá-) fortifications are convincingly explained by Ge as built from unfired brick. They need not (and in my opinion should not) be further interpreted as cloud citadels (so Macd, fld. by Maurer and, in part, Doniger).

Specifying that the fortifications be unfired is a cute reversal if Agni is supposed to be in residence there. It is also possible, if Apām Napāt is at issue, that the reference is to his residence in the waters, would would most definitely be uncooked/unfired. It is also of course difficult in this post-Lévi-Strauss age not to put his conceptual spin on the term “raw,” though exactly how this concept would pertain to this passage is unclear: perhaps it refers to a place and a society so far away (paráḥ) from Ārya civilization that it counts as “raw” to Ārya “cooked.”
