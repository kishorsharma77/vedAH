The locatival inf. gṛṇīṣáṇi occurs only here and in VIII.12.19. Curiously, in both passages it is construed with āmreḍitas: here priyám-priyam … átithim (matching agním-agnim in pāda a), in VIII.12.19 deváṃ-devam … índram-indram. I don’t quite know what to do with this fact. Keydana (p. 178) takes it as a “Matrixinfinitiv” functionally equivalent to an imperative, pointing to impv.

duvasyata in pāda a. However, it would also be possible to interpret it as I do, with duvasyata the main verb of both pādas and the infinitive an adverbial adjunct to both pādas. I would change the tr. of the āmreḍitas, however, to one more in harmony with that in VIII.12.19: “Time after time do friendly service to the fire with a kindling stick, time after time to your dear guest, in hymning (him).” The morphology of gṛṇīṣáṇi is of course unusual, though it belong with the small group of RV -san-i locatival infinitives, some of which (cf. esp. upastṛṇīṣáṇi, which, however, I now consider to be based on gṛṇīṣáṇi; see comm. ad VI.44.6) are built to already derived verbal stems (see AiG II.2.924-25). In this passage it phonologically echoes ghṛṇé and tatṛṣāṇáḥ in the preceding vs. (5d), and in the next vs. (which also belongs to the next tṛca) pāda-final gṛṇe, which is also of course etymologically related.
