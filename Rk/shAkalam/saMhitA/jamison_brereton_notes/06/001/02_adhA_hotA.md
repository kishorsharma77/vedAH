Pāda b ends with one of the rare examples of non-concessive sán, nom. sg. m.

pres. part. to √as. Its presence here may be due to an effort at metrical adjustment.

The stem īḍi ya- is almost invariably read distracted as here, and it is extremely common in pāda-final position. This is fine for dimeter meter and for Jagatī, but the distracted stem obviously doesn’t fit a Triṣṭubh cadence. The addition of monosyllabic sán allows such a cadence here. Note also that sán rhymes with gman, which closes the next two hemistichs (2d, 3b). The only ex. of a non-distracted form of ī́ḍya- (save for a lone Xth Maṇḍala gen. sg.) is found likewise in a Triṣṭubh cadence in IV.24.2 sá vṛtrahátye hávyaḥ sá ī́ḍyaḥ, where a non-distracted ī́ḍyaḥ sits uncomfortably after a distracted hávi yaḥ. So, two different solutions to the problem of fitting ī́ḍya- into a Triṣṭubh cadence.

Ge suggests that the second hemistich “spielt auf Agni’s Flucht ins Wasser an.” I don’t myself see this, and I do not know what his evidence is, beyond ánu gman ‘have followed’. In this ritual context, the “god-seeking men” “have followed Agni first,” because he is the conduit of their offerings to the gods and the divinity who is installed in their own houses. They must go through him, as it were, to reach the gods.

The first hemistich emphasizes this ritual connection: Agni “sits down” (that is, is installed) as Hotar and superior sacrificer, and the place where he is installed is specified as “the footprint of refreshment” (iḷás padé), a kenning for the ritual ground (see, for a similar installation scenario, I.128.1 and II.10.1).

On mahó rāyé see comm. ad IV.31.11. The interp. of the rest of pāda d is uncertain, primarily because of the multiply ambiguous citáya- stem. The pāda most resembles V.15.5 mahó rāyé citáyann átrim aspah, rendered by Ge as “du hast jetzt zu grossem Reichtum dich offenbarend dem Atri (aus der Not) herausgeholfen” (though in our passage here he takes citáyantaḥ as “aufmerksam,” a completely different sense of citáya-) and in the publ. tr. (JPB) as “…then appearing greatly for wealth, you have rescued Atri.” My publ. tr. here (“distinguishing themselves”) is closest to Ge’s tr. of V.15.5, though I think it adds a crucial element. The point must (or at least may) be that the men seek to make especially conspicuous offerings to the gods, via Agni, for the sake of acquiring the wealth that accrues to the successful sacrificer. The apparent reflexive tr. ‘distinguish oneself’ is really just an extension of the common value of citáya- ‘appear’/ ‘appear (good), be conspicuous’. Re’s “fixant leur pensée sur la richesse (pour l'atteindre) grandement” is an extension of Ge’s “attentive” sense, but I think he has extended too far.
