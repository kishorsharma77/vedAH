The med. root pres. part. cákṣāṇa- cmpded with ví is found only here. By contrast the bahuvrīhi vicakṣaṇá- ‘having a wide gaze, wide-gazing’ occurs nearly 20x in Maṇḍala IX alone (including nearby IX.37.2). The two words are distinguished only by the length of the penultimate syllable (and accent). The cmpd is found almost entirely pāda-final (either in Gāyatrī or in Jāgatī), whereas the part. here opens the pāda. However, nothing would prevent vicakṣaṇáḥ from taking that position, as it indeed does in IX.97.2 (Triṣṭubh), so the distribution cannot be purely metrical. See also Re.
