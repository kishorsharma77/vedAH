This vs. continues with the description of violent Agni.

Pāda d has caesura after 3; there are two other exx. of this metrical irregularity in the hymn, 6b and 8b, both of which have bad cadences as well. Here the early caesura might be calling attention to the extreme alliteration of the pāda: dravír ná drāvayati dā́ru dhákṣat. The same is not true of the others.

The 3rd sg. bhásat is most likely a subj. to a root aor.; see Gotō 82.

The hapax yamasāná-, an apparent participle to a supposed “Doppelstamm” to √yam, does not fit the pattern of most of the other -asāná- stems, on which see comm. ad IV.3.6 -- in that it neither falls into the semantic sphere of violent activity nor has an associated s-stem. Note here, however, that rabhasāná-, which meets both criteria, is found in the last vs. of this hymn (8d) and could have provided a model for this formation. I also wonder if yamasāná- is not a pseudo-cmpd. of yáma- ‘bridle’ (e.g., V.61.2) and √sā ‘bind’, as if with a middle part. of the root aor. asāt, etc.

(viṣā́ṇa- in V.44.1, identified as a part. by Gr., is better taken as an -ana- nom. to the same root [<sā́-ana-]; cf. AiG II.2.193). Hence, ‘being bound to the bridle’. Needless to say, this would not be well formed by standard Vedic compounding rules, but is not completely out of the question as a nonce inspired by rabhasāná-, itself a nonce.

Note also the phonological figure (yam)asāná āsā́. The simile in c, vijéhamānaḥ paraśúr ná jihvā́m, has been variously interpr. I take the frame to be (agníḥ) … jihvā́m -- that is, the tongue is Agni’s, as usual, and refers to his flame(s). As for the comparandum, the ax -- I assume that its tongue is its blade, extending from the handle as a tongue does from a mouth. The blade might be found in the next vs. in dhā́rā (5b). See VI.2.7-8, where I argue that a word missing from vs. 7 is found or gestured toward in the following vs. The hapax dravíḥ in the next pāda is universally taken as a nom. sg. masc. to an i-stem draví- meaning ‘smelter’ (so Gr, etc., and cf. AiG II.2.297) or ‘cutter’ (so Hoffmann, Aufs. 420, to √drū ‘cut’, rather than √dru ‘run’). But agent nouns in simple -í-, though they do exist (see AiG II.2.296-97), are not exactly thick upon the ground. I suggest instead that it is a neut. -ís-stem like havís- ‘oblation’, sarpís- ‘melted butter’ (on this type, including those built to aniṭ roots, see AiG II.2.364-67).

It would then be a cognate object to drāvayati in the simile and, on the one hand, be a more likely substance to be caused to run than wood (dā́ru) and, on the other, refer to the parts of wood that really do ‘run’, like sap. It might be worth noting that the much later cvi formation dravī-bhū (etc.) means ‘become liquid, liquefy’. (This of course has nothing to do with the -í- in dravíḥ, but does show that ‘run’ is used of liquids, a reasonably widespread semantic extension -- e.g., in English.) The standard tr. take dā́ru as the obj. of dhákṣat ‘burning’, rather than of drāvayati. This is, of course, the safer course. But cf. V.41.10 ní riṇāti vánā “he liquefies the trees” (also of Agni), V.58.6 riṇaté vánāni “the trees dissolve,” both with the root √ri ‘flow’.
