As noted in the publ. intro. this vs. forms a ring with vs. 1 (so already Ge n.

5cd). Note also that vy àbravīd vayúnā … “he has declared the (ritual) patterns …” recalls vayúnā návādhita “he has established the new (ritual) patterns” in the preceding hymn (I.144.5).

The īm of pāda has no function, that is, no possible accusative reading. See īm in I.144.3 (though that had a possible explanation).

Because of the position of hí in d, contra the standard tr. I do not think that agnír vidvā́n should be construed with this last part of the verse (ṛtacíd dhí satyáḥ), despite the pāda break that seems to put them together. Rather the hí clause explains why Agni is knowledgeable and can provide the answers requested so forcefully at the beginning of the hymn.
