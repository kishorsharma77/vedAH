The full realization of the dual dvandva mitrā́-váruṇā- as two independent dual genitives separated by a pāda-break and several words -- mitráyoḥ … váruṇayoḥ

-- is a fine demonstration of the reality of this type of cmpd. in the Sprachgefühl.

I do not understand the pāda-final ā́(m̐). Generally in this position ā́follows an abl., reinforcing the meaning “von … her” (see Gr. col. 169), or a loc. But mitráyoḥ is of course not an abl., and, though it could grammatically be a loc., by sense it can only be a gen. It seems pleonastic -- perhaps added to allow a Triṣṭubh cadence.
