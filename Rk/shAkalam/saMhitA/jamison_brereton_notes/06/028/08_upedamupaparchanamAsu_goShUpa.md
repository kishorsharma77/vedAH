The usual tr. of this vs. tend towards the euphemistic -- e.g., Ge “Dieses Befrüchtungsmittel soll … sich fruchtbar zeigen”; Kulikov (-ya-pres., 153 with nn.

373, 374) “Let this increase increase in these cows.” But √pṛc means ‘fill, engorge, mingle’, and with úpa, the preverb of intimacy, it takes on a distinctly sexual sense. I take it as ‘inseminate’ in this passage, especially because of the bull’s semen in c.

See disc. also ad I.40.9. Moreover, the -ana-suffix on upapárcana- is one that ordinarily signals a transitive sense and often has a close connection to a transitive - áya-formation (though not in this case). Unlike the standard tr. I take pāda a as a nominal sentence and pṛcyatām in b as an impersonal. In my interpr. upapárcana- is the ‘inseminator’ -- either the bull or the bull’s penis or semen, whose match is found in the hyper-virile Indra in d. My interpr. requires that that the two locc. in the 2nd hemistich (rétasi, vīryè) have a different usage and appear in different clauses from góṣu in b.
