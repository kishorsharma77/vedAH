Indra  
Madhuchandas Vaiśvāmitra  
10 verses: gāyatrī  
The “message” of this hymn is the standard one: Indra is urged to drink of our  soma and enjoy our praise songs and in return to provide us with the usual good  things. This relation of reciprocity is nicely conveyed stylistically by complementary  paired repetitions. For example, in verse 2 Indra is to be “sent surging” to the soma  (2a), while the same verb is to be supplied for the soma’s movement to Indra (2b).  Though this verb √sr̥j is an unusual choice to describe Indra’s locomotion, it is a  standard idiom applied to soma’s progress, especially in the Soma Maṇḍala (IX).  (See here also the songs sent surging in verse 4.) Similarly “spur on” in verses 5–6  with “us” once as goal (vs. 5) and once as direct object (vs. 6), and verse 10 where  both Indra and the chant directed to him are characterized as “lofty,” after two  occurrences of “lofty” applied to fame (vss. 7–8).  
For readers interested in comparative Indo-European poetics, the most nota ble feature of the hymn is an instance of the famous, but relatively rare, formula  “imperishable fame” (śrávaḥ... ákṣitam) in verse 7, where the two words are found  in separate pādas (b and c). The resonance of this formula and the concept behind  it may account for the near-exact repetition of the “place fame in us” expression in  verses 7–8.
