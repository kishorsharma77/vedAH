Kü (477-80) discusses the stem vāvaś- at length, rejecting the usual connection with √vaś ‘desire, want’ and assigning it instead to √vāś ‘bellow’. (WG follow this interpr. in our passage; Lub still assigns this form to √vaś.) Kü’s morphological arguments -- lack of u-redupl. and of root ablaut -- are strong.

However, although I would concede that the form was derivationally original only to √vāś, I would argue that once a stem vāvaś-, built to √vāś ‘bellow’, became established, it was available to “migrate” to √vaś ‘desire’, especially because the shortening of the root syllable in this metrically driven formation makes the form look more like √vaś than √vāś. Although the meanings of the two roots might seem so far apart that it would be hard to confuse one for the other, in fact the usual context of √vāś forms narrows the semantic gap considerably: cattle bellow because they want something. Kü allows for the possibility of semantic overlap as well.
