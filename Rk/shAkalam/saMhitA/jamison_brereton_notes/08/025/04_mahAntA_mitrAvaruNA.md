This is a particularly good passage to demonstrate that the unending rivalry between the two opposed groups Devas and Asuras so characteristic of middle Vedic literature cannot be backprojected into the core RV, since Mitra and Varuṇa are called simultaneously devā́v ásurā.

The phrase ‘grandson of strength’ (śávaso nápāt-) is used a number of times of the Ṛbhus (I.161.14, IV.34.6, 35.1, 8, 37.4) and only here of other divinities. It seems based on the more common śávasas páti- (I.131.4, IV.47.3, V.6.9, etc.), with (ná)pāt- echoing pát(i-). It also evokes semantically the phrase śávasaḥ sūnú- (IV.21.1, 37.4) / putrá- (VIII.90.2, 92.14), ‘son/child of strength’.
