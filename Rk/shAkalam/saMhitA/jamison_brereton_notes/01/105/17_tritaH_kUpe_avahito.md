This verse, which provides Ge with his “Trita im Brunnen” interpretation, does not seem to me to fit into the rest of the hymn, though Trita is found in 9cd in a context much more in harmony with the rest. In the next hymn, I.106.6, it’s Kutsa the poet who find himself in the same plight and calls upon Indra for help. The situation fits I.106 much better than I.105, and I wonder if it has been adapted from I.106.
