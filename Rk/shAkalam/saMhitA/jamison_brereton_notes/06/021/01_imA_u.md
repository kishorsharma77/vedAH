As with hemistich initial #śataíḥ … #vadhaíḥ in VI.20.4 in the immediately preceding hymn, I take #imā́ḥ … #dhíyaḥ as a “vertical” NP, “these insights.” Their positioning allows them to get out of the way of the intense etym. figure in b: hávyam … hávyā havante. This figure is complicated by the fact that hávya- is used in two slightly different senses, controlled by slightly different constructions of the verb √hū / hvā. Although the normal object of this verb is a god or other being called upon, very occasionally it can take the call itself as object (see comm. ad IV.23.3), and of course derivatives like háva(na)- express the call itself. In our passage havante ‘they invoke’ takes the usual type of object, namely Indra here, who is qualified by the gerundive hávya- ‘to be invoked’. But the insights (dhíyaḥ) themselves are also so qualified; here hávyāḥ must mean not ‘to be invoked’, but ‘to be called [=spoken]’. In order to keep the vocabulary constant, I have tr. ‘deserving to invoke’, in contrast to ‘deserving to be invoked’ applied to Indra.

The vertical NP just discussed unbalances syntactic constituency, and, unusually, the hemistich boundary cannot be respected.

In d most take īyate to √yā / ī ‘implore, beg’; so, e.g., Ge “… wird … erbeten” (likewise Lub, Kulikov, -ya-presents 495). I assign it rather to ‘speeds’, though either is possible.
