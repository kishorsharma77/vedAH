The usually idiomatic ā́pavasva lacks the usual acc. object (“bring [X] by purifying yourself”). Perhaps the ā́anticipates the ā́in c, in the idiom ā́… viśa ‘enter’.

The question in b are whether the two datives mahé … nṛcákṣase belong together and what the referent(s) is/are. Ge takes them together and identifies the referent as Indra, who appears by name in the next pāda, which would support Ge’s solution. However, as Re points out, nṛcákṣas- is never used of Indra, but generally of Agni or Soma. Re himself separates the datives, supplying ráṇe with mahé from the beginning of the tṛca (13a) and identifying the referent of nṛcákṣase as “le dieu Soma.” Although the first choice seems possible and even reasonable, the second is awkward: it seems odd to order Soma to purify himself for himself, even if the addressee is the substance soma (which shouldn’t actually have such agency) as distinct from the god. Given that the next tṛca but one (vss. 19-21) is addressed to Agni, that god seems a more likely choice. Re’s motivation in separating the two datives in b seems to be to wring the three functions out of the vs. (or, I gather, ab), but I don’t see how they would match up. In any case, a modified tr. à la Re, without reference to the three functions, is conceivable: “… for the quest for cattle, for great (joy), for the one of manly eye [=Agni].”
