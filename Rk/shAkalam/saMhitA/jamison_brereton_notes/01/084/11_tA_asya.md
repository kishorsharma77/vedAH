This verse contains another clue that the Maruts are the underlying referent.

The fem. subjects are identified as pṛ́śnayaḥ ‘dappled’, but pṛ́śni- is also the name of the Maruts’ mother. They would be called Pṛśnis here, just as they are regularly called Rudras, after their father Rudra. Note the phonetic figure pr̥śanāyúvaḥ ... pṛ́śnayaḥ.
