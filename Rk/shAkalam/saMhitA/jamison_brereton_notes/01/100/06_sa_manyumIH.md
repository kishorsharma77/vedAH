The general opinion is that samádana- is simply an extension of samád- ‘battle’; Mayrhofer (EWA s.v. samád-) suggests that it’s a blend of samád- and samáraṇa- ‘clash, battle’. I consider it rather a blend (with suffixal extension) of samád- and máda- ‘exhilaration, elation’, hence ‘battle-elation’ or, in Re’s felicitous tr. ‘l'ivresse-du-combat’. In a nicely balanced expression, just as Indra reduces the battle-fury of the enemy (manyu-mī́ḥ) he raises the battle-elation of those fighting with him. This notion is continued in the next verse, where in pāda a the Maruts cause Indra to enjoy the battle.

Ge and Re tr. sanat as a modal here (but not the repeated examples in vs. 18).

The form of course cannot be a subjunctive, given the augmented thematic forms that belong to this paradigm (ásanat, etc.), and though injunctives can sometimes be modal, there is no contextual reason for such an interpretation.
