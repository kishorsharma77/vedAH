Here the singer of vs. 3 seems to be convinced by Indra’s assertions in vss. 4-5 and promises a proper recital of Indra’s deeds, in contrast to the conditional praise of vs. 3.

I take pā́rāvatam in c as a vṛddhi adjective derived from parāvát- ‘distance’, rather than as a PN as Ge does (flg. Sāy, followed tentatively by Mayrhofer, Personennamen s.v.). As an adj. it works nicely with purusambhṛtám ‘brought together by many’, and there is no other mention of human opponents in this hymn.
