Agni
Iṣa Ātreya
7 verses: jagatī
The poet begins each verse with the object phrase tvā́m agne “you, o Agni,” except  verse 5, which subtly breaks the pattern by beginning tvám agne, with the nomina tive subject pronoun instead of the accusative. Thematically the hymn emphasizes  the roles of Agni as the fire of the household, of the clan, and of the clans col lectively. The poet remembers that the ancestors kindled Agni (vss. 1–2), that their  descendants, the present clans, continue to do so now (vs. 3), and that through Agni  they gain sustenance (vs. 5).
