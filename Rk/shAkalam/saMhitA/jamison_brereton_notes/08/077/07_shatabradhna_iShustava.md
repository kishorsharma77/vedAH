bradhná- is otherwise a color term (‘coppery, ruddy’) or a substance characterized by that color (soma, in nearby VIII.69.7), but in this hapax bahuvrīhi, śatá-bradhna- it must refer to something capable of being counted, hence my ‘ruddy glints’. Gr’s ‘hundert Metallspitzen habend’, Ge’s ‘mit hundert Spitzen’ seem to stray too far from the color term. The appearance of this word here may be owing to its phonological similarity to bundá-.
