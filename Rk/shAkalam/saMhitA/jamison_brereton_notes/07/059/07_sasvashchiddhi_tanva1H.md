I take pāda a as a nominal clause separate from b, with predicated pres. part.

śúmbhamānāḥ. The hemistich cannot form a single clause because apaptan in b is unaccented despite the hí in pāda a. I take the sense of the first pāda to be that storms come out of nowhere, fully beautified as it were, so the beautification must have been done “in secret” (sasvár). The dark-backed geese of b are the storm clouds. The next hymn, dedicated to Mitra and Varuṇa, has a similarly structured vs., VII.60.10 sasváś cid dhí sámṛtis tveṣy èṣām apīcyèna sáhasā sáhante “Because their fiery attack is even in secret and they are strong with hidden strength …” (JPB tr.). In that vs. the finite verb in b, sáhante, is accented and therefore falls under the domain of hí in pāda a.
