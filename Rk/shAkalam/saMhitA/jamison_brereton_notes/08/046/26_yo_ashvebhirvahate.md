This verse gives the impression of being constructed from random constituents, although some cohesion can be wrested from it.

Following Old I take b as further specifying the horses in a (áśvebhiḥ), with the bare numeral saptá substituting for the non-existent instrumental *saptábhiḥ as elsewhere. It could also specify the number of soma drinks in c (sómebhiḥ), and the position of the phrase between those two instrumental expressions allows it to be construed with both. The gen. pl. saptatīnā́m of course simply depends on the numeral.

In c I supply a form of √mad/mand to be construed with the instr.; so also Ge (ermuntert).

In d I supply a form such as maṃhase ‘you are ready’, which is common with dānā́ya, although Ge’s solution, to have the infinitive depend only on the “ermuntert” is certainly possible and probably neater. See also Scar 313.
