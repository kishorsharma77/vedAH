As noted in the publ. intro., the first hemistich seems to pick up the last one of the previous hymn (48.5cd), where Bhaga and Savitar are identified as the givers of desirable things. Āyu is always a somewhat mysterious figure in the RV, and in this case it is difficult to tell whether the gen. āyóḥ dependent on rátnam (also in 2d) is in possessive or indirect object use -- that is, are the two gods distributing treasure to Āyu or Āyu’s treasure to others. Ge seems to opt for the former, Re and WG the latter. In this case, the end of the last hymn may be helpful: V.48.5cd ná tasya vidma … yáto bhágaḥ savitā́dā́ti vā́ryam “We do not know that from which Bhaga and Savitar will give what is choice.” The ablatival yátaḥ ‘from which’ indicates the source from which they will acquire what they then distribute. If 49.1 is in some way responsive to this, āyóḥ should likewise indicate the source not the recipient of the treasure.

In the 2nd hemistich I tr. the vocc. narā purubhujā … aśvinā as if acc., to avoid extra fuss.
