“Seven” here is probably a loose indication of totality (so Oberlies, II.74) rather than a precise enumeration. The number may have been displaced from síndhuṣu: the rivers are generally seven.

VIII.39.8, 10: I do not understand the sudden prominence of the rivers/waters, esp.

the waters that in 10e are svásetu- ‘having/being their own bridges/dams’. Ge (n.

10de) thinks it alludes to the ritual sprinkling of the fireplaces with water, which may well be, but which does not explain the descriptor. In its other occurrence (X.61.16) svásetu- refers to a poet who crosses the waters (apáḥ … tarati) by having or making his own bridge. Are the waters providing Agni with a bridge for him to cross them? It may (or may not) be relevant that the waters/rivers are fairly prominent in the next hymn (VIII.40) to Indra and Agni.
