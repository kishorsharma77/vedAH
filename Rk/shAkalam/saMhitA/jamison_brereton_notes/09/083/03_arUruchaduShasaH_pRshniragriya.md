Further identification of soma and the sun. For pṛ́śni- and ukṣán- used of the sun, see, e.g., V.47.3; for the sun supporting the worlds, see X.170.4 (dedicated to Sūrya) yénemā́viśvā bhúvanāny ā́bhr̥tā “by whom all these worlds are borne.” As indicated in the publ. intro., I take the 2nd hemistich as expressing a reciprocal paradox: the forefathers were created as masters of artifice (māyāvín-) by the artifice (māyā́-) of Soma/the sun, but they also engendered him. I take the pf.

mamire as passive, with Gr. The standard tr. (and incl. HPS, B+I, 78) take the verb as transitive, supplying bhúvanāni from b as obj. (I do have to concede that the pf. is otherwise generally transitive.) But under their reading I don’t understand how the forefathers as possessing their own māyā́(māyāvínaḥ) needed “his māyā́” (asya māyáyā) to accomplish the task.

If there is any difference in meaning between māyāvín- (3x) and the far better attested and more orthodoxly formed māyín- I cannot detect it.
