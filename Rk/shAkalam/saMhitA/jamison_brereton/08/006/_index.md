Indra (1–45), Tirindira Pārsavya’s Da ́ ̄nastuti (46–48)  
Vatsa Kāṇva  
48 verses: gāyatrī, arranged in trcas ̥  
The Vatsa group contains only one hymn to Indra, but at forty-eight verses it is  one of the longest hymns in the entire R̥gveda. It is thus not surprising that the  hymn is not a tightly structured creation, but a fairly loose collection of three-verse  units treating various aspects of Indra. Nonetheless, certain themes are threaded  through the hymn, in particular the Kaṇvas’ role in strengthening Indra through  their poetry. This is strongly articulated in the first tr̥ca (vss. 1–3), in which the poet  Vatsa himself claims this role in verse 1, alongside his ancestral family in verses  2–3. This last verse contains the striking assertion that the Kaṇvas’ praise is their  “familial weapon,” which they “speak”—an image developed in verses 7–8, where  the Kaṇvas’ insights are blazing missiles. In the next tr̥ca (vss. 10–12) the poetic  “I” (presumably Vatsa) speaks of his poetic heritage. The tr̥ca consisting of verses  19–21 implicitly identifies the verbal products of the Kaṇvas with the physical obla tions of the sacrifice. (And pāda 20c contains a particularly opaque simile, whose  

meaning we are uncertain of.) Once again, in two adjacent tr̥cas (31–33, 34–36)  the Kaṇvas’ power to strengthen Indra by poetry is celebrated in straightforward  terms. The last tr̥ca before the dānastuti (43–45) begins with another mention of  the Kaṇvas’ activity.  
Interspersed among the Kaṇvas’ self-glorifications are tr̥cas of straight praise for  Indra. Tr̥cas 2 (vss. 4–6) and 5–6 (vss. 13–18) celebrate Indra’s might and his victories,  especially over Vr̥tra, and could be taken as examples of the Indra-strengthening  praise-poetry that the Kaṇvas attribute to themselves. The later Indra-oriented  tr̥cas (22–24, 25–27, 37–39, 40–42) are more concerned with the sacrifice, the invita  
tion and journey to the soma, and the goods and help the sacrificers hope to obtain  from Indra. In the midst of these is an enigmatic tr̥ca (vss. 28–30), which seems to  suggest a connection between the primordial birth of the god (Indra? Soma?) and  the origins of poetic inspiration.  
The hymn ends with a three-verse dānastuti, which, for a change, is far easier to  interpret than the hymn to which it is appended.
