Savitar  
Vāmadeva Gautama  
6 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 6  
This hymn conveys a much more intimate sense of our connection to Savitar than the  preceding hymn with its formal praises. This intimacy is achieved by the aorist of the  immediate past that opens the hymn announcing his epiphany—“he has arrived!”— and by the vocatives and 2nd-person address that follow. The closeness of our rela tionship with the god allows us to ask him for something more personal than the  shelter and support requested in IV.53, namely (in the middle verse, vs. 3) for Savitar  
to intercede on our behalf with anyone, divine or mortal, whom we have offended. The hymn also makes heavy use of the verb sū “impel” from which Savitar’s  name is derived: it is found in all verses but the first.
