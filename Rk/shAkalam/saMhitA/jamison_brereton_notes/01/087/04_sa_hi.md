As noted in the publ. intro., in contradistinction to all standard tr. I take the gaṇáḥ of d to refer to the poet Gautama, whose patronymic is Rāhūgaṇa, and consider the 2nd sg. reference of the 2nd hemistich as Gautama’s self-address. The other tr. assume that the flock of Maruts is being addressed.

All standard tr. also take pāda d as a single clause (e.g., Ge “darum ist die bullenhafte Schar ein Gönner dieser Dichtung”). But this interpretation fails to account for the medial position of áthā, which is otherwise almost invariably initial.

(Klein, DGRV II: 70-71, notes the anomalous position here but follows the standard tr.) I take áthā as clause initial, proclaiming Gotama’s identification with the Marut flock on the basis of the shared qualities stated previously.
