Indra
Gr̥tsamada
9 verses: jagatī, except triṣṭubh 9
The hymn begins with an announcement of the sacrifice to Indra, whose greatness  and strength entitle him to it. The middle verses of this hymn (vss. 4–6) present  Indra as the bull of the sacrifice and indeed describe all the other principal constitu ents of the sacrifice also as bulls. The portrayal of Indra as a bull in these verses  contrasts with that in verse 8, in which Indra is compared to a cow. However, this  image of Indra as a cow sets up the final verse (9). In this verse, which is also the  final verse of II.15–20, the poet compares the dakṣiṇā, or priestly gift he hopes to  receive, to a generous cow.
