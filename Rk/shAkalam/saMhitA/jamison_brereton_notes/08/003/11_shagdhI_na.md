title = "11"

Rather than construing vā́jāya directly with śagdhí, as Ge does (“Tu uns, was du kannst zum Siegerpreis…”), I interpret it as the object of the participle síṣāsate, attracted into the dative in the fashion of datival phrases like vṛtrā́ya hántave (e.g., III.37.5-6). For the VP see VIII.103.11 vā́jaṃ síṣāsataḥ. However, 12d śagdhí stómāya may support Ge’s interpretation.
