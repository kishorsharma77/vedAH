fg is somewhat hard to construe, in that there are three gods and two occurrences of yātayáj-janaḥ ‘setting the peoples in order’. Moreover, Varuṇa and Āryaman are directly adjacent to that epithet, but it is Mitra whose stable characteristic it is (cf., e.g., III.59.1 mitró jánān yātayati …). Mine is only one of the ways to handle the 3-into-2 problem.
