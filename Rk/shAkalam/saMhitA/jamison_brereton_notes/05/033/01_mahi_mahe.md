The first hemistich begins and ends with an etymological figure: #máhi mahé … taváse átavyān#. The taváse also repeats the same form from the preceding pāda.

I supply śrávaḥ ‘praise’ with máhi, since this is a frequent collocation. Sim.

Ge, though Kü (258) and WG take it as adverbial.

With Ge (/WG uncertainly) I reluctantly interpr. pāda-final nṝ́n as a gen. pl.

(or standing for a gen. pl.), as is sometimes necessary. Old interpr. it rather as a dat. pl., which I don’t understand.

With Ge I construe itthā́with taváse; I assume it adds strengthening to that repeated word. Kü (258) instead takes it as an expression of the method of praise: “auf diese Weise,” so apparently also WG, though muted (“also”).

In the 2nd hemistich the referent of asmai is at issue. The standard view (Ge, Old, WG) is that it refers to the singer, the “not so strong” I. In Ge’s interpr. this involves rendering asmai sumatím … cikéta as “der … diesem (Sänger) seine Gunst zugedacht hat.” That sumatí- could refer to Indra’s benevolence is easy, but ‘zudenken’ as an interpr. of cikéta is hard. This pf. stem ordinarily means either ‘take note of’ or ‘appear as’ (latter generally middle). WG give the pf. its usual meaning but this leaves asmai without much to do in the clause. By contrast, I take Indra as the referent of asmai. It is not rare for enclitic forms of this pronoun to refer to the subject: a reflexive is not necessary. Under this interpr. sumatí- has its common meaning ‘good thought’ = poem, and Indra takes cognizance of this sumatí-, which is “for him.” Cf. VII.31.10 prácetase prá sumatíṃ krṇ̥ udhvam where the sumatí- of the poets is intended for a god (Indra, in fact) in the dative who is characterized as prá √cit.
