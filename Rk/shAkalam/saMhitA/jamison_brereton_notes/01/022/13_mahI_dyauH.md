mahī́is grammatically ambiguous, as it can be either fem. singular or fem.

(or neut.) dual. Most tr. take it as the former, modifying only dyaúḥ, but all things being equal, it is preferable to take dyaúḥ as masculine (though fem. occasionally is unavoidable), esp. as mahī́by itself can refer to the earth without further specification. I see no reason why mahī́cannot be dual here, modifying the conjoined NP dyaúḥ pṛthivī́ca.
