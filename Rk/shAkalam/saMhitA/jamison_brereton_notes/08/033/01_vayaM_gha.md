This verse has at least one clear subject (vayám ‘we’ in a) and one clear verb (3rd pl. pári … āsate ‘sit around’ in d), but they do not match grammatically.

There are (at least) two solutions: either to supply a 1st ps verb with ab (or abc) (so Ge) or to assume a modulation from 1st ps to 3rd ps. because of the nom. pl. stotā́raḥ ‘praisers’ in d, which, by this interpretation, would be in apposition to vayám. (Ge acknowledges this possibility in his n.) Despite the awkwardness I prefer the second option, in part because there is no obvious verb to supply in the earlier part of the vs. -- though I admit that Ge’s “anbrausen” (√svar) is possible, given sváranti opening
vs. 2 and the parallels he cites in his n. for singers and waters as subjects of √svar.

The other problem is the application of the simile “like waters” in b. It is not immediately clear why we are like waters. I would like to connect the simile to the phrase pavítrasya prasrávaneṣu in c and suggest that the waters go in circles at this outpouring just as we take our seats in a circle. It is also possible that the waters are being compared to the pressings in the adjective sutā́vantaḥ “provided with pressings, (which are) like waters.” On both difficulties in this verse, see detailed discussion by Old.
