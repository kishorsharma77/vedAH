The first hemistich echoes 2ab, with a 1st sg. past tense of √śru, a dual pronominal obj. referring to Indra and Agni, of which a compared adjective (comparative / superlative) is predicated. See also Watkins 1995: 187.

In d I read with Old (and the standard tr.) prácarṣaṇī; see also Thieme (KlSch 252). This requires no change to the Saṃhitā text, but only to the Pp., which analyses the sequence as two words. The next pāda begins prá carṣaníbhyaḥ, which definitely consists of two words, which could easily have led to the Pp. separation.
