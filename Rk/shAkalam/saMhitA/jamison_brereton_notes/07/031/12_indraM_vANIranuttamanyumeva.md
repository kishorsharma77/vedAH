Because the vā́ṇī ‘choir’ in vs. 8 was qualified as marútvatī ‘composed of Maruts’, I supply Maruts here with pl. vā́ṇīḥ. It is also possible, and perhaps preferable, to assume that the plural indicates that several choirs are involved: both the Maruts and (we) the human singers.

In c barhayā could also be 1st sg. subjunctive, as Ge takes it. Either interpretation fits the context fine; I slightly prefer the 2nd sg. imperative, because it returns us to the imperatives of vss. 1-2.
