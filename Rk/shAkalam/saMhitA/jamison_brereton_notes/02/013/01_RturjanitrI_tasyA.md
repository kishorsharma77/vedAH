The standard tr. (incl. JPB) seem to assume that pári serves as a postposition with tásyā(ḥ), but the interposition of apáḥ and, esp., the close sandhi of apás pári make this difficult. JL suggests that apáḥ might have a double reading, as a rare singular form of áp- ‘water’, an ablative to be read with tásyā(ḥ), and as the more usual acc. pl., with which the pl. rel. yā́su agrees. Thus “just born from this water he has entered the waters in which he grows strong.” But the most likely referent of tásyā(ḥ) is the immediately preceding jánitrī, which refers to the season, so an abl. of water is unlikely. That pári might form a lexeme with ā́viśat is suggested by 8c ápariviṣṭam.

Note the alliteration in cd: pipyúṣī páyo … pīyū́ṣam prathamám, with the first terms of each pair echoing each other. JL suggests that áṃśóḥ pīyū́ṣam prathamám is in apposition to the páyaḥ phrase, rather than being, with most tr. incl. JPB’s, a nominative expressing the subject of ukthyàm, anticipating tád. This would allow the refrain to be a separate clause, as it overwhelmingly is in the rest of the hymn.
