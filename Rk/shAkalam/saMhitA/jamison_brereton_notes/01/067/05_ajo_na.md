Tr. of the subj. ajáḥ vary between ‘unborn’ (Ge, Re) and ‘goat’ (Old SBE, WG), but parallel passages show that it must be the shadowy divinity Aja Ekapad (“One-footed Aja”), whatever the ajá- signifies in that conjunction. (Old recognizes as much in his n.) Cf. esp. AV XIII.1.6 tátra śiśriye 'já ékapādó 'dr̥ṃhad dyā́vāprthiv ̥ ī bálena; also RV X.65.13 where ékapād ajáḥ is adjacent to divó dhartā́.

In our passage the word padá- appears in the next verse and gestures toward the epithet.

The pf. dādhā́ra is ordinarily always presential (Kü 261); Kü cannot decide whether the pf. of √stambh is presential or preterital, but at least in this context I think it matches dadhā́ra in value.
