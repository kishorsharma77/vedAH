Ge (/WG) treat this verse as containing an anacoluthon, with the plural pres.

part. stṛṇānā́saḥ modifying the 1st singular pres. vṛñjé: “(We) strewing …, I twist …” This seems unnecessary to me. I take the participle as predicated in a main clause, with the vṛñjé clause parallel: “They … are strewing the ritual grass; I twist (the grass) …” Although predicated present participles are much rarer than their past participle equivalents, they are not non-existent: the commentary so far as identified a fair number of examples that can be so interpr. and whose alternative interpretations are forced.

On turī́pa-, whose sense is fairly clear but whose etymology is not, see EWA s.v. purú vā́ram is emended by most to the bahuvrīhi puruvā́ram ‘having many choice things’, but there seems no reason not to accept the text as given. (The odd Pp.

reading vā áram can be ignored.)
