There are various ways to configure the nominals in the first hemistich, sámaneva vapuṣyatáḥ … mā́nuṣā yugā́, and their relation to the verb kṛṇávat. Most interpretors assume (I think correctly) that kṛṇávat takes a double accusative here (“make X into Y”), but which is the X and which the Y? Ge takes mā́nuṣā yugā́as the first object and sámaneva vapuṣyatáḥ as the second: “Er soll die menschlichen Geschlechter gleichsam zu anstaunenden Versammlungen machen,” but does not explain how masc. vapuṣyatáḥ can modify neut. sámanā. Old discusses the passage at length, but in all four translations he suggests as possible he also takes mā́nuṣā yugā́as the first object. However, this phrase is almost always an accusative of extent of time “through the human generations” (I.144.4, II.2.2, V.52.4, VI.16.23, VIII.46.12). If we take it that way here and thus exclude it from one of the two accusative object slots with kṛṇávat, the remaining two nominals can each take one of the slots. The point then is that generation after generation people/gods marvel at Indra, and all these people oohing-and-aahing are like big festive parties.
