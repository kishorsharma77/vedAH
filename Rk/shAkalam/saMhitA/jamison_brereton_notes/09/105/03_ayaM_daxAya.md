The a pāda in 105 decompounds dakṣa-sā́dhana- in 104 to dákṣāya sā́dhanaḥ. The two yáthā’s beginning 104.3b and c are replaced by ayám’s (also in a). The rest of b consists of the same datival purpose expression as in 104.3b. A superlative plus dative of benefit is found in both c pādas: 104.3c mitrā́ya váruṇāya śáṃtamaḥ, 105.3c devébhyo mádhumattamaḥ.
