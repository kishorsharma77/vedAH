Both Ge and Re render pávamānasya as simply the epithet Pavamāna, but this loses the parallelism between the two gen. sg. pres. participles that open and close the hemistich: pávamānasya … abhyundatáḥ. I render these participles as “while” clauses, to avoid the awkward “we choose the companionship of you who are Xing.”
