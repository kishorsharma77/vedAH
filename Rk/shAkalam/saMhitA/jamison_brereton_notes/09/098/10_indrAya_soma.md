The identity of “the god sitting on the seat” is unclear, though Sāy.’s suggestion (see Ge’s n. 10d) that it is the Yajamāna seems unlikely. I’d suggest rather Agni, on the basis of IX.92.2 sī́dan hóteva sádane camū́ṣu “taking his seat in the cups like a Hotar on his seat,” since Agni is the archetypal Hotar and √sad is a regular part of the Agni lexicon. Of course in IX it is Soma who is regularly sitting / seated, but he cannot be the indirect object here.
