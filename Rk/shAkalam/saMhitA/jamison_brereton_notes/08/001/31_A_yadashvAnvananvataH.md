Some lexical and syntactic problems here. First, though the most obvious noun to construe with ā́… ruham ‘I mounted’ is the acc. áśvān ‘horses’, in fact horses never get mounted in the RV, only chariots (including in the loc., VIII.22.9). I therefore construe ráthe with the verb here and take the horses loosely with śraddháyā.

The next question is the meaning of the adjective modifying the horses, vánanvataḥ. Ge connects it with vána- ‘wood’ and tr. “die ans Holz gespannten Rosse,” but, although there are undoubted occurrences of the stem vánanvant- that do mean ‘wooden’, I doubt that this is one of them. Among other things in the occurrence in nearby VIII.6.34 modifying matí- ‘thought’, ‘wooden’ is effectively excluded. I instead connect it with √van ‘win’, whose various participles cross each other so much that a blend of this sort would not be surprising. For further disc. see VII.81.3.

The second hemistich opens with the conjunction utá, which is a problem for any interpretation of this verse, since it is ordinarily a coordinating conjunction but the first hemistich is a subordinate clause (note the final accented verb ruhám conditioned by yád in a) and the second a main clause (unaccented verb ciketati).

Klein (I.451) is puzzled by the passage but suggests that if the chariot of the subordinate clause is a gift and the valuable goods is another prospective gift, “utá is thereby explained.” But his tr. of the verse clearly divides it into subordinate and main clauses. I simply leave it unexplained.

Finally, what is the value of ciketati? Old, followed by Klein, suggests supplying the patron as subject: “(then) will (the liberal one) take note (to give me) also (some) of the desirable wealth, which is the herd of Yadu” (tr. Klein I.451), taking the verb in the I/T meaning ‘perceives’. But this requires inventing a patron (although it is true that one appears in the next verse) and, more problematic, supplying a further verbal complement, not only “take note” but “to give me,” which seems to me to be taking more liberties with the text that we should. I therefore prefer to follow Ge in taking ciketati in its less common intransitive value, meaning ‘appears, stands out’ (see Ge’s notes for parallel passages, which interestingly are also dānastutis), with the relative clause of pāda d as its subject.
