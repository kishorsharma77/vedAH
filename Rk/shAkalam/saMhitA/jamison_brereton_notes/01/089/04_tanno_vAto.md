Ge (/WG) take the repeated tád’s of a-c (but not the one in d) as referring to the mayobhú … bheṣajám “the remedy that is joy itself” and supply verbs in pāda bc to support this object. Re by contrast takes the repeated tád as adverbial, ‘ainsi’. This is more or less what I arrived at, though ascribing somewhat more meaning to the adverbially used neuter pronoun. I assume it refers to the call embodied in the nivídof 3a (though nivíd- itself is fem.), which call is finally the suppressed object of tád … śṛṇutam “listen to this” in d.
