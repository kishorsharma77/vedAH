Note the phonetic echoes: (mahi)t(v)aná(m) … (ta)tāna … (é)tā ná … (áyā)tanā.

I take “greatness” (or “heroism [and] greatness”) to be the unexpressed subj.

of tatāna in b, rather than yójanam with Ge. The latter is an acc. of extent of space, and the phrase #dīrghám … yójanam# is iconically positioned to express the distance traversed.

In the second hemistich contra Ge and Re I take c as a separate nominal main clause, with d a temporal dependent cl. This allows the yád to be properly positioned, rather than occurring deep in the dependent cl. (The WG treatment is similar to mine.) The shared characteristic in the simile in c, ‘having ungraspable brilliance’ (ágṛbhītaśocis-), presumably refers to the combination of speed and timidity that characterizes antelopes, deer, and their ilk and makes them hard to catch. If we were to speculate more narrowly, the ‘brilliance’ might refer either to the conspicuous white spots on the coat of the chital deer or the white sides, underbelly, interior legs, and hindquarters of the blackbuck -- both species that seem native to the right location.

The puzzle in d is the phrase ánaśvadām … girím “the non-horse-giving mountain.” In order to approach it, we might first tackle the verb that governs it, ny áyātanā. The lexeme ní √yā is generally hostile; cf. nearby V.42.10 (also of the Maruts) yá óhate rakṣáso devávītāv / acakrébhis tám maruto ní yāta “Who(ever) will laud the demons at the invitation to the gods, run him over/down, Maruts, with your wheel-less (chariots).” In our passage the sense seems to be that the Maruts trample down or overrun a mountain whose behavior deserves it. But what is a non-horsegiving mountain? On the one hand, it may simply refer to a stingy mountain, comparable to a stingy patron, contrasted to aśvadā́- ‘horse-giving’ used of generous patrons elsewhere. But still, why horses? Mountains can be the source of nourishment and wealth; cf. I.65.5 gírir ná bhújma “a source of benefit like a mountain” (also VIII.50.2 and comm. ad I.55.3). But mountainous terrain is not particularly friendly to horses, which are most at home in open, relatively flat grasslands. I therefore wonder if the operable segmentation of the cmpd is anaśvadā́- ‘giving non-horses’ (rather than an-aśvadā- ‘not giving horses’). This might then be an oblique reference to the Vala myth and the mountain that yields up cows (that is, non-horses). However, since the Maruts are not generally associated with the Vala myth, this may be farfetched. The safest interpr. is Old’s deflection, that the phrase is “auf unbekannte Erzählung anspielend.”
