Soma Pavamāna  
Kavi Bhārgava  
5 verses: jagatī  
In addition to familiar tropes of soma-preparation (e.g., vss. 1, 3, 4), the hymn  briefly treats the famous myth in which a falcon steals soma from heaven (vs.  2), with one of the few R̥gvedic mentions of the heavenly archer Kr̥śānu, who  attempted retaliation. As noted, verse 4 for the most part is a standard soma verse,  but pāda c skates fleetingly and unemphatically over an apparent paradox, with a male Soma conceiving himself as his own embryo. In the final verse Soma is com pared to Varuṇa, because of his control over truth and deceit, and to Mitra, in his  role as mediator among communities.
