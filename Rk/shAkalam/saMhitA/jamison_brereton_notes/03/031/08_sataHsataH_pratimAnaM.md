Ge (/WG) take this vs. as a quotation of the Aṅgirases’ praise-song of Indra.

I do not see why. The vs. seems to follow easily from the preceding one, and in fact at the end of vs. 7 it’s Indra who’s singing (/chanting), not the Aṅgirases. We might expect such a quotation to be signposted in some way. I do not consider the 1st pl.

enclitic naḥ in c to be a sufficient signal.

The presence of Śuṣṇa in b is a bit puzzling, since the smiting of Śuṣṇa is not part of the Vala myth. Perhaps with Schmidt (173) he is mentioned because Indra is uncontestably Śuṣṇa’s killer, and this extra-mythic (or extra-Vala myth) association makes it clear that the unnamed subject of this vs. must indeed be Indra.

The standard tr. take c as a separate clause from d and supply a verb of motion with prá (e.g., Ge “[ging] … voran”). This is certainly possible, but cd can also be read as a single clause (so Schmidt, 168), since prá is frequent with √muc.

This interpr. allows, but does not enforce, a coreferential interpr. of naḥ (c) and sákhīn (d), as in my tr. (flg. Schmidt).

What calumny? Ge (n. 8d) suggests the dishonor because of the loss of the herd.
