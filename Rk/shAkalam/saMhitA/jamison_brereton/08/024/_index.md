Indra
Viśvamanas Vaiyaśva
30 verses: uṣṇih (except anuṣṭubh 30), arranged in trcas ̥
The first twenty-seven verses of this hymn are dedicated to Indra, while the final  tr̥ca (vss. 28–30) is a dānastuti of the patron Varo Suṣāman, with Dawn the divinity  addressed because of her association with the distribution of the priestly gift. The  first two verses of the dānastuti are unexceptional in diction and tone, but the last  verse (30) contains puns and neologisms, as often in dānastutis.
The rest of the hymn contains fairly standard praise of Indra, with special  emphasis on his generosity—rā́dhas “generosity” is something of a signature word  in the hymn, occurring six times—though his powers do not go unmentioned. The  need to praise Indra to stimulate his giving is also a recurrent motif in the hymn,  and the poet calls upon both himself (sometimes by name) and his companions to  provide that praise (see, e.g., vss. 1, 14, 19, 22–23). Such interactivity was also char
acteristic of the preceding hymn (VIII.23) to Agni.
The hymn consists of tr̥cas, but there is little unity within most of these triplets;  instead, there are a number of instances of cross-tr̥ca transitions (see, e.g., vss. 3/4,  6/7, 9/10). The poet also makes considerable use of alliteration and, especially, of  pairing derivationally related words. Verse 10 provides a particularly fine example  of the latter practice.
