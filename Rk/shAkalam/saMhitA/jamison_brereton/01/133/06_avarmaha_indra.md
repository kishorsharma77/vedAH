Dash the great ones downward, Indra; listen to us. For heaven has blazed  like the earth with fear, o possessor of the stone—as if with fear of
(the sun’s) heat, o possessor of the stone.
As the most tempestuous one, you speed with your tempestuous,
powerful weapons of death,
smashing those who are not men, o unopposable champion, along with  your warriors—o champion, along with your thrice seven warriors.
