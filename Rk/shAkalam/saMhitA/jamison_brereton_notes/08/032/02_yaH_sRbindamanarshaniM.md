Ge takes ánarśanim and ahīśúvam as PNs, in addition to sṛ́bindum and the familiar píprum. Mayrhofer (2003, Personennamen) is uncertain about ánarśani-.

Scar (538-39) tr. all as PNs as well, but discusses the possible interpretations of ahīśū́-. On the basis of the parallel he cites in IV.16.13 píprum mṛ́gayaṃ śūśuvā́ṃsam “Pipru Mrgaya, ̥ swollen with power,” with the pf. part. to √śū, I prefer to take ahīśū́- as a meaningful epithet. The question is then what the first member ahī- represents.

Although it would be easier to identify it with ahī́- ‘fertile cow’, which matches it exactly, I prefer to take it as a metrically lengthened version of áhi- ‘snake’, which makes more sense in the designation of a demon. See Scar (loc. cit.), also EWA s.v. ahī́-. All four occurrences of this stem would have four short syllables if the second weren’t long ī, but I do not otherwise have an explanation of the lengthening. But note prāśū́- below (16b) with the same lengthening before śū́-.

As for ánarśani- I would again prefer to give it full lexical value, relating it (as Gr does) to ánarśa-rāti- (VIII.99.4) ‘possessing non-harmful gifts’(?), arśasānádesignation of another demon. See EWA s.v. arśasāná-. However, the root etymology (supposed √arś/ṛś ‘harm’) is not strong, and the analysis remains uncertain. If it does mean ‘harmless’, the adjective is used proleptically, as is not uncommon.

The name of the first demon, Sṛbindu, displays non-Indo-Aryan phonology.
