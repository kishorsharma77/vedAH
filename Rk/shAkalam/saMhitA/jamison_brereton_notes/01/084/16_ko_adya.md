The consensus of modern tr. is that the objects that the subject is struggling to yoke are the priests (see esp. Ge), but I find this unlikely. The violent adjectival descriptors seem uncharacteristic for priests, but quite suitable for the Maruts, to whom the poet of this hymn (now drawing to a close) will dedicate the next four hymns. Note esp. that both śímivant- and mayobhū́- are used of the Maruts, once in the same hymn (VIII.20.3 and 24 respectively; for mayobhū́- see also I.166.3, V.58.2). I therefore take the Maruts as referents of the acc. pls. and also suggest that this verse is the pivot for the Marut reference found also (in my interpretation) in vss.

10-12. In that tṛca the Maruts are referred to in the guise of clearly feminine bovine figures; here the cattle (gā́ḥ) are the first acc. object we encounter. Because gó- has fluctuating gender, this form can of course be feminine (as the bovines were in 10- 12), but the immediate following adjectives establish it decisively as masculine. If both 10-12 and this verse refer to the Maruts, this verse returns them to their proper grammatical gender. Lüders (Varuṇa II.455) also thinks the Maruts are the referents.

ṛtásya can be construed with either dhurí or gā́ḥ, and tr. divide on which they choose. I attach it to the chariot pole in part because ṛtásya is often construed with a place (e.g., frequent ṛtásya yóni-), but the other is not impossible: cf. I.73.6 r̥tásya ...

dhenávaḥ.
