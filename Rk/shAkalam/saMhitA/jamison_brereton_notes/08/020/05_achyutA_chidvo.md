There are several ways to treat pāda a. The simplest (and to my mind the least satisfactory) is simply to take ácyutā as another subject of 3rd pl. nā́nadati (so, e.g., Schaeffer, Inten.). With Ge and Re, an intrans. ‘shake’ (vel sim.) can be supplied, on the basis of passages like VI.31.2b ácyutā cic cyāvayanta rájāṃsi, whose d-pāda ends ájman ā́te, very like this pāda. I favor a different solution: simply continuing yád éjatha “when you stir” from the preceding pāda (4d). Although the two verses do not belong to the same pragātha, the continuity of theme is clear.
