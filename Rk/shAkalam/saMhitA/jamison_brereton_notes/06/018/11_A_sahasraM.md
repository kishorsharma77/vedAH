Gr takes the referent of yásya as ‘wealth’ (see col. 1114, s.v. yótu-). But it is far more likely that it is Indra, whom we are urging to come here -- and whose arrival might be threatened by the actions of the ungodly man. (It is not possible to determine from Ge’s tr. (“den”) what he thinks the referent is.) The relationship between yāhí and yótoḥ might be clearer if the rel. clause were tr. “… never has the power to keep away.” On yótoḥ see now also Keydana (Inf., 77-78), who does not consider it a true infinitive. He takes yásya simply as the determiner of a gen. action noun yótu-. I am more inclined to see yótuḥ as an infinitive, and therefore consider yásya as an example of “attraction” to the case of the infinitive from an underlying obj. *yám.

The dative to the same stem does function as an infinitive and takes acc. rection: VIII.71.15 agním dvéṣo yótavai no gṛṇīmasi (cf. VIII.18.5 dvéṣāṃsi yótave).
