Savitar
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
6 verses: jagatī 1–3, triṣṭubh 4–6
The two halves of this hymn (vss. 1–3, 4–6) are distinguished by meter, and in fact  they appear to have been originally two hymns, which pattern together in vocabu lary and themes. Geldner suggests that the first is a morning hymn, the second an  evening hymn.
The parallelism is especially clear at the beginning: the first verses of each (1,  4) begin identically: “Up this god Savitar...” (úd u ṣyá deváḥ savitā́...) and fol low with a mention of his golden arms/hands. The second verses (2, 5) are each  appropriate for the time of day they represent: in the morning hymn (vs. 2) Savitar  impels the creatures forth to their daily activities, while in the evening hymn (vs.  5) he brings them to rest. The third verses (3, 6) make the expected pleas for help  and benefit from the god.
