viṣpitá- occurs only twice in Skt., here and in VII.60.7. In both occurrences it is the obj. of √pṛ ‘carry across, deliver’, and in both cases there is watery/nautical imagery. Its general value is clear -- a danger that is conceptually like a perilous water crossing -- but it has no good etymology. See EWA s.v. ### 05
Pādas ab appear to be a single clause with the middle part. ī́śānāsaḥ predicated to function as main verb. [Note in passing that Aufr’s typo ī́śānāśo with palatal, pointed out by Old, has been taken over uncorrected into the HvN text.] My tr. of c roughly follows Ge’s, though I have rendered īm (“it”). He supplies a form of √naś ‘reach’, on the basis of VIII.47.1 … ném aghám naśat “evil will not reach him.” I am hesitant about this interpr. because it requires supplying a main verb with no support in context, but I don’t see a viable alternative. Re takes c as contrastive with ab, with aghásya parallel to vāmásya (“vous êtes...les régisseurs de la grace / non point ... ceux du maléfice”), but he doesn’t explain the syntax, esp.

what he does with yát, which certainly shouldn’t represent his “ceux.”
