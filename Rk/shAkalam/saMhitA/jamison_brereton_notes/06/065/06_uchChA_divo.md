With some relief we can pass on from the clotted vss. containing the Maruts’ birth story to the considerably more straightforward terrain of their adult exploits. This vs. is, however, linked to the preceding one: ugrā́ḥ in 6a picks up the last word of 5, ugrā́n. It is also barely possible that suméke ‘well-fixed’ to √mi ‘fix, implant’ resonates with staunā́ḥ in 5c, if that means ‘post’.

As indicated in the publ. tr., the vs. is also structured by the pun on du. ródasī ‘(two) world halves’ and nom. sg. rodasī́, the PN of the Maruts’ consort, differing only by accent.

As noted by Old and Re, the simile marker ná is wrongly positioned, before the simile itself: ná rókaḥ rather than expected *róko ná. Re suggests it is to avoid vs.-final ná. But see the disc. above of 5c, with the ref. to von Bradke’s happy observation that (ta)sthau ná here matches the hapax staunā́(ḥ) in that pāda, which can easily account for the wrong placement here: the order was adjusted to facilitate the inter-vs. echo. My tr. also reflects my interpr. of sváśociḥ at the end of previous pāda as part of the postponed simile (sváśociḥ, … ná rókaḥ# “like a self-blazing light”). Although sváśociḥ can of course modify rodasī́, to which it is adjacent, taking it with the simile would not only put ná in expected, if distant, second position, but also produces a more effective simile in my opinion: “like a light” seems pretty lame, as if Rodasī was a glorified headlight, but “like a self-blazing light” has more oomph.
