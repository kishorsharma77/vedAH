See remarks ad vs. 3.

The part. viprayántaḥ presumably belongs to the lexeme ví-prá √i, but note that it could also be interpr. as belonging to a denom. *vipra-yá- ‘behave like [/seek] an inspired poet’, which would connect this vs. further with the poetic pervasion of vs. 3. The suggested denom. stem is not attested but could of course be easily formed, and I’m tolerably sure this pun was meant. Note vipāscítaḥ and vipā́, both in the matching vs. 3. I would now slightly alter the tr. to “going forth widely [/behaving like inspired poets].”
