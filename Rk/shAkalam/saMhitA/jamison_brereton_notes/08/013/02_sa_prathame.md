The word apsujít never occurs without an immediately preceding sám, whose function is not clear. See VIII.36.1-6, IX.106.3. Dissatsifaction with this expression goes back to Ludwig, and Scar (154-55) suggests that the phrase is a metrically more favorable version of *apsú sáṃjit “completely victorious in the waters.” This has some merit, but it’s also worth noting in this metrical context that there seems to be a feeling that a preverb is a good way to start the final four syllables of an Uṣṇih, and when in doubt sám is a safe one. See in the previous hymn VIII.12.16-18 sám índubhiḥ (though the sám is functional there), 22-24 sám ójase, - aḥ. In its other two occurrences (VIII.36.1-6, IX.106.3), sám apsujít is a separable 4- syllable pāda (as long as one accepts Old’s analysis of the meter of VIII.36; see comm. there).
