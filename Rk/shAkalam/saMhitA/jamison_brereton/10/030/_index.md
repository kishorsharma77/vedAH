Waters or Apām Napāt
Kavaṣa Ailūṣa
15 verses: triṣṭubh
This hymn is very ritually determined, and in fact it tracks closely the ritual acts  performed in the classical śrauta ritual at its recitation in the soma sacrifice. In verses  1–3 the Adhvaryu priests are sent to fetch water for the soma-pressing, but first make  an offering to the waters and the Child of the Waters (Apām Napāt). The Adhvaryus  then bring the waters to the sacrificial ground (vss. 4–9), with a reminder that they  (the waters) owe a favor to Indra, the principal drinker of soma, because he freed  them (vs. 7). More praise of the waters follows (vss. 10–12) as they approach the  place of sacrifice. They arrive in verses 13–14, and the pressing can begin in verse 15.
The feminine and enthusiastically yielding nature of the waters (the stem áp being feminine in gender) and their relationship to various masculine forces, the  Adhvaryus (vs. 2), Soma (vss. 5–6), and the gods (vs. 15), are also emphasized.
