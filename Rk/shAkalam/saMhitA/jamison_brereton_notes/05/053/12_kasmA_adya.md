The question kásmai … prá yayuḥ “to whom have they driven” returns us to the questions in vs. 2: kathā́yayuḥ / kásmai sasruḥ “How have they driven? To whom have they flowed?” The referent of kásmai in 2, the “good giver” (sudā́se), is further specified here as “one who has given an oblation” (rātáhavyāya), though with different roots ‘give’. This ring-compositional reprise brings to a close the descriptive portion of the hymn, and the poet turns to requests.
