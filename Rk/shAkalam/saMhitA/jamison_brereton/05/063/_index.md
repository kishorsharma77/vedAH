Mitra and Varuṇa
Arcanānas Ātreya
7 verses: jagatī
Like the previous hymn to Mitra and Varuṇa, this hymn is also a plea for monsoon  rains. It gives a vivid picture of the monsoons with their thunder and lightning (vss.  5, 6) and the coming of the rain (esp. vss. 1, 4). The poet uses sound repetition,  perhaps in imitation of echoing thunder or recurring lightning or perhaps simply  as a demonstration of his poetic ability:  2d...-vī ví caranti..., 3b... vícarṣanī,  3c citrébhir..., 4b carati citrám..., 5c ... citrā́ ví caranti..., 6b... citrā́m vadati  tvíṣī-..., and 7d...-vi cítryam.... Also across 3ab samrā́jā ugrā́ vr̥ṣabhā́ divás pátī,  pr̥thivyā́ mitrā́váruṇā vícarṣaṇī, the two lines have exactly the same metrical struc ture and repeated vowels in the same syllables.
The hymn several times refers to the māyā́, the “cunning” of Mitra and Varuṇa  (vss. 3, 4, 6, 7), which in its first and last attestations is described as the “cunning of  a lord (ásura)” (vss. 3, 7), thus connecting Mitra and Varuṇa’s ability to control the  rain by their cunning with their kingship. They are likewise twice called “sovereign kings” (samrā́j) (vss. 2, 3). The prefix sám- “together,” signifying their unifying rule,  contrasts with the repeated prefix ví- “apart,” which indicates the diverse things over  which they hold sovereignty. This theme is announced in 2ab, where they are called  samrā́jau over the world vidáthe “in its division.”
