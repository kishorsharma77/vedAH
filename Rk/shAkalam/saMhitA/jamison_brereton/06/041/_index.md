Indra
Bharadvāja Bārhaspatya
5 verses: triṣṭubh
Another invitation to Indra to drink the soma. The usual “drive” theme is also  present (vss. 1, 4, 5), but backgrounded. The emphasis is on the attractions of the  particular soma offered. Only in the last pāda of the last verse does the poet ask  Indra for something in return.
