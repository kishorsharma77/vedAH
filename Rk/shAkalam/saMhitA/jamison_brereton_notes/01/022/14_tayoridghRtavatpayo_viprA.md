The meaning of this verse is entirely obscure to me, and it comes as a surprise in a hymn (or set of hymns) displaying no other verbal tricks at all. (It is true that the Gandharva spreads obscurity almost every place he appears in the RV.) I might speculate that what the verse is conveying is that by their inspired hymns the poets have achieved a place in the highest firmament, where the Gandharva often seems to be located, and where they consume the luscious food produced by Heaven and Earth. If this speculation has any merit, the instr. dhītíbhiḥ should not be taken as an instrument of licking (“lick … with their poetic insights”), but rather as an instr.

of cause (“by reason of their [prior and successful] poetic insights”), so the publ. tr.

could be amended accordingly.
