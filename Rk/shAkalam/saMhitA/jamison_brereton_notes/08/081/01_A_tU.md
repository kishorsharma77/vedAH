The apparent etymological play between ‘handful’ and ‘hand’ is unfortunately only found in the English: ‘handful’ is grābhám, ‘hand’ is (mahā)hastī́.

The phraseology seems to belong to dicing; see Lüders (Würfelspiel, 49-50). though curiously Falk (Bruderschaft u. Würfelspiel) does not discuss this passage. See also IX.106.3.
