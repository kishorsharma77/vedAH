This vs. seems an attempt at sympathetic magic: animals, both domestic and wild, and humans (symbolized by their lights, presumably their fires) are all settling down for the night (though the time period is not explicit), and so should the bugs.

As anyone who’s ever been outside in a buggy place after dark knows, this magic is not necessarily going to work -- though it’s true that some types of bugs are active at dusk and then stop.
