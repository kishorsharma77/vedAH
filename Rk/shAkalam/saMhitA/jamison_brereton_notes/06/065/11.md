Note the fairly common bhrā́jad-ṛṣti- in a immediately following the identically formed hapax bhrā́jaj-janman- in 10d.

The final pāda has attracted more concerned comment than I think it deserves; see esp. the great fuss Old makes about it. The issue is what to do with the simile containing two nominatives giráyo nā́paḥ (= ná ā́paḥ), lit. “like mountains, waters.” The consensus seems to be that the two noms. convey a single image, with a more complex structure underlying it: namely the waters (of) the mountains, mountain water, Bergwasser. I don’t see why this is necessary; instead I think the thoughts are being compared both with moutains and with waters, which are both ugrá- in different ways. (Old allows this possibility.) Note that the adjectives qualifying the inspired thoughts, śúci- and ugrá-, were used of the Maruts earlier in the hymn, in 4c and 5c, 6a respectively.
