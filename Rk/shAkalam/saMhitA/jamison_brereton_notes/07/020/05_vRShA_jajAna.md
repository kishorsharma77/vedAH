Once again a particle is positioned oddly: ádha in the middle of the relative clause (versus properly positioned ádhā in 3d). Klein (II.130) suggests the ádha here “is either a subclausal conjunction [but conjoining what? sj] or weakly conjoins the second distich with the first,” but neither explanation accounts for the mid-pāda position.
