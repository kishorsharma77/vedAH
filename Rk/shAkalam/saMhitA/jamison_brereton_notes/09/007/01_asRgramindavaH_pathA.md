Lü (600-601) sees this vs. as representing the heavenly ascent of Soma, but those not subscribing to all of Lü’s presuppositions will find it difficult to see that. My own interpr. is far more earthbound: the filter is both the path of the soma and its foundation. The referent of asya in c is probably the soma, esp. given the near match of 1c vidānā́asya yójanam and 8c vidānā́asya śákmabhiḥ: the asya in 8c must be the soma. Even though in both passages the subject of the sentence is plural and refers to drops bzw. waves of soma, the sg. asya must be a constructio ad sensum.
