The two conjoined phrases ījānáṃ ca yakṣyámānaṃ ca (b) and pṛṇántaṃ ca pápuriṃ ca (c) have the same referent, and their syntactic parallelism invites a completely parallel interpretation of their verbal semantics. But the pairs are not morphologically parallel: the first phrase consists of a perfect part. and a future part., the second of a present part. and a reduplicated -i-stem adj. In the publ. tr. I render pápuri- as preterital (“who … has granted”), but following Grestenberger (JAOS 113.2 [2013]) I now see such forms as imperfectives, often with habitual or iterative sense; unfortunately in this context the conjoined phrase then seems almost pleonastic, though perhaps “the one who grants and keeps granting” would work.

I would also slightly alter the tr. of the phrase in b to “the one who has sacrificed and will sacrifice,” to make the parallelism of the two phrases in bc clearer and also to rule out a reading in which the two participles in b have different referents.
